Recommendations are without legal force but are negotiated and voted on according to the appropriate procedure. Recommendations differ from regulations, directives and decisions, in that they are not binding for Member States. Though without legal force, they do have a political weight. The Recommendation is an instrument of indirect action aiming at preparation of legislation in Member States, differing from the Directive only by the absence of obligatory power. Common market According to the terms of the Treaty on European Union \\"In order to ensure the proper functioning and development of the common market, the Commission (‚Ä¶) formulate recommendations or deliver opinions on matters dealt with in this Treaty, if it expressively so provides or if the Commission considers it necessary.\\" Concretely, recommendations can be used by the Commission to raze barriers of competition caused by the establishment or the modification of internal norms of a Member State. If a country does not conform to a recommendation, the Commission cannot propose the adoption of a Directive aimed at other Member Countries, in order to elide this distortion. See also * EUR-Lex References * External links * EUROPA Recommendation ","title":"Recommendation (European Union)"},{"id":"165300","text":"A directive is a legal act of the European Union which requires member states to achieve a particular result without dictating the means of achieving that result. It can be distinguished from regulations, which are self-executing and do not require any implementing measures. Directives normally leave member states with a certain amount of leeway as to the exact rules to be adopted. Directives can be adopted by means of a variety of legislative procedures depending on their subject matter. The text of a draft directive (if subject to the co-decision process, as contentious matters usually are) is prepared by the Commission after consultation with its own and national experts. The draft is presented to the Parliament and the Council‚Äîcomposed of relevant ministers of member governments, initially for evaluation and comment then subsequently for approval or rejection. Justification There are justifications for using a directive rather than a regulation: (i) it complies with the EU's desire for \\"subsidiarity\\"; (ii) it acknowledges that different member States have different legal systems, legal traditions and legal processes; and (iii) each Member State has leeway to choose its own statutory wording, rather than accepting the Brussels' official \\"Eurospeak\\" terminology. So, for example, while EU Directive 2009/20/EC (which simply requires all vessels visiting EU ports to have P&I; cover) could have been done perfectly well as a regulation (without bothering Member States to implement the directive), the desire for subsidiarity was paramount and thus a directive was the chosen vehicle.UK implementation Legal basis The legal basis for the enactment of directives is Article 288 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (formerly Article 249 TEC). The Council can delegate legislative authority to the Commission and, depending on the area and the appropriate legislative procedure, both institutions can seek to make laws. There are Council directives and Commission directives. Article 288 does not clearly distinguish between legislative acts and administrative acts, as is normally done in national legal systems. Legal effect Directives are binding only on the member states to whom they are addressed, which can be just one member state or a group of them. In general, however, with the exception of directives related to the Common Agricultural Policy, directives are addressed to all member states. =Implementation= When adopted, directives give member states a timetable for the implementation of the intended outcome. Occasionally, the laws of a member state may already comply with this outcome, and the state involved would be required only to keep its laws in place. More commonly, member states are required to make changes to their laws (commonly referred to as transposition) in order for the directive to be implemented correctly. This is done in approximately 99% of the cases. If a member state fails to pass the required national legislation, or if the national legislation does not adequately comply with the requirements of the directive, the European Commission may initiate legal action against the member state in the European Court of Justice. This may also happen when a member state has transposed a directive in theory but has failed to abide by its provisions in practice. Britain passed a statutory instrument, the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994UTCCR 1994 The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994 ‚Äì SI 1994/3159, to implement the EU Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993.National provisions communicated by the member states concerning Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts For reasons that are not clear, the 1994 SI was deemed inadequate and was repealed and replaced by the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999.(SI 1999/2083) The Consumer Rights Act 2015, a major UK statute consolidating consumer rights, then abolished the 1999 SI; so presumably the 2015 Act complies with the 1993 EU directive, which remains extant. =Direct effect= Even though directives were not originally thought to be binding before they were implemented by member states, the European Court of Justice developed the doctrine of direct effect where unimplemented or badly implemented directives can actually have direct legal force. In the important case of Francovich v. Italy, the ECJ extended the principle of Van Gend en Loos Van Gend en Loos: EU Treaties are capable of creating legal rights enforceable by both natural and legal persons in the courts of Member States. to provide that Member States who failed to implement a directive could incur liability to pay damages to individuals and companies who had been adversely affected by such non-implementation.

It provided pay-for-service radio, analog to cable television. Its service included 73 different music channels, 39 news, sports, talk and entertainment channels, 21 regional traffic and weather channels and 23 play- by-play sports channels. XM channels were identified by Arbitron with the label \\"XM\\" (e.g., \\"XM32\\" for \\"The Bridge\\"). The company had its origins in the 1988 formation of the American Mobile Satellite Corporation (AMSC), a consortium of several organizations originally dedicated to satellite broadcasting of telephone, fax, and data signals. In 1992, AMSC established a unit called the American Mobile Radio Corporation dedicated to developing a satellite-based digital radio service; this was spun off as XM Satellite Radio Holdings, Inc. in 1999. The satellite service officially launched on September 25, 2001. On July 29, 2008, XM and former competitor Sirius Satellite Radio formally completed their merger, following U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval, forming Sirius XM Radio, Inc. with XM Satellite Radio, Inc. as its subsidiary. On November 12, 2008, Sirius and XM began broadcasting with their new, combined channel lineups. On January 13, 2011, XM Satellite Radio, Inc. was dissolved as a separate entity and merged into Sirius XM Radio, Inc. Services While the satellite receiver radio service was its primary product, XM also operated audio, data and advertising services. =Satellite radio= XM's primary business was satellite radio entertainment. XM carried music, news (both simulcast and syndicated programming), sports, talk radio, comedy (both stand-up and radio shows), and radio drama. In addition, XM broadcast local weather and traffic conditions in its larger markets. XM Satellite Radio logo from 2001‚Äì2006 =XM Radio Online= XM Radio's online player prior to their merge with Sirius XM Radio Online (XMRO), XM's Internet radio product, offered many of XM's music stations and could be accessed from any Internet connected computer, or via the SIRIUS XM mobile app. =Weather and traffic= XM also provided data services such as weather information for pilots and weather spotters through its Sirius XM Weather & Emergency datacasting service. This information could be displayed in the cockpit of an aircraft equipped with a satellite weather receiver. =Commercial adoption and partnerships= In 2004, JetBlue announced that XM Satellite Radio service would be available in its Embraer regional jets beginning in 2005. Also in 2005, AirTran Airways began putting XM Satellite Radio on their aircraft. United Airlines started carrying XM programming in March 2006. Zipcar, an urban car-sharing service in the United States, initially installed XM receivers in all of their vehicles, but later announced they would be removed from its fleet in the following months due to uncertainty in the market. =Customer service= In contrast to its high- quality broadcasts, Sirius/XM's customer service has drawn fire from some state governments. In October 2010, Richard Cordray, Ohio's Attorney General, began investigating complaints regarding Sirius XM's policies on billing, customer solicitation and subscription renewals and cancellations. The company informed shareholders of the probe shortly thereafter. According to news reports, Arizona, Connecticut, Tennessee, Vermont, and the District of Columbia had expressed interest in participating in the inquiry. According to Reuters, \\"The investigations come as Sirius XM, home to programs by Howard Stern and Oprah Winfrey, has found its footing and distanced itself from years of huge losses and questions about its business model.\\" In a report obtained in March 2011, The Better Business Bureau reported receiving over 4,500 complaints against Sirius XM in the preceding 36 months, around half of which regarded the company's billing and collection practices. In Missouri, some people registered on the state's do-not-call list had complained about receiving repeated calls from Sirius XM workers or agents after cancelling their subscriptions. Some Florida customers had reported being billed for automatic renewals of accounts they had canceled. Further, Sirius XM was sued in federal court by a customer accusing it of deceptively raising prices. The report also stated that \\"Sirius, in a statement, said it was cooperating with the investigations and that it believed its 'consumer-related practices comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations.'\\" =Exclusive channels= *Faction Talk (formally: The Opie Channel) *KISS 104.1 *Mix *Nashville! *The Pink Channel *Rock@Random *Bollywood & Beyond *Fox Sports Radio *MLB Play-by-Play *Extreme Talk *America's Talk *Talk Radio *ATN-Asian Radio *ReachMD *XM Scoreboard *ESPN Xtra *Calendrier Sportif *XM Deportivo *Laugh Attack *Canada 360 *Quoi de Neuf  Company history = 1988‚Äì2000 = The American Mobile Satellite Corporation was founded in 1988. In 1991, Lon Levin joined the company. In 1992, the American Mobile Satellite Corporation created a new division known as American Mobile Radio Corp. Later that year, American Mobile brought in WorldSpace as an investor. On May 16, 1997, American Mobile Satellite and WorldSpace officially change the name of American Mobile Radio to XM Satellite Radio. Later that month, Lon Levin became president, a position he would hold until 1998. In October 1997, XM Satellite Radio obtains one of only two satellite digital audio radio service licenses offered by the Federal Communications Commission. In 1998, Hugh Panero President and CEO, joined XM Satellite Radio in the same role. In June 1999, Clear Channel Communications, DirecTV, General Motors, and a private investment group invest US$250 million in XM Satellite Radio convertible debt. On June 7, with GM's investment in XM, they enter into a 12-year \\"Distribution Agreement\\" between XM and GM subsidiary, OnStar Corporation. The agreement calls for exclusive installation of XM Satellite Radio into GM vehicles from November 12, 2001 until November 2013. OnStar must meet specific escalating installation rates each year, while XM must make extensive payments to OnStar for the installation and sale of XM in their vehicles, while sharing revenue earned from these radios with OnStar ‚Äì as well as payments on the exclusivity agreement. At the same time as the investment, American Mobile Satellite, still XM's parent company, reacquired the stake WorldSpace held in the company. In October 1999, XM Satellite Radio issues 10,241,000 shares of Class A common stock at an IPO price of US$12.00 per share. American Mobile Satellite remains the majority holder of the public company. In April 2000, American Mobile Satellite Corp. changed its name to Motient. In July, American Honda joined several private investors in a US$235 million preferred stock investment in the company. = 2001‚Äì2005 = On September 25, 2001, XM Satellite Radio launched in San Diego and Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth, with nationwide expansion plans set for November. The initial lineup included 100 channels consisting of sports, talk, children's programming, entertainment and news. In October 2001, Motient was heading into bankruptcy and spun off their non-XM satellite division into a joint operation with TMI Communications and Company, L.P., a wholly owned subsidiary of BCE Inc. of Canada. The new venture was known as the Mobile Satellite Ventures. In November, Motient was in bankruptcy, and sold off their controlling interest in XM to Hughes Electronics, SingTel and Baron Capital Partners. Hughes Electronics would go on to combine this new interest in with the interest already held by their subsidiary, DirecTV. On November 12, 2001, XM Satellite Radio marked the official launch of its nationwide service. In January 2003, the company underwent a re-capitalization plan, involving XM exchanging US$300 million in old debt for new debt, while deferring interest for 3-years on the notes. They also restructured payment obligations on the General Motors installation agreement, issuing a convertible bond to GM, issuing a warrant for shares to GM, and establishing a revolving credit facility with GM. The plan also included new funding coming from a placement of over US$300 million in 10% convertible bonds to a group of private investors. In 2004, General Motors sold Hughes Electronics to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and sold DirecTV's interest in XM Satellite Radio. On March 1, XM Radio launched Instant Traffic and Weather Channels for major metropolitan markets in the United States. Also in 2004, the company partnered with automakers General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen, and SAAB to offer in-dash XM receivers on an OEM basis. The Acura TL is the first luxury automobile to offer XM radio as \\"standard\\" in every vehicle. On October 4, 2004, \\"Shock\\" jocks Opie and Anthony begin broadcasting on a premium XM Satellite Radio station. Also, former National Public Radio host Bob Edwards broadcasts the first Bob Edwards Show on XM Public Radio, channel 133. On October 20, XM announces an 11-year, US$650 million deal with Major League Baseball to broadcast games live nationwide and become the Official Satellite Radio provider of Major League Baseball. The agreement grants XM the rights to use the MLB silhouetted batter logo and the collective marks of all major league clubs. As part of the deal, XM created a 24/7 MLB channel called \\"Home Plate\\". The deal started with the 2005 season and ran through the 2012, with a 3-year option that MLB could pick up. On January 5, 2005, XM introduced two new XM2go models: Pioneer's AirWare and the Tao from Giant International. On February 28, XM's third satellite, Rhythm, was successful launched. On March 3, XM becomes the exclusive satellite partner of the Indy Racing League and Indianapolis 500 (IMS Radio Network). On April 11, XM announced that a deal has been reached to be the official satellite radio network of Air America Radio. On May 28, the Wall Street Journal reported that XM had been awarded the contract for the XM 5 spacecraft to Space Systems/Loral. On June 7, XM partnered with Audible.com to offer downloadable audio show archives of The Opie and Anthony Show, as well as The Bob Edwards Show. On August 1, XM announced a three-year partnership with the United States Tennis Association to broadcast the US Open tournament through 2007, as well as weekly reports from other US Open Series events. On September 12, XM announced a 10-year US$100 million deal to carry National Hockey League broadcasts beginning with the 2005‚Äì06 season, initially sharing the coverage with SIRIUS but gaining satellite-radio exclusivity from 2007 onward. On November 29, XM launched service in Canada. = 2006‚Äì2010 = In January 2006, XM began broadcasting Fox News Talk. On January 9, XM won top honors at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show. On February 9, XM announced a $55 million three-year deal with Oprah Winfrey's Harpo Productions. In May 2006, XM Satellite Radio was sued by the RIAA over XM's new portable devices the Inno and Helix. The RIAA claimed these devices were equivalent to a downloading service, whereas XM contended the devices were protected because they recorded similar to a videotape. XM's portable devices allowed the consumer to record a portion of their broadcast similar to a VCR, DVR, or cassette player and play it back later. On January 19, 2007, a district judge ruled that the RIAA could proceed with the lawsuit, rejecting XM's defense that the conduct alleged in the complaint‚Äîif proved by the RIAA‚Äîwould be immune under the Audio Home Recording Act of 1991. On July 24, 2006, Nate Davis, formerly of XO Communications, was made the president and chief operating officer. In October, the XM-4 \\"Blues\\" satellite was launched atop a Zenit 3SL rocket. On January 18, 2007, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that licensing regulations would prohibit a possible merger of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio. On February 19, XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. and Sirius Satellite Radio announced they would merge. On March 20, 2007, XM and Sirius Satellite Radio filed a \\"Consolidated Application for Authority to Transfer Control\\" at the FCC. On July 24, XM announced that CEO Hugh Panero would leave the company in August, and that then-current President and COO Nate Davis would step in to serve as President and interim CEO. On March 24, 2008, the United States Department of Justice approved the merger of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio. On July 26, the FCC approved the XM-Sirius merger and on July 29, Sirius and XM officially merged as Sirius XM Radio. XM Canada and Sirius Canada, subsidiaries of the parent companies remained separate until April 2011. On February 10, 2009, XM prepared to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy. SIRI had a $1 billion debt obligation in 2009 and $175 million immediate obligation due February 17, 2009. On November 12, Gary Parsons resigned as chairman and was replaced by Eddy W. Hartenstein, as the new non-executive chairman. On November 24, 2010, XM Canada and Sirius Canada announced plans to merge. = 2011‚Äìpresent = On April 11, 2011, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission approved the merger of Sirius and XM branches in Canada into Sirius XM Canada. = Technology = XM provided digital programming directly from two high-powered satellites in geostationary orbit above the equator: XM Rhythm at 85¬∞ west longitude and XM Blues at 115¬∞ west longitude in addition to a network of ground-based repeaters. The combination of two satellites and a ground-based repeater network was designed to provide gap-free coverage anywhere within the contiguous U.S., the southern tip of Alaska, and in the southern part of Canada. The signal could also be received in the Caribbean Islands and most of Mexico (reports have stated that areas north of Acapulco were able to receive a steady signal), however XM is not yet licensed for reception by paid subscribers living in these areas. The original satellites, XM-1 (\\"Rock\\") and XM-2 (\\"Roll\\") suffered from a generic design fault on the Boeing 702 series of satellites (fogging of the solar panels), which means that their lifetimes were shortened to approximately six years instead of the design goal of 15 years. To compensate for this flaw, XM-3 (\\"Rhythm\\") was launched ahead of its planned schedule on February 28, 2005 and moved into XM-1's previous location of 85¬∞ WL. XM-1 was then moved to be co-located with XM-2 at 115¬∞ WL, where each satellite operated only one transponder (thus broadcasting half the bandwidth each) to conserve energy and cut the power consumption in half while XM-4 (\\"Blues\\") was readied for launch. Subsequently, XM launched ground-spare XM-4 (\\"Blues\\") ahead of schedule on October 30, 2006 into the 115¬∞ WL location to complete the satellite replacement program. On December 15, 2006 XM-1 was then powered down and drifted back to its original location at 85¬∞ WL, where it will remain as a backup to XM-3. XM-2 as well was powered down and remains as a backup to XM-4. This makes the current active satellites as XM-3 \\"Rhythm\\" and XM-4 \\"Blues\\" with two in-orbit spares. NoMa ‚Äì Gallaudet University Metro station. On June 7, 2005, Space Systems/Loral announced that it had been awarded a contract for XM-5. XM-5 will feature two large unfurlable antennas. Sirius' Radiosat 5, also to be built by Loral, will have a similar single large antenna. In American and Canadian metropolitan areas, XM and its Canadian licensee \\"Canadian Satellite Radio\\" (CSR) and operating as Sirius XM Canada, owned and operated a network of approximately 900 terrestrial repeater stations, meant to compensate for satellite signal blockage by buildings, tunnels, and bridges. In the United States XM owned and operated approximately 800 repeater sites covering 60 markets; in Canada CSR was installing approximately 80 to 100 repeaters that was planned to be owned and operated by CSR in the 16 largest Canadian cities. The actual number of repeater sites varies as the signal is regularly tested and monitored for optimal performance. The actual number of sites in the United States has dropped from the original 1,000 installed when the service first launched in 2001. The repeaters transmit in the same frequency band as the satellites. A typical city contains 20 or more terrestrial stations. Typically, the receiver owner is unaware when a terrestrial station is being used, unless he or she checks antenna information from the receiver being used. Due to a FCC filing in October 2006, the latest list of XM's US terrestrial repeater network was made available to the public. The XM signal used 12.5 MHz of the S band: 2332.5 to 2345.0 MHz. XM provided 128 kilobits per second of its bandwidth to OnStar Corporation for use with XM-enabled GM vehicles, regardless of whether their owners are XM subscribers. American Honda also retained the right to some of the company's bandwidth to transmit messages to Acura vehicles via a service known as AcuraLink. XM NavTraffic, an optional service, transmitted coded traffic information directly to vehicle navigation systems using TMC technology. Audio channels on XM were digitally compressed using the CT-aacPlus (HE-AAC) codec from Coding Technologies for most channels, and the AMBE codec from Digital Voice Systems for some voice channels, including all of the Traffic and Weather channels. The XM radio signal was broadcast on 6 separate radio carriers within the 12.5 MHz allocation. The entire content of the radio service, including both data and audio content, was represented by only two carriers. The other 4 carriers carried duplicates of the same content to achieve redundancy through signal diversity. The data on each carrier is encoded using time-delayed and error- correction schemes to enhance availability. Effectively the total radio spectrum used for content is a little over 4 MHz. This XM patent describes the carrier allocation scheme Each two-carrier group broadcast 100 8-kilobit-per- second streams in approximately 4 MHz of radio spectrum. These streams were combined using a patented process to form a variable number of channels using a variety of bitrates. Bandwidth is separated into segments of 4-kilobit-per- second virtual \\"streams\\" which are combined to form audio and data \\"channels\\" of varying bitrates from 4 to 64 kilobits-per-second. XM Patent Method and apparatus for audio output combining XM preprocessed audio content using Neural Audio processors that are optimized for the aacPlus codec, including spectral band replication (SBR). Audio was stored digitally in Dalet audio library systems using an industry-standard MPEG-1 Layer II at 384 kbit/s, sometimes known as MUSICAM. The audio is further processed by the Neural Audio processors on the way to broadcast. In the past, the Sirius XM Pops channel, which aired classical music, was broadcast in 5.1 surround sound audio quality. The technology, titled XM HD Surround, is the result of a partnership between XM and Neural Audio Corporation which provides content with six discrete channels of digital audio. The former XM Live channel also broadcast in this format for certain concerts and studio performances. XM manufacturing partners such as Denon, Onkyo, Pioneer Electronics (USA) Inc., and Yamaha introduced home audio systems capable of playing XM HD Surround. It is not known if the XM HD Surround technology is used on the service in 2015. = Satellites = * XM 1 (Roll). Launch occurred May 8, 2001.https://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/xm-1.htm * XM 2 (Rock).

Clear Channel programming agreement In 1998, Clear Channel Communications invested in XM. The companies entered into agreements which provided for certain programming and director designation arrangements as long as Clear Channel retained the full amount of its original investment in XM. One positive consequence of this was that XM had (and still has) exclusive programming rights to all Clear Channel content, including popular national shows like Coast to Coast AM, but the shows could only be broadcast inside the bandwidth controlled by Clear Channel. In June 2003, Clear Channel entered into a forward sales agreement relating to its ownership of XM. During the third quarter of 2005, Clear Channel and XM arbitrated the impact of this agreement on the Operational Assistance Agreement and the Director Designation Agreement. The Arbitration Panel decided that the Operational Assistance Agreement would remain in effect, including Clear Channel's right to receive a revenue share of commercial advertising on programming it provides to XM, but declined to enforce the Director Designation Agreement, which forced the Mays family members off the board of directors. Per the original agreement, Clear Channel had the right to program 409.6 kbit/s (or 10%) of XM bandwidth, requiring XM to include commercial advertising on the existing Nashville!, KISS, Mix, and Sunny (now The Music Summit). The amount of advertising on the music channels amounts up to 4 minutes per hour, similar to the amount of advertising XM included before going commercial free. Exceptions include syndicated music shows which carry network spots. Clear Channel advertising on XM is handled by its subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks. Clear Channel also provided existing talk channel programming (Fox Sports Radio, Extreme XM, Talk Radio). Clear Channel also controlled America Right (formerly Buzz XM), but through a series of show swaps, most non-Clear Channel content was removed and programming control returned to XM Radio. Plans to introduce new regional based talk channels, which would have featured a regional 5 minute newscast for each area of the country, were canceled. Instead, Clear Channel chose to introduce other music and talk channels. Newer channels including ReachMD, America's Talk remain on the air. The Pink Channel, National Lampoon Comedy Radio, WSIX-FM, WLW, and Rock@Random were launched and later removed, and replaced by channels like Bollywood & Beyond, The Music Summit, and Sixx Sense, all of which are on the air today. Seen as a blow to XM's 100% commercial-free music channel status, XM Executive Vice President of Programming Eric Logan released a programming announcement to XM subscribers on the company's website that reiterated XM's commitment to commercial-free music while noting that XM still had the most commercial-free music and that more commercial-free music channels will be added in the near future to ensure that XM will still have more commercial-free music than competitor Sirius Satellite Radio. On April 17, 2006, XM launched US Country (XM17), Flight 26 (XM26), XM Hitlist (XM30) and Escape (XM78) to provide commercial free music in the formats of the Clear Channel programmed music channels which were going to begin airing commercials. In response, Sirius has advertised that they are the only satellite radio provider that has 100% commercial-free music channels. Both XM and Sirius air commercials on their news, talk, and sports channels. The Clear Channel forward sales agreement with Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc was terminated on August 2, 2006. The termination resulted in Clear Channel Investments, Inc. paying Bear Stearns a total of $83.1 million, which was the value of Clear Channel's stake in XM. The accreted value of the debt was $92.9 million, and the fair value of the collar was an asset of $6.0 million, which resulted in a net gain of $3.8 million for Clear Channel. PCR and DirectPCR At the heart of the TimeTrax controversy was the XM PCR: a computer-controlled XM Receiver. Unlike the other receivers, which could be used in the car or home stereo, the XM PCR required a computer to run. A software application on the computer acted as the radio's controls and display, which led to a flurry of third party developers, who wanted to make a PCR replacement. Many of them received Cease and Desist letters from the XM company. Once the PCR was discontinued, for the reasons listed above, people found that the XM Direct, a receiver intended to be used in satellite-ready car stereos, can be connected to a computer with a very simple adapter cable. Some people have dubbed the entire kit, with receiver, cable, and software, the Direct PCR. While the original PCR software does not control the XM Direct receiver, several community developers have continued to develop PCR replacement software. Merger with Sirius Satellite Radio On February 19, 2007, XM announced a merger deal with Sirius Satellite Radio. The merger combined the two radio services and created a single Satellite Radio network in the United States and Canada. The United States Department of Justice announced on March 24, 2008 that it had closed its investigation of the merger because it \\"concluded that the evidence does not demonstrate that the proposed merger of XM and Sirius was likely to substantially lessen competition.\\" On June 16, 2008, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin told the Washington Post that he had decided to approve the XM-Sirius Merger after the companies agreed in the previous week to concessions intended to prevent the new company from raising prices or stifling competition. Martin issued an order to approve the merger, according to The Wall Street Journal ‚Äì setting the stage for a final vote which could have occurred any time after his recommendation was circulated. The XM‚ÄìSirius merger gained its final governmental approval from the Federal Communications Commission on July 25, 2008, with Martin and commissioners Robert M. McDowell and deciding vote Deborah Taylor Tate voting in the affirmative. As a term of the merger, the combined company will be fined almost $20 million for failing to create and market interchangeable radios capable of receiving signals from both companies prior to the merger. iPhone, iPod Touch, BlackBerry and Android applications XM developed a software application for use on the Apple iPhone and Apple iPod Touch devices that allowed XM subscribers to listen to its programming over the Apple devices. The Sirius XM iPhone App became available in the Apple iTunes Store on June 17, 2009. All SiriusXM Internet Radio subscribers are able to download the application from the Apple iTunes App-Store for free. Listening on an iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch is included with some subscription packages, a separate fee is required with other packages. On February 4, 2010, SiriusXM released an app for the Research In Motion BlackBerry line of smartphones, including the Storm (Series 9500), Bold (Series 9000 and 9700), Tour (Series 9600) and Curve (Series 8500 and 8900). Like the Apple iPhone/iPod Touch application, the BlackBerry app is free but requires a SiriusXM subscription. SiriusXM is also available for download on Android devices through Google Play. The applications carry most of the XM music, talk, sports and entertainment programming, as well as some exclusive Internet-only content. The mobile applications also carry a select number of channels from the \\"Best of SIRIUS/XM\\" packages, dependent on the subscriber's subscription level. Canada In November 2004, Canadian Satellite Radio filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission to bring the XM service to Canada. Along with Sirius Canada and the consortium of CHUM Limited and Astral Media, CSR was one of three applications for national subscription radio services submitted to the CRTC. On June 16, 2005, the CRTC approved all three applications. The decisions were appealed to the Canadian federal cabinet by a number of broadcasting, labour, and arts and culture organizations, including the Friends of Canadian Broadcasting, CHUM Limited, and the National Campus and Community Radio Association. The groups objected to the satellite radio applicants' approach to and reduced levels of Canadian content and French-language programming, along with the exclusion of Canadian non-commercial broadcasting. After a lengthy debate, Cabinet rejected the appeals on September 9, 2005. XM's Canadian channels appeared on US receivers on November 17, 2005. On November 29, 2005, XM Canada officially launched.

CFSP deals only with a specific part of the EU's external relations, which domains include mainly Trade and Commercial Policy and other areas such as funding to third countries, etc. Decisions require unanimity among member states in the Council of the European Union, but once agreed, certain aspects can be further decided by qualified majority voting. Foreign policy is chaired and represented by the EU's High Representative, currently Josep Borrell. The CFSP sees the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) as responsible for the territorial defence of Europe and reconciliation. However, since 1999, the European Union is responsible for implementing missions such as peacekeeping and policing of treaties. A phrase often used to describe the relationship between the EU forces and NATO is \\"separable, but not separate\\". The same forces and capabilities form the basis of both EU and NATO efforts, but portions can be allocated to the European Union if necessary. History=1957‚Äì1993= Co-operation in international trade negotiations, under the EU's Common Commercial Policy, dates back to the establishment of the community in 1957. The CFSP itself has its origins in the formation of European Political Co-operation (EPC) in 1970. European Political Co-operation was an informal consultation process between member states on foreign policy matters, with the aim of creating a common approach to foreign policy issues and promoting both the EC's own interests and those of the international community as a whole. This includes promoting international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law.By Article 11 of the Maastricht Treaty. =1993‚Äì2009: pillar system= The weaknesses evident in EPC, apparent, for example during the Yugoslav wars, led to a desire to strengthen foreign policy. That was consolidated in the Maastricht Treaty, which entered into force in 1993 and established the European Union. While the previously existing supranational European Economic Community became one of three pillars, two more pillars were erected. The second CFSP-pillar was based on intergovernmentalism, which meant unanimity between members in the Council of Ministers and little influence by the other institutions. The Amsterdam Treaty created the office of the High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy (held by Javier Solana until 1 December 2009) to co- ordinate and represent the EU's foreign policy. =2009‚Äìpresent: Consolidation= The Treaty of Lisbon took effect in December 2009 and brought an end to the pillar system. The CFSP's status of being a \\"pillar\\" thus ended. Furthermore, in an effort to ensure greater co-ordination and consistency in EU foreign policy, the Treaty of Lisbon created a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, de facto merging the post of High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy and European Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy. Since December 2011 the High Representative (HR) is in charge of the European External Action Service (EEAS), which was also created by the Treaty of Lisbon. It essentially is intended to be a common Foreign Office or Diplomatic Corps for the European Union. Objectives According to Article J.1 of title V of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union defines and implements a common foreign and security policy that covers all areas of foreign and security policy, the objectives of which are to: * Safeguard the common values, fundamental interests, independence and integrity of the Union in conformity with the principles of the United Nations Charter; * Strengthen the security of the Union in all ways; * Preserve peace and strengthen international security, in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, as well as the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter, including those on external borders; * Promote international co-operation; * Develop and consolidate democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Elements=Types of policy= The European Council defines the principles and general guidelines for the CFSP as well as common strategies to be implemented by the EU. On the basis of those guidelines the Council of Ministers adopts joint actions or common positions. Joint actions address specific situations where operation action by the EU is considered necessary and lay down the objectives, scope and means to be made available to the EU. They commit the member states. Common positions on the other hand, define the approach that the EU takes on a certain matter of geographical or thematic nature, and define in the abstract the general guidelines to which the national policies of Member states must conform. =High Representative= The High Representative, in conjunction with the President of the European Council, speaks on behalf of the EU in agreed foreign policy matters and can have the task of articulating ambiguous policy positions created by disagreements among member states. The Common Foreign and Security Policy requires unanimity among the 27 member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular policy. Disagreements in CFSP, such as those that occurred over the war in Iraq, are not uncommon. The High Representative also coordinates the work of the European Union Special Representatives. With the Lisbon Treaty taking effect, the position became distinct from the Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers. The High Representative serves as the head of the European Defence Agency and exercises the same functions over the Common Security and Defence Policy as the CFSP. On 1 December 2009, Catherine Ashton took over Javier Solana's post as the High Representative, who has held the post since 1999. On 30 August 2014 it was announced by Herman Van Rompuy that Federica Mogherini would be the new High Representative, effective on 1 November 2014. =Bodies= There are a number of bodies set up within the context of the CFSP. Within the Council, there is the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC) configuration, essentially a meeting of foreign ministers and the Political and Security Committee or PSC, which monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the CFSP and contributes by delivering opinions to the Council of Ministers, either at its request or its own initiative, and also monitors the implementation of agreed policies. The European Defence Agency (EDA) encourages increase in defence capabilities, military research and the establishment of a European internal market for military technology. Two bodies carried over from the Western European Union (see defence, below) are the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and the European Union Satellite Centre (EUSC). The EUISS is the European Union's in-house think tank. Its mission is to find a common security culture for the EU, to help develop and project the CFSP, and to enrich Europe's strategic debate. The EUSC is providing analysis of satellite imagery and collateral data. Defence policy The Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) is the part of the CFSP that relates to defence and crisis management, implemented by EU structures in CSDP missions drawing on civilian and military assets provided by member states. Based on articles 42‚Äì46 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU),Article 42, Treaty on European Union the CSDP also entails a mutual defence clause amongst member states as well as a Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) in which 25 of the 28 national armed forces pursue structural integration. Article 42.2 of TEU states that the CSDP includes the 'progressive framing' of a common Union defence policy, and will lead to a common defence, when the European Council of national heads of state or government, acting unanimously, so decides. When participating in CSDP missions abroad for peace-keeping, conflict prevention and strengthening international security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter, the national armed forces may either act in an existing national force framework, as part of an intergovemental force made available to the CSDP through article 42.3 of TEU, such as the European Corps, or in EU Battlegroups. The Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP), currently Josep Borrell, is responsible for proposing and implementing CSDP decisions. Such decisions are taken by the Foreign Affairs Council (FAC), generally requiring unanimity. The CSDP organisation, headed by the HR/VP, comprises relevant sections of the External Action Service (EEAS) - including the operational headquarters (MPCC) of the Military Staff (EUMS) - a number of FAC preparatory bodies - such as the Military Committee (EUMC) - as well as four Agencies, including the Defence Agency (EDA). Since 2017, the CSDP has also been facilitated by a defence fund and a Coordinated Annual Review on Defence (CARD). =Neutrality= Although the Irish people were reassured of their neutrality before agreeing to the Nice Treaty, the Finnish Prime Minister, Matti Vanhanen, on 5 July 2006, while speaking to the European Parliament as Council President declared:European Parliament Debate (English Translation) europarl.europa.eu Nevertheless, a similar guarantee on neutrality in relation to the Treaty of Lisbon was granted to Ireland at the European Council of 18/19 June 2009: > The European Council also agreed that other concerns of the Irish people, as > presented by the Taoiseach, relating to taxation policy, the right to life, > education and the family, and Ireland's traditional policy of military > neutrality, would be addressed to the mutual satisfaction of Ireland and the > other Member States, by way of the necessary legal guarantees.  Stopping humanitarian atrocities  EU foreign policy is committed to the protection of human rights. Research suggests that rhetoric along these lines from EU decision-makers is consistent with actual EU foreign policy activity. Military and economic interventions by the EU are consistently more likely in countries where violence explicitly targets civilians. Geostrategic concerns also influence EU action, as the EU has been \\"most attentive to human rights violations in non-EU European states, followed by countries in sub-Saharan Africa, while it has been least active in Asia and the Americas\\". Counterterrorism policy The European Union considers to be terrorist organisations those groups or those entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by persons who commit or attempt to commit terrorist acts, participating in these groups, or facilitating the execution of terrorist plans. It also includes defining those groups and entities acting on behalf or under the direction of such persons, groups and entities, including funds derived or generated from property owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such persons or by associated persons, groups and entities. The watch list was reviewed for the Law Library of Congress in 2007.loc.gov: \\"EUROPEAN UNION: LISTS OF TERRORIST PERSONS OR ORGANIZATIONS\\" Directorate of Legal Research LL File No. 2007-03957, June 2007 The European Union gives a definition of terrorism as Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001,COUNCIL COMMON POSITION of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism also referred to by successive acts. It highlights them as intentional acts which, given their nature or context as defined crimes under domestic law, may seriously harm a State or an international organization when committed for the purpose of: * seriously intimidating a population * unduly compelling a Government or international organization to perform or abstain from performing any act * seriously destabilizing or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social constructs =List of terrorist organisations= The list of terrorist organisations was started in 2001 with the 13 organisations listed on 27 December of Common Position 2001/931/CFSP. The European Community had not listed Al-Qaeda although the 9/11 attacks had been the instigator of the list. It has been updated by a number of subsequent declarations, such as Common Position 2006/231/CFSP of 21 December 2005; for example so as to include LTTE. Common Position 2005/847/CFSP of the European Council of 29 November 2005 updated the list of these organizations,COUNCIL COMMON POSITION 2005/847/CFSP of 29 November 2005 updating Common Position 2001/931/CFSP on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism and repealing Common Position 2005/725/CFSP which are as follows: *Abu Nidal *Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades *Al-Aqsa eV *Al-Takfir wa-l- Hijra *Aum Shinrikyo *Babbar Khalsa *Communist Party of the Philippines, including the New People's Army *Continuity Irish Republican Army (CIRA) *ETA / Bath Tierra y Libertad / Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA), which includes organizations: KAS, Xaki, Ekin, Jarrai-Haika-Segi and Gestoras pro Amnist√≠a *Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya *Islamic Front of the great fighters of the East *Grupos de Resistencia Anti-Fascist Primero de Octubre / 1 October, anti- fascist resistance group (GRAPO) *Hamas, including 'Izz Brigades al-Din al- Qassam *Hizbul Mujahideen *Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development *International Sikh Youth Federation *International Solidarity *Kahane Chai *Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) *Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) *Mujahedin-e Khalq (MKO or MEC), except for the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) *National Liberation Army / Ej√©rcito de Liberaci√≥n Nacional (ELN) *Orange Volunteers (OV) *Front for the Liberation of Palestine *Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, also known as the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) *Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command (PFLP-GC) *Real IRA *Red Brigades for the Construction of the Communist Party Fighter (BR-PCC) *Red Hand Defenders (RHD) *Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) *Revolutionary Nuclei / Epanastatiki Pirines *Revolutionary Organization 17 November / Dekati Evdomi Noemvri *Devrimci Sol or Army / Front / Revolutionary People's Liberation Party (DHKP / C) *Revolutionary Popular Struggle / Epanastatikos Laikos Agonas (ELA) *Partido Comunista Peruano - Sendero Luminoso / Shining Path (SL) *Stichting Al Aqsa Mosque (aka Stichting Al Aqsa Nederland, aka Al Aqsa Nederland) *Brigade XX Luglio *Ulster Defence Association / Ulster Freedom Fighters (UDA / UFF) *United Self-Defense of Colombia (AUC) *Core initiative proletarian revolutionary (results Inactive) *Informal Anarchist Federation including cell cooperative artisan fire, natural - occasionally spectacular Outside the CFSP Commission President has been an unofficial member of the G8, since 2014 G7 since the 3rd summit in 1977 (Shown: G8 at Heiligendamm, Germany in 2007) Besides its own foreign and security policy, the Commission is also gaining greater representation in international bodies. Representation in international bodies is previously through the European Commissioner for External Relations, who worked alongside the High Representative, but now with the High Representative directly as a Commission Vice-President. In the UN the EU has gained influence in areas such as aid due to its large contributions in that field (see below). In the G8 and the G20, the EU has the rights of membership besides that of chairing/hosting summit meetings. The EU is represented at the G8 by the presidents of the Commission and the Council. At the G20, its exact representation depends on the format of the individual meetings and may also include officials from the ECB. For all of these meetings, the EU has established informal processes to coordinate its policies. In the World Trade Organisation (WTO), where all 27 member states are represented, the EU as a body is represented by Trade Commissioner. The influence of the EU is also felt through the enlargement. The potential benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered a major factor contributing to the reform and stabilisation of former Communist countries in Eastern Europe. This influence on the internal affairs of other countries is generally referred to as \\"soft power\\", as opposed to military \\"hard power\\". An example of the support the European Union offers to the reform processes of its neighbours is EUBAM, the European Union Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine, which assists the governments of Moldova and Ukraine in approximating their border and customs procedures to EU standards. The European Union's influential economic status and its nation-like characteristics has been acknowledged by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in their publication The World Factbook. The EU was included in the Factbook in December 2004. =Humanitarian aid= The European Community humanitarian aid office, or \\"ECHO\\", provides humanitarian aid from the EU to developing countries. In 2006 its budget amounted to 671 million euro, 48% of which went to the ACP countries. Counting the EU's own contributions and those of its member states together, the EU is the largest aid donor in the world. The EU's aid has previously been criticised by the think-tank Open Europe for being inefficient, mis-targeted and linked to economic objectives. Furthermore, some charities have claimed European governments have inflated the amount they have spent on aid by incorrectly including money spent on debt relief, foreign students, and refugees. Under the de-inflated figures, the EU did not reach its internal aid target in 2006 and the EU would not reach the international target of 0.7% of GNP until 2015. However, only a few countries have reached that target. In 2005 EU aid was 0.34% of the GNP, which was higher than that of the United States and Japan. The ex commissioner for aid, Louis Michel, has called for aid to be delivered more rapidly, to greater effect, and on humanitarian principles.

It was named Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) before 1999. The pillar existed between 1993 and 2009, when it was absorbed into a consolidated European Union structure and became the area of freedom, security and justice. The pillar focused on co-operation in law enforcement and combating racism. It was based more around intergovernmental cooperation than the other pillars meaning there was little input from the European Commission, European Parliament and the Court of Justice.Police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters EU Glossary It was responsible for policies including the European Arrest Warrant. History It was created, on the foundations of the TREVI cooperation, as the Justice and Home Affairs pillar by the Maastricht Treaty in order to advance cooperation in criminal and justice fields without member states sacrificing a great deal of sovereignty. Decisions were taken by consensus rather than majority (which was the case in the European Community areas) and the supranational institutions had little input. The Treaty of Amsterdam transferred the areas of illegal immigration, visas, asylum, and judicial co-operation in civil matters to the integrated European Community. The term Justice and Home Affairs later covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar. The pillar was renamed \\"Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters\\" to reflect its reduced scope. Before the Maastricht Treaty, member states cooperated at the intergovernmental level in various sectors relating to free movement and personal security (\\"group of co-ordinators\\", CELAD, TREVI) as well as in customs co-operation (GAM) and judicial policy. With Maastricht, Justice and Home Affairs co-operation aimed at reinforcing actions taken by member states while allowing a more coherent approach of these actions, by offering new tools for coordinating actions. The Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009, abolished the entire pillar system. The PJC areas and those transferred from JHA to the Community were once more grouped together in creating an area of freedom, security and justice. =EU evolution timeline=Responsibilities The Maastricht Treaty established that, while reaching the objectives of the Union, and notably the freedom of movement, the member states consider the following as areas of common interest under Justice and Home Affairs: #Asylum; #Rules concerning the entrance of external borders; #Immigration policies and policies concerning third countries' citizens: #*Conditions of entry and circulation for foreign citizens in the territory of the Union; #*Conditions of residence for foreign citizens in the territory of Member States, comprising families and employment access; #*Fight against irregular immigration, residence and work of foreigners within the territory of the Union; #Combating illicit drugs where this is not covered by point 7), 8) and 9); #Fight against international fraud where this is not covered by points 7), 8) and 9); #Judicial co-operation in civil matters; #Judicial co-operation in penal matters; #Customs co-operation; #Police co-operation for preventing and fighting terrorism, drugs trade and other grave forms of international criminality, comprising, if necessary, certain aspects of customs co-operation. There were three EU agencies under the PJC pillar: Eurojust, Europol and European Police College (Cepol).

The remaining Small Faces‚ÄîIan McLagan (keyboards), Ronnie Lane (bass guitar, vocals), and Kenney Jones (drums and percussion)‚Äîwere joined by Ronnie Wood (guitar) and Rod Stewart (lead vocals), both from the Jeff Beck Group, and the new line-up was renamed Faces. Faces and Small Faces were jointly inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. History The first collaboration among the future Faces was in a formation called Quiet Melon, which also featured Wood's older brother Art Wood and Kim Gardner; they recorded four songs and played a few shows in May 1969, during a break in Ronnie Wood's and Rod Stewart's commitments with The Jeff Beck Group. Later that summer Wood and Stewart parted ways with Beck and joined Lane, McLagan and Jones full-time. Prior to any releases by the new Faces lineup, Wood and McLagan appeared on Stewart's first solo album in 1969, An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down (known as The Rod Stewart Album in the US). The rest of the backing band on the album included drummer Micky Waller, keyboardist Keith Emerson and guitarists Martin Pugh (of Steamhammer, and later Armageddon and 7th Order) and Martin Quittenton (also from Steamhammer). With the addition of Wood and Stewart, the \\"small\\" part of the original band name was dropped, partly because the two newcomers (at 5'9\\" and 5'10\\" respectively) were significantly taller than the three former Small Faces. Hoping to capitalise on the Small Faces' earlier success, record company executives wanted the band to keep their old name; however, the band objected, arguing the personnel changes resulted in a group very different from the Small Faces. As a compromise, in the US their debut album was credited to the Small Faces, while subsequent albums appeared under their new name.see the notes for the Faces' The Definitive Rock Collection, Rhino Records, 2007 The group regularly toured Britain, Europe and the United States from 1970 to 1975, and were among the top-grossing live acts in that period; in 1974 their touring also encompassed Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They toured the United States and Canada in 1975. Among their most successful songs were \\"Had Me a Real Good Time\\", their breakthrough UK hit \\"Stay with Me\\", \\"Cindy Incidentally\\" and \\"Pool Hall Richard\\". As Rod Stewart's solo career became more successful than that of the group, the band became overshadowed by their lead singer. A disillusioned Ronnie Lane left the band in 1973; one reason given later for his departure was frustration over not having more opportunities to sing lead vocals. Lane's role as bassist was taken over by Tetsu Yamauchi (who had replaced Andy Fraser in Free). Released just months before Lane left the band, the Faces' final studio album was Ooh La La. The following year a live album was released, entitled Coast to Coast: Overture and Beginners; it was criticised by reviewers for being poorly recorded and thought out. It featured selections from their late 1973 tour, the first featuring Yamauchi.Liner Notes for \\"Overture and Beginners\\" They recorded a few tracks for another studio album, but had lost enthusiasm and their final release as a group was the late 1974 UK Top 20 hit \\"You Can Make Me Dance, Sing or Anything\\". In 1975 Wood began working with the Rolling Stones, which brought differences between Stewart and the others to a head, and after a troubled fall US tour (with Jesse Ed Davis on rhythm guitar), in December the band announced that they were splitting. =Post-Faces= The members have had varied post-band careers. Wood joined the Rolling Stones and later became a full member with the departure of Mick Taylor, Lane formed Slim Chance and had a modest solo career that ended prematurely when he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and he also worked on an album with Who guitarist Pete Townshend, Rough Mix. Jones joined the Who after the death of Keith Moon; McLagan stated in a 2004 interview that Townshend also asked him to join the Who, but he had already promised Keith Richards that he would tour as a Rolling Stones sideman. McLagan moved to the United States, where he formed Ian McLagan & the Bump Band. Tetsu Yamauchi returned to his native Japan, where he recorded and toured as a jazz musician and Stewart's solo career was extremely successful. There was also a Small Faces reunion in the late 1970s (without Ronnie Lane) that resulted in two albums; and in 1981 Ronnie Lane and Steve Marriott collaborated on the album The Legendary Majik Mijits. Faces reformed for the encore of Rod Stewart's Wembley Stadium concert in 1986. Ronnie Lane, by then suffering from multiple sclerosis, was on stage to sing in his wheelchair, but was unable to play bass; Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones filled in for him. The same line-up reunited once more (minus Lane) in 1993 when Rod Stewart was awarded the Lifetime Achievement award at the Brit Awards. Ronnie Lane made his final concert appearance in 1992 at a Ronnie Wood show with Ian McLagan on keyboards; Lane died in 1997. In 2004 a 4-disc Faces box set entitled Five Guys Walk into a Bar... was released by Rhino Records, featuring many of the band's most popular tracks as well as several previously unreleased songs. Drummer Kenney Jones formed a group called the Jones Gang, together with singer Robert Hart (formerly of Bad Company), Patrick Walford and bassist Rick Wills (formerly of Foreigner); in 2005 their first single \\"Angel\\" reached number 1 on the US Billboard \\"hot singles sales\\" list. During 2004 and early 2005 the surviving Faces had several near-reunions, none of which featured more than three members at the same time: In May 2004 Kenney Jones and Ronnie Wood joined Ian McLagan on stage at his concert at The Mean Fiddler in London. In August 2004 Wood and McLagan joined Stewart at the Hollywood Bowl; Wood also appeared at several other of Stewart's 2004 gigs, including New York's Madison Square Garden, the Royal Albert Hall and a street performance in London for an audience of 80,000. In March 2005 McLagan joined Ronnie Wood's band at a London show, which also featured Kenney Jones on drums for the final encore; and in December 2005 Wood joined Ian McLagan & the Bump Band for three numbers at a concert in Houston, Texas. =Reunion= The band reunited at the Royal Albert Hall, October 2009 On 11 June 2008, Rod Stewart announced that the surviving Faces were discussing a possible reunion, envisioning making a recording and/or performing at least one or two concerts. On 18 November Rod Stewart, Ron Wood, Ian McLagan and Kenney Jones reunited along with Rod Stewart's touring bassist Conrad Korsch for a rehearsal \\"just to check if they can remember the songs\\"; the band's official reunion website was launched earlier the same month. However, on 23 January 2009, a spokesman for Rod Stewart denied there were any plans for a 2009 Faces reunion tour. On 24 September 2009, it was announced that the Faces, minus Rod Stewart, would reunite for a one-off charity show for the Performing Rights Society's Music Members' Benevolent Fund, at the Royal Albert Hall in London. \\"This will be so special for us, staging a reunion for such a wonderful and prestigious event,\\" said Ronnie Wood when the announcement of the concert was made. \\"Sadly Ronnie Lane can't be with us, but I'm sure he will be there in spirit, God bless him.\\" Lane's ex-wife, Katy, is one of many to receive assistance from the charity. The event was held on 25 October. Ronnie Wood, Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan all took part, with various vocalists, including Mick Hucknall, replacing Stewart, and Bill Wyman filling in for the late Ronnie Lane on bass guitar. On 25 May 2010, it was announced that the Faces had officially reformed with Hucknall taking on vocal duties, and Glen Matlock of the Sex Pistols on bass. The band played festival dates in both 2010 and 2011, with dates in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Japan. The Small Faces/Faces were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. On 23 March, the Faces announced that they would reunite with Rod Stewart to play at the induction ceremony for the first time in 19 years. However, on the eve of the ceremony, Stewart bowed out owing to a bout of influenza and Hucknall was asked to sing in his place. In June 2013, speaking in an interview on YouTube, Kenney Jones confirmed the band's intention to reunite with Stewart for a tour in 2014. However, Ian McLagan died on 3 December 2014, putting this reunion in doubt. Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood and Kenney Jones performed a short set at Hurtwood Polo Club on 5 September 2015 for charity, following their brief reunion at Rod Stewart's private party for his 70th birthday in January of that year. The reunion show was critically acclaimed, with The Telegraph newspaper reviewing the performance as \\"5 star,\\" under the headline of \\"worth the 40-year wait.\\" =Influence on music= Although they enjoyed only modest success compared to contemporaries such as the Who and the Rolling Stones, the Faces have had considerable influence on latter-day rock revivalists. Their good-natured, back-to-basics (and frequently liquor-laden) concerts and studio albums connect them with such bands as the Damned and the Sex Pistols. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

Monmouth is a selective, exclusively undergraduate four-year institution that enrolls approximately 1,100 students from 32 countries. Students choose courses from 34 major programs, 39 minors, and 18 pre- professional programs in a core curriculum. History Construction of Wallace Hall, Monmouth College, 1908 Monmouth College was founded on April 18, 1853, by the Second Presbytery of Illinois of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. The college celebrates this date as \\"Scholars Day\\", cancelling classes for a day of celebration and an honors convocation. Founded as \\"Monmouth Academy,\\" the school became Monmouth College after receiving a charter from the state legislature on September 3, 1856. The college remains affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA) and is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, a consortium of small, private liberal arts colleges. The college's motto \\"Lux\\" (\\"Light\\") appears on its seal. The first president, David Wallace built two mission churches in Massachusetts before assuming the Monmouth presidency. Founded on the eve of the American Civil War, the college immediately faced a serious crisis. The college's campus was still under construction while virtually the entire male student body left for military service. Two hundred and thirty-two students, faculty members, and trustees served in the Civil War. A quarter of them were wounded and one in eight was killed. Two were awarded the Medal of Honor, and Abner C. Harding, a college trustee who raised a regiment composed largely of MC students, was commissioned a brigadier general for his leadership in the defense of Fort Donelson in 1863. President Wallace, believing that the college \\"must educate, whether there be peace or war,\\" kept classes in session for what was then a primarily female student body. Monmouth was founded as a coeducational college where women and men had equal access to courses. When veterans returning to the college decided to form fraternities, a group of women was determined not to be outdone, and in 1867 established the first fraternity for women, known today as Pi Beta Phi. Three years later, another well-known women's fraternity, Kappa Kappa Gamma, was founded at Monmouth. Monmouth College had gained national stature by 1911 as shown by its US government classification where 59 colleges and universities ranked higher and 244 ranked lower (out of a total of 345 top colleges). World War II posed a crisis to the institution similar to that of the Civil War, as male students began enlisting in the service within a month of Pearl Harbor, and soon only a handful remained on campus. Through an arrangement with the Navy Department, the college survived by becoming a U.S. Naval Flight Preparatory School, and later offered a V-5 Navy Academic Refresher Unit program for officers. Courses were taught by Monmouth's liberal arts faculty. The Navy later adopted portions of Monmouth's curriculum for training programs nationwide. More than 2,000 Navy men went through Monmouth College, a number of whom would re-enroll at the college after the war funded by the G.I. Bill. Monmouth's chemistry department gained national prominence in the 1950s when longtime professor William S. Haldeman was recognized with a major award by the American Chemical Society. The Steelman Report on Manpower for Research noted that Monmouth and four other small colleges‚ÄîHope, Juniata, St. Olaf and Oberlin‚Äîtogether had \\"produced more candidates for the doctor's degree in chemistry than Johns Hopkins, Fordham, Columbia, Tulane and Syracuse Universities combined.\\" Beginning in the 1960s, a secularization movement changed the nature of the college. Concurrent with dwindling financial support from the United Presbyterian Church, the college removed the Church Synod's role in nominating and confirming trustees, thus opening the door for the cultivation of new trustees with stronger business acumen and financial resources than those during the college's earlier days. The college did otherwise maintain its covenant relationship with the Church. During the Vietnam War, the military draft (and the ability to avoid the draft by enrolling in college) contributed to increases in college attendance throughout the US. Attendance at the college increased but then fell when the draft ended in the 1970s causing financial strain not unlike the losing of students to the Civil War had done in the then distant past. In 1983, a donation from an alumnus committed $5 million to the endowment and launched a $15 million capital campaign, the largest gift in college history to that point.Meyer, Daniel. (2002) A Thousand Hearts‚Äô Devotion: A History of Monmouth College, Monmouth College. pp. 122-147. During the 1990s, enrollment began a steady increase that would see it more than double over the next two decades, from less than 600 in 1993 to 1,379 in 2009. The endowment also grew substantially, from $23.6 million in 1993 to $87.2 million in 2013. Between 2002 and 2013, more than $120 million was invested in new construction and renovations to the campus. =Presidents= 278x278px * The Rev.

Monmouth also continues its relationship with the Presbyterian Church (USA), although courses in religion are no longer required, and is an active member of the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, of which President Mauri Ditzler served as chair in 2011‚Äì2012. Chemistry at Monmouth is an approved baccalaureate program by the American Chemical Society. Academics and resources Dedicated in 2013, Monmouth College's Center for Science and Business =Academic program= Monmouth College offers 34 major fields of study and 18 pre-professional fields of study (with 851 different courses offered) in the sciences, arts, humanities, mathematics, computer sciences, social sciences, foreign languages, classics, and several interdisciplinary fields (including premedical and pre-engineering studies) and provides an unusually integrated core curriculum. This curriculum includes four signature courses designed to aid students in making connections across disciplines and understanding their education as an integrated whole. The curriculum allows freshman students to take advanced classes, and senior students to take introductory courses. For freshmen, the only course requirement mandated by the course registrar is one of the first-year seminar courses called Introduction to Liberal Arts which are usually limited to 16 students (and never more than 18) and shares a common focus on critical analysis and development of written and oral argument. Besides a first-year seminar course, the other 31 courses (usually four are taken per semester) required for graduation can be elected by the students themselves. Nevertheless, to complete their major, students must still adhere to departmental course requirements. Upon entering the college, new students are assigned a faculty advisor. These advisors guide students through the educational process. Each faculty advisor works with a limited number of students to ensure a course of study that has both breadth and depth and is integrated across disciplines while still being intellectually fulfilling. Faculty advising continues for the remainder of each student's education. 16 percent of Monmouth students in the class of 2013 were double majors. A small number of triple majors and interdisciplinary majors also exist. Within five years of graduation, more than 60 percent of Monmouth alumni attend graduate school or another form of ongoing education. A survey taken six months after the class of 2012 had graduated, showed that 99% of Monmouth graduates were employed (or were in graduate school); the 2013 and 2014 surveys also showed 99%. Other concepts integral to the Monmouth College curriculum is the concept of total immersion and the power of the entire college experience to provide transformative development for the student. Accordingly, the college provides extensive out- of-the-classroom opportunities for students to develop and to interact with as many other disciplines as possible. This is reflected in the approximately 120 student organizations and close faculty/student interaction that is a part of the college experience at Monmouth. =Teaching= alt=The entrance of Wallace Hall is modeled after the east portico of the ancient Erechtheum of the Athenian acropolis. The building houses historic classrooms used by all living alumni of Monmouth College. Maintaining a student-to-faculty ratio of 11:1 and an average class size of 13 students, Monmouth places a high priority on meaningful interaction between students and their professors. Eighty-five percent of faculty hold the highest degrees in their fields. With the favorable student-to-faculty ratio, Monmouth classrooms are characterized by face-to-face interaction between professor and student that is, by design, frequent and with great depth. Outside the classroom professors often serve as academic advisers, student organization advisers and mentors. Professors draw students (even first-year students during the summer prior to their enrollment) into independent research or creative work, which results in original scholarly product. Under the mentorship of faculty, many science students participate in sophisticated graduate-level research using state-of- the-art equipment and facilities, and are listed as co-authors on faculty articles that appear in peer-reviewed journals. Students from all disciplines also have the opportunity to submit articles for publication in Monmouth College's Midwest Journal of Undergraduate Research. =Admission= The Carnegie Foundation classifies Monmouth as a selective institution. For the Class of 2017 (enrolled autumn 2013), Monmouth received 2972 applications and accepted 1914 (64.4%). In 2014, 54% of students were female and 46% were male. Students came from 30 states and 35 countries. 25% were students of color and 7% were international students. The transfer admissions process was more selective, with 126 admitted (51.2%) out of 246 applicants for the 2013 autumn semester. The college uses rolling admissions meaning that once the prospective student's application for admission is complete, a decision is usually made by the college within two weeks. =Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium= Monmouth is a founding member of the fourteen-member Associated Colleges of the Midwest (ACM) consortium. The colleges share resources and develop and operate common off-campus academic programs. The members of the ACM include some of the finest colleges and universities in the middle west region of the United States and include top-ranked Carleton College and Grinnell College among others. =Resources and facilities= 300x300px Among the resources on the campus at Monmouth College are dozens of academic and residential buildings, athletic fields and facilities, three wildlife sanctuaries for the study of ecology, and trails and other areas for hiking. Notable resources include the Shields Collection of antiquities, the largest privately held collection of Native American artifacts in the region, the only direct copy of the Canopus Stone outside of the Cairo Museum, an astronomical observatory, the Mellinger writing center, the Wackerle Career and Leadership center, and some of the finest sporting facilities in any Division III school. The Kasch Performance Hall provides an elegant and traditional setting for musical performances with excellent acoustics and includes a recently refurbished three-manual pipe organ. The Wells Theater is located on campus and has been recently upgraded with new high tech lighting and sound equipment. The \\"black box\\" experimental Fusion Theatre is located in downtown Monmouth and opened in 2013. Internet connection is available in all student residences and the entire campus also has unlimited access to wireless internet. There are ten residence halls, an intercultural house, seven Greek houses, and four apartment buildings available for student use. The campus has undergone major expansion in recent years. Bowers Hall, a premium residence hall built in 2001, was the first new dormitory in over 30 years. The college purchased and upgraded an apartment complex near the campus in 2003 and Pattee Hall, built on the north side on the campus, was completed before the Fall of 2005. Gracie Peterson Hall, a modern coed residence hall opened in the fall of 2007. The Peacock Athletic Complex was built in 2000, supplemented by a new tennis complex in 2003. It reopened the completely renovated Dahl Chapel and Auditorium containing a 600-seat English Chapel style recital hall/auditorium as well as music rehearsal space in 2003. In 2008, the April Zorn Memorial Stadium was completed, enlarging the seating capacity for football and track events to 2,600 and adding a state-of-the-art press box. The largest building on campus is the Huff Athletic Center. It encompasses the college's existing Glennie Gymnasium and includes a field house with indoor tennis courts and track, natatorium, fitness complex, wellness suite, locker and training rooms, classrooms and offices. Opened in 2013 is the $40 million, Center for Science and Business, which houses the departments of accounting, biology, chemistry, economics, mathematics & computer science, physics, psychology and political economy & commerce. The new facility introduces a cadaver lab, the Adolphson Observatory with research-grade 20-inch reflecting telescope, nuclear physics lab, two parallel computing facilities, a moot boardroom, tax preparation facilities, one-way observation labs, and an FDA-approved nutrition lab. The college maintains a state-of-the-art digital television studio and media (computer) lab, a web- based radio station, digital classrooms, and three art galleries. The college also maintains the LeSuer Nature Preserve, a nature preserve, the Hamilton Research Pond, a prairie grass laboratory and a riparian property on the banks of the Mississippi river for the purposes of wetland biological research. The Ivory Quinby House,William, Urban.Ivory Quinby, The Burlington Railroad, and Monmouth College built by a founder of Monmouth College, is now the home of the President of the college and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Students regularly attend functions at the home, including dinners and discussion groups. =Sustainability= Monmouth College has reduced its energy consumption and has substantially increased its recycling contributions in recent years. These efforts include energy reduction through the installation of numerous new heating boilers throughout campus, the use of energy-efficient lighting, low-flow water systems and the replacement of windows in nearly all older buildings. The new Center for Science and Business includes energy efficient heating/cooling systems and heat recapture exhaust systems among many other features. Recycling efforts now extend into every student residence and office building. Some students have also committed themselves to sustainability of food production by opting to live in the college's Garden theme housing which grows its own organic food and harvests its own honey using college facilities including seven acres set aside for such use. The college also provides scholarships for students who have demonstrated leadership in sustainability prior to enrolling. The college provides free access to bicycles for student use, and an electric vehicle recharging station is located on campus. =Study abroad and off-campus= Over seventy off-campus programs are available in over fifty countries and may run for as little as ten days or as long as a year but generally last one semester. Programs offered through the Associated Colleges of the Midwest consortium take place usually for one semester at over a dozen locales around the globe and include cultural, scientific, economic, historical and other forms of study and research. The diversity of these programs spans such topics as scientific research at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to government interning in Washington, D.C. to cultural activities in Florence, Italy. Monmouth College faculty frequently teach in these programs along with other members of the consortium including Carleton College, Grinnell College, and eleven other colleges. Other programs run exclusively by Monmouth College include a wide-ranging program in Scotland. In 2012, four Monmouth College students studied at the Fulbright International Summer Institute in Bulgaria, accompanied by a Monmouth College Associate Dean who taught at the Institute. =Hewes Library= Housing about a half million items, the Hewes Library also contains ancient antiquities and thousands of Native American artifacts. With over a half-million items catalogued, the Hewes Library provides students access to its broad collections. Besides books and periodicals and a large interlibrary loan capability, the library also houses collections of antiquities, rare books, art, archaeology, and also computer laboratories and high-tech support. A major remodeling in 2000 has resulted in a modern open- stack facility. =Fellowships and internships= Hundreds of internships are arranged annually for students through the Wackerle Career and Leadership Center. These include public service work around the country. Students have also interned, beginning as early as the first year, opting from opportunities at such businesses as Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Co., Monsanto, law offices, medical offices, and many others. Summer internships are also available at the college in such offices as Admission, Financial Aid, Student Life, Hewes Library, Marketing communication, fundraising and others. Summer research opportunities exist for students and also incoming freshmen and transfers in the sciences and many other areas of study. This research is conducted with professors and students working in groups and includes such varied topics such as lightning research, archaeology and music. Included are allowances for a stipend and room and board expenses. Cost of attendance and financial aid Monmouth's comprehensive tuition, room, and board fees for the 2015‚Äì16 academic year is $42,450. Once miscellaneous personal expenses are factored in the total cost to attend for the 2015‚Äì16 academic year is approximately $45,400. Despite its cost of attendance shown above, Monmouth College provides scholarships or financial aid to over 98% of students. The average financial aid package award for 2014‚Äì15 was $30,090 (of which $4,325 were loans and work study); the average net price of attendance was $10,760. This average is for all freshmen students including those with no financial need. Merit scholarships are automatically offered upon the completion of application to the college. Competitive scholarships in the areas of fine arts, sustainability, Presbyterian, and Latin are determined by an application process in January or February annually. Need-based financial aid is determined by the student filing the FAFSA federal form. These students are encouraged to file this form in January although later filing is accepted. The college maintains a staff of experts who aid students and parents in working through these processes in order to build the best possible financial package. Outside scholarships are accepted with no reduction in Monmouth College aid or scholarships. Students and staff=Students= Students represent about 30 states and about 35 countries.

The observatory was established in 1945 by Bernard Lovell, a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester to investigate cosmic rays after his work on radar during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of meteoroids, quasars, pulsars, masers and gravitational lenses, and was heavily involved with the tracking of space probes at the start of the Space Age. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington. The main telescope at the observatory is the Lovell Telescope. Its diameter of makes it the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the Mark II, and and 7 m diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the University of Manchester on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council. The Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum, are in the civil parish of Lower Withington and the Lovell Telescope and the observatory are in Goostrey civil parish, near Goostrey and Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, North West England. The observatory is reached from the A535. The Crewe to Manchester Line passes right by the site, and Goostrey station is a short distance away. On 7 July 2019, the observatory became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  Early years  Observations at Jodrell Bank in 1945 Jodrell Bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the University of Manchester's Department of Botany purchased three fields from the Leighs. It is named from a nearby rise in the ground, Jodrell Bank, which was named after William Jauderell, whose descendants lived at the mansion that is now Terra Nova School. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from George Massey on which the Lovell Telescope was built.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank The site was first used for astrophysics in 1945, when Bernard Lovell used some equipment left over from World War II, including a gun laying radar, to investigate cosmic rays.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 2 The equipment was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2 m, provided by J. S. Hey.Astronomer by Chance, p. 110Gunn, 2005 He intended to use the equipment in Manchester, but electrical interference from the trams on Oxford Road prevented him from doing so. He moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, south of the city, on 10 December 1945.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 3 Lovell's main research was transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from ionized meteor trails by October 1946.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 9 The first staff were Alf Dean and Frank Foden who observed meteors observed with the naked eye while Lovell observed the electromagnetic signal using equipment. The first time Lovell turned the radar on ‚Äì 14 December 1945 ‚Äì the Geminids meteor shower was at a maximum. Over the next few years, Lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware, including a portable cabin, known as a \\"Park Royal\\" in the military (see Park Royal Vehicles). The first permanent building was near to the cabin and was named after it. Jodrell Bank is primarily used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars.  Searchlight telescope  A searchlight was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the army;Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 10 a broadside array was constructed on its mount by J. Clegg. It consisted of a number of Yagi antennas.Astronomer by Chance, p. 129 It was used for astronomical observations in October 1946.Astronomer by Chance, p. 128 On 9 and 10 October 1946, the telescope observed ionisation in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the Giacobinids meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were from meteors. The telescope was then used to determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it. The telescope and other receivers on the site, studied auroral streamers that were visible in early August 1947.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 15Astronomer by Chance, p. 186  Transit Telescope  The Transit Telescope was a parabolic reflector zenith telescope built in 1947. At the time, it was the world's largest radio telescope. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of scaffold poles, which focussed radio signals on a focal point above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was changed from timber to steel before construction was complete. The telescope was replaced by the steerable Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescope was subsequently built at the same location. The telescope could map a ¬± 15-degree strip around the zenith at 72 and 160 MHz, with a resolution at 160 MHz of 1 degree. (the proposal document for the Lovell Telescope). pp. 4‚Äì5 It discovered radio noise from the Great Nebula in Andromeda‚Äîthe first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source‚Äîand the remains of Tycho's Supernova in the radio frequency; at the time it had not been discovered by optical astronomy.  Lovell Telescope  The Lovell Telescope The \\"Mark I\\" telescope, now known as the Lovell Telescope, was the world's largest steerable dish radio telescope, in diameter, when it was constructed in 1957; it is now the third largest, after the Green Bank telescope in West Virginia and the Effelsberg telescope in Germany. Part of the gun turret mechanisms from the battleships and were reused in the telescope's motor system.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 29 The telescope became operational in mid-1957, in time for the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. The telescope was the only one able to track Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; first locating it just before midnight on 12 October 1957, eight days after launch.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 196Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 262 In the following years, the telescope tracked various space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the United States' NASA-launched Pioneer 5 probe. The telescope sent commands to the probe, including those to separate it from its carrier rocket and turn on its more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It received data from the probe, the only telescope in the world capable of doing so.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. xii, pp. 239‚Äì244 Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 272 In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track its unmanned moon lander Luna 9 and recorded on its facsimile transmission of photographs from the moon's surface. The photographs were sent to the British press and published before the Soviets made them public.Lovell, The Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 250 In 1969, the Soviet Union's Luna 15 was also tracked. A recording of the moment when Jodrell Bank's scientists observed the mission was released on 3 July 2009., includes link to recording with Lovell With the support of Sir Bernard Lovell, the telescope tracked Russian satellites. Satellite and space probe observations were shared with the US Department of Defense satellite tracking research and development activity at Project Space Track. Tracking space probes only took a fraction of the Lovell telescope's observing time and the remainder used for scientific observations including using radar to measure the distance to the moon and to Venus;Lovell, Out of the Zenith, pp. 197‚Äì198Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 277‚Äì280 observations of astrophysical masers around star-forming regions and giant stars; observations of pulsars (including the discovery of millisecond pulsars and the first pulsar in a globular cluster); observations of quasars and gravitational lenses (including the detection of the first gravitational lensLovell, Astronomer by Chance, pp. 297‚Äì301 and the first Einstein ring). The telescope has been used for SETI observations.  Mark II and III telescopes  The Mark II radio telescope The Mark II is an elliptical radio telescope, with a major axis and a minor axis of . It was constructed in 1964. As well as operating as a standalone telescope, it has been used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope, and is now primarily used as part of the MERLIN project. The Mark III telescope, the same size as the Mark II, was constructed to be transportablePalmer and Rowson (1968) but it was never moved from Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966 and decommissioned in 1996.  Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals  A model of the proposed Mark V radio telescope The Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build even larger radio telescopes. The Mark IV proposal was for a diameter standalone telescope, built as a national project. The Mark V proposal was for a moveable telescope. The concept of this proposal was for a telescope on a railway line adjoining Jodrell Bank, but concerns about future levels of interference meant that a site in Wales would have been preferable. Design proposals by Husband and Co and Freeman Fox, who had designed the Parkes Observatory telescope were put forward. The Mark VA was similar to the Mark V but with a smaller dish of and a design using prestressed concrete, similar to the Mark II (the previous two designs more closely resembled the Lovell telescope).Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes None of the proposed telescopes was constructed, although design studies were carried out and scale models were made, partly because of the changing political climate, partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK and it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which overran in terms of cost.  Other single dishes  Undergraduate teaching telescope, with the Lovell telescope in the background A 50 ft (15 m) alt-azimuth dish was constructed in 1964 for astronomical research and to track the Zond 1, Zond 2, Ranger 6 and Ranger 7 space probes and Apollo 11. After an accident that irreparably damaged the 50 ft telescope's surface, it was demolished in 1982 and replaced with a more accurate telescope, the \\"42 ft\\". The 42 ft (12.8 m) dish is mainly used to observe pulsars, and continually monitors the Crab Pulsar. When the 42 ft was installed, a smaller dish, the \\"7 m\\" (actually 6.4 m, or 21 ft, in diameter) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching. The 42 ft and 7 m telescopes were originally used at the Woomera Rocket Testing Range in Australia. The 7 m was originally constructed in 1970 by Marconi Company. A Polar Axis telescope was built in 1962. It had a circular 50 ft (15.2 m) dish on a polar mount,Lovell, Jodrell Bank Telescopes, p. 232 and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It has been decommissioned. An reflecting optical telescope was donated to the observatory in 1951Pullan, A history of the University of Manchester 1951‚Äì73, p. 37 but was not used much, and was donated to the Salford Astronomical Society around 1971.  MERLIN  The Multi- Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) is an array of radio telescopes spread across England and the Welsh borders. The array is run from Jodrell Bank on behalf of the Science and Technology Facilities Council as a National Facility. The array consists of up to seven radio telescopes and includes the Lovell Telescope, the Mark II, Cambridge, Defford, Knockin, Darnhall, and Pickmere (previously known as Tabley). The longest baseline is and MERLIN can operate at frequencies between 151 MHz and 24 GHz. At a wavelength of 6 cm (5 GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 50 milliarcseconds which is comparable to that of the HST at optical wavelengths.  Very Long Baseline Interferometry  Jodrell Bank has been involved with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada.Lovell, Out of the Zenith, pp. 67‚Äì68 The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the European VLBI Network), giving a resolution of around 0.001 arcseconds.  Square Kilometre Array  The SKA headquarters In April 2011, Jodrell Bank was named as the location of the control centre for the planned Square Kilometre Array, or SKA Project Office (SPO). The SKA is planned by a collaboration of 20 countries and when completed, is intended to be the most powerful radio telescope ever built. In April 2015 it was announced that Jodrell Bank would be the permanent home of the SKA headquarters for the period of operation expected for the telescope (over 50 years).  Research  The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, of which the Observatory is a part, is one of the largest astrophysics research groups in the UK. About half of the research of the group is in the area of radio astronomy‚Äîincluding research into pulsars, the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, gravitational lenses, active galaxies and astrophysical masers. The group also carries out research at different wavelengths, looking into star formation and evolution, planetary nebulae and astrochemistry. The first director of Jodrell Bank was Bernard Lovell, who established the observatory in 1945. He was succeeded in 1980 by Sir Francis Graham-Smith, followed by Professor Rod Davies around 1990 and Professor Andrew Lyne in 1999. Professor Phil Diamond took over the role on 1 October 2006, at the time when the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics was formed. Prof Ralph Spencer was Acting Director during 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Prof. Albert Zijlstra became Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. Professor Lucio Piccirillo was the Director of the Observatory from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011. Prof. Simon Garrington is the JBCA Associate Director for the Jodrell Bank Observatory. In 2016, Prof. Michael Garrett was appointed as the inaugural Sir Bernard Lovell chair of Astrophysics and Director of Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. As Director JBCA, Prof. Garrett also has overall responsibility for Jodrell Bank Observatory. In May 2017 Jodrell Bank entered into a partnership with the Breakthrough Listen initiative and will share information with Jodrell Bank's team, who wish to conduct an independent SETI search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-MERLIN array. There is an active development programme researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory has been involved in the construction of several Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, including the Tenerife Experiment, which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the Very Small Array. It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44 GHz receivers for the Planck spacecraft. Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the Parkes Telescope in Australia. Visitor facilities, and events A view of the telescope from the Arboretum New visitor's centre being constructed at Jodrell Bank in March 2011 A visitors' centre opened on 19 April 1971 by the Duke of Devonshire,Lovell, Out of the Zenith attracted around 120,000 visitors per year. It covered the history of Jodrell Bank and had a planetarium and 3D theatre hosting simulated trips to Mars. Asbestos in the visitors' centre buildings led to its demolition in 2003 leaving a remnant of its far end. A marquee was set up in its grounds while a new science centre was planned. The plans were shelved when Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to become the University of Manchester in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year. The Lovell Telescope illuminated during Jodrell Bank Live In October 2010, work on a new visitor centre started and the Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre opened on 11 April 2011. It includes an entrance building, the Planet Pavilion, a Space Pavilion for exhibitions and events, a glass-walled cafe with a view of the Lovell Telescope and an outdoor dining area, an education space, and landscaped gardens including the Galaxy Maze. A large orrery was installed in 2013. It does not, however, include a planetarium, though a small inflatable planetarium dome has been in use on the site in recent years. The visitor centre is open to daily and organises public outreach events, including public lectures, star parties, and \\"ask an astronomer\\" sessions. A path around the Lovell telescope is approximately 20 m from the telescope's outer railway, information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it. The arboretum, created in 1972, houses the UK's national collections of crab apple Malus and mountain ash Sorbus species, and the Heather Society's Calluna collection. The arboretum also has a small scale model of the solar system, the scale is approximately 1:5,000,000,000. At Jodrell Bank, as part of the SpacedOut project, is the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering Britain. On 7 July 2010, it was announced that the observatory was being considered for the 2011 United Kingdom Tentative List for World Heritage Site status. It was announced on 22 March 2011 that it was on the UK government's shortlist. In January 2018, it became the UK's candidate for World Heritage status. In July 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted \\"Jodrell Bank Live\\" ‚Äì a rock concert with bands including The Flaming Lips, British Sea Power, Wave Machines, OK GO and Alice Gold. On 23 July 2012, Elbow performed live at the observatory and filmed a documentary of the event and the facility which was released as a live CD/DVD of the concert. On 31 August 2013, Jodrell Bank hosted a concert performed by the Halle Orchestra to commemorate what would have been Lovell's 100th birthday. As well as a number of operatic performances during the day, the evening Halle performance saw numbers such as themes from Star Trek, Star Wars and Doctor Who among others. The main Lovell telescope was rotated to face the onlooking crowd and used as a huge projection screen showing various animated planetary effects. During the interval the 'screen' was used to show a history of Lovell's work and Jodrell Bank. There is an astronomy podcast from the observatory, named The Jodcast. The BBC television programme Stargazing Live is hosted in the control room of the observatory. The programme has had four series, in January 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014. Since 2016, the observatory hosted Bluedot, a music and science festival, featuring musical acts such as Public Service Broadcasting, The Chemical Brothers, as well as talks by scientists and scientific communicators such as Jim Al-Khalili and Richard Dawkins.  Threat of closure  On 3 March 2008, it was reported that Britain's Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), faced with an ¬£80 million shortfall in its budget, was considering withdrawing its planned ¬£2.7 million annual funding of Jodrell Bank's e-MERLIN project. The project, which aimed to replace the microwave links between Jodrell Bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth fibre- optic cables, greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations, was seen as critical to the survival of the facility. Bernard Lovell said \\"It will be a disaster ‚Ä¶ The fate of the Jodrell Bank telescope is bound up with the fate of e-MERLIN. I don't think the establishment can survive if the e-MERLIN funding is cut\\". On 9 July 2008, it was reported that, following an independent review, STFC had reversed its initial position and would now guarantee funding of ¬£2.5 million annually for three years.  Fictional references  Jodrell Bank has been mentioned in several works of fiction, including Doctor Who (The Tenth Planet, Remembrance of the Daleks, \\"The Poison Sky\\", \\"The Eleventh Hour\\", \\"Spyfall\\") and \\"Birthday Boy\\" by David Baddiel. It was intended to be a filming location for Logopolis (Tom Baker's final Doctor Who serial) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead. It was also mentioned in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyAdams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, p. 30‚Äì31 (as well as The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy film), The Creeping Terror and Meteor. Jodrell Bank also featured heavily in the music video to Electric Light Orchestra's 1983 single Secret Messages. The Prefab Sprout song Technique (from debut album Swoon) opens with the line \\"Her husband works at Jodrell Bank/He's home late in the morning\\". The observatory is the site of several episodes in the novel Boneland, by Alan Garner (2012), and the central character, Colin Whisterfield, is an astrophysicist on its staff. Appraisal Since 13 July 1988 the Lovell Telescope has been designated as a Grade I listed building. On 10 July 2017 the Mark II Telescope was also designated at the same grade.

It first appeared in eight instalments (volumes) in 1871 and 1872. Set in a fictitious English Midland town in 1829‚Äì1832, it follows distinct, intersecting stories with many characters.The Bloomsbury Guide to English Literature, ed. Marion Wynne‚ÄìDavies. New York: Prentice Hall, 1990, p. 719. Carolyn Steedman, \\"Going to Middlemarch: History and the Novel\\", Michigan Quarterly Review XL, No. 3 (Summer 2001). Retrieved 13 April 2013. Issues include the status of women, the nature of marriage, idealism, self-interest, religion, hypocrisy, political reform, and education. Despite comic elements, Middlemarch uses realism to encompass historical events: the 1832 Reform Act, early railways, and the accession of King William IV. It looks at medicine of the time and reactionary views in a settled community facing unwelcome change. Eliot began writing the two pieces that formed the novel in 1869‚Äì1870 and completed it in 1871. Initial reviews were mixed, but it is now seen widely as her best work and one of the great English novels.F. R. Leavis, The Great Tradition. New York: George W. Stewart, 1948. Background George Eliot Middlemarch originates in two unfinished pieces that Eliot worked on during 1869 and 1870: the novel \\"Middlemarch (which focused on the character of Lydgate) and the long story \\"Miss Brooke\\" (which focused on the character of Dorothea). The former piece is first mentioned in her journal on 1 January 1869 as one of the tasks for the coming year. In August she began writing, but progress ceased in the following month amidst a lack of confidence in it and distraction from the illness of George Henry Lewes's son Thornie, who was dying of tuberculosis. (Eliot had been living with Lewes since 1854 as part of an open marriage.) After Thornie's death on 19 October 1869, all work on the novel stopped; it is uncertain at this point whether or not Eliot intended to revive it at a later date. In December she wrote of having begun another story, on a subject that she had considered \\"ever since I began to write fiction.\\" By the end of the month she had written a hundred pages of this story and entitled it \\"Miss Brooke\\". Although a precise date is unknown, the process of incorporating material from \\"Middlemarch into the story she had been working on was ongoing by March 1871. While composing, Eliot compiled a notebook of hundreds of literary quotations, from poets, historians, playwrights, philosophers, and critics in eight different languages.M.a.13‚Äì14, from the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library; . By May 1871, the growing length of the novel had become a concern to Eliot, as it threatened to exceed the three-volume format that was the norm in publishing. The issue was compounded because Eliot's most recent novel, Felix Holt, the Radical (1866) ‚Äîalso set in the same pre-Reform Bill England ‚Äî had not sold well. The publisher John Blackwood, who had made a loss on acquiring the English rights to that novel, was approached by Lewes in his role as Eliot's literary agent. He suggested that the novel be brought out in eight two-monthly parts, borrowing the method used for Victor Hugo's novel Les Mis√©rables. This was an alternative to the monthly issues that had been used for such longer works as Charles Dickens's David Copperfield and William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, and avoided Eliot's objections to the slicing of her novel into small parts. Blackwood agreed, although he feared there would be \\"complaints of a want of the continuous interest in the story\\" due to the independence of each volume. The eight books duly appeared during 1872, the last three instalments being issued monthly. With the deaths of Thackeray and Dickens in 1863 and 1870, respectively, Eliot became \\"recognised as the greatest living English novelist\\" at the time of the novel's final publication. Plot Middlemarch centres on the lives of residents of Middlemarch, a fictitious Midlands town, from 1829 onwards ‚Äì the years up to the 1832 Reform Act. The narrative is variably considered to consist of three or four plots with unequal emphasis: the life of Dorothea Brooke, the career of Tertius Lydgate, the courtship of Mary Garth by Fred Vincy, and the disgrace of Nicholas Bulstrode. The two main plots are those of Dorothea and Lydgate. Each plot occurs concurrently, although Bulstrode's is centred on the later chapters. Dorothea Brooke is a 19-year-old orphan, living with her younger sister, Celia, as a ward of her uncle, Mr Brooke. Dorothea is an especially pious young woman, whose hobby involves the renovation of buildings belonging to the tenant farmers, although her uncle discourages her. Dorothea is courted by Sir James Chettam, a young man close to her own age, but she remains oblivious to him. She is attracted instead to the Rev. Edward Casaubon, who is 45. Dorothea accepts Casaubon's offer of marriage, despite her sister's misgivings. Chettam meanwhile is encouraged to turn his attention to Celia, who has developed an interest in him. Fred and Rosamond Vincy are the eldest children of Middlemarch's town mayor. Having never finished university, Fred is widely seen as a failure and a layabout, but allows himself to coast because he is the presumed heir of his childless uncle Mr Featherstone, a rich, though unpleasant man. Featherstone keeps as a companion a niece of his by marriage, Mary Garth, and although she is considered plain, Fred is in love with her and wants to marry her. Dorothea and Casaubon experience the first tensions in their marriage on their honeymoon in Rome, when Dorothea finds that her husband has no interest in involving her in his intellectual pursuits and no real intention of having his copious notes published, which was her chief reason for marrying him. She meets Will Ladislaw, Casaubon's much younger cousin, whom he supports financially. Ladislaw begins to feel attracted to Dorothea. She remains oblivious, but the two become friendly. Fred becomes deeply in debt and finds himself unable to repay what he owes. Having asked Mr Garth, Mary's father, to co-sign the debt, he now tells Garth he must forfeit it. As a result, Mrs Garth's savings from four years of income, held in reserve for the education of her youngest son, are wiped out, as are Mary's savings. As a result, Mr Garth warns Mary against ever marrying Fred. Fred comes down with an illness, of which he is cured by Dr Tertius Lydgate, a newly arrived doctor in Middlemarch. Lydgate has new ideas about medicine and sanitation and believes doctors should prescribe, but not themselves dispense medicines. This draws ire and criticism of many in the town. He allies himself with Bulstrode, a wealthy, church-going landowner and developer, who wants to build a hospital and clinic that follow Lydgate's philosophy, despite the misgivings of Lydgate's friend, Farebrother, about Bulstrode's integrity. Lydgate also becomes acquainted with Rosamond Vincy, whose beauty and education go together with shallowness and self-absorption. Seeking to make a good match, she decides to marry Lydgate, who comes from a wealthy family, and uses Fred's sickness as an opportunity to get close to the doctor. Lydgate initially views their relationship as pure flirtation and backs away from Rosamond after discovering that the town considers them practically engaged. However, on seeing her a final time, he breaks his resolution and the two become engaged. Casaubon arrives back from Rome about the same time, only to suffer a heart attack. Lydgate, brought in to attend him, tells Dorothea it is difficult to pronounce on the nature of Casaubon's illness and chances of recovery: that he may indeed live about 15 years if he takes it easy and ceases his studies, but it is equally possible the disease may develop rapidly, in which case death will be sudden. Meanwhile as Fred recovers, Mr Featherstone falls ill. He reveals on his deathbedthat he has made two wills and tries to get Mary to help him destroy one. Unwilling to be involved in the business, she refuses, and Featherstone dies with both wills still intact. Featherstone's plan had been for ¬£10,000 to go to Fred Vincy, but his estate and fortune instead go to an illegitimate son of his, Joshua Rigg. Casaubon, in poor health, tries to make Dorothea promise, if he should die, to \\"avoid doing what I should deprecate, and apply yourself to do what I should desire.\\" He dies before she can reply, and she later learns of a provision in his will that, if she marries Ladislaw, she will lose her inheritance. The peculiar nature of Casaubon's will leads to general suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is secretly in love with Dorothea but keeps this to himself, having no desire to involve her in scandal or to cause her to be disinherited. Meanwhile she realises she has romantic feelings for him, but must suppress them. He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke, who is mounting a campaign to run for Parliament on a Reform platform. Lydgate's efforts to please Rosamond soon leave him deeply in debt and he is forced to seek help from Bulstrode. He is partly sustained in this by a friendship with Camden Farebrother. Meanwhile, Fred Vincy's humiliation at being responsible for Caleb Garth's financial setbacks shocks him into reassessing his life. He resolves to train as a land agent under the forgiving Caleb. He asks Farebrother to plead his case to Mary Garth, not realizing that Farebrother is also in love with her. Farebrother does so, thereby sacrificing his own desires for the sake of Mary, whom he realises truly loves Fred and is just waiting for him to find his place in the world. John Raffles, a mysterious man who knows of Bulstrode's shady past, appears in Middlemarch, intending to blackmail him. In his youth, the church-going Bulstrode engaged in questionable financial dealings; his fortune is founded on his marriage to a wealthy, much older widow. The widow's daughter, who should have inherited her mother's fortune, has run away, and Bulstrode locates her but fails to disclose this to the widow, so that he, rather than her daughter, will inherit the fortune. The widow's daughter has a son, who turns out to be Ladislaw. On grasping their connection, Bulstrode is consumed with guilt and offers Ladislaw a large sum of money, which Ladislaw refuses as being tainted. Bulstrode's terror of public exposure as a hypocrite leads him to hasten the death of the mortally sick Raffles, while lending a large sum to Lydgate, whom Bulstrode had previously refused to bail out of debt. However, the story of Bulstrode's misdeeds has already spread. Bulstrode's disgrace engulfs Lydgate, as knowledge of the loan spreads, and he is assumed to be complicit with Bulstrode. Only Dorothea and Farebrother retain any faith in him, but Lydgate and Rosamond are still encouraged to leave Middlemarch by the general opprobrium. Disgraced and reviled, Bulstrode's one consolation is that his wife stands by him as he too faces exile. When Mr Brooke's election campaign collapses, Ladislaw decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea to say his farewell. But Dorothea has fallen in love with one whom she had seen hitherto only as her husband's unfortunate relative. She renounces Casaubon's fortune and shocks her family by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, having been successful in his new career, marries Mary. The \\"Finale\\" details the ultimate fortunes of the main characters. Fred and Mary marry and live contentedly with their three sons. Lydgate operates a successful practice outside Middlemarch and attains a good income, but never finds fulfilment and dies at the age of 50, leaving Rosamond and four children. After he dies, Rosamond marries a wealthy physician. Ladislaw engages in public reform, and Dorothea is content as a wife and mother to their two children. Their son eventually inherits Arthur Brooke's estate. Characters Dorothea Brooke and Will Ladislaw Mary Garth and Fred Vincy Rosamond Vincy and Tertius Lydgate *Dorothea Brooke: An intelligent, wealthy woman with great aspirations, Dorothea avoids displaying her wealth and embarks upon projects such as redesigning cottages for her uncle's tenants. She marries the elderly Reverend Edward Casaubon, with the idealistic idea of helping him in his research, The Key to All Mythologies. However, the marriage was a mistake, as Casaubon fails to take her seriously and resents her youth, enthusiasm and energy. Her requests to assist him make it harder for him to conceal that his research is years out of date. Faced with Casaubon's coldness on their honeymoon, Dorothea becomes friends with his relative, Will Ladislaw. Some years after Casaubon's death she falls in love with Will and marries him. *Tertius Lydgate: An idealistic, talented, but na√Øve young doctor, is relatively poor, but of good birth. He hopes to make big advances in medicine through his research, but ends up in an unhappy marriage with Rosamond Vincy. His attempts to show he is answerable to no man fail, and he eventually has to leave town, sacrificing his high ideals to please his wife. *Rev. Edward Casaubon : A pedantic, selfish, elderly clergyman is so taken up with his scholarly research that his marriage to Dorothea is loveless. His unfinished book, The Key to All Mythologies, is intended as a monument to Christian syncretism, but his research is out of date as he cannot read German. He is aware of this but admits it to no one. *Mary Garth: The plain, kind daughter of Caleb and Susan Garth serves as Mr Featherstone's nurse. She and Fred Vincy were childhood sweethearts, but she will not let him to woo her until he shows himself willing and able to live seriously, practically and sincerely. *Arthur Brooke: The oft-befuddled, none-too-clever uncle of Dorothea and Celia Brooke has a reputation as the worst landlord in the county, but stands for Parliament on a Reform platform. *Celia Brooke: Dorothea's younger sister is a beauty. She is more sensual than Dorothea and does not share her idealism and asceticism. She is only too happy to marry Sir James Chettam when Dorothea rejects him. *Sir James Chettam ‚Äì A neighbouring landowner, he is in love with Dorothea and helps with her plans to improve conditions for the tenants. When she marries Casaubon, he marries Celia Brooke. *Rosamond Vincy: Vain, beautiful and shallow, Rosamond has a high opinion of her own charms and a low opinion of Middlemarch society. She marries Tertius Lydgate, believing he will raise her social standing and keep her comfortable. When her husband meets financial difficulties, she thwarts his efforts to economise, seeing such sacrifices as beneath her and insulting. She cannot bear the idea of losing social status. *Fred Vincy: Rosamond's brother has loved Mary Garth from childhood. His family hopes he will advance socially by becoming a clergyman, but he knows Mary will not marry him if he does. Brought up to expect an inheritance from his uncle, Mr Featherstone, he is a spendthrift, but later changes through his love for Mary and finds by studying under Mary's father a profession that gains Mary's respect. *Will Ladislaw: This young cousin of Mr Casaubon has no property, as his grandmother married a poor Polish musician and was disinherited. He is a man of verve, idealism and talent, but no fixed profession. He is in love with Dorothea, but cannot marry her without her losing Mr Casaubon's property. *Humphrey Cadwallader and Elinor Cadwallader: Neighbours of the Brookes, Mr Cadwallader is a rector and Mrs Cadwallader a pragmatic and talkative woman who comments on local affairs with wry cynicism. She disapproves of Dorothea's marriage and Mr Brooke's parliamentary endeavours. *Walter Vincy and Lucy Vincy: A respectable manufacturing couple, they wish their children to advance socially and are disappointed by Rosamond's and Fred's marriages. Vincy's sister is married to Nicholas Bulstrode. Mrs Vincy was an innkeeper's daughter and her sister the second wife of Mr. Featherstone. *Caleb Garth: Mary Garth's father is a kind, honest, generous surveyor and land agent involved in farm management. He is fond of Fred and eventually takes him under his wing. *Camden Farebrother: A poor, but clever vicar and amateur naturalist, he is a friend of Lydgate and Fred Vincy and loves Mary Garth. His position improves when Dorothea appoints him to a living after Casaubon's death. *Nicholas Bulstrode: A wealthy banker married to Vincy's sister, Harriet, he is a pious Methodist keen to impose his beliefs in Middlemarch society. However, he has a sordid past he is desperate to hide. His religion favours his personal desires and lacks sympathy for others. *Peter Featherstone: An old landlord of Stone Court, he is a self-made man, who has married Caleb Garth's sister. On her death he takes Mrs Vincy's sister as his second wife. *Jane Waule: A widow and Peter Featherstone's sister, she has a son, John. *Mr Hawley: A foul-mouthed businessman, he is an enemy of Bulstrode. *Mr Mawmsey: A grocer *Dr Sprague: A Middlemarch physician *Mr Tyke: A clergyman favoured by Bulstrode *Joshua Rigg Featherstone: Featherstone's illegitimate son, he appears at the reading of Featherstone's will and receives a fortune instead of Fred. He is also the stepson of John Raffles, who comes into town to visit Rigg, but instead reveals Bulstrode's past. His appearance in the novel is crucial to the plot. *John Raffles: Raffles is a braggart and a bully, a humorous scoundrel in the tradition of Sir John Falstaff, and an alcoholic. But unlike Falstaff, Raffles is a truly evil man. He holds the key to Bulstrode's dark past and Lydgate's future. Historical novel The action of Middlemarch takes place \\"between September 1829 and May 1832\\", or 40 years before its publication in 1871‚Äì1872, a gap not so pronounced for it to be regularly labelled as a historical novel. By comparison, Walter Scott's Waverley (1814) ‚Äì often seen as the first major historical novel ‚Äì takes place some 60 years before it appears. Eliot had previously written a more obviously historical novel, Romola (1862‚Äì1863), set in 15th-century Florence. The critics Kathleen Blake and Michael York Mason opine that there has been insufficient attention given to Middlemarch \\"as a historical novel that evokes the past in relation to the present.\\" The critic Rosemary Ashton notes that the lack of attention to this side of the novel may indicate its merits: \\"Middlemarch is that very rare thing, a successful historical novel. In fact, it is so successful that we scarcely think of it in terms of that subgenre of fiction.\\" For its contemporary readers, the present \\"was the passage of the Second Reform Act in 1867\\"; the agitation for the Reform Act of 1832 and its turbulent passage through the two Houses of Parliament, which provide the structure of the novel, would have been seen as the past. Though rarely categorised as a historical novel, Middlemarchs attention to historical detail has been noticed; in an 1873 review, Henry James recognised that Eliot's \\"purpose was to be a generous rural historian\\". Elsewhere, Eliot has been seen to adopt \\"the role of imaginative historian, even scientific investigator in Middlemarch and her narrator as conscious \\"of the historiographical questions involved in writing a social and political history of provincial life.\\" This critic compares the novel to \\"a work of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus\\", who is often described as \\"The Father of History\\". Themes=A Study of Provincial Life= The fictional town of Middlemarch, North Loamshire, is probably based on Coventry, where Eliot had lived before moving to London. Like Coventry, Middlemarch is described as a silk-ribbon manufacturing town. The subtitle ‚Äî \\"A Study of Provincial Life\\" ‚Äî has been seen as significant. One critic views the unity of Middlemarch as achieved through \\"the fusion of the two senses of 'provincial'\\": on the one hand it means geographically \\"all parts of the country except the capital\\"; and on the other, a person who is \\"unsophisticated\\" or \\"narrow-minded\\".The Chambers Dictionary (13th edition), London,: Chambers Harrap, 2014. Carolyn Steedman links Eliot's emphasis on provincialism in Middlemarch to Matthew Arnold's discussion of social class in England in Culture and Anarchy essays, published in 1869, about the time Eliot began working on the stories that became Middlemarch. There Arnold classes British society in terms of Barbarians (aristocrats and landed gentry), Philistines (urban middle class) and Populace (working class). Steedman suggests Middlemarch \\"is a portrait of Philistine Provincialism\\". It is worth noting that Eliot went to London, as her heroine Dorothea does at the end of the book. There Eliot achieved fame way beyond most women of her time, whereas Dorothea takes on the role of nurturing Will and her family. Eliot was rejected by her family once she had settled in her common-law relationship with Lewes, and \\"their profound disapproval prevented her ever going home again.\\" She omitted Coventry from her last visit to the Midlands in 1855. =The \\"Woman Question\\"= Central to Middlemarch is the idea that Dorothea Brooke cannot hope to achieve the heroic stature of a figure like Saint Theresa, for Eliot's heroine lives at the wrong time, \\"amidst the conditions of an imperfect social state, in which great feelings will often take the aspect of error, and great faith the aspect of illusion\\".\\"Finale\\" to Middlemarch Antigone, a figure from Greek mythology best known from Sophocles' play, is given in the \\"Finale\\" as a further example of a heroic woman. The literary critic Kathleen Blake notes Eliot's emphasis on St Theresa's \\"very concrete accomplishment, the reform of a religious order\\", rather than her Christian mysticism. A frequent criticism by feminist critics is that not only is Dorothea less heroic than Saint Theresa and Antigone, but George Eliot herself. In response, Ruth Yeazell and Kathleen Blake chide these critics for \\"expecting literary pictures of a strong woman succeeding in a period [around 1830] that did not make them likely in life\\". Eliot has also been criticised more widely for ending the novel with Dorothea marrying a man, Will Ladislaw, so clearly her inferior. The author Henry James describes Ladislaw as a dilettante and feels he \\"has not the concentrated fervour essential in the man chosen by so nobly strenuous a heroine.\\" =Marriage= Marriage is one of the major themes in Middlemarch. According to George Steiner, \\"both principal plots [those of Dorothea and Lydgate] are case studies of unsuccessful marriage\\". This suggests that these \\"disastrous marriages\\" leave the lives of Dorothea and Lydgate unfulfilled. This is arguably more the case with Lydgate than with Dorothea, who gains a second chance through her later marriage to Will Ladislaw, but a favourable interpretation of this marriage depends on the character of Ladislaw himself, whom numerous critics have viewed as Dorothea's inferior. In addition, there is the \\"meaningless and blissful\\" marriage of Dorothea's sister Celia Brooke to Sir James Chettam, and more significantly Fred Vincy's courting of Mary Garth. In the latter, Mary Garth will not accept Fred until he abandons the Church and settles on a more suitable career. Here Fred resembles Henry Fielding's character Tom Jones, both being moulded into a good husband by the love they give to and receive from a woman. Dorothea is a St Theresa, born in the wrong century, in provincial Middlemarch, who mistakes in her idealistic ardor, \\"a poor dry mummified pedant... as a sort of angel of vocation\\". Middlemarch is in part a Bildungsroman focusing on the psychological or moral growth of the protagonist: Dorothea \\"blindly gropes forward, making mistakes in her sometimes foolish, often egotistical, but also admirably idealistic attempt to find a role\\" or vocation that fulfils her nature. Lydgate is equally mistaken in his choice of a partner, as his idea of a perfect wife is someone \\"who can sing and play the piano and provide a soft cushion for her husband to rest after work\\". So he marries Rosamond Vincy, \\"the woman in the novel who most contrasts with Dorothea\\", and thereby \\"deteriorates from ardent researcher to fashionable doctor in London.\\" Critical reception=Contemporary reviews= The Examiner, The Spectator and Athenaeum reviewed each of the eight books that comprise Middlemarch as they were published from December 1871 to December 1872; such reviews speculated on the eventual direction of the plot and responded accordingly. Contemporary response to the novel was mixed. Writing as it was being published, the Spectator reviewer R. H. Hutton criticised it for what he saw as its melancholic quality.H. R. Hutton, \\"Review of Middlemarch\\", Spectator, 1 June 1872. Athenaeum, reviewing it after \\"serialisation\\", found the work overwrought and thought it would have benefited from hastier composition.Athenaeum, 7 December 1872. Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine reviewer W. L. Collins saw as the work's most forceful impression its ability to make readers sympathise with the characters.W. L. Collins, Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, December 1872. Edith Simcox of Academy offered high praises, hailing it as a landmark in fiction owing to the originality of its form; she rated it first amongst Eliot's ≈ìuvre, which meant it \\"has scarcely a superior and very few equals in the whole wide range of English fiction\\". (Reprinted from Swinden, Patrick, ed. [1972], pp. 41‚Äì47). The author Henry James presented a mixed opinion Middlemarch was \\"at once one of the strongest and one of the weakest of English novels\\". His greatest criticism (\\"the only eminent failure in the book\\") was of the character of Ladislaw, whom he felt was an insubstantial hero-figure as against Lydgate. The scenes between Lydgate and Rosamond he especially praised for their psychological depth ‚Äì he doubted whether there were any scenes \\"more powerfully real... [or] intelligent\\" in all English fiction. Th√©r√®se Bentzon, for the Revue des deux Mondes, was critical of Middlemarch. Although finding merit in certain scenes and qualities, she faulted its structure as \\"made up of a succession of unconnected chapters, following each other at random.... The final effect is one of an incoherence which nothing can justify.\\" In her view, Eliot's prioritisation of \\"observation rather than imagination... inexorable analysis rather than sensibility, passion or fantasy\\" means that she should not be held amongst the first ranks of novelists. (Reprinted from Swinden, Patrick, ed. [1972], pp. 56‚Äì60). The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who read Middlemarch in a translation owned by his mother and sister, derided the novel for construing suffering as a means of expiating the debt of sin, which he found characteristic of \\"little moralistic females √† la Eliot.\\"Thomas J. Joudrey. \\"The Defects of Perfectionism: Nietzsche, Eliot, and the Irrevocability of Wrong.\\" Philological Quarterly 96.1 (2017), pp. 77‚Äì104. Despite the divided contemporary response, Middlemarch gained immediate admirers: in 1873, the poet Emily Dickinson expressed high praise for the novel, exclaiming in a letter to a friend: \\"What do I think of Middlemarch? What do I think of glory.\\"Megan Armknecht. \\"The Weight of 'Glory': Emily Dickinson, George Eliot, and Women's Issues in Middlemarch.\\" Criterion 9.1 (2016): 35‚Äì46.Eleanor Elson Heginbotham. \\"'What do I think of glory ‚Äì': Dickinson's Eliot and Middlemarch.\\" Emily Dickinson Journal 21.2 (2012): 20‚Äì36. In separate centuries, Florence Nightingale and Kate Millett remarked on the eventual subordination of Dorothea's own dreams to those of her admirer, Ladislaw.Millet (1972), Sexual Politics; Nightingale quoted in The Cambridge Companion to George Eliot, \\"George Eliot and Gender\\", Kate Flint, 2001. Indeed, the ending acknowledges this and mentions how unfavourable social conditions prevented her from fulfilling her potential. =Later responses= In the first half of the 20th century, Middlemarch continued to provoke contrasting responses; while Leslie Stephen dismissed the novel in 1902, his daughter Virginia Woolf described it in 1919 as \\"the magnificent book that, with all its imperfections, is one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.\\"Virginia Woolf, The Common Reader, 1925, p. 175. However, Woolf was \\"virtually unique\\" among the modernists in her unstinting praise for Middlemarch, and the novel also remained overlooked by the reading public of the time. F. R. Leavis's The Great Tradition (1948) is credited with having \\"rediscovered\\" the novel,: :::The necessary part of great intellectual powers in such a success as Middlemarch is obvious... the sheer informedness about society, its mechanisms, the ways in which people of different classes live... a novelist whose genius manifests itself in a profound analysis of the individual.F. R. Leavis, The Great Tradition. New York: George W. Stewart, 1948, p. 61 Leavis' appraisal of it has been hailed as the beginning of a critical consensus that still exists towards the novel, in which it is recognised not only as Eliot's finest work, but as one of the greatest novels in English. V. S. Pritchett, in The Living Novel, two years earlier, in 1946 had written that \\"No Victorian novel approaches Middlemarch in its width of reference, its intellectual power, or the imperturbable spaciousness of its narrative.... I doubt if any Victorian novelist has as much to teach the modern novelists as George Eliot.... No writer has ever represented the ambiguities of moral choice so fully\\".Quoted in Karen Chase, George Eliot, Middlemarch, p. 94. In the 21st century, the novel is still held in high regard. The novelists Martin Amis and Julian Barnes have both called it probably the greatest novel in the English language,\\"Julian Barnes, The Art of Fiction\\" Interviewed by Shusha Guppy The Paris Review, No. 165:  accessdate = 12 April 2015  and today Middlemarch is frequently included in university courses. In 2013, the then British Education Secretary Michael Gove referred to Middlemarch in a speech, suggesting its superiority to Stephenie Meyer's vampire novel Twilight. Gove's comments led to debate on teaching Middlemarch in Britain, including the question of when novels like Middlemarch should be read, and the role of canonical texts in teaching. The novel has remained a favourite with readers and scores high in reader rankings: in 2003 it was No. 27 in the BBC's The Big Read,\\"BBC ‚Äì The Big Read\\". BBC. April 2003, Retrieved 28 October 2012 and in 2007 it was No. 10 in \\"The 10 Greatest Books of All Time\\", based on a ballot of 125 selected writers. In 2015, in a BBC Culture poll of book critics outside the UK, the novel was ranked at number one in \\"The 100 greatest British novels\\". On 5 November 2019, the BBC News reported that Middlemarch is on the BBC list of 100 \\"most inspiring\\" novels. Legacy and adaptations Middlemarch has been adapted several times for television and the stage. In 1968 it appeared as a BBC-produced TV mini-series of the same name, directed by Joan Craft, starring Michele Dotrice. In 1994 it was again adapted by the BBC as a television series of the same name, directed by Anthony Page with a screenplay by Andrew Davies. This was a critical and financial success and revived public interest adaptating the classics. In 2013 came a stage adaptation, and also an Orange Tree Theatre Repertory production adapted and directed by Geoffrey Beevers as three plays: Dorothea's Story, The Doctor's Story, and Fred & Mary. The novel has never been made into a film, although the idea was toyed with by the English director Sam Mendes. The opera Middlemarch in Spring by Allen Shearer, to a libretto by Claudia Stevens, has a cast of six and treats only the central story of Dorothea Brooke. It was first staged in San Francisco in 2015. In 2017, a modern adaptation, Middlemarch: The Series, aired on YouTube as a video blog. Lyrics for the song \\"How Soon Is Now?\\" by The Smiths were taken from Middlemarch (\\"I am the son and heir, of nothing in particular\\").

Stoney which was used to educate midwives in the Southern United States and promote greater cooperation between midwifery and the modern health system. It was produced by the Georgia Department of Public Health. The film follows Mary Francis Hill Coley (1900‚Äì66) an African American midwife from Albany, Georgia who helped deliver over 3,000 babies in the middle part of the 20th century. On December 17, 2002, it was announced by Librarian of Congress James H. Billington that \\"All My Babies, George Stoney's landmark educational film used to educate midwives in Georgia and throughout the South\\" was among the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry.  Plot  The film was produced as a method of educating \\"granny midwives,\\" the term applied to African-American lay women who delivered the majority of both black and white women's babies in the rural south, and their patients. The film stresses the need for midwives to maintain scrupulous standards of sterility. This lecture comes from a doctor who is explaining the cause of a recent infant death. The second message concerns the necessity of prenatal care and here Coley, or \\"Miss Mary\\" as she's referred to in the film, functions as the expert. The film follows her through two births, the first of which focuses on a woman who has had several successful deliveries, while the other woman has had two miscarriages due to lack of prenatal care. Under Coley's careful guidance and tutelage, both women achieve successful pregnancies and home births. Films such as All My Babies represent part of the transition to State legal oversights and eventual elimination of lay midwifery (also called direct-entry midwifery) in many States.  Production  All My Babies was written produced and directed by documentary filmmaker, George C. Stoney, and is one of his earliest and most widely recognized. Stoney was interested in the subject as a child watching the midwives go about their work in odd hours and later as a Southern field representative who gave midwives lifts and learning more about their work. He first worked with the Georgia Department of Public Health writing and directing Palmour Street, a documentary about mental health in black families. Due to its success the Georgia Department of Public Health determined he was qualified to direct a film on midwives and was initially granted $20,000. The final production cost was $45,000 and filming took place between August 1951 and fall 1952. Stoney partnered local African American Dr. William Mason to gain the trust of the black community while Stoney, with backing from the health department, worked on gaining trust from the white community. To gain their trust, Stoney assured the white community that the film would not suggest an unhappy relationship between blacks and whites existed and worked with the local press to publish favorable articles. Stoney also gained the support of progressive black pastor, Bishop Noah, who preached to the Church of the Kingdom of God, and where Mary Coley attended, not to be afraid of white people. Coley and the congregation therefore welcomed both blacks and whites, including the all-white film crew, and weren't overly suspicious due to Bishop Noah's direction. While the white film crew and cast had a good working relationship, the film's production wasn't devoid of segregation or bias (racial and North-South) between the white community and cast and the crew and black cast. The southern medical establishment was also uneasy with the film's glorification of the midwife's role in the community. Prior to filming, Stoney followed Coley at her appointments to do field research having learnt from Palmour Street that it is important to meet the black community where it was at to create an authentic film and not solely rely on information from experts and books. Coley advised on the film as well, helping to plan and structure the film's scenes so they were more realistic to her work. While some scenes were scripted, the film is notable for featuring a 15-minute real-time sequence of a live birth, a technique pioneered by filmmakers Pare Lorentz and Robert Flaherty. The live birth scene is silent with narratives of the doctors, Coley, and the chorus creating the joyous music with the babies cries upon birth being the emphasis. The score, written by Louis Applebaum and performed by the Musical Art Chorus in Washington, D.C., gives the film a sense of joy during childbirth. Coley also sings throughout the film as she cares for mothers.  Reception  The film met some criticism with the public due to the graphic nature of the birth scene, but was still shown to avant-garde audiences in New York at Cinema 16 and the inaugural Flaherty Film Seminar in 1953. It met all the requirements of the Health Department for safe birthing and was officially sanctioned for medical audiences due to the birth scene. This meant it could only be shown at private screenings, which included the New York locations, where it would not be fined or censored. Stoney also encouraged the restriction desiring to protect the film's subjects and legitimatize the film as a teaching tool. The film was distributed by UNESCO, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, to various other countries, and become widely used in medical school curriculum. The film was also used to promote respect of midwives by doctors and the medical establishment, particularly in countries where the film was demonstrated the United States' medical establishment wasn't afraid to work with midwives. However, the Georgia Department of Public Health provided an accompanying pamphlet with the film stating that the medical profession was not endorsing midwives, seeing them as a \\"temporary and unfortunate necessity.\\"  Preservation  In 2002, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film is the subject of a short 2006 article by Christine Dell'Amore. No free access online.

The film starts in 1946, five years after the book was published. It tells the story of Alec Ramsey, who is shipwrecked on a deserted island with a wild Arabian stallion whom he befriends. After being rescued, they are set on entering a race challenging two champion horses. The film is adapted by Melissa Mathison, Jeanne Rosenberg and William D. Wittliff. It is directed by Carroll Ballard. The film stars Kelly Reno, Teri Garr, Hoyt Axton, Mickey Rooney, and the Arabian horse Cass Ole. The film features music by Carmine Coppola, the father of Hollywood producer Francis Ford Coppola, who was the executive producer of the film. In 2002, The Black Stallion was included in the annual selection of 25 motion pictures to be added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In the summer of 1946, Alec Ramsey is travelling by steamer off the coast of North Africa, where he sees a wild black stallion being forced into a makeshift stable and heavily restrained by ropes leading to his halter. Captivated by the horse, Alec later sneaks to the horse to feed him some sugar cubes, but he is caught by the horse's supposed owner, who tells him in Arabic to stay away from Shetan and shoves the boy away. Later in his bunk, Alec's father shows Alec his winnings from a card game and gives him a pocket knife and a small statue of Bucephalus, and tells the story of how Alexander the Great became Bucephalus' master. Later that night, Alec is thrown out of his bunk; the ship has caught fire and begun to sink. In the chaos, Alec grabs his knife and makes his way to the black stallion and manages to free him. The stallion then jumps into the sea. Alec himself is thrown overboard by the waves. In the water, he swims toward the stallion and managed to grab hold of the ropes of the stallion's restraints just as the ship explodes, rendering him unconscious. Alec wakes on the shore of a deserted island and starts to explore. He finds the stallion caught in his restraints with the ropes stuck between the rocks. With his knife, Alec manages to free the stallion once again and the stallion runs away. For a time, the two keep their distance. Alec discovers means to survive by catching fish and seaweed. As Alec suddenly faces a cobra eye to eye, the Black comes to the rescue and kills the snake, only to run off again. By now, Alec decides to try to get closer to the horse and offer him some seaweed. The hungry stallion finds himself unable to resist, but visibly struggles with his distrust for humans. Eventually, the hunger wins and he takes Alec's offer; their bond has been sealed and the two are now inseparable. Alec even manages to ride the unbroken horse, after many times falling off the horse. One day, a fishing ship arrives, rescuing both Alec and the stallion. Back home in America, Alec is given a hero's welcome. The Black has a temporary home in Alec's back yard, but a garbage man not knowing that there is a wild horse in the back yard is chased by the Black, who races off down the street after being spooked by a passing car. Alec chases after him through every part of town, but loses track of him. The next day, Alec meets Snoe (and Napoleon) who tell him where the Black is. Alec finds the stallion in the barn of Henry Dailey, a retired racehorse jockey, who apparently spent all night catching the Black. Alec arranges for the Black to stay at the barn. When Alec wonders how fast the Black is, Alec and Henry decide to train the Black for the racetrack, while Henry teaches Alec how to be a jockey. The Black surprises Henry with his speed. Henry immediately starts plotting a plan to get the Black into the match race between the country's current two champions. To do that, he sets up a secret demonstration at night where the press can witness his speed, keeping the identity of Alec and the Black secret. The news spreads about the mystery horse and the Black is entered into the race. The race is the most anticipated horseracing event of the year. Before the two champions and the Black enter the starting gate, the Black gets into a fight with one of his opponents, wounding his leg. Alec does not see the wound until he is in the gate. As he dismounts, the bell rings and the horses take off. Alec desperately tries to stay on his horse and trying to stop him. He falls behind, but the Black won't stop. When Alec regains his balance, the Black is well on his way to catch up with his opponents. Alec now encourages the Black to run as fast as he can, remembering the wild rides on the island, as they catch up. The Black eventually wins by two lengths.

Fae Jur's main scene is the one where Alec is trying to gain the trust of the Black on the beach. Two other stunt doubles were used for running, fighting and swimming scenes. El Mokhtar, an Egyptian Arabian racehorse, was the producers' first choice to portray the Black, but they were unable to secure his services for the film from his owners, who declined any offers. He does appear in The Black Stallion Returns, alongside Cass Ole, by which time the studio bought out the syndicate of owners in order to secure El Mokhtar's services. Napoleon was portrayed by Junior, who previously appeared in National Lampoon's Animal House as Trooper, Niedermeyer's horse.

Kinescope , shortened to kine , also known as telerecording in Britain, is a recording of a television program on motion picture film, directly through a lens focused on the screen of a video monitor. The process was pioneered during the 1940s for the preservation, re-broadcasting and sale of television programmes before the introduction of videotape, which from 1956 eventually superseded the use of kinescopes for all of these purposes. Kinescopes were the only practical way to preserve live television broadcasts prior to videotape. Typically, the term Kinescope can refer to the process itself, the equipment used for the procedure (a 16 mm or 35 mm movie camera mounted in front of a video monitor, and synchronized to the monitor's scanning rate), or a film made using the process. The term originally referred to the cathode ray tube used in television receivers, as named by inventor Vladimir K. Zworykin in 1929.Albert Abramson, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 84. . Hence, the recordings were known in full as kinescope films or kinescope recordings.Popular Mechanics April 1953 Page 227Audio Engineering Society, Inc. Retrieved October 29, 2015 RCA was granted a trademark for the term (for its cathode ray tube) in 1932; it voluntarily released the term to the public domain in 1950.\\"RCA Surrenders Rights to Four Trade-Marks,\\" Radio Age, October 1950, p. 21. Film recorders are similar, but record source material from a computer system. Whereas a kinescope records television to film, a telecine is used to play film back on television.  History  The General Electric laboratories in Schenectady, New York experimented with making still and motion picture records of television images in 1931.\\"Schenectady-to-Leipzig Television a Success; Movie Also Made of Images Sent by Radio\\", The New York Times, Feb. 13, 1931, p. 15. There is some evidence to suggest that the BBC experimented with filming the output of the television monitor before its television service was suspended in 1939 due to the outbreak of World War II. A BBC executive, Cecil Madden, later recalled filming a production of The Scarlet Pimpernel in this way, only for film director Alexander Korda to order the burning of the negative as he owned the film rights to the book, which he felt had been infringed. However, the evidence for this is purely anecdotal, and indeed there is no written record of any BBC Television production of The Scarlet Pimpernel during the 1936‚Äì1939 period. The incident is, however, dramatised in Jack Rosenthal's 1986 television play The Fools on the Hill. Some of the surviving live transmissions of the Nazi German television station Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, dating as far back as the 1930s, were recorded by pointing a 35mm camera to a receiver's screen, although most surviving Nazi live television programs such as the 1936 Summer Olympics (not to confuse with the cinematic footage made during the same event by Leni Riefenstahl for her film Olympia), a number of Nuremberg Rallies, or official state visits (such as Benito Mussolini's) were shot directly on 35mm instead and transmitted over the air as a television signal, with only a two minutes' delay from the original event, by means of the so-called Zwischenfilmverfahren (see intermediate film system) from an early outside broadcast van on the site. According to a 1949 film produced by RCA, silent films had been made of early experimental telecasts during the 1930s. The films were produced by aiming a camera at television monitors ‚Äì at a speed of eight frames per second, resulting in somewhat jerky reproductions of the images. By the mid-1940s, RCA and NBC were refining the filming process and including sound; the images were less jerky but still somewhat fuzzy. By early 1946, television cameras were being attached to American guided missiles to aid in their remote steering.James L. H. Peck, \\"Doom on the Wing\\", Popular Science, February 1946, p. 84, 86.Transatlantic Roller Coaster Designed to Bomb U.S.A., Popular Science, October 1947, p. 111. Films were made of the television images they transmitted for further evaluation of the target and the missile's performance.Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland, 2003, p. 9. . The first known surviving example of the telerecording process in Britain is from October 1947, showing the singer Adelaide Hall performing at the RadiOlympia event..Getty Images: A view of the \\"Cafe Continental\\" stage set in the television studio at RadiOlympia Theatre, London, September 1947. Hall sings \\"Chi-Baba, Chi-Baba (My Bambino Go to Sleep)\\" and \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\", as well as accompanying herself on ukulele and dancing. When the show was originally broadcast on BBC TV it was 60 minutes in length and also included performances from Winifred Atwell, Evelyn Dove, Cyril Blake and his Calypso Band, Edric Connor and Mable Lee, and was produced by Eric Fawcett. The six-minute footage of Miss Hall is all that survives of the show. From the following month, the wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip also survives, as do various early 1950s productions such as It is Midnight, Dr Schweitzer, The Lady from the Sea and the opening two episodes of The Quatermass Experiment, although in varying degrees of quality. A complete 7-hour set of telerecordings of Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation also exists. = Worldwide program distribution = In the era before satellite communications, kinescopes were used to distribute live events such as a royal wedding as quickly as possible to other countries of the Commonwealth that had started a television service. A Royal Air Force aircraft would fly the telerecording from the UK to Canada, where it would be broadcast over the whole North American network. Even after the introduction of videotape, the BBC and the ITV companies made black and white kinescopes of selected programs for international sales, and continued to do so until the early 1970s by which time programs were being videotaped in colour. Most, if not all, videotapes from the 405-line era have long since been wiped as have many from the introduction of 625-line video to the early days of colour. Consequently, the majority of British shows that still exist before the introduction of colour, and a number thereafter, do so in the form of these telerecordings. A handful of shows, including some episodes of Doctor Who and most of the first series of Adam Adamant Lives!, were deliberately telerecorded for ease of editing rather than being videotaped. = Eastman Television Recording Camera = In September 1947, Eastman Kodak introduced the Eastman Television Recording Camera, in cooperation with DuMont Laboratories, Inc. and NBC, for recording images from a television screen under the trademark \\"Kinephoto\\". Prior to the introduction of videotape in 1956, kinescopes were the only way to record television broadcasts, or to distribute network television programs that were broadcast live from New York or other originating cities, to stations not connected to the network, or to stations that wished to show a program at a time different than the network broadcast. Although the quality was less than desirable, television programs of all types from prestigious dramas to regular news shows were handled in this manner. NBC, CBS, and DuMont set up their main kinescope recording facilities in New York City, while ABC chose Chicago. By 1951, NBC and CBS were each shipping out some 1,000 16mm kinescope prints each week to their affiliates across the United States, and by 1955 that number had increased to 2,500 per week for CBS.Wesley S. Griswold, \\"Why TV Is Going Movie-Mad\\", Popular Science, February 1955, p. 118. By 1954 the television industry's film consumption surpassed that of all of the Hollywood studios combined.Wolpin, Stewart. \\"The Race to Video \\". Invention & Technology, Fall 1994. = \\"Hot kinescope\\" = After the network of coaxial cable and microwave relays carrying programs to the West Coast was completed in September 1951,\\"Coast to Coast\\", Time, August 13, 1951. CBS and NBC instituted a \\"hot kinescope\\" process in 1952, where shows being performed in New York were transmitted west, filmed on two kinescope machines in 35 mm negative and 16 mm reversal film (the latter for backup protection) in Los Angeles, rushed to film processing, and then transmitted from Los Angeles three hours later for broadcast in the Pacific Time Zone.Arthur Schneider, Jump Cut!: Memoirs of a Pioneer Television Editor, McFarland, 1997, p. 23‚Äì32. . To save the time to make a print, the 35 mm negative was broadcast, and electronically converted to a positive image. The soundtrack for the 35 mm film was recorded on a separate 16 mm filmstrip, and synchronized at playback. The soundtrack for the 16 mm reversal film version was recorded on the same filmstrip as the image.Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland, 2003, p. 48. . In September 1956, NBC began making color \\"hot kines\\" of some of its color programs using a lenticular film process which, unlike color negative film, could be processed rapidly using standard black-and-white methods.Showcase Productions, Inc.: Producers' Showcase, Technical Considerations.Abramson, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, p. 67. = Double system editing = Even after the introduction of Quadruplex videotape machines in 1956 removed the need for \\"hot kines\\", the television networks continued to use kinescopes in the \\"double system\\" method of videotape editing. It was impossible to slow or freeze frame a videotape at that time, so the unedited tape would be copied to a kinescope, and edited conventionally. The edited kinescope print was then used to conform the videotape master. More than 300 videotaped network series and specials used this method over a 12-year period, including the fast-paced Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In.Arthur Schneider, Jump Cut!: Memoirs of a Pioneer Television Editor, McFarland, 1997, p. 105‚Äì106, 134‚Äì135. .  Alternatives to kinescoping  With the variable quality of Kinescopes, networks looked towards alternative methods to replace them with a higher degree of quality. = Change to 35 mm film broadcasts = Programs originally shot with film cameras (as opposed to kinescopes) were also used in television's early years, although they were generally considered inferior to the big-production \\"live\\" programs because of their lower budgets and loss of immediacy. In 1951, the stars and producers of the Hollywood-based television series I Love Lucy, Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball, decided to film the show directly onto 35 mm film using the three-camera system, instead of broadcasting it live. Normally, a live program originating from Los Angeles would be performed live in the late afternoon for the Eastern Time Zone, and seen on a kinescope three hours later in the Pacific Time Zone. But as an article in American Cinematographer explained, :In the beginning there was a very definite reason for the decision of Desilu Productions to put I Love Lucy on film instead of doing it live and having kinescope recordings carry it to affiliate outlets of the network. The company was not satisfied with the quality of kinescopes. It saw that film, produced especially for television, was the only means of ensuring top quality pictures on the home receiver as well as ensuring a flawless show.Leigh Allen, \\"Filming the 'I Love Lucy' Show\\", American Cinematographer, January 1952. The I Love Lucy decision introduced reruns to most of the American television audience, and set a pattern for the syndication of TV shows after their network runs (and later, for first-run airings via syndication). = Electronicam = The program director of the DuMont Television Network, James L. Caddigan, devised an alternative ‚Äî the Electronicam. In this, all the studio TV cameras had built- in 35 mm film cameras which shared the same optical path. An Electronicam technician threw switches to mark the film footage electronically, identifying the camera \\"takes\\" called by the director. The corresponding film segments from the various cameras then were combined by a film editor to duplicate the live program. The \\"Classic 39\\" syndicated episodes of The Honeymooners were filmed using Electronicam (as well as the daily five-minute syndicated series Les Paul & Mary Ford At Home in 1954‚Äì55), but with the introduction of a practical videotape recorder only one year away, the Electronicam system never saw widespread use. The DuMont network did not survive into the era of videotape, and in order to gain clearances for its programs, was heavily dependent on kinescopes, which it called Teletranscriptions. =Electronovision= Attempts were made for many years to take television images, convert them to film via kinescope, then project them in theaters for paying audiences. In the mid-1960s, Producer/entrepreneur H. William \\"Bill\\" Sargent, Jr. used conventional analog Image Orthicon video camera tube units, shooting in the B&W; 819-line interlaced 25fps French video standard, using modified high-band quadruplex VTRs to record the signal. The promoters of Electronovision (not to be confused with Electronicam) gave the impression that this was a new system created from scratch, using a high-tech name (and avoiding the word kinescope) to distinguish the process from conventional film photography. Nonetheless, the advances in picture quality were, at the time, a major step ahead. By capturing more than 800 lines of resolution at 25 frame/s, raw tape could be converted to film via kinescope recording with sufficient enhanced resolution to allow big-screen enlargement. The 1960s productions used Marconi image orthicon video cameras, which have a characteristic white \\"glow\\" around black objects (and a corresponding black glow around white objects), which was a defect of the pickup. Later vidicon and plumbicon video camera tubes produced much cleaner, more accurate pictures. = Videotape = In 1951, singer Bing Crosby‚Äôs company Bing Crosby Enterprises made the first experimental magnetic video recordings; however, the poor picture quality and very high tape speed meant it would be impractical to use. In 1956, Ampex introduced the first commercial Quadruplex videotape recorder, followed in 1958 by a color model. Offering high quality and instant playback at a much lower cost, Quadruplex tape quickly replaced kinescope as the primary means of recording television broadcasts.  Decline  U.S. television networks continued to make kinescopes of their daytime dramas available (many of which still aired live into the late 1960s) as late as 1969 for their smaller network affiliates that did not yet have videotape capability but wished to time-shift the network programming. Some of these programs aired up to two weeks after their original dates, particularly in Alaska and Hawaii. Many episodes of programs from the 1960s survive only through kinescoped copies. The last 16 mm kinescopes of television programs ended in the late 1970s, as video tape recorders became more affordable. In Australia, kinescopes were still being made of some evening news programs as late as 1977, if they were recorded at all. A recording of a 1975 episode of Australian series This Day Tonight is listed on the National Archives of Australia website as a kinescope, while surviving episodes of the 1978 drama series The Truckies also exist as kinescopes, indicating that the technology was still being used by ABC at that point. In later years, film and television producers were often reluctant to include kinescope footage in anthologies because of its inherent inferior quality. While it is true that kinescopes did look inferior to live transmissions in the 1950s, it was due to the industry's technical limitations at that time. Even the best live transmission could look hazy by the time it reached the home viewer. Advances in broadcast technology soon allowed for a wider gray scale in black-and-white, and a fuller spectrum of colors, making kinescopes a perfectly viable commodity. This was demonstrated in the feature film Ten from Your Show of Shows, a compilation of Sid Caesar kinescopes released to theaters. Reviewers were astonished at how good the kinescoped image looked on a large screen. Kinescopes have since lost their stigma of inferiority, and are commonly consulted today for archival purposes. Up until the early 1960s, much of the BBC's output, and British television in general, was broadcast live, and telerecordings would be used to preserve a programme for repeat showings, which had previously required the entire production being performed live for a second time. In the UK, telerecordings continued to be made after the advent of commercial broadcast videotape from 1958 as they possessed several distinct advantages, particularly for overseas program sales. Firstly, they were cheaper, easier to transport and more durable than video. Secondly, they could be used in any country regardless of the television broadcasting standard, which was not true of videotape. Thirdly, the system could be used to make black and white copies of color programs for sale to television stations who were not yet broadcasting in color. The telerecording system could be of a very high quality, easily reproducing the full detail of the television picture. One side effect of the system was that it removed the 'fluid' look of interlaced video and 'filmized' the picture. The system was largely used for black and white reproduction. Although some color telerecordings were made, they were generally in the minority as by the time color programs were widely needed for sale, video standards conversion was easier and higher quality and the price of videotape had become much reduced. Before videotape became the exclusive transmission format during the early to mid-1980s, any (color) video recordings used in documentaries or filmed program inserts were usually transferred onto film. In the 1950s a home telerecording kit was introduced in Britain, allowing enthusiasts to make 16 mm film recordings of television programs . The major drawback, apart from the short duration of a 16 mm film magazine, was that a large opaque frame had to be placed in front of the TV set in order to block out any stray reflections, making it impossible to watch the set normally while filming. It is not known if any recordings made using this equipment still exist. British broadcasters used telerecordings for domestic purposes well into the 1960s, with 35 mm being the film gauge usually used as it produced a higher quality result. For overseas sales, 16 mm film would be used, as it was cheaper. Although domestic use of telerecording in the UK for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s, 16 mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by British broadcasters well into the 1970s. Telerecording was still being used internally at the BBC in the 1980s too, to preserve copies for posterity of programs which were not necessarily of the highest importance, but which nonetheless their producers wanted to be preserved. If there were no videotape machines available on a given day, then a telerecording would be made. There is evidence to suggest that the children's magazine program Blue Peter was occasionally being telerecorded as late as 1985. After this point, however, cheap domestic videotape formats such as VHS could more easily be used to keep a back-up reference copy of a program. Another occasional use of telerecording into the late 1980s was by documentary makers working in 16 mm film who wished to include a videotape-sourced excerpt in their work, although such use was again rare. In other territories, film telerecordings stopped being produced after the introduction of videotape. In Czechoslovakia, the first videotape recorders (Machtronics MVR-15) were introduced in 1966, but soon were replaced by the Ampex 2\\" Quadruplex in 1967. Most of the programs, like TV dramas, were recorded on video, but only a few programmes continued to be telerecorded onto 16mm film. The last telerecording was produced in 1969 and soon after all programmes were recorded on video only.  Legacy  Screenshot from 1949 kinescope Kinescopes were intended to be used for immediate rebroadcast, or for an occasional repeat of a prerecorded program; thus, only a small fraction of kinescope recordings remain today. Many television shows are represented by only a handful of episodes, such as with the early television work of comedian Ernie Kovacs, and the original version of Jeopardy! hosted by Art Fleming. Another purpose of Kinescopes involved satisfying show sponsors. Kinescopes sometimes would be sent to the advertising agency for the sponsor of a show so that the ad agency could determine whether or not the sponsor's ads appeared properly. Due to this practice, some kinescopes have actually been discovered in the storage areas of some of these older advertising agencies or in the storage areas of the program sponsors themselves. Kinescopes were also used for some live television programs, like Captain Kangaroo, when back-to-back episodes were made in a day for different time zones. =In Britain= Telerecordings form an important part of British television heritage, preserving what would otherwise have been lost. Nearly every pre-1960s British television programme in the archives is in the form of a telerecording, along with the vast majority of existing 1960s output. Videotape was expensive and could be wiped and re-used; film was cheaper, smaller, and in practice more durable. Only a very small proportion of British television from the black and white era survives at all; perhaps 5% from the 1953‚Äì58 period and 8‚Äì10% from the 1960s. Many recovered programmes, particularly those made by the BBC, have been returned as telerecordings by foreign broadcasters or private film collectors from the 1980s onwards, as the BBC has taken stock of the large gaps in its archive and sought to recover as much of the missing material as possible. Many of these surviving telerecorded programmes, such as episodes of Doctor Who, Steptoe and Son and Till Death Us Do Part continue to be transmitted on satellite television stations such as UKTV Gold, and many such programmes have been released on VHS and DVD. In 2008, the BBC undertook colour restoration work on the existing 16mm monochrome telerecording of Room at the Bottom, a 1969 episode of the sitcom Dad's Army. Although this episode was originally produced and broadcast in colour, the black & white film was the only surviving copy of the episode following the wiping of the original videotape. However, the telerecording process left colour information in the form of chroma dots in the frames of the film; using a specially designed computer programme, these chroma dots were used to bring out the original colour information, which as then applied to the film, allowing the colour to be restored to the episode. The restored version of Room at the Bottom was broadcast on 13 December 2008, the first time it had been seen in colour since May 1970.  Technology  NTSC television images are scanned at roughly 60 Hz, with two interlaced fields per frame, displayed at 30 frames per second. A kinescope must be able to: #Convert the 30 frame/s image to 24 frame/s, the standard sound speed of film cameras, #Do so in a way so that the image is clear enough to then re-broadcast by means of a film chain back to 30 frame/s. In kinescoping an NTSC signal, 525 lines are broadcast in one frame. A 35 mm or 16 mm camera exposes one frame of film for every one frame of television (525 lines), and moving a new frame of film into place during the time equivalent of one field of television (131.25 lines). In the British 405-line television system, the French 819-line television system and the greater European 625-line television system, television ran at 25 frames‚Äîor more correctly, 50 fields‚Äîper second, so the film camera would also be run at 25 frames per second rather than the cinematic film standard of 24 frames. Therefore, in order to maintain successful kinescope photography, a camera must expose one frame of film for exactly 1/30th or 1/25th of a second, the time in which one frame of video is transmitted, and move to another frame of film within the small interval of 1/120 of a second. In some instances, this was accomplished through means of an electronic shutter which cuts off the TV image at the end of every set of visible lines. Most U.S. kinescope situations, however, utilized a mechanical shutter, revolving at 24 revolutions per second. This shutter had a closed angle of 72¬∞ and an open angle of 288¬∞, yielding the necessary closed time of 1/120 of a second and open time 1/30 of a second. Using this shutter, in 1 second of video (60 fields equaling 30 frames), 48 television fields (totaling to 24 frames of video) would be captured on 24 frames of film, and 12 additional fields would be omitted as the shutter closed and the film advanced. Because television is a field- rather than frame-based system, however, not all the information in the picture can be retained on film in the same way as it can on videotape. The time taken physically to move the film on by one frame and stop it so that the gate can be opened to expose a new frame of film to the two fields of television picture is much longer than the vertical blanking interval between these fields‚Äîso the film is still moving when the start of the next field is being displayed on the television screen. It is not possible to accelerate the film fast enough to get it there in time without destroying the perforations in the film stock‚Äîand the larger the film gauge used, the worse the problem becomes. The problem of adapting the way the image is either displayed or captured on film, to get around the above, was solved in various different ways as time went on‚Äîimproving the quality of the image. = Shutter bar and banding problems = The 72¬∞/288¬∞ shutter and the systematic loss of 12 fields per second were not without its side effects. In going from 30 frame/s to 24 frame/s, the camera photographed part of some fields. The juncture on the film frame where these part-fields met was called a \\"splice\\". If the timing was accurate, the splice was invisible. However, if the camera and television were out of phase, a phenomenon known as \\"shutter bar\\" or \\"banding\\" took place. If the shutter was slow in closing, overexposure resulted where the part-fields joined and the \\"shutter bar\\" took the form of a white line. If the shutter closed too soon, underexposure took place and the line was black. The term \\"banding\\" referred to the phenomenon occurring on the screen as two bars. = Suppressed field = A simpler system, less prone to breakdown, was to suppress one of the two fields in displaying the television picture. This left the time during which the second field would have been displayed for the film camera to advance the film by one frame, which proved sufficient. This method was also called 'Skip field' recording. The method had several disadvantages. In missing out every second field of video, half the information of the picture was lost on such recordings. The resulting film thus consisted of fewer than 200 lines of picture information, so as a result the line structure was very apparent; the missing field information also made movement look very 'jerky'. = Stored field = A development on the suppressed field system was to display the image from one of the fields at a much higher intensity on the television screen during the time when the film gate was closed, and then capture the image as the second field was being displayed. By adjusting the intensity of the first field, it was possible to arrange it so that the luminosity of the phosphor had decayed to exactly match that of the second field, so that the two appeared to be at the same level and the film camera captured both.This method came to be preferred. Another technique developed by the BBC, known as 'spot wobble', involved the addition of an extremely high frequency but low voltage sine wave to the vertical deflection plate of the television screen, which changed the moving 'spot' - a circular beam of electrons by which the television picture was displayed - into an elongated oval. While this made the image slightly blurred, it removed the visible line structure (by causing adjacent lines to touch, so that no separating band of darkness lay between them) and thereby resulted in a better image. It also prevented moir√© patterns appearing when the resulting film was re-broadcast on television, which occurred if the line structure on the film recording did not precisely match the scanning lines of the electronic film scanner. = Moye- Mechau film recording = The first successful procedure was to use the Mechau film projector mechanism in reverse. The Mechau system used a synchronised rotating mirror to display each frame of a film in sequence without the need for a gate. When reversed, a high-quality television monitor was set up in place of the projection screen, and unexposed film stock is run through at the point where the lamp was illuminating the film. This procedure had the advantage of capturing both fields of the frame on a film, but it was difficult to keep the mirrors running at the right speed and all the equipment adjusted correctly, which often resulted in poor quality output. An additional problem was that the whole procedure took place in an open room and it was known for insects to settle on the screen which were then permanently present on the film recording. The Mechau film magazine only held enough for nine minutes so two recorders were needed to run in sequence in order to record anything longer. = Lenses for kinescoping = Lenses did not need a great depth of field, but had to be capable both of producing a very sharp image with high resolution of a flat surface and of doing so at high speed. In order to keep from light fall-off on the perimeter of the lens, a coated lens was preferable. 40 mm or 50 mm lenses were usually used with 16mm in calibrated mounts. Focus was checked by examining a print yielded under a microscope. = Magazines and film length = In order to record half-hour programs without interruption, magazines were designed which accommodated a load of for 16 mm film. Stations recording on 35 mm utilized magazines for one hour of continuous recording. = Sound recording = The camera could be equipped with sound recording to place the soundtrack and picture on the same film for single system sound recording. More commonly, the alternative double system, whereby the soundtrack was recorded on an optical recorder or magnetic dubber in sync with the camera, yielded a better quality sound track and greatly facilitated editing. = Kinescope image = Kinescope tubes intended for photographic use were coated with phosphors rich in blue and ultra-violet radiations. This permitted the use of positive type emulsions for photographing in spite of their slow film speeds. The brightness range of kinescope tubes were about 1 to 30. Kinescope images were capable of great flexibility. The operator could make the image brighter or darker, adjust contrast, width and height, turn left, right or upside down, and positive or negative. Since kinescopes were able to produce a negative picture, direct positive recordings could be made by simply photographing a negative image on the kinescope tube. When making a negative film, in order for final prints to be in the correct emulsion position, the direction of the image was reversed on the television. This applied only when double system sound was used. = Film stock used = For kinescopes, 16 mm film was the common choice by most studios because of the lower cost of stock and film processing, but in the larger network markets, it was not uncommon to see 35 mm kinescopes, particularly for national rebroadcast. By law, all film supplied to TV stations, both 16 mm and 35 mm had to be on a non-flammable, safety film base. For U.S. video recording, fine grain positive stock was the most common used because of its low cost and high resolution yield. Of the fine grain stocks, the following were recommended by film manufacturers: * Ansco: Fine Grain Positive for Television Purposes, for making direct positive recordings with 16 mm kinescope cameras. * DuPont: Fine Grain Master Positive Film Type 628A (16 mm) and 628B (35 mm). Difference in contrast can be controlled in development. * Eastman Kodak: Eastman Fine Grain Sound Recording Film, Type 5373 (low-contrast) for negative stock where other prints would be made. Fine Grain Release Positive Film, Type 7302 (high-contrast) for direct positive recordings and single system sound recordings using variable area sound. = Common issues with kinescopes = Videotape engineer Frederick M. Remley wrote of kinescope recordings, :Because of the many variables in the combined electronic/photographic process, the quality of such recordings often leaves much to be desired. Defects often encountered in photographic recording include relatively poor image resolution; a compressed brightness range often limited by kinescope display technology to a brightness ratio of about 40:1; nonlinearity of recordings, as exemplified by lack of gradation in both the near-white and near-black portions of the reproduced pictures; and excessive image noise due to film grain and video processing artifacts. The final signal-to-noise ratio is often less than 40 dB, especially in the case of 16 mm film.In Magnetic Recording: The First Hundred Years, IEEE Press, 1998, p. 128. . Because each field is sequential in time to the next, a kinescope film frame that captured two interlaced fields at once often showed a ghostly fringe around the edges of moving objects, an artifact not as visible when watching television directly at 50 or 60 fields per second. Some kinescopes filmed the television pictures at the same frame rate of 30 full frames per second, resulting in more faithful picture quality than those that recorded at 24 frames per second. The standard was later changed for color TV to 59.94 fields/s. or 29.97 frame/s. when color TV was invented.If electrical interference was present in the old 30 frame/s, 60 fields/s black-and-white format, a shutter bar would appear horizontally across the screen and not move due to U.S. electrical standards having the same Hertz rate as the fields refresh rate in the picture. When color TV was standardized, the frame rate was shifted to 29.97 and the field rate shifted to 59.94 to allow a frequency shift not only to introduce the luminance/chrominance delay needed to share the information on the screen, but also to move the hum bar from a stationary position. In the era of early color TV, the chroma information included in the video signal filmed could cause visible artifacts. It was possible to filter the chroma out, but this was not always done. Consequently, the color information was included (but not in color) in the black & white film image. Using modern computing techniques, the color may now be recovered, a process known as color recovery. In recent years, the BBC has introduced a video process called VidFIRE, which can restore kinescope recordings to their original frame rate by interpolating video fields between the film frames. Certain performers or production companies would require that a kinescope be made of every television program. Such is the case with performers Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle, for whom nearly complete program archives exist. As Jackie Gleason's program was broadcast live in New York, the show was kinescoped for later rebroadcast for the West Coast. Per his contract, he would receive one copy of each broadcast, which he kept in his vault, and only released them to the public (on home video) shortly before his death in 1987. Milton Berle sued NBC late in his life, believing the kinescopes of a major portion of his programs were lost. However, the programs were later found in a warehouse in Los Angeles. Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions, the producers of such TV game shows as What's My Line?, had a significant portion of their output recorded on both videotape and kinescopes. These programs are rebroadcast on the American cable TV's Game Show Network. All of the NBC Symphony Orchestra telecasts with Arturo Toscanini, from 1948 to 1952, were preserved on kinescopes and later released on VHS and LaserDisc by RCA and on DVD by Testament. The original audio from the kinescopes, however, was replaced with high fidelity sound that had been recorded simultaneously either on transcription discs or magnetic tape. In the mid-90s, Edie Adams, wife of Ernie Kovacs, claimed that so little value was given to the kinescope recordings of the DuMont Television Network that after the network folded in 1956 its entire archive was dumped into upper New York bay. Today however, efforts are made to preserve the few surviving DuMont kinescopes, with the UCLA Film and Television Archive having collected over 300 for preservation. In September 2010, a kinescope of game 7 of the 1960 World Series was found in the wine cellar of Bing Crosby. The game was thought lost forever, but was preserved due to Crosby's superstition about watching the game live. The film was transferred to DVD and was broadcast on the MLB Network shortly afterwards. Because videotape records at fifty interlaced fields per second and telerecordings at twenty-five progressive frames per second, videotaped programmes that exist now only as telerecordings have lost their characteristic \\"live video\\" look and the motion now looks filmic. One solution to this problem is VidFIRE, an electronic process to restore video-type motion. Early Australian television drama series were recorded as kinescopes, such as Autumn Affair and Emergency, along with variety series like The Lorrae Desmond Show. Kinescopes continued to be made after video-tape was introduced to Australia; most existing episodes of the 1965‚Äì1967 children's series Magic Circle Club are kinescopes (per listings for episodes on National Film and Sound Archive website)  See also  * Electronovision * Intermittent mechanism * VidFIRE  References  External links  * The kinescope page of the TV museum archives * RCA Kinephoto equipment (early 1950s) * Device for recording television programs, U.S. patent application, 1945. * Synchronization of camera and television receiver tubes, U.S. patent application, 1946. * The 'Total Rewind' museum of Vintage VCRs * Kinescope ca. 1964 of a program promoting the use of video for television commercial production * \\"Telerecording\\", article from TV Mirror (1955) Category:Audiovisual introductions in 1947 Category:Film and video technology Category:Lost television shows Category:Television preservation Category:Television terminology Category:History of television Category:Obsolete technologies ","title":"Kinescope"},{"id":"165332","text":"Edward is an English given name. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon form √âadweard, composed of the elements ead \\"wealth, fortune; prosperous\\" and weard \\"guardian, protector\\". History The name Edward was popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes. The popularity of the name was revived when King Henry III of England named his firstborn son, the future Edward I of England, Edward as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, whom Henry had a deep admiration for. Variant forms The name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French √âdouard, Italian Edoardo, German and Dutch Eduard and Scandinavian/Czech Edvard.

The film's title comes from the idea expressed at both the beginning and end of the film that, if one had enough time and money, it would be possible to follow the summer up and down the world (northern to southern hemisphere and back), making it endless. The original concept was born through the suggestion of a travel agent to Brown during the planning stages of the film. The travel agent suggested that the flight from Los Angeles to Cape Town, South Africa and back would cost $50 more than a trip circumnavigating the world. After which, Bruce came up with the idea of following the summer season by traveling up and down the world. The narrative presentation eases from the stiff, formal documentary of the 1950s and early 1960s to a more casual, fun-loving and personal style filled with sly humor. The film's surf rock soundtrack was provided by the Sandals, and the theme song was written by Gaston Georis and John Blakeley of the Sandals; the theme has since become one of the best known film themes in the surf movie genre. When The Endless Summer premiered on June 15, 1966, it encouraged many surfers to travel abroad, giving birth to the \\"surf-and-travel\\" culture, with prizes for finding \\"uncrowded surf\\", meeting new people and riding the \\"perfect wave\\". It also introduced the sport, which had become popular outside of Hawaii and the Polynesian Islands in places like California and Australia, to a broader audience. In 1994, it was followed by the sequel The Endless Summer II, which was later followed by Step into Liquid, directed by Brown's son Dana, in 2003. Development Bruce Brown started surfing in the early 1950s. He took still photographs to show his mother what the draw of the sport was. While serving in the United States Navy on Oahu years later, he used an 8 mm movie camera to photograph surfers from California. Once Brown got back to the states, he edited his footage into an hour-long film. Surfer Dale Velzy showed it at his San Clemente shop, charging 25 cents for admission. Velzy bought Brown a 16 mm camera and together they raised $5,000 to make Slippery When Wet, Brown's first \\"real\\" surf film. In the winter of 1958, Brown went back to Hawaii to film the North Shore's big surf. On the plane ride over, the novice filmmaker read a book about how to make movies. Brown said, \\"I never had formal training in filmmaking and that probably worked to my advantage\\". By 1962, he had spent five years making one surf film per year. He would shoot during the fall and winter months, edit during the spring and show the finished product during the summer. Brown remembered, \\"I felt if I could take two years to make a film, maybe I could make something special\\". To do this, he would need a bigger budget than he had on previous films. To raise the $50,000 budget for The Endless Summer, Brown took the best footage from his four previous films and made Waterlogged. With the money raised from Waterlogged, Brown filmed The Endless Summer. He took the completed film to several Hollywood studio distributors but was rejected because they did not think it would have mainstream appeal. In January, he took The Endless Summer to Wichita, Kansas for two weeks where moviegoers lined up in snowy weather in the middle of winter and it went on to selling out multiple screenings. Distributors were still not convinced and Brown rented a theater in New York City where his film ran successfully for a year. After the success of the run at New York's Kips Bay Theater, Don Rugoff of Cinema 5 distribution said he did not want the film or poster changed and wanted them distributed as is, thus Brown selected him over other distributors who wished to alter the poster.

Roger Ebert said of Brown's work, \\"the beautiful photography he brought home almost makes you wonder if Hollywood hasn't been trying too hard\\". Time magazine wrote, \\"Brown leaves analysis of the surf-cult mystique to seagoing sociologists, but demonstrates quite spiritedly that some of the brave souls mistaken for beachniks are, in fact, converts to a difficult, dangerous and dazzling sport\\". In his review for The New York Times, Robert Alden wrote, \\"the subject matter itself‚Äîthe challenge and the joy of a sport that is part swimming, part skiing, part sky-diving and part Russian roulette‚Äîis buoyant fun\\". =Legacy= The then-unknown break off Cape St. Francis in South Africa became one of the world's most famous surfing sites thanks to The Endless Summer. The movie characterized Cape St. Francis as having the ‚Äúperfect wave.‚Äù In 2002, The Endless Summer was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\".  Sequels  In 1994, Brown released a sequel, The Endless Summer II, in which surfers Pat O'Connell and Robert \\"Wingnut\\" Weaver retrace the steps of Hynson and August. It shows the growth and evolution of the surfing scene since the first film, which presented only classic longboard surfing. O'Connell rides a shortboard, which was developed in the time between the two movies, and there are scenes of windsurfing and bodyboarding. The 1994 film illustrates how far surfing had spread since 1964, with footage of surf sessions in France, South Africa, Costa Rica, Bali, Java, and even Alaska. The 1994 sequel follows a similar structure to the original, with another round the world surfing adventure reflecting on cultural differences since the first film was shot. The South Africa material includes a return visit to Cape St. Francis, where the ‚Äúperfect wave‚Äù had deteriorated somewhat, due to onshore construction projects.‚ÄúFake Diamonds‚Äù, Surfer Magazine (July 22, 2010). In 2000, Dana Brown, Bruce's son, released The Endless Summer Revisited, which consisted of unused footage from the first two films, as well as original cast interviews.

As a Minnesinger, he also wrote lyric poetry. Life Statue of Wolfram at Burg Abenberg castle in alt= Little is known of Wolfram's life. There are no historical documents which mention him, and his works are the sole source of evidence. In Parzival, he talks of wir Beier (\\"we Bavarians\\"); the dialect of his works is East Franconian. This and a number of geographical references have resulted in the present-day Wolframs-Eschenbach, until 1917 Obereschenbach, near Ansbach in present-day Bavaria, being officially designated as his birthplace. However, the evidence is circumstantial and not without problems - there are at least four other places named Eschenbach in Bavaria, and Wolframs-Eschenbach was not part of the Duchy of Bavaria (Altbayern) in Wolfram's time. The arms shown in the Manesse manuscript come from the imagination of a 14th-century artist, drawing on the figure of the Red Knight in Parzival, and have no heraldic connection with Wolfram. Wolfram's work indicates a number of possible patrons (most reliably Hermann I of Thuringia), which suggests that he served at a number of courts during his life. He was presumably not a wealthy man, as he made frequent allusions to his own poverty. In his Parzival, Wolfram states that he is illiterate; while the claim is treated with scepticism by some scholars, the truth of the assertion, difficult for some moderns to believe,In the foreword to his translation of Wolfram's Parzival, A. T. Hatto opines that \\". . . his claim not to know his A B C must be discounted as one of his tactical jokes.\\" Parzival, p. vi. is impossible to ascertain. But it has been credited by many commentators. It is noted in Thomas Mann's The Magic Mountain that \\"the greatest poet of the Middle Ages, Wolfram von Eschenbach, could neither read nor write,\\"Thomas Mann, The Magic Mountain, trans. H.T. Lowe-Porter (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1946), p. 522; translation first published in 1927, the original published in 1924. and the Catholic Encyclopedia observes: \\"Wolfram in his Parzival tells us explicitly that he could neither read nor write. His poems were written down from dictation. His knowledge was extensive and varied rather than accurate. He certainly knew French, but only imperfectly; for his proper names often show a curious misunderstanding of French words and phrases.\\"The Catholic Encyclopedia. (1913). Works=Parzival= Wolfram is best known today for his Parzival, sometimes regarded as the greatest of all German epics from that time. Based on Chr√©tien de Troyes' Perceval, le Conte du Graal, it is the first extant work in German to have as its subject the Holy Grail (in Wolfram's interpretation a gemstone). In the poem, Wolfram's narrator expresses disdain for Chr√©tien's (unfinished) version of the tale, and states that his source was a poet from Provence called Kyot. =Titurel and Willehalm= Wolfram is the author of two other narrative works: the fragmentary Titurel and the unfinished Willehalm. These were both composed after Parzival, and Titurel mentions the death of Hermann I, which dates it firmly after 1217. Titurel consists of two fragments, which tell the story of Schionatulander and Sigune (lovers that were already depicted in Parzival). The first fragment deals with the birth of love between the main characters. The second fragment is quite different. Schionatulander and Sigune are alone in a forest, when their peace is suddenly disturbed by a mysterious dog, whose leash contains a story written in rubies. Sigune is eager to read the story, but the dog runs off. Schionatulander sets off to find him, but, as we already know from Parzival, he dies in the attempt. Willehalm, an unfinished poem based on the Old French chanson de geste Aliscans, was a significant work, and has been preserved in 78 manuscripts. It is set against the backdrop of the religious wars between the Christians and the Saracens. The eponymous hero Willehalm kidnaps a Saracen princess, converts her to Christianity and marries her. The Saracen king raises an army to rescue his daughter. The poem has many of the distinguishing features of medieval literature: the victory of the Christians over a much larger Saracen army, the touching death of the young knight Vivian, Willehalm's nephew and the works mirror of chivalric courage and spiritual purity. = Lyric poetry = Wolfram's nine surviving songs, five of which are dawn-songs, are regarded as masterpieces of Minnesang. Dawn-songs recount the story of a knight who spends the night with his beloved lady, but at dawn has to slip away unnoticed. Mostly it is the lady who wakes the knight up in the morning, but sometimes this mission is made by the watchman. No melodies survived. Two melodies are still connected to him, the Schwarzer Thon, attributed to Wolfram in a 14th- century manuscript, and the fragmentary and unfinished epic Titurel (after 1217) with a complicated four-line stanza form that was often used in later poems.Wolfram von Eschenbach at the Oxford Music Online =Influence= The 84 surviving manuscripts of Parzival, both complete and fragmentary, indicate the immense popularity of Wolfram's major work in the following two centuries. Willehalm, with 78 manuscripts, comes not far behind. Many of these include a continuation written in the 1240s by Ulrich von T√ºrheim under the title Rennewart. The unfinished Titurel was taken up and expanded around 1272 by a poet named Albrecht, who is generally presumed to be Albrecht von Scharfenberg and who adopts the narrative persona of Wolfram. This work is referred to as the J√ºngere Titurel (Younger Titurel). The modern rediscovery of Wolfram begins with the publication of a translation of Parzival in 1753 by the Swiss scholar Johann Jakob Bodmer. Parzival was the main source Richard Wagner used when writing the libretto to his opera, Parsifal. Wolfram himself appears as a character in another Wagner opera, Tannh√§user.

It is located on the northern part of the Campidano plain. It was established as the provincial capital on 16 July 1974. , the city had 31,671 inhabitants.All demographics and other statistics: National Institute of Statistics (Italy) (Istat). The economy of Oristano is based mainly on services, agriculture, tourism and small industries. History Port'a Ponti Door Tower in Piazza Roma Oristano was previously known by the Byzantines as Aristanis (in Byzantine Greek: ŒëœÅŒπœÉœÑŒ¨ŒΩŒπœÇ), and founded close to the ancient Phoenician settlement of Othoca (now Santa Giusta). It acquired importance in 1070, when, as a result of the frequent Saracen attacks, Archbishop Torcotorio made it the seat of the bishopric, which was previously in the nearby coastal town of Tharros. It also became the capital of the \\"Judicate\\" (equivalent to a Kingdom) of Arborea. Consequently, fortifications were designed, but the building thereof went on until judge Mariano II rose to power. In medieval times Oristano vied for power over the whole island of Sardinia, and therefore waged wars against the other Sardinian kingdoms which culminated in the attempt to conquer the whole island during the reign (1347‚Äì75) of Mariano IV and that of his son Hugh III (1376‚Äì1383) and his daughter Eleanor (1383‚Äì1404). The Judicate of Arborea held out to be the last Sardinian kingdom to cease to exist in 1420, about 10 years after the battle of Sanluri. It was transformed in Marchesato by the Aragonese and conquered, following a revolt by the last marquess Leonardo Alagon, by the Catalan troops of the Kingdom of Aragon, in 1478 after the battle of Macomer. Thereafter, Oristano's history was that of the island of Sardinia, characterised by the Aragonese-Spanish (until 1708) and Piedmontese (from 1720) dominations, and then the unification of Italy. In April 1921, David Cova, Emilio Lussu, Camillo Bellieni and other Sardinian veterans of World War I founded in the city the Sardinian Action Party. Main sights Oristano Cathedral Church of St. Francis Church of Carmine * The Tower of St. Christophoros, otherwise known as Tower of Mariano II, was built in 1290, is tall and the most striking remaining evidence of the old walls built at the time of the Judicate, as it was one of the main gates thereof. * Torrione (\\"Big Tower\\") of Portixedda. * St. Mary's Cathedral (1130) was rebuilt during the reign of Mariano II after being destroyed in a siege. Of the original structure of Mariano, only parts of the apse and base of the campanile are left, as well as the Gothic Chapel of the Rimedio, which houses some medieval sculptures. Parts of a more ancient Byzantine edifice can be seen in the court. To the 17th century renovation belongs the Chapel of the Archivietto (\\"Chapel of the Small Archive\\"). The current Baroque style is largely from the 19th-century restoration. It has been supposed that the Cathedral was used for the burials of the Judges and their families, but the subsequent dominations have deleted all traces of them. In the interior is a wooden statue of the Annunziata, attributed to Nino Pisano. * The Church of St. Francis of Assisi was built around 1200 and is currently in neo-classical style. Therewithin is the Christ of Nicodemus, a wooden sculpture believed to be the work of Valencian masters, dating back to the 14th century. * The Franciscan church of Santa Chiara (consecrated in 1428) is an edifice in French-Gothic style with a single nave and a square apse. * The Church and cloister of the Carmine is one of the best examples of Baroque-Roccoco architecture in Oristano. * The Church of Saint Sebastian is the only medieval extramural church, i.e. it is located outside the walls. * The Church of Saint Dominic (San Domenico) was built in 1634 at the initiative of friar Pietro Flores and financially supported by local nobleman Baldassarre Dedoni. Citizens also made donations in exchange for of floor space for a tomb therewithin. The building is a rectangularly-shaped chamber with two chapels formed in its right side wall: one of them is dedicated to Saint Vincent and the other one to the name of Jesus. Most notably, it has a wood retable that served as the main altar and includes several niches dedicated to Saint Dominic and other Saints. Upon the suppression of religious orders in 1832 the Dominicans, who had been in charge until then, bequeathed the church to the archconfraternity of the Saint Name of Jesus. It was thereafter refurbished several times, deconsecrated and currently serves as an Auditorium for congresses and concerts. * In the village of Massama is the small pre- Romanesque church called Oratory of the Souls, showing influences from the Visigothic art of the 8th century. GovernmentCulture=Sa Sartiglia and other events= Sartiglia Costumes of Oristano Sa Sartiglia, otherwise known at its inception as Sartilla, is an equestrian tournament held in Oristano for the past 500 years on Carnival Sunday and Mardi Gras. The tournament on Sunday is organized by the Corporation (Gremio) of farmers, whereas that on Mardi Gras is organised by the Gremio of carpenters. It has arguably an ancient Castillan origin. Researchers M. Falchi and M. Zucca found a manuscript dating the first tournament to 1543, whereas Pau, a late local historian, believed it originated in Oristano before the Spaniards set foot on the island. In fact, in a letter written to an English friar in the 14th century, St. Catherine of Siena stated that the Judge of Arborea could provide two galleys and one thousand horsemen to fight in a crusade for ten years. While being far from conclusive evidence that the tournament had already been, or was about to be held, this letter is certainly a testament to the importance of horse-breeding in Oristano and its surrounding countryside at the time. The name \\"Sartiglia\\" comes from Sortija which, in turn, evolved from the Latin word Sorticola, the diminutive form of Sors which does not only mean fate and fortune, but also \\"ring\\". The ring is a tin star provided with a hole at its centre, hanging from a ribbon strung above horseman's height across the street near the Cathedral, at which masked horsemen aim with their swords on steeds galloping at breath-taking speed, after being announced by trumpets and drums and having gathered pace down a route, covered with sand, snaking across the town centre. The number of stars caught on each day is a sign of the wealth that the harvest and carpentry work will bring to the corporations. At the end of Sa Sartiglia, elsewhere within the old walls, another sand covered route will be trodden by horses ridden by those same masked horsemen and women showing their stunning prowess, while engaging in all sorts of acrobatics on two and three galloping steeds at a time. This is called La Pariglia, and ends at sunset. Su Componidori The leader of both trials is called Su Componidori, meaning \\"the one who marshals\\". He is chosen by the members of the Corporations, who do not disclose his name until Candlemas, when Su Majorale announces it directly to the appointee and a careful selection of the horses as well as adequate practice can start. He is neither a man, nor a woman but androgynous, much akin to the land and, at the end of the tournament, blesses bystanders and the town with the \\"little doll of May\\" (Sa Pippia 'e maiu), a bunch of flowers swaddled in a ribbon, believed to pre-date the tournament itself, followed by the other horsemen at a canter first, and then alone, riding with his back on his galloping steed's, face up gazing at the Heavens. Transport Oristano can be reached by train from Sardinia's ports of Olbia and Porto Torres, and the island's main cities Cagliari and Sassari. From Oristano all villages of the province can be reached by buses departing the bus station close to centrally-located Piazza G.Manno. Moreover, a private concern provides a twice-daily bus service to and from Cagliari Elmas Airport. The journey takes approximately 2 hours. Oristano is served by the Fenosu Airport, far from the city, and by a cargo sea port. The airport isn‚Äôt operating anymore.  Geography = Climate = Oristano has a subtropical mediterranean climate with hot summers and mild winters. As manifests a mediterranean climate, precipitation patterns are highly seasonally defined, with the vast majority falling during winter. Summers are still retaining warmth and humidity during night in spite of the dry weather.

For example, a computer based book of art with minimal text, or a set of photographs or scans of pages, would not usually be called an \\"e-text\\". The term is usually synonymous with e-book. An e-text may be a binary or a plain text file, viewed with any open source or proprietary software. An e-text may have markup or other formatting information, or not. An e-text may be an electronic edition of a work originally composed or published in other media, or may be created in electronic form originally. E-text origins E-texts, or electronic documents, have been around since long before the Internet, the Web, and specialized E-book reading hardware. Roberto Busa began developing an electronic edition of Aquinas in the 1940s, while large-scale electronic text editing, hypertext, and online reading platforms such as Augment and FRESS appeared in the 1960s. These early systems made extensive use of formatting, markup, automatic tables of contents, hyperlinks, and other information in their texts, as well as in some cases (such as FRESS) supporting not just text but also graphics.Reading and Writing the Electronic Book. Nicole Yankelovich, Norman Meyrowitz, and Andries van Dam. IEEE Computer 18(10), October 1985. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=4407 \\"Just plain text\\" In some communities, \\"e-text\\" is used much more narrowly, to refer to electronic documents that are, so to speak, \\"plain vanilla ASCII\\". By this is meant not only that the document is a plain text file, but that it has no information beyond \\"the text itself\\"‚Äîno representation of bold or italics, paragraph, page, chapter, or footnote boundaries, etc. Michael S. Hart,Michael S. Hart for example, argued that this \\"is the only text mode that is easy on both the eyes and the computer\\". Hart made the correct point that proprietary word- processor formats made texts grossly inaccessible; but that is irrelevant to standard, open data formats. The narrow sense of \\"e-text\\" is now uncommon, because the notion of \\"just vanilla ASCII\\" (attractive at first glance), has turned out to have serious difficulties: First, this narrow type of \\"e-text\\" is limited to the English letters. Not even Spanish √± or the accented vowels used in many European languages cannot be represented (unless awkwardly and ambiguously as \\"~n\\" \\"a'\\"). Asian, Slavic, Greek, and other writing systems are impossible. Second, diagrams and pictures cannot be accommodated, and many books have at least some such material; often it is essential to the book. Third, \\"e-texts\\" in this narrow sense have no reliable way to distinguish \\"the text\\" from other things that occur in a work. For example, page numbers, page headers, and footnotes might be omitted, or might simply appear as additional lines of text, perhaps with blank lines before and after (or not). An ornate separator line might be represented instead by a line of asterisks (or not). Chapter and sections titles, likewise, are just additional lines of text: they might be detectable by capitalization if they were all caps in the original (or not). Even to discover what conventions (if any) were used, makes each book a new research or reverse-engineering project. In consequence of this, such texts cannot be reliably re-formatted. A program cannot reliably tell where footnotes, headers or footers are, or perhaps even paragraphs, so it cannot re-arrange the text, for example to fit a narrower screen, or read it aloud for the visually impaired. Programs might apply heuristics to guess at the structure, but this can easily fail. Fourth, and a perhaps surprisingly important issue, a \\"plain-text\\" e-text affords no way to represent information about the work. For example, is it the first or the tenth edition? Who prepared it, and what rights do they reserve or grant to others? Is this the raw version straight off a scanner, or has it been proofread and corrected? Metadata relating to the text is sometimes included with an e-text, but there is by this definition no way to say whether or where it is preset. At best, the text of the title page might be included (or not), perhaps with centering imitated by indentation. Fifth, texts with more complicated information cannot really be handled at all. A bilingual edition, or a critical edition with footnotes, commentary, critical apparatus, cross-references, or even the simplest tables. This leads to endless practical problems: for example, if the computer cannot reliably distinguish footnotes, it cannot find a phrase that a footnote interrupts. Even raw scanner OCR output usually produces more information than this, such as the use of bold and italic. If this information is not kept, it is expensive and time-consuming to reconstruct it; more sophisticated information such as what edition you have, may not be recoverable at all. If actuality, even \\"plain text\\" uses some kind of \\"markup\\"‚Äîusually control characters, spaces, tabs, and the like: Spaces between words; two returns and 5 spaces for paragraph. The main difference from more formal markup is that \\"plain texts\\" use implicit, usually undocumented conventions, which are therefore inconsistent and difficult to recognize. The narrow sense of e-text as \\"plain vanilla ASCII\\" has fallen out of favor. Nevertheless, many such texts are freely available on the Web, perhaps as much because they are easily produced as because of any purported portability advantage. For many years Project Gutenberg strongly favored this model of text, but with time, has begun to develop and distribute more capable forms such as HTML.

Oscar Wilde, first performed on Saturday, 20 February 1892, at the St James's Theatre in London. The story concerns Lady Windermere, who suspects that her husband is having an affair with another woman. She confronts him with it but although he denies it, he invites the other woman, Mrs Erlynne, to his wife's birthday ball. Angered by her husband's supposed unfaithfulness, Lady Windermere decides to leave her husband for another lover. After discovering what has transpired, Mrs Erlynne follows Lady Windermere and attempts to persuade her to return to her husband and in the course of this, Mrs Erlynne is discovered in a compromising position. It is then revealed Mrs Erlynne is Lady Windermere's mother, who abandoned her family twenty years before the time the play is set. Mrs Erlynne sacrifices herself and her reputation to save her daughter's marriage. Composition By the summer of 1891 Wilde had already written three plays: Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua had found little success, and Salome had yet to be staged. Unperturbed, he decided to write another play but turned from tragedy to comedy.Ellmann (1988:314) He went to the Lake District in the north of England, where he stayed with a friend and later met Robert Ross. Numerous characters in the play appear to draw their names from the north of England: Lady Windermere from the lake and nearby town Windermere (though Wilde had used \\"Windermere\\" earlier in Lord Arthur Savile's Crime), the Duchess of Berwick from Berwick- upon-Tweed, Lord Darlington from Darlington. Wilde began writing the play at the prodding of Sir George Alexander, the actor manager of St James's Theatre. The play was finished by October.Ellmann (1988:315) Alexander liked the play, and offered him an advance of ¬£1,000 for it. Wilde, impressed by his confidence, opted to take a percentage instead, from which he would earn ¬£7,000 in the first year alone (worth ¬£ today). Alexander was a meticulous manager and he and Wilde began exhaustive revisions and rehearsals of the play. Both were talented artists with strong ideas about their art. Wilde, for instance, emphasised attention to aesthetic minutiae rather than realism; he resisted Alexander's suggested broad stage movements, quipping that \\"Details are of no importance in life, but in art details are vital\\".Raby (1997:146) These continued after the opening night, when at the suggestion of both friends and Alexander, Wilde made changes to reveal Mrs Erylnne's relationship with Lady Windermere gradually throughout the play, rather than reserving the secret for the final act.Raby (1997:144) Despite these artistic differences, both were professional and their collaboration was a fruitful one. There is an extant manuscript of the play held in the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at the University of California in Los Angeles. Characters * Lord Windermere * Lord Darlington * Lord Augustus Lorton * Mr. Dumby * Mr. Cecil Graham * Mr. Hopper * Parker, Butler * Lady Windermere * The Duchess of Berwick * Lady Agatha Carlisle * Lady Plymdale * Lady Stutfield * Lady Jedburgh * Mrs. Cowper-Cowper * Mrs. Erlynne * Rosalie, maid Plot=Act I= The play opens in the morning room of the Windermeres' residence in London. It is tea time and Lady Windermere‚Äîwho is preparing for her coming of age birthday ball that evening‚Äîhas a visit from a friend, Lord Darlington. She shows off her new fan: a present from her husband. She explains to Lord Darlington that she is upset over the compliments he continues to pay to her, revealing that she is a Puritan and has very particular views about what is acceptable in society. The Duchess of Berwick calls and Lord Darlington leaves shortly thereafter. The Duchess informs Lady Windermere that her husband may be betraying her marriage by making repeated visits to another woman, a Mrs Erlynne, and possibly giving her large sums of money. These rumours have been gossip among London society for quite a while, though seemingly this is the first Lady Windermere has heard about it. Following the departure of the Duchess, Lady Windermere decides to check her husband's bank book. She finds the book in a desk and sees that nothing appears amiss, though on returning she discovers a second bank book: one with a lock. After prying the lock open, she finds it lists large sums of money given to Mrs Erlynne. At this point, Lord Windermere enters and she confronts him. Though he cannot deny that he has had dealings with Mrs Erlynne, he states that he is not betraying Lady Windermere. He requests that she send Mrs Erlynne an invitation to her birthday ball that evening to help her back into society. When Lady Windermere refuses, he writes out an invitation himself. Lady Windermere makes clear her intention to cause a scene if Mrs Erlynne appears, to which Lord Windermere responds that it would be in her best interest not to do so. Lady Windermere leaves in disgust to prepare for the party, and Lord Windermere reveals in soliloquy that he is protecting Mrs Erlynne's true identity to save his wife extreme humiliation. =Act II= Act II opens in the Windermeres' drawing room during the birthday ball that evening. Various guests enter, and make small-talk. Lord Windermere enters and asks Lady Windermere to speak with him, but she brushes him off. A friend of Lord Windermere's, Lord Augustus Lorton (\\"Tuppy\\"), pulls him aside to inquire about Mrs Erlynne, with whom he is enamoured. Lord Windermere reveals that there is nothing untoward in his relationship with Mrs Erlynne, and that she will be attending the ball, which comes as a great relief to Lord Augustus as he was worried about her social standing. After an unsuccessful attempt to make peace with his wife, Lord Windermere summons the courage to tell the truth to her, but at that moment Mrs Erlynne arrives at the party, where she is greeted coldly by Lady Windermere, spoiling his plan. Alone, Lady Windermere and Lord Darlington discuss Mrs Erlynne's attendance. Lady Windermere is enraged and confused and asks Lord Darlington to be her friend. Instead of friendship, Lord Darlington takes advantage of Lady Windermere's tragic state and professes his love to her, offering her his life, and inviting her to risk short-term social humiliation for a new life with him. Lord Darlington sets her an ultimatum to try to convince her to take action immediately, while still in a state of shock. Lady Windermere is shocked by the revelation, and finds she does not have the courage to take the offer. Heartbroken, Lord Darlington announces that he will be leaving the country the next day and that they will never meet again, and leaves. The guests begin to leave, and say their goodnights to Lady Windermere‚Äîsome remarking positively about Mrs Erlynne. On the other side of the room Mrs Erlynne is discussing her plans with Lord Windermere; she intends to marry Lord Augustus and will require some money from Lord Windermere. Later, Lady Windermere, in spite of her earlier reluctance, decides to depart the house at once for Lord Darlington, and leaves a note to that effect for Lord Windermere. Mrs Erlynne discovers the note and that Lady Windermere has gone, and is curiously worried by this revelation. While reading the note, a brief monologue reveals that she is in fact Lady Windermere's mother and made a similar mistake herself twenty years previously. She takes the letter and exits to locate Lady Windermere. =Act III= Lady Windermere is alone in Lord Darlington's rooms, unsure if she has made the right decision. Eventually she resolves to return to her husband, but then Mrs Erlynne appears. Despite Mrs Erlynne's honest attempts to persuade her to return home to her husband, Lady Windermere is convinced her appearance is part of some plot conceived by her and Lord Windermere. Mrs Erlynne finally breaks Lady Windermere's resistance by imploring her to return for the sake of her young child, but as they begin to exit they hear Lord Darlington entering with friends. The two women hide. The men‚Äîwho include Lord Windermere and Lord Augustus‚Äîhave been evicted from their gentlemen's club at closing time and talk about women: mainly Mrs Erlynne. One of them takes notice of a fan lying on a table (Lady Windermere's) and presumes that Lord Darlington presently has a woman visiting. As Lord Windermere rises to leave, the fan is pointed out to him, which he instantly recognises as his wife's. He demands to know if Lord Darlington has her hidden somewhere. Lord Darlington refuses to cooperate, believing that Lady Windermere has come to him. Just as Lord Windermere is about to discover Lady Windermere's hiding place, Mrs Erlynne reveals herself instead, shocking all the men and allowing Lady Windermere to slip away unnoticed. =Act IV= The next day, Lady Windermere is lying on the couch of the morning room anxious about whether to tell her husband what actually happened, or whether Mrs Erlynne will have already betrayed her secret. Her husband enters. He is sympathetic towards her and suggests that as the London season is almost over that they head to their country estate to forget the recent incident. Lady Windermere apologises for her previous suspicion of her husband and behaviour at the party, and Lord Windermere makes clear his new contempt for Mrs Erlynne‚Äîwarning his wife to stay away from her. Mrs Erlynne's arrival is announced along with the return of the fan, and despite her husband's protestations, Lady Windermere insists on seeing her. Mrs Erlynne enters and states that she shall be going abroad, but asks that Lady Windermere give her a photograph of herself and her son. Whilst Lady Windermere leaves the room to find one, the story is revealed: Mrs Erlynne left her husband for a lover shortly after Lady Windermere's birth. When her new lover abandoned her, Mrs Erlynne was left alone and in disrepute. More recently, using the assumed name of Mrs Erlynne, she has begun blackmailing Lord Windermere to regain her lifestyle and status, by threatening to reveal her true identity as Lady Windermere's shameful mother‚Äînot dead, as Lady Windermere believes. Her son-in-law, Lord Windermere laments not having told his wife the whole story at once and resolves to tell her the truth now. Mrs Erlynne forbids him to do so, threatening to spread shame far and wide if he does. Lady Windermere returns with the photograph which she presents to Mrs Erlynne, and requests that Lord Windermere check for the return of Mrs Erlynne's coach. Now that they are alone, and being owed a favour, Mrs Erlynne demands that Lady Windermere not reveal the truth about the events of the previous night to Lord Windermere, and Lady Windermere promises to keep the secret. After Lord Windermere's return, Lord Augustus enters. He is shocked to see Mrs Erlynne after the events of the night before, but she requests his company as she heads to her carriage, and he soon returns to the Windermeres with news that she has satisfactorily explained the events of the evening, and that they are to marry and live out of England. Their marriage is restored, but both Lord and Lady Windermere keep their secrets. Productions=Premiere= The premiere at the St James's Theatre was followed by a famous speech by Wilde. When Wilde answered the calls of \\"Author!\\" and appeared before the curtains after the third act, critics were more offended by the cigarette in his hand than his ironically egotistic speech: > Ladies and Gentlemen. I have enjoyed this evening immensely. The actors have > given us a charming rendering of a delightful play, and your appreciation > has been most intelligent. I congratulate you on the great success of your > performance, which persuades me that you think almost as highly of the play > as I do myself. Mrs. Erlynne was originated by Marion Terry, and Lady Windermere by Winifred Emery. The play's Broadway premi√®re on 5 February 1893 at Palmer's Theatre was also the first Broadway performance for stage and screen actress Julia Arthur, who played Lady Windermere in that production. Themes public monument in London. By showing in St. James's, Wilde was targeting a fashionable, upper- middle class audience and Wilde maps out the geography of their world, Grosvenor Square, Curzon Street, the park, with precision.Raby (1997:145) Peter Raby has also highlighted Lady Windermere's Fan as a good example of Wilde's most successful dramatic technique: the juxtaposition of the comic and the serious. \\"Once the absurd and the patently false have been established, the serious emotions and ideas which are explored have been given a setting which prevents them from ever becoming too serious\\".Raby (1997:147) Scholar Paul Fortunato describes Oscar Wilde as a modernist, who used his modern aesthetics so as to direct him into the realm of mass culture. Wilde's huge popularity as a playwright began with his production of Lady Windermere's Fan, his recherch√© attitude and personal aesthetics reflected in his writing. Fortunato elaborates on the facets of his aestheticism‚Äîan aestheticism that distorts and lies on the surface, rejects any notion of an authentic self, and centres on the female aesthete and woman of fashion. As he describes, understanding Wilde as a modernist through his writing of Lady Windermere's Fan can help us understand the disparity between mass culture and high society. Wilde bridges this by theorising his modern aesthetics beneath the ornamental surface of fashion and elite society. The fan that strings together the play's scenes simultaneously evokes a traditional symbol of modesty while revealing a truly modern current of infidelity.

History and operation This is an explanatory illustration prepared by Aozora Bunko as part of project encouraging Japanese citizens to contact Diet members in effort to express a point-of-view. Aozora Bunko was created on the Internet in 1997 to provide broadly available, free access to Japanese literary works whose copyrights had expired. The driving force behind the project was Michio Tomita (:ja:ÂØåÁî∞ÂÄ´Áîü, 1952‚Äì2013), who was motivated by the belief that people with a common interest should cooperate with each other.\\"Electronic Library National Liaison Conference FY2003\\", National Diet Library Newsletter.

Aozora Bunko currently includes more than 15,100 works . Public-policy advocacy organization Aozora Bunko joined with others in organizing to oppose changes in Japanese copyright law. That opposition has led to encouraging Japanese citizens to submit letters and petitions to the Japanese Cultural Affairs Agency and to members of the Diet. Graphic icon illustrating Aozora Bunko's public-policy advocacy position‚Äîopposing proposed changes to Japan's copyright laws. Japan and other countries accepted the terms of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, an 1886 international agreement about common copyright policies. Aozora Bunko adopted an advocacy role in favor of continuing with a status quo of laws that do not go beyond the minimum copyright terms of the Berne Convention have copyrights that run for the lifetime of the author plus 50 years as preferable to changes proposed by a number of powerful forces. The evolution of Aozora Bunko from a digital library to a public-policy advocacy organization is an unintended consequence which developed only after the perceived threat to the Aozora Bunko catalog and mission became otherwise unavoidable. Problems Aozora Bunko pointed that extension of the copyright term had been influenced from the document, \\"The U.S.-Japan Regulatory Reform and Competition Policy Initiative.\\" Through these annual reports, The U.S. Government was requiring that the protected period of copyright should be extended to the Japanese government: 70 years after one's death for a work by an individual, and 95 years after publication for a work by a corporation. In response, the Agency for Cultural Affairs in Japan has expressed that a conclusion was obtained at the Council for Cultural Affairs copyright subcommittee by the end of 2007. If the legal revision which extends a protected period will be actually carried out, Aozora Bunko would be forced not to publish books which have already and almost been published because of the 20 years' extension of protection of copyright. Therefore, Aozora Bunko released the counter declaration against enforcement of the revised law on 1 January 2005; they started to collect the signatures for a petition on 1 January 2007. Due to the regime change in 2009 in Japan, Japanese government stopped to receive these reports from the U.S. government. Aozora Bunko does not show any responses toward that and their petition calling for opposition against the extension of copyright term stopped from the modification of October 2008. Instead of the document, the website of embassy of the United States inserted the \\"UNITED STATES-JAPAN ECONOMIC HARMONIZATION INITIATIVE\\" in February 2011.

The story, first published in 1947, follows a pearl diver, Kino, and explores man's nature as well as greed, defiance of societal norms, and evil. Steinbeck's inspiration was a Mexican folk tale from La Paz, Baja California Sur, Mexico, which he had heard in a visit to the formerly pearl-rich region in 1940. The book was adapted as a Mexican film named La Perla (1947) and as a cult Kannada movie Ondu Muttina Kathe (1987). The story is one of Steinbeck's most popular books and has been widely used in high school classes. The Pearl is sometimes considered a parable.  Summary  La Paz, Baja California Sur The Pearl, which takes place in La Paz, Baja California Sur, begins with a description of the seemingly ideal family life of the poor pearl fisherman Kino, his wife Juana, and their infant son, Coyotito. Kino watches as Coyotito sleeps, but sees a scorpion crawl down the rope that holds the hanging box where Coyotito sleeps. Kino attempts to catch the scorpion, but Coyotito bumps the rope, and the scorpion falls on him. Although Kino kills the scorpion, it stings coyotito. Juana and Kino, accompanied by their neighbors, go to see the local doctor, who refuses to treat Coyotito because Kino cannot pay enough to sustain the greedy doctor's lifestyle, and because the doctor holds racist views towards the poor Amerindians. Kino and Juana take Coyotito down near the sea, where Juana uses a seaweed poultice on Coyotito's shoulder, which is now swollen. Kino dives for oysters from his canoe, hoping to find a pearl he can sell to pay the doctor. He finds a very large oyster which yields an immense pearl, and which he dubs \\"The Pearl of the World\\". The news that Kino has found an immense pearl travels swiftly through the town of La Paz. Kino's neighbors begin to feel bitter toward him for his good fortune, but neither Kino nor Juana realizes this feeling that they have engendered. Juan Tomas, Kino's brother, asks him what he will do with his money, and Kino envisions marrying Juana in a church, and dressing Coyotito in a yachting cap and sailor suit. He claims that he will send Coyotito to school and buy a rifle for himself. The local priest, hearing the news, visits and tells Kino to remember to give thanks and to pray for guidance. The doctor also visits, and although Coyotito seems to be healing, the doctor insists that Coyotito still faces danger and treats him. Kino tells the doctor that he will pay him once he sells his pearl, and the doctor attempts to discern where the pearl is located. (Kino had buried it in the corner of his hut.) That night, a thief attempts to break into Kino's hut, but Kino drives him away. Juana warns Kino that the pearl will destroy them, but Kino insists that the pearl is their one chance for a better life, and that tomorrow they will sell it. The next day, Kino goes to sell his pearl. Unbeknownst to him and all the pearl fishers, the pearl dealers in La Paz are all employees of a single buying organisation. The dealers are employed to make it appear as though the prices offered are competitive when, in fact, they are kept very low, and the natives are cheated. The dealers are aware through the gossip of the town that a big pearl has been found and have agreed to pretend it is a freak and worthless. They offer Kino a thousand pesos for the pearl, which Kino believes is worth fifty thousand. Kino refuses to sell to the pearl dealers and decides to go to the capital instead. That night, Kino is attacked by more thieves, and Juana once again reminds him that the pearl is evil. However, Kino vows that he will not be cheated. Later that night, Juana attempts to take the pearl and throw it into the ocean, but Kino finds her and beats her for doing so. A group of men accosts Kino and knocks the pearl from his hand. Kino defends himself with his knife. Juana watches from a distance and then sees Kino approaching her, limping. A thief whose throat Kino has slit lies dead in the bush. Juana finds the pearl on the path, and the couple decides they must leave, even though the killing was in self-defense, as they will not get a fair hearing. Kino then finds that his canoe has been vandalized, their house has been searched, and the flimsy structure has been set on fire. The family takes refuge with Kino's brother Juan Tomas and Juan's wife, Apolonia. They hide the next day before setting out for the capital at night. Kino and Juana travel through the night and when dawn approaches find a concealed place to rest in the bush. Kino fears pursuit and, looking back, spots in the distance along a dirt road a man with a rifle on horseback and two skilled trackers on foot. The trackers miss Kino and Juana's carefully concealed hiding place and continue along the road. Kino knows they will return to search more thoroughly, so he and Juana leave the road and head into the mountains where they know they will leave fewer tracks on the rocky ground. They find a cave to hide in above a pool of water. At dusk the trackers arrive and make camp by the pool below them. Kino and Juana realize the trackers will eventually find them, and having stolen the pearl, will have to kill them to hide their crime. Juana and Coyotito hide in the cave while Kino goes down to the trackers with his machete. As Kino approaches unseen, the trackers hear a child's cry. They assume it is merely a coyote pup and through boredom shoot in its general direction. At that moment Kino gets nervous, thinking that the trackers will find Coyotito. He attacks the tracker, who tries to shoot him with the rifle but misses. Kino kills all three in a frenzy. However, he soon discovers that the random shot fired by the trackers has hit and killed Coyotito. Heartbroken, Juana and Kino return to La Paz. The two approach the gulf, and Kino looks at the pearl for the last time and sees in it an image of Coyotito with his head shot away. In anguish, Kino hurls the pearl into the ocean. It sinks to the bottom and is soon buried in the sand.  Setting  Steinbeck began writing the story as a movie script in 1944 and first published it as a short story called \\"The Pearl of the World\\" in the Woman's Home Companion (December 1945). The original publication is also sometimes listed as \\"The Pearl of La Paz\\". Steinbeck expanded the story to novella length and published it under the name The Pearl (1947), published by Viking Press. As he was writing the novella version, he was frequently travelling to Mexico where the film version, co-written with Jack Wagner, was being filmed. The film was also released by RKO in 1947 as a co- promotion with the book. In 2001, The Pearl was loosely adapted as a film directed by Alfredo Zacharias, starring Lukas Haas and Richard Harris, which was released directly to video in 2005. The book takes place in La pez, Baja California, Mexico. It does not take place in California. Themes Family ‚Äì One of the major themes in the novel is family. Throughout the novel, the plot discusses how the family lives before and after the pearl. It is constantly the focus of the plot and many of the decisions are based on what would be best for the family. For example, the first thing that Kino desires to do with the money from the pearl is to give his wife and Coyotito a better life. This money would pay for Coyotito‚Äôs education, better clothes, and better protection. Later, Kino also demonstrates devotion to his family by not selling to the pearl dealer. The second buyer was trying to get the pearl for less than it was worth, but Kino, with his family in mind, declined to search for a better deal. He always has his family in mind, whether it leads to warmth and happiness or destruction. It was the reason Kino got the pearl and, eventually, the reason why he threw it back into the ocean. Good and Evil ‚Äì One of the biggest themes in this novel is the one between good and evil. This theme is displayed in other themes as well and it is shown from the beginning to the end. In the beginning, Kino lives a life of simplicity and happiness but when he discovers the pearl, he believes that good will come from it. However, a sense of evil accompanies it. After that, Kino and his family were in a constant battle against evil to preserve the good that they enjoyed before. Paradox ‚Äì The theme of paradox is displayed through Kino‚Äôs desires. Once Kino discovers the pearl, he begins to dream about what could come from this fortune as greed fills his head, but as he tries to carry out this plan, the good wealth also brings destruction to his family as he treats Juana poorly and is abusive. Though Kino desires good for his family, there is a paradox of an evil reality that he does not want. Kino tries to ‚Äúavoid life‚Äôs inevitable tension‚Äù between these two but he finds that he cannot separate the good and the evil. In the end, the finding of the great prize causes him to lose another, his son.Gladstein, Mimi (4 December 2009). \\"Fish Stories: Santiago and Kino in Text and Film\\". Wiley Online Library Perseverance ‚Äì The theme of perseverance is demonstrated by many characters, but mainly Kino. Before he found the pearl, he was a noble and a very determined person who sought fortune for his family. After he finds it, he is hoping to find it in a different way. Because Kino believes that this would save his family, he persists ‚Äúthough many obstacles‚Äù that accompany the pearl. He perseveres to keep the pearl but, in the end, it was not worth keeping Characters Kino is the protagonist, and begins as a hard-working pearl diver. He has a wife, Juana, and a son, Coyotito. He is content with his life-style as a diver but is not wealthy until he discovers the pearl. After discovering the pearl, Kino gradually changes to become a completely different man. Though his family is still the center of his actions, he is also driven by his dreams of an escape from their poverty and desire give his son a better future. He quickly becomes obsessed with the material things that the pearl could bring. He is no longer content with his son being uneducated, or his family not being well-dressed. Instead of enjoying his family and their company, as he did in the beginning, he becomes discontent and always seeks more.Meyers, Michael (1 March 2004). \\"\\"Wavering Shadows: A New Jungian Perspective in Steinbeck's the Pearl\\". Steinbeck Review. 1: 132. He is also driven by his desire not to be cheated or slighted. Kino is named for the missionary Eusebio Kino.Schultz, Jeffrey D.; Li, Luchen ‚ÄúCritical companion to John Steinbeck‚Äù (2009-01-01) Juana, Kino‚Äôs wife, is a secondary character. She is a loving woman who cares for her husband and son. Throughout the experience, she remains loyal to her family but also perceives the evil forces that the valuable pearl unleashes. For example, one night, she attempts to throw the pearl back into the ocean to bring back peace and happiness to her family, .Steinbeck, John, and Jose√å Clemente Orozco. The Pearl. Penguin Books, 2017 Coyotito is Juana and Kino‚Äôs infant son. He is their only child, so his parents do everything they can to protect him. Despite his parents‚Äô love and effort, he is subject to much harm, both before and after the pearl is found. The Doctor is an unnamed character who symbolizes wealth, greed and manipulation. Before the pearl is found, he refused to heal Coyotito because the family was poor, though it would have been easy for him to do so. However, after the family have found the pearl, he personally visits them at home and acts in a much friendlier manner to them than at their first meeting. This is all down to his greed and his anticipation of a large fee. He uses the natives ignorance to his advantage by lying about how to treat Coyotito. He uses his visit to try to discern from Kino's glances where in the house the pearl may be hidden. The doctor is in stark contrast to the family and is the beginning of the evil that will be unleashed by the pearl. Juan Tomas, Kino‚Äôs brother, is wise and loyal. In the beginning, Juan Tomas warns Kino of the destruction that wealth may bring, demonstrating his love for his brother. When destruction does come, however, Juan Tomas does not turn away his brother but, instead, welcomes him in and protects him. He is one of the few characters that does not seek to gain from the pearl and shows he values the importance of family ties. Apolonia is the wife of Juan Tomas, she helped her brother to protect and hide Kino. The pearl dealers also demonstrate greed and manipulation. This time in an organised way from the cartel for which they work. When Kino tries to sell the pearl, the pearl dealers conspire to refuse to take the pearl for its actual price. Instead, they say it is almost worthless. They heighten the difference between what Kino wants from the pearl and what it actually brings.Reed, Arthea J.S. \\"A Teacher's Guide to the Penguin Edition of John Steinbeck 'The Pearl\\". Penguin: 1-5 They force Kino to make the hazardous journey to the captal city to try and get a fair price for the pearl. The thieves and trackers are shadowy figures who attack Kino from the moment it becomes widely known he has a precious object. Kino never recognizes who they are. They harass and then follow the family right to the end of the story. They force Kino to fight and kill to defend himself and his family and keep the pearl his own. In the final scenes, in which Kino is tracked by a posse, it is not clear in the text whether the group are thieves, or law enforcement officers hunting Kino for his killing of the man on the beach.  Reception and analysis  These publications praised the novel as a \\"major artistic triumph\\" and emphasizes how Steinbeck understands \\"the universal significance of life.\\" This novel did not have as great a review later on. Although many still believe that Steinbeck's work was a unique reflection on \\"the human experience\\", there are others who disagree. Now, people like Warren French criticize the novel for \\"lacking both insight and worth.\\"'Schultz, Jeffery D. (1 January 2009). Critical companion to John Steinbeck. It is not only used to teach students about literature, but is also used to discuss important lessons about life. Many believe the book is the easiest of Steinbeck's books to teach because the lessons are simple, yet significant, so, generally, students in middle school or early high school study this novel.Meyers, Michael (2005). \\"Diamond in the Rough: Steinbeck's Multifaceted Pearl\\". Steinbeck Review. 2 (2): 42‚Äì56. Teachers instruct their students to delve deeper than surface level to learn about both the simplicity and complexity of the novel, and emphasize its themes to allow students to learn more than just literacy. Jackson Benson writes, The Pearl was heavily influenced by Steinbeck's interest in the philosophy of Carl Jung. Steinbeck wrote that he created the story of The Pearl to address the themes of \\"human greed, materialism, and the inherent worth of a thing.\\" Influences Fleming & John's song, \\"The Pearl\\", is based on this story. The American composer Andrew Boysen's Concerto for Trombone and Wind Symphony (2004) was inspired by The Pearl.

It is the second entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 short subjects for the studio between 1934 and 1959. In 2002, Punch Drunks became the first and only Stooge film to be selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot A struggling boxing manager (Moe) is having lunch with three of his fighters who are threatening to quit in anger over not being paid. Upon hearing the song \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" being played by a violinist (Larry), the timid waiter attending to the group (Curly) goes into a violent fugue state and knocks out all three fighters and the restaurant owner. Moe recruits Curly as a boxer and persuades Larry to play the tune at ringside so Curly can easily defeat his opponents and win prize money. Fighting under the name \\"K.O. Stradivarius,\\" Curly quickly becomes the top contender for the heavyweight championship. As Curly trains on a rural road under Moe's supervision, they notice a young lady whose car is stuck in a ditch. Moe tries to help her, urging Curly not to get involved (\\"Boxing and women don't mix,\\" he says), but eventually asks Larry to play \\"Weasel\\" so Curly will have the strength to free the car. Curly rides away with the lady; on the night of the title bout, Moe finds them together in a dressing room and hits Curly, telling him to avoid women and go to the arena. Seconds into the first round, reigning champion Killer Kilduff (Al Hill) knocks Curly out of the ring and onto Larry, breaking his violin. Larry frantically rushes through the streets in search of anything that will play \\"Weasel\\" as Kilduff mercilessly pummels Curly. He finds a radio broadcasting the tune and hurries back to the arena with it. The music revitalizes Curly, but it ends just as he is about to land a knockout punch and the fight turns in Kilduff's favor again. An infuriated Moe smashes the radio over Larry's head and sends him out to find something else they can use. Larry commandeers a politician's campaign truck that is playing the tune, drives back to the arena, and crashes in through a side wall. Curly revives again and easily knocks Kilduff out to win the championship, then accidentally knocks out Moe and Larry as the music keeps playing.

According to Moe, the initial treatment of the script was originated by Moe; on its strength, the studio decided to produce the Stooges' next film sooner than scheduled. Filming was completed May 2‚Äì5, 1934. In 2002, Punch Drunks was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\", the only Stooge film to achieve such an honor.'Punch Drunks at threestooges.com Notes *Punch Drunks was originally titled A Symphony of Punches, but was changed before its release. The title Punch Drunks comes from the expression \\"punch drunk\\", referring to any fighter who has been hit so many times he is unsteady on his feet. Punch Drunks was remade with Shemp Howard in 1945 as A Hit With a Miss. The plot device of gaining uncontrollable strength after hearing \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" was reworked with Joe DeRita in the Stooges' 1963 feature film The Three Stooges Go Around the World in a Daze. *A colorized version of this film was released in 2004 as part of the DVD collection Goofs on the Loose. *The short is notable as being one of the few in which the Stooges are not an established trio at the beginning of the film. *Curly's first \\"woo-woo-woo!\\", done when Larry first plays \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", ended up being reused as a stock overdub in several future Stooge shorts featuring Curly. *This is the first film in which Curly calls himself a \\"victim of soycumstance!\\" (circumstance): this comment would become one of Curly's catch-phrases. *When the Stooges are taking part in Curly's first workout as a boxer (rowing down the street), Larry is playing a tune on his violin that sounds akin to \\"Let's Fall in Love\\", a song sung 23 years later by the character Tiny (Muriel Landers) in the Stooge film Sweet and Hot. Larry plays the song before he loses his balance and falls, causing Moe to push him backwards, ending up in a shallow lake. Larry, who has hidden behind the door of the dressing room, suddenly appears, attempting to play a snippet of the same song, later on in the film for the young lady in the dressing room before Moe angrily uses a bucket of water to put on his head, to tell him to go upstairs to the arena. *Character actor Charles King, who played the man standing on the back of the truck, broke his leg during the fall.Punch Drunks: Stooge Goofs *The short ends with the playing of the song \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\", which would become the opening theme for the short Pop Goes the Easel. *This is the first of several films in which a normally passive Curly sees, hears, or smells something that triggers a violent reaction from him. The idea would be reused in Horses' Collars, Grips, Grunts and Groans, and Tassels in the Air. *The boxing option in The Three Stooges video game is based on this short. *This was also the first of 9 shorts that featured Larry Fine playing his violin. *Over the course of their 24 years at Columbia Pictures, the Stooges were occasionally cast as separate characters, with this being one such occurrence (the boys start out in separate roles and end up working together). *During the fight, when Larry is seen running down the street, Curly's voice can be heard in the distance saying, \\"Run! All the way!\\" After a few seconds, he also says ‚ÄòThen come back!‚Äô This happens twice in the film. This was a mistake in production and was left in. *As the referee is introducing challenger Curly, an audience member gestures obscenely at the camera. *Larry's running down the street is sped up for comic effect, with postproduction sounds of rapid footsteps added. His frantic driving of the van, with its speakers booming out \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" (the same recording as on the radio earlier), is also sped up. *This film features a rare scene in which Moe smacks someone other than one of his two pals; as several people begin to rub Curly down after a rather painful round of boxing and accidentally pull Moe into it, he slaps one of them in the back of the head. *The opening title music, \\"I Thought I Wanted You,\\" composed by Archie Gottler (who directed the previous Stooge film, Woman Haters) and Edward Eliscu, is unique to this and next Stooge film, Men in Black. * Originally, the song \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" was going to be used, but the producer did not want to pay royalties, so the song \\"Pop Goes the Weasel\\" was selected because it was in the public domain.American Movie Classics Stooge-a- Palooza New Year's Eve Marathon 2009 *A snippet of Punch Drunks appears in the Eddie Murphy comedy Daddy Day Care. *The Stooges receive \\"story\\" credit for the short, with Curly credited under his real name; they did not actually write the script.

Two of her opening lines, \\"The boy stood on the burning deck\\" and \\"The stately homes of England\\", have acquired classic status. Ancestry Felicia Hemans' paternal grandfather was George Browne of Passage, of County Cork, Ireland; her maternal grandparents were Benedict Paul Wagner (1718‚Äì1806), wine importer at 9 Wolstenholme Square, Liverpool, and Elizabeth Haydock Wagner (d. 1814) of Lancashire. Family legend gave the Wagners a Venetian origin; family heraldry an Austrian one. The Wagners' country address was North Hall near Wigan; they sent two sons to Eton College. Of three daughters, only Felicity married [this is in contradiction with what follows, which suggests that her sister Harriet also married, and thus needs to be verified]; her husband George Browne joined his father-in-law's business and succeeded him as Tuscan and imperial consul in Liverpool. Early life and works 118 Duke Street, Liverpool, birthplace of Felicia Hemans Felicia Dorothea Browne was the fourth of six Browne children (three boys and three girls) to survive infancy. Of her two sisters, Elizabeth died about 1807 at the age of eighteen and Harriett Mary Browne (1798‚Äì1858) married first the Revd T. Hughes, then the Revd W. Hicks Owen. Harriett collaborated musically with Felicia and later edited her complete works (7 vols. with memoir, 1839). Her eldest brother, Lt-Gen. Sir Thomas Henry Browne KCH (1787‚Äì1855), had a distinguished career in the army; her second brother, George Baxter CB, served in the Royal Welch Fusiliers 23rd Foot and became a magistrate at Kilkenny in 1830 and Chief Commissioner of Police in Ireland in 1831; and her third brother, Claude Scott Browne (1795‚Äì1821), became Deputy Assistant Commissary-General in Upper Canada. Felicia was born in Liverpool, granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home at Gwrych near Abergele and later at Bronwylfa, St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \\"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\\". Lydia Sigourney says of her education: > \\"The nature of the education of Mrs. Hemans, was favourable to the > development of her genius. A wide range of classical and poetical studies, > with the acquisition of several languages, supplied both pleasant aliment > and needful discipline. She required not the excitement of a more public > system of culture,‚Äîfor the never-resting love of knowledge was her school > master.\\"Essay on the Genius and Writings of Mrs. Hemans, by Mrs Sigourney, > New York, 1845. Her sister Harriet remarked that \\"One of her earliest tastes was a passion for Shakspeare, which she read, as her choicest recreation, at six years old.\\"Memoir of the Life and Writings of Felicia Hemans by her Sister, New York, 1845. Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was fourteen, arousing the interest of poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. She quickly followed them up with \\"England and Spain\\" (1808) and \\"The domestic affections\\" (1812), the year of her marriage to Captain Alfred Hemans, an Irish army officer some years older than herself. The marriage took her away from Wales, to Daventry in Northamptonshire until 1814. During their first six years of marriage, Felicia gave birth to five sons, including G. W. Hemans and Charles Isidore Hemans, and then the couple separated. Marriage had not, however, prevented her from continuing her literary career, with several volumes of poetry being published by the respected firm of John Murray in the period after 1816, beginning with The Restoration of the Works of Art to Italy (1816) and Modern Greece (1817). Tales and Historic Scenes was the collection which came out in 1819, the year of their separation. Later life From 1831 onwards, Hemans lived in Dublin, where her younger brother had settled, and her poetic output continued. Her major collections, including The Forest Sanctuary (1825), Records of Woman and Songs of the Affections (1830) were popular, especially with female readers. Her last books, sacred and profane, were Scenes and Hymns of Life and National Lyrics, and Songs for Music. She was by now a well-known literary figure, highly regarded by contemporaries such as Wordsworth, and with a popular following in the United States and the United Kingdom. When she died of dropsy, Wordsworth, Letitia Elizabeth Landon and Walter Savage Landor composed memorial verses in her honour. She is buried in St. Ann's Church, Dawson Street. Legacy Felicia Hemans Hemans's works appeared in nineteen individual books during her lifetime. After her death in 1835, they were republished widely, usually as collections of individual lyrics and not the longer, annotated works and integrated series that made up her books. For surviving female poets, such as Caroline Norton and Letitia Elizabeth Landon, Lydia Sigourney and Frances Harper, the French Amable Tastu and German Annette von Droste-H√ºlshoff, she was a valued model. To many readers she offered a woman's voice confiding a woman's trials; to others, a lyricism consonant with Victorian sentimentality. Among the works, she valued most were the unfinished \\"Superstition and Revelation\\" and the pamphlet \\"The Sceptic,\\" which sought an Anglicanism more attuned to world religions and women's experiences. In her most successful book, Records of Woman (1828), she chronicles the lives of women, both famous and anonymous. Hemans' poem \\"The Homes of England\\" (1827) is the origin of the phrase \\"stately home\\", referring to an English country house. Despite her illustrious admirers her stature as a serious poet gradually declined, partly due to her success in the literary marketplace. Her poetry was considered morally exemplary, and was often assigned to schoolchildren; as a result, Hemans came to be seen as more a poet for children rather than on the basis of her entire body of work. Schoolchildren in the U.S. were still being taught \\"The Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England\\" in the middle of the 20th century. But by the 21st century, \\"The Stately Homes of England\\" refers to No√´l Coward's parody, not to the once- famous poem it parodied. However, her critical reputation has been re-examined in recent years. Her work has resumed a role in standard anthologies and in classrooms and seminars and literary studies, especially in the US. Other anthologised poems include \\"The Image in Lava,\\" \\"Evening Prayer at a Girls' School,\\" \\"I Dream of All Things Free,\\" \\"Night-Blowing Flowers,\\" \\"Properzia Rossi,\\" \\"A Spirit's Return,\\" \\"The Bride of the Greek Isle,\\" \\"The Wife of Asdrubal,\\" \\"The Widow of Crescentius,\\" \\"The Last Song of Sappho\\" and \\"Corinne at the Capitol\\". Casabianca Portrait of Felicia Dorothea Hemans c.1820 First published in August 1826 the poem Casabianca (also known as The Boy stood on the Burning Deck) by Hemans depicts Captain Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca and his 12-year-old son, Giocante, who both perished aboard the ship Orient during the Battle of the Nile. The poem was very popular from the 1850s on and was memorized in elementary schools for literary practice. Other poetic figures such as Elizabeth Bishop and Samuel Butler allude to the poem in their own works. \\"'Speak, Father!' once again he cried / 'If I may yet be gone! / And'‚Äîbut the booming shots replied / And fast the flames rolled on.\\" The poem is sung in ballad form (abab) and consists of a boy asking his father whether he had fulfilled his duties, as the ship continues to burn until the magazine catches fire. Hemans adds the following note to the poem: 'Young Casabianca, a boy about thirteen years old, son to the Admiral of the Orient, remained at his post (in the Battle of the Nile) after the ship had taken fire, and all the guns had been abandoned, and perished in the explosion of the vessel, when the flames had reached the powder.' Martin Gardner, Michael R. Turner, and others wrote modern day parodies that were much more upbeat and consisted of boys stuffing their faces with peanuts and bread. This contrasted sharply with the dramatic image created in Casabianca as Hemans wrote it. England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism Her second book, England and Spain, or, Valour and Patriotism, was published in 1808 and was a narrative poem honoring her brother and his military service in the Peninsular War. The poem called for an end to the tyranny of Napoleon Bonaparte and for a long- lasting peace. Multiple references to Albion, an older name for Great Britain, emphasize Hemans's patriotism. \\"For this thy noble sons have spread alarms, and bade the zones resound with BRITAIN's arms!\\" Female suicide in Hemans' works Several of Hemans's characters take their own lives rather than suffer the social, political and personal consequences of their compromised situations. At Hemans's time, women writers were often torn between a choice of home or the pursuit of a literary career. Hemans herself was able to balance both roles without much public ridicule, but left hints of discontent through the themes of feminine death in her writing. The suicides of women in Hemans's poetry dwell on the same social issue that was confronted both culturally and personally during her life: the choice of caged domestication or freedom of thought and expression. \\"The Bride of the Greek Isle\\", \\"The Sicilian Captive\\", \\"The Last Song of Sappho\\" and \\"Indian Woman's Death Song\\" are some of the most notable of Hemans' works involving women's suicides. Each poem portrays a heroine who is untimely torn from her home by a masculine force ‚Äì such as pirates, Vikings, and unrequited lovers ‚Äì and forced to make the decision to accept her new confines or command control over the situation. None of the heroines are complacent with the tragedies that befall them, and the women ultimately take their own lives in either a final grasp for power and expression or means to escape victimisation.

The original Doritos were not flavored. The first flavor was Toasted Corn, released in 1966, followed by Taco in 1967 and Nacho Cheese in 1972.A History of Doritos (a history project) Other specialty flavors began to make their debut during the late 1980s. The concept for Doritos originated in a restaurant at Disneyland. Doritos has also gained notability for its marketing campaigns, including many ads aired during the Super Bowl. History The original product was made at the Casa de Fritos (now Rancho Del Zocalo) at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, during the early 1960s. Using surplus tortillas and taking the original idea from the traditional Mexican snack known as totopo, the company-owned restaurant cut them up, fried them, and added basic seasoning, resembling the Mexican chilaquiles, but in this case being dry. Arch West was the vice president of marketing of Frito-Lay at the time, and noticed their popularity. He made a deal in 1964 with Alex Foods, the provider of many items for Casa de Fritos at Disneyland, and produced the chips for a short time regionally, before it was overwhelmed by the volume, and Frito-Lay moved the production in-house to its Tulsa plant. Doritos were released nationwide in 1966, the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the United States. According to Information Resources International, in 1993, Doritos earned $1.2 billion in retail sales, one-third of the total Frito-Lay sales for the year. Nevertheless, in the costliest redesign in Frito-Lay history, in 1994 the company spent $50 million to redesign Doritos to make the chips 20% larger, 15% thinner, and rounded the edges of the chip. Roger J. Berdusco, the vice president of tortilla chip marketing, said a primary reason for the change was \\"greater competition from restaurant-style tortilla chips, that are larger and more strongly seasoned\\". The design change was the result of a two-year market research study that involved 5,000 chip eaters. The new design gave each chip rounded corners, making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken corners. Each chip was also given more seasoning, resulting in a stronger flavor. The redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in January 1995. In the United States, Frito-Lay eliminated trans fat from all Doritos varieties in 2002. The same year, the Doritos brand began complying with U.S. Food and Drug Administration labeling regulations, four years before the regulations became mandatory. The company was sued in 1993 by Charles Grady, who claimed that his throat had been damaged while eating Doritos. According to his lawsuit, the shape and rigidity of the chips made them inherently dangerous. Grady attempted to admit into evidence a study by a former chemistry professor that calculated how best to safely swallow the chips. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court later ruled that the study did not meet scientific standards and could not be presented as evidence. In 2005, Doritos sales in the United States fell by 1.7% to $595 million. To increase sales in 2006, the company launched several new flavors, a new label, and more bilingual advertising. Frito-Lay vice president Joe Ennen described this as \\"the most significant rebranding and relaunch in Doritos' 38-year history.\\" On February 21, 2013, the Doritos logo was changed again, and the advertising slogan \\"FOR THE BOLD\\" adopted. In 2015, Doritos introduced a limited edition Rainbow Doritos product, which were only available to those making a minimum donation of $10 to the It Gets Better Project, a non-profit organization that supports LGBT youth. The promotion raised $100,000 for the organization, despite some controversy. Ingredients The original plain chips (Toasted Corn, a discontinued US variety as of 2019, but available in the UK branded as 'Lightly Salted') are made of ground corn (maize), vegetable oil, and salt. Other ingredients vary across the flavored chip varieties. Doritos made for the US market generally do not use pork-derived animal rennet in the making of the cheese flavorings used on the chip. * Nacho Cheese Doritos ingredients (U.S.), in order of percent of product: whole corn, vegetable oil (corn, soybean, and/or sunflower oil), salt, cheddar cheese (milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), maltodextrin, whey, monosodium glutamate, buttermilk solids, romano cheese (part skim cow's milk, cheese cultures, salt, enzymes), whey protein concentrate, onion powder, partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oil, corn flour, disodium phosphate, lactose, natural and artificial flavor, dextrose, tomato powder, spices, lactic acid, artificial color (including Yellow 6, Yellow 5, Red 40), citric acid, sugar, garlic powder, red and green bell pepper powder, sodium caseinate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, nonfat milk solids, whey protein isolate, corn syrup solids. In 1996, The Onion, a satirical newspaper and website, featured an article with the headline \\"Doritos Celebrates One Millionth Ingredient\\", lampooning Frito-Lay for the sheer number of ingredients found in Doritos. Concerns have been raised that the oils, flavorings and additives used in Doritos and other Frito-Lay products may be unhealthy.(Huffington Post) Dump Your Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos! There's No Excuse for Eating Junk Food Anymore Flavors \\"Nacho Cheese\\" flavored Doritos Doritos are sold in many countries worldwide in assorted flavors. They launched nationally in the United States in 1966, with only one flavor: Toasted Corn. The product proved successful, but additional market research revealed that many consumers outside the Southwest and West considered the chip to be too bland and not spicy enough for what was perceived as a Mexican snack. Frito-Lay therefore developed taco-flavored Doritos, which also became successful after they were introduced nationally in 1967. National distribution of nacho cheese-flavored Doritos began in 1972, and were also a hit. For a short period in the late 1970s, Sour Cream and Onion flavored Doritos were available, but were discontinued in the early 1980s. A Sesame seed flavored chip was also available for a short time in the late 1970s. In 1986, Cool Ranch Doritos made their debut and also became popular. Cool Ranch Doritos are sold under the name \\"Cool Original\\" in the UK and are called \\"Cool American\\" elsewhere in Europe, as ranch dressing is less common in those places. In the 1990s, in partnership with parent company PepsiCo's fast food brands, two new flavors of Doritos were introduced, Taco Bell's Taco Supreme (incorporating a \\"beef\\" flavoring that was quite different from the original 1960s \\"Taco\\" incarnation) and Pizza Hut's Pizza Cravers. After PepsiCo spun off its restaurant division in 1997, the flavors were simply renamed taco and pizza, respectively, with the pizza flavor discontinued in some markets. At around the same time, due to the popularity of Frito-Lay's Tostitos brand the unflavored Toasted Corn was briefly discontinued, then brought back. In 2008, the Taco Bell (complete with the brand name attached) flavor was temporarily re-released under the \\"Back by Popular Demand\\" label along with Four Cheese. In 1990, Jumpin' Jack Monterey Cheese flavored Doritos were introduced. This flavor was later discontinued. In 1995, Chester's Cheese Doritos were available for a limited time. This flavor introduced the familiar Cheetos flavor cheese on the typical Doritos tortilla chip. In 1997, Spicy Nacho was introduced. For a brief period in 2004, Doritos introduced new shape and form called \\"Rollitos\\", which were corn chips shaped into small tubes, like a regular triangular Dorito was \\"rolled\\" up. Rollitos flavors included Nacho Cheesier, Zesty Taco, Cooler Ranch and Queso Picante. In 2013, this idea was reintroduced and rebranded as \\"Dinamitas\\", or little sticks of dynamite. There are two varieties, a chili lime combo, and the Mojo Criollo (Creole magic), a lemon-lime and garlic flavored rolled Doritos. Dinamitas differs slightly in style than Rollitos. Rollitos had the chips baked, the tube formed with an oil-submersible box press to fry. Currently it is rolled into a tube before the baking and frying, a much simpler process. Six versions of \\"Doritos Collisions\\", which include two different flavors in the same bag, have been produced. Those varieties of Doritos Collisions are Hot Wings/Blue Cheese, Zesty Taco/Chipotle Ranch, Habanero/Guacamole, Cheesy Enchilada/Sour Cream, Pizza Cravers/Ranch, and Blaze/Ultimate Cheddar. In 2007, Doritos ran a campaign called \\"Doritos X-13D Flavor Experiment\\" where black, unidentified bags of Doritos were on the market for consumers to identify and name the flavor. The only flavor identification on these chips was \\"All American Classic\\". Cool ranch Doritos Reincarnations and relaunches of taco-flavored Doritos, including the 2008 \\"Back By Popular Demand\\" campaign, were different from the original taco flavor (A sour cream flavor had been added to the recipe around 1985). The taco chips included in the Zesty Taco and Chipotle Ranch \\"Collisions\\" bags were thought by customers to be closer to the original, but were later discontinued in most of the United States. In late 2010, the taco flavor recipe that was used in the 1980s returned in a limited edition \\"retro\\" styled bag incorporating the original Doritos logo, and in early 2011 the company announced that this incarnation would remain in the permanent product line-up. In 2008, Doritos debuted a \\"mystery flavor\\" Quests with prizes being given as puzzles were solved. The mystery flavor was Mountain Dew. In 2009, Doritos released some new flavors under the banner \\"Doritos Late Night\\": \\"Tacos at Midnight\\" and \\"Last Call Jalape√±o Popper\\". They also modified the X-13D Flavor as All Nighter Cheeseburger. 2010 saw the release of three successively spicy \\"Degree Burn\\" flavors (Blazin' Jalape√±o/Jalape√±o Fire, Fiery Buffalo and Scorchin' Habanero), cross promoted to \\"cool down\\" with Pepsi's lime \\"Cease Fire/Max Citrus Freeze\\", and the wasabi flavored Mr. Dragon's Fire Chips. 2010 saw the introduction of Doritos to New Zealand and with it flavors including Nacho Cheese, Cheese Supreme, Salted, and Salsa. This year also saw the original Taco flavor of Doritos revived in the original packaging design. In the spring of 2011, a Tapatio hot sauce flavor was released. In February 2011, Doritos Canada ran a competition to write the end of a commercial for two new flavors (\\"Onion Rings n' Ketchup\\" and \\"Blazin' Buffalo and Ranch\\"), and to vote for which of the two flavors would be taken off shelves when the contest ended. Onion Rings n' Ketchup received the most votes and remained on sale. In the spring of 2015, Doritos Roulette was released to US markets for a limited time. While all chips appeared to look the same on the outside, one out of every six chips would be extra spicy. Owing to the spicy nature of one variety contained in the pack, in July 2015 George Pindar School reported an incident where an asthmatic student \\"suffered some difficulty breathing after eating one\\". Marketing The brand's marketing campaigns have included many television commercials featuring Avery Schreiber, Jay Leno, and Ali Landry, as well as product placement in movies, such as Wayne's World. =Super Bowl= For many years, Doritos advertised heavily during the Super Bowl. According to Thomas L. Harris's Value-Added Public Relations, \\"the most-used single video news release of 1995\\" was a Doritos Super Bowl Commercial featuring recently defeated US state governors Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards. The pair were discussing change and the ad ended with viewers aware that the change they referred to was not political, but rather a new packaging for Doritos. The ad generated a great deal of publicity before it ever ran and much discussion afterward. The governors later parodied their ad; when they were interviewed on the CBS news program 60 Minutes, the two were often seen eating Doritos.Harris (1999), p. 112. In 1998, Doritos cast former Miss USA Ali Landry in a new Super Bowl Commercial. In the ad, filmed in a Laundromat, she plays a sexy customer who catches Doritos chips in her mouth as they come flying helter-skelter. The ad was such a success that Frito-Lay signed Landry, who became known as \\"The Doritos Girl,\\" to a three-year contract. For Super Bowl XLI, Doritos launched a contest, Crash the Super Bowl, to allow consumers to create their own Doritos commercial. The general public was allowed to vote for their favorite of five finalists. According to Doritos, the vote was so close that just before the game the company decided to run two of the ads rather than just one. Both commercials finished highly in ratings of commercials during this Super Bowl. The following year, Doritos sponsored a contest to find a musician to feature in a Super Bowl ad. Although the ad, featuring winner Kina Grannis, generated a lot of publicity, it ranked last in popularity among the program's ads. For Super Bowl XLIII, Doritos relaunched the fan-created commercials, with the winning vote going to the \\"Free Doritos\\" ad, which featured an office worker (Comedian Steve Booth) with a snow globe (believing it to be a crystal ball) \\"predicting\\" that everyone in the office would get free Doritos, then subsequently throws the snow globe into a vending machine selling nothing but Nacho Cheese & Cool Ranch Doritos. The commercial was ranked by the USA Today Super Bowl Ad Meter as the best ad for the year, earning the creators of the ad ‚Äì Joe and Dave Herbert ‚Äì a $1 million prize. They again aired two ads during the game ads and the second place ad also placed in the top five according to USA Today. This ad featured a man who discovers that each crunch from his bag of Doritos causes whatever is on his mind to become reality (until he runs out of chips). Another popular commercial from the group of finalist included an executive making a presentation to other executives on a new (fictional) Doritos flavor called \\"Doritos Beer\\", which, as the name implies, is beer-flavored Doritos, with each chip containing as much alcohol as an equivalent of a 16-oz. can of beer. The executive making the presentation, eating the beer-flavored chips, ends up drunk on the chips and is down to his underwear and a tie by the end of the commercial. For Super Bowl XLIV, four ads were entered, and if three of the commercials sweep the top three positions in that year's Ad Meter contest, all of the creators would be awarded a total of $5 million, broken down as $1 million for first place, $600,000 for second and $400,000 for third, plus each maker would get an additional $1 million.http://adland.tv/content/doritos- reveals-six-ads-competing-5-million-crash-super-bowl-xliv Dabitch, adland.tv, 01-07-10 For the Super Bowl XLIII as aired in Canada, Doritos aired the \\"Chip Hat\\" commercial advertising their new \\"unidentified flavor\\" chip flavor that offers a prize of CDN $25,000 + 1% of all associated sales to someone that can both name, and create an ad for the new flavor. The new winning name, Scream Cheese (or, in French, Fromage Fracassant), was submitted by Ryan Coopersmith of Montreal. For the Super Bowl XLIV Doritos aired the \\"House Rules\\" commercial, as a \\"Crash the Super Bowl\\" finalist. It was ranked by ADBOWL as the second best ad of the year. For Super Bowl XLVI, an ad aired featuring a Grandma and a baby attempting to get a bag of Doritos by a slingshot activated by a wheelchair. The bag was stolen by a child, constantly teasing them in the process. The baby reaches the bag and steals it back with just enough force to reach it. Flattering the child, Grandma and the baby eat the Doritos with ease. For Super Bowl XLIX, the ad was a father offering a large bag of Doritos to his son only if he made pigs fly. The son then proceeded to attach rockets to a pig and the father then gave the bag of Doritos. =Other= In 2008, Doritos were promoted by an \\"out-of-this-world\\" advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a planetary system 42 light years away. The project was in collaboration with EISCAT Space Center in Svalbard, Norway. The \\"You Make It, We'll Play It\\" contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards 47 Ursae Majoris, a distant star within the Ursa Major constellation that is orbited by planets which may harbor life. Doritos was the main sponsor of Wolverhampton Wanderers for the 2002/03 and 2003/04 seasons, the latter of which was spent in the Premier League. Doritos officially sponsored the \\"Hail to the Cheese Stephen Colbert's Nacho Cheese Doritos 2008 Presidential Campaign Coverage.\\" The money given to Colbert could not be used to directly fund his campaign, so he used the money to fund The Colbert Report. He claimed that he would not use his show to plug Doritos, but plugged the chips during these claims. After the campaign flopped, Colbert joked that his \\"body will stop producing bright orange waste.\\" In March 2008, Colbert partnered with Doritos, specifically the Spicy Sweet Chili flavor, to promote his Philadelphia-based coverage of the Pennsylvania primaries. In 2010, Doritos Canada launched a \\"Viralocity\\" competition, asking the public to name a new flavor and to produce an online video advertising the fictional new flavor. Natalie Armstrong submitted her video, and before long she received the most points based on numerous factors, including most widely viewed, winning a cash prize. In 2010, Doritos launched for the first time in New Zealand with Nacho Cheese, Cheese Supreme, Salsa, and Salted flavors. It replaced the long-running CC's brand. On September 20, 2011, retired Frito-Lay marketing executive Arch West, who was credited for creating Doritos as the first national tortilla chip brand, died in Dallas at age 97. It is said that corporate response showed little enthusiasm to the tortilla chip idea, but more marketing research led to the Doritos release. To coincide with the 50th anniversary of Taco Bell, Doritos and Taco Bell partnered to form the Doritos Locos Tacos, introduced on March 8, 2012. The taco is a standard Crunchy Taco. The taco comes either as a Doritos Locos Taco Supreme (ground beef, lettuce, diced tomatoes, shredded cheese, and sour cream), or a Regular Doritos Locos Taco (ground beef, lettuce, and shredded cheese), but the taco shell is made out of Nacho Cheese Doritos. From 1978 to 1997, both Taco Bell and Doritos were under the same corporate umbrella within PepsiCo until PepsiCo spun off its restaurant business into what would eventually become what is now Yum! Brands. In March 2012, a new line of Doritos were introduced: Doritos Jacked. The chips are 40% larger than standard Doritos. In March 2013, Doritos redesigned its packaging and logo as part of its first global marketing campaign. The \\"For the Bold\\" campaign will use crowdsourcing initiatives from 37 countries, emphasizing Dorito's focus on its consumers \\"living for the moment\\" attitude. The campaign kicked off at the South by Southwest Music Conference. In April 2013, Doritos released Doritos Locos Chips with Nacho Cheese and Cool Ranch to match Taco Bells campaign. In July 2014, 7-11 released a new snack called Doritos Loaded. The breaded cheese snack was released by PepsiCo's as its first frozen food product, also available in grocery stores. Current flavors of Doritos (as of November 2014) marketed in Canada are Nacho Cheese, Zesty Cheese, Cool Ranch, Spicy Nacho, Jalape√±o Cheddar, Intense Pickle, Roulette (Nacho Cheese with 1 in 7 chips being hot) and Sweet Chili Heat. Brief stints of Jacked, Taco, Guacamole, Locos Nacho (taco and nacho), Locos Cool Ranch (taco and cool ranch) and Ketchup have been introduced with Guacamole lined to make a return in early 2015. Doritos Roasted Corn, Tapatio Hot Sauce, and Salsa Verde are also popular American flavors.

The film features a minimalist plot in which the main character, Willie, has a cousin from Hungary named Eva. Eva stays with him for ten days before going to Cleveland. Willie and his friend Eddie eventually go to Cleveland to visit Eva, and the three then take a trip to Florida. This film is shot entirely in single long takes with no standard coverage. Plot The film is a three-act story about Willie (John Lurie), who lives in Brooklyn, and his interactions with the two other main characters, his cousin Eva (Eszter Balint) and friend Eddie (Richard Edson). In the first act, Willie, a surly small-time gambler and hustler of Hungarian origin, receives a phone call from his Aunt Lotte in Cleveland informing him that his expected visit by his cousin Eva, who is coming from Hungary to live with Lotte, will have to be extended to ten days because Lotte is unexpectedly in the hospital. Willie at first makes it clear that he does not want Eva there. He even orders Eva to speak English for the ten-day period, not Hungarian, as Willie strongly identifies as \\"American.\\" But Willie soon begins to enjoy her company. He becomes protective, discouraging her from going out alone, or beyond a certain street. At one point, Eva takes the initiative to clean the apartment which is fairly dirty, finds his vacuum cleaner, plugs it in and starts vacuuming. Playfully, Willie tries to persuade her that the phrase \\"choking the alligator\\" is an American metaphor for vacuuming the floor. Eva is wise to this immediately. They both smile wryly. Yet, Willie refuses to take Eva on his trips to the race track with Eddie, Willie's good-natured but dull gambling buddy and hustling accomplice. Eddie tries to persuade Willie to bring Eva along, to no avail. Willie and Eva watch football in the afternoon and late-night sci-fi movies. His esteem for her increases when Eva comes back from an excursion with a few canned food items, a TV dinner \\"especially\\" for Willie, and to Willie's astonishment, a carton of cigarettes, all obtained without money. Willie smiles and shakes her hand, telling her \\"I think you're alright, kid.\\" Eva, smart, pretty, and low-key, likes to play her favorite song, Screamin' Jay Hawkins's \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" which Willie dislikes. He buys her a dress, which she dislikes. At this point it becomes evident that Willie has developed an attraction to Eva. After ten days Eva leaves, and Willie is clearly upset to see her go. Eddie, on his way to visit Willie, sees her discard the dress on the street, but does not tell Willie this. The second act starts a year later and opens with Willie and Eddie winning a large amount of money by cheating at a game of poker. Willie asks Eddie about borrowing his brother-in- law's car, telling him \\"I just wanna get out'a here, see sump'in different, ya know?\\". In truth, Willie wants to go to Cleveland to see Eva. It is the middle of winter. They arrive in Cleveland and after stopping at Lotte's house, they go to surprise Eva at her job at a local fast food restaurant, where she is excited and pleased to see them. However, soon after arriving in Cleveland they are just as bored as they were in New York. They play cards with Lotte to pass the time. They end up tagging along with Eva and her would-be boyfriend to the movies. They go to the pier on the frozen snow-covered lakefront to take in the view. Pressed by Eddie, Willie eventually decides to go back to New York. When they say their goodbyes, Eva jokingly suggests that if they win big at the race track, they should \\"kidnap\\" her. Willie responds they would take her someplace warm, because \\"this place is awful.\\" The final act begins with Willie suggesting to Eddie, on the road back to New York, to go to Florida instead. Willie then suggests they turn around and pick up Eva and bring her along, which they do, to Lotte's obvious consternation. The three of them get to Florida and get a room at a motel. The next morning the men leave Eva asleep in the room. Eva, having awakened to find herself alone and with no food or cash, wanders outside in the windy bleak overcast afternoon to the beach, which appears not much more appealing than the windy bleak snowy Lake Erie scene in Cleveland from which they fled. When they come back, Eva's annoyance turns to dismay when the distraught pair reveal they have lost most of their money on dog races. They go for a walk on the beach to figure out what to do. Willie is clearly annoyed with Eddie, as the dog races were his idea. Willie and Eddie decide to go out and bet the last of their money on horse races. Willie still refuses to let Eva come along, so she goes out on the beach for a walk. Wearing a flamboyant wide-brimmed straw hat she has just gotten from a gift shop, a drug dealer mistakes her for a courier he has been waiting for. He gives her an envelope containing a large sum of money while berating her and her presumed boss. She goes back to the motel, leaves some of the money for Willie and Eddie, and writes them a note explaining that she is going to the airport. Willie and Eddie, having won big at the horse races and gone through the better part of a bottle of whisky, return to the motel to find Eva gone. Willie reads her note and they go to the airport to stop her. Eva discusses with an airline ticket agent her options for flying to Europe, ending with a mention that there is a plane leaving in 44 minutes for her home city of Budapest. She appears indecisive. When Willie and Eddie get to the airport, Willie, believing Eva has boarded the flight to Budapest, conceives a plan: buy a ticket to Budapest, get on the plane, and convince Eva to stay in the United States. The second to last shot shows Eddie outside watching the plane flying overhead, lamenting that Willie was apparently not able to get off the plane and that now both Willie and Eva are headed to Budapest. The final shot, however, shows Eva back at the motel, returning to an empty room, looking tired and perplexed, toying with the straw hat.

At NYU, he had studied under director Nicholas Ray, who had brought him along as his personal assistant for the production of Lightning over Water, a portrait of Ray that was being filmed by Wim Wenders. It was Wenders who granted Jarmusch the leftover film stock from his subsequent film Der Stand der Dinge (1982) that would enable the young director to shoot the 30-minute short subject film that would become Stranger Than Paradise. This short was released as a standalone film in 1982, and shown as \\"Stranger Than Paradise\\" at the 1983 International Film Festival Rotterdam. When it was later expanded into a three-act feature, that name was appropriated for the feature itself, and the initial segment was renamed \\"The New World\\". Release and reception The film was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Cam√©ra d'Or award for debut films (1984). It also won the Golden Leopard and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury ‚Äì Special Mention at the 1984 Locarno International Film Festival, the Grand Prix of the Belgian Film Critics Association, the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in 1985 and National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Picture of 1985, the film went on to win the Kniema Junpo Award for best foreign language film in 1987, the award for National Film Registry at the National Film Preservation Board, USA in 2002. The film made $2,436,000, significantly more than its budget of around $100,000. =Critics= The film currently holds a 96% \\"fresh\\" rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.5/10 based on 20 critics. Film critic Pauline Kael gave the film a generally positive review. The film was voted the Best Picture of 1984 by the National Society of Film Critics. =Home media= Stranger Than Paradise has been released on DVD by The Criterion Collection as its 400th title. The DVD contains a second disc which includes Jarmusch's first film, Permanent Vacation (1980). Both films were restored for the DVD release using high- definition digital transfers overseen and sanctioned by the director. Supplementary footage on the second disc includes Kino ‚Äô84: Jim Jarmusch, a series of interviews with the cast and crew from both films by a German television program, as well as Some Days in January (1984), a behind-the- scenes Super-8 film by the director's brother. An accompanying booklet features Jarmusch's 1984 essay \\"Some Notes on Stranger Than Paradise\\" as well as critical commentary by Geoff Andrew and J. Hoberman on Stranger Than Paradise and by Luc Sante on Permanent Vacation. Legacy Stranger Than Paradise broke many conventions of traditional Hollywood filmmaking, and became a landmark work in modern independent film. According to allmovie, it is \\"one of the most influential movies of the 1980s\\", and cast \\"a wide shadow over the new generation of independent American filmmakers to come. It is cited for giving \\"an early example of the low-budget independent wave that would dominate the cinematic marketplace a decade later\\". The success of the film accorded Jarmusch a certain iconic status within arthouse cinema, as an idiosyncratic and uncompromising auteur exuding the aura of urban cool embodied by downtown Manhattan. In a 2005 profile of the director for The New York Times, critic Lynn Hirschberg declared the film to have \\"permanently upended the idea of independent film as an intrinsically inaccessible avant- garde form\\". In 2002, Stranger Than Paradise was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The film was included in Jonathan Rosenbaum's Alternate 100, which was a response to the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies list. In 2003, Entertainment Weekly ranked the film #26 on their list of \\"The Top 50 Cult Films\\". Empire Magazine put the film at 14 on its list of the 50 greatest independent films of all time.Empire Features Soundtrack The film features an original soundtrack written by John Lurie, who also stars in the film. The music is performed by The Paradise Quartet, consisting of Jill B. Jaffe (viola), Mary L. Rowell (violin), Kay Stern (violin), and Eugene Moye (cello). The recording engineer for the sessions was Ollie Cotton. The original song \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" by Screamin' Jay Hawkins features prominently in the soundtrack. =Track listing=ReferencesExternal links  Stranger Than Paradise: Enter Jarmusch an essay by Geoff Andrew at the Criterion Collection Category:1980s buddy comedy films Category:1984 films Category:West German films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:Films directed by Jim Jarmusch Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Cleveland Category:Films shot in Cleveland Category:Golden Leopard winners Category:American comedy road movies Category:1980s comedy road movies Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:English-language films Category:Hungarian- language films Category:Cam√©ra d'Or winners Category:1984 comedy films Category:The Samuel Goldwyn Company films Category:National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Film winners ","title":"Stranger Than Paradise"},{"id":"165369","text":"This is Cinerama is a 1952 American documentary film directed by Merian C. Cooper and starring Lowell Thomas. It is designed to introduce the widescreen process Cinerama, which broadens the aspect ratio so the viewer's peripheral vision is involved. This is Cinerama premiered on September 30, 1952 at the Broadway Theatre, in New York City. Synopsis The film begins in black-and- white and in standard 4:3 aspect ratio, as travel writer and newscaster Lowell Thomas appears on screen to discuss the evolution of motion picture entertainment, from the earliest cave paintings designed to suggest movement, up to the introduction of color and sound. At the conclusion of the 12-minute lecture, Thomas speaks the words \\"This is Cinerama\\" and the screen expands into the full Cinerama 2.65:1 aspect ratio and color as a series of vignettes, narrated by Thomas begin. The film includes POV scenes of the Atom Smasher roller coaster from Rockaways' Playland, then moves on to a scene of the temple dance from the La Scala opera company's production of A√Øda. Also seen are views of Niagara Falls; a performance by a church choir (out of pace with the rest of the film, this segment is shot in black and white); a performance by the Vienna Boys' Choir; scenes of the canals of Venice; a military tattoo in Edinburgh; a bullfight in Spain; the \\"Triumphal scene\\" from A√Øda; a sound demonstration in stereo; and scenes from Cypress Gardens amusement park featuring an elaborate water skiing show.Water skis were first patented by Fred Waller, the inventor of Cinerama. The film closes with a sequence featuring soaring scenes of the natural landmarks of the American West, filmed from the nose of a low flying B-25, as the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings \\"America the Beautiful\\", \\"Come, Come Ye Saints\\", and the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic.A Century of Singing, Cornwall, 1958, p. 192 The producers were Lowell Thomas, Merian C. Cooper, and Robert L. Bendick. The film was also directed by Bendick (and an uncredited Mike Todd Jr.). Cooper had long experience with technical innovation in cinema, dating back to directing the original 1933 King Kong. Production Parts of the film were shot in the Kennecott open-pit mine and in Zion National Park in Utah. Distribution Because the new technology required a special setup of three projectors and multiple soundtracks, the film's distribution was also revolutionary. It was shown in a single theater in most cities, with reserved seats and lengthy runs - a distribution model known as a road show. For years the only way to see it in its entirety was in one of the three remaining 3-projector Cinerama installations that continue to preserve and show 35 mm prints. However, in September 2012, in celebration of the road show's 60th anniversary, Flicker Alley released the film in its original format, on Blu-ray. The image was adjusted with the \\"Smilebox\\" format, much like the Blu-ray release of How the West was Won, and will be accompanied by an Audio Commentary and an assortment of other special features. On October 18, 2012, the Turner Classic Movies cable network aired This is Cinerama in what was announced as the first American TV broadcast of the film in its original aspect ratio (again, in the Smilebox format). In May 2018, Flicker Alley re-released the movie on Blu-ray with a remastered video and audio presentation once again in its original Cinerama format. However, unlike the original 2012 Blu-ray release, which used a 65mm duplicate negative due to not having the proper fundings for a full restoration at the time, this \\"Deluxe Edition\\" release used the original camera negative as the basis for the restoration. The film's copyright status is unclear. It apparently fell into the public domain in 1980, 28 years after being filed for copyright, but some allege that it was renewed, erroneously, a matter of months after this expiration. Box office After one year, the film had played in four cities (New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and Chicago) and had sold 2,225,000 tickets grossing $4,305,000, with $2,208,000 in New York alone. At the Warner Hollywood in Los Angeles, the film played for 115 weeks, grossing an L.A. record of $3,845,200. The film played for a record 99 weeks in Chicago. By January 1954, the film had grossed $6.5 million from seven cities in the United States and Canada. A year later, Variety noted that the film was estimated to gross $25 million and included it on their all-time chart with rentals of $12.5 million. By 1995, they noted that it had grossed $41.6 million. Awards This is Cinerama was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. Although the score was credited to Louis Forbes, who conducted the music, it was composed by Paul Sawtell, Max Steiner (who composed the opening credit sequences, Cypress Gardens, the Flight Across America, and the End Credits) and Roy Webb. In 2002, the Library of Congress deemed the film \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and inducted it into the National Film Registry for permanent preservation.

Among other things it satirises the antipathy in the Church of England between High Church and Evangelical adherents. Trollope began writing this book in 1855. He wrote constantly and made himself a writing-desk so he could continue writing while travelling by train. \\"Pray know that when a man begins writing a book he never gives over\\", he wrote in a letter during this period. \\"The evil with which he is beset is as inveterate as drinking ‚Äì as exciting as gambling\\". In his autobiography, Trollope observed \\"In the writing of Barchester Towers I took great delight. The bishop and Mrs. Proudie were very real to me, as were also the troubles of the archdeacon and the loves of Mr. Slope\\". When he submitted his finished work, his publisher, William Longman, initially turned it down, finding much of it to be full of \\"vulgarity and exaggeration\\". Recent critics offer a more sanguine opinion, \\"Barchester Towers is many readers' favourite Trollope\\", wrote The Guardian, which included it in its list of \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\". Plot summary Barchester Towers concerns the leading clergy of the cathedral city of Barchester. The much loved bishop having died, all expectations are that his son, Archdeacon Grantly, will succeed him. Owing to the passage of the power of patronage to a new Prime Minister, a newcomer, the far more Evangelical Bishop Proudie, gains the see. His wife, Mrs Proudie, exercises an undue influence over the new bishop, making herself as well as the bishop unpopular with most of the clergy of the diocese. Her interference to veto the reappointment of the universally popular Mr Septimus Harding (protagonist of Trollope's earlier novel, The Warden) as warden of Hiram's Hospital is not well received, even though she gives the position to a needy clergyman, Mr Quiverful, with 14 children to support. Even less popular than Mrs Proudie is the bishop's new chaplain, the hypocritical and sycophantic Mr Obadiah Slope, who decides it would be expedient to marry Harding's wealthy widowed daughter, Eleanor Bold. Slope hopes to win her favour by interfering in the controversy over the wardenship. The Bishop or rather Mr Slope under the orders of Mrs Proudie, also orders the return of the prebendary Dr Vesey Stanhope from Italy. Stanhope has been in Italy recovering from a sore throat for 12 years and has spent his time catching butterflies. With him to the Cathedral Close come his wife and their three adult children. The younger of Dr Stanhope's two daughters causes consternation in the Palace and threatens the plans of Mr Slope. Signora Madeline Vesey Neroni is a disabled serial flirt with a young daughter and a mysterious Italian husband, whom she has left. Mrs Proudie is appalled and considers her an unsafe influence on her daughters, servants and Mr Slope. Mr Slope is drawn like a moth to a flame and cannot keep away. Dr Stanhope's son Bertie is skilled at spending money but not at making it; his sisters think marriage to rich Eleanor Bold will help. Summoned by Archdeacon Grantly to assist in the war against the Proudies and Mr Slope is the brilliant Reverend Francis Arabin. Mr Arabin is a considerable scholar, Fellow of Lazarus College at Oxford, who nearly followed his mentor John Henry Newman into the Roman Catholic Church. A misunderstanding occurs between Eleanor and her father, brother-in-law, sister and Mr Arabin, who think that she intends to marry Mr Slope, much to their disgust. Mr Arabin is attracted to Eleanor but the efforts of Grantly and his wife to stop her marrying Slope, interfere with any relationship that might develop. At the Ullathorne garden party held by the Thornes, matters come to a head. Mr Slope proposes to Mrs Bold and is slapped for his presumption; Bertie goes through the motions of a proposal to Eleanor and is refused with good grace and the Signora has a chat with Mr Arabin. Mr Slope's double-dealings are now revealed and he is dismissed by Mrs Proudie and the Signora. The Signora drops a delicate word in several ears and with the removal of their misunderstanding Mr Arabin and Eleanor become engaged. The old Dean of the Cathedral having died, Mr Slope campaigns to become Dean but Mr Harding is offered the preferment, with a beautiful house in the Close and fifteen acres of garden. Mr Harding considers himself unsuitable and with the help of the archdeacon, arranges that Mr Arabin be made Dean. With the Stanhopes' return to Italy, life in the Cathedral Close returns to normal and Mr Harding continues his life of gentleness and music. Characters of the novel=The High Church faction= * Mr Septimus Harding is the meek, elderly precentor of Barchester and Rector of the church of St. Cuthbert's near the Cathedral Close. He was formerly Warden of Hiram's Hospital but resigned in The Warden. * Archdeacon Grantly, Dr Theophilus Grantly, is the son of the former Bishop of Barchester, Dr Grantly senior, who dies at the start of the novel.

Arabin is sought out by Dr Grantly as an ally against the evangelical faction of Bishop Proudie, his wife and chaplain Obadiah Slope. * Dr Gwynne, Master of Lazarus College, another ally. =The Low Church faction= * Bishop Proudie, apparently henpecked, weak-willed and under the influence of his wife Mrs Proudie and chaplain Obadiah Slope concerning the matters of the see. * Mrs Proudie, a proud, vulgar, domineering wife, who promotes evangelical causes such as Sunday schools and is adamant in eliminating high-church rituals. * Mr Obadiah Slope, a wheedling, oleaginous chaplain who has much influence over Bishop Proudie. Midway in the novel Slope decides that he will marry Mrs Eleanor Bold (n√©e Harding). Formerly Mrs Proudie's ally, he comes into conflict with her over the wardenship of Hiram's Hospital and she regards him as a traitor. The narrator speculates that he is a lineal descendant of Doctor Slop from the novel Tristram Shandy.

It won the Oscar for Best Documentary Short Subject. An abbreviated version of it ran on the first broadcast of CBS' 60 Minutes on September 24, 1968. Why Man Creates focuses on the creative process and the different approaches taken to that process. It is divided into eight sections: The Edifice, Fooling Around, The Process, Judgment, A Parable, Digression, The Search, and The Mark. In 2002, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\\" Summary The Edifice begins with early humans hunting. They attempt to conquer their prey with stones, but fail, so they begin to use spears and bait. They kill their prey and it turns into a cave painting, upon which a building begins to be built. Throughout the rest of the section, the camera tracks upward as the edifice grows ever taller. Early cavemen begin to discover various things such as the lever, the wheel, ladders, agriculture, and fire. It then cuts to clips of early societies and civilizations. It depicts the appearance of the first religions and the advent of organized labor. It then cuts to the Great Pyramids at Giza and depicts the creation of writing. Soon an army begins to move across the screen chanting, \\"Bronze\\", but they are overrun by an army chanting, \\"Iron\\". The screen then depicts early cities and civilizations. This is followed by a black screen with one man in traditional Greek clothing who states, \\"All was in chaos 'til Euclid arose and made order.\\" Next, various Greek achievements in mathematics are depicted as Greek columns are built, around which Greeks discuss items, including, \\"What is the good life and how do you lead it?\\" \\"Who shall rule the state?\\" \\"The Philosopher King.\\" \\"The aristocrat.\\" \\"The people.\\" \\"You mean all the people?\\" \\"What is the nature of the Good? What is the nature of justice?\\" \\"What is happiness?\\" A man in a bird costume then attempts to fly, a possible reference to Icarus. The culture of ancient Greece fades into the armies of Rome. The organized armies surround the great Roman architecture as they chant, \\"Hail Caesar!\\" A man at a podium states, \\"Roman law is now in session\\", and when he bangs his gavel, the architecture collapses. Dark soldiers begin to pop up from the rubble and eventually cover the whole screen with darkness symbolizing the Dark Ages. The Dark Ages consist of inaudible whisperings and mumblings. At one point, a light clicks on and an Arab mathematician says, \\"Allah be praised. I've invented the zero.\\" at which point his colleague responds, \\"What?\\" and he says \\"Nothing, nothing.\\" Next come cloistered monks who sing in Gregorian Chant: \\"What is the shape of the Earth? Flat. What happens when you get to the edge? You fall off. Does the earth move? Never.\\" Finally the scene brightens and shows a stained glass window. Various scientists open stained glass doors and say things such as, \\"The Earth moves.\\" \\"The Earth is round.\\" \\"The blood circulates.\\" \\"There are worlds smaller than ours.\\" \\"There are worlds larger than ours.\\" Each time one opens a door, a large, hairy arm slams the door shut. Finally, the stained glass breaks in the wake of the new enlightenment. Next, Michelangelo and da Vinci are depicted. The steam engine is invented, and gears and belts begin to cover everything. The light bulb and steam locomotive are created. Darwin is referred to as two men hit each other with their canes arguing whether man is an animal. The telegraph is invented and psychology created. Next, a small creature hops across the screen saying, \\"I'm a bug, I'm a germ, I'm a bug, I'm a germ... [indrawn breath] Louis Pasteur. I'm not a bug, I'm not a germ...\\" The musicians Tchaikovsky and Beethoven are depicted. Alfred Nobel invents dynamite. Next, the cartooning shows the great speeches and documents on government and society from the American Revolution onward with quotes such as, \\"All men are created equal...\\", \\"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\\", \\"And the government, by the people,...\\", etc. and ends with \\"One world.\\" Finally, the building stops and the Wright brothers' plane lands on top of it. It is quickly covered in more advanced planes, in cars, in televisions, and finally in early computers. At the top is a radioactive atom which envelops a man in smoke. The edifice ends with that man yelling, \\"Help.\\" Fooling Around displays a random series of perspectives and the creative ideas which come from them. The Process displays a man who is making artwork from a series of geometrical figures. Each time he attempts to keep them in place, they move and rearrange themselves, or collapses altogether on the man. He tries many different approaches to the problem. In between, there are three quotations from Thomas Edison, Ernest Hemingway, and Albert Einstein on what one has to do to solve problems. Finally he accepts a working configuration and calls his wife to look at it. She says, \\"All it needs is an American flag.\\" Judgment is a series of reactions, presumably to the creation from The Process. It displays their criticisms of it, such as \\"It represents the decline of Western culture...\\", and only a very few support it. A cowboy is the human target. A lady (voice veteran June Foray) voices a sound of approval. A Parable begins at a ping-pong ball factory. Each ball is made in exactly the same way, and machines test them to get rid of anomalies. As the balls are being tested for their bounce levels, one bounces much higher than the rest. It is placed in a chute which leads to a garbage can outside the factory. It proceeds to bounce across town to a park, where it begins to bounce. Quickly, a cluster of ping-pong balls gather around it. It keeps bouncing higher and higher, until it doesn't come back. It concludes with the comment: \\"There are some who say he‚Äôs coming back and we have only to wait ... There are some who say he burst up there because balls were not meant to fly ... And there are some who maintain he landed safely in a place where balls bounce high ...\\" Digression is a very short section in which one snail says to another, \\"Have you ever thought that radical ideas threaten institutions, then become institutions, and in turn reject radical ideas which threaten institutions?\\" to which the other snail replies \\"No.\\" and the first says dejectedly, \\"Gee, for a minute I thought I had something.\\" The Search shows scientists who have been working for years on projects such as solving world hunger (James F. Bonner), developing a cure for Cancer (Renato Dulbecco), or questioning the origin of the universe (Jesse Greenstein). Then it shows a scientist, who has worked on a project for seven years, which did not work out. He is asked what he will do next, and he replies that he does not know. (Note: each of the scientists shown was working on something which still has not been solved to date, even though each one expected solid results in only a few years. This forwards the concept shown in this session far better than the creators could have known in 1968.) The Mark asks the question, Why does man create? and determines that man creates to simply state, \\"I Am.\\" The film ends by displaying \\"I Am\\" written in paint on the side of a building.

Eighteenth-century English landscape gardening and French landscape gardening often featured mock Roman temples, symbolising classical virtues. Other 18th-century garden follies represented Chinese temples, Egyptian pyramids, ruined abbeys, or Tatar tents, to represent different continents or historical eras. Sometimes they represented rustic villages, mills, and cottages to symbolise rural virtues.Yves-Marie Allain, Janine Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe, Citadelles & Mazenod, Paris, 2006. Many follies, particularly during times of famine, such as the Great Famine in Ireland, were built as a form of poor relief, to provide employment for peasants and unemployed artisans. In English, the term began as \\"a popular name for any costly structure considered to have shown folly in the builder\\", the OED's definition,Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1989, vol VI, p4, \\"Folly, 5\\". and were often named after the individual who commissioned or designed the project. The connotations of silliness or madness in this definition is in accord with the general meaning of the French word \\"folie\\"; however, another older meaning of this word is \\"delight\\" or \\"favourite abode\\".\\" ... and many French houses are still named \\"La Folie\\"\\" ‚Äì OED. This sense included conventional, practical, buildings that were thought unduly large or expensive, such as Beckford's Folly, an extremely expensive early Gothic Revival country house that collapsed under the weight of its tower in 1825, 12 years after completion. As a general term, \\"folly\\" is usually applied to a small building that appears to have no practical purpose or the purpose of which appears less important than its striking and unusual design, but the term is ultimately subjective, so a precise definition is not possible. Characteristics Hagley Castle is in the grounds of Hagley Hall. It was built by Sanderson Miller for George, Lord Lyttelton in the middle of the 18th century to look like a small ruined medieval castle. The concept of the folly is subjective and it has been suggested that the definition of a folly \\"lies in the eyes of the beholder\\". Typical characteristics include: * They have no purpose other than as an ornament. Often they have some of the appearance of a building constructed for a particular purpose, such as a castle or tower, but this appearance is a sham. Equally, if they have a purpose, it may be disguised. * They are buildings, or parts of buildings. Thus they are distinguished from other garden ornaments such as sculpture. * They are purpose-built. Follies are deliberately built as ornaments. * They are often eccentric in design or construction. This is not strictly necessary; however, it is common for these structures to call attention to themselves through unusual details or form. * There is often an element of fakery in their construction. The canonical example of this is the sham ruin: a folly which pretends to be the remains of an old building but which was in fact constructed in that state. * They were built or commissioned for pleasure. History The Pantheon at Stourhead estate Follies began as decorative accents on the great estates of the late 16th century and early 17th century but they flourished especially in the two centuries which followed. Many estates had ruins of monastic houses and (in Italy) Roman villas; others, lacking such buildings, constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures. However, very few follies are completely without a practical purpose. Apart from their decorative aspect, many originally had a use which was lost later, such as hunting towers. Follies are misunderstood structures, according to The Folly Fellowship, a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings. =Follies in 18th- century French and English gardens= The Temple of Philosophy at Ermenonville in Oise, France Follies () were an important feature of the English garden and French landscape garden in the 18th century, such as Stowe and Stourhead in England and Ermenonville and the gardens of Versailles in France. They were usually in the form of Roman temples, ruined Gothic abbeys, or Egyptian pyramids. Painshill Park in Surrey contained almost a full set, with a large Gothic tower and various other Gothic buildings, a Roman temple, a hermit's retreat with resident hermit, a Turkish tent, a shell-encrusted water grotto and other features. In France they sometimes took the form of romantic farmhouses, mills and cottages, as in Marie Antoinette's Hameau de la Reine at Versailles. Sometimes they were copied from landscape paintings by painters such as Claude Lorrain and Hubert Robert. Often, they had symbolic importance, illustrating the virtues of ancient Rome, or the virtues of country life. The temple of philosophy at Ermenonville, left unfinished, symbolised that knowledge would never be complete, while the temple of modern virtues at Stowe was deliberately ruined, to show the decay of contemporary morals. Later in the 18th century, the follies became more exotic, representing other parts of the world, including Chinese pagodas, Japanese bridges, and Tatar tents.Yves- Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, L'art des jardins en Europe, Citadelles & Mazenod, Paris, 2006. =Famine follies= The Great Famine of Ireland of 1845‚Äì49 led to the building of several follies in order to provide relief to the poor without issuing unconditional handouts. However, to hire the needy for work on useful projects would deprive existing workers of their jobs. Thus, construction projects termed \\"famine follies\\" came to be built. These included roads in the middle of nowhere, between two seemingly random points, screen and estate walls, piers in the middle of bogs, etc.Howley, James. 1993.

With ' she provided weekly luxury liner service between Southampton in the United Kingdom and New York City in the United States, via Cherbourg in France. While being constructed in the mid-1930s by John Brown and Company at Clydebank, Scotland, the build was known as Hull 552. She was launched on 27 September 1938 and named in honour of Queen Elizabeth, who was later known as the Queen Mother. With a design that improved upon that of ', Queen Elizabeth was a slightly larger ship, the largest passenger liner ever built at that time and for 56 years thereafter. She also has the distinction of being the largest- ever riveted ship by gross tonnage. She first entered service in February 1940 as a troopship in the Second World War, and it was not until October 1946 that she served in her intended role as an ocean liner. With the decline in popularity of the transatlantic route, both ships were replaced by the smaller, more economical Queen Elizabeth 2 in 1969. Queen Mary was retired from service on 9 December 1967, and was sold to the city of Long Beach, California. Queen Elizabeth was sold to a succession of buyers, most of whom had unsuccessful plans for her. Finally Queen Elizabeth was sold to Hong Kong businessman Tung Chao Yung, who intended to convert her into a floating university cruise ship called Seawise University. In 1972, whilst she was undergoing refurbishment in Hong Kong harbour, fire broke out aboard under unexplained circumstances, and the ship was capsized by the water used to fight the fire. The following year the wreck was deemed an obstruction to shipping in the area, and in 1974 and 1975 was partially scrapped where she lay. Building and design On the day RMS Queen Mary sailed on her maiden voyage, Cunard's chairman, Sir Percy Bates, informed his ship designers, headed by George Paterson, that it was time to start designing the planned second ship.RMS Queen Elizabeth from Victory to Valhalla. pp. 10 The official contract between Cunard and government financiers was signed on 6 October 1936. The new ship improved upon the design of Queen MaryMaxtone-Graham, John. The Only Way to Cross. New York: Collier Books, 1972, p. 355 with sufficient changes, including a reduction in the number of boilers to twelve instead of Queen Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner-looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, raked bow was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Queen Mary. Queen Elizabeth under construction at Clydebank Queen Elizabeth was built on slipway four at John Brown & Company in Clydebank, Scotland, Great Britain. During her construction she was more commonly known by her shipyard number, Hull 552.RMS Queen Elizabeth, The Beautiful Lady. Janette McCutcheon, The History Press Ltd (8 November 2001) The interiors were designed by a team of artists headed by the architect George Grey Wornum.The Liverpool Post, 23 August 1937 Cunard's plan was for the ship to be launched in September 1938, with fitting-out intended to be complete for the ship to enter service in the spring of 1940. Queen Elizabeth herself performed the launching ceremony on 27 September 1938. Supposedly, the liner started to slide into the water before the Queen could officially launch her, and acting sharply, she managed to smash a bottle of Australian red over the liner's bow just before it slid out of reach.Hutchings, David F. (2003) Pride of the North Atlantic. A Maritime Trilogy, Waterfront. The ship was then sent for fitting out. It was announced that on 23 August 1939 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth were to visit the ship and tour the engine room and that 24 April 1940 was to be the proposed date of her maiden voyage. Due to the outbreak of the Second World War, these two events were postponed and Cunard's plans were shattered. Queen Elizabeth sat at the fitting-out dock at the shipyard in her Cunard colours until 2 November 1939, when the Ministry of Shipping issued special licences to declare her seaworthy. On 29 December her engines were tested for the first time, running from 0900 to 1600 with the propellers disconnected to monitor her oil and steam operating temperatures and pressures. Two months later Cunard received a letter from Winston Churchill,Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 358‚Äì60 then First Lord of the Admiralty, ordering the ship to leave Clydeside as soon as possible and \\"to keep away from the British Isles as long as the order was in force\\". Second World War At the start of the Second World War, it was decided that Queen Elizabeth was so vital to the war effort that she must not have her movements tracked by German spies operating in the Clydebank area. An elaborate ruse suggested to any German observers that she would sail to Southampton to complete her fitting-out. Another factor prompting Queen Elizabeths departure was the necessity to clear the fitting-out berth at the shipyard for the battleship , which was in need of its final fitting-out. Only the berth at John Brown could accommodate the King George V-class battleships. 300px One major factor that limited the ship's departure date was that there were only two spring tides that year that would see the water level high enough for Queen Elizabeth to leave the Clydebank shipyard, and German intelligence were aware of this fact. A minimal crew of four hundred were assigned for the trip; most were transferred from and told that this would be a short coastal voyage to Southampton. Parts were shipped to Southampton, and preparations were made to move the ship into the King George V Graving Dock when she arrived. The names of Brown's shipyard employees were booked to local hotels in Southampton to give a false trail of information, and Captain John Townley was appointed as her first master. Townley had previously commanded Aquitania on one voyage, and several of Cunard's smaller vessels before that. Townley and his hastily signed-on crew of four hundred Cunard personnel were told by a company representative before they left to pack for a voyage where they could be away from home for up to six months.Floating Palaces. (1996) A&E.; TV Documentary. Narrated by Fritz Weaver By the beginning of March 1940, Queen Elizabeth was ready for her secret voyage. The Cunard colours were painted over with battleship grey, and on the morning of 3 March, the ship quietly left her moorings in the Clyde and proceeded out of the river to sail further down the coast, where she was met by a King's Messenger, who presented sealed orders directly to the captain. While waiting for the messenger, the ship was refuelled; adjustments to the compass and some final testing of equipment were also carried out before she sailed to her secret destination. Queen Elizabeth painted in wartime grey, having just transported troops to the Middle East in 1942 Captain Townley discovered that he was to take the ship directly to New York in the then neutral United States without stopping, or even slowing to drop off the Southampton harbour pilot who had embarked on at Clydebank, and to maintain strict radio silence. Later that day, at the time when she was due to arrive at Southampton, the city was bombed by the Luftwaffe. Queen Elizabeth zigzagged across the Atlantic to elude German U-boats and took six days to reach New York at an average speed of 26 knots. In New York she found herself moored alongside both Queen Mary and the French Line's , the only time all three of the world's largest ocean liners were ever berthed together. Captain Townley received two telegrams on his arrival, one from his wife congratulating him, and the other from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth thanking him for the vessel's safe delivery. The ship was then secured so that no one could board her without prior permission, including port officials. Queen Elizabeth left the port of New York on 13 November 1940 for Singapore to receive her troopship conversion. After two stops to refuel and replenish her stores in Trinidad and Cape Town, she arrived in Singapore's naval docks, where she was fitted with anti-aircraft guns, and her hull repainted grey. As a troopship, Queen Elizabeth left Singapore on 11 February, and on 23 February 1942 Queen Elizabeth secretly arrived in Esquimalt, British Columbia, Canada. She underwent refit work in drydock adding accommodation and armaments, and three hundred naval ratings quickly painted the hull.http://www.nauticapedia.ca/Articles/Queen_Elizabeth.php In mid-March, carrying 8,000 American soldiers, Queen Elizabeth began a 7,700-mile voyage from San Francisco to Sydney, Australia.The RMS Queen Elizabeth (1942) Zacha's Bay Window Gallery Initially she carried Australian troops to theatres of operation in Asia and Africa. After 1942, the two Queens were relocated to the North Atlantic for the transportation of American troops to Europe. Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary were both used as troop transports during the war. Their high speeds allowed them to outrun hazards, principally German U-boats, usually allowing them to travel outside a convoy. During her war service as a troopship, Queen Elizabeth carried more than 750,000 troops, and she also sailed some . Post-Second World War RMS Queen Elizabeth at Southampton in 1966 Following the end of the Second World War, Queen Elizabeth was refitted and furnished as an ocean liner, while her running mate Queen Mary remained in her wartime role and grey appearance except for her funnels, which were repainted in the company's colours. For another year, her sibling did military service, returning troops and G.I. brides to the United States while Queen Elizabeth was overhauled at the Firth of Clyde Drydock, in Greenock, by the John Brown Shipyard. Six years of war service had never permitted the formal sea trials to take place, so they were now finally undertaken. Under the command of Commodore Sir James Bisset, the ship travelled to the Isle of Arran and her trials were carried out. On board was the ship's namesake, Queen Elizabeth, and her two daughters, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret. During the trials, Queen Elizabeth took the wheel for a brief time, and the two young princesses recorded the two measured runs with stopwatches that they had been given for the occasion. Bisset was under strict instructions from Sir Percy Bates, who was also aboard the trials, that all that was required from the ship was two measured runs of no more than 30 knots and that she was not permitted to attempt to attain a higher speed record than Queen Mary.R.M.S. Queen Elizabeth Queen Elizabeths engines were capable of driving her to speeds of over 32 knots. After her trials Queen Elizabeth finally entered passenger service, allowing Cunard White Star to launch the long-planned two-ship weekly service to New York.Maxtone-Graham 1972, p. 396 Despite specifications similar to those of Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth never held the Blue Riband, for Cunard White Star chairman Sir Percy Bates asked that the two ships do not to try to compete against each other. The ship ran aground on a sandbank off Southampton on 14 April 1947, and was re-floated the following day. In 1955, during an annual overhaul at Southampton, England, Queen Elizabeth was fitted with underwater fin stabilisers to smooth the ride in rough seas. Two fins were fitted on each side of the hull. The fins were retractable into the hull to save fuel in smooth seas and for docking.\\"Big Liner Sprouts Fins.\\" Popular Science, June 1955, pp. 122‚Äì124. On 29 July 1959, she was in a collision with the American freighter American Hunter in foggy conditions in New York Harbor and was holed above the waterline. In New York Harbor approaching Manhattan, 1965 Together with Queen Mary and in competition with the American liners and , Queen Elizabeth dominated the transatlantic passenger trade until their fortunes began to decline with the advent of the faster and more economical jet airliner in the late 1950s. As passenger numbers declined, the liners became uneconomic to operate in the face of rising fuel and labour costs. For a short time, Queen Elizabeth‚Äînow under the command of Commodore Geoffrey Trippleton Marr‚Äîattempted a dual role in order to become more profitable; when not plying her usual transatlantic route, which she now alternated in her sailings with the French Line's SS France, the ship cruised between New York and Nassau. For this new tropical purpose, the ship received a major refit in 1965, with a new Lido deck added to her aft section, enhanced air conditioning, and an outdoor swimming pool. With these improvements, Cunard intended to keep the ship in operation until at least the mid-1970s.Maxtone- Graham 1972, p. 409 However, the strategy did not prove successful, owing to the ship's deep draught, which prevented her from entering various island ports, her width, which preventing her from using the Panama Canal, and also her high fuel costs. Cunard retired Queen Mary in 1967 and Queen Elizabeth by 1969, and replaced them with a single smaller ship, the more economical Queen Elizabeth 2. Final years New York during her last voyage, 1968.alt= In 1968, Queen Elizabeth was sold to a group of American businessmen from a company called The Queen Corporation (which was 85% owned by Cunard and 15% by them). The new company intended to operate the ship as a hotel and tourist attraction in Port Everglades, Florida, similar to the planned use of Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. Elizabeth, as she was now called, opened to tourists before Queen Mary (which opened in 1971) but it was not to last. The climate of southern Florida was much harder on Queen Elizabeth than the climate of southern California was on Queen Mary. There was some talk of permanently flooding the bilge and allowing the Queen Elizabeth to rest on the bed of the Intracoastal Waterway in Ft. Lauderdale harbour (Port Everglades) and remain open, but the ship was forced to close after losing money and being declared a fire hazard. The vessel was sold at auction in 1970 to Hong Kong tycoon Tung Chao Yung. Tung, the head of the Orient Overseas Line, intended to convert the vessel into a university for the World Campus Afloat program (later reformed and renamed as Semester at Sea). Following the tradition of the Orient Overseas Line, the ship was renamed Seawise University, as a play on Tung's initials (C.Y.'s). The ship was now under Hong Kong ownership, and it was decided to sail her to Hong Kong. This proved to be problematic, for the ship's engines and boilers were in poor condition after several years of neglect. The now retired Commodore Marr and a former chief engineer of the ship were hired by Tung as advisors for the journey to Hong Kong. Marr recommended that Seawise University be towed to the New Territories, but Tung and his crew were convinced that they could sail the ship there using just the aft engines and boilers. The planned several-week trip turned into months as the crew battled with boiler issues and a fire. An unplanned lengthy mid- voyage stopover allowed the new owners to fly spare parts out to the ship and carry out repairs before resuming the course to Hong Kong Harbour. 1972: The wreck of Seawise University, ex-Queen Elizabeth, in Hong Kong Victoria Harbour. With the ¬£5 million conversion nearing completion, the vessel caught fire on 9 January 1972. There is some suspicion that the fires were set deliberately, as several blazes broke out simultaneously throughout the ship. The fact that C.Y. Tung had acquired the vessel for $3.5 million, and had insured it for $8 million, led some to speculate that the inferno was part of a fraud to collect on the insurance claim. Others speculated that the fires were the result of a conflict between Tung, a Chinese Nationalist, and Communist-dominated ship construction unions. The ship was completely destroyed by the fire, and the water sprayed on her by fireboats caused the burnt wreck to sink in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. The vessel was finally declared a shipping hazard and dismantled for scrap between 1974 and 1975. Portions of the hull that were not salvaged were left at the bottom of the bay. The keel, boilers and engines remained at the bottom of the harbour, and the area was marked as \\"Foul\\" on local sea charts, warning ships not to try to anchor there. It is estimated that around 40‚Äì50% of the wreck was still on the seabed. In the late 1990s, the last remains of the wreck were buried during land reclamation for the construction of Container Terminal 9. Position of the wreck: . After the fire, Tung had one of the liner's anchors and the metal letters \\"Q\\" and \\"E\\" from the name on the bow placed in front of the office building at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, California, which had been intended as the headquarters of the Seawise University venture; they later went on display with commemorative plaques in the lobby of Wall Street Plaza, 88 Pine Street, New York City. Two of the ship's fire warning system brass plaques were recovered by a dredger, and were displayed at The Aberdeen Boat Club in Hong Kong in an exhibit about the ship. The charred remnants of her last ensign were cut from the flagpole and framed in 1972, and still adorn the wall of the officers' mess of marine police HQ in Hong Kong. Parker Pen Company produced a special edition of 5,000 pens made from material recovered from the wreck, each in a presentation box; today these are highly collectible. Following the demise of Queen Elizabeth, the largest passenger ship in active service became the 66,343 GT , which was longer but with less tonnage than the Cunarder. In fiction In 1959, the ship made an appearance in the British satirical comedy film The Mouse That Roared, starring Peter Sellers and Jean Seberg. While a troupe of invading men from \\"Grand Fenwick\\", a fictional European micro-nation, cross the Atlantic to 'war' with the United States, they meet and pass the far larger Queen Elizabeth, and learn that New York City is closed due to an air raid drill. Ian Fleming set the climax to his 1956 James Bond novel Diamonds Are Forever on Queen Elizabeth. The 1971 film version starring Connery used the P&O; liner for the sequence.CANBERRA ‚Äì The James Bond Ship The wreck was featured in the 1974 James Bond film The Man with the Golden Gun, as a covert headquarters for MI6.

It stars Douglas Fairbanks, Eileen Percy, Walter Bytell and Sam De Grasse. The film was adapted by Anita Loos from a story by Horace B. Carpenter and was directed by John Emerson. Plot As described in a film magazine review, Jeff Hillington (Fairbanks), son of railroad magnate Collis J. Hillington (Bytell), tires of the East and longs for the wild and woolly West. He has his apartment and office fixed up in his understanding of the accepted Western style, which he has gleaned from dime novels. A delegation from Bitter Creek comes to New York City seeking financial backing for the construction of a spur line, and go to Collis to explain their proposition. Collis sends Jeff to investigate. The citizens of Bitter Creek, Arizona, realizing that a favorable report from Jeff is necessary, decide to live up to Jeff's idea of a Western town. They set up a program with a wild reception for Jeff, a barroom dance, and a train holdup. Steve Shelby (De Grasse), a grafting Indian agent, knowing that he is about to be caught by the government, decides to do \\"one more trick\\" and enters into the plan to rob the train, turning it into a real scheme. Events turn earnest and Shelby kidnaps Nell Larabee (Percy), with whom Jeff has fallen in love. The entire crowd has been trapped in the dance hall, which is surrounded by Indians, and Jeff's revolver loaded with blanks. When the situation is finally explained to Jeff, by superhuman efforts (and typical Fairbanks surprises) he rounds up the Indians, rescues the girl, completely foils the scheme of Steve, and becomes the hero of the hour, getting to marry Nell.

The scenes of the Arizona town were shot over a week's time in Burbank, California. Joseph Henabery served as an assistant to director John Emerson. Reception Like many American films of the time, Wild and Woolly was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards. The Chicago Board of Censors required cuts of the intertitle \\"Say, that's a chance for us to clean up big,\\" all scenes of the Indian Agent and Indians with a basket containing flasks of liquor, the three intertitles \\"Whoop it up and all you capture is yours,\\" You watch every door of the hotel and after I get the girl you kill,\\" and \\"They can't hurt you, their guns are loaded with fake bullets,\\" scene where Fairbanks is shot, an Indian shoots a man, four scenes of Indians falling after being shot, and the shooting of the express messenger, taking his keys, and the rifling of the express box. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance, writing in 2008, believes Wild and Woolly \\"is the finest of the surviving Fairbanks-Emerson-Loos collaborations and perhaps the best of the thirteen films he made for Artcraft. It was also one of Fairbanks's personal favorites.\\" Vance, Jeffrey. Douglas Fairbanks (Berkeley, 2008), 47. .

Flippen. The film was shot on location in the Tennessee Valley, and was adapted by Paul Osborn from two novels: Borden Deal's Dunbar's Cove (1957) and William Bradford Huie's Mud on the Stars (1942), drawing for plot from Deal's story of a battle of wills between the nascent Tennessee Valley Authority and generations-old land owners, and from Huie's study of a rural Southern matriarchal family for characters and their reaction to destruction of their land. It marked Bruce Dern's film debut. In 2002, the film was selected for the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In the early 1930s, Chuck Glover (Montgomery Clift) arrives in Garthville, Tennessee, upstream from a new hydroelectric dam of the Tennessee Valley Authority, to head the TVA's land purchasing office after its previous supervisor quit. He is responsible for supervising the clearing of land to be flooded but must first acquire Garth Island on the Tennessee River, the last piece of property yet to be sold to the government. The previous supervisor was unable to convince elderly Ella Garth (Jo Van Fleet), matriarch of a large family that has lived on the island for decades, to sell her land to the government, which to avoid bad publicity the TVA wants to acquire without using force. The clearing of the land for the coming lake is also proceeding behind schedule because the mayor, the town's barber, uses only white labor. Chuck goes to Garth Island but Ella and the other Garth women, including Ella's granddaughter Carol Baldwin (Lee Remick), refuse to listen to him. He tries to reason with Ella's three grown sons, Hamilton (Jay C. Flippen), Cal (James Westerfield), and Joe John, but being relocated means working for a living and they have never worked in their lives. Joe John tosses Chuck into the river. Hamilton comes to Chuck's room soon after to invite him to the island for a formal apology and to speak with Ella. Chuck arrives the next day to find Ella castigating President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal to her black farm hands and their families. To make her point to Chuck, she feigns attempting to compel Sam Johnson (Robert Earl Jones), a field hand, to sell her his beloved hunting dog against his will. Chuck tries to reason with Ella, passionately laying out the benefits the dam will bring, but Ella denounces dams and the taming of the river as going \\"against nature.\\" When he asks Ella what's going to happen to her, she takes him to the family cemetery plot on the highest point of the island. There he learns from Carol that she is a widow with two small children who moved back to the island when her husband died three years before. She is also expected to marry Walter Clark (Frank Overton), a businessman in town, but Chuck urges her not to if she doesn't love him. She walks Chuck back to the ferry where the anxious field hands are also waiting. Chuck invites them to come to his office to discuss working for the TVA, reasoning that when they leave the island, Ella will have no choice except to sell. On an impulse, Carol invites Chuck to see her former home above the landing on the opposite shore. Her loneliness and attraction to Chuck combine to make her beg him to spend the night with her there. The next morning, saying goodbye, it is apparent to both that they are falling in love. Back in town Chuck apprises the mayor, who is sympathetic, of his plan but is warned that hiring \\"colored labor\\" will cause the white workers to quit and bring out other elements to oppose him. When Chuck hires Ella's field hands, three prominent businessmen urge Chuck to create segregated work gangs and pay the black workers less than the whites, which Chuck refuses to do despite insinuations that \\"less responsible\\" opponents will use harsher tactics. Carol and Chuck are confused by their passion for each other but spend another night together again at her house, unaware that Walter Clark has seen them. The next morning Ella's workers and their families pack up and leave, and Ella remains alone except for Sam, who loyally refuses to go. Ella knows what Carol and Chuck have done and when Carol begs her grandmother to join her at her own house, orders her off the island. The \\"less responsible\\" element is led by R. J. Bailey (Albert Salmi), a bully who farms cotton using black workers who are leaving him to work for the TVA. To scare Chuck from seeing Carol, Walter agrees to lure him back that night to his hotel room, where Bailey is waiting, but experiencing a change of heart when Chuck treats him decently about their rivalry for Carol, Walter warns him at the last second. Bailey demands to be compensated by the government for a worker who quit and when Chuck refuses, literally shakes him down for the money. Bailey gives it to Walter to purchase some moonshine for Chuck to console himself with. The two men get drunk together and go out to the island to talk with Ella, to whom Chuck admits his understanding of her fight to protect her dignity. The following day, Chuck learns that the dam's flood gates will be closed in a few days and Ella must be evicted immediately. Hamilton and Cal tell Chuck that they are going to have Ella declared legally incompetent to permit them to sell the land themselves, which Chuck rejects. He reluctantly asks the U.S. marshal to have Ella removed the next day, then goes to the island to use the machinations of her sons in a final attempt to persuade her to leave on her own. She calls her sons worthless and refuses to talk to him further. Carol knows that Chuck will be moving on to a new assignment within a few days and pleads with him to take her with him, telling him she would make a \\"damned good wife\\" for him. Chuck is still trying to cope with his new feelings and does not know what to say. Walter rushes to Carol's house to warn them that Bailey and his men are coming to terrorize them. While the local sheriff stands aside, telling his deputy, \\"They're just having some fun\\", the thugs shoot out a window with a rifle, overturn Chuck's car, and drive Walter's truck into the side of the house. Refusing to be run out of town, Chuck confronts Bailey but is knocked out with one punch. Carol leaps on Bailey, who hits her too, finally forcing the sheriff to run off the crowd. Chuck proposes to Carol and they are married that night by a justice of the peace. The next day, with Chuck and Carol present, Ella is read the eviction notice and leaves her island as her former workers fell the trees. At her new home, Ella sits on the porch, dispiritedly refusing to speak. Soon after, while Chuck is supervising the burning of the Garth house, Carol tells him that Ella just died. Before leaving the valley, Chuck and Carol join her family and former workers in burying Ella in the family plot, now the only part of Garth Island above water in the new lake.

The treaty was ratified by the United States on March 10 and by Mexico on May 19. The ratifications were exchanged on May 30, and the treaty was proclaimed on July 4, 1848. With the defeat of its army and the fall of its capital in September 1847, Mexico entered into negotiations with the U.S. peace envoy, Nicholas Trist, to end the war. On the Mexican side, there were factions that did not concede defeat or seek to engage in negotiations. The treaty called for the United States to pay US$15 million to Mexico and to pay off the claims of American citizens against Mexico up to US$5 million. It gave the United States the Rio Grande as a boundary for Texas, and gave the U.S. ownership of California and a large area comprising roughly half of New Mexico, most of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah and Colorado. Mexicans in those annexed areas had the choice of relocating to within Mexico's new boundaries or receiving American citizenship with full civil rights. The U.S. Senate advised and consented to ratification of the treaty by a vote of 38‚Äì14. The opponents of this treaty were led by the Whigs, who had opposed the war and rejected manifest destiny in general, and rejected this expansion in particular. The amount of land gained by the United States from Mexico was further increased as a result of the Gadsden Purchase of 1853, which ceded parts of present-day southern Arizona and New Mexico to the United States.  Negotiators  The peace talks were negotiated by Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the US State Department, who had accompanied General Winfield Scott as a diplomat and President James K. Polk's representative. Trist and General Scott, after two previous unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a treaty with General Jos√© Joaqu√≠n de Herrera, determined that the only way to deal with Mexico was as a conquered enemy. Nicholas Trist negotiated with a special commission representing the collapsed government led by Don Jos√© Bernardo Couto, Don Miguel de Atristain, and Don Luis Gonzaga Cuevas of Mexico.Defiant Peacemker: Nicholas Trist in the Mexican War, by author Wallace Ohrt  Terms  \\"Mapa de los Estados Unidos de M√©jico by John Disturnell, the 1847 map used during the negotiations Although Mexico ceded Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico, the text of the treaty did not list territories to be ceded, and avoided the disputed issues that were causes of war: the validity of the 1836 secession of the Republic of Texas, Texas's unenforced boundary claims as far as the Rio Grande, and the 1845 annexation of Texas by the United States. Instead, Article V of the treaty simply described the new U.S.‚ÄìMexico border. From east to west, the border consisted of the Rio Grande northwest from its mouth to the point where it strikes the southern boundary of New Mexico (roughly 32 degrees north), as shown in the Disturnell map, then due west from this point to the 110th meridian west, then north along the 110th Meridian to the Gila River and down the river to its mouth. Unlike the New Mexico segment of the boundary, which depended partly on unknown geography, \\"in order to preclude all difficulty in tracing upon the ground the limit separating Upper from Lower California\\", a straight line was drawn from the mouth of the Gila to one marine league south of the southernmost point of the port of San Diego, slightly north of the previous Mexican provincial boundary at Playas de Rosarito. Comparing the boundary in the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty to the Guadalupe Hidalgo boundary, Mexico conceded about 55% of its pre-war, pre-Texas territorial claims and now has an area of 1,972,550 km¬≤ (761,606 sq mi). In the United States, the 1.36 million km¬≤ (525,000 square miles) of the area between the Adams-Onis and Guadalupe Hidalgo boundaries outside the claimed by the Republic of Texas is known as the Mexican Cession. That is to say, the Mexican Cession is construed not to include any territory east of the Rio Grande, while the territorial claims of the Republic of Texas included no territory west of the Rio Grande. The Mexican Cession included essentially the entirety of the former Mexican territory of Alta California, but only the western portion of Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico, and includes all of present-day California, Nevada and Utah, most of Arizona, and western portions of New Mexico and Colorado. Articles VIII and IX ensured safety of existing property rights of Mexican citizens living in the transferred territories. Despite assurances to the contrary, the property rights of Mexican citizens were often not honored by the U.S. in accordance with modifications to and interpretations of the Treaty.U.S. Congress. Recommendation of the Public Land Commission for Legislation as to Private Land Claims, 46th Congress, 2nd Session, 1880, House Executive Document 46, pp. 1116‚Äì17. The U.S. also agreed to assume $3.25 million (equivalent to $ million today) in debts that Mexico owed to United States citizens. The residents had one year to choose whether they wanted American or Mexican citizenship; Over 90% chose American citizenship. The others returned to Mexico (where they received land), or in some cases in New Mexico were allowed to remain in place as Mexican citizens. Article XII engaged the United States to pay, \\"In consideration of the extension acquired\\", 15 million dollars (equivalent to $ million today), in annual installments of 3 million dollars. Article XI of the treaty was important to Mexico. It provided that the United States would prevent and punish raids by Indians into Mexico, prohibited Americans from acquiring property, including livestock, taken by the Indians in those raids, and stated that the U.S. would return captives of the Indians to Mexico. Mexicans believed that the United States had encouraged and assisted the Comanche and Apache raids that had devastated northern Mexico in the years before the war. This article promised relief to them. Article XI, however, proved unenforceable. Destructive Indian raids continued despite a heavy U.S. presence near the Mexican border. Mexico filed 366 claims with the U.S. government for damages done by Comanche and Apache raids between 1848 and 1853. In 1853, in the Treaty of Mesilla concluding the Gadsden Purchase, Article XI was annulled. = Results = The land that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo brought into the United States became, between 1850 and 1912, all or part of ten states: California (1850), Nevada (1864), Utah (1896), and Arizona (1912), as well as, depending upon interpretation, the entire state of Texas (1845), which then included part of Kansas (1861); Colorado (1876); Oklahoma (1907); and New Mexico (1912). The area of domain acquired was given by the Federal Interagency Committee as 338,680,960 acres. The cost was $16,295,149 or approximately 5 cents an acre. The remainder (the southern parts) of New Mexico and Arizona were peacefully purchased under the Gadsden Purchase, which was carried out in 1853. In this purchase the United States paid an additional $10 million (equivalent to $ million in ), for land intended to accommodate a transcontinental railroad. However, the American Civil War delayed construction of such a route, and it was not until 1881 that the Southern Pacific Railroad finally was completed as a second transcontinental railroad, fulfilling the purpose of the acquisition.  Background to the war  Mexico had claimed the area in question since winning its independence from the Spanish Empire in 1821 following the Mexican War of Independence. The Spanish had conquered part of the area from the American Indian tribes over the preceding three centuries, but there remained powerful and independent indigenous nations within that northern region of Mexico. Most of that land was too dry (low rainfall) and too mountainous to support many people, until the advent of new technology after about 1880: means for damming and distributing water from the few rivers to irrigated farmland; the telegraph; the railroad; the telephone; and electrical power. About 80,000 Mexicans inhabited California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas during the period 1845 to 1850, with far fewer in Nevada, southern and western Colorado, and Utah. On 1 March 1845, U.S. President John Tyler signed legislation to authorize the United States to annex the Republic of Texas, effective on 29 December 1845. The Mexican government, which had never recognized the Republic of Texas as an independent country, had warned that annexation would be viewed as an act of war. The United Kingdom and France, both of which recognized the independence of the Republic of Texas, repeatedly tried to dissuade Mexico from declaring war against its northern neighbor. British efforts to mediate the quandary proved fruitless, in part because additional political disputes (particularly the Oregon boundary dispute) arose between Great Britain (as the claimant of modern Canada) and the United States. On 10 November 1845, before the outbreak of hostilities, President James K. Polk sent his envoy, John Slidell, to Mexico. Slidell had instructions to offer Mexico around $5 million for the territory of Nuevo M√©xico and up to $40 million for Alta California.Mills, B. 2003. U.S.-Mexican War. Facts On File, p. 23. The Mexican government dismissed Slidell, refusing to even meet with him. Earlier in that year, Mexico had broken off diplomatic relations with the United States, based partly on its interpretation of the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty of 1819, under which newly independent Mexico claimed it had inherited rights. In that agreement, the United States had \\"renounced forever\\" all claims to Spanish territory.Adams-Onis Treaty, Article III. From: yale.edu. Retrieved 6 November 2007.\\"The United States hereby cede to His Catholic Majesty, and renounce forever, all their rights, claims, and pretensions to the Territories lying West and South of the above described Line [...]. http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/adamonis.htm Neither side took any further action to avoid a war. Meanwhile, Polk settled a major territorial dispute with Britain via the Oregon Treaty, which was signed on 15 June 1846. By avoiding any chance of conflict with Great Britain, the U.S was given a free hand in regard to Mexico. After the Thornton Affair of 25‚Äì26 April, when Mexican forces attacked an American unit in the disputed area, with the result that 11 Americans were killed, five wounded and 49 captured, Congress passed declaration of war, which Polk signed on 13 May 1846. The Mexican Congress responded with its own war declaration on 7 July 1846. Conduct of war  Map o. S. Augustus Mitchell, Philadelphia, 1847. Alta California shown including Nevada, Utah, Arizona. U.S. forces moved quickly far beyond Texas to conquer Alta California and New Mexico. Fighting there ended on 13 January 1847 with the signing of the \\"Capitulation Agreement\\" at \\"Campo de Cahuenga\\" and end of the Taos Revolt.Original Capitulation Agreement document (one of 25) on view at Campo de Cahuenga historical site By the middle of September 1847, U.S. forces had successfully invaded central Mexico and occupied Mexico City. = Peace negotiations = Some Eastern Democrats called for complete annexation of Mexico and claimed that some Mexican liberals would welcome this,\\"Mexican Argument for Annexation.\\" The Living Age, Volume 10, Issue 123. 19 September 1846. but President Polk's State of the Union address in December 1847 upheld Mexican independence and argued at length that occupation and any further military operations in Mexico were aimed at securing a treaty ceding California and New Mexico up to approximately the 32nd parallel north and possibly Baja California and transit rights across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Despite its lengthy string of military defeats, the Mexican government was reluctant to agree to the loss of California and New Mexico. Even with its capital under enemy occupation, the Mexican government was inclined to consider factors such as the unwillingness of the U.S. administration to annex Mexico outright and what appeared to be deep divisions in domestic U.S. opinion regarding the war and its aims, which gave it reason to conclude that it was actually in a far better negotiating position than the military situation might have suggested. A further consideration was the Mexican government's opposition to slavery and its awareness of the well-known and growing sectional divide in the U.S. over the issue of slavery. It therefore made sense for Mexico to negotiate with a goal of pandering to Northern U.S. interests at the expense of Southern U.S. interests. The Mexicans proposed peace terms that offered only sale of Alta California north of the 37th parallel north ‚Äî north of Santa Cruz, California and Madera, California and the southern boundaries of today's Utah and Colorado. This territory was already dominated by Anglo-American settlers, but perhaps more importantly from the Mexican point of view, it represented the bulk of pre-war Mexican territory north of the Missouri Compromise line of parallel 36¬∞30‚Ä≤ north ‚Äî lands that, if annexed by the U.S., would have been presumed by Northerners to be forever free of slavery. The Mexicans also offered to recognize the U.S. annexation of Texas, but held to its demand of the Nueces River as a boundary. While the Mexican government could not reasonably have expected the Polk Administration to accept such terms, it would have had reason to hope that a rejection of peace terms so favorable to Northern interests might have the potential to provoke sectional conflict in the United States, or perhaps even a civil war that would fatally undermine the U.S. military position in Mexico. Instead, these terms combined with other Mexican demands (in particular, for various indemnities) only provoked widespread indignation throughout the U.S. without causing the sectional conflict the Mexicans were hoping for. Jefferson Davis advised Polk that if Mexico appointed commissioners to come to the U.S., the government that appointed them would probably be overthrown before they completed their mission, and they would likely be shot as traitors on their return; so that the only hope of peace was to have a U.S. representative in Mexico. Nicholas Trist, chief clerk of the State Department under President Polk, finally negotiated a treaty with the Mexican delegation after ignoring his recall by President Polk in frustration with failure to secure a treaty.Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. National Archives. Retrieved 6 November 2007. Notwithstanding that the treaty had been negotiated against his instructions, given its achievement of the major American aim, President Polk passed it on to the Senate. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed by Nicholas Trist (on behalf of the U.S.) and Luis G. Cuevas, Bernardo Couto and Miguel Atristain as plenipotentiary representatives of Mexico on 2 February 1848, at the main altar of the old Basilica of Guadalupe at Villa Hidalgo (within the present city limits) as U.S. troops under the command of Gen.

Article VIII guaranteed that Mexicans who remained more than one year in the ceded lands would automatically become full-fledged United States citizens (or they could declare their intention of remaining Mexican citizens); however, the Senate modified Article IX, changing the first paragraph and excluding the last two. Among the changes was that Mexican citizens would \\"be admitted at the proper time (to be judged of by the Congress of the United States)\\" instead of \\"admitted as soon as possible\\", as negotiated between Trist and the Mexican delegation.

Dickinson of New York, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana, and one each from Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Ohio, Missouri and Tennessee. Most of the leaders of the Democratic party, Thomas Hart Benton, John C. Calhoun, Herschel V. Johnson, Lewis Cass, James Murray Mason of Virginia and Ambrose Hundley Sevier were opposed and the amendment was defeated 44‚Äì11. An amendment by Whig Sen. George Edmund Badger of North Carolina to exclude New Mexico and California lost 35‚Äì15, with three Southern Whigs voting with the Democrats. Daniel Webster was bitter that four New England senators made deciding votes for acquiring the new territories. A motion to insert into the treaty the Wilmot Proviso (banning slavery from the acquired territories) failed 15‚Äì38 on sectional lines. The treaty was subsequently ratified by the U.S. Senate by a vote of 38 to 14 on 10 March 1848 and by Mexico through a legislative vote of 51 to 34 and a Senate vote of 33 to 4, on 19 May 1848. News that New Mexico's legislative assembly had just passed an act for organization of a U.S. territorial government helped ease Mexican concern about abandoning the people of New Mexico. The treaty was formally proclaimed on 4 July 1848. = Protocol of Quer√©taro = On 30 May 1848, when the two countries exchanged ratifications of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, they further negotiated a three-article protocol to explain the amendments. The first article stated that the original Article IX of the treaty, although replaced by Article III of the Treaty of Louisiana, would still confer the rights delineated in Article IX. The second article confirmed the legitimacy of land grants pursuant to Mexican law.Treaty of Hidalgo, Protocol of Quer√©taro. From: academic.udayton.edu. Retrieved 6 November 2007. The protocol further noted that said explanations had been accepted by the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Mexican Government, and was signed in Santiago de Quer√©taro by A. H. Sevier, Nathan Clifford and Luis de la Rosa. The U.S. would later go on to ignore the protocol on the grounds that the U.S. representatives had over-reached their authority in agreeing to it.David Hunter Miller, Treaties and Other International Acts of the United States of America, vol. 5 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1937) = Treaty of Mesilla = The Treaty of Mesilla, which concluded the Gadsden purchase of 1854, had significant implications for the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article II of the treaty annulled article XI of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and article IV further annulled articles VI and VII of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Article V however reaffirmed the property guarantees of Guadalupe Hidalgo, specifically those contained within articles VIII and IX.Mills, B. p. 122.  Effects  The Mexican Cession agreed with Mexico (white) and the Gadsden Purchase (brown). Part of the area marked as Gadsden Purchase near modern-day Mesilla, New Mexico, was disputed after the Treaty. In addition to the sale of land, the treaty also provided for the recognition of the Rio Grande as the boundary between the state of Texas and Mexico.Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Article V. From: academic.udayton.edu. Retrieved 7 November 2007. The land boundaries were established by a survey team of appointed Mexican and American representatives, and published in three volumes as The United States and Mexican Boundary Survey. On 30 December 1853, the countries by agreement altered the border from the initial one by increasing the number of border markers from 6 to 53. Most of these markers were simply piles of stones. Two later conventions, in 1882 and 1889, further clarified the boundaries, as some of the markers had been moved or destroyed. Photographers were brought in to document the location of the markers. These photographs are in Record Group 77, Records of the Office of the Chief Engineers, in the National Archives. The southern border of California was designated as a line from the junction of the Colorado and Gila rivers westward to the Pacific Ocean, so that it passes one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of San Diego Bay. This was done to ensure that the United States received San Diego and its excellent natural harbor, without relying on potentially inaccurate designations by latitude. The treaty extended the choice of U.S. citizenship to Mexicans in the newly purchased territories, before many African Americans, Asians and Native Americans were eligible. If they chose to, they had to declare to the U.S. government within a year the Treaty was signed; otherwise, they could remain Mexican citizens, but they would have to relocate. Between 1850 and 1920, the U.S. Census counted most Mexicans as racially \\"white\\".Gibson, C.J. and E. Lennon. 1999. \\"Historical Census Statistics on the Foreign-born Population of the United States: 1850‚Äì1990.\\" U.S. Census Bureau, Population Division. Retrieved 6 November 2007. Nonetheless, racially tinged tensions persisted in the era following annexation, reflected in such things as the Greaser Act in California, as tens of thousands of Mexican nationals suddenly found themselves living within the borders of the United States. Mexican communities remained segregated de facto from and also within other U.S. communities, continuing through the Mexican migration right up to the end of the 20th century throughout the Southwest. Community property rights in California are a legacy of the Mexican era. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be kept inviolate. The early Californians felt compelled to continue the community property system regarding the earnings and accumulation of property during a marriage, and it became incorporated into the California constitution.Cali. Const. art. XX, ¬ß 7. = Land Gained by the United States = The US received some or all of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming from the treaty. = Additional issues = Border disputes continued. The desire to expand the territory of the United States continued unabated and Mexico's economic problems persisted,The U.S.-Mexico Border: The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, John C. Davenport, p. 60, . leading to the controversial Gadsden Purchase in 1854 and William Walker's Republic of Lower California filibustering incident in that same year. The Channel Islands of California and Farallon Islands are not mentioned in the Treaty. The border was routinely crossed by the armed forces of both countries. Mexican and Confederate troops often clashed during the American Civil War, and the U.S. crossed the border during the war of French intervention in Mexico. In March 1916 Pancho Villa led a raid on the U.S. border town of Columbus, New Mexico, which was followed by the Pershing expedition. The shifting of the Rio Grande since the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe caused a dispute over the boundary between the states of New Mexico and Texas, a case referred to as the Country Club Dispute that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1927. Controversy over community land grant claims in New Mexico persists to this day. Disputes about whether to make all this new territory into free states or slave-holding states contributed heavily to the rise in north‚Äìsouth tensions that led to the American Civil War just over a decade later. The treaty was leaked to John Nugent before the U.S. Senate could approve it. Nugent published his article in the New York Herald and, afterward, was questioned by Senators. He was detained in a Senate committee room for one month, though he continued to file articles for his newspaper and ate and slept at the home of the sergeant of arms. Nugent did not reveal his source, and senators eventually gave up their efforts. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo led to the establishment in 1889 of the International Boundary and Water Commission to maintain the border, and pursuant to newer treaties to allocate river waters between the two nations, and to provide for flood control and water sanitation. Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues.Robert J. McCarthy, Executive Authority, Adaptive Treaty Interpretation, and the International Boundary and Water Commission, U.S.-Mexico, 14-2 U. Denv. Water L.

He is best remembered for representing Chelsea and Southampton at club level, and was also capped four times by England in the early 1970s.  Personal life Osgood was born at 26 East Crescent, Clewer, Windsor, Berkshire to Leslie Frank Herbert and Ivy Lilian (n√©e Comley). He attended Clewer Green primary school in Hatch Lane, Windsor, and Dedworth secondary modern school. Osgood described himself as a tear away and as not the brainiest kid at school (although he was captain at most sports) and was working as a bricklayer and playing football for Windsor when his uncle wrote to Chelsea on his behalf to secure a trial. Osgood was married three times: *to Rosemary Heather Snow on 19 December 1964, with whom he had two children, Anthony and Mark. They married in Windsor Registry Office on a wintry Saturday morning. On the same afternoon he played for Chelsea against Peterborough, scoring a hat-trick in a 6‚Äì1 victory. *to Philippa Cooke-Smith on 17 October 1980. *to Lynette Ann Finlay on 1 June 1987, with whom he had one son, Darren. Playing career=Chelsea= Osgood had had a previous trial with Arsenal, but said that he tore the papers up because he was happy playing for Windsor and working on building sites, and didn't fancy the travel. Osgood was signed in February 1964 by Chelsea as a junior and made his debut as a 17-year-old in the League Cup, scoring both goals in a 2‚Äì0 win against Workington AFC on 16 December 1964. The buzz surrounding the tall, skilful teenager's goalscoring for the club's reserves ‚Äì 30 goals in 20 games going into that month ‚Äì was already immense, and he soon became a regular first-teamer. Following an end-of-season tour of Australia during which Osgood scored 12 times in eight games, the centre-forward's next senior match was the 22 September 1965 4‚Äì1 victory over AS Roma in the Inter- City Fairs Cup (a violent encounter dubbed \\"the Battle of the Bridge\\"). A run in the league followed, bringing seven goals, including one involving a 60-yard run past a number of Burnley players. The teenager was soon hailed as a possible late call-up for Alf Ramsey's 1966 World Cup squad, having been included in the original 40-man squad announced in April 1966, but he was not included in the final 22. A broken leg suffered in a challenge by Blackpool's Emlyn Hughes in the League Cup on 5 October 1966 seriously curtailed his progress, and he missed Chelsea's first-ever Wembley FA Cup final on 20 May 1967. Chelsea lost to Tottenham Hotspur 1‚Äì2. This was a major disappointment for Osgood, but after he returned from the injury his abilities were recognised by new manager Dave Sexton playing him often as a midfielder, notably wearing the number 4 shirt for most of the 1968‚Äì 69 season (reference page 70 'Ossie ‚Äì King of Stamford Bridge' written with Martin Knight and Martin King ), but it is as a goalscoring centre-forward, number 9, that he is best remembered. He was given the nickname \\"the Wizard of Os\\". In total, Osgood made 289 appearances for The Blues, scoring 105 goals. He was one of only nine players to score in every round of the FA Cup (and, to date, the last to do so), helping Chelsea to victory in a replayed final against Leeds United in 1970. He scored Chelsea's equaliser in the second game at Old Trafford with a diving header from Charlie Cooke's chipped pass twelve minutes from full-time; his side eventually won 2‚Äì1. In 1971, Osgood was part of the Chelsea team which lifted the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Real Madrid 2‚Äì1 in a replay in Athens after the original tie had finished 1‚Äì1, with Osgood scoring Chelsea's goal in that game. In the replay he scored again, the second goal to put Chelsea 2‚Äì0 up, as they went on to win 2‚Äì1. In 1972, he scored for Chelsea in a major cup final for the third consecutive year ‚Äì this time the League Cup ‚Äì though they lost 1‚Äì2 to Stoke City. Chelsea declined as a major force thereafter, but Osgood continued to score regularly; his volley from outside the area against Arsenal in the FA Cup quarter-final was voted BBC goal of the season in 1972‚Äì73. As a young player in the 1960s, Osgood enjoyed the trappings of fame, boozy nights out, gambling and owned a racing greyhound called Railroad Billy. =Southampton, Norwich and return to Chelsea= Following a series of disagreements with manager Dave Sexton over his lifestyle (during which supporters picketed Stamford Bridge to demand he stay) Osgood, along with several of his teammates, was dropped from the squad and placed on the transfer list. He was sold to Southampton in March 1974 for a club-record ¬£275,000. During his time on the south coast, he won the FA Cup again in 1976 after a 1‚Äì0 victory over Manchester United. He left Southampton in November 1977, shortly before the club were promoted. He scored 36 goals in 161 games for the Saints. Towards the end of his career, he also had a brief loan spell at Norwich City. Osgood returned to Chelsea in December 1978 following a disappointing stint in the United States with the Philadelphia Fury, where he scored only one goal in 23 matches for a team which also included Alan Ball and Johnny Giles. On his return to Stamford Bridge, the club were in deep decline and facing a relegation battle. He again scored on his debut to put his team ahead, though Chelsea still lost 7‚Äì2 to Middlesbrough. He stayed with the club for the rest of the season before retiring in December 1979. =England= In spite of his talent and goalscoring prowess, Osgood's England career was surprisingly limited, with England manager Alf Ramsey apparently disapproving of his playboy lifestyle. As a result, he only won four international caps, without scoring. Osgood made his England debut in February 1970 in a 3‚Äì1 win over Belgium. He was a member of the 1970 World Cup squad, making two appearances against Czechoslovakia and Romania as a substitute. Retirement After football Osgood's life never lacked incident. For a time in the early 1980s he ran a pub in Windsor, the Union Inn, with his old strike partner Ian Hutchinson but it was an ill- starred venture. As one of its favourite sons he was dismayed to be banned from Stamford Bridge, along with many of his 1970s colleagues, by chairman Ken Bates for perceived criticism of the club in the 1990s. In 2003, he was grateful to the Abramovich regime for his rehabilitation, and returned to his role as a hospitality host on matchdays. Osgood was commonly called \\"Ossie\\" and also earned the nickname \\"The King of Stamford Bridge\\" due to his exceptional skills as a player as well as his personality and status. To this day, Peter Osgood's status in the London club is unrivalled. His autobiography 'Ossie ‚Äì King of Stamford Bridge' written with Martin Knight and Martin King was released in 2003 and in 2004 Osgood appeared in a cameo role in the British film The Football Factory. Prior to his death on 1 March 2006 following a heart attack at a family funeral, he was involved in football related media work and was well known on the after dinner speaker circuit. Three weeks before his death he had enjoyed a standing ovation when presented to the Stamford Bridge crowd at half-time of a match. At Chelsea's first home game after Osgood's death, against local rivals Tottenham, there were many tributes as well as a minute's applause. Many of his former teammates were in attendance and the matchday programme ran a tribute to him. The atmosphere was one of joyous remembrance, and Chelsea ran out 2‚Äì1 winners after a last minute goal by William Gallas. Fans sang the chant in honour of Osgood to the tune of 'The First Noel'. In a memorial service on Sunday, 1 October 2006, Peter Osgood's ashes were buried under the penalty spot at the Shed End of Stamford Bridge. Over 2700 fans attended the memorial service and they were joined by former managers, chairmen, players, colleagues and current Chelsea players. In December 2007 in a 4‚Äì4 draw against Aston Villa, Andriy Shevchenko scored the first penalty kick at the Shed End since Osgood's ashes were buried there. On 24 September 2010, Chelsea revealed that the Peter Osgood statue had been completed and it was to be situated outside the West Stand. A week later there was a private unveiling of the statue, attended by Osgood's friends and family, and a day later the statue was available for public viewing.

She Stoops to Conquer is a comedy by Oliver Goldsmith, first performed in London in 1773. The play is a favourite for study by English literature and theatre classes in the English-speaking world. It is one of the few plays from the 18th century to have retained its appeal and is regularly performed. The play has been adapted into a film several times, including in 1914 and 1923. Initially the play was titled Mistakes of a Night and the events within the play take place in one long night. In 1778, John O'Keeffe wrote a loose sequel, Tony Lumpkin in Town. Plot=Act I= Act I begins at the Hardcastles‚Äô home in the countryside. Mrs. Hardcastle complains to her husband that they never leave their rural home to see the new things happening in the city. Hardcastle says he loves everything old, including his old wife. Mrs. Hardcastle says she was a young woman when she had her first husband‚Äôs son, Tony, and he is not yet twenty-one. Hardcastle complains about Tony‚Äôs immaturity and love of pranks. Tony enters on his way to a pub, and his mother follows him offstage, begging him to stay and spend time with them. Hardcastle‚Äôs daughter Kate enters. He remarks on her fashionable clothing, which he dislikes. Kate reminds him of their deal: she wears what she likes in the morning and dresses in the old-fashioned style he prefers at night. Hardcastle reveals big news: his friend Sir Charles‚Äôs son, Marlow, is coming to visit, and Hardcastle hopes Kate and Marlow will marry. Hardcastle says Marlow has a reputation for being handsome, intelligent and very modest. Kate likes all but the last part of this description and resolves to try to make a good impression on Marlow. Hardcastle exits, leaving Kate to think over her visitor. She is joined by her cousin Constance, whom she tells about Marlow‚Äôs impending visit. Constance tells her that she knows Marlow: he is the best friend of her suitor, Hastings. The odd thing about Marlow is that he is terribly shy around upper-class women, and therefore often seduces lower-class women instead. Mrs. Hardcastle wants Constance to marry her cousin, Tony, so that Constance‚Äôs inherited jewels stay in the family. Constance tells Kate that she pretends to be willing to marry Tony so that Mrs. Hardcastle won‚Äôt suspect she loves Hastings. Luckily for Constance, Tony doesn‚Äôt want to marry Constance any more than she wants to marry him. =Act II= The scene changes to a bar, where Tony is drinking with a group of lower-class men. The bar‚Äôs owner says that two fashionable-looking men have arrived who say they are looking for Mr. Hardcastle‚Äôs house. Tony realizes that this must be Marlow and decides to trick Marlow into believing Hardcastle‚Äôs house is an inn. Act II begins with Hardcastle trying to teach his servants how to behave in front of his guests. Soon after, Marlow and Hastings arrive at what they believe to be an inn. Hardcastle enters and tries to engage his guests in conversation, but the two young men ignore what he says, believing him to be a lowly innkeeper. Hardcastle is shocked by their rude, presumptuous treatment of him. Marlow insists on being shown his room, so Hardcastle accompanies him. When Hastings is left alone, Constance enters. Upon hearing that Hastings believes he is in an inn, she guesses it is a trick of Tony‚Äôs. Hastings says that they should keep Marlow‚Äôs mistake from him, because he will be embarrassed and leave immediately if he learns the truth. Hastings urges Constance to elope with him, but she is reluctant to lose her fortune: the jewels, which she will only inherit if she marries with her aunt‚Äôs permission. She promises to run away with him once she has the jewels. Marlow returns, complaining that Hardcastle will not leave him alone. Hastings tells Marlow that by coincidence, Constance and her cousin Kate are both at this inn. Marlow freezes in anxiety. Kate enters and tries to engage Marlow in conversation, but once Hastings and Constance leave Kate and Marlow alone, Marlow is too nervous to complete his sentences or even look at Kate‚Äôs face. He ends the conversation abruptly and rushes off. Before exiting the stage, Kate reflects to herself that, if he weren‚Äôt so shy, she would be interested in him. Tony and Constance enter, followed by Hastings and Mrs. Hardcastle. Constance makes a show of flirting with Tony for Mrs. Hardcastle, while he tries to repel her advances. Hastings chats with Mrs. Hardcastle, points out Constance and Tony, saying that they are betrothed. Tony objects to this loudly. Hastings tells Mrs. Hardcastle that he will try to talk some sense into Tony, and Constance and Mrs. Hardcastle exit. Hastings reveals to Tony that he loves Constance and wants to elope with her. Tony is thrilled and promises to help the couple any way he can. =Act III= Act III begins with Hardcastle and Kate comparing their very different impressions of Marlow. He expresses shock at Marlow‚Äôs boldness, while she finds him incredibly shy. Kate convinces her father that they should give Marlow another chance to see what his true character is. Tony presents Hastings with a box containing Constance‚Äôs jewels, which he stole from his mother‚Äôs drawers. Constance and Mrs. Hardcastle enter, and Hastings exits. Constance tries to convince her aunt to let her try on her jewels, but Mrs. Hardcastle will not relent. Tony suggests that Mrs. Hardcastle tell Constance the jewels are missing, which she does, upsetting Constance deeply. Tony reassures Constance privately, telling her that he gave her jewels to Hastings, who is preparing for their elopement. Meanwhile, Mrs. Hardcastle has discovered the jewels are missing. Tony teases his distressed mother, and the two of them exit. Kate enters accompanied by her maid Pimple and wearing the old-fashioned dress her father prefers. She has learned about Tony‚Äôs prank and laughs at Marlow‚Äôs belief that he is in an inn. Pimple says that Marlow mistook Kate for the inn‚Äôs barmaid. Kate says she will take advantage of the mistake, which will enable him to talk to her without such shyness. Pimple exits, and Marlow enters. Kate, pretending to be a maid, speaks to Marlow in the accent of a lower-class woman. Marlow finds her beautiful and immediately begins to flirt with her. He tries to kiss her, but Hardcastle walks into the room and sees them. Marlow flees the room, and Hardcastle tells Kate he is determined to throw Marlow out of his house. Kate persuades her father to give her time to prove to him that Marlow is not what he seems. =Act IV= Act IV begins with Constance and Hastings planning their elopement. Constance tells Hastings that she has heard Sir Charles will soon be arriving, and Hastings tells Constance that he has entrusted her box of jewels to Marlow to keep them safe. They both exit. Marlow enters, congratulating himself on thinking to give the box of jewels to the landlady (i.e., Mrs. Hardcastle) to keep it safe. Hastings enters, and Marlow tells him he stashed the jewels securely with the landlady. Hastings conceals his disappointment that Mrs. Hardcastle has the jewels back and leaves. Hardcastle enters and begins to argue with Marlow, whose servants have gotten drunk. Storming away, Hardcastle says he would never have predicted such rudeness from Sir Charles‚Äôs son. Marlow is confused by this remark, but at that moment, Kate enters. Marlow, beginning to understand something is amiss, asks Kate where they are, and she tells him that they are at Mr. Hardcastle‚Äôs house. Marlow is horrified at his error. Kate does not yet reveal her true identity, pretending instead to be a poor relation of the family. Marlow announces his departure, and Kate weeps at the news. He is touched to see how much she cares about him. Tony and Constance discuss her plan to elope with Hastings, even without the jewels. Mrs. Hardcastle enters and the two cousins pretend to flirt so she won‚Äôt suspect the planned elopement. A letter comes from Hastings addressed to Tony, but because Tony cannot read, his mother reads it to him. The letter reveals the plan for the elopement. Mrs. Hardcastle is furious and tells Constance she is sending her far away to Aunt Pedigree‚Äôs house. Hastings enters and yells at Tony for giving away the secret. Marlow enters and yells at both Tony and Hastings for deceiving him about where he is. Constance is utterly distraught and begs Hastings to stay faithful to her even if they have to wait several years to marry. After Constance leaves, Tony tells Hastings to meet him in the garden in two hours, promising to make it all up to him. =Act V= In Act V, Hardcastle and the newly arrived Sir Charles laugh over Marlow‚Äôs having mistaken the home for an inn. Hardcastle says that he saw Marlow take Kate‚Äôs hand and he thinks they will marry. Marlow enters and formally apologizes to Hardcastle. Hardcastle says it doesn‚Äôt matter, since Marlow and Kate will soon marry, but Marlow denies having feelings for Kate. When Hardcastle refuses to believe him, Marlow storms out. Kate enters and assures the two fathers that Marlow likes her. She tells the two fathers to hide behind a screen in half an hour to see proof of Marlow‚Äôs feelings. Out in the garden, Tony arrives and tells Hastings that he has driven his mother and Constance in a circle instead of taking them to Aunt Pedigree‚Äôs house. Mrs. Hardcastle is terrified, thinking they are lost in dangerous territory. Hastings rushes off to find Constance. Elsewhere in the garden, Hastings tries to convince Constance to elope with him. She says she is too exhausted from the stress of the night to run off. Instead she wants to explain their situation to Hardcastle and hope that he can influence his wife to allow their marriage. Inside the house, Hardcastle and Sir Charles hide behind a screen and watch Marlow and Kate talk. Kate no longer pretends to be a barmaid, but speaks in her normal voice. Marlow says he wishes he could stay with her, but he does not want to disappoint his family by marrying someone of lower birth. Kate tells him she has the same background as the woman he came to see. Marlow kneels before her, and the two fathers burst out from behind the screen, asking why he lied to them about his feelings for Kate. Marlow learns Kate‚Äôs true identity and is embarrassed again at having been so deceived. Mrs. Hardcastle and Tony enter (Mrs. Hardcastle having realized where she is). Mrs. Hardcastle says that Constance and Hastings have run off together, but she is consoled by the fact that she will get to keep Constance‚Äôs jewels. At that moment, however, Hastings and Constance enter. Sir Charles recognizes Hastings and tells Hardcastle that he is a good man. Hardcastle asks Tony if he is really sure that he doesn‚Äôt want to marry his cousin. Tony says he is sure, but that it doesn‚Äôt matter, since he cannot formally refuse to marry Constance until he is twenty-one. Hardcastle then reveals that Mrs. Hardcastle has been hiding the fact that Tony is in fact already twenty-one. At this, Tony says he will not marry Constance, freeing her to marry Hastings and keep her fortune. Everyone except Mrs. Hardcastle is thrilled that the two young couples ‚Äì Hastings and Constance, and Marlow and Kate ‚Äì will marry.

An incident in a nearby house in Leverington may have been the basis of the play. Goldsmith is supposed to have visited his friends the Lumpkins at their home Parkfield, Leverington. Lumpkin moved to Wisbech later and this play was very popular in the local theatre.{{Handbills in the Wisbech & Fenland Museum collection of over 200 items) Perhaps one of the most famous modern incarnations of She Stoops to Conquer was Peter Hall's version, staged in 1993 and starring Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Hardcastle. The most famous TV production is the 1971 version featuring Ralph Richardson, Tom Courtenay, Juliet Mills, and Brian Cox, with Trevor Peacock as Tony Lumpkin. Courtenay, Mills and Peacock also performed in this play at The Garrick Theatre, London, in 1969. The 1971 version was shot on location near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, and is part of the BBC archive. This play was one of 13 BBC productions that formed the series called Classic Theatre, the Humanities in Drama. The series was funded in the U.S. by the N.E.H. and used as a study aid on video tape by thousands of U.S. students. In 2008 the play was again produced in Wisbech. The story goes that Oliver Goldsmith wrote the play while staying with the Lumpkin family at Park House in Leverington, near Wisbech and that he lampooned his friend, Nicholas Lumpkin, by turning him into his famous creation, Tony Lumpkin. The real Lumpkin moved to Wisbech after his money ran out. Type of comedy When the play was first produced, it was discussed as an example of the revival of laughing comedy over the sentimental comedy seen as dominant on the English stage since the success of The Conscious Lovers, written by Sir Richard Steele in 1722. An essay published in a London magazine in 1773, entitled \\"An Essay on the Theatre; Or, A Comparison between Laughing And Sentimental Comedy\\", argued that sentimental comedy, a false form of comedy, had taken over the boards from the older and more truly comic laughing comedy. Some theatre historians believe the essay was written by Goldsmith as a puff piece for She Stoops to Conquer as an exemplar of the \\"laughing comedy\\". Goldsmith's name was linked with that of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, author of The Rivals and The School for Scandal, as standard-bearers for the resurgent laughing comedy. The play might also be seen as a comedy of manners in which the comedy arises from the gap between the standards of behaviour the characters regard as proper in polite society, and the more informal behaviours they are prepared to indulge or deploy in settings they deem less constrained by such standards. Kate's stooping and Marlow's nervousness are also examples of romantic comedy, as are Constance Neville's and George Hastings' love and plan to elope. Title The title refers to Kate's ruse of pretending to be a barmaid to reach her goal. It originates in the poetry of Dryden, which Goldsmith may have seen misquoted by Lord Chesterfield. In Chesterfield's version, the lines in question read: \\"The prostrate lover, when he lowest lies, But stoops to conquer, and but kneels to rise.\\" Characters *Charles Marlow ‚Äì The central male character, who has set out to court the young attractive Kate Hardcastle. A well-educated man, \\"bred a scholar\\", Marlow is brash and rude to Mr. Hardcastle, owner of \\"Liberty Hall\\" (a reference to another site in London), whom Marlow believes to be an innkeeper. Marlow is sophisticated and has travelled the world. Around working-class women Marlow is a lecherous rogue, but around those of an upper-class card he is a nervous, bumbling fool. *George Hastings ‚Äì Friend of Charles Marlow and the admirer of Miss Constance Neville. Hastings is an educated man who cares deeply about Constance, with the intention of fleeing to France with her. *Tony Lumpkin ‚Äì Son of Mrs Hardcastle and stepson to Mr Hardcastle, Tony is a mischievous, uneducated playboy. *Mr. Hardcastle ‚Äì The father of Kate Hardcastle but he is mistaken by Marlow and Hastings as an innkeeper. *Mrs. Hardcastle ‚Äì Wife to Mr. Hardcastle and mother to Tony, Mrs. Hardcastle is a corrupt and eccentric character. She is an over-protective mother to Tony, whom she loves, but fails to tell him he's of age so that he is eligible to receive ¬£1,500 a year. *Miss Kate Hardcastle ‚Äì Daughter to Mr. Hardcastle, and the play's stooping-to-conquer heroine. *Miss Constance Neville ‚Äì Niece of Mrs. Hardcastle, she is the woman whom Hastings intends to court. *Sir Charles Marlow ‚Äì A minor character and father of Charles Marlow; he follows his son, a few hours behind. Reception Goldsmith's friend and contemporary, Samuel Johnson greatly admired the play. James Boswell quoted him as saying, \\"I know of no comedy for many years that has so much exhilarated an audience that it has answered so much the great end of comedy ‚Äì making an audience merry\\". Adaptations There have been a number of film and television adaptations of the play over the years: *She Stoops to Conquer, a 1910 silent movie starring Anna Rosemond *She Stoops to Conquer, a 1914 silent movie directed by George Loane Tucker and starring Henry Ainley and Jane Gail *She Stoops to Conquer, a 1923 silent movie directed by Edwin Greenwood *She Stoops to Conquer, a 1939 adaptation for television starring Morris Harvey, Renee De Vaux and James Hayter *She Stoops to Conquer, a 1971 BBC television production starring Tom Courtenay, Juliet Mills, Ralph Richardson, Thora Hird, Trevor Peacock and Brian Cox *Soviet television play directed by Mikhail Kozakov in 1974 *The Kissing Dance, a musical by Howard Goodall and Charles Hart: 1998, for the National Youth Music Theatre of Britain *She Stoops to Conquer, a 2003 video presentation recorded live on stage in Bath, Somerset, England *She Stoops to Conquer, a 2008 television adaptation directed by Tony Britten and starring Tim Bell, Simon Butteriss, Judi Daykin and Mark Dexter The play was adapted as an opera by George Macfarren.

In its most recognizable form, venality causes people to lie and steal for their own personal advantage, and is related to bribery and nepotism, among other vices. Though not in line with dictionary definitions of the termhttps://onelook.com/?w=venal, modern writers often use it to connote vices only tangentially related to bribery or self-interest, such as cruelty, selfishness, and general dishonesty.  Context  Venality in its mild form is a vice notable especially among those with government or military careers. For example, the Ancien R√©gime in France from the 1500s through the late 1700s, was notorious for the venality of many government officials.Andrews, Richard Mowery (1994) Law, Magistracy, and Crime in Old Regime Paris, 1735-1789: Volume 1, The System of Criminal Justice, Cambridge University Press In these fields, one is ideally supposed to act with justice and honor and not accept bribes. That ensures that the organization is not susceptible to manipulation by self-interested parties. In contrast to the previous interpretation, dishonesty is not specifically expressed in the literal meaning, but is often implied. The condition of failing to act justly is not a literal component of the word's meaning either. By definition, committing \\"venal\\" acts does not indicate \\"stealing\\" or \\"lying\\", but rather suggests a consensual arrangement, perhaps without conscience or regard for consequences, but is not synonymous with stealing. While bribery could be related, nepotism clearly has no literal similarity or correlation with venality. Though venality is generally used as a pejorative term, an individual or entity could be venal (or mercenary) and not be corrupt or unethical. One could perform one's duties or job in a perfunctory manner in order to collect a wage or payment, or prostitute one's time or skills for monetary or material gain, without necessarily being dishonest. Much contemporary use of the words venal or venality is applied to modern professional athletes, particularly baseball, basketball, American football, and soccer players all around the world. The implication being that the highly paid players are essentially \\"hired guns\\" with no allegiance to any team or city, and are motivated solely by the acquisition of material wealth.  In revolution and other moral panics  For people to accept settlements and legislation, the acts of the government must be seen as just. This perception enhances the legitimacy of the government. Venality is a term often used with reference to pre-revolutionary France, where it describes the then-widespread practice of selling administrative positions within the government to the highest bidder, especially regarding the Nobles of the Robe. Thus, for example, venality was a charge for which, in part, Danton and others were executed during the Reign of Terror.

With the beginning of Islam in the 7th century and its rapid spread over the Arabian peninsula and beyond, Jews along with many other peoples became subject to the rule of Islamic states. The quality of the rule varied considerably in different periods, as did the attitudes of the rulers, government officials, clergy, and general population toward various subject peoples from time to time, which was reflected in their treatment of these subjects. According to Reuven Firestone, \\"negative assessments and even condemnation of prior religions and their adherents occur in all three scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.\\"Firestone, p. 188 Scholars have studied and debated Muslim attitudes toward, and treatment of, Jews in Islamic thought and societies throughout history. Range of opinions *Claude CahenClaude Cahen. \\"Dhimma\\" in Encyclopedia of Islam. and Shelomo Dov GoiteinShelomo Dov Goitein, A Mediterranean Society: An Abridgment in One Volume, p. 293. argue against historical antisemitism in Muslim countries, writing that the discrimination that was practiced against non-Muslims (Kuffar) was of a general nature, and it was not specifically targeted at Jews.The Oxford Dictionary of the Jewish Religion, \\"Antisemitism\\" According to these scholars, antisemitism in Medieval Islam was local and sporadic rather than general and endemic. *Bernard LewisLewis, Bernard. \\"The New Anti- Semitism\\", The American Scholar, Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, p. 25‚Äì36; based on a lecture delivered at Brandeis University on March 24, 2004. writes that while Muslims have held negative stereotypes regarding Jews throughout most of Islamic history, these stereotypes were different from those stereotypes which accompanied European antisemitism because, unlike Christians, Muslims viewed Jews as objects of ridicule, not fear. He argues that Muslims did not attribute \\"cosmic evil\\" to Jews.Lewis (1999) p. 192. In Lewis' view, it was only in the late 19th century that movements first appeared among Muslims that can be described as antisemitic in the European forms.Lewis (1984) p. 184 *Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that there are mostly negative references to Jews in the Quran and Hadith, and Islamic regimes treated Jews in degrading ways. Both the Jews and the Christians were subjected to the status of dhimmi. Schweitzer and Perry state that throughout much of history Christians treated Jews worse, saying that Jews in Christian lands were subjected to worse polemics, persecutions and massacres than Jews who lived under Muslim rule.Schweitzer, p. 266. *According to Walter Laqueur, the varying interpretations of the Quran are important for understanding Muslim attitudes toward Jews. Many Quranic verses preach tolerance towards the Jews; others make hostile remarks about them (which are similar to hostile remarks made against those who did not accept Islam). Muhammad interacted with Jews living in Arabia: he preached to them in hopes of conversion, he fought against and killed many Jews, while he made friends with other Jews. * For Martin Kramer, the idea that contemporary antisemitism by Muslims is authentically Islamic \\"touches on some truths, yet it misses many others\\" (see Antisemitism in the Arab world). Kramer believes that contemporary antisemitism is only partially due to Israeli policies, about which Muslims may have a deep sense of injustice and loss. Kramer attributes the primary causes of Muslim antisemitism to modern European ideologies, which have infected the Muslim world. The Quran on Jews in its historical setting The Quran makes forty-three specific references to the Bani IsrƒÅƒ´l (meaning \\"the Children of Israel\\"). The Arabic term Yah≈´d, denoting Jews, and Yah≈´di occur eleven times, and the verbal form hƒÅda (meaning \\"to be a Jew/Jewish\\") occurs ten times.Jews and Judaism, Encyclopedia of the Quran According to Khalid Dur√°n, the negative passages use Yah≈´d, while the positive references speak mainly of the Banƒ´ IsrƒÅ‚Äôƒ´l.Khalid Dur√°n, with Abdelwahab Hechichep, Children of Abraham: an introduction to Islam for Jews, American Jewish Committee/Harriet and Robert Heilbrunn Institute for International Interreligious Understanding, KTAV Publishing House, Inc., 2001 p. 112 In the Quran, Jews are not an ethnic group but a religious group, while Bani Israel were an ethnic group, and according to the Quran they weren't following Judaism. Jews are not mentioned at all in verses dating from the Meccan period.Stillman, Norman (2005). Antisemitism: A historical encyclopedia of prejudice and persecution. Vol. 1. pp. 356‚Äì61 According to Bernard Lewis, the coverage given to Jews is relatively insignificant.Lewis (1999) p. 127 The references in the Quran to Jews are interpreted in different ways. According to Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry, these references are \\"mostly negative\\". According to Tahir Abbas, the general references to Jews are favorable, with only those addressed to particular groups of Jews containing harsh criticisms.Abbas, pp. 178‚Äì179 According to Bernard Lewis and other scholars, the earliest verses of the Quran were largely sympathetic to Jews. Muhammad admired them as monotheists and saw them as natural adherents to the new faith, and Jewish practices helped model early Islamic behavior, such as midday prayer, prayers on Friday, Ramadan fasting (modelled after the Jewish Yom Kippur fast on the tenth of the month of Tishrei), and most famously the fact that until 623 AD Muslims prayed toward Jerusalem, not Mecca.Rodinson, p. 159 After his flight (al-hijra) from Mecca in 622 AD, Muhammad with his followers settled in Yathrib, subsequently renamed Medina al-Nabi ('City of the Prophet') where he managed to draw up a 'social contract',Ali Khan, 'Commentary on the Constitution of Medina', in Hisham M. Ramadan (ed.) Understanding Islamic law: from classical to contemporary, Rowman Altamira, 2006 pp. 205‚Äì210 widely referred to as the 'Constitution of Medina'.Michael Lecker, The \\"constitution of Medina\\": Mu·∏•ammad's first legal document, Studies in late antiquity and early Islam SLAEI vol.23, Darwin Press, 2004, passim This contract, known as the Leaf (·π£a·∏•ƒ´fa) upheld the peaceful coexistence between Muslims, Jews and Christians, defining them all, under given conditions, as constituting the Ummah, or \\"community\\" of that city, and granting the latter freedom of religious thought and practice.Pratt, p. 121, citing John Esposito, What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam, Oxford University Press, New York p. 73 Yathrib/Medina was not homogeneous. Alongside the 200 odd emigrants from Mecca (the MuhƒÅjir≈´n), who had followed Muhammad, its population consisted of the Faithful of Medina (An·π£ƒÅr, \\"the Helpers\\"), Arab Pagans, three Jewish tribes, and some Christians.Pratt, p. 122 The foundational 'constitution' sought to establish, for the first time in history according to Ali Khan, a formal agreement guaranteeing interfaith conviviality, albeit ringed with articles emphasizing strategic cooperation in the defense of the city. In paragraph 16 of this document, it states that: 'Those Jews who follow us are entitled to our aid and support so long as they shall not have wronged us or lent assistance (to any enemies) against us'. Paragraph 37 has it that 'To the Jews their own expenses and to the Muslims theirs. They shall help one another in the event of any attack on the people covered by this document. There shall be sincere friendship, exchange of good counsel, fair conduct and no treachery between them.'Rodinson, pp. 152‚Äì3 The three local Jewish tribes were the Banu Nadir, the Banu Qurayza, and the Banu Qaynuqa. While Muhammad clearly had no prejudice against them, and appears to have regarded his own message as substantially the same as that received by Jews on Sinai,Rodinson, p. 158 tribal politics, and Mohammad's deep frustration at Jewish refusals to accept his prophethood,According to Reuven Firestone, Muhammad expected the Jews of Medina to accept his prophethood since Jews were respected by Arabs as 'a wise and ancient community of monotheists with a long prophetic tradition'. This rejection was a major blow to his authority in Medina, and relations soon deteriorated: Firestone, p. 33 quickly led to a break with all three. The Banu Qaynuqa were expelled from Medina in 624 AD. In March 624 AD, Muslims led by Muhammad defeated the Meccans of the Banu Quraysh tribe in the Battle of Badr. Ibn Ishaq writes that a dispute broke out between the Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa (the allies of the Khazraj tribe) soon afterwards. When a Muslim woman visited a jeweler's shop in the Qaynuqa marketplace, she was pestered to uncover her hair. The goldsmith, a Jew, pinned her clothing such that, upon getting up, she was stripped naked. A Muslim man coming upon the resulting commotion killed the shopkeeper in retaliation. A mob of Jews from the Qaynuqa tribe then pounced on the Muslim man and killed him. This escalated to a chain of revenge killings, and enmity grew between Muslims and the Banu Qaynuqa.Guillaume 363, Stillman 122, ibn Kathir 2 Traditional Muslim sources view these episodes as a violation of the Constitution of Medina. Muhammad himself regarded this as casus belli. Western historians, however, do not find in these events the underlying reason for Muhammad's attack on the Qaynuqa.Watt (1956), p. 209. Fred Donner argues that Muhammad turned against the Qaynuqa because as artisans and traders, the latter were in close contact with Meccan merchants.Donner, Fred M.. \\"Muhammad's Political Consolidation in Arabia up to the Conquest of Mecca\\". Muslim World 69: 229‚Äì247, 1979. Weinsinck views the episodes cited by the Muslim historians used to justify their expulsion, such as a Jewish goldsmith humiliating a Muslim woman, as having no more than anecdotal value. He writes that the Jews had assumed a contentious attitude towards Muhammad, and as a group possessing substantial independent power, they posed a great danger. Wensinck thus concludes that Muhammad, strengthened by the victory at Badr, soon resolved to eliminate the Jewish opposition to himself.Wensinck, A. J. \\"Kaynuka, banu\\". Encyclopaedia of Islam Norman Stillman also believes that Muhammad decided to move against the Jews of Medina after being strengthened in the wake of the Battle of Badr.Stillman, Norman. The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book. Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1979. Muhammad then approached the Banu Qaynuqa, gathering them in the market place and warned them to stop their hostility lest they suffer the same fate that happened to the Quraish at Badr. He also told them to accept Islam saying he was a prophet sent by God as per their scriptures. The tribe responded by mocking Muhammad's followers for accepting him as a prophet and also mocked their victory at Badr saying the Quraish had no knowledge of war. They then warned him that if he ever fought with them, he will know that they were real men.Guillaume 363 This response was viewed as a declaration of war.Nomani 90-91, al-Mubarakpuri 239 Muhammad then besieged the Banu Qaynuqa Stillman 123 after which the tribe surrendered unconditionally and were later expelled from Medina.Guillaume 363, Stillman 123 In 625 AD, the Banu Nadir tribe was evicted from Medina after they attempted to assassinate Muhammad. Translated by Muhammad Aslam Qasmi. In 627, when the Quraysh and their allies besieged the city in the Battle of the Trench, the Qurayza initially tried to remain neutral but eventually entered into negotiations with the besieging army, violating the pact they had agreed to years earlier. Subsequently, the tribe was charged with treason and besieged by the Muslims commanded by Muhammad.Peterson, Muhammad: the prophet of God, p. 125-127.Ramadan, In the Footsteps of the Prophet, p. 140f. The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered and their men were beheaded.Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, vol. 1, p. 191.Brown, A New Introduction to Islam, p. 81.Lings, Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources, p. 229-233. The spoils of battle, including the enslaved women and children of the tribe, were divided up among the Islamic warriors that had participated in the siege and among the emigrees from Mecca who had hitherto depended on the help of the Muslims native to Medina. Although the Banu Qurayza never took up arms against Muhammad or the Muslims, they entered into negotiations with the invading army and violated the Constitution of Medina. However, Nuam ibn Masud was able to sow discord between the invading forces and Banu Qurayza, thus breaking down the negotiations.See e.g. Stillman, p. 13.Guillaume, p. 458f.Ramadan, p. 143. As a result, the direction of prayer was shifted towards Mecca from Jerusalem, and the most negative Quranic verses about Jews were set down after this time. According to Laqueur, conflicting statements about Jews in the Quran have affected Muslim attitudes towards Jews to this day, especially during periods of rising Islamic fundamentalism.Laqueur, p. 191 =Judaism in Islamic theology= According to Bernard Lewis, there is nothing in Muslim theology (with a single exception) that can be considered refutations of Judaism or ferocious anti-Jewish diatribes.Lewis (1999) p. 126 Lewis and Chanes suggest that, for a variety of reasons, Muslims were not antisemitic for the most part. The Quran, like Judaism, orders Muslims to profess strict monotheism. It also rejects the stories of Jewish deicide as a blasphemous absurdity, and other similar stories in the Gospels play no part in the Muslim educational system. The Quran does not present itself as a fulfillment of the Hebrew Bible but rather a restoration of its original message ‚Äì thus, no clash of interpretations between Judaism and Islam can arise.Lewis (1999), pp. 117‚Äì118Chanes, Jerome A (2004). Antisemitism. Santa Barbara: ABC-CLIO. pp. 41‚Äì5. In addition Lewis argues that the Quran lacks popular Western traditions of 'guilt and betrayal'.Lewis (1999) p. 122 Rosenblatt and Pinson suggest that the Quran teaches toleration of Judaism as a fellow monotheistic faith.Pinson; Rosenblatt (1946) pp. 112‚Äì119 Lewis adds that negative attributes ascribed to subject religions (in this case Judaism and Christianity) are usually expressed in religious and social terms, but only very rarely in ethnic or racial terms. However, this does sometimes occur. The language of abuse is often quite strong. It has been argued that the conventional Muslim epithets for Jews, apes, and Christians, pigs derive from Quranic usage. Lewis adduces three passages in the Quran (, , ) used to ground this view.Lewis, The Jews and Islam, pp. 33, 198 The interpretation of these 'enigmatic'Firestone, p. 242 n.8 passages in Islamic exegetics is highly complex, dealing as they do with infractions like breaking the Sabbath,.On 2:62, the reference is to Jewish Sabbath breakers. See the synthesis of commentaries in Mahmoud Ayoub, The Qur'an and Its Interpreters, SUNY Press, New York,1984, Vol. 1 pp. 108‚Äì116 According to Goitein, the idea of Jewish Sabbath breakers turning into apes may reflect the influence of Yemeni midrashim.Gerald R. Hawting, The idea of idolatry and the emergence of Islam: from polemic to history, Cambridge University Press, 1999 p. 105 n.45 Firestone notes that the Qurayza tribe itself is described in Muslim sources as using the trope of being turned into apes if one breaks the Sabbath to justify not exploiting the Sabbath in order to attack Mohammad, when they were under siege.Firestone, p. 37 According to Stillman, the Quran praises Moses, and depicts the Israelites as the recipients of divine favour. The Quran dedicates many verses to the glorification of Hebrew prophets, says Leon Poliakov.Poliakov (1974) pp. 27, 41‚Äì3 He quotes verse as an example, > We gave him Isaac and Jacob: all (three) guided: and before him, We guided > Noah, and among his progeny, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses, and Aaron: > thus do We reward those who do good: And Zakariya and John, and Jesus and > Elias: all in the ranks of the righteous: And Isma'il and Elisha, and Jonas, > and Lot: and to all We gave favour above the nations. =Islamic remarks on Jews= Leon Poliakov,Poliakov Walter Laqueur, and Jane Gerber,Gerber, p. 78 argue that passages in the Quran reproach Jews for their refusal to recognize Muhammad as a prophet of God. \\"The Quran is engaged mainly in dealing with the sinners among the Jews and the attack on them is shaped according to models that one encounters in the New Testament.\\"Uri Rubin, Encyclopedia of the Qur'an, Jews and Judaism The Muslim holy text defined the Arab and Muslim attitude towards Jews to this day, especially in the periods when Islamic fundamentalism was on the rise. Walter Laqueur states that the Quran and its interpreters have a great many conflicting things to say about the Jews. Jews are said to be treacherous and hypocritical and could never be friends with a Muslim. Frederick M. Schweitzer and Marvin Perry state that references to Jews in the Quran are mostly negative. The Quran states that wretchedness and baseness were stamped upon the Jews, and they were visited with wrath from Allah, that was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. And for their taking usury, which was prohibited for them, and because of their consuming people's wealth under false pretense, a painful punishment was prepared for them. The Quran requires their \\"abasement and poverty\\" in the form of the poll tax jizya. In his \\"wrath\\" God has \\"cursed\\" the Jews and will turn them into apes/monkeys and swine and idol worshipers because they are \\"infidels\\". According to Martin Kramer, the Quran speaks of Jews in a negative way and reports instances of Jewish treachery against the Islamic prophet Muhammad. However, Islam didn't hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes nor did it portray treachery as the embodiment of Jews in all times and places. The Quran also attests to Muhammad's amicable relations with Jews. While traditional religious supremacism played a role in the Islamic view of Jews, the same attitude applied to Christians and other non-Muslims. Islamic tradition regards Jews as a legitimate community of believers in God (called \\"people of the Book\\") legally entitled to sufferance. The Quran () clears Jews from the accusation of deicide, and states \\"they [Jews] killed him [Jesus] not\\". They also argue that the Jewish Bible has not been incorporated in the Islamic text, and \\"virtuous Muslims\\" are not contrasted with \\"stiff-necked, criminal Jews\\". The standard Quranic reference to Jews is the verse .Lewis (1999) p. 128 It says: > And when you said, 'Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy > Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - > green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions.' He said, 'Would you have in > exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt; you shall > have there that you demanded.' And abasement and poverty were pitched upon > them, and they were laden with the burden of God's anger; that, because they > had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, > because they disobeyed, and were transgressors. Surely they that believe, > and those of Jewry, and the Christians, and those Sabaeans, whoso believes > in God and the Last Day, and works righteousness -- their wage awaits them > with their Lord, and no fear shall be on them; neither shall they > sorrow.English translation of the Quran by Arberry. However, due to the Quran's timely process of story-telling, some scholars argue that all references to Jews or other groups within the Quran refers to only certain populations at a certain point in history. Also, the Quran praises some Jews in : \\"Those who believe, and the Jews, and the Sabi'un, and the Christians, who believe in God and the Last Day and do good, there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve.\\" The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, \\" ... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers.\\" (Quran ) In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the Jewish plots against him ended in failure.Lewis (1999), p. 120 According to Gerber, in numerous verses (; ; ; ; , , ; )Gerber, p. 91 the Quran accuses Jews of altering the Scripture. But the Quran differentiates between \\"good and bad\\" Jews, adding to the idea that the Jewish people or their religion itself are not the target of the story-telling process. Rubin claims the criticisms deal mainly \\"with the sinners among the Jews and the attack on them is shaped according to models that one encounters in the New Testament.\\" The Quran also speaks favorably of Jews. Though it also criticizes them for not being grateful for God's blessing on them, the harsh criticisms are only addressed towards a particular group of Jews, which is clear from the context of the Quranic verses, but translations usually confuse this by using the general term \\"Jews\\". To judge Jews based on the deeds of some of their ancestors is an anti-Quranic idea. Ali S. Asani suggests that the Quran endorses the establishment of religiously and culturally plural societies and this endorsement has affected the treatment of religious minorities in Muslim lands throughout history. He cites the endorsement of pluralism to explain why violent forms of antisemitism generated in medieval and modern Europe, culminating in the Holocaust, never occurred in regions under Muslim rule.On Pluralism, Intolerance, and the Quran. Twf.org. Retrieved on 2012-06-01. Some verses of the Quran, notably , preach tolerance towards members of the Jewish faith.Laqueur, pp. 191‚Äì192 According to Kramer, Jews are regarded as members of a legitimate community of believers in God, \\"people of the Book\\", and therefore legally entitled to sufferance. As one of the five pillars of Islam Muslims perform daily Salat prayers, which involves reciting the first chapter of the Qur'an, the Al-Fatiha. Most commentators suggest that the description, \\"those who earn Thine anger\\" in Surah 1:7 refers to the Jews. Israel Shrenzel, former chief analyst in the Arabic section of the research division of the Shin Bet and a current teacher in Tel Aviv University‚Äôs department of Arabic and Islamic studies wrote, \\"Given that there is contradiction between the content and message of the two groups of verses ‚Äì those hostile to Jews and those tolerant toward them ‚Äì the question is which group is to be adopted nowadays by the Muslim scholars and masses. The more dominant view adheres to the first group\\". In 567, Khaybar was invaded and vacated of its Jewish inhabitants by the Ghassanid Arab Christian king Al- Harith ibn Jabalah. He later freed to the captives upon his return to the Levant. A brief account of the campaign is given by Ibn Qutaybah, and confirmed by the Harran Inscription. See Irfan Shahid's Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century for full details.Irfan Shahid: Byzantium and the Arabs in the sixth century, p. 322 In the 7th century, Khaybar was inhabited by Jews, who pioneered the cultivation of the oasisYƒÅqut, ≈†ihƒÅb al-Dƒ´n ibn ‚ÄòAbd Allah al-·∏§amawƒ´ al-R≈´mƒ´ al-Baƒ°dƒÅdƒ´ (ed. Ferdinand W√ºstenfeld), Mu‚Äôjam al- BuldƒÅn, vol. IV, Leipzig 1866, p. 542 (reprint: ·π¨aharƒÅn 1965, Maktabat al- Asadi); Hayyim Zeev Hirschberg, Israel Ba-‚ÄòArav, Tel Aviv 1946, p. 343 (Hebrew). and made their living growing date palm trees, as well as through commerce and craftsmanship, accumulating considerable wealth. Some objects found by the Muslims when they entered Khaybar -- a siege-engine, 20 bales of Yemenite cloth, and 500 cloaks -- point out to an intense trade carried out by the Jews. In the past some scholars attempted to explain the siege-engine by suggesting that it was used for settling quarrels among the families of the community. Today most academics believe it was stored in a dep√¥t for future sale, in the same way that swords, lances, shields, and other weaponry had been sold by the Jews to Arabs. Equally, the cloth and the cloaks may have been intended for sale, as it was unlikely that such a quantity of luxury goods were kept for the exclusive use of the Jews. The oasis was divided into three regions: al-Natat, al-Shikk, and al-Katiba, probably separated by natural divisions, such as the desert, lava drifts, and swamps. Each of these regions contained several fortresses or redoubts containing homes, storehouses and stables. Each fortress was occupied by a separate family and surrounded by cultivated fields and palm-groves. In order to improve their defensive capabilities, the settlers raised the fortresses up on hills or basalt rocks. Jews continued to live in the oasis for several more years afterwards until they were finally expelled by caliph Umar. The imposition of tribute upon the conquered Jews of the Khaybar Fortress served as a precedent. Islamic law came to require exaction of tribute known as jizya from dhimmis, i.e. non-Muslims under Muslim rule. For many centuries, the oasis at Khaybar was an important caravan stopping place. The center developed around a series of ancient dams built to hold run-off water from the rain. Around the water catchments, date palms grew. Khaybar became an important date-producing center. The words \\"humility\\" and \\"humiliation\\" occur frequently in the Quran and later Muslim literature in relation to Jews. According to Lewis, \\"This, in Islamic view, is their just punishment for their past rebelliousness, and is manifested in their present impotence between the mighty powers of Christendom and Islam.\\" The standard Quranic reference to Jews is verse : \\"And remember ye said: \\"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, garlic, lentils, and onions.\\" He said: \\"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.\\"Lewis (1999), p. 128 Two verses later we read: \\"And remember, Children of Israel, when We made a covenant with you and raised Mount Sinai before you saying, \\"Hold tightly to what We have revealed to you and keep it in mind so that you may guard against evil.\\" But then you turned away, and if it had not been for Allah's grace and mercy, you surely would have been among the lost. And you know those among who sinned on the Sabbath. We said to them, \\"You will be transformed into despised apes.\\" So we used them as a warning to their people and to the following generations, as well as a lesson for the God-fearing.\\" The Quran associates Jews with rejection of God's prophets including Jesus and Muhammad, thus explaining their resistance to him personally. (Cf. Surah 2:87‚Äì91; 5:59, 61, 70, and 82.) It also asserts that Jews and Christians claim to be children of God (Surah 5:18), and that only they will achieve salvation (Surah 2:111). According to the Quran, Jews blasphemously claim that Ezra is the son of God, as Christians claim Jesus is, (Surah 9:30) and that God's hand is fettered (Surah 5:64 ‚Äì i.e., that they can freely defy God). Some of those who are Jews,Here the Quran uses an Arabic expression alladhina hadu (\\"those who are Jewish\\"), which appears in the Quran ten times. Stillman (2006) \\"pervert words from their meanings\\", (Surah 4:44), and because they have committed wrongdoing, God has \\"forbidden some good things that were previously permitted them\\", thus explaining Jewish commandments regarding food, Sabbath restrictions on work, and other rulings as a punishment from God (Surah 4:160). They listen for the sake of mendacity (Surah 5:41), twisting the truth, and practice forbidden usury, and therefore they will receive \\"a painful doom\\" (Surah 4:161). The Quran gives credence to the Christian claim of Jews scheming against Jesus, \\"... but God also schemed, and God is the best of schemers\\"(Surah 3:54). In the Muslim view, the crucifixion of Jesus was an illusion, and thus the supposed Jewish plots against him ended in complete failure. In numerous verses (Surah 3:63, 71; 4:46, 160‚Äì161; 5:41‚Äì44, 63‚Äì64, 82; 6:92) the Quran accuses Jews of deliberately obscuring and perverting scripture. =Influence of Western antisemitism= Martin Kramer argues that \\"Islamic tradition did not hold up those Jews who practiced treachery against Muhammad as archetypes‚Äîas the embodiment of Jews in all times and places.\\" Thus for Muslims to embrace the belief that the Jews are the eternal \\"enemies of God\\", there must be more at work than the Islamic tradition. Islamic tradition does, however, provide the sources for Islamic antisemitism and \\"there is no doubt whatsoever that the Islamic tradition provides sources on which Islamic antisemitism now feeds.\\" The modern use of the Quran to support antisemitism is, however, selective and distorting. The fact that many Islamic thinkers have spent time in the West has resulted in the absorption of antisemitism, he says. Specifically, Kramer believes that the twin concepts of the \\"eternal Jew\\" as the enemy of God and the \\"arch conspirator\\" are themes that are borrowed \\"from the canon of Western religious and racial antisemitism.\\" In his view, Islamic antisemitism is \\"[l]Like other antisemitism\\" in that \\"it has its origins in the anti-rational ideologies of modern Europe, which have now infected the Islamic world.\\" Muhammad and Jews During Muhammad's life, Jews lived on the Arabian Peninsula, especially in and around Medina. Muhammad is known to have had a Jewish wife, Safiyya bint Huyayy, who subsequently converted to Islam.Ibn Saad, al-Tabaqat, pp.120-123. Safiyya, who was previously the wife of Kenana ibn al-Rabi,Ibn Hisham. Al-Sira al-Nabawiyya (The Life of The Prophet). English translation in Guillame (1955), pp. 145‚Äì146 was selected by Muhammad as his bride after the Battle of Khaybar.Sahih Bukhari Vol. 5, Book 59, Hadith 522 According to Islamic sources, the Medinian Jews began to develop friendly alliances with Muhammad's enemies in Mecca so they could overthrow him, despite the fact that they promised not to overthrow him in the treaty of the Constitution of Medina to take the side of him and his followers against their enemies.F.E. Peters (2003), p. 194The Cambridge History of Islam (1977), pp. 43‚Äì44Samuel Rosenblatt, Essays on Antisemitism: The Jews of Islam, p. 112 Two Jewish tribes were expelled and the third one was wiped out.Esposito (1998) pp. 10‚Äì11 The Banu Qaynuqa was expelled for their hostility against the Muslims and for mocking them. The Banu Nadir was expelled after they attempted to assassinate Muhammad. The last one, the Banu Qurayza, was wiped out after the Battle of Trench where they attempted to ally themselves with the invading Quraish. Samuel Rosenblatt opines these incidents were not part of policies directed exclusively against Jews, and Muhammad was more severe with his pagan Arab kinsmen. In addition, Muhammad's conflict with Jews was considered of rather minor importance. According to Lewis, since the clash of Judaism and Islam was resolved and ended during Muhammad's lifetime with Muslim victory, no Muslim unresolved theological dispute fueled antisemitism. There is also a difference between Jewish denial of Christian and Muslim messages, since Muhammad never claimed to be a Messiah or Son of God, although he is referred to as \\"the Apostle of God\\".Lewis (1999) p. 118 The cause of Muhammad's death is disputable, though the Hadiths tend to suggest he may have eventually succumbed to poison after having been poisoned at Khaybar by one of the surviving Jewish widows.Sahih Bukhari Volume 3, Book 47, Number 786Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 59, Number 713 According to Rosenblatt, Muhammad's disputes with his neighboring Jewish tribes left no marked traces on his immediate successors (known as Caliphs). The first Caliphs generally based their treatment upon the Quranic verses encouraging tolerance. Classical commentators viewed Muhammad's struggle with Jews as a minor episode in his career, though the emphasis has shifted in modern times. =Hadith= The hadith (recordings of deeds and sayings attributed to Muhammad) use both the terms Banu Israil and Yahud in relation to Jews, the latter term becoming ever more frequent and appearing mostly in negative context. For example, Jews were \\"cursed and changed into rats\\" in see also According to Norman Stillman: > Jews in Medina are singled out as \\"men whose malice and enmity was aimed at > the Apostle of God\\". The Yah≈´d in this literature appear not only as > malicious, but also deceitful, cowardly and totally lacking resolve. > However, they have none of the demonic qualities attributed to them in > mediaeval Christian literature, neither is there anything comparable to the > overwhelming preoccupation with Jews and Judaism (except perhaps in the > narratives on Muhammad's encounters with Medinan Jewry) in Muslim > traditional literature. Except for a few notable exceptions ... the Jews in > the Sira and the Maghazi are even heroic villains. Their ignominy stands in > marked contrast to Muslim heroism, and in general, conforms to the Quranic > image of \\"wretchedness and baseness stamped upon them\\" Sahih Muslim and Sahih Bukhari record various recensions of a hadith where Muhammad had prophesied that the Day of Judgment will not come until Muslims and Jews fight each other. The Muslims will kill the Jews with such success that they will then hide behind stones or both trees and stones according to various recensions, which will then cry out to a Muslim that a Jew is hiding behind them and ask them to kill him. The only one not to do so will be the Gharqad tree as it is the tree of the Jews. Different interpretations about the Gharqad tree mentioned in the Hadith exists. One of the interpretations is that the Gharqad tree is an actual tree. Israelis have been alleged to plant the tree around various locations for e.g., their settlements in West Bank and Gaza, around Israel Museum and the Knesset. Other claims about the tree are that it grows outside Herod's Gate or that it is actually a bush that grows outside Jaffa Gate which some Muslims believe where Jesus will return to Earth and slay the Dajjal, following the final battle between the Muslims and unbelievers which some believe will take place directly below the Jaffa Gate below the Sultan's Pool. Another interpretation that exists is that the mention of the Gharqad tree is symbolic and is in reference to all the forces of the world believed to conspire with the Jews against Muslims. The following hadith which forms a part of these Sahih Muslim hadiths has been quoted many times, and it became a part of the charter of Hamas.Laqueur, p. 192 According to Schweitzer and Perry, the hadith are \\"even more scathing (than the Quran) in attacking the Jews\\": > They are debased, cursed, anathematized forever by God and so can never > repent and be forgiven; they are cheats and traitors; defiant and stubborn; > they killed the prophets; they are liars who falsify scripture and take > bribes; as infidels they are ritually unclean, a foul odor emanating from > them ‚Äì such is the image of the Jew in classical Islam, degraded and > malevolent. Pre-modern Islam Jerome Chanes, Pinson, Rosenblatt, Mark R. Cohen, Norman Stillman, Uri Avnery, M. Klien, and Bernard Lewis argue that antisemitism in pre-modern Islam is rare, and did not emerge until modern times. Lewis argues that there is little sign any deep-rooted emotional hostility directed against Jews, or any other group, that can be characterized as antisemitism. There were, however, clearly negative attitudes, which were in part the \\"normal\\" feelings of a dominant group towards subject groups. More specifically, the contempt consisted of Muslim contempt for disbelievers.Sources for the following are: *Lewis (1984) p. 32‚Äì33 *Mark Cohen (2002), p. 208 *Stillman (2006) *Avnery, Uri (1968). Israel without Zionists. (New York: Macmillan). p. 220 *M. Klein. New Encyclopedia of Zionism and Israel, Anti-semitism =Literature= According to Lewis, the outstanding characteristic of the classical Islamic view of Jews is their unimportance. The religious, philosophical, and literary Islamic writings tended to ignore Jews and focused more on Christianity. Although the Jews received little praise or even respect and were sometimes blamed for various misdeeds, there were no fears of Jewish conspiracy and domination, nor any charges of diabolic evil, nor accusations of poisoning the wells nor spreading the plague nor were they even accused of engaging in blood libels until Ottomans learned the concept from their Greek subjects in the 15th century.Lewis (1999), pp. 122, 123, 126, 127 Poliakov writes that various examples of medieval Muslim literature portray Judaism as an exemplary pinnacle of faith, and Israel being destined by this virtue. He quotes stories from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights that portray Jews as pious, virtuous and devoted to God, and seem to borrow plots from midrashim. However, Poliakov writes that treatment of Jews in Muslim literature varies, and the tales are meant for pure entertainment, with no didactic aim.Poliakov (1974) pp. 77‚Äì8. After Ibn Nagraela, a Jew, attacked the Quran by alleging various contradictions in it, Ibn Hazm, a Moor, criticized him furiously. Ibn Hazm wrote that Ibn Nagraela was \\"filled with hatred\\" and \\"conceited in his vile soul\\".Poliakov (1974) pp. 92‚Äì3. According to Schweitzer and Perry, some literature during the 10th and 11th century \\"made Jews out to be untrustworthy, treacherous oppressors, and exploiters of Muslims\\". This propaganda sometimes even resulted in outbreaks of violence against the Jews. An 11th-century Moorish poem describes Jews as \\"a criminal people\\" and blames them for causing social decay, betraying Muslims and poisoning food and water. massacre of the Banu Qurayza. Detail from miniature painting The Prophet, Ali, and the Companions at the Massacre of the Prisoners of the Jewish Tribe of Beni Qurayzah, illustration of a 19th-century text by Muhammad Rafi Bazil. Martin Kramer writes that in Islamic tradition, in striking contrast with the Christian concept of the eternal Jew, the contemporary Jews were not presented as archetypes‚Äîas the embodiment of Jews in all times and places. =Life under Muslim rule= Jews, Christians, Sabians, and Zoroastrians living under early and medieval Muslim rule were known as \\"People of the Book\\" to Muslims and subjected to the status of dhimmi, a status that was later also extended to other Non-Muslims like Sikhs, Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists. As dhimmi they were to be tolerated, and entitled to the protection and resources of the Ummah, or Muslim community. In return they had to pay a tax known as the jizya in accordance with Quran.Wehr (1976) pp. 515, 516. Lewis and Poliakov argue that Jewish communities enjoyed toleration and limited rights as long as they accepted Muslim superiority. These rights were legally established and enforced.Lewis (1999) p. 123. The restrictions on dhimmi included: payment of higher taxes; at some locations, being forced to wear clothing or some other insignia distinguishing them from Muslims; sometimes barred from holding public office, bearing arms or riding a horse; disqualified as witnesses in litigation involving Muslims; at some locations and times, dhimmis were prevented from repairing existing or erecting new places of worship. Proselytizing on behalf of any faith but Islam was barred. Dhimmi were subjected to a number of restrictions, the application and severity of which varied with time and place. Restrictions included residency in segregated quarters, obligation to wear distinctive clothing such as the Yellow badge, public subservience to Muslims, prohibitions against proselytizing and against marrying Muslim women, and limited access to the legal system (the testimony of a Jew did not count if contradicted by that of a Muslim). Dhimmi had to pay a special poll tax (the jizya), which exempted them from military service, and also from payment of the zakat alms tax required of Muslims. In return, dhimmi were granted limited rights, including a degree of tolerance, community autonomy in personal matters, and protection from being killed outright. Jewish communities, like Christian ones, were typically constituted as semi- autonomous entities managed by their own laws and leadership, who carried the responsibility for the community towards the Muslim rulers. By medieval standards, conditions for Jews under Islam were generally more formalized and better than those of Jews in Christian lands, in part due to the sharing of minority status with Christians in these lands. There is evidence for this claim in that the status of Jews in lands with no Christian minority was usually worse than their status in lands with one. For example, there were numerous incidents of massacres and ethnic cleansing of Jews in North Africa,The Forgotten Refugees especially in Morocco, Libya, and Algeria where eventually Jews were forced to live in ghettos.Roumani, Maurice. The Case of the Jews from Arab Countries: A Neglected Issue, 1977, pp. 26‚Äì27. Decrees ordering the destruction of synagogues were enacted in the Middle Ages in Egypt, Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. At certain times in Yemen, Morocco, and Baghdad, Jews were forced to convert to Islam or face the death penalty.Bat Ye'or, The Dhimmi, 1985, p. 61 Later additions to the code included prohibitions on adopting Arab names, studying the Quran, selling alcoholic beverages. Abdul Aziz Said writes that the Islamic concept of dhimmi, when applied, allowed other cultures to flourish and prevented the general rise of antisemitism.Abdul Aziz Said (1979), The situation where Jews both enjoyed cultural and economic prosperity at times, but were widely persecuted at other times, was summarised by G. E. Von Grunebaum: > It would not be difficult to put together the names of a very sizable number > of Jewish subjects or citizens of the Islamic area who have attained to high > rank, to power, to great financial influence, to significant and recognized > intellectual attainment; and the same could be done for Christians. But it > would again not be difficult to compile a lengthy list of persecutions, > arbitrary confiscations, attempted forced conversions, or pogroms.G. E. Von > Grunebaum, Eastern Jewry Under Islam, 1971, p. 369. Schweitzer and Perry give as examples of early Muslim antisemitism: 9th- century \\"persecution and outbreaks of violence\\"; 10th- and 11th-century antisemitic propaganda that \\"made Jews out to be untrustworthy, treacherous oppressors, and exploiters of Muslims\\". This propaganda \\"inspired outbreaks of violence and caused many casualties in Egypt\\". An 11th-century Moorish poem describes Jews as \\"a criminal people\\" and alleges that \\"society is nearing collapse on account of Jewish wealth and domination, their exploitation and betrayal of Muslims; that Jews worship the devil, physicians poison their patients, and Jews poison food and water as required by Judaism, and so on.\\" Jews under the Muslim rule rarely faced martyrdom, exile, or forced conversion to Islam, and they were fairly free to choose their residence and profession. Their freedom and economic condition varied from time to time and place to place.Lewis (1999) p. 131Stillman (1979) p. 27 Forced conversions occurred mostly in the Maghreb, especially under the Almohads, a militant dynasty with messianic claims, as well as in Persia, where Shia Muslims were generally less tolerant than their Sunni counterparts.Lewis (1984), pp. 94‚Äì95 Notable examples of the cases where the choice of residence was taken away from them includes confining Jews to walled quarters (mellah) in Morocco beginning from the 15th century and especially since the early 19th century.Lewis (1984), p. 28 =Egypt and Iraq= The caliphs of Fatimid dynasty in Egypt were known to be Judeophiles, according to Leon Poliakov. They paid regularly to support the Jewish institutions (such as the rabbinical academy of Jerusalem). A significant number of their ministers and counselors were Jews. The Abbasids too similarly were respectful and tolerant towards the Jews under their rule. Benjamin of Tudela, a famous 12th-century Jewish explorer, described the Caliph al-Abbasi as a \\"great king and kind unto Israel\\". Benjamin also further goes on to describe about al-Abassi that \\"many belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants, he knows all languages and is well-versed in the Law of Israel. He reads and writes the holy language [Hebrew].\\" He further mentions Muslims and Jews being involved in common devotions, such as visiting the grave of Ezekiel, whom both religions regard as a prophet.Poliakov (1974) pp. 60‚Äì2 =Iberian Peninsula= With the Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Spanish Judaism flourished for several centuries. Thus, what some refer to as the \\"golden age\\" for Jews began. During this period the Muslims of Spain tolerated other religions, including Judaism, and created a heterodox society.Poliakov (1974) pp. 91‚Äì6 Muslim relations with Jews in Spain were not always peaceful, however. The eleventh century saw Muslim pogroms against Jews in Spain; those occurred in C√≥rdoba in 1011 and in Granada in 1066.Schweitzer, pp. 267‚Äì268. In the 1066 Granada massacre, a Muslim mob crucified the Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred about 4,000 Jews.Granada by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed. The Muslim grievance involved was that some Jews had become wealthy, and others had advanced to positions of power. The Almohad dynasty, which overthrew the dynasty that ran Spain during the early Muslim era, offered Christians and Jews the choice of conversion or expulsion; in 1165, one of their rulers ordered that all Jews in the country convert on pain of death (forcing the Jewish rabbi, theologian, philosopher, and physician Maimonides to feign conversion to Islam before fleeing the country). In Egypt, Maimonides resumed practicing Judaism openly only to be accused of apostasy. He was saved from death by Saladin's chief administrator, who held that conversion under coercion is invalid.Kraemer, Joel L., Moses Maimonides: An Intellectual Portrait in The Cambridge Companion to Maimonides pp. 16‚Äì17 (2005) During his wanderings, Maimonides also wrote The Yemen Epistle, a famous letter to the Jews of Yemen, who were then experiencing severe persecution at the hands of their Muslim rulers. In it, Maimonides describes his assessment of the treatment of the Jews at the hands of Muslims: > ... on account of our sins God has cast us into the midst of this people, > the nation of Ishmael [that is, Muslims], who persecute us severely, and who > devise ways to harm us and to debase us.... No nation has ever done more > harm to Israel. None has matched it in debasing and humiliating us. None has > been able to reduce us as they have.... We have borne their imposed > degradation, their lies, their absurdities, which are beyond human power to > bear.... We have done as our sages of blessed memory have instructed us, > bearing the lies and absurdities of Ishmael.... In spite of all this, we are > not spared from the ferocity of their wickedness and their outbursts at any > time. On the contrary, the more we suffer and choose to conciliate them, the > more they choose to act belligerently toward us.Maimonides, \\"Epistle to the > Jews of Yemen\\", translated in Stillman (1979), pp. 241‚Äì242 Mark Cohen quotes Haim Hillel Ben-Sasson, a specialist in medieval European Jewish history, who cautioned that Maimonides' condemnation of Islam should be understood \\"in the context of the harsh persecutions of the 12th century and that furthermore one may say that he was insufficiently aware of the status of the Jews in Christian lands, or did not pay attention to this, when he wrote the letter\\". Cohen continues by quoting Ben-Sasson, who argues that Jews generally had a better legal and security situation in Muslim countries than Jews had in Christendom.Cohen (1995) pp. xvii‚Äìxviii =Ottoman Empire= While some Muslim states declined, the Ottoman Empire rose as the \\"greatest Muslim state in history\\". As long as the empire flourished, the Jews did as well, according to Schweitzer and Perry. In contrast with their treatment of Christians, the Ottomans were more tolerant of Jews and promoted their economic development. The Jews flourished as great merchants, financiers, government officials, traders and artisans.Schweitzer, pp. 266‚Äì267 The Ottomans also allowed some Jewish immigration to what was then referred to as Syria, which allowed for Zionists to establish permanent settlements in the 1880s. =Contrast with Christian Europe= Lewis states that in contrast with Christian antisemitism, the attitude of Muslims towards non-Muslims is not one of hate, fear, or envy, but rather contempt. This contempt is expressed in various ways, such as an abundance of polemic literature which attacks the Christians and occasionally, it also attacks the Jews. \\"The negative attributes ascribed to the subject religions and their followers are usually expressed in religious and social terms, very rarely are they expressed in ethnic or racial terms, though this sometimes does occur.\\" The language of abuse is often quite strong. The conventional epithets are apes for Jews, and pigs for Christians. Lewis continues with several examples of regulations which symbolize the inferiority that non-Muslims who lived under Muslim rule had to live with, such as different formulae of greetings when addressing Jews and Christians than when addressing Muslims (both in conversations or correspondences), and forbidding Jews and Christians from choosing names that Muslims chose for their children during Ottoman rule.Lewis (1984) p. 33 Schweitzer and Perry argue that there are two general views of the status of Jews under Islam, the traditional \\"golden age\\" and the revisionist \\"persecution and pogrom\\" interpretations. The former was first promulgated by Jewish historians in the 19th century as a rebuke of the Christian treatment of Jews, and it was taken up by Arab Muslims after 1948 as \\"an Arab-Islamist weapon in what is primarily an ideological and political struggle against Israel\\". The revisionists argue that this idealized view ignores \\"a catalog of lesser-known hatred and massacres\\". Mark Cohen concurs with this view, arguing that the \\"myth of an interfaith utopia\\" went unchallenged until it was adopted by Arabs as a \\"propaganda weapon against Zionism\\",Cohen (1995) p. 6. and that this \\"Arab polemical exploitation\\" was met with the \\"counter-myth\\" of the \\"neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history\\",Cohen (1995) p. 9. which also \\"cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality\\".Cohen (1995) p.xvii: According to Cohen, both the views equally distort the past. Antisemitism in the Islamic Middle East Antisemitism has increased in the Muslim world during modern times.Muslim Anti-Semitism by Bernard Lewis (Middle East Quarterly) June 1998 While Bernard Lewis and Uri Avnery date the increase in antisemitism to the establishment of Israel, M. Klein suggests that antisemitism could have been present in the mid-19th century.Avnery, Uri (1968). Israel without Zionists. (New York: Macmillan). pg. 220 Scholars point to European influences, including those of the Nazis (see below), and the establishment of Israel as the root causes of antisemitism. Norman Stillman explains that increased European commercial, missionary and imperialist activities during the 19th and 20th centuries brought antisemitic ideas to the Muslim world. Initially these prejudices only found a reception among Arab Christians because they were too foreign to gain any widespread acceptance among Muslims. However, with the rise of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, European antisemitism began to gain acceptance in modern literature. =17th century= One of the most prominent acts of Islamic antisemitism took place in Yemen between 1679‚Äì1680, in an event known as the Mawza Exile. During this event the Jews living in nearly all cities and towns throughout Yemen were banished by decree of the Imam of Yemen, Al-Mahdi Ahmad.See Mawza Exile wiki page =19th century= According to Mark Cohen, Arab antisemitism in the modern world arose relatively recently, in the 19th century, against the backdrop of conflicting Jewish and Arab nationalisms, and it was primarily imported into the Arab world by nationalistically minded Christian Arabs (and only subsequently was it \\"Islamised\\").Mark Cohen (2002), p. 208 \\"Execution of a Moroccan Jewess (Sol Hachuel)\\", painting by Alfred Dehodencq The Damascus affair occurred in 1840, when an Italian monk and his servant disappeared in Damascus. Immediately following it, a charge of ritual murder was brought against a large number of Jews in the city. All of them were found guilty. The consuls of England, France and Austria as well as Ottoman authorities, Christians, Muslims and Jews all played a great role in this affair.Frankel, Jonathan: The Damascus Affair: 'Ritual Murder', Politics, and the Jews in 1840 (Cambridge University Press, 1997) p. 1 A massacre of Jews also occurred in Baghdad in 1828.Morris, Benny. Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist- Arab Conflict, 1881‚Äì2001. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10‚Äì11. There was another massacre in Barfurush in 1867. In 1839, in the eastern Persian city of Meshed, a mob burst into the Jewish Quarter, burned the synagogue, and destroyed the Torah scrolls. This is known as the Allahdad incident. It was only by forcible conversion that a massacre was averted. Benny Morris writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: \\"I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish gaberdine. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan.\\" =20th century= The massacres of Jews in Muslim countries continued into the 20th century. The Jewish quarter in Fez was almost destroyed by a Muslim mob in 1912. There were Nazi-inspired pogroms in Algeria in the 1930s, and massive attacks on the Jews in Iraq and Libya in the 1940s (see Farhud). Pro-Nazi Muslims slaughtered dozens of Jews in Baghdad in 1941. American academic Bernard Lewis and others have charged that standard antisemitic themes have become commonplace in the publications of Arab Islamist movements such as Hezbollah and Hamas, in the pronouncements of various agencies of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and even in the newspapers and other publications of Refah Partisi, the Turkish Islamic party whose head served as prime minister in 1996‚Äì97.\\" Lewis has also written that the language of abuse is often quite strong, arguing that the conventional epithets for Jews and Christians are apes and pigs, respectively.Lewis (1984) pp. 33‚Äì34 On March 1, 1994, Rashid Baz, an American Muslim living in Brooklyn, New York, shot at a van carrying Hassidic Jewish students over the Brooklyn Bridge. The students were returning to Brooklyn after visiting their ailing leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who suffered a stroke two years earlier. Ari Halberstam, one of the students, was killed. Others were wounded. Baz was quoted in his confession in 2007 as saying, \\"I only shot them because they were Jewish.\\" Connections between Nazi Germany and Muslim countries Burning synagogue in Aleppo in 1947 Some Arabs found common cause with Nazi Germany against colonial regimes in the Middle East. The influence of the Nazis grew in the Arab world during the 1930s.Lewis (1999) p. 147 Egypt, Syria, and Iran are claimed to have harbored Nazi war criminals, though they have rejected this charge. With the recruiting help of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar, mostly formed by Muslims in 1943, was the first non-Germanic SS division. =Amin al-Husseini= Amin al-Husseini, Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and the chairman of the Supreme Islamic Council meeting with Adolf Hitler (December 1941) Bosnian Muslim Waffen-SS volunteers with a Nazi salute. At right is SS General Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig. Bosnian Muslim soldiers of the SS \\"Handschar\\" reading a Nazi propaganda book, Islam und Judentum, in Nazi-occupied Southern France (Bundesarchiv, June 1943) The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Amin al-Husseini attempted to create an alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy in order to obstruct the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, and hinder any emigration by Jewish refugees from the Holocaust there. Historians debate to what extent al-Husseini's fierce opposition to Zionism was based on Arab nationalism or antisemitism, or a combination of the two.Eric Rouleau, Qui √©tait le mufti de J√©rusalem ? (Who was the Mufti of Jerusalem ?), Le Monde diplomatique, August 1994. On March 31, 1933, within weeks of Hitler's rise to power in Germany, al-Husseini sent a telegram to Berlin addressed to the German Consul-General in the British Mandate of Palestine saying that Muslims in Palestine and elsewhere looked forward to spreading their ideology in the Middle East. Al-Husseini secretly met the German Consul-General near the Dead Sea in 1933 and expressed his approval of the anti-Jewish boycott in Germany and asked him not to send any Jews to Palestine. Later that year, the Mufti's assistants approached Wolff, seeking his help in establishing an Arab National Socialist party in Palestine. Reports reaching the foreign offices in Berlin showed high levels of Arab admiration of Hitler.Nicosia (2000), pp. 85‚Äì86. Al-Husseini met the German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop on November 20, 1941, and was officially received by Hitler on November 30, 1941, in Berlin.Segev (2001), p. 463. He asked Hitler for a public declaration that \\"recognized and sympathized with the Arab struggles for independence and liberation, and that it would support the elimination of a national Jewish homeland\\", and he submitted to the German government a draft of such a declaration, containing the clause.Lewis (1984), p. 190. Al-Husseini aided the Axis cause in the Middle East by issuing a fatwa for a holy war against Britain in May 1941. The Mufti's widely heralded proclamation against Britain was declared in Iraq, where he was instrumental in the anti-British Iraqi revolt of 1941.Hirszowicz, pp. 82‚Äì83 During the war, the Mufti repeatedly made requests to \\"the German government to bomb Tel Aviv\\".Lewis (1995), p. 351. Al-Husseini was involved in the organization and recruitment of Bosnian Muslims into several divisions of the Waffen SS and other units. and also blessed sabotage teams trained by Germans before they were dispatched to Palestine, Iraq, and Transjordan. =Iraq= In March 1940, General Rashid Ali, a nationalist Iraqi officer forced the pro-British Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri Said Pasha, to resign. In May, he declared jihad against Great Britain. Forty days later, British troops occupied the country. The 1941 Iraqi coup d'√©tat occurred on April 3, 1941, when the regime of the Regent 'Abd al-Ilah was overthrown, and Rashid Ali was installed as Prime Minister. In 1941, following Rashid Ali's pro-Axis coup, riots known as the Farhud broke out in Baghdad in which approximately 180 Jews were killed and about 240 were wounded, 586 Jewish-owned businesses were looted and 99 Jewish houses were destroyed.Levin, Itamar (2001). Locked Doors: The Seizure of Jewish Property in Arab Countries. (Praeger/Greenwood) , p. 6. Mass grave of victims of the Farhud, 1941. Iraq initially forbade the emigration of its Jews after the 1948 war on the grounds that allowing them to go to Israel would strengthen that state, but they were allowed to emigrate again after 1950, if they agreed to forgo their assets. =The Ottoman Empire, Turkey, Iraq and Kurdistan=Jews and Assyrian Christians forced migrations between 1842 and the 21st century In his recent PhD thesisMordechai Zaken, \\"Tribal chieftains and their Jewish Subjects: A comparative Study in Survival: PhD Thesis, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2004. and in his recent bookMordechai Zaken, \\"Jewish Subjects and their tribal chieftains in Kurdistan: A Study in Survival\\", Brill: Leiden and Boston, 2007 ISBN . the Israeli scholar Mordechai Zaken discussed the history of the Assyrian Christians of Turkey and Iraq (in the Kurdish vicinity) during the last 90 years, from 1843 onwards. In his studies Zaken outlines three major eruptions that took place between 1843 and 1933 during which the Assyrian Christians lost their land and hegemony in their habitat in the HakkƒÅrƒ´ (or Julamerk) region in southeastern Turkey and became refugees in other lands, notably Iran and Iraq, and ultimately established exiled communities in European and western countries (the US, Canada, Australia, New-Zealand, Sweden, France, to mention some of these countries). Mordechai Zaken wrote this study from an analytical and comparative point of view, comparing the Assyrian Christians' experience with the experience of the Kurdish Jews who had been dwelling in Kurdistan for two thousand years or so, but were forced to emigrate to Israel in the early 1950s. The Jews of Kurdistan were forced to leave as a result of the Arab-Israeli war, as a result of increasing hostility and acts of violence against Jews in Iraqi and Kurdish towns and villages, and as a result of a new situation that developed during the 1940s in Iraq and Kurdistan in which the ability of Jews to live in relative comfort and tolerance (that was disrupted from time to time prior to that period) with their Arab and Muslim neighbors, as they had done for many years, practically came to an end. In the end, the Jews of Kurdistan had to leave their Kurdish habitat en masse and migrate into Israel. The Assyrian Christians, on the other hand, suffered a similar fate but migrated in stages following each political crisis with the regime in whose boundaries they lived or following each conflict with their Muslim, Turkish, or Arab neighbors, or following the departure or expulsion of their patriarch Mar Shimon in 1933, first to Cyprus and then to the United States. Consequently, although there is still a small and fragile community of Assyrians in Iraq, millions of Assyrian Christians live today in exiled and prosperous communities in the west.Joyce Blau, one of the world's leading scholars in Kurdish culture, language and history, suggested, \\"This part of Mr. Zaken's thesis, concerning Jewish life in Iraqi Kurdistan, well complements the impressive work of the pioneer ethnologist Erich Brauer. Brauer was indeed one of the most skilled ethnographs of the first half of the 20th century and wrote an important book on the Jews of Kurdistan.\\" (Erich Brauer, The Jews of Kurdistan, first edition 1940, revised edition 1993, completed and edited by Raphael Patai, Wayne State University Press, Detroit) =Iran= Although Iran was officially neutral during the Second World War, Reza Shah sympathized with Nazi Germany, making the Jewish community fearful of possible persecutions.Sanasarian (2000), p. 46. Although these fears did not materialise, anti-Jewish articles were published in the Iranian media. Following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941, Reza Shah was deposed and replaced by his son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. However, Kaveh Farrokh argues that there is a misconception that antisemitism was widespread in Iran with Reza Shah in power. =Egypt= In Egypt, Ahmad Husayn founded the Young Egypt Party in 1934. He immediately expressed his sympathy for Nazi Germany to the German ambassador to Egypt. Husayn sent a delegation to the Nuremberg rally and returned with enthusiasm. After the Sudeten Crisis, the party leaders denounced Germany for aggression against small nations, but nonetheless retained elements similar to those of Nazism or Fascism, e.g. salutes, torchlight parades, leader worship, and antisemitism and racism. The party's impact before 1939 was minimal, and their espionage efforts were of little value to the Germans.Lewis (1999) pp. 148‚Äì149. During World War II, Cairo was a haven for agents and spies throughout the war. Egyptian nationalists were active, with many Egyptians, including Farouk of Egypt and prime minister Ali Mahir Pasha, all of whom hoped for an Axis victory, and full independence of Egypt from Britain. Islamist groups Many Islamist militant groups have openly expressed antisemitic views. Lashkar-e-Toiba's propaganda arm has declared the Jews to be \\"Enemies of Islam\\", and Israel to be the \\"Enemy of Pakistan\\".B. Raman . The Hindu (2001-01-05) Hamas has been widely described as antisemitic. It has issued antisemitic leaflets, and its writings and manifestos rely upon antisemitic documents (the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and other European Christian literature), exhibiting antisemitic themes.Antisemitic: *Aaronovitch, David. \\"The New Anti-Semitism\\", The Observer, June 22, 2003. *\\"Hamas refuses to recognize Israel, claims the whole of Palestine as an Islamic endowment, has issued virulently antisemitic leaflets, ...\\" Laurence F.

The Protocols of the Elders of Zion also informs Hamas's belief that Israel has hegemonic aspirations that extend beyond Palestinian land.

Arrigo, The Terrorist Identity: Explaining the Terrorist Threat, NYU Press, 2006, , pp. 133‚Äì134. *\\"Standard anti-Semitic themes have become commonplace in the propaganda of Arab Islamic movements like Hizballah and Hamas....\\" Lewis (1999) In 1998, Esther Webman of the Project for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Tel Aviv University wrote that although the above is true, antisemitism was not the main tenet of Hamas ideology. In an editorial in The Guardian in January 2006, Khaled Meshaal, the chief of Hamas's political bureau denied antisemitism, on Hamas' part, and he said that the nature of Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict was not religious but political. He also said that Hamas has \\"no problem with Jews who have not attacked us\\". The tone and casting of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as part of an eternal struggle between Muslim and Jews by the Hamas Covenant had become an obstacle for the movement to be able to take part in diplomatic forums involving Western nations. The movement came under pressure to update its founding charter issued in 1988 which called for Israel's destruction and advocated violent means for achieving a Palestinian state. A new charter issued in May 2014 stated that the group doesn't seek war with the Jewish people but only against Zionism which it holds responsible for \\"occupation of Palestine\\", while terming Israel as the \\"Zionist enemy\\". It also accepted a Palestnian state within the Green Line as transitional but also advocated \\"liberation of all of Palestine\\". Amal Saad-Ghorayeb, a Shiite scholar and assistant professor at the Lebanese American University has written that Hezbollah is not anti- Zionist, but rather anti-Jewish. She quoted Hassan Nasrallah as saying: \\"If we searched the entire world for a person more cowardly, despicable, weak and feeble in psyche, mind, ideology and religion, we would not find anyone like the Jew. Notice, I do not say the Israeli.\\" Regarding the official public stance of Hezbollah as a whole, she said that while Hezbollah, \\"tries to mask its anti-Judaism for public-relations reasons ... a study of its language, spoken and written, reveals an underlying truth.\\" In her book Hezbollah: Politics & Religion, she argues that Hezbollah \\"believes that Jews, by the nature of Judaism, possess fatal character flaws\\". Saad-Ghorayeb also said, \\"Hezbollah's Quranic reading of Jewish history has led its leaders to believe that Jewish theology is evil.\\" =21st century= France is home to Europe's largest population of Muslims‚Äîabout 6 million‚Äîas well as the continent's largest community of Jews, about 600,000. Particularly during the beginning of the second intifada, Muslims attacked synagogues throughout France in solidarity with those in Palestine. Many Jews protested, and the acts were declared \\"Muslim antisemitism\\". By 2007, however, attacks were much less severe, and an \\"all-clear\\" was perceived.Jews for Le Pen by Daniel Ben-Simon. Haaretz. 25/03/07 However, during the 2008‚Äì2009 Gaza War, tensions between the two communities increased and there were several dozen reported instances of Muslim violence such as arson and assaults. French Jewish leaders complained of \\"a diffuse kind of anti-Semitism becoming entrenched in the Muslim community\\" while Muslim leaders responded that the issues were \\"political rather than religious\\" and that Muslim anger is \\"not against Jews, it's against Israel\\".Gaza conflict reverberates in France by Katrin Bennhold, The New York Times, January 20, 2009.

Reconciliation efforts In Western countries, some Islamic groups and individual Muslims have made efforts to reconcile with the Jewish community through dialogue and to oppose antisemitism. For instance, in Britain there is the group Muslims Against Anti-Semitism.Muslims Against Anti-Semitism, Anti- Semitism in Europe, Islamophobia in Europe. Ma-as.org.uk. Retrieved on 2012-06-01.See also, the position of the Free Muslims Coalition. Islamic studies scholar Tariq Ramadan has been outspoken against antisemitism, stating: \\"In the name of their faith and conscience, Muslims must take a clear position so that a pernicious atmosphere does not take hold in the Western countries. Nothing in Islam can legitimize xenophobia or the rejection of a human being due to his/her religious creed or ethnicity. One must say unequivocally, with force, that anti-Semitism is unacceptable and indefensible.\\"For instance, see Ramadan's article in the UN Chronicle and coverage of his efforts by Ha-artez , an Israeli newspaper. Mohammad Khatami, former president of Iran, declared antisemitism to be a \\"Western phenomena\\", having no precedents in Islam and stating the Muslims and Jews had lived harmoniously in the past. An Iranian newspaper stated that there has been hatred and hostility in history, but conceded that one must distinguish Jews from Zionists. In North America, the Council on American-Islamic Relations has spoken against some antisemitic violence, such as the 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting. According to the Anti-Defamation League, CAIR has also been affiliated with antisemitic organizations such as Hamas and Hizbollah. The Saudi mufti, Shaykh Abd al-Aziz Bin Baz, gave a fatwa ruling that negotiating peace with Israel is permissible, as is the cist to Jerusalem by Muslims. He specifically said: Martin Kramer considers that as \\"an explicit endorsement of normal relations with Jews\\". Trends According to Norman Stillman, Antisemitism in the Muslim world increased greatly for more than two decades following 1948 but \\"peaked by the 1970s, and declined somewhat as the slow process of rapprochement between the Arab world and the state of Israel evolved in the 1980s and 1990s\\". Johannes J. G. Jansen believes that antisemitism will have no future in the Arab world in the long run. In his view, like other imports from the Western World, antisemitism is unable to establish itself in the private lives of Muslims. In 2004 Khaleel Mohammed said, \\"Anti-Semitism has become an entrenched tenet of Muslim theology, taught to 95 per cent of the religion's adherents in the Islamic world,\\" a claim immediately dismissed as false and racist by Muslim leaders, who accused Mohammed of destroying efforts at relationship building between Jews and Muslims.Bruemmer, Rene. \\"Muslim speaker denounced: He doesn't speak for Islam: leaders.

In 2010, Moshe Ma'oz, Professor Emeritus of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at The Hebrew University, edited a book questioning the common perception Islam is antisemitic or anti- Israel, and maintaining that most Arab regimes and most leading Muslim clerics have a pragmatic attitude to Israel.Moshe Ma'oz, Muslim Attitudes to Jews and Israel: The Ambivalences of Rejection, Antagonism, Tolerance and Cooperation, Sussex University Press, 2010. According to Akiva Eldar 'The more Germans know about the Mideast, the more they root for the Palestinians' at Haaretz, June 26, 2012, Ma'oz holds that 'most researchers of Islam agree that along with periods of oppression and persecution, the Jewish communities in the Islamic countries enjoyed long eras of coexistence and tolerance. Ma'oz stresses that most of the regimes in the Arab and Muslim world, and most leading Muslim clerics, have adapted pragmatic attitudes toward Israel and the Jews. He pointed out the close connection between the occupation in the territories, the dispute regarding the Jerusalem sites that are sacred to Islam and the strengthening of the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel tendencies in the Muslim world.' According to professor Robert Wistrich, director of the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism (SICSA), the calls for the destruction of Israel by Iran or by Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, or the Muslim Brotherhood, represent a contemporary mode of genocidal antisemitism. According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project released on August 14, 2005, high percentages of the populations of six Muslim-majority countries have negative views of Jews.

Since the Gaza War in 2009, decreases in antisemitism have been reversed. A report compiled by the Coordination Forum for Countering Anti- Semitism singled out France in particular among Western countries for antisemitism. Between the start of the Israeli offensive in Gaza in late December and the end of it in January, an estimated hundred antisemitic acts were recorded in France. This compares with a total of 250 antisemitic acts in the whole of 2007. In 2012, Mohammed Merah killed four Jews, including three children, at the Ozar HaTorah Jewish school in Toulouse. Shortly after the Charlie Hebdo shooting in 2015, Amedy Coulibaly murdered four Jewish patrons of a Kosher supermarket in Paris and held fifteen people hostage in the Porte de Vincennes siege.

It was commissioned by David Attenborough and aired on BBC2 from 1971 to 1988. It took over the BBC2 late-night slot from Disco 2, which ran between September 1970 and July 1971, while continuing to feature non-chart music. The show was devised by BBC producer Rowan Ayers. The original producer, involved in an executive capacity throughoutCredits of the programme the show's entire history, was Michael Appleton. According to presenter Bob Harris, the programme derived its name from a Tin Pan Alley phrase from years before. When they got the first pressing of a record they would play it to people they called the old greys ‚Äì doormen in grey suits. Any song they could remember and whistle, having heard it just once or twice, had passed the old grey whistle test.Spencer Leigh, Frank Sinatra: An Extraordinary Life, chapter 5 (Carmarthen: McNidder & Grace, 2015. ). On 23 February 2018, a one-off three-hour special of The Old Grey Whistle Test was broadcast on BBC Four, hosted by Bob Harris to mark 30 years since the final episode aired. History Launched on BBC2, the show focused on albums, rather than chart hits covered on BBC1 by Top of the Pops. It was originally produced in a studio at BBC Television Centre in west London known as \\"Pres B\\", which had been originally designed for shooting weather forecasts and in- vision continuity. The studio was only . Due to the lack of technology that accommodated live performances, bands mimed to tracks in early episodes. The original opening credits were played over a naked woman, painted in green, dancing to Santana's \\"Jingo\\". When Richard Williams was replaced by 'Whispering' Bob Harris, the series' opening titles theme was changed to the now more famous animation of a male figure made up of stars (known as the 'Star Kicker') dancing. The programme's title music, with its harmonica theme, was a track called \\"Stone Fox Chase\\" by a Nashville band, Area Code 615. The first host was Richard Williams, features editor of Melody Maker, the music weekly. From 1972, the programme was presented by disc jockey Bob Harris (nicknamed \\"Whispering Bob Harris\\" because of his quiet voice and laid-back style). He later became notorious among the younger generation for distancing himself on air from Roxy Music's first performance on the show and calling the New York Dolls \\"mock rock\\" and left OGWT in 1978. After Harris's departure, Annie Nightingale took over as host. In December 1980, Nightingale presented the show in the immediate aftermath of the shooting of John Lennon (who had appeared on the show in 1975). This particular episode consisted almost entirely of interviews with various people about Lennon's life and career. Annie Nightingale presenting Whistle Test c. 1980 Following the departure of Nightingale in 1982, Mark Ellen, David Hepworth and Richard Skinner also took turns as presenters. In 1983, the programme was moved to a live mid-evening slot. The title was abridged to Whistle Test and the title credits and music were changed. Andy Kershaw joined the series as a presenter in 1984. The same four presenters co-presented the BBC's television coverage of Live Aid in 1985. The series was cancelled in early 1987 by Janet Street-Porter, who had been appointed head of Youth Programmes at the BBC. The series ended with a live New Year's Eve special broadcast through to the early hours of New Year's Day 1988: material included \\"Hotel California\\" by The Eagles, live from 1977, and \\"Bat Out of Hell\\" by Meat Loaf. Owing to technical issues during the show's early years, and the need to ensure performances were controlled, the bands often recorded the instrumental tracks the day before. The vocals were then performed live, \\"99 percent\\" of the time. After 1973, the show changed to an entirely live format. On 23 February 2018, the BBC broadcast a special programme, hosted by Bob Harris, to mark the 30 years since the legendary series was last broadcast. This live studio show featured music, special guests and rare archive footage. It featured performances from Peter Frampton, Richard Thompson, Albert Lee and others. Bob Harris chatted to Whistle Test alumni, including Dave Stewart, Joan Armatrading, Ian Anderson, Chris Difford and Kiki Dee, as well as fan Danny Baker.

The literary role of artificial life has evolved over time: early myths present animated objects as instruments of divine will, later stories treat their attempted creation as a blasphemy with inevitable consequences, and modern tales range from apocalyptic warnings against blind technological progress to explorations of the ethical questions raised by the possibility of sentient machines. Recently, a popular overview of the history of androids, robots, cyborgs and replicants from antiquity to the present has been published. Treated fields of knowledge are: history of technology, history of medicine, philosophy, literature, film and art history, the range of topics discussed is worldwide. Early uses The earliest examples were all presented as the results of divine intervention and include: The dry bones that came to life in the Book of Ezekiel (Chapter 37); three-legged self- navigating tables created by the god Hephaestus (Iliad xviii); and the statue Galatea, brought to life by the prayers of her creator Pygmalion. More recent humaniform examples include the brooms from the legend of the sorcerer's apprentice derived from a tale by Lucian of Samosata in the 1st century AD, the Jewish legend of the golem created like Adam from clay, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. These tales include an indictment of human folly at presuming to take on the role of creator. Notable mechanical representations of humans include the life-sized singing puppet Olimpia in the short story \\"The Sandman\\" by E. T. A. Hoffmann in 1816 and a bipedal anthropomorphic mechanism in The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis in 1868.37 original stories about anthropomorphic and zoomorphic machines appeared in dime novels between 1868 and 1899. See Dime Novel Robots by Joseph A. Lovece. https://www.amazon.com/Dime-Novel-Robots-1868-1899-Bibliography/dp/1511578661/ These examples are stories about human-controlled mechanisms without autonomy or self-awareness. In Lyman Frank Baum's children's novel Ozma of Oz, the first-ever introduction of a humanoid-appearance mechanical man that would satisfy the later \\"humanoid robot\\" definition occurred in 1907 - some fifteen years before the word \\"robot\\" was coined - with Tik-Tok, powered with a trio of clockwork movements for his thinking, movement and speech, none of which he could wind up himself. In 1912,Litteraturbanken Selma Lagerl√∂f published the poem Sl√•tterkarlarna p√• EkolsundSl√•tterkarlarna p√• Ekolsund which was published in the first part of Troll och m√§nniskor. In the poem Christopher Polhem is hired to create mechanical mowers for a farmer. The modern \\"Robot\\" The first use of the word Robot was in Karel ƒåapek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots) written in 1920 and first performed in Czechoslovakia in 1921, in New York City in 1922 and an English edition published in 1923. Artificial living beings are created from a chemical substitute for protoplasm but over time they learn about violence from their human creators and begin to revolt. The play ends on an optimistic, even spiritual, note as the artificial biology leads a male and female robot to fall in love and inherit the earth. While Karel ƒåapek's play introduced the word \\"robot\\" into languages around the globe but he later wrote a letter to the Oxford English Dictionary of etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef ƒåapek, as its true inventor. In an article in the Czech Lidov√© noviny in 1933 he also explains that he originally wanted to call the creatures \\"labo≈ôi\\" from the Latin word labor. Karel found the word too bookish and sought advice from Josef who suggested to call them \\"robots\\". The word, which is always capitalized in ƒåapek's play, derives from robota which means \\"drudgery\\" in Czech and means \\"work\\" in Slovak.) The theme of robots has been picked up by science fiction writers and many volumes are focused on robots and their interaction with the human species. Of particular note is the work of Isaac Asimov as a large part of his work centers on robots. Asimov is particularly known for his creation of the Three laws of robotics which he uses in his stories as both to define his robots and how these interact within the worlds he creates.

Originally, \\"rumba\\" was used as a synonym for \\"party\\" in northern Cuba, and by the late 19th century it was used to denote the complex of secular music styles known as Cuban rumba.Al√©n Rodr√≠guez, Olavo (2010). \\"A History of the Congas\\". AfroCubaWeb. Retrieved November 6, 2015.Pe√±alosa, David (2011). Rumba Quinto. Bembe Books. p. 183. Since the early 20th century the term has been used in different countries to refer to distinct styles of music and dance, most of which are only tangentially related to the original Cuban rumba, if at all. The vague etymological origin of the term rumba, as well as its interchangeable use with guaracha in settings such as bufo theatre, is largely responsible for such worldwide polysemy of the term. In addition, \\"rumba\\" was the primary marketing term for Cuban music in North America, as well as West and Central Africa, during much of the 20th century, before the rise of mambo, pachanga and salsa. \\"Rumba\\" entered the English lexicon in the early 20th century, at least as early as 1919, and by 1932 it was used a verb to denote the ballroom dance. In this sense, the anglicised spelling \\"rhumba\\" became prevalent and is now recommended to distinguish it from traditional Cuban rumba. Also in the first third of the 20th century, \\"rumba\\" entered the Spanish flamenco world as a fast-paced palo (style) inspired in the Cuban guaracha, and which gave rise to other forms of urban music now known as \\"rumba\\". Throughout Latin America, \\"rumba\\" acquired different connotations, mostly referring to Cubanized, danceable, local styles, such as Colombian rumba criolla (creole rumba). At the same time, \\"rumba\\" began to be used a catch-all term for Afro-Cuban music in most African countries, later giving rise to re-Africanized Cuban-based styles such as Congolese rumba. In Cuba During the second half of the 19th century, several secular dance-oriented music styles were developed by Afro-Cuban workers in the poor neighbourhoods of Havana and Matanzas. These syncretic styles would later be referred to as \\"rumba\\", a word that also meant \\"party\\". Traditionally, the three main styles of rumba are yamb√∫, columbia and guaguanc√≥, each of which has a characteristic dance, rhythm and singing. Although still a purely folkloric genre, numerous innovations have been introduced in rumba since the mid 20th century, including new styles such as bat√°-rumba and guarapachangueo. In North America In the US, the term \\"rhumba\\" (anglicised version of rumba), began to be used during the 1920s to refer to ballroom music with Afro-Cuban music themes, particularly in the context of big band music. This music was mostly inspired by son cubano, while being rhythmically and instrumentally unrelated to Cuban rumba. By the 1930s, with the release of \\"The Peanut Vendor\\", the genre had become highly-successful and well-defined. The rhumba dance that developed on the East Coast of the United States was based on the bolero-son. The first rumba competition took place in the Savoy Ballroom in 1930. Nowadays, two different styles of ballroom rumba coexist: American-style and International-style. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Mexican and American film industry expanded the use of the term rumba as rumbera films became popular. In this context, rumberas were Cuban and Mexican divas, singers and actresses who sang boleros and canciones, but rarely rumbas. Notable rumberas include Rita Montaner, Rosa Carmina, Mar√≠a Antonieta Pons and Nin√≥n Sevilla. In the 1970s, with the emergence of salsa as a popular music and dance genre in the US, rhythmic elements of Cuban rumba (particularly guaguanc√≥) became prevalent alongside the son. Like salsa, rhumba would then be danced to salsa ensembles instead of big bands. By the end of the 20th century, rhumba was also danced to pop music and jazz bands as seen in TV shows like Dancing with the Stars. In Spain In Spain, the term rumba was introduced in the early 20th century as rumba flamenca, one of the palos (styles) of flamenco. Particularly, it is considered one of the cantes de ida y vuelta, since flamenco itself might have had an influence on Cuban rumba, particularly on its vocal style. However, musicologists agree that rumba flamenca does not truly derive from Cuban rumba, but from guaracha, a fast-paced music style from Havana. Apart from rumba flamenca, other syncretic styles of Afro-Cuban origin have been named \\"rumba\\" throughout the Iberian peninsula, outside of the context of flamenco (where the term cantes de ida y vuelta is mostly restricted), such as the Galician rumba. In the late 1950s, popular artists such as Peret (El Rey de la Rumba) and El Pesca√≠lla developed an uptempo style that combined elements from rumba flamenca, Spanish gypsy music and pop. This became known as Catalan rumba (rumba catalana).Mart√≠nez & Fouce (2013). p. 21. In the 1980s, the style gained international popularity thanks to French ensemble Gipsy Kings. In the 1990s, the term ‚Äútecno-rumba‚Äù was used to describe the music of Camela, and later Az√∫car Moreno. Since the early 2000s, the term rumba has been used in Spain to refer to derivatives of Catalan rumba with hip hop and rock elements, as recorded by Estopa, Huecco and Melendi. In Colombia In the late 1930s and early 1940s, a fusion of bambuco and Afro-Cuban music was developed in Colombia by artists such as Emilio Sierra, Milciades Garavito, and Di√≥genes Chaves Pinz√≥n, under the name rumba criolla (creole rumba). Rumba criolla is classified into different regional styles such as rumba antioque√±a and rumba tolimense. In Africa In the 1930s and 1940s, Afro-Cuban son groups such as Septeto Habanero, Trio Matamoros and Los Guaracheros de Oriente were played over Radio Congo Belge in L√©opoldville (Kinshasa), gaining widespread popularity in the country during the following decades. Their recordings were also made available to the public as part of the G.V. Series of 10\\" singles released by His Master's Voice throughout Africa. Once local bands tried to emulate the sound of Cuban son (incorrectly referred to as \\"rumba\\" in Africa, despite being unrelated to Cuban rumba), their music became known as Congolese rumba or rumba Lingala. By the late 1960s, Congolese rumba was an established genre in most of Central Africa, and it would also impact the music of West and East Africa. Franco's OK Jazz and Le Grand Kall√©'s African Jazz were amongst the most successful Congolese rumba ensembles of the 20th century. A faster subgenre known as soukous (from the French word secouer, \\"to shake\\") was developed in the late 1960s by bands such as African Fiesta and is often used as a synonym of the former.

In certain organisms, these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream. Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down: mechanical and chemical digestion. The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes. In chemical digestion, enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use. In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. In infants and toddlers gastric juice also contains rennin. As the first two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes. After some time (typically 1‚Äì2 hours in humans, 4‚Äì6 hours in dogs, 3‚Äì4 hours in house cats), the resulting thick liquid is called chyme. When the pyloric sphincter valve opens, chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine, in which digestion continues. When the chyme is fully digested, it is absorbed into the blood. 95% of nutrient absorption occurs in the small intestine. Water and minerals are reabsorbed back into the blood in the colon (large intestine) where the pH is slightly acidic about 5.6 ~ 6.9. Some vitamins, such as biotin and vitamin K (K2MK7) produced by bacteria in the colon are also absorbed into the blood in the colon. Waste material is eliminated from the rectum during defecation. Digestive system Digestive systems take many forms. There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion. External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history, and most fungi still rely on it.Dusenbery, David B. (1996). ‚ÄúLife at Small Scale‚Äù, pp. 113‚Äì115. Scientific American Library, New York. . In this process, enzymes are secreted into the environment surrounding the organism, where they break down an organic material, and some of the products diffuse back to the organism. Animals have a tube (gastrointestinal tract) in which internal digestion occurs, which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured, and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled.Dusenbery, David B. (2009). Living at Micro Scale, p. 280. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA . Some organisms, including nearly all spiders, simply secrete biotoxins and digestive chemicals (e.g., enzymes) into the extracellular environment prior to ingestion of the consequent \\"soup\\". In others, once potential nutrients or food is inside the organism, digestion can be conducted to a vesicle or a sac-like structure, through a tube, or through several specialized organs aimed at making the absorption of nutrients more efficient. Schematic drawing of bacterial conjugation. 1- Donor cell produces pilus. 2- Pilus attaches to recipient cell, bringing the two cells together. 3- The mobile plasmid is nicked and a single strand of DNA is transferred to the recipient cell. 4- Both cells recircularize their plasmids, synthesize second strands, and reproduce pili; both cells are now viable donors. =Secretion systems= Bacteria use several systems to obtain nutrients from other organisms in the environments. Channel transport system In a channel transupport system, several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria. It is a simple system, which consists of only three protein subunits: the ABC protein, membrane fusion protein (MFP), and outer membrane protein (OMP). This secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20‚Äì900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small Escherichia coli peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the Pseudomonas fluorescens cell adhesion protein LapA of 900 kDa. Molecular syringe A type III secretion system means that a molecular syringe is used through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia) can inject nutrients into protist cells. One such mechanism was first discovered in Y. pestis and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.Salyers, A.A. & Whitt, D.D. (2002). Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach, 2nd ed., Washington, DC: ASM Press. Conjugation machinery The conjugation machinery of some bacteria (and archaeal flagella) is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which uses this system to introduce the Ti plasmid and proteins into the host, which develops the crown gall (tumor). The VirB complex of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is the prototypic system. The nitrogen fixing Rhizobia are an interesting case, wherein conjugative elements naturally engage in inter-kingdom conjugation. Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells. Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines, which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources. Infected plant cells form crown gall or root tumors. The Ti and Ri plasmids are thus endosymbionts of the bacteria, which are in turn endosymbionts (or parasites) of the infected plant. The Ti and Ri plasmids are themselves conjugative. Ti and Ri transfer between bacteria uses an independent system (the tra, or transfer, operon) from that for inter-kingdom transfer (the vir, or virulence, operon). Such transfer creates virulent strains from previously avirulent Agrobacteria. Release of outer membrane vesicles In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of outer membrane vesicles. Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials. Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective. Venus Flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) leaf =Gastrovascular cavity= The gastrovascular cavity functions as a stomach in both digestion and the distribution of nutrients to all parts of the body. Extracellular digestion takes place within this central cavity, which is lined with the gastrodermis, the internal layer of epithelium. This cavity has only one opening to the outside that functions as both a mouth and an anus: waste and undigested matter is excreted through the mouth/anus, which can be described as an incomplete gut. In a plant such as the Venus Flytrap that can make its own food through photosynthesis, it does not eat and digest its prey for the traditional objectives of harvesting energy and carbon, but mines prey primarily for essential nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus in particular) that are in short supply in its boggy, acidic habitat. Trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica with ingested erythrocytes =Phagosome= A phagosome is a vacuole formed around a particle absorbed by phagocytosis. The vacuole is formed by the fusion of the cell membrane around the particle. A phagosome is a cellular compartment in which pathogenic microorganisms can be killed and digested. Phagosomes fuse with lysosomes in their maturation process, forming phagolysosomes. In humans, Entamoeba histolytica can phagocytose red blood cells. =Specialised organs and behaviours= To aid in the digestion of their food animals evolved organs such as beaks, tongues, teeth, a crop, gizzard, and others. Beaks Birds have bony beaks that are specialised according to the bird's ecological niche. For example, macaws primarily eat seeds, nuts, and fruit, using their impressive beaks to open even the toughest seed. First they scratch a thin line with the sharp point of the beak, then they shear the seed open with the sides of the beak. The mouth of the squid is equipped with a sharp horny beak mainly made of cross-linked proteins. It is used to kill and tear prey into manageable pieces. The beak is very robust, but does not contain any minerals, unlike the teeth and jaws of many other organisms, including marine species. The beak is the only indigestible part of the squid. Tongue The tongue is skeletal muscle on the floor of the mouth of most vertebrates, that manipulates food for chewing (mastication) and swallowing (deglutition). It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva. The underside of the tongue is covered with a smooth mucous membrane. The tongue also has a touch sense for locating and positioning food particles that require further chewing. The tongue is utilized to roll food particles into a bolus before being transported down the esophagus through peristalsis. The sublingual region underneath the front of the tongue is a location where the oral mucosa is very thin, and underlain by a plexus of veins. This is an ideal location for introducing certain medications to the body. The sublingual route takes advantage of the highly vascular quality of the oral cavity, and allows for the speedy application of medication into the cardiovascular system, bypassing the gastrointestinal tract. Teeth Teeth (singular tooth) are small whitish structures found in the jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates that are used to tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, dentine and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying. The shapes, sizes and numbers of types of animals' teeth are related to their diets. For example, herbivores have a number of molars which are used to grind plant matter, which is difficult to digest. Carnivores have canine teeth which are used to kill and tear meat. Crop A crop, or croup, is a thin-walled expanded portion of the alimentary tract used for the storage of food prior to digestion. In some birds it is an expanded, muscular pouch near the gullet or throat. In adult doves and pigeons, the crop can produce crop milk to feed newly hatched birds. Certain insects may have a crop or enlarged esophagus. Rough illustration of a ruminant digestive system Abomasum Herbivores have evolved cecums (or an abomasum in the case of ruminants). Ruminants have a fore-stomach with four chambers. These are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum. In the first two chambers, the rumen and the reticulum, the food is mixed with saliva and separates into layers of solid and liquid material. Solids clump together to form the cud (or bolus). The cud is then regurgitated, chewed slowly to completely mix it with saliva and to break down the particle size. Fibre, especially cellulose and hemi-cellulose, is primarily broken down into the volatile fatty acids, acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in these chambers (the reticulo-rumen) by microbes: (bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). In the omasum, water and many of the inorganic mineral elements are absorbed into the blood stream. The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants. It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach (e.g., those in humans or pigs), and digesta is processed here in much the same way. It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein, preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine. Digesta is finally moved into the small intestine, where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. Microbes produced in the reticulo-rumen are also digested in the small intestine. A flesh fly \\"blowing a bubble\\", possibly to concentrate its food by evaporating water Specialised behaviours Regurgitation has been mentioned above under abomasum and crop, referring to crop milk, a secretion from the lining of the crop of pigeons and doves with which the parents feed their young by regurgitation. Many sharks have the ability to turn their stomachs inside out and evert it out of their mouths in order to get rid of unwanted contents (perhaps developed as a way to reduce exposure to toxins). Other animals, such as rabbits and rodents, practise coprophagia behaviours ‚Äì eating specialised faeces in order to re-digest food, especially in the case of roughage. Capybara, rabbits, hamsters and other related species do not have a complex digestive system as do, for example, ruminants. Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut. Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately. They also produce normal droppings, which are not eaten. Young elephants, pandas, koalas, and hippos eat the faeces of their mother, probably to obtain the bacteria required to properly digest vegetation. When they are born, their intestines do not contain these bacteria (they are completely sterile). Without them, they would be unable to get any nutritional value from many plant components. =In earthworms= An earthworm's digestive system consists of a mouth, pharynx, esophagus, crop, gizzard, and intestine. The mouth is surrounded by strong lips, which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass, leaves, and weeds, with bits of soil to help chew. The lips break the food down into smaller pieces. In the pharynx, the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage. The esophagus adds calcium carbonate to neutralize the acids formed by food matter decay. Temporary storage occurs in the crop where food and calcium carbonate are mixed. The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt. When the churning is complete, the glands in the walls of the gizzard add enzymes to the thick paste, which helps chemically breakdown the organic matter. By peristalsis, the mixture is sent to the intestine where friendly bacteria continue chemical breakdown. This releases carbohydrates, protein, fat, and various vitamins and minerals for absorption into the body. Overview of vertebrate digestion In most vertebrates, digestion is a multistage process in the digestive system, starting from ingestion of raw materials, most often other organisms. Ingestion usually involves some type of mechanical and chemical processing. Digestion is separated into four steps: # Ingestion: placing food into the mouth (entry of food in the digestive system), # Mechanical and chemical breakdown: mastication and the mixing of the resulting bolus with water, acids, bile and enzymes in the stomach and intestine to break down complex molecules into simple structures, # Absorption: of nutrients from the digestive system to the circulatory and lymphatic capillaries through osmosis, active transport, and diffusion, and # Egestion (Excretion): Removal of undigested materials from the digestive tract through defecation. Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis. Each step in digestion requires energy, and thus imposes an \\"overhead charge\\" on the energy made available from absorbed substances. Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle, behavior, and even physical structures. Examples may be seen in humans, who differ considerably from other hominids (lack of hair, smaller jaws and musculature, different dentition, length of intestines, cooking, etc.). The major part of digestion takes place in the small intestine. The large intestine primarily serves as a site for fermentation of indigestible matter by gut bacteria and for resorption of water from digests before excretion. In mammals, preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach. Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed, and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches. The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes. Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract, and the process finishes with defecation. Human digestion process The human gastrointestinal tract is around 9 meters long. Food digestion physiology varies between individuals and upon other factors such as the characteristics of the food and size of the meal, and the process of digestion normally takes between 24 and 72 hours. Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes. Food is formed into a bolus by the mechanical mastication and swallowed into the esophagus from where it enters the stomach through the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection. In the stomach further release of enzymes break down the food further and this is combined with the churning action of the stomach. The partially digested food enters the duodenum as a thick semi-liquid chyme. In the small intestine, the larger part of digestion takes place and this is helped by the secretions of bile, pancreatic juice and intestinal juice. The intestinal walls are lined with villi, and their epithelial cells is covered with numerous microvilli to improve the absorption of nutrients by increasing the surface area of the intestine. In the large intestine the passage of food is slower to enable fermentation by the gut flora to take place. Here water is absorbed and waste material stored as feces to be removed by defecation via the anal canal and anus. = Neural and biochemical control mechanisms = Different phases of digestion take place including: the cephalic phase, gastric phase, and intestinal phase. The cephalic phase occurs at the sight, thought and smell of food, which stimulate the cerebral cortex. Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata. After this it is routed through the vagus nerve and release of acetylcholine. Gastric secretion at this phase rises to 40% of maximum rate. Acidity in the stomach is not buffered by food at this point and thus acts to inhibit parietal (secretes acid) and G cell (secretes gastrin) activity via D cell secretion of somatostatin. The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours. It is stimulated by distension of the stomach, presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes. This activates the release of acetylcholine, which stimulates the release of more gastric juices. As protein enters the stomach, it binds to hydrogen ions, which raises the pH of the stomach. Inhibition of gastrin and gastric acid secretion is lifted. This triggers G cells to release gastrin, which in turn stimulates parietal cells to secrete gastric acid. Gastric acid is about 0.5% hydrochloric acid (HCl), which lowers the pH to the desired pH of 1‚Äì3. Acid release is also triggered by acetylcholine and histamine. The intestinal phase has two parts, the excitatory and the inhibitory. Partially digested food fills the duodenum. This triggers intestinal gastrin to be released. Enterogastric reflex inhibits vagal nuclei, activating sympathetic fibers causing the pyloric sphincter to tighten to prevent more food from entering, and inhibits local reflexes. Breakdown into nutrients=Protein digestion= Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes, pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas, break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various exopeptidases and dipeptidases into amino acids. The digestive enzymes however are mostly secreted as their inactive precursors, the zymogens. For example, trypsin is secreted by pancreas in the form of trypsinogen, which is activated in the duodenum by enterokinase to form trypsin. Trypsin then cleaves proteins to smaller polypeptides. =Fat digestion= Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides. However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine.Digestion of fats (triacylglycerols) The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids. Complete digestion of one molecule of fat (a triglyceride) results a mixture of fatty acids, mono- and di-glycerides, as well as some undigested triglycerides, but no free glycerol molecules. =Carbohydrate digestion= In humans, dietary starches are composed of glucose units arranged in long chains called amylose, a polysaccharide. During digestion, bonds between glucose molecules are broken by salivary and pancreatic amylase, resulting in progressively smaller chains of glucose. This results in simple sugars glucose and maltose (2 glucose molecules) that can be absorbed by the small intestine. Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts, glucose and galactose. Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine. Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk-based foods. This is commonly known as lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance varies widely by genetic heritage; more than 90 percent of peoples of east Asian descent are lactose intolerant, in contrast to about 5 percent of people of northern European descent. Sucrase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide sucrose, commonly known as table sugar, cane sugar, or beet sugar. Sucrose digestion yields the sugars fructose and glucose which are readily absorbed by the small intestine. =DNA and RNA digestion= DNA and RNA are broken down into mononucleotides by the nucleases deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease (DNase and RNase) from the pancreas. Non-destructive digestion Some nutrients are complex molecules (for example vitamin B12) which would be destroyed if they were broken down into their functional groups. To digest vitamin B12 non- destructively, haptocorrin in saliva strongly binds and protects the B12 molecules from stomach acid as they enter the stomach and are cleaved from their protein complexes. After the B12-haptocorrin complexes pass from the stomach via the pylorus to the duodenum, pancreatic proteases cleave haptocorrin from the B12 molecules which rebind to intrinsic factor (IF). These B12-IF complexes travel to the ileum portion of the small intestine where cubilin receptors enable assimilation and circulation of B12-IF complexes in the blood. Digestive hormones Action of the major digestive hormones There are at least five hormones that aid and regulate the digestive system in mammals. There are variations across the vertebrates, as for instance in birds. Arrangements are complex and additional details are regularly discovered. For instance, more connections to metabolic control (largely the glucose-insulin system) have been uncovered in recent years. * Gastrin ‚Äì is in the stomach and stimulates the gastric glands to secrete pepsinogen (an inactive form of the enzyme pepsin) and hydrochloric acid. Secretion of gastrin is stimulated by food arriving in stomach. The secretion is inhibited by low pH. * Secretin ‚Äì is in the duodenum and signals the secretion of sodium bicarbonate in the pancreas and it stimulates the bile secretion in the liver. This hormone responds to the acidity of the chyme. * Cholecystokinin (CCK) ‚Äì is in the duodenum and stimulates the release of digestive enzymes in the pancreas and stimulates the emptying of bile in the gall bladder. This hormone is secreted in response to fat in chyme. * Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) ‚Äì is in the duodenum and decreases the stomach churning in turn slowing the emptying in the stomach. Another function is to induce insulin secretion. * Motilin ‚Äì is in the duodenum and increases the migrating myoelectric complex component of gastrointestinal motility and stimulates the production of pepsin. Significance of pH Digestion is a complex process controlled by several factors. pH plays a crucial role in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary amylase is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment. The stomach's high acidity inhibits the breakdown of carbohydrates within it. This acidity confers two benefits: it denatures proteins for further digestion in the small intestines, and provides non-specific immunity, damaging or eliminating various pathogens. In the small intestines, the duodenum provides critical pH balancing to activate digestive enzymes. The liver secretes bile into the duodenum to neutralize the acidic conditions from the stomach, and the pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum, adding bicarbonate to neutralize the acidic chyme, thus creating a neutral environment. The mucosal tissue of the small intestines is alkaline with a pH of about 8.5.

At least four different meanings are recognized. In the historically first sense, the name may refer to several versions of the waltz, including the earliest waltzes done in ballroom dancing, danced to the music of Viennese waltz. What is now called the Viennese waltz is the original form of the waltz. It was the first ballroom dance performed in the closed hold or \\"waltz\\" position. The dance that is popularly known as the waltz is actually the English or slow waltz, danced at approximately 90 beats per minute with 3 beats to the bar (the international standard of 30 measures per minute), while the Viennese waltz is danced at about 180 beats (58-60 measures) per minute. To this day however, in Germany, Austria, Scandinavia, and France, the words (German), (Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish), and (French) still implicitly refer to the original dance and not the slow waltz. The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either toward the leader's right (natural) or toward the leader's left (reverse), interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. As the waltz evolved, some of the versions that were done at about the original fast tempo came to be called specifically \\"Viennese waltz\\" to distinguish them from the slower waltzes. In the modern ballroom dance, two versions of Viennese waltz are recognized: International Style and American Style. Today the Viennese waltz is a ballroom and partner dance that is part of the International Standard division of contemporary ballroom dance.  History = Early history = The Viennese waltz, so called to distinguish it from the waltz and the French waltz, is the oldest of the current ballroom dances. It emerged in the second half of the 18th century from the German dance and the L√§ndler in Austria and was both popular and subject to criticism. At that time, the waltz, as described in a magazine from 1799, was performed by dancers who held on to their long gowns to prevent them from dragging or being stepped on. The dancers would lift their dresses and hold them high like cloaks, and this would bring both their bodies under one cover. This action also required the dancers' bodies to be very close together, and this closeness attracted moral disparagement. In 1797, Wolf published a pamphlet against the dance entitled \\"Proof that Waltzing is the Main Source of Weakness of the Body and Mind of our Generation\\". But even when faced with all this negativity, it became very popular in Vienna. Large dance halls like the Zum Sperl in 1807 and the Apollo in 1808 were opened to provide space for thousands of dancers. The dance reached and spread to England sometime before 1812. It was introduced as the German waltz and became a huge hit. It gained ground through the Congress of Vienna at the beginning of the 19th century and by the famous compositions by Josef Lanner, Johann Strauss I and his son, Johann Strauss II. Early waltz steps, 1816 from Thomas Wilson Treatise on Waltzing Initially, the waltz was significantly different from its form today. In the first place, the couples did not dance in the closed position as today. The illustrations and descriptions make it clear that the couples danced with arm positions similar to that of the precursor dances, the L√§ndler and the Allemande.Richardson P.J.S. 1960. Social dances of the 19th century in England. p44Sachs, Curt. 1937. World History of the Dance. Norton.Quirey, Belinda 1976. May I have the pleasure? The story of popular dancing. p. 66; \\"The Century of Waltz\\". The hold was at times semi- closed and at times side by side. Arms were intertwined and circling movements were made under raised arms. No couple in Wilson's plate are shown in close embrace, but some are in closed hold facing each other. Another significant difference from the present technique was that the feet were turned out and the rise of foot during the dance was much more pronounced. This can be seen quite clearly in the figure, and such a style imposes its limitations on how the dance can be performed. To understand why Quirey says \\"The advent of the in polite society was quite simply the greatest change in dance form and dancing manners that has happened in our history\\" we need to realize that all European social dances before the waltz were communal sequence dances ‚Äì communal, because all the dancers on the floor took part in a preset pattern (often chosen by a master of ceremony. Dancers separately, and as couples, faced outwards to the spectators as much as they faced inwards. Thus all present took part as dancers or as onlookers. This was the way with the country dance and all previous popular dances. With the waltz, couples were independent of each other and were turned towards each other (though not in close contact). Lord Byron wrote a furious letter, which precedes his poem \\"The Waltz\\", in which he decries the anti-social nature of the dance, with the couple \\"like two cockchafers spitted on the same bodkin.\\"Richardson P.J.S. 1960. Social dances of the 19th century in England. p63  Technique and styles  The Viennese waltz is a rotary dance where the dancers are constantly turning either in a clockwise (\\"natural\\") or counter-clockwise (\\"reverse\\") direction interspersed with non-rotating change steps to switch between the direction of rotation. A true Viennese waltz consists only of turns and change steps. Other moves such as the fleckerls, American-style figures and side sway or underarm turns are modern inventions. The competitive styles of Viennese waltz has a reduced number of steps, depending on the style and competition level or medal exam level. = International-style Viennese waltz = International-style Viennese waltz is danced in closed position. The syllabus is limited to natural and reverse turns, closed and open changes, fleckerls, contra check, left whisk, and canter-time pivot turns (canter pivots). In World Dance Council competition, canter pivots are excluded. = American-style Viennese waltz = American-style Viennese waltz has much more freedom, both in dance positions and syllabus.

It caters for pupils aged 11 to 16 and is English-medium. As of September 2015, the headteacher is Chris Norman. He succeeded Joy Ballard, under whom the proportion of pupils attaining five A*-C grades rose from 14% to 50%. In recent years, Willows has been oversubscribed for pupils.  History  The school site is extensive and dates from the late 1960s, and was built on the site of the World War II airfield RAF Pengam Moors. The school is named after the air balloon pioneer Ernest Willows who had his airfield on the site. Many of the buildings have since been modernised. There are plans to continue this modernisation in the future, including with a PFI agreement as part of plans by Cardiff Council. A completely new building is planned, which could be located in nearby Tremorfa Park. The site proposed originally included St. Alban's Primary School, which was slated to close. However, in 2019 the closure was successfully petitioned, and stopped in 2020. The school featured in the 2015 Channel 4 documentary Educating Cardiff. This detailed every aspect of school life, and also highlighted many of the improvements the school has made in recent years. Starting in 2015, Willows participated in the South Wales Challenge (SWC) Initiative, sharing best-practice in education with Tonyrefail School, Rhondda Cynon Taf. This aimed to help the school to improve academic standards further. Estyn Inspections In 2012, Estyn rated the school as \\"unsatisfactory\\", reporting that it needed \\"significant improvement\\". The inspectors reported that, although pupils often had unsatisfactory English grammar and literacy skills, leadership was \\"adequate\\" and there were real prospects of improvement. The school substantially improved after this, and by 2014 no longer requires significant improvement. However, the more recent 2018 has found there are still many aspects of school life that could be improved, particularly in the methods of teaching and leadership. Despite this, the school had improved enough that in 2019 it was removed from monitoring by Estyn. There were 586 pupils at the school during the 2018 Estyn inspection, a significant drop since the 2012 inspection. The proportion of pupils receiving free school meals is 44%, which is much higher than the national average of 17.4%. Almost two-thirds of the pupils live in the 20% most deprived areas in Wales. Around 8% of pupils have English as an additional language. Twenty-nine per cent of the pupils come from minority ethnic backgrounds.

Similar to his female counterpart, Ken has a fashionable line of clothing and accessories. In the Barbie mythos, Ken met Barbie on the set of a TV commercial. He is Barbie‚Äôs boyfriend, as it is written on every box produced since 1961. Since his debut, Ken has held at least 40 occupations. He was invented by Elliot Handler. Overview From 1961 to the debut of Superstar Ken in 1977, Ken had straight, nonbendable arms and a head that could only turn left and right. Ken's hair was made of felt in his first year (known to collectors as the \\"flocked\\" hair Ken), but this was replaced with a plastic, molded hairstyle when the felt hair was found to fall off when wet. Superstar Ken featured a dimpled smile, a head that could swivel, bent arms, a more muscular physique, jewelry, and underwear permanently molded to his body. The woman who made the Ken doll made it to resemble her husband. Ken's best friend, Allan Sherwood (Midge's boyfriend, later husband), was introduced in 1964. The first African- American male doll, Brad, was introduced in 1968, as the boyfriend of Barbie's African-American friend, Christie, who was introduced in 1967. Brad was voiced by actor Terry Carter. The unrealistic physiques of Barbie and Ken caused comment. Although Ken is thought to stand 6-feet tall in accordance with Barbie's 1:6 scale, Yale University psychologist, Kelly Brownell, stated that to size up to what Barbie looks for in a mate, \\"a man would have to grow 20 inches taller and add nearly eight inches to his neck circumference, 11 inches to his chest and 10 inches to his waist to resemble the muscular Ken.\\"Concordia University Library (Montreal, Canada) In 1993, \\"Earring Magic Ken\\" was released.

In February, 2004, Mattel announced a split for Ken and Barbie, with Russell Arons, vice president of marketing at Mattel, saying that Barbie and Ken \\"feel it's time to spend some quality time ‚Äì apart...Like other celebrity couples, their Hollywood romance has come to an end\\", though Arons indicated that the duo would \\"remain friends\\".

The pair officially reunited in Valentine's Day 2011. Like Barbie, Ken is named after one of Ruth Handler's children, Ken Handler, who died in 1994 of a brain tumor. In January 2009, the media reported on the publication of a book entitled Toy Monster: The Big, Bad World of Mattel by Jerry Oppenheimer. In the book, Oppenheimer claims that Ken Handler \\"grew up embarrassed and humiliated by having an anatomically incorrect boy doll named after him with no hint of genitalia.\\" In October 2009, Mattel announced a new Palm Beach line which included a Sugar Daddy Ken doll aimed for adult collectors. The said line officially debuted in the spring of 2010. The line proved to be controversial, because of Ken's suggestive-sounding name. The doll had a more mature appearance and came with a West Highland Terrier puppy. Mattel defended the doll's name, saying that the puppy's name is \\"Sugar\\", thus making Ken \\"Sugar's Daddy\\". Media He was also in the 2010 Pixar film Toy Story 3, voiced by Michael Keaton. He was one of the henchmen of the film's villain Lotso. In 2011, Mattel introduced Japan Ken, the first Ken doll to be included in the Dolls of the World collection, which was formerly a Barbie-only line. The Japan Ken doll features a new face sculpt. In Mattel's official Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse web series, Ken's personality was greatly expounded on. Most notably, his love for inventing. =Names= Ken's personal name is Kenneth Sean Carson. His given name comes from Elliot Handler's son. In the 1960s Random House books, his surname is Carson. According to Mattel, his middle name is Sean.

Georges Seurat and Paul Signac developed the technique in 1886, branching from Impressionism. The term \\"Pointillism\\" was coined by art critics in the late 1880s to ridicule the works of these artists, but is now used without its earlier mocking connotation. The movement Seurat began with this technique is known as Neo-impressionism. The Divisionists used a similar technique of patterns to form images, though with larger cube-like brushstrokes.Ruhrberg, Karl. \\"Seurat and the Neo-Impressionists\\". Art of the 20th Century, Vol. 2. Koln: Benedikt Taschen Verlag, 1998. .  Technique  The technique relies on the ability of the eye and mind of the viewer to blend the color spots into a fuller range of tones. It is related to Divisionism, a more technical variant of the method. Divisionism is concerned with color theory, whereas pointillism is more focused on the specific style of brushwork used to apply the paint. It is a technique with few serious practitioners today and is notably seen in the works of Seurat, Signac and Cross. However, see also Andy Warhol's early works and Pop Art. Paul Signac, Femmes au Puits, 1892, showing a detail with constituent colors. Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris Henri-Edmond Cross, L'air du soir, c.1893, Mus√©e d'Orsay From 1905 to 1907, Robert Delaunay and Jean Metzinger painted in a Divisionist style with large squares or 'cubes' of color: the size and direction of each gave a sense of rhythm to the painting, yet color varied independently of size and placement.Jean Metzinger, ca. 1907, quoted in Georges Desvalli√®res, La Grande Revue, vol. 124, 1907, as cited in Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York This form of Divisionism was a significant step beyond the preoccupations of Signac and Cross. In 1906, the art critic Louis Chassevent recognized the difference and, as art historian Daniel Robbins pointed out, used the word \\"cube\\" which would later be taken up by Louis Vauxcelles to baptize Cubism. Chassevent writes: :\\"M. Metzinger is a mosaicist like M. Signac but he brings more precision to the cutting of his cubes of color which appear to have been made mechanically [...]\\".Robert L. Herbert, 1968, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New YorkLouis Chassevent: Les Artistes ind√©pendantes, 1906Louis Chassevent, 22e Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1906, Quelques petits salons, Paris, 1908, p. 32Daniel Robbins, 1964, Albert Gleizes 1881 ‚Äì 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund  Practice  The practice of Pointillism is in sharp contrast to the traditional methods of blending pigments on a palette. Pointillism is analogous to the four-color CMYK printing process used by some color printers and large presses that place dots of cyan, magenta, yellow and key (black). Televisions and computer monitors use a similar technique to represent image colors using Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) colors.Vivien Greene, Divisionism, Neo-Impressionism: Arcadia & Anarchy, Guggenheim Museum Publications, 2007, If red, blue, and green light (the additive primaries) are mixed, the result is something close to white light (see Prism (optics)). Painting is inherently subtractive, but Pointillist colors often seem brighter than typical mixed subtractive colors. This may be partly because subtractive mixing of the pigments is avoided, and because some of the white canvas may be showing between the applied dots. The painting technique used for Pointillist color mixing is at the expense of the traditional brushwork used to delineate texture. The majority of Pointillism is done in oil paint. Anything may be used in its place, but oils are preferred for their thickness and tendency not to run or bleed.  Common uses of Pointillism  Pointill√© is commonly used for intricate binding of hand- made book covers in the seventeenth century, the decoration of metallic arms and armor, and for the decoration of hand-finished firearms.  Music  Pointillism also refers to a style of 20th-century music composition. Different musical notes are made in seclusion, rather than in a linear sequence, giving a sound texture similar to the painting version of Pointillism. This type of music is also known as punctualism or klangfarbenmelodie.  Notable artists  Vincent van Gogh, Self Portrait, 1887, using pointillist technique.

Biography Paul Signac was born in Paris on 11 November 1863. He followed a course of training in architecture before, at the age of 18, deciding to pursue a career as a painter, after attending an exhibit of Monet's work. He sailed on the Mediterranean Sea, visiting the coasts of Europe and painting the landscapes he encountered. In later years, he also painted a series of watercolors of French harbor cities.

He was struck by the systematic working methods of Seurat and by his theory of colors and he became Seurat's faithful supporter, friend, and heir with his description of Neo-Impressionism and Divisionism method.Ruhberg Kark, Art of the 20th Century Benedikt Taschen Verlag GMBH 1998 Under Seurat's influence he abandoned the short brushstrokes of Impressionism to experiment with scientifically-juxtaposed small dots of pure color, intended to combine and blend not on the canvas, but in the viewer's eye, the defining feature of Pointillism. Many of Signac's paintings are of the French coast. He loved to paint the water. He left the capital each summer, to stay in the south of France in the village of Collioure or at St. Tropez, where he bought a house and invited his friends. Paul Signac, Albert Dubois-Pillet, Odilon Redon, and Georges Seurat were among the founders of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. The association began in Paris 29 July 1884 with the organization of massive exhibitions, embracing as their motto, \\"Neither jury nor awards\\" (Sans jury ni r√©compense). \\"The purpose of Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants‚Äîbased on the principle of abolishing admission jury‚Äîis to allow the artists to present their works to public judgement with complete freedom\\". For the following three decades their annual exhibitions flourished and set the trends in art of the early twentieth century.

During 1887 the two artists regularly went to Asni√®res-sur-Seine together, where they painted such subjects as river landscapes and caf√©s. Initially, van Gogh chiefly admired Signac's loose painting technique. In March 1889, Signac visited van Gogh at Arles. The next year he made a short trip to Italy, seeing Genoa, Florence, and Naples. In 1888, Signac discovered anarchist ideas by reading Elisee Reclus, Kropotkin, and Jean Grave, who all developed the ideas of anarchist communism. With his friends Angrand Cross, Maximilien Luce, and Camille Pissarro he contributed to Jean Grave's paper, Les Temps Nouveaux (New Times). The Port of Saint-Tropez, 1901, oil on canvas, 131 x 161.5 cm (51.6 x 63.6 in), National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo Signac loved sailing and began to travel in 1892, sailing a small boat to almost all the ports of France, to the Netherlands, and on the Mediterranean Sea as far as Constantinople, basing his boat at St. Tropez, which he later would make popular to other artists. From his various ports of call, Signac brought back vibrant, colorful watercolors, sketched rapidly from nature. From these sketches, he painted large studio canvases that are carefully composed of small, mosaic-like squares of color quite different from the tiny, variegated dots introduced and used by Seurat. Signac experimented with various media. As well as oil paintings and watercolors he made etchings, lithographs, and many pen-and-ink sketches composed of small, laborious dots. The Neo-Impressionists influenced the next generation: Signac inspired Henri Matisse and Andr√© Derain in particular, thus playing a decisive role in the evolution of Fauvism. Having prospered well, his financial support of the arts was considerable. As donations, he sent regular cheques and made a gift of his works for five lotteries between 1895 and 1912. Signac's 1893 painting, In the Time of Harmony originally was entitled, In the Time of Anarchy, but political repression targeting the anarchists in France at this time forced him to change the title before the work could be accepted by a gallery. The Lagoon of Saint Mark, Venice, 1905 oil on canvas, 129.5 x 162.6 cm, Chrysler Museum of Art At the 1905 Salon des Ind√©pendants, Henri Matisse exhibited the proto-Fauve painting Luxe, Calme et Volupt√©. The brightly colored composition was painted in 1904 after a summer spent working in St. Tropez on the French Riviera alongside the neo- Impressionist painters Henri-Edmond Cross and Paul Signac.UCLA Art Council et al. 1966, p. 11 The painting is Matisse's most important work in which he used the Divisionist technique advocated by Signac, which Matisse had adopted in 1898 after reading Signac's essay, d'Eug√®ne Delacroix au N√©o- Impressionnisme.Oxford Art Online, \\"Henri Matisse\\"Paul Signac, d'Eug√®ne Delacroix au N√©o-Impressionnisme, 1898 (Third edition 1921) Signac purchased the work after the 1905 Salon des Ind√©pendants. In 1908 Signac was elected president of the Twenty-fourth Salon des Ind√©pendants.Russell T. Clement, Les Fauves: A Sourcebook, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1994 As president of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants, from 1908 until his death, Signac encouraged younger artists by exhibiting the controversial works of the Fauves and the Cubists. He was the first patron to buy a painting by Matisse. Signac served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919 and 1954 to painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

The witnesses at the wedding were Alexandre Lemonier, Maximilien Luce, Camille Pissarro, and Georges Lecomte. In November 1897, the Signacs moved to a new apartment in the Castel B√©ranger, which was built by Hector Guimard. A little later, in December of the same year, they acquired a house in Saint-Tropez named, La Hune, where the painter had a vast studio constructed that he inaugurated on 16 August 1898. In September 1913, Signac rented a house at Antibes, where he took up residence with Jeanne Selmersheim- Desgrange. She gave birth to their daughter, Ginette, on 2 October 1913. Meanwhile, Signac left La Hune and the Castel Beranger apartment to Berthe and they remained friends for the rest of his life. On 6 April 1927, Signac formally adopted Ginette. His granddaughter, Fran√ßoise Cachin, was an art historian. Paul Signac died from sepsis in Paris on 15 August 1935 at the age of 71. His body was cremated and was interred three days later, on 18 August, at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Some of Paul Signac's his well-known paintings are: In the Time of Harmony, Femmes au puits, Port St. Tropez, The Papal Palace, and The Demolisher. In 2010, a previously unknown painting by Signac was discovered at a hotel that was preparing an exhibition of its many paintings. The in Volendam possesses approximately 1,400 works of art. Apparently, Signac used this painting to pay for his stay there in 1894. Valued now at ‚Ç¨100,000, the untitled harbour scene \\"used to hang off a rusty nail in the lobby\\".Collin, Branko. Paul Signac Painting Discovered in Volendam Hotel, 27 February 2010.  Author  Signac wrote several important works on the theory of art, among them, From Eug√®ne Delacroix to Neo-Impressionism, published in 1899. It is a monograph devoted to Johan Barthold Jongkind (1819‚Äì1891), and was published in 1927. He also authored several introductions to the catalogues of art exhibitions and many other writings yet to be published. Politically, he was an anarchist, as were many of his friends, including F√©lix F√©n√©on and Camille Pissarro.

Sfumato (, ) is a painting technique for softening the transition between colours, mimicking an area beyond what the human eye is focusing on, or the out-of-focus plane. Leonardo da Vinci was the most prominent practitioner of sfumato, based on his research in optics and human vision, and his experimentation with the camera obscura. He used it in many works, including the Virgin of the Rocks and in his famous painting of the Mona Lisa. He described sfumato as \\"without lines or borders, in the manner of smoke or beyond the focus plane\\". According to the theory of the art historian Marcia B. Hall, which has gained considerable acceptance,. Retrieved June 18, 2015. sfumato is one of four modes of painting colours available to Italian High Renaissance painters, along with cangiante, chiaroscuro, and unione.Hall, Marcia B., Rome (series \\"Artistic Centers of the Italian Renaissance\\"), pp.148-150, 2005, Cambridge University Press, 2005, , 9780521624459, google books Etymology The word sfumato comes from the Italian language and is derived from fumo (\\"smoke\\", \\"fume\\"). Sfumato translated into English means soft, vague or blurred. In Italian the word is often used as an adjective (like biondo sfumato for pale blonde hair) or as a verb (l'affare √® sfumato would mean \\"the deal has gone up in smoke\\"). The use of the term (unlike some others) dates back to the period.  Technique  The technique is a fine shading meant to produce a soft transition between colours and tones, in order to achieve a more believable image. It is most often used by making subtle gradations that do not include lines or borders, from areas of light to areas of dark. The technique was used not only to give an elusive and illusionistic rendering of the human face but also to create rich atmospheric effects. Leonardo da Vinci described the technique as blending colours, without the use of lines or borders \\"in the manner of smoke\\". thumb Practitioners Besides Leonardo and his followers the Leonardeschi, who often used it heavily, other prominent practitioners of sfumato included Correggio, Raphael and Giorgione. Raphael's Madonna of the Meadow is a famous example, particularly around Mary's face. The Leonardeschi include Bernardino Luini and Funisi.

D'Israeli was born in Cento, near Ferrara, then in the Papal States, now part of the Italian Republic, on 22 September 1730; and died at Stoke Newington, Middlesex, on 28 November 1816. He moved to England in 1748 and settled there as a merchant, although he did not take out papers of denization till 1801. Although a conforming Jew, and though contributing liberally towards the support of a synagogue, D'Israeli appears never to have cordially or intimately mixed with the community; only on one occasion did he serve in a minor office‚Äîthat of inspector of charity schools in the year 1782.Joseph Jacobs and Goodman Lipkind (1901-1906), Benjamin D'Israeli, Jewish Encyclopedia (New York: Funk and Wagnalls) D'Israeli married twice. Firstly, on 2 April 1756, he married Rebecca Mendez Furtado, a woman of Portuguese origin. They had a daughter called Rachel. Within a few months of Rebecca's death on 1 February 1765 he married secondly Sarah Siprut de Gabay Villareal, on 28 May 1765. Their only child Isaac D'Israeli was born the next year, on 11 May 1766.  Life  D'Israeli was born in Cento, near Ferrara, then part of the Papal States, on 22 September 1730, the son of Isaac Israeli. He was the eldest of three children. The other two were daughters, Rachel, born in 1741, and Venturina, born in 1745. Although his grandson later wrote of the family's roots in the Republic of Venice, it seems the family's only connection with that city was through these sisters, for the only records of the family in the archives of the Venetian Ghetto are of Venturina's death there in 1821 and of the death of Rachel in the register for 1837. Lord Beaconsfield, in the Memoir of his father, speaks of an elder brother of Benjamin, who was a banker in Venice and a friend of Sir Horace Mann, but according to Wolf (1902) this must be a mistake, for apart from the absence of any record of this brother, and of any mention of him in the minute and copious correspondence of Mann, the fact that Rachel and Venturina Israeli kept a girls' school in the Ghetto makes it very unlikely that they had a banker brother.Lucien Wolf (1902-5), the Disraeli family , Transactions and Miscellanies of the Jewish Historical Society of England, vol 5, pp.202-218 Of Isaac Israeli is noteworthy that he bore a name honoured in Jewry and that he married into a family of great antiquity and of considerable renown in Ferrara. He or his ancestors probably came from the Levant, where the Arabic name-form \\"Israeli\\" would find an environment more favourable to its survival than in Western Europe, where the Israelis of Toledo had long before assimilated themselves to the native Israels. It is not unlikely (according to Wolf), in view of the rarity of his patronymic, that he was of the family of the famous philosopher and court physician Ishac ibn Sulaiman El Israeli of Kairouan, who flourished in the tenth century, but this can only be conjectured. His wife, Rica or Eurichetta Rossi, was, however, unquestionably of the ancient family of Min-Haadumin, which traced its origin to one of the Jews led into captivity after the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus and Vespasian, and, at a later date, translated its Hebrew name into its literal Italian equivalent, \\"Dei Rossi\\". The Min-Haadumin were numerous in Ferrara, where Isaac Israeli spent his life, and it was in the capital of the former duchy that the most illustrious of the clan, Azaria dei Rossi, practised as a physician and wrote his remarkable Cyclop√¶dia of Bible Criticism, Meor Enayim, in the latter half of the sixteenth century. After a short apprenticeship in Modena, Isaac Israeli's son Benjamin emigrated to England in his eighteenth year. A strong impulse had been given to Anglo-Italian trade through the establishment, in 1740, of a branch of the great Venetian and Levantine banking house of Treves in London, and consequently Italians, chiefly Jews, were flocking into the country. From letters preserved by one of Benjamin Israeli's great-grandchildren, it is clear that the attraction which brought him to these shores had much less to do with the stability of the dynasty in Great Britain, by which Lord Beaconsfield has characteristically accounted for his migration, than with a humdrum, but entirely creditable, desire to find the best market for his knowledge of the straw bonnet trade. Moses Chaim Montefiore, the grandfather of Sir Moses Montefiore, also came to the country at much the same time for precisely the same reason. In both cases the prescience of the emigrants was justified, for a few years later, owing to the patronage of Maria and Elizabeth the \\"beautiful Misses Gunning\\", Italian straw bonnets associated with Livorno (\\"Leghorn\\") became the height of fashion. At first D'Israeli was employed at a moderate salary in the counting-house of Messrs. Joseph and Pellegrin Treves in Fenchurch Street. Here he made the acquaintance of Mr. Aaron Lara, a friend of the principals, and a prosperous City broker, who thought sufficiently well of him to introduce him to his family. In 1756 he married Aaron Lara's sister-in-law, Rebecca Mendes Furtado. She was the second daughter and fourth child of Gaspar Mendes Furtado (Portugal, Fund√£o, near 1695) and Clara Henriques de Lara, and was three years older than her husband. On his marriage with Rebecca Mendes Furtado, D'Israeli left the Messrs. Treves and established himself in New Broad Street as an Italian merchant, importing straw hats, marble, alum, currants, and similar merchandise. He soon found this occupation pall upon what his grandson calls his \\"ardent temperament\\", and in 1759 he obtained for himself an address at Sam's Coffee House, and devoted a large portion of his time to the more exciting operations of 'Change Alley. With capital, credit, and experience alike limited, it was not difficult to tell whither this was likely to lead. Within a few months he found himself in serious difficulties and beset with litigation. He resumed business, however, but with indifferent success, and, after struggling on for five more years, he suffered a further affliction in the loss of his wife. His fortunes were repaired by his second marriage, which took place in May 1765. The bride was Sarah Shiprut de Gabay Villareal, younger daughter of a prosperous city merchant, Isaac Syprut, whose mother had been a Villareal, and whose wife, Esther, was sister-in-law to Simon Calimani, then Chief Rabbi of Venice. The relationship must also have proved very useful to him in the City. At any rate, he soon became a man of substance. For ten years he prudently devoted himself to his import business, which he carried on at No. 5 Great St. Helens. In 1769 the business was also one of the sixteen leading coral merchants in London, an activity also closely connected with Treves bank, and Livorno.Cecil Roth (1941), A History of the Jews in England, ch. 10: The Reign of George III. Oxford University Press There also he established his private abode, until in 1783 he leased a large house in Baker Street, Enfield. The Stock Market, however, never ceased to attract him, and in 1776 he rented an office in Hamlin's Alley, Cornhill, and recommenced business there as an unlicensed broker. Three years later he took to himself two partners, and the firm became known as Messrs. D'Israeli, Stoke & Parkins. At the same time he continued his business at Great St. Helens, which was afterwards transferred to Little Winchester Street, and, in 1792, to Old Broad Street. His success is attested by the fact that the more respectable of the brokers, who had already organised the beginnings of the present Stock Exchange at New Jonathan's Coffee House, admitted him to their body, and afterwards elected him a member of their Committee for General Purposes. When, in 1801, it was resolved to build new premises at Capel Court (where the Stock Exchange remained until 1972), Mr. D'Israeli was appointed a member of the committee entrusted with the plan of conversion. He remained a member of the Stock Exchange until 1803, when he retired from business; but to the day of his death he retained an address at Tom's Coffee House, and was often seen in Cornhill, dabbling in stocks and shares. One of the most notable enterprises with which he was associated was an attempt to substitute English straw-plaiting for the finer Italian straws then used for the best hats and bonnets. He patented a process by which \\"a wood which is the growth of this kingdom\\" was to be so treated as to yield a plait in every way equal to the Leghorn straws. The enterprise does not seem to have proved successful. D'Israeli died in November 1816 at his house at 7 Church Row (which became Church Street), Stoke Newington, and was attended on his deathbed by a noted physician, Dr. John Aikin, who happened to be his neighbour. He left a fortune valued at ¬£35,000 (equivalent to ¬£ million in ).

Early blight, caused by Alternaria solani, is also often called \\"potato blight\\". Late blight was a major culprit in the 1840s European, the 1845 Irish, and the 1846 Highland potato famines. The organism can also infect some other members of the Solanaceae. The pathogen is favored by moist, cool environments: sporulation is optimal at 12‚Äì18 ¬∞C in water-saturated or nearly saturated environments, and zoospore production is favored at temperatures below 15 ¬∞C. Lesion growth rates are typically optimal at a slightly warmer temperature range of 20 to 24 ¬∞C. Etymology The genus name Phytophthora comes from the Greek ‚Äì(), meaning : \\"plant\\" ‚Äì plus the Greek (), meaning : \\"decay, ruin, perish\\". The species name infestans is the present participle of the Latin verb , meaning : \\"attacking, destroying\\", from which we get the word \\"to infest\\". The name Phytophthora infestans was coined in 1876 by the German mycologist Heinrich Anton de Bary (1831‚Äì1888).National Center for Biotechnology Information (USA): Taxonomy Browser: Phytophthora infestans Life cycle, signs and symptoms Ripe tomato infected with blight. Tomato plant infected with blight. Unripe tomatoes infected with blight. Potatoes infected with late blight are shrunken on the outside, corky and rotted inside. 293x293pxThe asexual life cycle of Phytophthora infestans is characterized by alternating phases of hyphal growth, sporulation, sporangia germination (either through zoospore release or direct germination, i.e. germ tube emergence from the sporangium), and the re-establishment of hyphal growth. There is also a sexual cycle, which occurs when isolates of opposite mating type (A1 and A2) meet. Hormonal communication triggers the formation of the sexual spores, called oospores.Judelson HS, Blanco FA (2005) The spores of Phytophthora: weapons of the plant destroyer. Nature Microbiology Reviews 3: 47‚Äì58. The different types of spores play major roles in the dissemination and survival of P. infestans. Sporangia are spread by wind or water and enable the movement of P. infestans between different host plants. The zoospores released from sporangia are biflagellated and chemotactic, allowing further movement of P. infestans on water films found on leaves or soils. Both sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, in contrast to oospores which can persist in a viable form for many years. The color of potato sign is white. People can observe Phytophthora infestans produce sporangia and sporangiophores on the surface of potato stems and leaves. These sporangia and sporangiophores always appear on the lower surface of the foliage. As for tuber blight, the white mycelium often shows on the tubers' surface. Under ideal conditions, the life cycle can be completed on potato or tomato foliage in about five days. Sporangia develop on the leaves, spreading through the crop when temperatures are above and humidity is over 75‚Äì80% for 2 days or more. Rain can wash spores into the soil where they infect young tubers, and the spores can also travel long distances on the wind. The early stages of blight are easily missed. Symptoms include the appearance of dark blotches on leaf tips and plant stems. White mold will appear under the leaves in humid conditions and the whole plant may quickly collapse. Infected tubers develop grey or dark patches that are reddish brown beneath the skin, and quickly decay to a foul-smelling mush caused by the infestation of secondary soft bacterial rots. Seemingly healthy tubers may rot later when in store. P. infestans survives poorly in nature apart from its plant hosts. Under most conditions, the hyphae and asexual sporangia can survive for only brief periods in plant debris or soil, and are generally killed off during frosts or very warm weather. The exceptions involve oospores, and hyphae present within tubers. The persistence of viable pathogen within tubers, such as those that are left in the ground after the previous year's harvest or left in cull piles is a major problem in disease management. In particular, volunteer plants sprouting from infected tubers are thought to be a major source of inoculum at the start of a growing season. This can have devastating effects by destroying entire crops. Genetics P. infestans is diploid, with about 11‚Äì13 chromosomes, and in 2009 scientists completed the sequencing of its genome. The genome was found to be considerably larger (240 Mbp) than that of most other Phytophthora species whose genomes have been sequenced; Phytophthora sojae has a 95 Mbp genome and Phytophthora ramorum had a 65 Mbp genome. About 18,000 genes were detected within the P. infestans genome. It also contained a diverse variety of transposons and many gene families encoding for effector proteins that are involved in causing pathogenicity. These proteins are split into two main groups depending on whether they are produced by the water mould in the symplast (inside plant cells) or in the apoplast (between plant cells). Proteins produced in the symplast included RXLR proteins, which contain an arginine-X-leucine-arginine (where X can be any amino acid) sequence at the amino terminus of the protein. Some RXLR proteins are avirulence proteins, meaning that they can be detected by the plant and lead to a hypersensitive response which restricts the growth of the pathogen. P. infestans was found to encode around 60% more of these proteins than most other Phytophthora species. Those found in the apoplast include hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases, lipases and glycosylases that act to degrade plant tissue, enzyme inhibitors to protect against host defence enzymes and necrotizing toxins. Overall the genome was found to have an extremely high repeat content (around 74%) and to have an unusual gene distribution in that some areas contain many genes whereas others contain very few. Origin and diversity of P. infestans Histological model of Phytophthora infestans, Botanical Museum Greifswald Histological model of a potato leaf with Phytophthora infestans, Botanical Museum Greifswald The highlands of central Mexico are considered by many to be the center of origin of P. infestans, although others have proposed its origin to be in the Andes, which is also the origin of potatoes. A recent study evaluated these two alternate hypotheses and found conclusive support for central Mexico being the center of origin. Support for Mexico comes from multiple observations including the fact that populations are genetically most diverse in Mexico, late blight is observed in native tuber-bearing Solanum species, populations of the pathogen are in Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium, the two mating types occur in a 1:1 ratio, and detailed phylogeographic and evolutionary studies. Furthermore, the closest relatives of P. infestans, namely P. mirabilis and P. ipomoeae are endemic to central Mexico. On the other hand, the only close relative found in South America, namely P. andina, is a hybrid that does not share a single common ancestor with P. infestans. Finally, populations of P. infestans in South America lack genetic diversity and are clonal. Migrations from Mexico to North America or Europe have occurred several times throughout history, probably linked to the movement of tubers. Until the 1970s, the A2 mating type was restricted to Mexico, but now in many regions of the world both A1 and A2 isolates can be found in the same region. The co-occurrence of the two mating types is significant due to the possibility of sexual recombination and formation of oospores, which can survive the winter. Only in Mexico and Scandinavia, however, is oospore formation thought to play a role in overwintering.Lehtinen A, Hannukkala A. (2004) Oospores of Phytophthora infestans in soil provide an important new source of primary inoculum in Finland. Agricultural and Food Science 13:399‚Äì410. In other parts of Europe, increasing genetic diversity has been observed as a consequence of sexual reproduction This is notable since different forms of P. infestans vary in their aggressiveness on potato or tomato, in sporulation rate, and sensitivity to fungicides. Variation in such traits also occurs in North America, however importation of new genotypes from Mexico appears to be the predominant cause of genetic diversity, as opposed to sexual recombination within potato or tomato fields. Many of the strains that appeared outside of Mexico since the 1980s have been more aggressive, leading to increased crop losses. Some of the differences between strains may be related to variation in the RXLR effectors that are present. Disease management P. infestans is still a difficult disease to control. There are many chemical options in agriculture for the control of both damage to the foliage and infections of the tuber. A few of the most common foliar-applied fungicides are Ridomil, a Gavel/SuperTin tank mix, and Previcur Flex. All of the aforementioned fungicides need to be tank mixed with a broad-spectrum fungicide such as mancozeb or chlorothalonil not just for resistance management but also because the potato plants will be attacked by other pathogens at the same time. If adequate field scouting occurs and late blight is found soon after disease development, localized patches of potato plants can be killed with a desiccant (e.g. paraquat) through the use of a backpack sprayer. This management technique can be thought of as a field-scale hypersensitive response similar to what occurs in some plant-viral interactions whereby cells surrounding the initial point of infection are killed in order to prevent proliferation of the pathogen. If infected tubers make it into the storage bin, there's a very high risk to the storage life of that bin. Once in storage, there isn't much that can be done besides emptying the parts of the bin that contain tubers infected with Phytophthora infestans. To increase the probability of successfully storing potatoes from a field where late blight was known to occur during the growing season, some products can be applied just prior to entering storage (e.g. Phostrol).https://www.uidaho.edu/-/media/UIdaho- Responsive/Files/cals/programs/potatoes/Storage/storage-mangement-options-for- disease-control-05.pdf?la=en&hash;=4D7C3002141D9F3C6040C66B5286E75A2DC8203C Around the world the disease causes around $6 billion of damage to crops each year. =Resistant plants= Potatoes after exposure to Phytophthora infestans. The normal potatoes have blight but the cisgenic potatoes are healthy. Genetically modified King Edward potato (right) next to King Edward which has not been genetically modified (left). Research field belonging to the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in 2019. Breeding for resistance, particularly in potato, has had limited success in part due to difficulties in crossing cultivated potato to its wild relatives, which are the source of potential resistance genes. In addition, most resistance genes only work against a subset of P. infestans isolates, since effective plant disease resistance only results when the pathogen expresses a RXLR effector gene that matches the corresponding plant resistance (R) gene; effector-R gene interactions trigger a range of plant defenses, such as the production of compounds toxic to the pathogen. Potato and tomato varieties vary in their susceptibility to blight. Most early varieties are very vulnerable; they should be planted early so that the crop matures before blight starts (usually in July in the Northern Hemisphere). Many old crop varieties, such as King Edward potato are also very susceptible but are grown because they are wanted commercially. Maincrop varieties which are very slow to develop blight include Cara, Stirling, Teena, Torridon, Remarka, and Romano. Some so-called resistant varieties can resist some strains of blight and not others, so their performance may vary depending on which are around. These crops have had polygenic resistance bred into them, and are known as \\"field resistant\\". New varieties such as Sarpo Mira and Sarpo Axona show great resistance to blight even in areas of heavy infestation. Defender is an American cultivar whose parentage includes Ranger Russet and Polish potatoes resistant to late blight. It is a long white-skinned cultivar with both foliar and tuber resistance to late blight. Defender was released in 2004. Genetic engineering may also provide options for generating resistance cultivars. A resistance gene effective against most known strains of blight has been identified from a wild relative of the potato, Solanum bulbocastanum, and introduced by genetic engineering into cultivated varieties of potato. This is an example of cisgenic genetic engineering. Free version =Reducing inoculum= Blight can be controlled by limiting the source of inoculum. Only good-quality seed potatoes and tomatoes obtained from certified suppliers should be planted. Often discarded potatoes from the previous season and self-sown tubers can act as sources of inoculum. Compost, soil or potting medium can be heat-treated to kill oomycetes such as Phytophthora infestans. The recommended sterilisation temperature for oomycetes is for 30 minutes. =Environmental conditions= There are several environmental conditions that are conducive to P. infestans. An example of such took place in the United States during the 2009 growing season. As colder than average for the season and with greater than average rainfall, there was a major infestation of tomato plants, specifically in the eastern states. By using weather forecasting systems, such as BLITECAST, if the following conditions occur as the canopy of the crop closes, then the use of fungicides is recommended to prevent an epidemic. * A Beaumont Period is a period of 48 consecutive hours, in at least 46 of which the hourly readings of temperature and relative humidity at a given place have not been less than and 75%, respectively. * A Smith Period is at least two consecutive days where min temperature is or above and on each day at least 11 hours when the relative humidity is greater than 90%. The Beaumont and Smith periods have traditionally been used by growers in the United Kingdom, with different criteria developed by growers in other regions. The Smith period has been the preferred system used in the UK since its introduction in the 1970s. Based on these conditions and other factors, several tools have been developed to help growers manage the disease and plan fungicide applications. Often these are deployed as part of Decision support systems accessible through web sites or smart phones. Several studies have attempted to develop systems for real-time detection via flow cytometry or microscopy of airborne sporangia collected in air samplers. Whilst these methods show potential to allow detection of sporangia in advance of occurrence of detectable disease symptoms on plants, and would thus be useful in enhancing existing Decision support systems, none have been commercially deployed to date. =Use of fungicides= Spraying in a potato field for prevention of potato blight in Nottinghamshire, England. Fungicides for the control of potato blight are normally only used in a preventative manner, optionally in conjunction with disease forecasting. In susceptible varieties, sometimes fungicide applications may be needed weekly. An early spray is most effective. The choice of fungicide can depend on the nature of local strains of P. infestans. Metalaxyl is a fungicide that was marketed for use against P. infestans, but suffered serious resistance issues when used on its own. In some regions of the world during the 1980s and 1990s, most strains of P. infestans became resistant to metalaxyl, but in subsequent years many populations shifted back to sensitivity. To reduce the occurrence of resistance, it is strongly advised to use single-target fungicides such as metalaxyl along with carbamate compounds. A combination of other compounds are recommended for managing metalaxyl-resistant strains. These include mandipropamid, chlorothalonil, fluazinam, triphenyltin, mancozeb, and others. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against late blight. In the past, copper(II) sulfate solution (called 'bluestone') was used to combat potato blight. Copper pesticides remain in use on organic crops, both in the form of copper hydroxide and copper sulfate. Given the dangers of copper toxicity, other organic control options that have been shown to be effective include horticultural oils, phosphorous acids, and rhamnolipid biosurfactants, while sprays containing \\"beneficial\\" microbes such as Bacillus subtilis or compounds that encourage the plant to produce defensive chemicals (such as knotweed extract) have not performed as well.Gevens, Amanda, University of Wisconsin Madison Extension. Managing Late Blight in Organic Tomato & Potato Crops. =Control of tuber blight= Ridging is often used to reduce tuber contamination by blight. This normally involves piling soil or mulch around the stems of the potato blight meaning the pathogen has farther to travel to get to the tuber. Another approach is to destroy the canopy around five weeks before harvest, using a contact herbicide or sulfuric acid to burn off the foliage. Eliminating infected foliage reduces the likelihood of tuber infection. Historical impact Suggested paths of migration and diversification of P. infestans lineages HERB-1 and US-1 The effect of Phytophthora infestans in Ireland in 1845‚Äì52 was one of the factors which caused over one million to starve to death and forced another two million to emigrate from affected countries. Most commonly referenced is the Great Irish Famine, during the late 1840s. The first recorded instances of the disease were in the United States, in Philadelphia and New York City in early 1843. Winds then spread the spores, and in 1845 it was found from Illinois to Nova Scotia, and from Virginia to Ontario. It crossed the Atlantic Ocean with a shipment of seed potatoes for Belgian farmers in 1845. All of the potato- growing countries in Europe were affected, but the potato blight hit Ireland the hardest. Implicated in Ireland's fate was the island's disproportionate dependency on a single variety of potato, the Irish Lumper. The lack of genetic variability created a susceptible host population for the organism. After the blight strains originating in Chilo√© Archipelago replaced earlier potatoes of Peruvian origin in Europe. During the First World War, all of the copper in Germany was used for shell casings and electric wire and therefore none was available for making copper sulfate to spray potatoes. A major late blight outbreak on potato in Germany therefore went untreated, and the resulting scarcity of potatoes led to the deaths of 700,000 German civilians from starvation.Carefoot, G.L. and E.R. Sprott. 1967. Famine on the Wind: Man's Battle Against Plant Disease. Rand McNally. Since 1941, Eastern Africa has been suffering potato production losses because of strains of P. infestans from Europe. France, Canada, the United States, and the Soviet Union researched P. infestans as a biological weapon in the 1940s and 1950s. Potato blight was one of more than 17 agents that the United States researched as potential biological weapons before the nation suspended its biological weapons program.\\"Chemical and Biological Weapons: Possession and Programs Past and Present\\", James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, Middlebury College, April 9, 2002, accessed November 14, 2008. Whether a weapon based on the pathogen would be effective is questionable, due to the difficulties in delivering viable pathogen to an enemy's fields, and the role of uncontrollable environmental factors in spreading the disease. Late blight (A2 type) has not yet been detected in Australia and strict biosecurity measures are in place. The disease has been seen in China, India and south-east Asian countries.

As a system of thought, laissez-faire rests on the axioms that the individual is the basic unit in society and has a natural right to freedom; that the physical order of nature is a harmonious and self- regulating system; and that corporations are creatures of the state and therefore the citizens must watch them closely due to their propensity to disrupt the Smithian spontaneous order.Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations, p. 52: \\"The exclusive privileges of corporations, statutes of apprenticeship, and all those laws which restrain, in particular employments, the competition to a smaller number than might otherwise go into them, have the same tendency, though in a less degree. They are a sort of enlarged monopolies, and may frequently, for ages together, and in whole classes of employments, keep up the market price of particular commodities above the natural price, and maintain both the wages of the labour and the profits of the stock employed about them somewhat above their natural rate.\\" These axioms constitute the basic elements of laissez-faire thought. Another basic principle holds that markets should be competitive, a rule that the early advocates of laissez- faire always emphasized. With the aims of maximizing freedom and of allowing markets to self-regulate, early advocates of laissez-faire proposed a imp√¥t unique, a tax on land rent (similar to Georgism) to replace all taxes that they saw as damaging welfare by penalizing production. Proponents of laissez- faire argue for a complete separation of government from the economic sector.Quick Reference Handbook Set, Basic Knowledge and Modern Technology (revised) by Edward H. Litchfield, Ph.D The phrase laissez-faire is part of a larger French phrase and literally translates to \\"let [it/them] do\\", but in this context the phrase usually means to \\"let it be\\".\\"Laissez-faire\\", Business Dictionary. Laissez-faire capitalism started being practiced in the mid-18th century and was further popularized by Adam Smith's book The Wealth of Nations.Edward H. Litchfield. \\"Quick Reference Handbook Set, Basic Knowledge and Modern Technology\\" (revised ed.). It has been most prominent in Britain and the United States in the 19th century. While associated with capitalism in common usage, there are also non-capitalist forms of laissez-faire, including some forms of market socialism.  Etymology and usage  The term laissez- faire likely originated in a meeting that took place around 1681 between powerful French Controller-General of Finances Jean-Baptiste Colbert and a group of French businessmen headed by M. Le Gendre. When the eager mercantilist minister asked how the French state could be of service to the merchants and help promote their commerce, Le Gendre replied simply: \\"Laissez- nous faire\\" (\\"Leave it to us\\" or \\"Let us do [it]\\", the French verb not requiring an object).\\"Journal Oeconomique\\". 1751 article by the French minister of finance. The anecdote on the Colbert‚ÄìLe Gendre meeting appeared in a 1751 article in the Journal √©conomique, written by French minister and champion of free trade Ren√© de Voyer, Marquis d'Argenson‚Äîalso the first known appearance of the term in print.M. d'Argenson, \\"Lettre au sujet de la dissertation sur le commerce du marquis de Belloni', Avril 1751, Journal Oeconomique p. 111. See A. Oncken, Die Maxime Laissez faire et laissez passer, ihr Ursprung, ihr Werden, 1866 Argenson himself had used the phrase earlier (1736) in his own diaries in a famous outburst: Vincent de Gournay, a French Physiocrat and intendant of commerce in the 1750s, popularized the term laissez-faire as he allegedly adopted it from Fran√ßois Quesnay's writings on China. Quesnay coined the phrases laissez-faire and laissez-passer, laissez- faire being a translation of the Chinese term wu wei (ÁÑ°ÁÇ∫). Gournay ardently supported the removal of restrictions on trade and the deregulation of industry in France. Delighted with the Colbert‚ÄìLe Gendre anecdote,According to J. Turgot's \\"Eloge de Vincent de Gournay,\\" Mercure, August, 1759 (repr. in Oeuvres of Turgot, vol. 1 p. 288. he forged it into a larger maxim all his own: \\"Laissez faire et laissez passer\\" (\\"Let do and let pass\\"). His motto has also been identified as the longer \\"Laissez faire et laissez passer, le monde va de lui m√™me !\\" (\\"Let do and let pass, the world goes on by itself!\\"). Although Gournay left no written tracts on his economic policy ideas, he had immense personal influence on his contemporaries, notably his fellow Physiocrats, who credit both the laissez-faire slogan and the doctrine to Gournay.Gournay was credited with the phrase by Jacques Turgot (\\"Eloge a Gournay\\", Mercure 1759), the Marquis de Mirabeau (Philosophie rurale 1763 and Eph√©m√©rides du Citoyen, 1767.), the Comte d'Albon (\\"√âloge Historique de M. Quesnay\\", Nouvelles Eph√©m√©rides √âconomiques, May, 1775, pp. 136‚Äì137) and DuPont de Nemours (Introduction to Oeuvres de Jacques Turgot, 1808‚Äì11, Vol. I, pp. 257, 259, Daire ed.) among others. Before d'Argenson or Gournay, P. S. de Boisguilbert had enunciated the phrase \\"On laisse faire la nature\\" (\\"Let nature run its course\\").\\"Tant, encore une fois, qu'on laisse faire la nature, on ne doit rien craindre de pareil\\", P.S. de Boisguilbert, 1707, Dissertation de la nature des richesses, de l'argent et des tributs. D'Argenson himself during his life was better known for the similar, but less-celebrated motto \\"Pas trop gouverner\\" (\\"Govern not too much\\").DuPont de Nemours, op cit, p. 258. Oncken (op.cit) and Keynes (op.cit.) also credit the Marquis d'Argenson with the phrase \\"Pour gouverner mieux, il faudrait gouverner moins\\" (\\"To govern best, one needs to govern less\\"), possibly the source of the famous \\"That government is best which governs least\\" motto popular in American circles, attributed variously to Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson and Henry Thoreau. However, Gournay's use of the laissez-faire phrase as popularized by the Physiocrats gave it its cachet. The Physiocrats proclaimed laissez-faire in 18th-century France, placing it at the very core of their economic principles and famous economists, beginning with Adam Smith, developed the idea.Fine, Sidney. Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State. United States: The University of Michigan Press, 1964. Print It is with the Physiocrats and the classical political economy that the term laissez-faire is ordinarily associated.Macgregor, Economic Thought and Policy (London, 1949), pp. 54‚Äì67 The book Laissez Faire and the General-Welfare State states: \\"The physiocrats, reacting against the excessive mercantilist regulations of the France of their day, expressed a belief in a 'natural order' or liberty under which individuals in following their selfish interests contributed to the general good. Since, in their view, this natural order functioned successfully without the aid of government, they advised the state to restrict itself to upholding the rights of private property and individual liberty, to removing all artificial barriers to trade, and to abolishing all useless laws\\". The French phrase laissez-faire gained currency in English-speaking countries with the spread of Physiocratic literature in the late 18th century. George Whatley's 1774 Principles of Trade (co-authored with Benjamin Franklin) re-told the Colbert-LeGendre anecdote‚Äîthis may mark the first appearance of the phrase in an English-language publication.Whatley's Principles of Trade are reprinted in Works of Benjamin Franklin, Vol.2, p. 401. Herbert Spencer was opposed to a slightly different application of laissez faire‚Äîto \\"that miserable laissez- faire\\" that leads to men's ruin, saying: \\"Along with that miserable laissez- faire which calmly looks on while men ruin themselves in trying to enforce by law their equitable claims, there goes activity in supplying them, at other men's cost, with gratis novel-reading!\\"Justice Part IV of Ethics (1892). p. 44. In Spencer's case, the right of private ownership was being assailed and it was that miserable spirit of laissez-faire in halls of legislation that exhausted men in the effort of protecting their right. As a product of the Enlightenment, laissez-faire was \\"conceived as the way to unleash human potential through the restoration of a natural system, a system unhindered by the restrictions of government\\".Gaspard, Toufick. A Political Economy of Lebanon 1948‚Äì2002: The Limits of Laissez-faire. Boston: Brill, 2004. In a similar vein, Adam Smith viewed the economy as a natural system and the market as an organic part of that system. Smith saw laissez-faire as a moral program and the market its instrument to ensure men the rights of natural law. By extension, free markets become a reflection of the natural system of liberty. For Smith, laissez-faire was \\"a program for the abolition of laws constraining the market, a program for the restoration of order and for the activation of potential growth\\". However, Smith and notable classical economists such as Thomas Malthus and David Ricardo did not use the phrase. Jeremy Bentham used the term, but it was probably James Mill's reference to the laissez-faire maxim (together with the \\"Pas trop gouverner\\" motto) in an 1824 entry for the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica that really brought the term into wider English usage. With the advent of the Anti-Corn Law League (founded 1838), the term received much of its English meaning. Smith first used the metaphor of an invisible hand in his book The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) to describe the unintentional effects of economic self-organization from economic self- interest.Andres Marroquin, Invisible Hand: The Wealth of Adam Smith, The Minerva Group, Inc., 2002, , p. 123. Although not the metaphor itself, the idea lying behind the invisible hand belongs to Bernard de Mandeville and his Fable of the Bees (1705). In political economy, that idea and the doctrine of laissez-faire have long been closely related.John Eatwell, The Invisible Hand, W. W. Norton & Company, 1989, pp. Preface x1. Some have characterized the invisible-hand metaphor as one for laissez-faire, although Smith never actually used the term himself.Roy C. Smith, Adam Smith and the Origins of American Enterprise: How the Founding Fathers Turned to a Great Economist's Writings and Created the American Economy, Macmillan, 2004, , pp. 13‚Äì14. In Third Millennium Capitalism (2000), Wyatt M. Rogers Jr. notes a trend whereby recently \\"conservative politicians and economists have chosen the term 'free- market capitalism' in lieu of laissez-faire\\". American individualist anarchists such as Benjamin Tucker saw themselves as economic laissez-faire socialists and political individualists while arguing that their \\"anarchistic socialism\\" or \\"individual anarchism\\" was \\"consistent Manchesterism\\".Tucker, Benjamin (1926). Individual Liberty: Selections from the Writings of Benjamin R. Tucker. New York: Vanguard Press. pp. 1‚Äì19.  History = Europe = In Europe, the laissez-faire movement was first widely promoted by the Physiocrats, a movement that included Vincent de Gournay (1712‚Äì1759), a successful merchant turned political figure. Gournay is postulated to have adapted the Taoist concept wu wei,Christian Gerlach, Wu-Wei in Europe. A Study of Eurasian Economic Thought, London School of Economics ‚Äì March 2005 p. 3\\" the diffusion of wu-wei, co-evolved with the inner-European laissez-faire principle, the Libaniusian model.\\" p. 8 \\"Thus, wu-wei has to be recognized as a laissez-faire instrument of Chinese political economy \\"p. 10 \\"Practising wu- wei erzhi. Consequently, it is this variant of the laissez-faire maxim in which the basis of Physiocracy's 'moral philosophy' is to be located. Priddat's work made clear that the wu-wei of the complete √©conomie has to be considered central to Physiocracy; \\"p. 11 \\"that wu-wei translates into French as laissez-faire\\". from the writings on China by Fran√ßois Quesnay (1694‚Äì1774). Gournay held that government should allow the laws of nature to govern economic activity, with the state only intervening to protect life, liberty and property. Fran√ßois Quesnay and Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de l'Aulne took up Gournay's ideas. Quesnay had the ear of the King of France, Louis XV and in 1754 persuaded him to give laissez-faire a try. On September 17, the King abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale and transport of grain. For more than a decade, the experiment appeared successful, but 1768 saw a poor harvest, and the cost of bread rose so high that there was widespread starvation while merchants exported grain in order to obtain the best profit. In 1770, the Comptroller-General of Finances Joseph Marie Terray revoked the edict allowing free trade in grain.Will & Ariel Durant, Rousseau and the Revolution, pp. 71‚Äì77, Simon and Schuster, 1967, . The doctrine of laissez-faire became an integral part of 19th-century European liberalism. Just as liberals supported freedom of thought in the intellectual sphere, so were they equally prepared to champion the principles of free trade and free competition in the sphere of economics, seeing the state as merely a passive policeman, protecting private property and administering justice, but not interfering with the affairs of its citizens. Businessmen, British industrialists in particular, were quick to associate these principles with their own economic interests. Many of the ideas of the physiocrats spread throughout Europe and were adopted to a greater or lesser extent in Sweden, Tuscany, Spain and in the newly created United States. Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations (1776), met Quesnay and acknowledged his influence.Will & Ariel Durant, Rousseau and the Revolution, p. 76, Simon and Schuster, 1967, . In Britain, the newspaper The Economist (founded in 1843) became an influential voice for laissez-faire capitalism. Laissez-faire advocates opposed food aid for famines occurring within the British Empire. In 1847, referring to the famine then underway in Ireland, founder of The Economist James Wilson wrote: \\"It is no man's business to provide for another\\". However, The Economist campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. The Great Famine in Ireland in 1845 led to the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. The tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high were repealed.George Miller. On Fairness and Efficiency. The Policy Press, 2000. p. 344 However, repeal of the Corn Laws came too late to stop the Irish famine, partly because it was done in stages over three years.Christine Kinealy. A Death-Dealing Famine:The Great Hunger in Ireland. Pluto Press, 1997. . p. 59. A group that became known as the Manchester Liberals, to which Richard Cobden (1804‚Äì1865) and John Bright (1811‚Äì1889) belonged, were staunch defenders of free trade. After the death of Cobden, the Cobden Club (founded in 1866) continued their work. In 1860, Britain and France concluded a trade treaty, after which other European countries signed several similar treaties. The breakdown of laissez-faire as practised by the British Empire was partly led by British companies eager for state support of their positions abroad, in particular British oil companies. = United States = Frank Bourgin's study of the Constitutional Convention and subsequent decades argues that direct government involvement in the economy was intended by the Founding Fathers. The reason for this was the economic and financial chaos the nation suffered under the Articles of Confederation. The goal was to ensure that dearly-won political independence was not lost by being economically and financially dependent on the powers and princes of Europe. The creation of a strong central government able to promote science, invention, industry and commerce was seen as an essential means of promoting the general welfare and making the economy of the United States strong enough for them to determine their own destiny. One later result of this intent was the adoption of Richard Farrington's new plan (worked out with his co-worker John Jefferson) to incorporate new changes during the New Deal. Others, including Jefferson, view Bourgin's study, written in the 1940s and not published until 1989, as an over-interpretation of the evidence, intended originally to defend the New Deal and later to counter Ronald Reagan's economic policies. Historian Kathleen G. Donohue argues that in the 19th century liberalism in the United States had distinctive characteristics and that \\"at the center of classical liberal theory [in Europe] was the idea of laissez-faire. To the vast majority of American classical liberals, however, laissez-faire did not mean \\"no government intervention\\" at all. On the contrary, they were more than willing to see government provide tariffs, railroad subsidies, and internal improvements, all of which benefited producers\\". Notable examples of government intervention in the period prior to the American Civil War include the establishment of the Patent Office in 1802; the establishment of the Office of Standard Weights and Measures in 1830; the creation of the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1807 and other measures to improve river and harbor navigation; the various Army expeditions to the west, beginning with Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery in 1804 and continuing into the 1870s, almost always under the direction of an officer from the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and which provided crucial information for the overland pioneers that followed; the assignment of Army Engineer officers to assist or direct the surveying and construction of the early railroads and canals; and the establishment of the First Bank of the United States and Second Bank of the United States as well as various protectionist measures (e.g. the tariff of 1828). Several of these proposals met with serious opposition and required a great deal of horse-trading to be enacted into law. For instance, the First National Bank would not have reached the desk of President George Washington in the absence of an agreement that was reached between Alexander Hamilton and several Southern members of Congress to locate the capitol in the District of Columbia. In contrast to Hamilton and the Federalists was Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's opposing political party, the Democratic-Republicans. Most of the early opponents of laissez-faire capitalism in the United States subscribed to the American School. This school of thought was inspired by the ideas of Hamilton, who proposed the creation of a government-sponsored bank and increased tariffs to favor Northern industrial interests. Following Hamilton's death, the more abiding protectionist influence in the antebellum period came from Henry Clay and his American System. In the early 19th century, \\"it is quite clear that the laissez-faire label is an inappropriate one\\" to apply to the relationship between the United States government and industry. In the mid-19th century, the United States followed the Whig tradition of economic nationalism, which included increased state control, regulation and macroeconomic development of infrastructure. Public works such as the provision and regulation transportation such as railroads took effect. The Pacific Railway Acts provided the development of the First Transcontinental Railroad. In order to help pay for its war effort in the Civil War, the United States government imposed its first personal income tax on 5 August 1861 as part of the Revenue Act of 1861 (3% of all incomes over US$800; rescinded in 1872). Following the Civil War, the movement towards a mixed economy accelerated. Protectionism increased with the McKinley Tariff of 1890 and the Dingley Tariff of 1897. Government regulation of the economy expanded with the enactment of the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 and the Sherman Anti-trust Act. The Progressive Era saw the enactment of more controls on the economy as evidenced by the Woodrow Wilson administration's New Freedom program. Following World War I and the Great Depression, the United States turned to a mixed economy which combined free enterprise with a progressive income tax and in which from time to time the government stepped in to support and protect American industry from competition from overseas. For example, in the 1980s the government sought to protect the automobile industry by \\"voluntary\\" export restrictions from Japan. In 1986, Pietro S. Nivola wrote: \\"By and large, the comparative strength of the dollar against major foreign currencies has reflected high U.S. interest rates driven by huge federal budget deficits. Hence, the source of much of the current deterioration of trade is not the general state of the economy, but rather the government's mix of fiscal and monetary policies ‚Äì that is, the problematic juxtaposition of bold tax reductions, relatively tight monetary targets, generous military outlays, and only modest cuts in major entitlement programs. Put simply, the roots of the trade problem and of the resurgent protectionism it has fomented are fundamentally political as well as economic\\". A more recent advocate of total laissez-faire has been Objectivist Ayn Rand, who described it as \\"the abolition of any and all forms of government intervention in production and trade, the separation of State and Economics, in the same way and for the same reasons as the separation of Church and State\\".Rand, Ayn Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal, Ch. 7, New American Library, Signet, 1967. This viewpoint is summed up in what is known as the iron law of regulation, which states that all government economic regulation eventually leads to a net loss in social welfare. Rand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights). and she considered laissez-faire capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights.; . She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, socialism and dictatorship.. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government.. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term \\"radical for capitalism\\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics.; ; ; . She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism.; . She rejected anarchism as a na√Øve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.; ; .  Models = Capitalism = A closely related conception is that of raw or pure capitalism, or unrestrained capitalism, that refers to capitalism free of social regulations, with low, minimal or no government and operating almost entirely on the profit motive. Other than laissez-faire economics and anarcho-capitalism, it is not associated with a school of thought and typically has a bad connotation which hints towards a perceived need for restraint due to social needs and securities that can not be adequately responded to by companies with just a motive for making profit. Robert Kuttner states that \\"for over a century, popular struggles in democracies have used the nation-state to temper raw capitalism. The power of voters has offset the power of capital. But as national barriers have come down in the name of freer commerce, so has the capacity of governments to manage capitalism in a broad public interest. So the real issue is not 'trade' but democratic governance\\". The main issues of raw capitalism are said to lie in its disregard for quality, durability, sustainability, respect for the environment and human beings as well as a lack of morality. From this more critical angle, companies might naturally aim to maximise profits at the expense of workers' and broader social interests. Raw or hyper-capitalism is a prime motive of cyberpunk in dystopian works such as Syndicate. = Socialism = Although laissez-faire has been commonly associated with capitalism, there is a similar laissez-faire economic theory and system associated with socialism called left-wing laissez-faire,Nick Manley. \\"Brief Introduction To Left-Wing Laissez Faire Economic Theory: Part One\\".Nick Maley. \\"Brief Introduction To Left-Wing Laissez Faire Economic Theory: Part Two\\". or free-market anarchism, also known as free-market anti- capitalism and free-market socialism to distinguish it from laissez-faire capitalism.Chartier, Gary; Johnson, Charles W.

Kevin Carson describes his politics as on \\"the outer fringes of both free market libertarianism and socialism\\"\\"Introductions ‚Äì Kevin Carson\\". and has also been highly critical of intellectual property. Carson has identified the work of Benjamin Tucker, Thomas Hodgskin, Ralph Borsodi, Paul Goodman, Lewis Mumford, Elinor Ostrom, Peter Kropotkin and Ivan Illich as sources of inspiration for his approach to politics and economics.Kevin A. Carson, Introduction, The Art of the Possible. In addition to individualist anarchist Benjamin Tucker's big four monopolies (land, money, tariffs and patents), he argues that the state has also transferred wealth to the wealthy by subsidizing organizational centralization in the form of transportation and communication subsidies. Carson believes that Tucker overlooked this issue due to Tucker's focus on individual market transactions whereas he also focuses on organizational issues. As such, the primary focus of his most recent work has been decentralized manufacturing and the informal and household economies. The theoretical sections of Carson's Studies in Mutualist Political Economy are also presented as an attempt to integrate marginalist critiques into the labor theory of value.Kevin Carson, \\"Studies in Mutualist Political Economy\\", chs. 1‚Äì3. In response to claims that he uses the term capitalism incorrectly, Carson says he is deliberately choosing to resurrect what he claims to be an old definition of the term in order to \\"make a point\\". He claims that \\"the term 'capitalism,' as it was originally used, did not refer to a free market, but to a type of statist class system in which capitalists controlled the state and the state intervened in the market on their behalf\\".Carson, Kevin A. Carson's Rejoinders. Journal of Libertarian Studies, Volume 20, No. 1 (Winter 2006): 97‚Äì136, pp. 116, 117. Carson holds that \\"capitalism, arising as a new class society directly from the old class society of the Middle Ages, was founded on an act of robbery as massive as the earlier feudal conquest of the land. It has been sustained to the present by continual state intervention to protect its system of privilege without which its survival is unimaginable\\".Richman, Sheldon, Libertarian Left , The American Conservative (March 2011). Carson argues that in a truly laissez-faire system the ability to extract a profit from labor and capital would be negligible. Carson coined the pejorative term vulgar libertarianism, a phrase that describes the use of a free market rhetoric in defense of corporate capitalism and economic inequality. According to Carson, the term is derived from the phrase vulgar political economy which Karl Marx described as an economic order that \\"deliberately becomes increasingly apologetic and makes strenuous attempts to talk out of existence the ideas which contain the contradictions [existing in economic life]\\".Marx, Theories of Surplus Value, III, p. 501. Gary Chartier offers an understanding of property rights as contingent yet tightly constrained social strategies, reflective of the importance of multiple, overlapping rationales for separate ownership and of natural law principles of practical reasonableness, defending robust yet non-absolute protections for these rights in a manner similar to that employed by David Hume.See Gary Chartier, Anarchy and Legal Order: Law and Politics for a Stateless Society (New York: Cambridge UP 2013) 44‚Äì156. This account is distinguished both from Lockean and neo-Lockean views which deduce property rights from the idea of self-ownership and from consequentialist accounts that might license widespread ad hoc interference with the possessions of groups and individuals.See Gary Chartier, \\"Natural Law and Non-Aggression,\\" Acta Juridica Hungarica 51.2 (June 2010): 79‚Äì96 and, for an earlier version, Justice 32‚Äì46. Chartier uses this account to ground a clear statement of the natural law basis for the view that solidaristic wealth redistribution by individual persons is often morally required, but as a response by individuals and grass- roots networks to particular circumstances rather than as a state-driven attempt to achieve a particular distributive pattern.See Justice 47‚Äì68. He advances detailed arguments for workplace democracy rooted in such natural law principles as subsidiarity,Justice 89‚Äì120. defending it as morally desirable and as a likely outcome of the elimination of injustice rather than as something to be mandated by the state.See Gary Chartier, \\"Pirate Constitutions and Workplace Democracy,\\" Jahrbuch f√ºr Recht und Ethik 18 (2010): 449‚Äì67.

He has argued that proponents of genuinely freed markets should explicitly reject capitalism and identify with the global anti-capitalist movement while emphasizing that the abuses the anti-capitalist movement highlights result from state-tolerated violence and state-secured privilege rather than from voluntary cooperation and exchange. According to Chartier, \\"it makes sense for [freed-market advocates] to name what they oppose 'capitalism.' Doing so calls attention to the freedom movement's radical roots, emphasizes the value of understanding society as an alternative to the state, underscores the fact that proponents of freedom object to non-aggressive as well as aggressive restraints on liberty, ensures that advocates of freedom aren't confused with people who use market rhetoric to prop up an unjust status quo, and expresses solidarity between defenders of freed markets and workers ‚Äî as well as ordinary people around the world who use \\"capitalism\\" as a short-hand label for the world-system that constrains their freedom and stunts their lives\\".\\"Advocates of Freed Markets Should Embrace \\"Anti-Capitalism\\".  Criticism  Over the years, a number of economists have offered critiques of laissez-faire economics. Adam Smith acknowledges some moral ambiguities towards the system of capitalism.Spencer J. Pack. Capitalism as a Moral System: Adam Smith's Critique of the Free Market Economy. Great Britain: Edward Elgar, 2010. Print Smith had misgivings concerning some aspects of each of the major character-types produced by modern capitalist society, namely the landlords, the workers and the capitalists. Smith claimed that \\"[t]he landlords' role in the economic process is passive. Their ability to reap a revenue solely from ownership of land tends to make them indolent and inept, and so they tend to be unable to even look after their own economic interests\\" and that \\"[t]he increase in population should increase the demand for food, which should increase rents, which should be economically beneficial to the landlords\\". According to Smith, the landlords should be in favour of policies which contribute to the growth in the wealth of nations, but they often are not in favour of these pro-growth policies because of their own indolent- induced ignorance and intellectual flabbiness. Critics and market abolitionists such as David McNally argue in the Marxist tradition that the logic of the market inherently produces inequitable outcomes and leads to unequal exchanges, arguing that Smith's moral intent and moral philosophy espousing equal exchange was undermined by the practice of the free market he championed. According to McNally, the development of the market economy involved coercion, exploitation and violence that Smith's moral philosophy could not countenance. The British economist John Maynard Keynes condemned laissez-faire economic policy on several occasions.Dostaler, Gilles, Keynes and His Battles (Edward Elgar Publishing, 2007), p. 91. In The End of Laissez- faire (1926), one of the most famous of his critiques, Keynes argues that the doctrines of laissez-faire are dependent to some extent on improper deductive reasoning and says the question of whether a market solution or state intervention is better must be determined on a case-by-case basis.Dostaler 2007, p. 91; Barnett, Vincent, John Maynard Keynes (Routledge, 2013), p. 143. The Austrian School economist Friedrich Hayek stated that a freely competitive, laissez-faire banking industry tends to be endogenously destabilizing and pro-cyclical, arguing that the need for central banking control was inescapable.

As the most notable architect in England, Jones was the first person to introduce the classical architecture of Rome and the Italian Renaissance to Britain. He left his mark on London by his design of single buildings, such as the Queen's House which is the first building in England designed in a pure classical style, and the Banqueting House, Whitehall, as well as the layout for Covent Garden square which became a model for future developments in the West End. He made major contributions to stage design by his work as theatrical designer for several dozen masques, most by royal command and many in collaboration with Ben Jonson. Early life and career Bust of Inigo Jones by John Michael Rysbrack, 1725 Beyond the fact that he was born in Smithfield, London, the son of Inigo Jones, a Welsh cloth worker, and baptised at the church of St Bartholomew-the-Less, little is known about Jones's early years. He did not approach the architectural profession in the traditional way, namely either by rising up from a craft or through early exposure to the Office of Works, although there is evidence that Christopher Wren obtained information that recorded Jones as an apprentice joiner in St Paul's Churchyard.Colvin, Howard, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects: 1600 to 1840 (1954) At some point before 1603 a rich patron (possibly the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Rutland) sent him to Italy to study drawing after being impressed by the quality of his sketches. From Italy he travelled to Denmark where he worked for King Christian on the design of the palaces of Rosenborg and Frederiksborg. A masque costume for a knight, designed by Inigo Jones Jones first became famous as a designer of costumes and stage settings, especially after he brought \\"masques\\" to the stage. Under the patronage of Queen Anne of Denmark (the consort of King James I), he is credited with introducing movable scenery and the proscenium arch to English theatre. Between 1605 and 1640, he was responsible for staging over 500 performances, collaborating with Ben Jonson for many years, despite a relationship fraught with competition and jealousy: the two had arguments about whether stage design or literature was more important in theatre. (Jonson ridiculed Jones in a series of his works, written over a span of two decades.)See: The Masque of Augurs; The Staple of News; A Tale of a Tub; Love's Welcome at Bolsover. Jonson's follower Richard Brome also took a swipe at Jones in The Weeding of Covent Garden. Over 450 drawings for the scenery and costumes survive, demonstrating Jones's virtuosity as a draughtsman and his development between 1605 and 1609 from initially showing \\"no knowledge of Renaissance draughtsmanship\\" to exhibiting an \\"accomplished Italianate manner\\"Orgel, Steven and Strong, Roy C., Inigo Jones and the theatre of the Stuart Court, 1973 and understanding of Italian set design, particularly that of Alfonso and Giulio Parigi. This development suggests a second visit to Italy, circa 1606,Gotch, A. J., Inigo Jones, 1968 influenced by the ambassador Henry Wotton. Jones learned to speak Italian fluently and there is evidence that he owned an Italian copy of Andrea Palladio's I quattro libri dell'architettura with marginalia that refer to Wotton. His architectural work was particularly influenced by Palladio.The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc., Palladio and English-American Palladianism To a lesser extent, he also held to the architectural principles of the ancient Roman writer Vitruvius. Jones's first recorded architectural design is for a monument to Frances, Lady Cotton, commissioned by Rowland Cotton, circa 1608-1611,Giles Worsley, Inigo Jones and the European Classical Tradition (Yale, 2007), pp. 6, 8-9. at Norton-in-Hales, Shropshire showing early signs of his classical intentions.John Newman, \\"An Early Drawing by Inigo Jones and a Monument in Shropshire\\", The Burlington Magazine 115 (843) (June 1973), pp. 360+ In July 1606 Jones made scenery for a masque at Theobalds for the Earl of Salisbury. In the following years, Jones made drawings for the Earl of Salisbury's New Exchange in the Strand, where work commenced in June 1608,Giles Worsley, Inigo Jones and the European Classical Tradition (Yale, 2007), p. 7. and the central tower of St. Paul's Cathedral, displaying a similar practical architectural inexperience and immature handling of themes from sources including Palladio, Serlio and Sangallo. In 1609, having perhaps accompanied Salisbury's son and heir, Viscount Cranborne, around France, he appears as an architectural consultant at Hatfield House, making small modifications to the design as the project progressed, and in 1610, Jones was appointed Surveyor to Prince Henry. He devised the masques the Barriers and the Masque of Oberon for the Prince and was possibly involved in some alterations to St James's Palace.Edward Chaney and Timothy Wilks, The Jacobean Grand Tour: Early Stuart Travellers in Europe (I.B. Tauris: London, 2014), pp. 64-6, 153. On 27 April 1613, Jones was appointed the position of Surveyor of the King's Works and shortly after, embarked on a tour of Italy with the Earl of Arundel, destined to become one of the most important patrons in the history of English art. On this trip, Jones was exposed to the architecture of Rome, Padua, Florence, Vicenza, Genoa and Venice among others. His surviving sketchbook shows his preoccupation with such artists as Parmigianino and Schiavone. He is also known to have met Vincenzo Scamozzi at this time. His annotated copy of Palladio's Quattro libri dell'architettura also demonstrates his close interest in classical architecture: Jones gave priority to Roman antiquity rather than observing the contemporary fashion in Italy. He was probably the first Englishman to study these Roman remains first hand and this was key to the new architecture Jones introduced in England. Architecture The Queen's House at Greenwich In September 1615, Jones was appointed Surveyor-General of the King's Works, marking the beginning of Jones's career in earnest. Fortunately, both James I and Charles I spent lavishly on their buildings, contrasting hugely with the economical court of Elizabeth I. As the King's Surveyor, Jones built some of his key buildings in London. In 1616, work began on the Queen's House, Greenwich, for James I's wife, Anne. With the foundations laid and the first storey built, work stopped suddenly when Anne died in 1619.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), pp. 67-8. Jones provided a design for the queen's funeral hearse or catafalque, but it was not implemented.Clare McManus, Women on the Renaissance stage (Manchester, 2002), pp. 205-8. Work at Greenwich resumed in 1629, this time for Charles I's Queen, Henrietta Maria. It was finished in 1635 as the first strictly classical building in England, employing ideas found in the architecture of Palladio and ancient Rome. This is Jones's earliest-surviving work. Interior of Banqueting House, with ceiling painted by Rubens Between 1619 and 1622, the Banqueting House in the Palace of Whitehall was built, a design derived from buildings by Scamozzi and Palladio, to which a ceiling painted by Peter Paul Rubens was added several years later. The Whitehall palace was one of several projects where Jones worked with his personal assistant and nephew by marriage John Webb. The Queen's Chapel, St. James's Palace, was built between 1623 and 1627, for Charles I's Roman Catholic wife, Henrietta Maria. Parts of the design originate in the Pantheon of ancient Rome and Jones evidently intended the church to evoke the Roman temple. These buildings show the realisation of a mature architect with a confident grasp of classical principles and an intellectual understanding of how to implement them. St. Paul's Church, Covent Garden The other project in which Jones was involved is the design of Covent Garden square. He was commissioned by the Earl of Bedford to build a residential square, which he did along the lines of the Italian piazza of Livorno. It is the first regularly planned square in London. The Earl felt obliged to provide a church and he warned Jones that he wanted to economise. He told him to simply erect a \\"barn\\" and Jones's oft- quoted response was that his lordship would have \\"the finest barn in Europe\\". In the design of St Paul's, Jones faithfully adhered to Vitruvius's design for a Tuscan temple and it was the first wholly and authentically classical church built in England. The inside of St Paul's, Covent Garden was gutted by fire in 1795, but externally it remains much as Jones designed it and dominates the west side of the piazza. Jones also designed the square of Lincoln's Inn Fields, and a house in the square, the Lindsey House built in 1640, is often attributed to Jones. Its design of a rusticated ground floor with giant pilasters above supporting the entablature and balustrade served as a model for other town houses in London such as John Nash's Regent's Park terraces, as well as in other English towns such as Bath's Royal Crescent. Another large project Jones undertook was the repair and remodelling of St Paul's Cathedral. Between the years of 1634 and 1642, Jones wrestled with the dilapidated Gothicism of Old St Paul's, casing it in classical masonry and totally redesigning the west front. Jones incorporated the giant scrolls from Vignola and della Porta's Church of the Ges√π with a giant Corinthian portico, the largest of its type north of the Alps, but was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Also around this time, circa 1638, Jones devised drawings completely redesigning the Palace of Whitehall, but the execution of these designs was frustrated by Charles I's financial and political difficulties. More than 1000 buildings have been attributed to Jones but only a very small number of those are certain to be his work. According to architecture historian John Summerson, the modern concept of an architect's artistic responsibility for a building did not exist at that time, and Jones's role in many instances may be that of a civil servant in getting things done rather than as an architect. Jones's contribution to a building may also simply be verbal instructions to a mason or bricklayer and providing an Italian engraving or two as a guide, or the correction of drafts. In the 1630s, Jones was in high demand and, as Surveyor to the King, his services were only available to a very limited circle of people, so often projects were commissioned to other members of the Works. Stoke Bruerne Park in Northamptonshire was built by Sir Francis Crane, \\"receiving the assistance of Inigo Jones\\", between 1629 and 1635. Jones is also thought to have been involved in another country house, this time in Wiltshire. Wilton House was renovated from about 1630 onwards, at times worked on by Jones, then passed on to Isaac de Caus when Jones was too busy with royal clients. He then returned in 1646 with his student, John Webb, to try and complete the project. Contemporary equivalent architects included Sir Balthazar Gerbier and Nicholas Stone. One of Jones's design work was \\"double cube\\" room, and it was also the foundation stone of his status as the father of British architecture. Jones, as the pioneer in his era, had strong influence during their time. His revolutionary ideas even effect beyond the Court circle, and today, many scholars believe that he also started the golden age of British architecture. Political and civic life On 16 February 1621, in a by-election caused by the ejection of an existing member Sir John Leedes, Jones was elected M.P. in the Parliament of England for New Shoreham in west Sussex, a borough constituency controlled by the Earl of Arundel, and sat till the dissolution of that parliament in February 1622. He was named to a committee to improve lighting and increase seating in the House of Commons' chamber, resulting in a new gallery being erected in St Stephen's Chapel during the summer recess and was also responsible for a new ceiling put in the House of Lords chamber in 1623. He also served as a Justice of the Peace (J.P.) for the county of Middlesex and borough of Westminster from 1630 until at least 1640. He was made a freeman of the borough of Southampton in 1623 and in 1633 was offered, but declined, a knighthood by Charles I. Later life Inigo Jones, by Anthony Van Dyck Jones's full-time career effectively ended with the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 and the seizure of the King's houses in 1643. Jones was captured at the third siege of Basing House in October 1645. Unfortunately, as one of the last great strongholds to the Cavaliers, the great mansion inside was destroyed by Cromwell's army and even the walls were broken into many pieces. His property was later returned to him (c. 1646) but Jones ended his days, unmarried, living in Somerset House. He was, however, closely involved in the design of Coleshill House, in Berkshire, for the Pratt family, which he visited with the young apprentice architect Roger Pratt, to fix a new site for the proposed mansion. He died on 21 June 1652 and was subsequently buried with his parents at St Benet Paul's Wharf, the Welsh church of the City of London. John Denham and then Christopher Wren followed him as King's Surveyor of Works. A monument dedicated to him in the church, ironically portraying St Paul's Cathedral and other buildings, was destroyed in the Great Fire in 1666. Legacy He was an influence on a number of 18th- century architects, notably Lord Burlington and William Kent. There is an Inigo Jones Road in Charlton, south east London (SE7), near Charlton House, some of whose features were allegedly designed by him. A bridge in Llanrwst, North Wales, named \\"Pont Fawr\\" is also known locally as \\"Pont Inigo Jones\\"‚ÄîInigo Jones's Bridge. He is also said to be responsible for the Masonic Document called \\"The Inigo Jones Manuscript\\", from around 1607. A document of the Old Charges of Freemasonry. .

Except the snow leopard, these species are able to roar. A more liberal and expansive definition of the term includes species outside of Panthera including the cougar, clouded leopard, Sunda clouded leopard, cheetah and sometimes the several lynx species, although these added species also do not roar. Despite enormous differences in size, various cat species are quite similar in both structure and behaviour, with the exception of the cheetah, which significantly stands out from the other big and small cats. All cats are carnivores and some are efficient apex predators.Balme, G. (2005). Counting Cats . Africa Geographic 13: 36‚àí43. Their native ranges include the Americas, Africa, and Asia. Roaring The ability to roar comes from an elongated and specially adapted larynx and hyoid apparatus. When air passes through the larynx on the way from the lungs, the cartilage walls of the larynx vibrate, producing sound. The lion's larynx is longest, giving it the most robust roar. The roar in good conditions can be heard 8 or even 10 km away. All five extant members of the genus Panthera contain this elongated hyoid but owing to differences in the larynx the snow leopard cannot roar. Threats The principal threats to big cats vary by geographic location, but primarily are habitat destruction and poaching. In Africa many big cats are hunted by pastoralists or government 'problem animal control' officers. Certain protected areas exist that shelter large and exceptionally visible populations of African leopards, lions and cheetahs, such as Botswana's Chobe, Kenya's Masai Mara, and Tanzania's Serengeti. Rather, it is outside these conservation areas where hunting poses the dominant threat to large carnivores. In the United States, 19 states have banned ownership of big cats and other dangerous exotic animals as pets, and the Captive Wildlife Safety Act bans the interstate sale and transportation of these animals. The initial Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA) was signed into law on December 19, 2003.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service To address problems associated with the increasing trade in certain big cat species, the CWSA regulations were strengthened by a law passed on September 17, 2007.Federal Register of the U.S. Congress The big cat species addressed in these regulations are the lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, clouded leopard, cheetah, jaguar, cougar, and any hybrid of these species (liger, tigon, etc.). Private ownership is not prohibited, but the law makes it illegal to transport, sell, or purchase such animals in interstate or foreign commerce. Although these regulations seem to provide a strong legal framework for controlling the commerce involving big cats, international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have encouraged the U.S. to further strengthen these laws. The WWF is concerned that weaknesses in the existing U.S. regulations could be unintentionally helping to fuel the black market for tiger parts.America‚Äôs 5,000 Backyard Tigers a Ticking Time Bomb, WWF Says, David Braun, National Geographic, News Watch, October 21, 2010. Conservation An animal sanctuary provides a refuge for animals to live out their natural lives in a protected environment. Usually these animal sanctuaries are the organizations which provide a home to big cats whose private owners are no longer able or willing to care for their big cats. However, use of the word sanctuary in an organization's name is by itself no guarantee that it is a true animal sanctuary in the sense of a refuge. To be accepted by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) as a bona fide animal sanctuary and to be eligible for an exemption from the prohibition of interstate movement of big cats under the Captive Wildlife Safety Act (CWSA), organizations must meet the following criteria:Captive Wildlife Safety Act - What Big Cat Owners Need to Know, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Law Enforcement. *Must be a non-profit entity that is tax exempt under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code *Cannot engage in commercial trade in big cat species, including their offspring, parts, and products made from them *Cannot breed big cats *Cannot allow direct contact between big cats and the public at their facilities *Must keep records of transactions involving covered cats *Must allow the service to inspect their facilities, records, and animals at reasonable hours Species *Family Felidae ** Genus Panthera *** Tiger, Panthera tigris Asia *** Lion, Panthera leo (Sub-Saharan Africa, Gir Forest in India; extinct in former range of southeast Europe, Middle East, much of Asia, and North America) *** Jaguar, Panthera onca (the Americas; from the southern United States to northern Argentina) *** Leopard, Panthera pardus (Asia, Africa and European Russia)Khorozyan, I.

Uncia uncia - mountains of central and south Asia) ** Genus Acinonyx *** Cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus (Sub-Saharan Africa and Iran; extirpated in much of its former range in Eurasia) ** Genus Puma *** Cougar Puma concolor (North and South America) Evolution It is estimated that the ancestors of most big cats split away from the Felinae about 6.37 million years ago. The Felinae, on the other hand, comprises mostly small to medium-sized cats, including the domestic cats, but also some larger cats such as the cougar and cheetah. A 2010 study published in Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution has given insight into the exact evolutionary relationships of the big cats. The study reveals that the snow leopard and the tiger are sister species, while the lion, leopard, and jaguar are more closely related to each other. The tiger and snow leopard diverged from the ancestral big cats approximately 3.9 Ma. The tiger then evolved into a unique species towards the end of the Pliocene epoch, approximately 3.2 Ma. The ancestor of the lion, leopard, and jaguar split from other big cats from 4.3‚Äì3.8 Ma. Between 3.6‚Äì2.5 Ma the jaguar diverged from the ancestor of lions and leopards. Lions and leopards split from one another approximately 2 Ma. The earliest big cat fossil, Panthera blytheae, dating to 4.1‚àí5.95 MA, was discovered in southwest Tibet. Weight range The range of weights exhibited by the species is large. At the bottom, adult snow leopards usually weigh , with an exceptional specimen reaching ,. Male and female lions typically weigh and respectively, and male and female tigers and respectively. Exceptionally heavy male lions and tigers have been recorded to exceed in the wilderness, and weigh around in captivity. The liger can grow to be much larger than its parent species, the lion and tiger. In particular, a liger called 'Nook' is reported to have weighed over .

Although his native language was probably Syriac, all of his extant works are written entirely in Ancient Greek (mostly in the Attic Greek popular during the Second Sophistic period). Everything that is known about Lucian's life comes from his own writings, which are often difficult to interpret because of his extensive use of sarcasm. According to his oration The Dream, he was the son of a lower middle class family from the village of Samosata along the banks of the Euphrates in the remote Roman province of Syria. As a young man, he was apprenticed to his uncle to become a sculptor, but, after a failed attempt at sculpting, he ran away to pursue an education in Ionia. He may have become a travelling lecturer and visited universities throughout the Roman Empire. After acquiring fame and wealth through his teaching, Lucian finally settled down in Athens for a decade, during which he wrote most of his extant works. In his fifties, he may have been appointed as a highly paid government official in Egypt, after which point he disappears from the historical record. Lucian's works were wildly popular in antiquity, and more than eighty writings attributed to him have survived to the present day, a considerably higher quantity than for most other classical writers. His most famous work is A True Story, a tongue-in-cheek satire against authors who tell incredible tales, which is regarded by some as the earliest known work of science fiction. Lucian invented the genre of the comic dialogue, a parody of the traditional Socratic dialogue. His dialogue Lover of Lies makes fun of people who believe in the supernatural and contains the oldest known version of \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\". Lucian wrote numerous satires making fun of traditional stories about the gods including The Dialogues of the Gods, Icaromenippus, Zeus Rants, Zeus Catechized, and The Parliament of the Gods. His Dialogues of the Dead focuses on the Cynic philosophers Diogenes and Menippus. Philosophies for Sale and The Banquet or Lapiths make fun of various philosophical schools, and The Fisherman or the Dead Come to Life is a defense of this mockery. Lucian often ridiculed public figures, such as the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus in his letter The Passing of Peregrinus and the fraudulent oracle Alexander of Abonoteichus in his treatise Alexander the False Prophet. Lucian's treatise On the Syrian Goddess satirizes cultural distinctions between Greeks and Syrians and is the main source of information about the cult of Atargatis. Lucian had an enormous, wide-ranging impact on Western literature. Works inspired by his writings include Thomas More's Utopia, the works of Fran√ßois Rabelais, William Shakespeare's Timon of Athens and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Life=Biographical sources= Lucian is not mentioned in any contemporary texts or inscriptions written by others and he is not included in Philostratus's Lives of the Sophists. As a result of this, everything that is known about Lucian comes exclusively from his own writings. A variety of characters with names very similar to Lucian, including \\"Lukinos,\\" \\"Lukianos,\\" \\"Lucius,\\" and \\"The Syrian\\" appear throughout Lucian's writings. These have been frequently interpreted by scholars and biographers as \\"masks\\", \\"alter-egos\\", or \\"mouthpieces\\" of the author. Daniel S. Richter criticizes the frequent tendency to interpret such \\"Lucian-like figures\\" as self-inserts by the author and argues that they are, in fact, merely fictional characters Lucian uses to \\"think with\\" when satirizing conventional distinctions between Greeks and Syrians. He suggests that they are primarily a literary trope used by Lucian to deflect accusations that he as the Syrian author \\"has somehow outraged the purity of Greek idiom or genre\\" through his invention of the comic dialogue. British classicist Donald Russell states, \\"A good deal of what Lucian says about himself is no more to be trusted than the voyage to the moon that he recounts so persuasively in the first person in True Stories\\" and warns that \\"it is foolish to treat [the information he gives about himself in his writings] as autobiography.\\" =Background and upbringing= Lucian was born in the town of Samosata on the banks of the Euphrates on the far eastern outskirts of the Roman Empire. Samosata had been the capital of the Kingdom of Commagene until 72 AD when it was annexed by Vespasian and became part of the Roman province of Syria. The population of the town was mostly Syrian and Lucian's native tongue was probably Syriac, a form of Middle Aramaic. During the time when Lucian lived, traditional Greco-Roman religion was in decline and its role in society had become largely ceremonial. As a substitute for traditional religion, many people in the Hellenistic world joined mystery cults, such as the Mysteries of Isis, Mithraism, the cult of Cybele, and the Eleusinian Mysteries. Superstition had always been common throughout ancient society, but it was especially prevalent during the second century. Most educated people of Lucian's time adhered to one of the various Hellenistic philosophies, of which the major ones were Stoicism, Platonism, Peripateticism, Pyrrhonism, and Epicureanism. Every major town had its own university and these universities often employed professional travelling lecturers, who were frequently paid high sums of money to lecture about various philosophical teachings. The most prestigious center of learning was the city of Athens in Greece, which had a long intellectual history. According to Lucian's oration The Dream, which classical scholar Lionel Casson states he probably delivered as an address upon returning to Samosata at the age of thirty-five or forty after establishing his reputation as a great orator, Lucian's parents were lower middle class and his uncles owned a local statue-making shop. Lucian's parents could not afford to give him a higher education, so, after he completed his elementary schooling, Lucian's uncle took him on as an apprentice and began teaching him how to sculpt. Lucian, however, soon proved to be poor at sculpting and ruined the statue he had been working on. His uncle beat him, causing him to run off. Lucian fell asleep and experienced a dream in which he was being fought over by the personifications of Statuary and of Culture. He decided to listen to Culture and thus sought out an education. Although The Dream has long been treated by scholars as a truthful autobiography of Lucian, its historical accuracy is questionable at best. Classicist Simon Swain calls it \\"a fine but rather apocryphal version of Lucian's education\\" and Karin Schlapbach calls it \\"ironical\\". Richter argues that it is not autobiographical at all, but rather a prolalia [], or playful literary work, and a \\"complicated meditation on a young man's acquisition of paideia\\" [i.e. education]. Russell dismisses The Dream as entirely fictional, noting, \\"We recall that Socrates too started as sculptor, and Ovid's vision of Elegy and Tragedy (Amores 3.1) is all too similar to Lucian's.\\" =Education and career= Speculative portrayal of Lucian taken from a seventeenth-century engraving by William Faithorne In Lucian's Double Indictment, the personification of Rhetoric delivers a speech in which she describes the unnamed defendant, who is described as a \\"Syrian\\" author of transgressive dialogues, at the time she found him, as a young man wandering in Ionia in Anatolia \\"with no idea what he ought to do with himself.\\" She describes \\"the Syrian\\" at this stage in his career as \\"still speaking in a barbarous manner and all but wearing a caftan [kandys] in the Assyrian fashion\\". Rhetoric states that she \\"took him in hand and... gave him paideia.\\" Scholars have long interpreted the \\"Syrian\\" in this work as Lucian himself and taken this speech to mean that Lucian ran away to Ionia, where he pursued his education. Richter, however, argues that the \\"Syrian\\" is not Lucian himself, but rather a literary device Lucian uses to subvert literary and ethnic norms. Ionia was the center of rhetorical learning at the time The most prestigious universities of rhetoric were in Ephesus and Smyrna, but it is unlikely that Lucian could have afforded to pay the tuition at either of these schools. It is not known how Lucian obtained his education, but somehow he managed to acquire an extensive knowledge of rhetoric as well as classical literature and philosophy. Lucian mentions in his dialogue The Fisherman that he had initially attempted to apply his knowledge of rhetoric and become a lawyer, but that he had become disillusioned by the deceitfulness of the trade and resolved to become a philosopher instead. Lucian travelled across the Empire, lecturing throughout Greece, Italy, and Gaul. In Gaul, Lucian may have held a position as a highly paid government professor. In around 160, Lucian returned to Ionia as a wealthy celebrity. He visited Samosata and stayed in the east for several years. He is recorded as having been in Antioch in either 162 or 163. In around 165, he bought a house in Athens and invited his parents to come live with him in the city. Lucian must have married at some point during his travels, because in one of his writings he mentions having a son at this point. Lucian lived in Athens for around a decade, during which time he gave up lecturing and instead devoted his attention to writing. It was during this decade that Lucian composed nearly all his most famous works. Lucian wrote exclusively in Greek,Eerdmans commentary on the Bible, By James D. G. Dunn, John William Rogerson, p. 1105, . mainly in the Attic Greek popular during the Second Sophistic, but On the Syrian Goddess, which is attributed to Lucian, is written in a highly successful imitation of Herodotus' Ionic Greek, leading some scholars to believe that Lucian may not be the real author. For unknown reasons, Lucian stopped writing around 175 and began travelling and lecturing again. During the reign of Emperor Commodus (180‚Äì92), the aging Lucian may have been appointed to a lucrative government position in Egypt. After this point, he disappears from the historical record entirely, and nothing is known about his death. Views Bust of Epicurus, an Athenian philosopher whom Lucian greatly admired Lucian's philosophical views are difficult to categorize due to his persistent use of irony and sarcasm. In The Fisherman, Lucian describes himself as a champion of philosophy and throughout his other writings he characterizes philosophy as a morally constructive discipline, but he is critical of pseudo-philosophers, whom he portrays as greedy, bad-tempered, sexually immoral hypocrites. Lucian was not known to be a member of any of the major philosophical schools. In his Philosophies for Sale, he makes fun of members of every school. Lucian was critical of Stoicism and Platonism, because he regarded them as encouraging of superstition. His Nigrinus superficially appears to be a \\"eulogy of Platonism\\", but may, in fact, be satirical, or merely an excuse to ridicule Roman society. Nonetheless, at other times, Lucian writes approvingly of individual philosophies. According to Turner, although Lucian makes fun of Skeptic philosophers, he displays a temperamental inclination towards that philosophy. Edwyn Bevan identifies Lucian as a Skeptic, Edwyn Bevan, Stoics And Sceptics 1913 p. 110 https://archive.org/details/stoicsandsceptic033554mbp/page/n6/mode/2up and in his Hermotimus, Lucian rejects all philosophical systems as contradictory and concludes that life is too short to determine which of them comes nearest to the truth, so the best solution is to rely on common sense, which was what the Pyrrhonian Skeptics advocated. The maxim that \\"Eyes are better witnesses than ears\\" is echoed repeatedly throughout several of Lucian's dialogues. Lucian was skeptical of oracles, though he was by no means the only person of his time to voice such skepticism. Lucian rejected belief in the paranormal, regarding it as superstition. In his dialogue The Lover of Lies, he probably voices some of his own opinions through his character Tychiades, perhaps including the declaration by Tychiades that he does not believe in daemones, phantoms, or ghosts because he has never seen such things. Tychiades, however, still professes belief in the gods' existence: :Dinomachus: 'In other words, you do not believe in the existence of the Gods, since you maintain that cures cannot be wrought by the use of holy names?' :Tychiades: 'Nay, say not so, my dear Dinomachus,' I answered; 'the Gods may exist, and these things may yet be lies. I respect the Gods: I see the cures performed by them, I see their beneficence at work in restoring the sick through the medium of the medical faculty and their drugs. Asclepius, and his sons after him, compounded soothing medicines and healed the sick, ‚Äì without the lion's-skin-and-field- mouse process.'Lucian, The Lover of Lies, translated by H. W. and F. G. Fowler. According to Everett Ferguson, Lucian was strongly influenced by the Cynics. The Dream or the Cock, Timon the Misanthrope, Charon or Inspectors, and The Downward Journey or the Tyrant all display Cynic themes. Lucian was particularly indebted to Menippus, a Cynic philosopher and satirist of the third century BC. Lucian wrote an admiring biography of the philosopher Demonax, who was a philosophical eclectic, but whose ideology most closely resembled Cynicism. Demonax's main divergence from the Cynics was that he did not disapprove of ordinary life. Paul Turner observes that Lucian's Cynicus reads as a straightforward defense of Cynicism, but also remarks that Lucian savagely ridicules the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus in his Passing of Peregrinus. Lucian also greatly admired Epicurus, whom he describes in Alexander the False Prophet as \\"truly holy and prophetic\\". Later, in the same dialogue, he praises a book written by Epicurus: > What blessings that book creates for its readers and what peace, > tranquillity, and freedom it engenders in them, liberating them as it does > from terrors and apparitions and portents, from vain hopes and extravagant > cravings, developing in them intelligence and truth, and truly purifying > their understanding, not with torches and squills [i. e. sea onions] and > that sort of foolery, but with straight thinking, truthfulness and > frankness. Lucian had a generally negative opinion of Herodotus and his historiography, which he viewed as faulty. Works Over eighty works attributed to Lucian have survived. These works belong to a diverse variety of styles and genres, and include comic dialogues, rhetorical essays, and prose fiction. Lucian's writings were targeted towards a highly educated, upper-class Greek audience and make almost constant allusions to Greek cultural history, leading the classical scholar R. Bracht Branham to label Lucian's highly sophisticated style \\"the comedy of tradition\\". By the time Lucian's writings were rediscovered during the Renaissance, most of the works of literature referenced in them had been lost or forgotten, making it difficult for readers of later periods to understand his works. =A True Story= Illustration from 1894 by William Strang depicting a battle scene from Book One of Lucian's novel A True Story Lucian was one of the earliest novelists in Western civilization. In A True Story (), a fictional narrative work written in prose, he parodies some of the fantastic tales told by Homer in the Odyssey and also the not-so-fantastic tales from the historian Thucydides.C. Robinson, Lucian and his Influence in Europe (London, 1979), 23‚Äì25.A. Bartley, 2003, \\"The Implications of the Reception of Thucydides within Lucian's 'Vera Historia'\\", Hermes Heft, 131, pp. 222‚Äì234. He anticipated modern science fiction themes including voyages to the moon and Venus, extraterrestrial life, interplanetary warfare, and artificial life, nearly two millennia before Jules Verne and H. G. Wells. The novel is often regarded as the earliest known work of science fiction.Grewell, Greg: \\"Colonizing the Universe: Science Fictions Then, Now, and in the (Imagined) Future\\", Rocky Mountain Review of Language and Literature, Vol. 55, No. 2 (2001), pp. 25‚Äì47 (30f.).Fredericks, S.C.: ‚ÄúLucian's True History as SF‚Äù, Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 1 (March 1976), pp. 49‚Äì60.Swanson, Roy Arthur: \\"The True, the False, and the Truly False: Lucian's Philosophical Science Fiction\\", Science Fiction Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3 (November 1976), pp. 227‚Äì239.Georgiadou, Aristoula & Larmour, David H. J.: \\"Lucian's Science Fiction Novel True Histories. Interpretation and Commentary\\", Mnemosyne Supplement 179, Leiden, 1998, , IntroductionGunn, James E.: The New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Publisher: Viking 1988, , p. 249. The novel begins with an explanation that the story is not at all \\"true\\" and that everything in it is, in fact, a complete and utter lie. The narrative begins with Lucian and his fellow travelers journeying out past the Pillars of Heracles. Blown off course by a storm, they come to an island with a river of wine filled with fish and bears, a marker indicating that Heracles and Dionysus have traveled to this point, and trees that look like women. Shortly after leaving the island, they are caught up by a whirlwind and taken to the Moon, where they find themselves embroiled in a full-scale war between the king of the Moon and the king of the Sun over colonization of the Morning Star. Both armies include bizarre hybrid lifeforms. The armies of the Sun win the war by clouding over the Moon and blocking out the Sun's light. Both parties then come to a peace agreement. Lucian then describes life on the Moon and how it is different from life on Earth. After returning to Earth, the adventurers are swallowed by a 200-mile-long whale, in whose belly they discover a variety of fish people, whom they wage war against and triumph over. They kill the whale by starting a bonfire and escape by propping its mouth open. Next, they encounter a sea of milk, an island of cheese, and the Island of the Blessed. There, Lucian meets the heroes of the Trojan War, other mythical men and animals, as well as Homer and Pythagoras. They find sinners being punished, the worst of them being the ones who had written books with lies and fantasies, including Herodotus and Ctesias. After leaving the Island of the Blessed, they deliver a letter to Calypso given to them by Odysseus explaining that he wishes he had stayed with her so he could have lived eternally. They then discover a chasm in the Ocean, but eventually sail around it, discover a far-off continent and decide to explore it. The book ends abruptly with Lucian stating that their future adventures will be described in the upcoming sequels, a promise which a disappointed scholiast described as \\"the biggest lie of all\\". =Satirical dialogues= In his Double Indictment, Lucian declares that his proudest literary achievement is the invention of the \\"satirical dialogue\\", which was modeled on the earlier Platonic dialogue, but was comedic in tone rather than philosophical. The prolaliai to his Dialogues of the Courtesans suggests that Lucian acted out his dialogues himself as part of a comedic routine. Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead () is a satirical work centering around the Cynic philosophers Diogenes of Sinope and his pupil Menippus, who lived modestly while they were alive and are now living comfortably in the abysmal conditions of the Underworld, while those who had lived lives of luxury are in torment when faced by the same conditions. The dialogue draws on earlier literary precursors, including the nekyia in Book XI of Homer's Odyssey, but also adds new elements not found in them. Homer's nekyia describes transgressors against the gods being punished for their sins, but Lucian embellished this idea by having cruel and greedy persons also be punished. Hermes, the messenger of the gods, is a major recurring character throughout many of Lucian's dialogues. In his dialogue The Lover of Lies (), Lucian satirizes belief in the supernatural and paranormal through a framing story in which the main narrator, a skeptic named Tychiades, goes to visit an elderly friend named Eukrates. At Eukrates's house, he encounters a large group of guests who have recently gathered together due to Eukrates suddenly falling ill. The other guests offer Eukrates a variety of folk remedies to help him recover. When Tychiades objects that such remedies do not work, the others all laugh at him and try to persuade him to believe in the supernatural by telling him stories, which grow increasingly ridiculous as the conversation progresses. One of the last stories they tell is \\"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\\", which the German playwright Johann Wolfgang von Goethe later adapted into a famous ballad. Lucian frequently made fun of philosophers and no school was spared from his mockery. In the dialogue Philosophies for Sale, Lucian creates an imaginary slave market in which Zeus puts famous philosophers up for sale, including Pythagoras, Diogenes, Heraclitus, Socrates, Chrysippus, and Pyrrho, each of whom attempts to persuade the customers to buy his philosophy. In The Banquet, or Lapiths, Lucian points out the hypocrisies of representatives from all the major philosophical schools. In The Fisherman, or the Dead Come to Life, Lucian defends his other dialogues by comparing the venerable philosophers of ancient times with their unworthy contemporary followers. Lucian was often particularly critical of people who pretended to be philosophers when they really were not and his dialogue The Runaways portrays an imposter Cynic as the antithesis of true philosophy. His Symposium is a parody of Plato's Symposium in which, instead of discussing the nature of love, the philosophers get drunk, tell smutty tales, argue relentlessly over whose school is the best, and eventually break out into a full-scale brawl. In Icaromenippus, the Cynic philosopher Menippus fashions a set of wings for himself in imitation of the mythical Icarus and flies to Heaven, where he receives a guided tour from Zeus himself. The dialogue ends with Zeus announcing his decision to destroy all philosophers, since all they do is bicker, though he agrees to grant them a temporary reprieve until spring. Nektyomanteia is a dialogue written in parallel to Icaromenippus in which, rather than flying to Heaven, Menippus descends to the underworld to consult the prophet Tiresias. Lucian wrote numerous dialogues making fun of traditional Greek stories about the gods. His Dialogues of the Gods () consists of numerous short vignettes parodying a variety of the scenes from Greek mythology. The dialogues portray the gods as comically weak and prone to all the foibles of human emotion. Zeus in particular is shown to be a \\"feckless ruler\\" and a serial adulterer. Lucian also wrote several other works in a similar vein, including Zeus Catechized, Zeus Rants, and The Parliament of the Gods. Throughout all his dialogues, Lucian displays a particular fascination with Hermes, the messenger of the gods, who frequently appears as a major character in the role of an intermediary who travels between worlds. The Dialogues of the Courtesans is a collection of short dialogues involving various courtesans. This collection is unique as one of the only surviving works of Greek literature to mention female homosexuality. It is also unusual for mixing Lucian's characters from other dialogues with stock characters from New Comedy; over half of the men mentioned in Dialogues of the Courtesans are also mentioned in Lucian's other dialogues, but almost all of the courtesans themselves are characters borrowed from the plays of Menander and other comedic playwrights. =Treatises and letters= Lucian's treatise Alexander the False Prophet describes the rise of Alexander of Abonoteichus, a charlatan who claimed to be the prophet of the serpent-god Glycon. Though the account is satirical in tone, it seems to be a largely accurate report of the Glycon cult and many of Lucian's statements about the cult have been confirmed through archaeological evidence, including coins, statues, and inscriptions. Lucian describes his own meeting with Alexander in which he posed as a friendly philosopher, but, when Alexander invited him to kiss his hand, Lucian bit it instead. Lucian reports that, aside from himself, the only others who dared challenge Alexander's reputation as a true prophet were the Epicureans (whom he lauds as heroes) and the Christians. Lucian's treatise On the Syrian Goddess is a detailed description of the cult of the Syrian goddess Atargatis at Hierapolis (now Manbij). It is written in a faux-Ionic Greek and imitates the ethnographic methodology of the Greek historian Herodotus, which Lucian elsewhere derides as faulty. For generations, many scholars doubted the authenticity of On the Syrian Goddess because it seemed too genuinely reverent to have really been written by Lucian. More recently, scholars have come to recognize the book as satirical and have restored its Lucianic authorship. In the treatise, Lucian satirizes the arbitrary cultural distinctions between \\"Greeks\\" and \\"Assyrians\\" by emphasizing the manner in which Syrians have adopted Greek customs and thereby effectively become \\"Greeks\\" themselves. The anonymous narrator of the treatise initially seems to be a Greek Sophist, but, as the treatise progresses, he reveals himself to actually be a native Syrian. Scholars dispute whether the treatise is an accurate description of Syrian cultural practices because very little is known about Hierapolis other than what is recorded in On the Syrian Goddess itself. Coins minted in the late fourth century BC, municipal decrees from Seleucid rulers, and a late Hellenistic relief carving have confirmed Lucian's statement that the city's original name was Manbog and that the city was closely associated with the cults of Atargatis and Hadad. A Jewish rabbi later listed the temple at Hierapolis as one of the five most important pagan temples in the Near East. Macrobii (\\"Long-Livers\\") is an essay about famous philosophers who lived for many years. It describes how long each of them lived, and gives an account of each of their deaths. In his treatises Teacher of Rhetoric and On Salaried Posts, Lucian criticizes the teachings of master rhetoricians. His treatise On Dancing is a major source of information about Greco-Roman dance. In it, he describes dance as an act of mimesis (\\"imitation\\") and rationalizes the myth of Proteus as being nothing more than an account of a highly skilled Egyptian dancer. He also wrote about visual arts in Portraits and On Behalf of Portraits. Lucian's biography of the philosopher Demonax eulogizes him as a great philosopher and portrays him as a hero of parrhesia (\\"boldness of speech\\"). In his treatise, How to Write History, Lucian criticizes the historical methodology used by writers such as Herodotus and Ctesias, who wrote vivid and self-indulgent descriptions of events they had never actually seen. Instead, Lucian argues that the historian never embellish his stories and should place his commitment to accuracy above his desire to entertain his audience. He also argues the historian should remain absolutely impartial and tell the events as they really happened, even if they are likely to cause disapproval. Lucian names Thucydides as a specific example of a historian who models these virtues. In his satirical letter Passing of Peregrinus (), Lucian describes the death of the controversial Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus, who had publicly immolated himself on a pyre at the Olympic Games of AD 165. The letter is historically significant because it preserves one of the earliest pagan evaluations of Christianity. In the letter, one of Lucian's characters delivers a speech ridiculing Christians for their perceived credulity and ignorance, but he also affords them some level of respect on account of their morality. The speaker in the letter also refers to an individual whom he calls \\"Christ\\", whom he characterizes as the founder of Christianity. The speaker claims that this \\"Christ\\" lived in Palestine just over a century prior, that he taught that his followers would attain immortality, and that he was crucified. In the letter Against the Ignorant Book Collector, Lucian ridicules the common practice whereby Near Easterners collect massive libraries of Greek texts for the sake of appearing \\"cultured\\", but without actually reading any of them. =Pseudo-Lucian= Some of the writings attributed to Lucian, such as the Amores and the Ass, are usually not considered genuine works of Lucian and are normally cited under the name of \\"Pseudo-Lucian\\".* The Ass () is probably a summarized version of a story by Lucian, and contains largely the same basic plot elements as The Golden Ass (or Metamorphoses) of Apuleius, but with fewer inset tales and a different ending. Amores is usually dated to the third or fourth centuries based on stylistic grounds. Legacy=Renaissance and Reformation= The Calumny of Apelles by Sandro Botticelli, based on a description of a painting by the Greek painter Apelles of Kos found in Lucian's ekphrasis On Calumny Lucian's writings were mostly forgotten during the Middle Ages. The Suda, a tenth- century Byzantine encyclopedia, concludes that Lucian's soul is burning in Hell for his negative remarks about Christians in the Passing of Peregrinus. Lucian's writings were rediscovered during the Renaissance and almost immediately became popular with the Renaissance humanists. By 1400, there were just as many Latin translations of the works of Lucian as there were for the writings of Plato and Plutarch. By ridiculing plutocracy as absurd, Lucian helped facilitate one of Renaissance humanism's most basic themes. His Dialogues of the Dead were especially popular and were widely used for moral instruction. As a result of this popularity, Lucian's writings had a profound influence on writers from the Renaissance and the Early Modern period. Many early modern European writers adopted Lucian's lighthearted tone, his technique of relating a fantastic voyage through a familiar dialogue, and his trick of constructing proper names with deliberately humorous etymological meanings. During the Protestant Reformation, Lucian provided literary precedent for writers making fun of Catholic clergy. Desiderius Erasmus's Encomium Moriae (1509) displays Lucianic influences. Perhaps the most notable example of Lucian's impact was on the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was on the French writer Fran√ßois Rabelais, particularly in his set of five novels, Gargantua and Pantagruel, which was first published in 1532. Rabelais also is thought to be responsible for a primary introduction of Lucian to the French Renaissance and beyond through his translations of Lucian's works.Pattard, Jean. Rebelais Works. Champion Publishers. 1909. pp. 204‚Äì215Screech, M.A. Rebelais. Ithaca; Cornell Press. 1979. pp. 7‚Äì11. Lucian's True Story inspired both Sir Thomas More's Utopia (1516) and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726). Sandro Botticelli's paintings The Calumny of Apelles and Pallas and the Centaur are both based on descriptions of paintings found in Lucian's works. Lucian's prose narrative Timon the Misanthrope was the inspiration for William Shakespeare's tragedy Timon of AthensArmstrong, A. Macc. \\"Timon of Athens ‚Äì A Legendary Figure?\\", Greece & Rome, 2nd Ser., Vol. 34, No. 1 (April 1987), pp. 7‚Äì11. and the scene from Hamlet with the gravediggers echoes several scenes from Dialogues of the Dead. Christopher Marlowe's famous verse \\"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/And burnt the topless towers of Ilium?\\" is a paraphrase of a quote from Lucian. Francis Bacon called Lucian a \\"contemplative atheist\\". =Early Modern Period= Monument commemorating Lucian of Samosata from Nordkirchen, Germany Henry Fielding, the author of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling (1749), owned a complete set of Lucian's writings in nine volumes. He deliberately imitated Lucian in his Journey from This World and into the Next and, in The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great (1743), he describes Lucian as \\"almost... like the true father of humour\\" and lists him alongside Miguel de Cervantes and Jonathan Swift as a true master of satire. In The Convent Garden Journal, Fielding directly states in regard to Lucian that he had modeled his style \\"upon that very author\\". Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux, Fran√ßois F√©nelon, Bernard Le Bovier de Fontenelle, and Voltaire all wrote adaptations of Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead. According to Turner, Voltaire's Candide (1759) displays the characteristically Lucianic theme of \\"refuting philosophical theory by reality\\". Voltaire also wrote The Conversation between Lucian, Erasmus and Rabelais in the Elysian Fields, a dialogue in which he treats Lucian as \\"one of his masters in the strategy of intellectual revolution.\\" Denis Diderot drew inspiration from the writings of Lucian in his Socrates Gone Mad; or, the Dialogues of Diogenes of Sinope (1770) and his Conversations in Elysium (1780). Lucian appears as one of two speakers in Diderot's dialogue Peregrinus Proteus (1791), which was based on The Passing of Peregrinus. Lucian's True Story inspired Cyrano de Bergerac, whose writings later served as inspiration for Jules Verne. The German satirist Christoph Martin Wieland was the first person to translate the complete works of Lucian into German and he spent his entire career adapting the ideas behind Lucian's writings for a contemporary German audience. David Hume admired Lucian as a \\"very moral writer\\" and quoted him with reverence when discussing ethics or religion. Hume read Lucian's Kataplous or Downward Journey when he was on his deathbed. =Modern Period= Kataplous, or Downward Journey also served as the source for Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of the √úbermensch or Overman. Nietzsche's declaration of a \\"new and super- human way of laughing ‚Äì at the expense of everything serious!\\" echoes the exact wording of Tiresias's final advice to the eponymous hero of Lucian's dialogue Menippus: \\"Laugh a great deal and take nothing seriously.\\" Professional philosophical writers since then have generally ignored Lucian, but Turner comments that \\"perhaps his spirit is still alive in those who, like Bertrand Russell, are prepared to flavor philosophy with wit.\\" In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many classicists viewed Lucian's works negatively and read them with preconceived ideas in mind about the \\"Oriental\\" character. Many of these ideas were influenced by contemporary antisemitism, a \\"reflexive and genteel\\" form of which was common throughout English and German scholarly writings prior to World War II. The German classicist Eduard Norden admitted that he had, as a foolish youth, wasted time reading the works of Lucian, but, as an adult, had come to realize that Lucian was nothing more than an \\"Oriental without depth or character... who has no soul and degrades the most soulful language.\\" Rudolf Helm, one of the leading scholars on Lucian in the early twentieth century, labelled Lucian as a \\"thoughtless Syrian\\" who \\"possesses none of the soul of a tragedian\\" and compared him to the Jewish German poet Heinrich Heine, who was known as the \\"mockingbird in the German poetry forest.\\" In his 1906 publication Lukian und Menipp, Helm argued that Lucian's claims of generic originality, especially his claim of having invented the comic dialogue, were actually lies intended to cover up his almost complete dependence on Menippus, whom he asserted was the true inventor of the genre. Lucian's Syrian identity received renewed attention in the early twenty-first century as Lucian became seen as what Richter calls \\"a sort of Second Sophistic answer to early twenty-first-century questions about cultural and ethnic hybridity.\\" Richter states that Postcolonial critics have come to embrace Lucian as \\"an early imperial paradigm of the 'ethno-cultural hybrid.'\\" Editions * Lucian‚Äôs True History, with illustrations by Aubrey Beardsley, William Strang, and J.

Using the right hand is generally considered proper etiquette. Customs surrounding handshakes are specific to cultures. Different cultures may be more or less likely to shake hands, or there may be different customs about how or when to shake hands.Fist bump can pound out flu transmission __TOC__ History Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (right) shakes the hand of Babylonian king Marduk-zakir-shumi I (left), 9th century BC The handshake is believed by some to have originated as a gesture of peace by demonstrating that the hand holds no weapon in prehistory. One of the earliest known depictions of a handshake is an ancient Assyrian relief of the 9th century BC depicting the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III shaking the hand of the Babylonian king Marduk-zakir-shumi I to seal an alliance.Hera and Athena handshaking, late 5th century BC, Acropolis Museum, Athens Archaeological ruins and ancient texts show that handshaking ‚Äì also known as dexiosis ‚Äì was practiced in ancient Greece as far back as the 5th century BC; a depiction of two soldiers shaking hands can be found on part of a 5th-century BC funerary stele on display in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin (stele SK1708) and other funerary steles like the one of the 4th century BC which depicts Thraseas and his wife Euandria handshaking. In addition, handshake appeared on Archaic Greek, Etruscan and Roman funerary and non-funerary art.

Note the left-handed handshake. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, U.S. President Bill Clinton, and Yasser Arafat at the Oslo Accords signing ceremony on 13 September 1993 There are various customs surrounding handshakes, both generally and specific to certain cultures: The handshake is commonly done upon meeting, greeting, parting, offering congratulations, expressing gratitude, or as a public sign of completing a business or diplomatic agreement. In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good sportsmanship. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality. If it is done to form an agreement, the agreement is not official until the hands are parted. L. K. Relander (on right in middle), the second President of the Republic of Finland, handshake with Vihtori Kosola (on left in middle), the leader of the far-right Lapua Movement; the gesture of Relander, already considered a weak and inexperienced president at the time, was seen as a good example of Relander's recklessness.[https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/628 Relander, Lauri Kristian (1883 - 1942) ‚Äì Kansallisbiografia ] Unless health issues or local customs dictate otherwise, a handshake is made usually with bare hands. However, it depends on the situation. * In Anglophone countries, handshaking is common in business situations. In casual non-business situations, men are more likely to shake hands than women. * In the Netherlands and Belgium, handshakes are done more often, especially on meeting. * In Switzerland, it may be expected to shake the women's hands first. * Austrians shake hands when meeting, often including with children. * In the United States a traditional handshake is firm, executed with the right hand, with good posture and eye contact. * In Russia, a handshake is performed by men and rarely performed by women. * Hand shaking between men and women is not encouraged in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Pakistan, Iran, etc. where the majority religion is Islam. As a general rule, in these countries, men are not allowed to get close to the opposite sex or touch them. Within the Muslim world, Turkey is an exception where men and women can shake hands with each other. * In some countries such as Turkey or the Arabic-speaking Middle East, handshakes are not as firm as in the West. Consequently, a grip that is too firm is rude. * Moroccans also give one kiss on each cheek (to corresponding genders) together with the handshake. Also, in some countries, a variation exists where instead of kisses, and the handshake the palm is then placed on the heart. * In China, age is considered important in handshake etiquette, and older people should be greeted with a handshake before others. A weak handshake is also preferred, but people shaking hands often hold on to each other's hands for an extended period after the initial handshake. * In Japan, it is appropriate to let the Japanese initiate the handshake, and a weak handshake is preferred. The Japanese do not have a tradition of shaking hands and prefer to formally bow (with hands open by their sides) to each other, but they will greet non-Japanese with a handshake. * In India and several nearby countries, the respectful Namaste gesture, sometimes combined with a slight bow, is traditionally used in place of handshakes. However, handshakes are preferred in business and other formal settings. * In Norway, where a firm handshake is preferred, people will most often shake hands when agreeing on deals, in private and business relations. * In Korea, a senior person will initiate a handshake, which is preferred to be weak. It is a sign of respect to grasp the right arm with the left hand when shaking hands. It is considered disrespectful to put the free hand in one's pocket while shaking hands. Bowing is the preferred and conventional way of greeting a person in Korea. * Related to a handshake but more casual, some people prefer a fist bump. Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings. * The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of \\"cocoon\\". * Another version popular with politicians is a \\"photo-op handshake\\" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds. * Scouts shake hands with their left hand as a gesture of trust, a practice which originated when the founder of the movement, Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell, then a British cavalry officer, met an African tribesman. *In some areas of Africa, handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation. * Masai men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time. * In Liberia, the snap handshake is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake. * In Ethiopia, it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right. This is especially important if it is the first time. *In Thailand, handshaking is only done if the traditional wai is not offered. When a person offers a wai, placing their palms together at chest level and bowing. This is then returned, with men saying ‚ÄúSawadee-krap‚Äù and women, saying ‚ÄúSawadee-kah‚Äù (both mean ‚ÄúHello\\").  Germ spreading  Handshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as scabies are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that fist bumps and high fives spread fewer germs than handshakes. In light of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the dean of medicine at the University of Calgary, Tomas Feasby, suggested that fist bumps may be a \\"nice replacement of the handshake\\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus. Following a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at UCLA hospital, decided to test \\"a handshake-free zone\\" as a method for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease. However, UCLA did not allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact Namaste gestures. Other sources suggest raised brows, smiling, wai bow, two claps, hand over heart, sign language wave, or the shaka sign.Stop shaking hands. Do this instead, Scottie Andrew, CNN Travel, 17 April 2020. https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/handshake-alternatives-gestures-around- world-trnd/index.html During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries and organisations adopted policies encouraging people to use alternative modes of greeting instead of a handshake.BBC News, Coronavirus: Dutch PM tells nation not to shake hands ‚Äì then does, published 10 March 2020, accessed 14 March 2020 Suggested alternatives have included the elbow bump, the fist bump, foot tapping (\\"Wuhan Shake\\")BBC News, Coronavirus: The 'Wuhan shake' or the elbow bump?, published 3 March 2020, accessed 17 May 2020 or non-contact actions for social distancing purposes, such as a namaste gesture. Chemosignaling It has been discovered as a part of a research in the Weizmann Institute, that human handshakes serve as a means of transferring social chemical signals between the shakers. It appears that there is a tendency to bring the shaken hands to the vicinity of the nose and smell them. They may serve an evolutionary need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or rural Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual). World records In 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals' hands in hours, in Wrexham, N. Wales. Atlantic City, New Jersey Mayor Joseph Lazarow was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records for a July 1977 publicity stunt, in which the mayor shook more than 11,000 hands in a single day, breaking the record previously held by President Theodore Roosevelt, who had set the record with 8,510 handshakes at a White House reception on 1 January 1907. Dowson's record was recognised by the Guinness World Records Organisation and published in their 1964 publication. On 31 August 1987, Stephen Potter from St Albans shook 19,550 hands at the St Albans Carnival to take the world record for shaking most hands verified by the Guinness Book of World Records. The record has since been exceeded but has been retired from the book. Potter still holds the British and European record. On 15 August 2008 Kirk Williamson and Richard McCulley broke the Guinness World Record for the World's Longest Handshake (single hand) when they met at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii and shook hands for 10 hours, besting the previous record of 9 hours and 19 minutes set in 2006. On 21 September 2009, Jack Tsonis and Lindsay Morrison then broke that record by shaking hands for 12 hours, 34 minutes and 56 seconds. Their record was broken less than a month later in Claremont, California, when John- Clark Levin and George Posner shook hands for 15 hours, 15 minutes, and 15 seconds. The next month, on 21 November, Matthew Rosen and Joe Ackerman surpassed this feat, with a new world record time of 15 hours, 30 minutes and 45 seconds certified in an edition of the Guinness Book of Records on page 111. At 8 p.m. EST on Friday 14 January 2011 a new attempt at the longest hand-shake commenced in New York Times Square and the existing record was broken by semi-professional world record-breaker Alastair Galpin and Don Purdon from New Zealand and Nepalese brothers Rohit and Santosh Timilsina who agreed to share the new record after 33 hours and 3 minutes. On 29 January 2020, a new world record for the longest handshaking relay was set by approximately 1,817 people in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates at Umm Al Emarat Park in an event organized by the Abu Dhabi Police to celebrate the 1 year anniversary of the signing of the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together in the city.

Non- romantic friends may also hold hands, although acceptance of this varies by culture and gender role. Parents or guardians may hold the hands of small children to exercise guidance or authority. In terms of romance, handholding is often used in the early stages of dating or courtship to express romantic interest in a partner. Handholding is also common in advanced stages of a romantic relationship where it may be used to signify or seek solace and reassurance. Same-sex couples may avoid holding hands in public due to homophobia. In 2012, an average of 74% of gay men and 51% of lesbian women responded to an EU Fundamental Rights Agency survey saying they avoid holding hands in public for fear of harassment or assault.

It was named by the French botanist Augustin Saint-Hilaire. The indigenous Guaran√≠ and some Tup√≠ communities (whose territory covered present-day Paraguay, the Misiones province of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay) first cultivated and used yerba mate prior to European colonization of the Americas. The leaves of the plant are steeped in hot water to make a beverage known as mate. When served cold, it is called terer√© in the Guarani language. Both the plant and the beverage contain caffeine. Mate is traditionally consumed in central and southern regions of South America, primarily in Paraguay, as well as in Argentina, Uruguay, southern and central-western Brazil, the Gran Chaco of Bolivia, and southern Chile. It has also become popular in the Druze community in the Levant, especially in Syria and Lebanon, where it is imported from Argentina, thanks to 19th-century Syrian immigrants from Argentina. Yerba mate can now be found worldwide in various energy drinks as well as being sold as a bottled or canned iced tea. Name and pronunciation The name given to the plant in the Guaran√≠, language of the indigenous people who first used mate, is , which has the same meaning as \\"herb\\". , in Portuguese, is derived from the Tupi expression, meaning something like \\"what keeps us alive\\", but a term rarely used nowadays.

In English, both the spellings \\"mate\\" and \\"mat√©\\" are used to refer to the plant or beverage, but the latter spelling is incorrect in both Spanish and Portuguese, as it would put the stress on the second syllable, while the word is correctly pronounced with the stress on the first syllable. The addition of the acute accent over the final \\"e\\" in the English spelling was likely added as a hypercorrection to indicate that the final \\"-√©\\" is not silent.

The leaves are evergreen, long and wide, with serrated margins. The leaves are often called (Spanish) or (Portuguese), both of which mean \\"herb\\". They contain caffeine (known in some parts of the world as mateine) and related xanthine alkaloids, and are harvested commercially. The flowers are small and greenish-white with four petals. The fruit is a red drupe in diameter. History Yerba mate growing in the wild Mate was first consumed by the indigenous Guaran√≠ people and also spread in the Tup√≠ people that lived in southern Brazil and Paraguay. Its consumption became widespread during European colonization, particularly in the Spanish colony of Paraguay in the late 16th century, among both Spanish settlers and indigenous Guaran√≠, who had, to some extent before the Spanish arrival, consumed it. This widespread consumption turned it into Paraguay's main commodity above other wares, such as tobacco, and the labour of indigenous peoples was used to harvest wild stands. In the mid-17th century, Jesuits managed to domesticate the plant and establish plantations in their Indian reductions in Misiones, Argentina, sparking severe competition with the Paraguayan harvesters of wild stands. After their expulsion in the 1770s, their plantations fell into decay, as did their domestication secrets. The industry continued to be of prime importance for the Paraguayan economy after independence, but development in benefit of the Paraguayan state halted after the War of the Triple Alliance (1864‚Äì1870) that devastated the country both economically and demographically. Some regions with mate plantations in Paraguay became Argentine territory.

Retrieved 10 July 2013 In Brazilian and Argentine projects in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the plant was domesticated once again, opening the way for plantation systems. When Brazilian entrepreneurs turned their attention to coffee in the 1930s, Argentina, which had long been the prime consumer, took over as the largest producer, resurrecting the economy in Misiones Province, where the Jesuits had once had most of their plantations. For years, the status of largest producer shifted between Brazil and Argentina. Today, Brazil is the largest producer, with 53%, followed by Argentina, 37%, and Paraguay, 10%.List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor In the city of Campo Largo, state of Paran√°, Brazil, there is a Mate Historic Park (), funded by the state government to educate people on the sustainable harvesting methods needed to maintain the integrity and vitality of the oldest wild forests of mate in the world.

Cultivation Plantation in Misiones, Argentina New growth evident on young yerba mate plant The yerba mate plant is grown and processed in its native regions of South America, specifically in northern Argentina (Corrientes and Misiones), Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Paran√°, and Mato Grosso do Sul). Cultivators are known as (Spanish) or (Brazilian Portuguese). Seeds used to germinate new plants are harvested after they have turned dark purple, typically from January to April. After harvest, they are submerged in water in order to eliminate floating non-viable seeds and detritus like twigs, leaves, etc. New plants are started between March and May. For plants established in pots, transplanting takes place April through September. Plants with bare roots are transplanted only during the months of June and July.Burtnik, Oscar Jos√©, \\"Yerba Mate Production\\", 3rd Edition, 2006.

Insect pests include Gyropsylla spegazziniana, a true bug that lays eggs in the branches; Hedyphates betulinus, a type of beetle that weakens the tree and makes it more susceptible to mold and mildew; Perigonia lusca, a moth whose larvae eat the leaves; and several species of mites. When I. paraguariensis is harvested, the branches are often dried by a wood fire, imparting a smoky flavor. The strength of the flavor, caffeine levels, and other nutrients can vary depending on whether it is a male or female plant. Female plants tend to be milder in flavor and lower in caffeine. They are also relatively scarce in the areas where yerba mate is planted and cultivated. According to FAO in 2012, Brazil is the biggest producer of mate in the world with 513,256 MT (58%), followed by Argentina with 290,000 MT (32%) and Paraguay with 85,490 MT (10%). Use as a beverage Steaming mate infusion in a cup that resembles a gourd, the customary vessel The infusion, called mate in Spanish-speaking countries or in Brazil, is prepared by filling a container, traditionally a small, hollowed-out gourd, up to three-quarters full with dry leaves (and twigs) of I. paraguariensis, and filling it up with water at a temperature of , hot but not boiling. Sugar may or may not be added. The infusion may also be prepared with cold water, in which case it is known as .How to make mate Drinking mate is a common social practice in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, and southern Brazil among people of all ages, and is often a communal ritual following customary rules. Friends and family members share from the same container, traditionally a hollow gourd (also called a , , or simply in Spanish, a or in Portuguese, or a in Italian), and drink through the same wooden or metal straw (a in Spanish or in Portuguese). The gourd is given by the brewer to each person, often in a circle, in turn; the recipient gives thanks, drinks the few mouthfuls in the container, and then returns the mate to the brewer, who refills it and passes it to the next person in clockwise order. Although traditionally made from a hollowed calabash gourd, these days mate \\"gourds\\" are produced from a variety of materials including wood, glass, bull horns, ceramic, and silicone.Guide to Yerba Mate Gourds In the same way as people meet for tea or coffee, friends often gather and drink mate () in Paraguay, Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay. In warm weather the hot water is sometimes replaced by lemonade. Paraguayans typically drink yerba mate with cold water during hot days and hot water in the morning and during cooler temperatures. Selection of yerba mate gourds and bombillas at a street vendor in Buenos Aires, Argentina Yerba mate is most popular in Paraguay and Uruguay, where people are seen walking the streets carrying the and often a (thermal vacuum flask) in their arms.

Retrieved 30 May 2013 The amount of herb used to prepare the infusion is much greater than that used for tea and other beverages, which accounts for the large weights. Yerba mate shop, Puerto Iguazu, Argentina The flavor of brewed mate resembles an infusion of vegetables, herbs, and grass and is reminiscent of some varieties of green tea. Some consider the flavor to be very agreeable, but it is generally bitter if steeped in hot water. Sweetened and flavored mate is also sold, in which the mate leaves are blended with other herbs (such as peppermint) or citrus rind. In Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina, a version of mate known as (or just mate or cocido) in Paraguay and in Brazil is sold in teabags and in a loose leaf form. It is often served sweetened in specialized shops or on the street, either hot or iced, pure or with fruit juice (especially lime, known in Brazil as ) or milk. In Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil, this is commonly consumed for breakfast or in a caf√© for afternoon tea, often with a selection of sweet pastries (facturas). An iced, sweetened version of mate cocido is sold as an uncarbonated soft drink, with or without fruit flavoring. In Brazil, this cold version of is especially popular in the south and southeast regions, and can easily be found in retail stores in the same cooler as other soft drinks. , which is toasted, has less of a bitter flavor and more of a spicy fragrance. becomes creamy when shaken and is more popular in the coastal cities of Brazil, as opposed to the far southern states, where it is more commonly consumed in the traditional way (green, with a silver straw from a shared gourd), and called ( in Spanish, particularly Argentine Spanish). In Paraguay, western Brazil (Mato Grosso do Sul, west of S√£o Paulo and Paran√°), and the Argentine littoral, a mate infusion, called in Spanish and Portuguese or in Portuguese in southern Brazil, is also consumed as a cold or iced beverage, usually sucked out of a horn cup called a with a . can be prepared with cold water (the most common way in Paraguay and Brazil) or fruit juice (the most common way in Argentina). The version with water is more bitter; fruit juice acts as a sweetener (in Brazil, this is usually avoided with the addition of table sugar). Medicinal or culinary herbs, known as (weeds), may be crushed with a pestle and mortar and added to the water for taste or medicinal reasons. Yerba for sale in the open-air market of La Boqueria in Barcelona, Spain Paraguayans have a tradition of mixing mate with crushed leaves, stems, and flowers of the plant known as (the flower of August, plants of the genus Senecio, particularly Senecio grisebachii), which contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Modifying mate in this fashion is potentially toxic, as these alkaloids can cause veno-occlusive disease, a rare condition of the liver which results in liver failure due to progressive occlusion of the small venous channels. Mate has also become popular outside of South America. In the tiny hamlet of Groot Marico, North West Province, South Africa, mate was introduced to the local tourism office by the returning descendants of the Boers, who in 1902 had emigrated to Patagonia in Argentina after losing the Anglo Boer War. It is also commonly consumed in Lebanon, Syria, and some other parts of the Middle East, mainly by Druze and Alawite people. Most of its popularity outside South America is a result of historical emigration to South America and subsequent return. It is consumed worldwide by expatriates from the Southern Cone. Materva is a sweet, carbonated soft drink based on yerba mate. Developed in Cuba in 1920, and produced since the 1960s in Miami, Florida, it is a staple of the Cuban culture in Miami. Use as a health food Mate is often consumed as a health food. Packages of yerba mate are available in health food stores and are frequently stocked in large supermarkets in Europe, Australia, and the United States. By 2013, Asian interest in the drink had seen significant growth that led to significant exports to those countries. =Chemical composition and properties= Yerba mate contains a variety of polyphenols such as the flavonoids quercetin and rutin. Yerba mate contains three xanthines: caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline, the main one being caffeine. Caffeine content varies between 0.7% and 1.7% of dry weightDellacassa, Cesio et al. Departamento de Farmacognosia, Facultad de Qu√≠mica, Universidad de la Rep√∫blica, Uruguay, Noviembre: 2007, pages 1‚Äì15 (compared with 0.4‚Äì9.3% for tea leaves, 2.5‚Äì7.6% in guarana, and up to 3.2% for ground coffee); theobromine content varies from 0.3% to 0.9%; theophylline is typically present only in small quantities or sometimes completely absent. A substance previously called \\"mateine\\" is a synonym for caffeine (like theine and guaranine). Yerba mate also contains elements such as potassium, magnesium, and manganese. =Health effects= Yerba mate has been claimed to have various effects on human health, most of which have been attributed to the high quantity of polyphenols found in the beverage. Research has found that yerba mate may improve allergy symptoms and reduce the risk of diabetes mellitus and high blood sugar in mice. Mate also contains compounds that may act as an appetite suppressant and possible weight loss tool, increases mental energy and focus, improves mood, and promotes deeper sleep; however, sleep may be negatively affected in people who are sensitive to caffeine. Before 2011, there were no double-blind, randomized prospective clinical trials of yerba mate consumption with respect to chronic disease. Many studies have been conducted since then, pointing to at least some probable health benefits of yerba mate, such as reduction of fat cells, inflammation, and cholesterol, although more research is needed. Some non- blinded studies have found mate consumption to be effective in lipid lowering. Another study determined that mate reduces progression of arteriosclerosis in rabbits but did not decrease serum cholesterol or aortic TBARS and antioxidant enzymes. =Weight loss= Yerba mate contains polyphenols such as flavonoids and phenolic acids, which work by inhibiting enzymes like pancreatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase, which in turn play a role in fat metabolism. Yerba mate has been shown to increase satiety by slowing gastric emptying. Effects on weight loss may be due to reduced absorption of dietary fats and/or altered cholesterol metabolism. Despite yerba mate's potential for reducing body weight, there is minimal data on the effects of yerba mate on body weight in humans. Therefore, yerba mate should not be recommended over diet and physical exercise without further study on its effects. =Cancer= The consumption of hot mate tea is associated with oral cancer, esophageal cancer, cancer of the larynx, and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck. Studies show a correlation between tea temperature and likelihood of cancer, making it unclear how much of a role mate itself plays as a carcinogen. =E-NTPDase activity= Research also shows that mate preparations can alter the concentration of members of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase) family, resulting in elevated levels of extracellular ATP, ADP, and AMP. This was found with chronic ingestion (15 days) of an aqueous mate extract, and may lead to a novel mechanism for manipulation of vascular regenerative factors, i.e. treating heart disease. =Antioxidants= In an investigation of mate antioxidant activity, there was a correlation found between content of caffeoyl-derivatives and antioxidant capacity (AOC). Amongst a group of Ilex species, the antioxidant activity of Ilex paraguariensis was the highest. =Monoamine oxidase inhibition activity= A study from the University of S√£o Paulo cites yerba mate extract as an inhibitor of MAO activity; the maximal inhibition observed in vitro was 40‚Äì50%. A monoamine oxidase inhibitor is a type of antidepressant, so there is some data to suggest that yerba mate has a calming effect in this regard.http://www.globalsciencebooks.info/Online/GSBOnline/images/0706/MAPSB_1(1)/MAPSB_1(1)37-46o.pdf (Page 43) See also * Black drink * Club-Mate * Matte Le√£o * Ilex guayusa, known as guayusa, another caffeine-containing holly species of the Ilex genus, native to the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest * Ilex vomitoria, a caffeine- containing species of the Ilex genus native to North America * Kuding, Ilex kudingcha * Materva, a mate soft drink * Nativa * Guayaki, a brand of drinks based out of California References Category:Ilex Category:Flora of Argentina Category:Flora of Brazil Category:Trees of Brazil Category:Flora of Paraguay Category:Flora of Uruguay Category:Flora of Atlantic Forest (biome) Category:Flora of the Cerrado Category:Latin American cuisine Category:Caffeine Category:Herbal and fungal stimulants Category:Herbal tea Category:Medicinal plants Category:Crops originating from the Americas Category:Crops originating from Brazil Category:Crops originating from Argentina Category:Crops originating from Uruguay Category:Crops originating from Paraguay Category:Near threatened plants Category:Agriculture in Brazil Category:Agriculture in Argentina Category:Agriculture in Paraguay ","title":"Yerba mate"},{"id":"165470","text":"Kalimantan is the Indonesian portion of the island of Borneo. It comprises 73% of the island's area. The non-Indonesian parts of Borneo are Brunei and East Malaysia. In Indonesia, \\"Kalimantan\\" refers to the whole island of Borneo. In 2019, the Indonesian President Joko Widodo proposed that Indonesia's capital be moved to Kalimantan. Etymology The name Kalimantan, which is often spelled Klemantan, was derived from the Sanskrit word Kalamanthana, which means \\"burning weather island\\", or island with a very hot temperature, to describe its hot and humid tropical climate. It consists of the two words kal[a] (\\"time, season, period\\") and manthan[a] (\\"boiling, churning, burning\\"). The indigenous people of the eastern region of Borneo referred to their island by the term Pulu K'lemantan or \\"Kalimantan\\" by the time the Portuguese explorer Jorge de Menezes made contact with them. Its association with the island and its peoples has also been attributed to British scientist and colonial administrator Charles Hose from the early 20th century. However, the use of this term to refer to a supposed Klemantan people has since been discontinued, as it has been deemed to be an invented term of convenience that does not properly represent the people it claims to describe.

The language is spoken by the Acadian Francophone population of the Canadian province of New Brunswick, by small minorities on the Gasp√© Peninsula and the Magdalen Islands of Quebec as well as in pockets of Francophones in Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. In the United States, it is spoken in the Saint John Valley of northern Aroostook County, Maine. Besides standard French, New England French is the predominant form of French spoken elsewhere in Maine. Phonology Since there was relatively little linguistic contact with France from the late 18th century to the 20th century, Acadian French retained features that died out during the French standardization efforts of the 19th century such as these: * The phoneme, Acadian French has retained an alveolar trill or an alveolar flap, but modern speakers pronounced it as in Parisian French: (red) can be pronounced , or . * In nonstandard Acadian French, the third-person plural ending of verbs ‚Äπ‚Ä∫, such as (they eat), is still pronounced, unlike standard French (France and Quebec) ( (France)/ or (Quebec)), the ‚Äπe‚Ä∫ can be pronounced or not, but ‚Äπ-nt‚Ä∫ is always silent.

Accessed 5 May 2011. some characteristics of Acadian are: *The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural *Palatalization of and to and , respectively *A featured called \\"l'ouisme\\" where bonne is pronounced These features typically occur in older speech. Many aspects of Acadian French (vocabulary and \\"trill r\\", etc.) are still common in rural areas in the South West of France. Speakers of Metropolitan French and even of other Canadian varieties of French sometimes have difficulty understanding Acadian French. Within North America, its closest relative is the Cajun French spoken in Southern Louisiana since both were born out of the same population that were affected during the Expulsion of the Acadians. See also Chiac, a variety with strong English influence, and St. Marys Bay French, a distinct variety of Acadian French spoken around Clare, Tusket, Nova Scotia and also Moncton, New Brunswick. =Affrication= * and is commonly replaced by before a front vowel.

A combined force of Poles and Moravians under the command of the duke Henry II the Pious of Silesia, supported by feudal nobility and a few knights from military orders sent by the Pope, attempted to halt the Mongol invasion of Europe. The battle came two days before the Mongol victory over the Hungarians at the much larger Battle of Mohi. Historical disputations As with many historical battles, the exact details of force composition, tactics, and the actual course of the battle are lacking and sometimes contradictory. The general historical view is that it was a crushing defeat for the Polish and Moravian forces where they suffered heavy casualties. It is known that the Mongols had no intentions at the time of extending the campaign westward, because they went to the Kingdom of Hungary to help the main Mongol army in the conquest of the country. One of the Mongol leaders, Kadan, was frequently confused with √ñgedei's grandson Kaidu by medieval chroniclers, and thus Kaidu has often been mistakenly listed as leading the Mongol forces at Legnica.James Chambers. The Devil's Horsemen: The Mongol Invasion of Europe. Atheneum. New York. 1979. Background The Mongols considered the Cumans to have submitted to their authority, but the Cumans fled westward and sought asylum within the Kingdom of Hungary. After King B√©la IV of Hungary rejected Batu Khan's ultimatum to surrender the Cumans, Subutai began planning the Mongol invasion of Europe. Batu and Subutai were to lead two armies to attack Hungary itself, while a third under Baidar, Orda Khan and Kadan would attack Poland as a diversion to occupy northern European forces which might come to Hungary's aid. Orda's forces devastated northern Poland and the southwestern border of Lithuania. Baidar and Kadan ravaged the southern part of Poland: first they sacked Sandomierz; then on 3 March they defeated a Polish army in the battle of Tursko; then on 18 March they defeated another Polish army at Chmielnik; on 24 March they seized and burned Krak√≥w, and a few days later they tried unsuccessfully to capture the Silesian capital of Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau). While deciding whether or not to besiege Wroc≈Çaw, Baidar and Kadan received reports that King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia was two days away with an army over twiceChambers, p. 99 the size of Henry's. The Mongols turned from Wroc≈Çaw to intercept Henry's forces before the European armies could meet. The Mongols caught up with Henry near Legnica at Legnickie Pole (Polish for \\"Field of Legnica\\"), also known as Wahlstatt. Composition=Mongols= The Mongol heavy cavalry in battle (13th or 14th century). The Mongol diversionary force, a detachment (no less than one and no more than two tumens) from the army of Subutai, demonstrated the advantages of the tactical mobility and speed of horseback archers. The Mongol tactics were essentially a long series of feigned attacks and faked withdrawals from widely dispersed groups, which were designed to inflict a constant slow drain by ranged fire, disrupt the enemy formation and draw larger numbers away from the main body into ambush and flank attacks. These were standard Mongol tactics used in virtually all of their major battles; they were made possible by continual training and superb battlefield communication, which used a system of flags. The Mongol commander found the highest ground at the battle site, seized it and used it to communicate to his noyans and lesser commanders their orders for troop movement. The Mongol system was a stark contrast to the European systems, in which knights advanced with basically no communication with supporting forces. The numbers involved are difficult to judge. European accounts vary as to Mongol numbers‚Äîsome suggest more than 100,000 at Legnica alone. These are gross overestimates, given that this number is far larger than the entire Mongol force in all of Europe, as well as not taking into account the weaknesses of 13th-century Mongol logistical support in Western Eurasia. Current estimates suggest the Mongol force numbered, at most, 25,000 cavalry. The Historia Tatarorum by the Franciscan C. de Bridia Monachi suggests a Mongol force of 10,000 troops, which would have been reduced to around 8,000 after casualties suffered earlier in the campaign, at the Battle of Chmielnik, Battle of Tursko, and the Battle of Tarczek. A contemporary European account, the Ystoria Mongalorum, supports these numbers, placing the Mongol force that invaded Poland at 10,000 horsemen. =Polish states and allies= According to James Chambers, Henry's force numbered at most 25,000 troops, most likely less, and had a large number of untrained and poorly equipped men, sometimes with no weapons other than the tools of their trade.Chambers, p. 97 Lesser trained forces included an army from Opole under Duke Mieszko II the Fat; Moravians led by Boleslav, son of the Margrave of Moravia Dƒõpolt III; conscripts from Greater Poland; and volunteer Bavarian miners from not long before established town of Goldberg (Z≈Çotoryja). Henry's better trained troops were his own gathered in his Silesian realm, mercenaries, and very small contingents of French Knights Templar and other foreign volunteers. Historian Marek Cetwi≈Ñski estimates the allied force to have been 2,000 strong, while Gerard Labuda estimates 7,000‚Äì8,000 soldiers in the Christian army. A contingent of Teutonic Knights of indeterminate number is traditionally believed to have joined the allied army. However, recent analysis of the 15th- century Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz by Labuda suggests that the German crusaders may have been added to the text after chronicler D≈Çugosz had completed the work. A legend that the Prussian Landmeister of the Teutonic Knights, Poppo von Osterna, was killed during the battle is false, as he died at Legnica years later while visiting his wife's nunnery.William Urban.

The Hospitallers have also been said to have participated in this battle, but this too seems to be a fabrication added in later accounts; neither Jan D≈Çugosz's accounts nor the letter sent to the King of France from the Templar Grand Master Ponce d'Aubon mention them.Burzy≈Ñski, p.22 Peter Jackson further points out that the only military order that fought at Legnica was the Templars.Jackson, p. 205 The Templar contribution was very small, estimated around 68‚Äì88 well-trained, well-armed soldiers;Burzy≈Ñski, p. 24 their letter to the king of France gives their losses as three brother knights, two sergeants and 500 'men'‚Äîaccording to their use of the term, probably peasants working their estates and thus neither better armed or trained than the rest of the army's infantry. The battle Henry II of Silesia was killed in the Battle of Legnica. Henry divided his forces into four sections: the Bavarian miners led by Boleslav of Moravia; the conscripts from Greater Poland along with some Cracovians led by Sulis≈Çaw, the brother of the killed palatine of Krak√≥w; the army of Opole under Mieszko; and, under Henry's personal command, the Silesians, Moravians, and Templars. According to Chambers' description of the battle, the Silesian cavalry initiated combat with the vanguard (mangudai) of the Mongol army. After the Silesians were repelled, the cavalry of Greater Poland, led by Sulis≈Çaw, and the cavalry of Opole then attacked the Mongols. The Mongol vanguard retreated, inducing the allied cavalry to pursue, thereby separating them from the Polish infantry. Although the mangudai fled, Mongol light cavalry flanked the Polish forces. A smokescreen was used to hide the Mongol movements and confuse the Europeans. While the Mongol light cavalry attacked from the flanks and the heavy cavalry attacked from the front, Mongol archers peppered the Polish forces with arrows. Erik Hildinger indicates that the levies of Boleslav led the attack, instead of the Silesians. He adds that after the Polish cavalry began their pursuit during the Mongols' feigned retreat, a rider shouted \\"Run! Run!\\" (in Polish) to the Polish forces, confusing Mieszko, who ordered his Opole contingent to retreat from the battle. This withdrawal led Henry to order his own reserves and cavalry into the fight.Erik Hildinger. \\"Mongol Invasions: Battle of Liegnitz\\". TheHistoryNet.com, originally published Military History magazine, June 1997. Accessed 2 September 2008. The Mongols had much success in the battle by feigning their retreat. After the Polish knights detached from the main body of allied forces in pursuit of the fleeing Mongols, the invaders were able to separate the knights from the infantry and defeat them one by one. The Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz also describes the battle, although it was written in the 15th century, not when it actually occurred. The army of Henry II was almost destroyed‚ÄîHenry and Boleslav of Moravia were killed and estimates of casualties range from 2,000 to 40,000, essentially the entire army. The Templar Grand Master Ponce d'Aubon reported to King Louis IX of France that the military order lost 500 people, both in Legnica and subsequent raids on three Templar villages and two \\"towers\\"John Man ‚Äì Genghis Khan, p.298 among them nine brothers, three knights, and two sergeants. This number likely included civilians of the villages. Mongol casualties are unknown; a perfect execution of their standard tactics would have minimized losses, but the Mongols endured sufficient casualties to dissuade them from attacking the Bohemian army. The Mongols cut the right ear off of each fallen European in order to count the dead; supposedly they filled nine sackfuls, though this has as much validity as European accounts of the numbers of Mongols.Davies, Norman. Europe: A History. HarperCollins. New York. 1998. Henry was struck down and beheaded while attempting to flee the battlefield with three bodyguards, and the Mongols paraded his head on a spear before the town of Legnica. Conclusion A scene from an altar of St. Hedwig of Silesia: Mongol warriors display the head of Henry II of Silesia on a long lance in an attempt to weaken the morale of the defenders. Painting of 1430. Wenceslaus I of Bohemia, who had been a day's march away, fell back to gather reinforcements from Thuringia and Saxony upon learning of the defeat. He was overtaken by the Mongol vanguard at K≈Çodzko. However, his force was far larger and more powerful than the host at Legnica, and the Mongol detachment was routed by the Bohemian cavalry. As Baidar and Kadan's orders had been to serve as a diversion, they stayed to keep the Bohemian forces tied up, avoiding confrontation with the larger army while splitting up into bands and sacking minor towns and villages. Eventually, they turned away from Bohemia and Poland and headed southward to join Batu and Subutai, who had defeated the Hungarians at the Battle of Mohi. After Batu Khan returned from Mongolia, his relations with his cousins were so poor that not until the election of M√∂ngke Khan as Khagan did he again consider turning westward to Europe. However, he died in 1255 before those plans could be put into motion. Under the rule of his brother Berke, the Golden Horde was preoccupied with the conflict with their cousins in the Ilkhanate, led by Hulagu Khan, whom Berke Khan despised for the Battle of Baghdad and the murder of Caliph Al-Musta'sim. Larger invasions of Poland, devoted primarily to looting, would be launched later. Led by Burundai, the Mongols successfully raided Poland in 1259‚Äì1260. They raided again under the leadership of Tulabuga and Nogai Khan, accompanied by vassal troops from Ruthenia, successfully in 1286 and unsuccessfully in 1287. Although the Mongols repeatedly expressed desire to conquer central Europe in ultimatums up to the 1270s, Poland and Hungary stayed outside of the Golden Horde's sphere of influence. The Russian lands to their east remained under the rule of the Golden Horde for the next two centuries. The Battle of Legnica is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"LEGNICA 9 IV 1241\\".

It has been ranked the top undergraduate university in the country 21 times in the past 29 years by Maclean's magazine, a record unmatched by any other university. With a 17:1 student-to-faculty ratio, the average first-year class size is 60 and upper-year classes average 14 students. Mount Allison University was the first university in the British Empire to award a baccalaureate to a woman (Grace Annie Lockhart, B.Sc, 1875). Mount Allison graduates have been awarded a total of 55 Rhodes Scholarships. American chemist James B. Sumner, who won the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, worked at Mount Allison as a teaching fellow in 1910-11. Mount Allison also has one of the largest endowments per student in Canada.  History  Mount Allison University is a secular (but United Church-affiliated) primarily undergraduate liberal arts university, established at Sackville, New Brunswick on January 19, 1843. The university was named after Charles Frederick Allison, in honour of his gift of land and money. Its origins were steeped in the Methodist faith and it was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members. The university was chartered on April 14, 1849. In June 1839, Charles Allison was encouraged by Wesleyan Methodist Minister Rev. John Bass Strong that a school of elementary and higher learning be built. Allison offered to purchase a site in Sackville to erect a suitable building for an academy and to contribute operating funds of ¬£100 a year for 10 years. This offer was accepted and the Wesleyan Academy for boys subsequently opened in 1843.John G. Reid, \\"ALLISON, CHARLES FREDERICK,\\" in EN:UNDEF:public_citation_publication, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed January 27, 2015, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/allison_charles_frederick_8E.html.The Project Gutenberg EBook #6466 of 'The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People, A historical review' by John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, February 17th, 1881 Previous Chancellor, Peter Mansbridge In 1854, a girls' institution (later known as the \\"Ladies College\\") was opened to complement the boys' academy. In 1858 an Act of the New Brunswick Legislature authorized the trustees to establish a degree-conferring institution at Sackville, under the name of the Mount Allison Wesleyan College. In July 1862, the degree-granting Mount Allison College was organized. The first two students, Howard Sprague and Josiah Wood, graduated in May 1863. Mount Allison was the first university in the British Empire to confer a bachelor's degree to a woman (Grace Annie Lockhart, B.Sc. 1875). It was also the first university in Canada to grant a bachelor of arts to a woman (Harriet Starr Stewart).Semple, N. (1996). The Lord's Dominion: The History of Canadian Methodism. McGill-Queen's Press, p. 253. For nearly a century, Mount Allison functioned as three distinct, mutually enriching parts: the college proper, the Boys' Academy, and the Ladies College. The corporate name was changed to University of Mount Allison College in 1886. The university's affiliation was transferred to the United Church of Canada following church union in 1925. Original components of the university included: the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy for Boys (1840‚Äì1958), the Ladies' College (1854‚Äì1958), and Mount Allison College. Mount Allison College was established in 1862 with degree-granting powers on behalf of the other two. Sackville's incorporation and its founding peoples. It was installed on the campus of Mount Allison University in 2003. The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. By 1920, Mount Allison University had three faculties: Arts, Theology, and Engineering. It awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Divinity (BD), and Master of Arts. It had 246 male students and 73 female students, as well as 28 academic staff, all male.Dominion Bureau of Statistics, Canada Year Book 1921, Ottawa, 1922 The closure of the School for Girls in 1946 and the Boy's Academy in 1953 coincided with a period of expansion and provided much-needed space for the growing university. In 1958, a period of construction and acquisition of buildings began, easing the strain of overcrowding at the institution. At this time the university board and administration decided to reaffirm the traditional aims of Mount Allison in providing a high-quality undergraduate liberal arts education, along with continuing to offer professional programs in already-established fields. As such, the university decided not to compete for new professional programs and generally avoided post-graduate course development. The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. Mount Allison University was established by the Mount Allison University Act, 1993.Mount Allison University Act Mount Allison University's arms and badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on November 15, 2007.  Academics  The mission statement of Mount Allison University promotes \\"the creation and dissemination of knowledge in a community of higher learning, centred on the undergraduate student and delivered in an intimate and harmonious environment\\". Mount Allison currently offers bachelor's degrees in Arts, Science, Commerce, Fine Arts, and Music, as well as master's degrees in biology and chemistry and biochemistry, and certificates in bilingualism. A Bachelor's degree in Science with a major in Aviation has been developed in conjunction with the Moncton Flight College. Mount Allison has one of the best records of Rhodes Scholars per capita in Canada ‚Äî 55 all together, and 14 in the past 16 years. In 2014, 76 per cent of the student body received an entrance scholarship. The University's enrolment is approximately 2,300 students. = Faculties, departments, and programs = (Alex) Colville House * Faculty of Arts (BA, BMus, BFA) ** Classics ** English ** Fine Arts ** History ** Modern Languages & Literatures ** Music ** Philosophy ** Psychology ** Religious Studies ** American Studies ** Canadian Studies ** Drama * Faculty of Social Sciences (BA, BComm) **Anthropology ** Commerce ** Economics ** Geography & Environment ** Politics & International Relations ** Sociology ** Environmental Studies ** PPE (Philosophy, Political Science, and Economics) * Faculty of Science (BSc, MSc) ** Biology ** Chemistry & Biochemistry ** Mathematics & Computer Science ** Physics ** Psychology ** Aviation (in conjunction with Moncton Flight College) ** Environmental Science ** Cognitive Science  Architecture  Mount Allison's architecture is one of the campus's defining features. In most cases, the present campus is much newer than the age of the institution, which was founded in the mid-19th century. At that time, the original Mount Allison buildings were wooden clapboarded structures all painted white. Succumbing to fires or demolition, these earlier buildings have been replaced with brick or stone structures, although a unique and significant instance of early Mount Allison wooden architecture survives at the centre of campus: the President's Cottage of 1857. Noted architectural historian, John Leroux, who is working with visual artist Thaddeus Holownia on a book about the University's architecture, calls the campus \\"one of the finest in Canada\\" The Record. and says some of the most beautiful buildings built in New Brunswick in the last 100 years are located at Mount Allison. In particular, Leroux names the Mount Allison chapel as one of the most significant buildings in the province, saying, \\"It is exquisite. It is nearly a perfect building.\\" The Chapel is a masterwork of the Ontario-based architecture firm of Brown, Brisley and Brown, who designed numerous new buildings and transformed the site configuration of Mount Allison in the mid- to late-1960s and early 1970s into the landscape it is today. Paramount of their scheme was the creation of the central courtyard with the Chapel as a focus at one end, and the Library's gateway colonnade overlooking the town and Convocation Hall at the other. Among the other Brown, Brisley and Brown buildings completed at Mount Allison between 1964 and 1980 are: the Gairdner Fine Arts building, the Marjorie Young Bell Conservatory of Music, the Barclay Chemistry Building, Edwards House, Thornton House, the Ralph Pickard Bell Library, and the Harold Crabtree building. Owens Art Gallery Other significant buildings are the Owens Art Gallery, the oldest University art gallery in Canada, which opened in 1895, and Hammond House, the only registered National Historic Site in the Town of Sackville. Both were designed by noted Toronto architect Edmund Burke. The Queen Anne Revival-style Hammond House was originally built for Canadian artist and head of the Fine Arts department John Hammond in 1896. It now serves as the President's residence. Several campus buildings were designed by architect Andrew R. Cobb, including the Memorial Library (1926‚Äì27; demol. 2011), Flemington Building (1930‚Äì31), and Centennial Hall (1883‚Äì84, but redesigned by Cobb in 1933 after the original was gutted by fire). The Memorial Library (renamed University Centre in 1970) was constructed in the Tudor-inspired Gothic Revival style. The library also included a set of plaques, now located on the ground floor atrium of the Wallace McCain Student Centre, which are listed in the Canadian Forces' National Inventory of Canadian Military Memorials ‚Äì No. 13002-004. The plaques list the names of Allisonians who lost their lives at war. Every year since 1927, the names of each of the fallen are read aloud during the University's annual Remembrance Day service. The Wallace McCain Student Centre, originally constructed as a men's residence (Trueman House) in 1945 and designed by Halifax architect C.A. Fowler, was gutted and repurposed in 2008, keeping the exterior form and stone walls intact. The newest building on campus is the Purdy Crawford Centre for the Arts, which opened in 2014. Housing the Department of Fine Arts and the drama program, the building features art studios, a large atrium, and the 100-seat Motyer-Fancy Theatre. Designed by the internationally honoured Canadian architecture firm Zeidler Partnership, it was featured in Canadian Architect magazine in March 2015.  Housing  One of the single rooms at Campbell Hall Mount Allison has housing facilities available for approximately 50 percent of its student population. More than 85 percent of first-year students choose to live in residence. On- campus accommodations are guaranteed to all first-year students who meet admission and deposit deadlines. All rooms come with high speed wired as well as wireless Internet, as well as cable, phone, and mini fridge. All buildings are co-ed with wing to wing or integrated bathrooms. Sixty percent of rooms are either single or ensuite style and 40 percent are double accommodation. Campbell Hall, winner of CBIP Award for incorporation of environment features, offers large single rooms with ensuite bathrooms. In addition, Mount Allison also offers senior students a chance to live in one of two small residences (Carriage ‚Äì six rooms, Anchorage ‚Äì 11 rooms.) The following residences are open for new and returning students: * Campbell Hall * Harper Hall * Windsor Hall * Bigelow House * Bennett House * Hunton House * Thornton House * Edwards House  Social life  Social life at Mount Allison tends to focus on extracurricular activities: 140 clubs and societies and over 30 varsity, club, and intramural sports teams. Mount Allison students also socialize at places like Gracie's, The Pond (campus pub), Ducky's, Joey's, and the Bridge Street Caf√©. Mount Allison's campus paper, The Argosy, is an independent publication produced weekly. The publication dates from 1872, making it one of the oldest student publications in the country. The campus and community radio station, CHMA 106.9 FM, is owned and operated by the members of Attic Broadcasting Company Ltd., a non-profit organization with its offices on the university campus. Springtime in Sackville ‚Äì a view of Convocation Hall from the swan pond, Mount Allison University. Tintamarre theatre company was founded at Mount Allison by Professor Alex Fancy and produces a bilingual collective show each year, staged at the Motyer-Fancy Theatre and later presented at junior and senior high schools throughout the Maritime provinces. A performing arts series is held at Convocation Hall (one of the largest concert halls east of Montreal) during the school year, and the annual President's Speakers Series brings nationally and internationally renowned speakers to campus each year. Fine Art students run START Gallery within Struts Gallery, a CARFAC artist-run center.  Student government  The Mount Allison Students‚Äô Union (MASU) represents all full- and part-time students at Mount Allison. It operates as a membership-based non-profit corporation, and was incorporated in 1980 under the New Brunswick Companies Act.  Administration  Mount Allison University 107726820RR0001 was registered as a charitable organization in Canada on January 1, 1967. The primary areas in which the charity is now carrying on programs to achieve its charitable purposes, ranked according to the percentage of time and resources devoted to each program area follow: * Universities and colleges 97% * Scholarships, bursaries, awards 3% The charity carried on charitable programs to further its charitable purpose(s) (as defined in its governing documents) this fiscal period: * Provides rigorous liberal education primarily to undergraduate students in a co-educational intimate residential environment. * Provides scholarships, bursaries and awards to students.  Notable alumni  Athletics  The school's team name in Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) is the Mount Allison Mounties. The football team has appeared in the Vanier Cup national college football championship game twice (1984 & 1991). The Mount Allison football team also made playoff appearances in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2014. The team won the 2013 AUS championship, but lost to the Laval Rouge et Or in the Uteck Bowl (the national college football semi final) and in 2014, losing to McMaster in the Mitchell Bowl. Mount Allison is also home to a CIS-level women's hockey team, as well as swim, badminton, and soccer teams. Basketball and volleyball teams compete against colleges and other smaller universities. Mount Allison is the winner of the first ever ACAA men's rugby championship in 2007 and remained undefeated through 2010, resulting in four consecutive championships. In both 2008 and 2009 the men's and women's Mounties remained undefeated throughout the regular season and became ACAA champions. The university women's hockey team plays at the Tantramar Civic Centre.  Labour relations  Mount Allison faculty are represented by the Mount Allison Faculty Association, and the staff by CUPE 3433 and CUPE 2338. Mount Allison had a three-week long faculty strike in early 2014. After this strike, students sought a refund for tuition, a request that was denied by the Board of Regents. Mount Allison had another week long faculty strike in early 2020, lasting from 03/02/2020 until 08/02/2020.

Victims who disappeared in these clandestine actions were never heard from again. Name The alliterative hendiadys Nacht und Nebel (German for \\"Night and Fog\\") is documented in German since the beginning of the 17th century.Grimmsches W√∂rterbuchhttp://woerterbuchnetz.de/cgi- bin/WBNetz/wbgui_py?sigle=DWB&mode;=Vernetzung&lemid;=GN01211#XGN01211 It was used by Wagner in Das Rheingold (1869) and has since been adopted into everyday German (e.g. it appears in Thomas Mann's Der Zauberberg). It is not clear whether the term Nacht-und-Nebel-Erlass (\\"Night and Fog directive\\") had been in wide circulation or used publicly before 1945. The designation \\"NN\\" was sometimes used, however, to refer to prisoners and deportees (\\"NN- Gefangener\\", \\"NN-H√§ftling\\", \\"NN-Sache\\") at the time. The abbreviation \\"NN\\" was otherwise well known in German to mean \\"nullus nomen\\" (\\"without name\\" for security reasons), similar to the English NN for \\"nomen nescio\\". Background Heinrich Himmler issued orders for Nacht und Nebel in 1941. Even before the Holocaust gained momentum, the Nazis had begun rounding up political prisoners from both Germany and occupied Europe. Most of the early prisoners were of two sorts: they were either political prisoners of personal conviction or belief whom the Nazis deemed in need of \\"re-education\\" to Nazi ideals, or resistance leaders in occupied western Europe.Spielvogel (1992). Hitler and Nazi Germany: A History, pp. 82‚Äì120, pp. 232‚Äì264. Up until the time of the Nacht und Nebel decree, prisoners from Western Europe were handled by German soldiers in approximately the same way as by other countries: according to international agreements and procedures such as the Geneva Convention.D√ºlffer (2009). Nazi Germany 1933‚Äì1945: Faith and Annihilation, pp. 160‚Äì163. Hitler and his upper level staff, however, made a critical decision not to conform to what they considered unnecessary rules and in the process abandoned \\"all chivalry towards the opponent\\" and removed \\"every traditional restraint on warfare.\\"Walter G√∂rlitz, \\"Keitel, Jodl, and Warlimont,\\" cited in Barnett ed., (2003). Hitler's Generals, p. 152. On 7 December 1941, Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler issued the following instructions to the Gestapo: On 12 December, Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel issued a directive which explained Hitler's orders: Wilhelm Keitel expanded the repressive Nacht und Nebel program to countries under military occupation. Three months later Keitel further expanded on this principle in a February 1942 letter stating that any prisoners not executed within eight days were to be handed over to the Gestapo.N√ºrnberger Dokumente, PS-1733, NOKW-2579, NG-226. Cited in Bracher (1970). The German Dictatorship: The Origins, Structure, and Effects of National Socialism, p. 418. and The decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission, by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany, and vanished without a trace. In 1945, the abandoned Sicherheitsdienst (SD) records were found to include merely names and the initials \\"NN\\" (Nacht und Nebel); even the sites of graves were unrecorded. The Nazis even coined a new term for those who \\"vanished\\" in accordance with this decree; they were vernebelt‚Äî\\"transformed into mist\\".Conot (2000). Justice at Nuremberg, p. 300. To this day, it is not known how many people disappeared as a result of this order.Manchester (2003). The Arms of Krupp, 1587‚Äì1968, p. 519. The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that the disappearances committed as part of the Nacht und Nebel program were war crimes which violated both the Hague Conventions and customary international law. Himmler immediately communicated Keitel's directive to various SS stations and within six months the decree was sent to concentration camp commanders by Richard Gl√ºcks.Mayer (2012). Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?: The \\"Final Solution\\" in History, pp. 337-338. The Nacht und Nebel prisoners were mostly from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway. They were usually arrested in the middle of the night and quickly taken to prisons hundreds of kilometres away for questioning, eventually arriving at concentration camps such as Natzweiler, Esterwegen or Gross-Rosen, if they survived.Kogon (2006). The Theory and Practice of Hell: The German Concentration Camps and the System behind Them, pp. 204‚Äì205. Natzweiler concentration camp in particular, became an isolation camp for political prisoners from northern and western Europe under the decree's mandate.Overy (2006). The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia, p. 605. Up to 30 April 1944, at least 6,639 persons were captured under the Nacht und Nebel orders.Lothar Gruchmann: \\"Nacht- und Nebel-\\"Justiz... In: VfZ 29 (1981), S. 395. Some 340 of them may have been executed. The 1956 film Night and Fog, directed by Alain Resnais, uses the term to illustrate one aspect of the concentration camp system as it was transformed into a system of labour and death camps. Text of the decreesRationale The reasons for Nacht und Nebel were many. The policy, enforced in Nazi-occupied countries, meant that whenever someone was arrested, the family would learn nothing about the person's fate. The people arrested, sometimes only suspected resisters, were secretly sent to Germany and perhaps to a concentration camp. Whether they lived or died, the Germans would give out no information to the families involved.Stackelberg (2007). The Routledge Companion to Nazi Germany, p. 286. This was done to keep the population in occupied countries quiet by promoting an atmosphere of mystery, fear and terror.Crankshaw, Edward (1990) [1956]. Gestapo: Instrument of Tyranny, London: Greenhill Books. p. 204.Kaden & Nestler (1993). \\"Erlass Hitlers √ºber die Verfolgung von Strafteten gegen das Reich, 7 December 1941.\\" Dokumente des Verbrechens: Aus den Akten des Dritten Reiches, vol i, pp. 162‚Äì163. The program made it far more difficult for other governments or humanitarian organizations to accuse the German government of specific misconduct because it obscured whether or not internment or death had even occurred, let alone the cause of the person's disappearance. It thereby kept the Nazis from being held accountable. It allowed across-the-board, silent defiance of international treaties and conventions ‚Äì one cannot apply the requirements for humane treatment in war if one cannot locate a victim or discern that victim's fate. Additionally, the policy lessened German subjects' moral qualms about the Nazi regime, as well as their desire to speak out against it, by keeping the general public ignorant of the regime's malfeasance and by creating extreme pressure for service members to remain silent.Kammer & Bartsch (1999). \\"Nacht und Nebel Erla√ü,\\" in Lexikon Nationalsozialismus: Begriffe, Organisationen und Institutionen, p. 160. Treatment of prisoners Replica of a Holocaust train boxcar used by Nazi Germany to transport Jews and other victims during the Holocaust. The Nacht und Nebel prisoners' hair was shaved and the women were given a convict costume of a thin cotton dress, wooden sandals and a triangular black headcloth. According to historian Wolfgang Sofsky, > Prisoners of the Nacht und Nebel transports were marked by broad red bands; > on their backs and both trouser legs was a cross, with the letters \\"NN\\" to > its right. From these emblems, it was possible to recognize immediately what > class a prisoner belonged to and how he or she was pigeonholed and evaluated > by the SS.Sofsky (1997). The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp, p. > 118. The prisoners were often moved apparently at random from prison to prison such as Fresnes Prison in Paris, Waldheim near Dresden, Leipzig, Potsdam, L√ºbeck and Stettin. The deportees were sometimes herded 80 at a time with standing room only into slow moving, dirty cattle wagons with little or no food or water on journeys lasting up to five days to their next unknown destination. At the camps, the prisoners were forced to stand for hours in freezing and wet conditions at 5:00am every morning, standing strictly to attention, before being sent to work a twelve-hour day with only a twenty-minute break for a scant meal. They were confined in cold and starving conditions; many had dysentery or other illnesses, and the weakest were often beaten to death, shot, guillotined, or hanged, while the others were subjected to torture by the Germans.Nichol, John and Rennell, Tony (2007). Escape from Nazi Europe, Penguin Books. When the inmates were totally exhausted or if they were too ill or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the Revier (Krankenrevier, sick barrack) or other places for extermination. If a camp did not have a gas chamber of its own, the so-called Muselm√§nner, or prisoners who were too sick to work, were often killed or transferred to other concentration camps for extermination. When the Allies liberated Paris and Brussels, the SS transported many of its remaining Nacht und Nebel prisoners to concentration camps deeper in Nazi-controlled territory, such as Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp for women, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, Buchenwald concentration camp, Schloss Hartheim, or Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp.

The body of Wilhelm Keitel after being hanged Early in the war, the program caused the mass execution of political prisoners, especially Soviet military prisoners, who in early 1942 outnumbered the Jews in number of deaths even at Auschwitz.Matth√§us (2004), \\"Operation Barbarossa and the Onset of the Holocaust, June ‚Äì December 1941,\\" in Browning & Matth√§us (2004).

As the transports grew and Hitler's troops moved across Europe, that ratio changed dramatically. The Nacht und Nebel decree was carried out surreptitiously, but it set the background for orders that would follow and established a \\"new dimension of fear\\".Taylor & Shaw (2002). \\"Nacht und Nebel,\\" in Dictionary of the Third Reich, p. 192. As the war continued, so did the openness of such decrees and orders. It can be surmised from various writings that in the beginning the German public knew only a little of the plans Hitler had to enforce a \\"New European Order\\". As the years passed, despite the best attempts of Goebbels and the Propaganda Ministry with its formidable domestic information control, diaries and periodicals of the time show that information about the harshness and cruelty of the program became progressively known to the German public.Gellately (2001). Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, pp. 51‚Äì69. Soldiers brought back information, families on rare occasion heard from or about loved ones, and Allied news sources and the BBC were able to get past censorship sporadically.Johnson (2006). What We Knew: Terror, Mass Murder, and Everyday Life in Nazi Germany, pp. 185‚Äì225. Although captured archives from the SD contain numerous orders stamped with \\"NN\\" (Nacht und Nebel), it has never been determined exactly how many people disappeared as a result of the decree. Hesitant if not outright skeptical at first of reports coming in about the atrocities being committed by the Nazis, the Allies' doubts were pushed aside when the French entered the Natzweiler- Struthof camp (one of the Nacht und Nebel facilities) on 23 November 1944, and discovered a chamber where victims were hung by their wrists from hooks to accommodate the process of pumping poisonous Zyklon-B gas into the room.Lowe (2012). Savage Continent: Europe in the Aftermath of World War II, p. 81. Keitel later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that of all the illegal orders he had carried out, the Nacht und Nebel decree was \\"the worst of all\\".Shirer (1990). The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p. 957. Former Supreme Court Justice and chief prosecutor at the international Nuremberg trial, Robert H. Jackson listed the \\"terrifying\\" Nacht und Nebel decree with the other crimes committed by the Nazis in his closing address.Marrus (1997). The Nuremberg War Crimes Trial, 1945‚Äì46: A Documentary History, p. 151. In part because of his role in carrying out this decree, Keitel was sentenced to death by hanging, despite his insistence on being shot instead due to his military service and rank.Conot (2000). Justice at Nuremberg, p. 501. At 1:20 a.m. on 16 October 1946 Keitel defiantly shouted out, \\"Alles f√ºr Deutschland! Deutschland √ºber alles!\\" just before the trap door opened beneath his feet.Conot (2000). Justice at Nuremberg, p. 506.

Afterword in The Walls Came Tumbling Down, to be published in 2021 by Scribe Publications. She is perhaps best known for her memoir The Walls Came Tumbling Down', about her return to the Netherlands from Germany after being released as a political prisoner at the end of the war. Published in 1957, in English, the book was an instant success in the United States, Great-Britain and the Netherlands. The American Hollywood actress Jan Sterling, a rising star at the time, called the book 'a female Bridge on the River Kwai' and bought the film rights.John L. Scott, 'Jan Sterling buys spy tale', Los Angeles Times, 25 May 1958, p. 1. The film was never made.  Start of resistance work  Born in The Hague to an upper- class family, Jet, as she was called by family and friends, was a graduate student at the University of Leiden at the start of World War II. During 1941, she became involved in the Dutch resistance. She started out by helping Jewish people flee or go into hiding. During 1942 and 1943, she collected information for the editors-in-chief of the influential Dutch resistance newspaper Het Parool (The Watchword). In 1943, she was recruited as a helper on an escape line running via Belgium, France and the Pyrenees to Spain, from where escapees could travel to London. It was set up at the instruction of the Dutch government in exile in London, with the aim to have people brought over to England to inform the government on the occupied homeland and the Dutch resistance. Dutch Secret agent Piet Gerbrands, trained in England, was dropped in the Netherlands in March 1943 to organize the line. He used the assistance of the resistance group Fiat Libertas, which already ran both an escape line for Allied air men shot down over the Netherlands and an intelligence line to Brussels. The escape line for the government was to be a separate line and was given the name St John, a codename of Gerbrands'. Jet, who spoke French fluently and could pass for a Belgian citizen, worked under the alias Gaby. She took her charges to Brussels, from where the Belgian guide ('passeur') Henri-Jean Nys assisted them to Toulouse. Secret agent Gerbrands was the first to return to London. However, the line St John only functioned briefly. The nazi counterintelligence agencies were able to disrupt the line by arresting various Dutch and Belgian helpers between the end of September and November 1943. Practically all of the members of resistance group Fiat Libertas were also arrested. Military espionage Jet, however, escaped arrest various times. When the government escape line was abandoned, she helped several allied airmen escape to Brussels. Her ability to rapidly cross the Dutch-Belgian border gained her the nickname Zip: she seemed to 'zip' to and fro. The Dutch Bureau of Intelligence in London, working for the Dutch government and responsible for sending secret agents such as Gerbrands, by now knew of Jets feats and capacities. The Bureau had for some time been eager to establish a line for military intelligence. The Allied High Command was preparing an invasion on the West coast of continental Europe and needed information about the military situation in various countries. Jet was traced in Brussels by a guide who asked her to travel to Bern, Switzerland, where a group of Dutch citizens worked to collect information and send it to the Dutch government. Jet set off for Switzerland at the end of December 1943. In Bern, she received instructions to organize a new resistance group in the Netherlands to collect military information and to set up a line via Paris, France, to Switzerland. But when she returned in January 1944, the nazi's were closing in on her. She had barely organised the intelligence line when she was caught on March 1, 1944, in Brussels, where she had traveled with intelligence for Switzerland. She was betrayed by an Belgian infiltrator who was later executed by the Belgian resistance. Trial and death sentence Jet was transferred to The Hague and interrogated severely and exhaustingly, but she managed to protect the new intelligence line and her coworkers. In July 1944, she and 19 other members of the former resistance group Fiat Libertas were moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, for their trial. Here, Jet again met up with Nel Lind, whom she had known previously as the organizer of the escape line for Allied pilots. She also met Joke Folmer for the first time. Joke (pronounced \\"Yo-kuh\\") had proven to be a competent and successful guide, who until her arrest in April 1944 had helped 320 people escape to Belgium. Half of them were Allied air men and many of them managed to return to England. Both women would become her companions until the end of the war and during their subsequent journey home. They figure prominently in \\"The Walls came tumbling down\\". The group were court-martialled by the German army on the charge of 'Feindbeg√ºnstigung', aiding and abetting the enemy, because their espionage activities and assistance to Allied pilots had undermined the interests of the German army, and had favoured enemy forces. Joke, Nel and Jet were sentenced to death; Jet even thrice, with the advise to absolutely carry out the sentence, since she was considered very dangerous. Escape from execution While their sentences were being considered for pardon, the Allied forces reached the Dutch border town of Breda at the beginning of September 1944. Many Nazis and Nazi sympathisers fled to Germany overnight; the military director of the prison in Utrecht was among them. He took the women who had been sentenced to death with him. The women were loaded into cattle wagons at the train station in Utrecht, but the procedural documents were left with the person who decided on pardons. It made them 'H√§ftlinge ohne Papiere', undocumented prisoners, which saved their lives. After several transfers they ended up in the German prison at Waldheim. By then they were Night and Fog prisoners, destined to disappear without a trace. They were oblivious to the fact that, in the growing chaos, confirmation of their death sentences was slowly catching up with them. They were liberated just in time. The American army was advancing from the West, but on May 6, 1945, the Soviet Army reached Waldheim and released the prisoners. Months after the end of the war, a large envelope surfaced in the Netherlands bearing the stamps of all their prisons, with dates just days after they had left.Interview with Joke Folmer, 2008, by Sonja van 't Hof. Waldheim prison At Waldheim, Henriette and the other prisoners were severely undernourished, and spent most of their free time embroidering bits of cloth with terse iconography about their experience. For instance, one section of Roosenburg's embroidery shows a crude drawing of a gun to indicate that the prisoners had heard what they thought was Allied gunfire, as well as the names \\"Nel\\" and \\"Joke\\" in Morse code to indicate that she was in solitary confinement, that Nell and Joke were in the two adjacent cells, and that they communicated by tapping Morse code on the walls. After their release, Henriette and four other Dutch NN prisoners (Dries, Nell, Joke, and Fafa, a Dutch NN prisoner with severe arthritis) had a chance to return to the Netherlands a few days later when the U.S. Army arrived with trucks to carry people through the Russian lines. However, Fafa's arthritis was so severe that she could not walk; and the surrounding roads were largely unpaved and rough. The other four did not believe that Fafa would survive the trip even if there were room for her cot‚Äîand there was not room for her cot; the truck was densely packed and offered standing room only. The group had heard that the Russians intended to send displaced persons back home via Odessa, a port in Ukraine on the Black Sea; considering that too far of a side trip, Dries, Nell, Joke, and Henriette stayed behind to take Fafa to a local civilian hospital instead, and then set out on their own for the Netherlands. The Russians had established sentries along major routes, including bridges, and were disallowing all unauthorized travel for fear German soldiers would escape along with former German POWs. Henriette and her friends, through bartering and guile, came to travel along Elbe River in a small boat from Waldheim to Coswig, where they were accosted by Russian soldiers and taken to a displaced persons camp populated by Belgians, Dutch, and Italians. On 6 June 1945 Roosenburg and a group of Dutch people were exchanged for a group of Russian POWs; they made their way to a Red Cross camp where they found that only the French and Belgians would be flying home; the rest would have to wait several weeks until a truck came. Roosenburg convinced a Dutch captain to give her group documentation stating that they were political prisoners and should have priority in transportation home; the paperwork she suggested did not mention their nationality, and so left them free to impersonate French or Belgian political prisoners. The next day Roosenburg and 15 other Dutch set out for Halle airfield, where they convinced an American soldier to allow them flight on the next plane to Belgium. Once in Belgium, the group set about calling friends and friends' friends to tell them they were alive and on their way home, and on 12 June they arrived at a monastery in the southern Netherlands where she and her friends were housed with between 1500 and 2000 others. The Netherlands had just been recently liberated and was suffering famine; as a result, trains to the north of the Netherlands only ran every three or four weeks. But Roosenburg happened to meet her cousin, Dirk Roosenburg, who had become a first lieutenant in the Dutch Army; he arranged for Henriette and her friends to be driven north the next day, where they reunited with their families. After the war, Henriette became a correspondent for Time Inc., serving in Paris and The Hague, and then New York City for a decade. At the beginning of her stay in New York, she wrote the book The Walls Came Tumbling Down about her experience traveling from Waldheim to the Netherlands, and was later awarded the Bronze Lion of the Netherlands. She died in 1972 at the age of 56.

It is an important concept in modern physics, and particularly theoretical physics. The concept of a \\"world line\\" is distinguished from concepts such as an \\"orbit\\" or a \\"trajectory\\" (e.g., a planet's orbit in space or the trajectory of a car on a road) by the time dimension, and typically encompasses a large area of spacetime wherein perceptually straight paths are recalculated to show their (relatively) more absolute position states‚Äîto reveal the nature of special relativity or gravitational interactions. The idea of world lines originates in physics and was pioneered by Hermann Minkowski. The term is now most often used in relativity theories (i.e., special relativity and general relativity). Usage in physics In physics, a world line of an object (approximated as a point in space, e.g., a particle or observer) is the sequence of spacetime events corresponding to the history of the object. A world line is a special type of curve in spacetime. Below an equivalent definition will be explained: A world line is a time-like curve in spacetime. Each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time. For example, the orbit of the Earth in space is approximately a circle, a three-dimensional (closed) curve in space: the Earth returns every year to the same point in space relative to the sun. However, it arrives there at a different (later) time. The world line of the Earth is helical in spacetime (a curve in a four-dimensional space) and does not return to the same point. Spacetime is the collection of points called events, together with a continuous and smooth coordinate system identifying the events. Each event can be labeled by four numbers: a time coordinate and three space coordinates; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space. The mathematical term for spacetime is a four-dimensional manifold. The concept may be applied as well to a higher-dimensional space. For easy visualizations of four dimensions, two space coordinates are often suppressed. The event is then represented by a point in a Minkowski diagram, which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate, say t, upwards and the space coordinate, say x horizontally. As expressed by F.R. Harvey :A curve M in [spacetime] is called a worldline of a particle if its tangent is future timelike at each point. The arclength parameter is called proper time and usually denoted œÑ. The length of M is called the proper time of the worldline or particle. If the worldline M is a line segment, then the particle is said to be in free fall. A world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime. A world sheet is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line (like a string) traveling through spacetime. The world sheet of an open string (with loose ends) is a strip; that of a closed string (a loop) resembles a tube. Once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume, it traces out not a world line but rather a world tube. World lines as a tool to describe events particles, strings, and branes. A one-dimensional line or curve can be represented by the coordinates as a function of one parameter. Each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line. So in mathematical terms a curve is defined by four coordinate functions x^a(\\\\tau),\\\\; a=0,1,2,3 (where x^{0} usually denotes the time coordinate) depending on one parameter \\\\tau. A coordinate grid in spacetime is the set of curves one obtains if three out of four coordinate functions are set to a constant. Sometimes, the term world line is loosely used for any curve in spacetime. This terminology causes confusions. More properly, a world line is a curve in spacetime that traces out the (time) history of a particle, observer or small object. One usually takes the proper time of an object or an observer as the curve parameter \\\\tau along the world line. =Trivial examples of spacetime curves= Three different world lines representing travel at different constant four- velocities. t is time and x distance. A curve that consists of a horizontal line segment (a line at constant coordinate time), may represent a rod in spacetime and would not be a world line in the proper sense. The parameter traces the length of the rod. A line at constant space coordinate (a vertical line in the convention adopted above) may represent a particle at rest (or a stationary observer). A tilted line represents a particle with a constant coordinate speed (constant change in space coordinate with increasing time coordinate). The more the line is tilted from the vertical, the larger the speed. Two world lines that start out separately and then intersect, signify a collision or \\"encounter\\". Two world lines starting at the same event in spacetime, each following its own path afterwards, may represent the decay of a particle into two others or the emission of one particle by another. World lines of a particle and an observer may be interconnected with the world line of a photon (the path of light) and form a diagram depicting the emission of a photon by a particle that is subsequently observed by the observer (or absorbed by another particle). =Tangent vector to a world line: four- velocity= The four coordinate functions x^a(\\\\tau),\\\\; a=0,1,2,3 defining a world line, are real functions of a real variable \\\\tau and can simply be differentiated in the usual calculus. Without the existence of a metric (this is important to realize) one can speak of the difference between a point p on the curve at the parameter value \\\\tau_0 and a point on the curve a little (parameter \\\\tau_0+\\\\Delta\\\\tau) farther away. In the limit \\\\Delta\\\\tau\\\\rightarrow 0, this difference divided by \\\\Delta\\\\tau defines a vector, the tangent vector of the world line at the point p. It is a four-dimensional vector, defined in the point p. It is associated with the normal 3-dimensional velocity of the object (but it is not the same) and therefore called four-velocity \\\\vec{v}, or in components: :\\\\vec{v} = (v^0,v^1,v^2,v^3) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{dx^0}{d\\\\tau}\\\\;,\\\\frac{dx^1}{d\\\\tau}\\\\;, \\\\frac{dx^2}{d\\\\tau}\\\\;, \\\\frac{dx^3}{d\\\\tau} \\\\right) where the derivatives are taken at the point p, so at \\\\tau=\\\\tau_0. All curves through point p have a tangent vector, not only world lines. The sum of two vectors is again a tangent vector to some other curve and the same holds for multiplying by a scalar. Therefore, all tangent vectors in a point p span a linear space, called the tangent space at point p. For example, taking a 2-dimensional space, like the (curved) surface of the Earth, its tangent space at a specific point would be the flat approximation of the curved space. World lines in special relativity So far a world line (and the concept of tangent vectors) has been described without a means of quantifying the interval between events. The basic mathematics is as follows: The theory of special relativity puts some constraints on possible world lines. In special relativity the description of spacetime is limited to special coordinate systems that do not accelerate (and so do not rotate either), called inertial coordinate systems. In such coordinate systems, the speed of light is a constant. The structure of spacetime is determined by a bilinear form Œ∑, which gives a real number for each pair of events. The bilinear form is sometimes called a spacetime metric, but since distinct events sometimes result in a zero value, unlike metrics in metric spaces of mathematics, the bilinear form is not a mathematical metric on spacetime. World lines of freely falling particles/objects are called geodesics. In special relativity these are straight lines in Minkowski space. Often the time units are chosen such that the speed of light is represented by lines at a fixed angle, usually at 45 degrees, forming a cone with the vertical (time) axis. In general, useful curves in spacetime can be of three types (the other types would be partly one, partly another type): * light-like curves, having at each point the speed of light. They form a cone in spacetime, dividing it into two parts. The cone is three-dimensional in spacetime, appears as a line in drawings with two dimensions suppressed, and as a cone in drawings with one spatial dimension suppressed. An example of a light cone, the three- dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in spacetime. Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed. The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the trajectory (\\"world line\\") of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the spacetime of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates. * time-like curves, with a speed less than the speed of light. These curves must fall within a cone defined by light-like curves. In our definition above: world lines are time-like curves in spacetime. * space- like curves falling outside the light cone. Such curves may describe, for example, the length of a physical object. The circumference of a cylinder and the length of a rod are space-like curves. At a given event on a world line, spacetime (Minkowski space) is divided into three parts. * The future of the given event is formed by all events that can be reached through time-like curves lying within the future light cone. * The past of the given event is formed by all events that can influence the event (that is, that can be connected by world lines within the past light cone to the given event). ** The lightcone at the given event is formed by all events that can be connected through light rays with the event. When we observe the sky at night, we basically see only the past light cone within the entire spacetime. * Elsewhere is the region between the two light cones. Points in an observer's elsewhere are inaccessible to her/him; only points in the past can send signals to the observer. In ordinary laboratory experience, using common units and methods of measurement, it may seem that we look at the present, but in fact there is always a delay time for light to propagate. For example, we see the Sun as it was about 8 minutes ago, not as it is \\"right now\\". Unlike the present in Galilean/Newtonian theory, the elsewhere is thick; it is not a 3-dimensional volume but is instead a 4-dimensional spacetime region. ** Included in \\"elsewhere\\" is the simultaneous hyperplane, which is defined for a given observer by a space that is hyperbolic-orthogonal to her/his world line. It is really three-dimensional, though it would be a 2-plane in the diagram because we had to throw away one dimension to make an intelligible picture. Although the light cones are the same for all observers at a given spacetime event, different observers, with differing velocities but coincident at the event (point) in the spacetime, have world lines that cross each other at an angle determined by their relative velocities, and thus they have different simultaneous hyperplanes. ** The present often means the single spacetime event being considered. =Simultaneous hyperplane= Since a world line w(\\\\tau) \\\\isin R^4 determines a velocity 4-vector v = \\\\frac {dw}{d\\\\tau} that is time-like, the Minkowski form \\\\eta(v,x) determines a linear function R^4 \\\\rarr R by x \\\\mapsto \\\\eta( v , x ) . Let N be the null space of this linear functional. Then N is called the simultaneous hyperplane with respect to v. The relativity of simultaneity is a statement that N depends on v. Indeed, N is the orthogonal complement of v with respect to Œ∑. When two world lines u and w are related by \\\\frac {du}{d\\\\tau} = \\\\frac {dw}{d\\\\tau}, then they share the same simultaneous hyperplane. This hyperplane exists mathematically, but physical relations in relativity involve the movement of information by light. For instance, the traditional electro-static force described by Coulomb's law may be pictured in a simultaneous hyperplane, but relativistic relations of charge and force involve retarded potentials. World lines in general relativity The use of world lines in general relativity is basically the same as in special relativity, with the difference that spacetime can be curved. A metric exists and its dynamics are determined by the Einstein field equations and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime. Again the metric defines lightlike (null), spacelike and timelike curves. Also, in general relativity, world lines are timelike curves in spacetime, where timelike curves fall within the lightcone. However, a lightcone is not necessarily inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. However, this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system, and reflects the coordinate freedom (diffeomorphism invariance) of general relativity. Any timelike curve admits a comoving observer whose \\"time axis\\" corresponds to that curve, and, since no observer is privileged, we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. See also for example Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates. World lines of free-falling particles or objects (such as planets around the Sun or an astronaut in space) are called geodesics. World lines in quantum field theory Quantum field theory, the framework in which all of modern particle physics is described, is usually described as a theory of quantized fields. However, although not widely appreciated, it has been known since Feynman that many quantum field theories may equivalently be described in terms of world lines. The world line formulation of quantum field theory has proved particularly fruitful for various calculations in gauge theories and in describing nonlinear effects of electromagnetic fields. World lines in literature In 1884 C. H. Hinton wrote an essay \\"What is the fourth dimension ?\\", which he published as a scientific romance. He wrote :Why, then, should not the four-dimensional beings be ourselves, and our successive states the passing of them through the three-dimensional space to which our consciousness is confined. A popular description of human world lines was given by J. C. Fields at the University of Toronto in the early days of relativity. As described by Toronto lawyer Norman Robertson: :I remember [Fields] lecturing at one of the Saturday evening lectures at the Royal Canadian Institute. It was advertised to be a \\"Mathematical Fantasy\\"‚Äîand it was! The substance of the exercise was as follows: He postulated that, commencing with his birth, every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached, that traveled behind him throughout his life. He then proceeded in imagination to describe the complicated entanglement every individual became involved in his relationship to other individuals, comparing the simple entanglements of youth to those complicated knots that develop in later life. Almost all science- fiction stories which use this concept actively, such as to enable time travel, oversimplify this concept to a one-dimensional timeline to fit a linear structure, which does not fit models of reality. Such time machines are often portrayed as being instantaneous, with its contents departing one time and arriving in another‚Äîbut at the same literal geographic point in space. This is often carried out without note of a reference frame, or with the implicit assumption that the reference frame is local; as such, this would require either accurate teleportation, as a rotating planet, being under acceleration, is not an inertial frame, or for the time machine to remain in the same place, its contents 'frozen'. Author Oliver Franklin published a science fiction work in 2008 entitled World Lines in which he related a simplified explanation of the hypothesis for laymen. In the short story Life- Line, author Robert A. Heinlein describes the world line of a person: :He stepped up to one of the reporters. \\"Suppose we take you as an example. Your name is Rogers, is it not? Very well, Rogers, you are a space-time event having duration four ways. You are not quite six feet tall, you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick. In time, there stretches behind you more of this space-time event, reaching to perhaps nineteen- sixteen, of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis, and as thick as the present. At the far end is a baby, smelling of sour milk and drooling its breakfast on its bib. At the other end lies, perhaps, an old man someplace in the nineteen-eighties. :\\"Imagine this space-time event that we call Rogers as a long pink worm, continuous through the years, one end in his mother's womb, and the other at the grave...\\" Heinlein's Methuselah's Children uses the term, as does James Blish's The Quincunx of Time (expanded from \\"Beep\\"). A visual novel named Steins;Gate, produced by 5pb., tells a story based on the shifting of world lines. Steins;Gate is a part of the \\"Science Adventure\\" series. World lines and other physical concepts like the Dirac Sea are also used throughout the series. Neal Stephenson's novel Anathem involves a long discussion of worldlines over dinner in the midst of a philosophical debate between Platonic realism and nominalism. Absolute Choice depicts different world lines as a sub-plot and setting device. A space armada trying to complete a (nearly) closed time-like path as a strategic maneuver forms the backdrop and a main plot device of \\"Singularity Sky\\" by Charles Stross.

Smith). His empirical findings challenge the assumption of human rationality prevailing in modern economic theory. With Amos Tversky and others, Kahneman established a cognitive basis for common human errors that arise from heuristics and biases (Kahneman & Tversky, 1973; Kahneman, Slovic & Tversky, 1982; Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), and developed prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its list of top global thinkers. In the same year, his book Thinking, Fast and Slow, which summarizes much of his research, was published and became a best seller. In 2015, The Economist listed him as the seventh most influential economist in the world. He is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. Kahneman is a founding partner of TGG Group, a business and philanthropy consulting company. He was married to cognitive psychologist and Royal Society Fellow Anne Treisman, who died in 2018. Biography Daniel Kahneman was born in Tel Aviv, Mandatory Palestine in 1934, where his mother, Rachel, was visiting relatives. He spent his childhood years in Paris, France, where his parents had emigrated from Lithuania in the early 1920s. Kahneman and his family were in Paris when it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1940. His father, Efrayim, was picked up in the first major round-up of French Jews, but he was released after six weeks due to the intervention of his employer, Eug√®ne Schueller. The family was on the run for the remainder of the war, and survived, except for the death of Kahneman's father due to diabetes in 1944. Kahneman and his family then moved to British Mandatory Palestine in 1948, just before the creation of the state of Israel (Kahneman, 2003). Kahneman has written of his experience in Nazi-occupied France, explaining in part why he entered the field of psychology: > It must have been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were required to wear the > Star of David and to obey a 6 p.m. curfew. I had gone to play with a > Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside > out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I > saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I > had been told to fear more than others ‚Äì the one worn by specially recruited > SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he > was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and > hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. > He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he > opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I > went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were > endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) Kahneman received his bachelor of science degree with a major in psychology, and a minor in mathematics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1954. After earning his undergraduate degree, he served in the psychology department of the Israeli Defense Forces. One of his responsibilities was to evaluate candidates for officer's training school, and to develop tests and measures for this purpose. In 1958, he went to the United States to study for his PhD in Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley. His 1961 dissertation, advised by Susan Ervin, examined relations between adjectives in the semantic differential and \\"allowed me to engage in two of my favorite pursuits: the analysis of complex correlational structures and FORTRAN programming,\\" as he would later recall. =Academic career=Cognitive psychology Kahneman began his academic career as a lecturer in psychology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1961. He was promoted to senior lecturer in 1966. His early work focused on visual perception and attention. For example, his first publication in the prestigious journal Science was entitled \\"Pupil Diameter and Load on Memory\\" (Kahneman & Beatty, 1966). During this period, Kahneman was a visiting scientist at the University of Michigan (1965‚Äì66) and the Applied Psychology Research Unit in Cambridge (1968/1969, summers). He was a fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies, and a lecturer in cognitive psychology at Harvard University in 1966/1967. Judgment and decision-making This period marks the beginning of Kahneman's lengthy collaboration with Amos Tversky. Together, Kahneman and Tversky published a series of seminal articles in the general field of judgment and decision- making, culminating in the publication of their prospect theory in 1979 (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Following this, the pair teamed with Paul Slovic to edit a compilation entitled \\"Judgement Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\\" (1982) that proved to be an important summary of their work and of other recent advances that had influenced their thinking. Kahneman was ultimately awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 2002 for his work on prospect theory. In his Nobel biography, Kahneman states that his collaboration with Tversky began after Kahneman had invited Tversky to give a guest lecture to one of Kahneman's seminars at Hebrew University in 1968 or 1969. Their first jointly written paper, \\"Belief in the Law of Small Numbers,\\" was published in 1971 (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971). They published seven articles in peer-reviewed journals in the years 1971‚Äì1979. Aside from \\"Prospect Theory,\\" the most important of these articles was \\"Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\\" (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), which was published in the prestigious journal Science and introduced the notion of anchoring. Kahneman left Hebrew University in 1978 to take a position at the University of British Columbia. Behavioral economics Kahneman and Tversky were both fellows at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University in the academic year 1977‚Äì1978. A young economist named Richard Thaler was a visiting professor at the Stanford branch of the National Bureau of Economic Research during that same year. According to Kahneman, \\"[Thaler and I] soon became friends, and have ever since had a considerable influence on each other's thinking\\" (Kahneman, 2003, p. 437). Building on prospect theory and Kahneman and Tversky's body of work, Thaler published \\"Toward a Positive Theory of Consumer Choice\\" in 1980, a paper which Kahneman has called \\"the founding text in behavioral economics\\" (Kahneman, 2003, p. 438). Kahneman and Tversky became heavily involved in the development of this new approach to economic theory, and their involvement in this movement had the effect of reducing the intensity and exclusivity of their earlier period of joint collaboration. They would continue to publish together until the end of Tversky's life, but the period when Kahneman published almost exclusively with Tversky ended in 1983, when he published two papers with Anne Treisman, his wife since 1978. Hedonic psychology In the 1990s, Kahneman's research focus began to gradually shift in emphasis towards the field of \\"hedonic psychology\\". This subfield is closely related to the positive psychology movement, which was steadily gaining in popularity at the time. According to Kahneman and colleagues, > Hedonic psychology...is the study of what makes experiences and life > pleasant or unpleasant. It is concerned with feelings of pleasure and pain, > of interest and boredom, of joy and sorrow, and of satisfaction and > dissatisfaction. It is also concerned with the whole range of circumstances, > from the biological to the societal, that occasion suffering and enjoyment. It is difficult to determine precisely when Kahneman's research began to focus on hedonics, although it likely stemmed from his work on the economic notion of utility. After publishing multiple articles and chapters in all but one of the years spanning the period 1979‚Äì1986 (for a total of 23 published works in 8 years), Kahneman published exactly one chapter during the years 1987‚Äì1989. After this hiatus, articles on utility and the psychology of utility began to appear (e.g., Kahneman & Snell, 1990; Kahneman & Thaler, 1991; Kahneman & Varey, 1991). In 1992, Varey and Kahneman introduced the method of evaluating moments and episodes as a way to capture \\"experiences extended across time\\". While Kahneman continued to study decision-making (e.g., Kahneman, 1992, 1994; Kahneman & Lovallo, 1993), hedonic psychology was the focus of an increasing number of publications (e.g., Fredrickson & Kahneman, 1993; Kahneman, Fredrickson, Schreiber & Redelemeier, 1993; Kahneman, Wakker & Sarin, 1997; Redelmeier & Kahneman, 1996), culminating in a volume co-edited with Ed Diener and Norbert Schwarz, scholars of affect and well-being. With David Schkade, Kahneman developed the notion of the focusing illusion (Kahneman & Schkade, 1998; Kahneman, Krueger, Schkade, Schwarz & Stone, 2006) to explain in part the mistakes people make when estimating the effects of different scenarios on their future happiness (also known as affective forecasting, which has been studied extensively by Daniel Gilbert). The \\"illusion\\" occurs when people consider the impact of one specific factor on their overall happiness, they tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact. A good example is provided by Kahneman and Schkade's 1998 paper \\"Does living in California make people happy? A focusing illusion in judgments of life satisfaction\\". In that paper, students in the Midwest and in California reported similar levels of life satisfaction, but the Midwesterners thought their Californian peers would be happier. The only distinguishing information the Midwestern students had when making these judgments was the fact that their hypothetical peers lived in California. Thus, they \\"focused\\" on this distinction, thereby overestimating the effect of the weather in California on its residents' satisfaction with life. Life satisfaction Kahneman has said that in reality humans pursue life satisfaction, which ‚Äúis connected to a large degree to social yardsticks‚Äìachieving goals, meeting expectations.‚Äù =Teaching= Kahneman is a senior scholar and faculty member emeritus at Princeton University's Department of Psychology and Princeton School of Public and International Affairs. He is also a fellow at Hebrew University and a Gallup Senior Scientist. =Personal life= Kahneman's first wife was Irah Kahneman, an Israeli educational psychologist, with whom he had two children. His second wife was the cognitive psychologist Anne Treisman from 1978 until her death in 2018. As of 2014, they lived part-time in Berkeley, California. Kahneman has been described as a Jewish atheist.

Much of his early work concerned the foundations of measurement. He was co-author of a three-volume treatise, Foundations of Measurement. His early work with Kahneman focused on the psychology of prediction and probability judgment; later they worked together to develop prospect theory, which aims to explain irrational human economic choices and is considered one of the seminal works of behavioral economics. Six years after Tversky's death, Kahneman received the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for the work he did in collaboration with Amos Tversky. (The prize is not awarded posthumously.) Kahneman told The New York Times in an interview soon after receiving the honor: \\"I feel it is a joint prize. We were twinned for more than a decade.\\" Tversky also collaborated with many leading researchers including Thomas Gilovich, Itamar Simonson, Paul Slovic and Richard Thaler. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Tversky as the 93rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, tied with Edwin Boring, John Dewey, and Wilhelm Wundt. Biography Tversky was born in Haifa, British Palestine (now Israel), as son of the Polish-born veterinarian Yosef Tversky and Lithuanian Jewish Jenia Tversky (n√©e Ginzburg), a social worker who later became member of parliament for the Mapai (worker's party).A Psychologist Who Shed Light on Our Irrationality Is Born Haaretz, 16 March 2016 Tversky had one sister, Ruth, thirteen years his senior. In high school, Tversky took classes from literary critic Baruch Kurzweil, and befriended classmate Dahlia Ravikovich, who would become an award-winning poet. During this time, he was also a member and leader in Nahal, a youth movement meant to combine farming and military service. Tversky served with distinction in the Israel Defense Forces as a paratrooper, rising to the rank of captain and being decorated for bravery. He parachuted in combat zones during the Suez Crisis in 1956, commanded an infantry unit during the Six-Day War in 1967, and served in a psychology field unit during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. In 1963, Tversky married American psychologist Barbara Gans, now a professor in the human development department at Teachers College, Columbia University. They had three children together. Tversky received his bachelor's degree from Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel in 1961, and his doctorate from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1965. He later taught at Hebrew University before joining the faculty of Stanford University in 1978, where he spent the rest of his career. In 1980 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterT.pdf In 1984 he was a recipient of the MacArthur Fellowship, and in 1985 he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Tversky, co-recipient with Daniel Kahneman, earned the 2003 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Psychology. He died of a metastatic melanoma in 1996. He was a Jewish atheist.Engber, Daniel. ‚ÄúHow a Pioneer in the Science of Mistakes Ended Up Mistaken.‚Äù Slate Magazine, 21 December 2016. \\"It‚Äôs a portrait of besotted opposites: Both Kahneman and Tversky were brilliant scientists, and atheist Israeli Jews... Career=Work with Daniel Kahneman= Amos Tversky's most influential work was done with his longtime collaborator, Daniel Kahneman, in a partnership that began in the late 1960s. Their work explored the biases and failures in rationality continually exhibited in human decision-making. Starting with their first paper together, \\"Belief in the Law of Small Numbers\\", Kahneman and Tversky laid out eleven \\"cognitive illusions\\" that affect human judgment, frequently using small-scale empirical experiments that demonstrate how subjects make irrational decisions under uncertain conditions. This work was highly influential in the field of economics, which had largely presumed rationality of all actors. =Comparative ignorance= Tversky and Fox (1995) addressed ambiguity aversion, the idea that people do not like ambiguous gambles or choices with ambiguity, with the comparative ignorance framework. Their idea was that people are only ambiguity averse when their attention is specifically brought to the ambiguity by comparing an ambiguous option to an unambiguous option. For instance, people are willing to bet more on choosing a correct colored ball from an urn containing equal proportions of black and red balls than an urn with unknown proportions of balls when evaluating both of these urns at the same time. However, when evaluating them separately, people are willing to bet approximately the same amount on either urn. Thus, when it is possible to compare the ambiguous gamble to an unambiguous gamble people are averse ‚Äî but not when one is ignorant of this comparison. =Notable contributions= The shape of the value (utility) function in prospect theory.

The duchy was located between the Harz Mountains in the west and the river Elbe and beyond to the Fl√§ming Heath in the east. The territory was once ruled by the House of Ascania, and is now part of the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt. History Anhalt's origins lie in the Principality of Anhalt, a state of the Holy Roman Empire. =Dukes of Anhalt= During the 9th century, most of Anhalt was part of the duchy of Saxony. In the 12th century, it came under the rule of Albert the Bear, margrave of Brandenburg. Albert was descended from Albert, count of Ballenstedt, whose son Esico (died 1059 or 1060) appears to have been the first to bear the title of count of Anhalt. Esico's grandson, Otto the Rich, count of Ballenstedt, was the father of Albert the Bear, who united Anhalt with the Margraviate of Brandenburg (March of Brandenburg). When Albert died in 1170, his son Bernard, who received the title of duke of Saxony in 1180, became count of Anhalt. Bernard died in 1212, and Anhalt, separated from Saxony, passed to his son Henry I, who in 1218 took the title of prince and was the real founder of the house of Anhalt. =Princes of Anhalt= On Henry's death in 1252, his three sons divided the principality and founded the respective lines of Aschersleben, Bernburg and Zerbst. The family ruling in Aschersleben became extinct in 1315, and this district was subsequently incorporated with the neighbouring Bishopric of Halberstadt. The last prince of the line of Anhalt-Bernburg died in 1468 and his lands were inherited by the princes of the sole remaining line, that of Anhalt-Zerbst. The territory belonging to this branch of the family had been divided in 1396, and after the acquisition of Bernburg Prince George I made a further partition of Zerbst (Zerbst and Dessau). Early in the 16th century, however, owing to the death or abdication of several princes, the family had become narrowed down to the two branches of Anhalt-K√∂then and Anhalt-Dessau (both issued from Anhalt-Dessau in 1471 . Wolfgang, who became prince of Anhalt-K√∂then in 1508, was a staunch supporter of the Reformation, and after the Battle of M√ºhlberg in 1547 was placed under Imperial ban and deprived of his lands by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor. After the peace of Passau in 1552, Prince Wolfgang bought back his principality, but as he was childless he surrendered it in 1562 to his kinsmen, the princes of Anhalt-Dessau. Ernest I (died 1516) left three sons, John V, George III, and Joachim I, who ruled their lands together for many years, and who, like Prince Wolfgang, favoured the reformed doctrines, which thus became dominant in Anhalt. Around 1546, the three brothers divided their principality and founded the lines of Zerbst, Pl√∂tzkau and Dessau. This division, however, was only temporary, as the acquisition of K√∂then, and a series of deaths among the ruling princes, enabled Joachim Ernest, a son of John II, to unite the whole of Anhalt under his rule in 1570. The first united principality of Anhalt was short-lived, and in 1603, it was split up into the mini-states of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-K√∂then, Anhalt-Zerbst and Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau. Joachim Ernest died in 1586 and his five sons ruled the land in common until 1603, when Anhalt was again divided, and the lines of Dessau, Bernburg, Pl√∂tzkau, Zerbst and K√∂then were re-founded. The principality was ravaged during the Thirty Years' War, and in the earlier part of this struggle Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg took an important part. In 1635, an arrangement was made by the various princes of Anhalt, which gave a certain authority to the eldest member of the family, who was thus able to represent the principality as a whole. This proceeding was probably due to the necessity of maintaining an appearance of unity in view of the disturbed state of European politics. In 1665, the branch of Anhalt-K√∂then became extinct, and according to a family compact this district was inherited by Lebrecht of Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau, who surrendered Pl√∂tzkau to Bernburg, and took the title of prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. In the same year the princes of Anhalt decided that, if any branch of the family became extinct, its lands should be equally divided between the remaining branches. This arrangement was carried out after the death of Frederick Augustus, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst in 1793, and Zerbst was divided between the three remaining princes. During these years the policy of the different princes was marked, perhaps intentionally, by considerable uniformity. Once or twice, Calvinism was favoured by a prince, but in general the house was loyal to the doctrines of Martin Luther. The growth of Prussia provided Anhalt with a formidable neighbour, and the establishment and practice of primogeniture by all branches of the family prevented further divisions of the principality. =19th century duchies= In 1806, Napoleon elevated the remaining states of Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt- K√∂then to duchies (Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau and Anhalt-Zerbst had ceased to exist in the meantime). These duchies were united in 1863 to form a united Anhalt again due to the extinction of the K√∂then and Bernburg lines. The new duchy consisted of two large portions ‚Äì Eastern and Western Anhalt, separated by the interposition of a part of the Prussian Province of Saxony ‚Äì and of five enclaves surrounded by Prussian territory: Alsleben, Muhlingen, Dornburg, G√∂dnitz and Tilkerode-Abberode. The eastern and larger portion of the duchy was enclosed by the Prussian government district of Potsdam (in the Prussian province of Brandenburg), and Magdeburg and Merseburg (belonging to the Prussian province of Saxony). The western or smaller portion (the so-called Upper Duchy or Ballenstedt) was also enclosed by the two latter districts and by the duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. The capital of Anhalt (at the times when it was a united state) was Dessau. In 1918, Anhalt became a state within the Weimar Republic (see Free State of Anhalt). After World War II it was united with the Prussian parts of Saxony in order to form the new area of Saxony- Anhalt. Having been dissolved in 1952, the state was reestablished prior to the German reunification and is now part of the Bundesland Saxony-Anhalt in Germany. Constitution The duchy, by virtue of a fundamental law, proclaimed on September 17, 1859 and subsequently modified by various decrees, was a constitutional monarchy. The duke, who was addressed as \\"Highness,\\" wielded the executive power while sharing the legislation with the estates. The diet (Landtag) was composed of thirty-six members, of whom two were appointed by the duke, eight were representatives of landowners paying the highest taxes, two of the highest assessed members of the commercial and manufacturing classes, fourteen of the other electors of the towns and ten of the rural districts. The representatives were chosen for six years by indirect vote and must have completed their twenty-fifth year. The duke governed through a minister of state, who was the praeses of all the departments‚Äîfinance, home affairs, education, public worship and statistics. Geography In the west, the land is undulating and in the extreme southwest, where it forms part of the Harz range, mountainous, the Ramberg peak being the tallest at 1900 ft (579 m). From the Harz, the country gently slopes down to the Saale; between this river and the Elbe is fertile country. East of the Elbe, the land is mostly a flat sandy plain, with extensive pine forests, interspersed with bog-land and rich pastures. The Elbe is the chief river, intersecting the eastern portion of the former duchy, from east to west, and at Rosslau is met by the Mulde. The navigable Saale takes a northerly direction through the western portion of the eastern part of the territory and receives, on the right, the Fuhne and, on the left, the Wipper and the Bode. The climate is generally mild, less so in the higher regions to the south-west. The area of the former duchy is . The population was 203,354 in 1871 and 328,007 in 1905. The country was divided into the districts of Dessau, K√∂then, Zerbst, Bernburg and Ballenstedt with Bernburg being the most, and Ballenstedt the least. populated. Four towns, namely Dessau, Bernburg, C√∂then and Zerbst, had populations exceeding 20,000. The inhabitants of the former duchy, who were primarily upper Saxons, belonged, with the exception of about 12,000 Roman Catholics and 1700 Jews, to the Evangelical Church. The supreme ecclesiastical authority was the consistory in Dessau; while a synod of 39 members, elected for six years, assembled at periods to deliberate on internal matters touching the organization of Church of Anhalt. The Roman Catholics were under the Bishop of Paderborn.

The Bashkir language is included in the list of endangered languages.Wurm, Stephen A. Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger of Disappearing. Unesco, 2001.  Ethnonym  The etymology and indeed meaning of the endonym Bashqort is without consensus. The following theories of origin and definition have been advanced: * The 18th-century ethnographers V. N. Tatishchev, P. I. Richkov, and Johann Gottlieb Georgi, according to a recorded folk etymology, the word Bashqort, originally meant: \\"wolf leader\\" (i.e. bash \\"head\\" and qort \\"wolf\\"). * In 1847, the historian V. S. Yumatov suggested the original meaning to be: \\"beekeeper, beemaster\\". * Historian and ethnologist A. E. Alektorov (1885) suggested that Bashqort meant \\"distinct nation\\". *Anthropologist R. M. Yusupov considered Bashqort may have originally been an Iranian compound word meaning: \\"wolf-children\\" or \\"descendants of heroes\\", i.e. bacha \\"descendant, child\\" and gurd \\"hero\\" or gurg \\"wolf\\". * Historian and archaeologist Mikhail Artamonov suggested that the word is a corruption of the name of the Bu≈°xk' (or Bwsxk), a Scythian tribe speaking Iranian-that lived in the area now known as Bashkortostan.Peter B. Golden, Haggai Ben-Shammai & Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas, The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives, Leiden/Boston, Brill, 2007, pp. 422. * The Turkologist N. A. Baskakov believed the term: \\"Bashqort\\" to have consisted of two parts: \\"badz(a)\\" ‚Äì brother-in-law\\" and \\"(o)gur\\" meaning: \\"brothers-in-law of the Ugor [Magyars]\\". * According to the orientalist Douglas Morton Dunlop, the ethnonym Bashqort was derived from beshgur (or bashgur) which means \\"five tribes in modern Bashkir language. * Ethnologist N. V. Bikbulatov suggested that the term originated from the name of a legendary Khazar warlord named Bashgird, who ruled an area centred on the Jayƒ±q river. * Ethnologist R. G. Kuzeev derived the ethnonym from a compound of \\"bash\\" ‚Äî \\"main, head\\" and \\"qort\\" ‚Äî \\" clan, tribe\\". * Historian and linguist Andr√°s R√≥na-Tas argued the ethnonym \\"Bashkir\\" to be a Bulgar Turkic reflex of the Hungarian endonym Magyar (or the Old Hungarian Majer).  History =Origins= The Bashkirs are considered to have some cultural similarities to Iranian tribes who formerly existed in modern Bashkortostan, such as the Bu≈°xk', and may have descended from them.Maria Magdolna Tat√°r, ‚ÄúThe Myth of Macha in Eastern Europe‚Äù, The Journal of Indo-European Studies vol. 35, no. 3 & 4, Fall/Winter 2007, p. 325. Alternatively, Mikhail Artamonov suggested Bashkirs are descended from the Bu≈°xk', a Scythian tribe that became culturally \\"Turkified\\" (including a process of language replacement), during the Turkic migrations of the first millennium AD. = Middle ages = Mausoleum of Husseinbek of the 14th century in Bashkortostan Mausoleum of Turakhan of the 15th century in Bashkortostan The first report about Bashkirs might have been found in the Chinese chronicle Book of Sui: around 40 Turkic Tiele tribes were named (636 AD) in \\"A Narration about the Tiele people\\"; Bashkirs might have included within that narration: if the tribal name ÊØîÂπ≤ (Mandarin B«êgƒÅn < Middle Chinese ZS: *pi…™X-k…ën) were read as ÊØîÂçÉ (Bƒ≠qiƒÅn < *pi…™XtÕ°s ∞en), according to Chinese scholar Rui Chuanming In the 7th century, Bashkirs are also mentioned in \\"Ashkharatsuyts\\". From the 9th century, the first Arab and Persian written reports about Bashkirs commence. These include reports by:: Sallam al- Tardzhuman (9th century). 10th-century authors on the Bashkir were: Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Al-Masudi, and Abu Zayd al-Balkhi. In the 12th century, Said Al- Andalusi and Muhammad al-Idrisi mentioned the Bashkirs. The 13th-century authors Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, Yaqut al-Hamawi and Qazvini and the 14th- century authors Al-Dimashqi and Abu'l-Fida wrote about Bashkirs. The traveller Sallam an at-Tardzhuman visited Bashkir lands and wrote in circa 840 the first written Arab source on the Bashkirs and a rough description of its borders. In the 10th century, Persian Abu Zayd al-Balkhi (10th century) described Bashkirs as a people divided into two groups: one inhabiting the Southern Urals, the other living on the Danube plain near the boundaries of Byzantium. Ibn Rustah, a contemporary of Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, observed that Bashkirs were an independent people occupying territories on both sides of the Ural mountains ridge between Volga, Kama, and Tobol Rivers and upstream of the Yaik river. Ahmad ibn Fadlan, ambassador of the Baghdad Caliph Al-Muqtadir to the governor of Volga Bulgaria, wrote the first ethnographic description of the Bashkir in 922. The Bashkirs, according to Ibn Fadlan, were a warlike and powerful people, which he and his companions (a total of five thousand people, including military protection) \\"bewared... with the greatest threat\\". They were described as engaged in cattle breeding. According to ibn Fadlan, the Bashkirs worshipped twelve gods: winter, summer, rain, wind, trees, people, horses, water, night, day, death, heaven and earth, and the most prominent, the sky god. Apparently, Islam had already begun to spread among the Bashkirs, as one of the ambassadors was a Muslim Bashkir. According to the testimony of Ibn Fadlan, the Bashkirs were Turks, living on the southern slopes of the Urals, and occupying a vast territory up to the river Volga. They were bordered by Oghuz Turks on the south, Pechenegs to the south-east and Bulgars on the west. The first European sources to mention the Bashkirs were the works of Joannes de Plano Carpini and William of Rubruquis of the 13th century. By 1236, Genghis Khan had incorporated the lands of Bashkortostan were incorporated into his empire. During the 13th and 14th centuries, all of Bashkortostan was a component of the Golden Horde. The brother of Batu-Khan, Sheibani, received the Bashkir lands east of the Ural Mountains. After the disintegration of the Mongol Empire, the Bashkirs were divided among the Nogai Horde, the Khanate of Kazan and the Khanate of Sibir, founded in the 15th century. = Early modern period = Bashkir riders Bashkir sculpture in the haven of Veessen, Netherlands In the middle of the 16th century, Bashkirs were gradually conquered by the Tsardom of Russia. Primary documents pertaining to the Bashkirs during this period have been lost, although some are mentioned in the shezhere (family trees) of the Bashkir. During the Russian Imperial period, Russians and Tatars began to migrate to Bashkortostan which led to eventual demographic changes in the region. The recruitment of Bashkirs into the Russian army and having to pay steep taxes pressured many Bashkirs to adopt a more settled lifestyle and to slowly abandon their ancient nomadic pastoralist past. In the late 16th and early 19th centuries, Bashkirs occupied the territory from the river Sylva in the north; to the river heads of Tobol in the east; the mid-stream of the river Yaik in the south; in the Middle and Southern Urals, the Cis-Urals including Volga territory and Trans-Uralsto; and the eastern bank of the river Volga on the south-west. = Bashkir rebellions of the 17th‚Äì18th centuries = This Bashkir wears a medallion, which identifies him as the village chief.

Kumis cooking, the beginning of the 20th century Bashkirs in Orenburg, at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the victory in the Patriotic War of 1812, 1913 The Bashkirs participated in the 1662‚Äì64, 1681‚Äì84 and 1704‚Äì11 Rebellions. In 1676, the Bashkirs rebelled under a leader named Seyid Sadir or 'Seit Sadurov', and the Russian army had great difficulties in ending the rebellion. The Bashkirs rose again in 1707, under Aldar and K√ªsyom, due to perceived ill-treatment by Imperial Russian officials. At the founding of Orenburg in 1735, the fourth insurrection occurred in 1735 and lasted six years. Russians had discussed from the times of Peter the Great a desire to expand Russian sovereignty south-east toward Persia and India. Ivan Kirillov formed a plan to build the fort to be called Orenburg at Orsk at the confluence of the Or River and the Ural River, south- east of the Urals where the Bashkir, Kalmyk and Kazakh lands met. Work on Fort Orenburg commenced at Orsk in 1735. However, by 1743 'Orenburg' was moved a further 250 km west to its current location. The next planned construction was to be a fort on the Aral Sea. The consequence of the Aral Sea fort would involve crossing Bashkir and the Kazakh Lesser Horde lands, some of whom had recently offered a nominal submission to the Russian Crown. Kirillov's plan was approved on May 1, 1734 and he was placed in command. Although Kirillov was warned that this may provoke a Bashkir rebellion, the warnings were ignored. Kirillov left Ufa with 2,500 men in 1735. Warfare commenced on the first of July, 1735. The war consisted of many small raids and complex troop movements, so it cannot be easily summarized. For example: In the spring of 1736, Kirillov burned 200 villages, killed 700 in battle and executed 158. An expedition of 773 men left Orenburg in November and lost 500 from cold and hunger. At Seiantusa the Bashkir planned to massacre sleeping Russians, however, the ambush failed. In retaliation, one thousand villagers, including women and children, were put to the sword and another 500 driven into a storehouse and burned to death. Raiding parties then went out and burned about 50 villages and killed another 2,000. Eight thousand Bashkirs attacked a Russian camp and killed 158, losing 40 killed and three Bashkir prisoners were promptly hanged by the Russians. Rebellious Bashkirs raided loyal Bashkirs. Leaders who submitted were sometimes fined one horse per household and on other occasions, hanged. Kirillov died of disease during the war and there were several changes of commander. The Bashkir War occurred during the reign of Empress Anna of Russia and the Russo-Turkish War (1735‚Äì1739). Although the history of the 1735 Bashkir War cannot be easily summarized, its results were: *The Russian Imperial goal of expansion into Central Asia was delayed to deal with the Bashkir problem. *Bashkiria was pacified in 1735‚Äì1740. *Orenburg was established. *The southern side of Bashkiria was partitioned by the Orenburg Line of forts. The forts ran from Samara on the Volga east as far as the Samara River headwaters.. It then crossed to the middle of the Ural River and following the river course east and then north on the eastern side of the Urals. It then went east along the Uy River to Ust-Uisk on the Tobol River where it connected to the ill-defined 'Siberian Line' along the forest-steppe boundary. *In 1740 a report was made of Bashkir losses which listed: Killed: 16,893; sent to Baltic regiments and fleet: 3,236; women & children distributed (presumably as serfs): 8,382 with a grand total of 28,511. Fines were reported as: horses: 12,283; cattle and sheep: 6,076; money: 9,828 rubles; villages destroyed: 696. The compilation was from army reports and excluded losses from irregular raiding, hunger, disease and cold. At the time, the Bashkir population was estimated at 100,000. Next major rebellion occurred in 1755‚Äì56. In its suppression, 36,000 Russian regular troops were involved. The number of rebels was about 50,000. The rebellion was cruelly crushed. Later, in 1774, the Bashkirs, under the leadership of Salavat Yulayev, supported Pugachev's Rebellion. In 1786, the Bashkirs achieved tax-free status; and in 1798 Russia formed an irregular Bashkir army from among them. Residual land ownership disputes continued. = Napoleonic Wars = During the Napoleonic Wars, many Kalmyks and Bashkirs served in the Russian army to defend the Russian nation from the French invaders during Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Many Bashkir regiments served in Battle of Paris and the subsequent occupation of France by the coalition forces. = The establishment of the Republic of Bashkortostan = The Members Of The Bashkir Government, 1920 Monuments to Bashkir soldiers in Leipzig After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the All-Bashkir Qoroltays (convention) concluded that it was necessary to form a national federal Bashkir republic within Russia. As a result, on 15 November 1917, the Bashkir Regional (central) Shuro (Council) proclaimed the establishment of the Bashkir republic in areas of predominantly Bashkir population: Orenburg, Perm, Samara, Ufa provinces and the autonomous entity Bashkurdistan. In December 1917, delegates to the All-Bashkir (constituent) Congress, representing the interests of the population edge of all nationalities, voted unanimously for the Resolution (Farman #2) of the Bashkir regional Shuro on the proclamation of national-territorial autonomy (of the republic) Bashkurdistan. From the Congress, the government of Bashkurdistan, the Pre-parliament ‚Äì Kese-Qoroltay and other bodies of power and administration, were formed and decisions made on how next to proceed. In March 1919, the Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was formed based on agreements of the Russian Government. On October 11, 1990 Declaration of State Sovereignty by the Supreme Council of the Republic was proclaimed. On March 31, 1992 Bashkortostan signed a federal agreement on the delimitation of powers and areas of jurisdiction and the nature of contractual relations between the authorities of the Russian Federation and the authorities of the sovereign republics in its composition including the Republic of Bashkortostan. = World War II = During World War II, Bashkir soldiers served in the Red Army to defend the Soviet Union and fought against the Germans during the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Some Bashkir soldiers also fought for the German Wehrmacht in the Ostlegionen Idel-Ural Legion. This unit composed approximately 12,500 individuals, but included Tatars, Chuvashes, Udmurts, and Mordvins as well as Bashkirs. http://stosstruppen39-45.tripod.com/id10.html Hitler's Soviet Muslim Legionshttp://anthrocivitas.net/forum/showthread.php?t=6814 Volga Tatar Legion Idel-Ural signs Idel-Ural Legionaries brought together about 40,000 volunteers mainly ex-prisoners of war.  Genetics  Bashkir Sabantuy The modern Bashkirs have an average of approximately 60% \\"West-Eurasian/European\\" and 40% \\"Siberian/East-Asian\\" genetic material. Genetic studies have revealed Y-DNA haplogroups the dominant frequency for Bashkir males is the haplogroup R1b (R-M269 and R-M73) which is, on average, 47.6%. The Y-DNA haplogroup R-M269 (R1b1a2) is the most common European haplogroup, greatly increasing in frequency on a West to East its prevalence in Wales at 92.3% to Poland estimated at 22.7%. The second most dominant is the haplogroup R1a at an average frequency of 26,5%, and third the haplogroup N1c at 17%. Despite the Bashkirs being considered a Turkic peoples, DNA haplogroups R1a and R1b are majority shared with Indo-Europeans.

Immunogeneticist Suslova commented in 2015 that: The Bashkirs are characterized by East-Asian admixture, which dates from the 13th century, according to an analysis of the identical-by-descent segments. A group of Bashkirs from the Burzyansky and Abzelilovsky districts of the Republic of Bashkortostan in the Volga-Ural region who belong to the R1a subclade R-SUR51 are the closest kin of the Hungarian √Årp√°d dynasty, from which got separated 2000 years ago.  Language  Bashkir language is a Turkic language of the Kypchak group. It has three main dialects: Southern, Eastern and North-Western located in the territory of Historical Bashkortostan. The Russian census of 2010 recorded 1,152,404 Bashkir speakers in the Russian Federation. Bashkir language is native to 1 133 339 Bashkirs (71,7% of the total number of Bashkirs, reporting mother tongue). The Tatar language was reported as native tongue to 230,846 Bashkirs (14,6%). and Russian language reported as native tongue to 216 066 Bashkir (13,7%). Most Bashkirs are bilingual in Bashkir and Russian. The Bashkir tribes of pre-Islamic conversion used the Old Turkic alphabet. After the adoption of Islam, which began in the 10th century and lasted for several centuries, the Bashkirs began to use the Arabic alphabet. From the mid-18th- century Bashkir national literature began to be formulated. In 1923, Bashkir alphabet was based on the Arabic alphabet. In 1929 a Latin alphabet (yanalif) form of transcribing Bashkir was formulated. In 1940, writing Bashkir in Cyrillic alphabet was formulated. The modern Bashkir alphabet consists of 42 letters. The Bashkir language was considered endangered but recent Bashkir nationalism has made many develop an interest in it. The combination of encouragement by local authorities and renewed Bashkir language interest among Bashkirs have greatly assisted the language to stay relevant.  Demographics  The area settled by the Bashkirs according to the national census of 2010. The ethnic Bashkir population is estimated at roughly 2 million people (2009 SIL Ethnologue). The 2010 Russian census recorded 1,584,554 ethnic Bashkirs in Russia, of which 1,172,287 Bashkirs live in Bashkortostan (29.5% of the total population of the republic).  Culture  Bashkirs in traditional clothing, Ufa, 2016 The Bashkirs traditionally practiced agriculture, cattle-rearing and bee-keeping. The half-nomadic Bashkirs wandered either the mountains or the steppes, herding cattle. Wild-hive beekeeping can be named as a separate component of the most ancient culture which is practiced in the same Burzyansky District near to the Kapova Cave. Traditional Bashkir dish bishbarmaq is prepared from boiled meat and halma (the kind of noodles), sprinkled with herbs flavored with onions and some qorot (young dry cheese). This is another notable feature of the Bashkir cuisine: dishes often served dairy products ‚Äî rare party without qorot or qaymaq (sour cream). Most of the dishes Bashkir cuisine is nutritious and easy to prepare. A series of epic Bashkir works called Ural-batyr and Akbuzat keeps layers of ancient mythology and have parallels with the Epic of Gilgamesh, Rigveda, and Avesta. Their plots concern the struggle of heroes against demonic forces. A peculiarity of them is that events and ceremonies described there may reference a specific geographical place; the Shulgan-Tash cave and its vicinity.

Maqamat of al-Hariri. Illustration by Yahy√° al-Wasiti, Baghdad, 1237 In Islam, the ulama (; ', singular ', \\"scholar\\", literally \\"the learned ones\\", also spelled ulema; feminine: alimah [singular] and uluma [plural]) are the guardians, transmitters, and interpreters of religious knowledge in Islam, including Islamic doctrine and law. By longstanding tradition, ulama are educated in religious institutions (madrasas). The Quran and sunnah (authentic hadith) are the scriptural sources of traditional Islamic law. Traditional way of education Ijazah (diploma of competency) in Arabic calligraphy, written by 'Ali Ra'if Efendi in 1206 AH (1791 AD) Students did not associate themselves with a specific educational institution, but rather sought to join renowned teachers. By tradition, a scholar who had completed his studies was approved by his teacher. At the teacher's individual discretion, the student was given the permission for teaching and for the issuing of legal opinions (fatwa). The official approval was known as the ijazat at-tadris wa 'l-ifta (\\"license to teach and issue legal opinions\\"). Through time, this practice established a chain of teachers and pupils who became teachers in their own time. Places of learning Endowment charter (vakƒ±f-nƒÅme) of the H√ºrrem Sultan mosque, madrasa and soup kitchen in Jerusalem The traditional place of higher education was the madrasa. The institution likely came up in Khurasan during the 10th century AD, and spread to other parts of the Islamic world from the late 11th century onwards. The most famous early madrasas are the Sunni Ni·∫ìƒÅmiyya, founded by the Seljuk vizir Nizam al-Mulk (1018‚Äì1092) in Iran and Iraq in the 11th century. The Mustansiriya, established by the Abbasid caliph Al-Mustansir in Baghdad in 1234 AD, was the first to be founded by a caliph, and also the first known to host teachers of all four major madhhab known at that time. From the time of the Persian Ilkhanate (1260‚Äì1335 AD) and the Timurid dynasty (1370‚Äì1507 AD) onwards, madrasas often became part of an architectural complex which also included a mosque, a Sufi ·π≠arƒ´qa, and other buildings of socio-cultural function, like baths or a hospital. Madrasas were merely (sacred) places of learning. They provided boarding and salaries to a limited number of teachers, and boarding for a number of students out of the revenue from religious endowments (waqf), allocated to a specific institution by the donor. In later times, the deeds of endowment were issued in elaborate Islamic calligraphy, as is the case for Ottoman endowment books (vakƒ±f-name). The donor could also specify the subjects to be taught, the qualification of the teachers, or which madhhab the teaching should follow. However, the donor was free to specify in detail the curriculum, as was shown by Ahmed and Filipovic (2004) for the Ottoman imperial madrasas founded by Suleiman the Magnificent. As Berkey (1992) has described in detail for the education in medieval Cairo, unlike medieval Western universities, in general madrasas had no distinct curriculum, and did not issue diplomas. The educational activities of the madrasas focused on the law, but also included what Zaman (2010) called \\"Sharia sciences\\" (al-  øul≈´m al-naqliyya) as well as the rational sciences like philosophy, astronomy, mathematics or medicine. The inclusion of these sciences sometimes reflect the personal interests of their donors, but also indicate that scholars often studied various different sciences. Branches of learning=Mysticism= Early on in Islamic history, a line of thought developed around the idea of mysticism, striving for the perfection (Ihsan) of worship. Originating out of Syria and Iraq rather than the Hijaz, the idea of Sufism was related to devotional practices of Eastern Christian monasticism, although monastic life in Islam is discouraged by the Quran. During the first Islamic century, ·∏§asan al-Ba·π£rƒ´ (642‚Äì728 AD) was one of the first Muslim scholars to describe, according to Albert Hourani (1991) \\"the sense of the distance and nearness of God ... in the language of love\\". During the 7th century, the ritual of Dhikr evolved as a \\"way of freeing the soul from the distractions of the world\\". Important early scholars who further elaborated on mysticism were Harith al-Muhasibi (781‚Äì857 AD) and Junayd al-Baghdadi (835‚Äì910 AD). =Philosophy and ethics= The early Muslim conquests brought about Arab Muslim rule over large parts of the Hellenistic world. During the time of the Umayyad Caliphate, at latest, the scholars of the emerging Islamic society had become familiar with the classical philosophical and scientific traditions of the world they had conquered. The collection of classical works and their translation into the Arabian language initiated a period which is known today as the Islamic Golden Age. According to Hourani (1991), the works of the classical scholars of antiquity were met with considerable intellectual curiosity by Islamic scholars. Hourani quotes al-Kindi (c. 801‚Äì873 AD), \\"the father of Islamic philosophy\\", as follows: > \\"We should not be ashamed to acknowledge truth from whatever source it comes > to us, even if it is brought to us by former generations and foreign > peoples. For him who seeks the truth there is nothing of higher value than > truth itself.\\" The works of Aristotle, in particular his Nicomachean Ethics, had a profound influence on the Islamic scholars of the Golden Age like Al-Farabi (870‚Äì950 AD), Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri (d. 992 AD) and Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ (ca. 980‚Äì1037 AD). In general, the Islamic philosophers saw no contradiction between philosophy and the religion of Islam. However, according to Hourani, al-Farabi also wrote that philosophy in its pure form was reserved for an intellectual elite, and that ordinary people should rely for guidance on the sharia. The distinction between a scholarly elite and the less educated masses \\"was to become a commonplace of Islamic thought\\". As exemplified by the works of al-Razi (854‚Äì925 AD), during later times, philosophy \\"was carried on as a private activity, largely by medical men, pursued with discretion, and often met with suspicion\\". The founder of Islamic philosophical ethics is Ibn Miskawayh (932‚Äì1030 AD) He combined Aristotelian and Islamic ethics, explicitly mentioning the Nicomachean Ethics and its interpretation by Porphyry of Gaza as the foundation of his philosophical thoughts.Ibn Miskawayh: Refinement of Morals and Cleansing of Ethics.  øAbdel- øAlim Salih (Ed.), Cairo 1326 (1908 AD), p. 10, cited after In the 12th century, the early Islamic Neoplatonism which had developed out of Hellenistic philosophy was effectively criticised by al-Ghazali, one of the most influential scholars of Islam. In his works AhƒÅfut al-FalƒÅsifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers), Mizan al-'amal (Criterion of Action) and Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat (The Alchemy of Happiness), he refuted the Philosophy of Ibn Sƒ´nƒÅ, and demonstrated that the Aristotelian ethics is incompatible with Islamic ethics: The latter is based on the belief in God and in life after death, which together provide the foundation of action in the pursuit of sa'ƒÅda (Happiness). =Law= According to Shia Islam, the authority to interpret the messages of the Quran and the Hadith lies with the Imamah, a line of infallible interpreters of the truth. The Sunni majority, however, reject this concept and maintain that God's will has been completely revealed in the Quran and sunnah of the Prophet. The capacity of its interpretation lies with the ulama. By the eleventh century, the major schools of Sunni and Shia law (madhhab) had emerged. Whilst, historically, the schools were at times engaged in mutual conflicts, the differences became less controversial over time, and merely represent regional predominances today. The four most important Sunni schools are: * Shafi'i (Egypt, Mashriq, Hijaz, Yemen) * Maliki (Maghreb and West Africa) * Hanafi (Central and South Asia, the Balkans, Turkey) * Hanbali (most common in the Gulf counties) Shia madhhab include the Ja'fari and Zaidi schools. Minor madhhab also mentioned in the Amman message are the Ibadi and the Zahiri schools. All Sunni madhhabs recognize four sources of sharia (divine law): the Quran, sunnah (authentic hadith), qiyas (analogical reasoning), and ijma (juridical consensus). However, the madhhabs differ from each other in their conception of the Principles of Islamic jurisprudence, or u·π£≈´l al-fiqh, as briefly summarised by Hourani (1991). The Hanbalis only accepted the consensus of the Companions of the Prophet (a·π£-·π£a·∏•ƒÅbah), which gave more leeway to independent reasoning (ijtihad) within the boundaries of the rules of qiyƒÅs. The Hanafis hold that strict analogy may at times be supported by a limited use of juristic preference (istihsan), whereas the Maliki school also allows pragmatic considerations in the interest of public welfare (istislah) are also acceptable. Instead of the Sunni concept of analogy (qiyƒÅs), Shia ulama prefer \\"dialectical reasoning\\" ('Aql) to deduce law. The body of substantive jurisprudence (fiqh) defines the proper way of life through interpretation of sharia, which Muslims should follow if they want to live according to God's will. Over time, the madhhabs established \\"codes of conduct\\", examining human actions in the light of the Quran and Hadith. Supplementing the sharia were customs ( øurf) within a given society. Islamic law and regional customs were not opposed to each other: In 15th century Morocco, qadis were allowed to use a process called  ªamal in order to choose from different juridical opinions one which applied best to the local customs, even if they were not supported by the consensus of the majority. More often, the use of sharia led to changes in local customs. = Theology =  øIlm al-KalƒÅm, the \\"science of discourse\\", also termed \\"Islamic theology\\", serves to explain and defend the doctrine of the Quran and Hadith. The concept of kalƒÅm was introduced during the first Islamic centuries by the Mu øtazila school. One of the most prominent scholars of the Mu øtazila was Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad (935‚Äì1025 AD). From the 11th century on, the Mu øtazila was suppressed by the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate and the Seljuk Empire, but it continued playing an important role in the formation of Shia theology. The Ash'ari school encouraged the use of KalƒÅm as the basis of fiqh, and was followed in this approach by parts of the Shafi'i madhhab. In contrast, the Hanbali and Maliki madhhabs discouraged theological speculation. Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (853‚Äì944 AD) developed his own form of KalƒÅm, differing from the Ash'ari view in the question of Man's free will and God's omnipotence. Maturidi KalƒÅm was often used in combination with Hanafi fiqh in the northwestern parts of the Islamic world. A distinct school of theology often called traditionalist theology emerged under the leadership of Ahmad ibn Hanbal in the early centuries of Islam among hadith scholars who rejected rationalistic argumentation. In the wake of the Ash'arite synthesis between Mu'tazilite rationalism and Hanbalite literalism, its original form survived among a minority of mostly Hanbalite scholars. While Ash'arism and Maturidism are often called the Sunni \\"orthodoxy\\", traditionalist theology has thrived alongside it, laying rival claims to be the orthodox Sunni faith.* Islamic theology experienced further developments among Shia theologians. Cosmopolitan scholarly tradition The study of, and commentaries on Quran and hadith, debates about ijtihad and taqlid and the issuing of fatwa as well as the use of Arabic, and later also Persian as common languages of discourse constituted the religious authority of the ulama throughout the entire Islamic world. Zaman (2010) has demonstrated that, as personal contacts were key to acquiring knowledge, Islamic scholars sometimes travelled far in search of knowledge (·π≠alab al- øilm). Due to their common training and language, any scholars travelling from one region of the Islamic world to another could easily integrate themselves into the local Muslim community and hold offices there: The traveller Ibn Ba·π≠≈´·π≠ah (1304‚Äì1368 or 1369), born in Tangiers, Morocco, to a family of ulema, was appointed qadi by Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of Delhi. Nuruddin ar-Raniri (d. 1658), born to a Gujarati Muslim family, travelled to, and worked as Shaykh ul-Islam in modern-day Indonesia under the protection of Iskandar Thani, Sultan of Aceh. Both scholars were able to move freely in an \\"interconnected world of fellow scholars\\".Zaman (2010), p. 598 According to Zaman, their offices and positions as respected scholars were only questioned if they proved themselves unfamiliar with local customs (as happened to Ibn Ba·π≠≈´·π≠ah]), or met resistance from opponents with stronger local roots (ar-Raniri). Through their travels and teachings, ulama were able to transmit new knowledge and ideas over considerable distances. However, according to Zaman (2010), scholars were often required to rely on commonly known texts which could support their fatwas. A text which might be widely known within the intellectual circles of one region could be unknown in another. The ability of scholars from one region to support their argument in another might therefore be limited by the familiarity with the respective texts of the community they were working in. Likewise, in an era without book print or mass communication media, a scholar's reputation might remain limited if he was unfamiliar with the local canon of texts. As the ijazah, the scholar's approval by another master, was key to the scholar's reputation, the latter would be greater in regions where the approving masters were more widely known. Political and cultural history=Early Muslim communities= The second caliph,  ªUmar ibn al-Kha·π≠·π≠ƒÅb, funded a group of Muslims to study the revelations, stories of Muhammed's life, \\"and other pertinent data, so that when he needed expert advise\\" he could draw it from these \\"people of the bench\\". According to Tamim Ansary, this group evolved into the Ulama =Fiqh= The formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with pragmatic issues of authority and teaching than with theory. Progress in theory began to develop with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi'i (767‚Äì820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book ar-RisƒÅlah. The book details the four roots of law (Qur'an, Sunnah, ijma, and qiyas) while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) must be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.Weiss (2002), p.162 According to Feldman (2008), under many Muslim caliphate states and later states ruled by sultans, the ulama were regarded as the guardians of Islamic law and prevented the Caliph from dictating legal results, with the ruler and ulama forming a sort of \\"separation of powers\\" in government. Laws were decided based on the Ijma (consensus) of the Ummah (community), which was most often represented by the legal scholars. =Early modern Islamic empires= The Sunni Ottoman, and the Shi'a Safavid Persian dynasties, rulers of the two opponent early modern Islamic empires, both relied on ulama in order to legitimise their power. In both empires, ulama patronised by the royal courts created \\"official\\" religious doctrines which supported the dynastic rule. At the high points of their political power, respectively, the development took different paths: The Ottoman Sultan S√ºleyman I successfully integrated the imperial ulama into the imperial bureaucracy, and Ottoman secular law into Islamic law. In contrast, Shah Abbas I of Persia was unable to gain similar support by the Shi'a ulama, who retained a more independent position. During the late Safavid empire, the Shi'a ulama developed into one of the warrantors of continuity in a period of instability of the central government, thus securing a relative independency which they retained during the reign of subsequent dynasties. Ottoman imperial Sunni ulama Seyh-√ºl-Isl√¢m, watercolour, ca. 1809 After the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the leaders and subjects of the Ottoman Empire became increasingly aware of its role as a great power of its time. This new self-awareness was associated with the idea to legitimise the new political role by linking the religious scholarship to the political system: Ottoman historians of the 15th and 16th century like Ibn Zunbul or Eyy√ªb√Æ, described the deeds of the Ottoman sultans in terms of idealised Islamic ghazi warriors. According to Burak (2015), the Ottoman literature genres of the \\"rank order\\" ( and the \\"biografic lexicon\\" () compiled the biographies of scholars in such ways as to create a concise and coherent tradition of the doctrine and structure of the Ottoman imperial scholarship. During the 16th century, scholars like the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm KemƒÅlpa≈üazade (d. 1534), A·∏•mƒÅd b. Mu·π£·π≠afƒÅ Ta≈ük√∂pr√ºzƒÅde (1494‚Äì1561), Kƒ±nalƒ±zƒÅde  øAli √áelebi (d. 1572) and Ali ben Bali (1527‚Äì1584) established a seamless chain of tradition from Abu Hanifa to their own time. Explicitly, some authors stated that their work must not only be understood as the historiography of the Hanafi madhhab, but that it should be consulted in case of eventual disagreements within the school of law. This exemplifies their purpose to establish a canon of Hanafi law within the Ottoman imperial scholarship. which modern Ottomanists termed the \\"Ottoman Islam\\". After 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror (1432‚Äì1481) had established eight madrasas in former Byzantine church buildings, and later founded the sahn-ƒ± ≈üeman or \\"Eight courtyards madrasa\\", adjacent to the Fatih mosque, where he brought together the most distinguished Islamic law scholars of his territory. In his 2015 study on the \\"second formation of Islamic law\\", Burak has shown in detail how the Ottoman state gradually imposed upon the traditional ulama a hierarchy of \\"official imperial scholars\\", appointed and paid by the central government. From the conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo in 1517 onwards, the Ottoman ulama set up their own interpretation of the Sunni Hanafi doctrine which then served as the official religious doctrine of the empire. The formal acknowledgment by decree of the sultan became a prerequisite to issue fatwas. In the 17th century, the annalist al-Hamawi used the expression \\"sultanic mufti\\" (al-ifta' al-sultani) to delineate the difference between the officially appointed religious leaders and those who had followed the traditional way of education., cited after Burak 2015, p. 48 Other authors at that time called the Ottoman law scholars \\"Hanafi of R≈´m [i.e., the Ottoman Empire]\\" (R≈´mi ·∏´ƒÅnƒÅfi), \\"Scholars of R≈´m\\" ( øulamƒÅ'-ƒ± r≈´m) or \\"Scholars of the Ottoman Empire\\" ( øulamƒÅ' al-dawla al- øUthmaniyyƒÅ)., cited after Burak, 2015 The Shaykh al-IslƒÅm () in Istanbul became the highest-ranking Islamic scholar within, and head of the ulama throughout the empire. The ulama in the Ottoman Empire had a significant influence over politics because it was believed that secular institutions were all subordinate to Islamic law, the Sharia (). The ulama were responsible for interpreting the religious law, therefore they claimed that their power superseded that of the government.Inalcik, Halil. 1973. \\"Learning, the Medrese, and the Ulemas.\\" In the Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300‚Äì1600. New York: Praeger, p. 171. Within the Ottoman hierarchy of ulama, the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm held the highest rank. He exerted his influence by issuing fatwas, his written interpretations of the sharia had authority over the entire Ottoman population. In the 16th century, as the support by the ulama of the sultan and the central government was essential for shaping the still-growing empire, the importance of the office rose, and its power increased. As members of the Ilmiye, the imperial scholars were part of the Ottoman elite class of the Askeri, and were exempt from any taxes. However, by approving scholars and appointing them to offices, over time the sultan's influence increased over the religious scholars, although, as a Muslim, he still stood under the Islamic law. Even the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm was subordinate to the sultan; his position, like the ranks of the muftis, was described as a \\"service\\" () or \\"rank\\" ( or paye-ƒ± Sahn), to which a candidate was appointed or elevated. Sometimes, the sultans made use of their power: In 1633, Murad IV gave order to execute the Shaykh al-IslƒÅm Ahƒ´zƒÅde ·∏§√ºseyin Efendi. In 1656, Shaykh al-IslƒÅm ·∏§ocazƒÅde Mes øud Efendi was sentenced to death by sultan Mehmed IV. The use of the Sunni Islam as a legitimisation of the Ottoman dynastic rule is closely linked to Sultan S√ºleyman I and his kazasker and later Schaykh al-IslƒÅm Ebussuud Efendi. Ebussuud compiled an imperial book of law (·∏≥ƒÅn≈´n-nƒÅme), which combined religious law (sharƒ´ øah) with secular dynastic law (·∏≥ƒÅn≈´n) in the person of the sultan. For example, Ebussuud provided a reason why the government could own land, or could levy and increase taxes, as the government was responsible for the protection of the common good of all Muslims. Shi'a state religion of Safavid Persia Shaikh ·π¢ƒÅfƒ´ ad-Dƒ´n Is·∏•ƒÅq Ardabƒ´lƒ´ (1252‚Äì1334) was the founder of the Safaviyya tariqa. Safi ad-Din's great-great grandson Ismail, who from 1501 onwards ruled over the Persian Empire, was the founder of the Safavid dynasty. Shah Ismail I proclaimed the Twelver Shi'a as the new Persian state religion. To propagate the Safavid faith, he invited ulama from Qom, Jabal 'ƒÄmil in southern Lebanon and Syria to travel around Iran and promote the Shi'a doctrine. In 1533, Shah Tahmasp I commissioned a new edition of the Safvat as-safa, Shaikh ·π¢ƒÅfƒ´'s genealogy. It was rewritten in order to support the royal family's claim at descendency from Musa al-Kadhim, the Seventh Imam, and thus to legitimise the Safavid rule. During the reign of Shah Abbas I (1571 ‚Äì 1629 AD), the argument of the theocratic unity of religious and political power was no longer sufficient to legitimise the Shah's authority: Shi'a ulama renounced the monarch's claim to represent the hidden Imam by teaching that descendancy did not necessarily mean representation. Likewise, as the influence of Sufi mysticism weakened, the Shah's role as the head of the Safaviyya lost its significance as a justification for his political role. Abbas I thus sought to associate himself with eminent ulama like Shaykh BahƒÅ æi (1574‚Äì1621 AD), whom he made Shaykh al-IslƒÅm in his new capital, Isfahan. Other famous ulama working under Abbas's patronage were Mir Damad (d. 1631 or 1632 AD), one of the founders of the School of Isfahan, and Ahmad ibn Muhammad Ardabili (d. 1585). By their teachings, they further developed the Shi'a Islamic teachings and religious practice. However, as religion did no longer suffice to support political power in Persia, Abbas I had to develop independent concepts to legitimise his rule. He did so by creating a new \\"ghulam\\" army, thus evoking the Turco-Mongol tradition of Timur and his reign. =19th century=New Ottoman scholarly elite By the beginning of the 19th century, the Ottoman ulama still retained their political influence. When sultan Selim III tried to reform the Ottoman army, the ulama opposed his plans, which they rejected as an apostasy from Islam. Consequently, his reform failed. However, Selims successor Mahmud II (r. 1808‚Äì1839) was more successful: He called the new troops, organised according to European models, by the name \\"Victorious army of Muhammad\\" (As√¢kir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye). By doing so, he was able to overcome the accusation of apostasy and secure the ulama's support. Mahmuds reforms created a new imperial elite class who spoke Western European languages and were knowledgeable of the Western European societies and their political systems. As the political and economic pressure increased on the Ottoman Empire in the course of the 19th century, this new elite carried on the Sultan's reforms and helped initiating a new era of reform, the Tanzimat. In parallel, the political influence of the ulama was circumvented and reduced step by step. A ministry for religious endowments was created in order to control the finances of the vakƒ±f. Thus, the ulama lost direct control over their finances, which significantly reduced their capacity to exert political influence. Orthodox Shi'a ulama in post-Safavid and Qajar Iran Iranian Shaykh ul-Islam Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (1627‚Äì1699) In Iran, a period of political instability began with the collapse of the Safavid reign after shah Sultan Husayns death in 1722. In the light of the discontinuity and fragmentation of the central government, two social groups maintained continuity and, consequently, rose in power: Tribal chieftains established, amongst others, the Khanates of the Caucasus, the Afsharid and Zand dynasties. The second group who benefitted from the weakness of the central authority was the Shi'a ulama. According to Garthwaite (2010), \\"the ulama constituted one institution that not only provided continuity, but gradually asserted its role over and against royal authority.\\" A process of change began which continued throughout the 19th century and into the present. Already some of the last Safavids, Sulayman Shah (r. 1666‚Äì1694) and Tahmasp II (r. 1722‚Äì1732) had sought the ulama's support in an attempt to strengthen their authority. Particularly, they associated themselves with a group of ulama who supported the \\"official\\" Twelver Shi'a doctrine, established by the Iranian Shaykh al- IslƒÅm Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi (1627‚Äì1699) during the later decades of Safavid rule. The dispute between the Twelver Shi'a and Mir Damad's (d. 1631 or 1632) and ·π¢adr ad-Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Shƒ´rƒÅzƒ´'s (c. 1571/2 ‚Äì 1640) School of Isfahan, who promoted Sufi mysticism and Islamic philosophy, continued throughout the 18th century, and shaped the relationship between ulama and government during the reigns of the subsequent dynasties. With the accession of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar to the Iranian throne, the Qajar dynasty consolidated the central power. However, the Qajar Shahs, in particular Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848‚Äì1896), whose reign paralleled that of the Ottoman Sultans of the Tanzimat time, failed at obtaining central control over the ulama. The Shiite scholars retained their political influence on the Persian society. They also maintained unrestricted access to the financial resources from the religious endowments. In addition, the Islamic Zakat tax was paid to individual imams and not to state-sponsored tax collectors. Both their religious influence and their financial means allowed the Shiite ulama to act, at times, against the Shah. Thus, under the Qajar dynasty, the ulama provided a source of religious legitimacy and served as interpreters of religious law in a dual legal system where the state administered law based on custom ( ªurf). =19th/20th century: Ulama and Muslim reform=Reformers and concepts Starting in the first half of the 19th century, direct contacts began and gradually increased between members of the ulama and modern Western Europe. The Egyptian alim Rifa'a al-Tahtawi (1801‚Äì1873) was amongst the first members of the ulama who travelled to Europe. As a religious counsellor to a delegation by the Egyptian khedive Muhammad Ali Pasha he stayed in Paris from 1826 to 1831. His report \\"The Extraction of Gold or an Overview of Paris\\" (Ta·∏´lƒ´·π£ al-ibrƒ´z fƒ´ tal·∏´ƒ´·π£ BƒÅrƒ´z) (1849) included some outlines of future reforms and potential improvements in his native country. Although al-Tahtawi had gone through the traditional education of an alim, his interest focused on modern French concepts of administration and economy. He only referred to Islam in order to emphasize that Muslims can adopt practical knowledge and insights from Europe. As such, at-Tahtawis report reflects the political efforts of Muhammad Ali Pasha, who did not intend to reform al-Azhar university, but aimed at building an independent educational system sponsored by his government. Hayreddin Pasha (1822/3‚Äì1890) was an Ottoman Tunisian alim and statesman who reformed the administration and jurisdiction of the province. He was able to explain his ideas in French (R√©formes n√©cessaires aux √âtats musulmans ‚Äì Necessary reforms of the Muslim states. Paris, 1868), which he had learned whilst representing his sovereign Ahmad Bey at the court of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1855. In contrast to al-Tahtawi, Hayreddin Pasha used the religious concept of the Muslim collective interest (ma·π£la·∏•a) to make his point, thereby applying the idea of ijtihad to public affairs. Positions comparable to the Western Islamic ulama were also taken in the Eastern parts of the Islamic world by Syed Ahmad Khan, the pioneering Muslim modernist in South Asia, and JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al- AfghƒÅnƒ´. The latter is regarded as the mentor of Pan-Islamism, but also as one of the founders of the political Islam and of the late 19th and 20th century Salafi movement. The Egyptian Grand Mufti Mu·∏•ammad  øAbduh (1849‚Äì1905), who was granted the degree of 'Alim by al-Azhar university in 1877, was the first who used the term IslƒÅh in order to denote political and religious reforms. Until 1887 he edited together with al-AfghƒÅnƒ´ the newspaper al- øUrwa al-WuthqƒÅ (\\"The firm bond\\"). The gazette widely spread the pan-islamistic concept of Islam representing a religious bond which was believed to be stronger than nationality or language. From 1876 on,  øAbduh edited the newspaper al-AhrƒÅm. Since 1898, he also edited, together with Rashƒ´d RidƒÅ (1865‚Äì1935), the newspaper al-ManƒÅr (\\"The Beacon\\"), in which he further developed his ideas. al-ManƒÅr appeared in print for almost 40 years and was read throughout the Islamic world.  øAbduh understood Islah as a concept of \\"reform of mankind\\" (i·π£lƒÅ·∏• nau ø al-insƒÅn).Merad: Article \\"I·π£lƒÅ·∏•. 1. The Arab World\\" in EI¬≤ Vol. IV. p. 144a. In his works, he emphasized the special importance of a reform of the traditional madrasa system, which was taken to disadvantage by the parallel establishment of the secular, state-sponsored educational system in Egypt. He strove at reconciling the traditional and modern educational systems, thereby justifying from the point of view of Islam the introduction of modern institutions by the national state. He referred to the Islamic concept of the collective interest or common good of the Muslim community (ma·π£la·∏•a), to which he accorded overarching importance (al-ma·π£la·∏•a shar) in the interest of his fellow Muslims. The concept of islƒÅh gained special relevance for the future, as it strives at understanding and justifying all aspects of modern life from the Islamic doctrine. After  øAbduhs death in 1905, Rashƒ´d RidƒÅ continued editing \\"al-ManƒÅr\\" on his own. In 1924, he published a collection of writings by some ulama of Najd: Ma«ßm≈´ øat al-·∏•adi·π≠ an- na«ßdƒ´ya.Cairo, Ma·π≠b. al-ManƒÅr, 1342/1924 Thus, the teachings of the Yemeni alim Muhammad ash-Shawkani (1759‚Äì1839), which had already been discussed since the 1880s, gained greater publicity. Likewise, the writings of the Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyyah (1263‚Äì1328) came to attention again. Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrine provided a link between the wahhabiyya and parts of the salafiyya movements. The theological differences between the two movements were altogether too large for a complete union of the two doctrines. However, the opening of the Salafi movement towards Wahhabism helped to reconcile the latter with the Islamic public after king Ibn Saud's invasion of the Hijaz in 1924. Central Arabian militia (I·∏´wƒÅn) had occupied and looted the holy towns of Mecca and Medina, thereby destroying monuments which they considered pagan (\\"shirk\\"). Starting with the Pan-Islamic Congress in Mecca in 1926, the pro- Saudi movement developed into one of the most relevant currents of Islamic thought. In his Egyptian exile, the Syrian alim  øAbd ar-RahmƒÅn al-KawƒÅkibƒ´ (1854‚Äì1902) met al-AfghƒÅnƒ´,  øAbduh and RidƒÅ. In his books ·π¨abƒÅ æi ø al-istibdƒÅd (\\"The nature of despotism\\") and Umm al-QurƒÅ (\\"Mother of villages [i.e., Mecca]\\", 1899) he accused the Ottoman sultan Abd√ºlhamid II of corrupting the Islamic community. The Ottoman despotism \\"encroaches on the rights of its citizens, keeps them ignorant to keep them passive, [and] denies their right to take an active part in human life\\".Al-KawƒÅkibƒ´'s thoughts are cited as summarised in* Therefore, the law must be reformed. By the use of ijtihad, a \\"modern and unified system of law\\" must be created, and \\"proper religious education\\" must be provided. Because of the central position of the Arabic peoples in the ummah and the Arabic language in the intellectual discourse, but also because \\"Arabian Islam is ... free from modern corruptions and the bedouin are free from the moral decay and passivity of despotism\\", the balance of power must shift from the Turks towards the Arabs. The Ottoman dynasty must give up their claim to the caliphate, and a new caliph of Quraysh descent must be elected by representatives of the ummah. His temporal authority would be set up in the Hejaz, whilst he would hold religious authority over the entire Muslim community, \\"assisted ... by a consultative council nominated by the Muslim rulers\\". Al-KawƒÅkibƒ´s idea that the Arabian doctrine represented a more puristic form of the Islam, according to Cleveland and Bunton (2016), prepared the ground for the 20th century Arab nationalism as well as the Islamic renewal movement of the Nahda. Muslim mass organizations In 1912, the Muhammadiyah organization was founded in Yogyakarta, which, together with Nahdlatul Ulama (\\"Reawakening of the ulama\\"), founded in 1926, form the two largest Muslim organizations in the world. Since the 1930s, their religious boarding schools (\\"pesantren\\") also taught mathematics, natural sciences, English and history. Since the 1980, the Nahdlatul Ulama schools also offered degrees in economy, jurisdiction, paedagogical and medical sciences. In the 1990s, under their leader Abdurrahman Wahid, the organization adopted an anti- fundamentalistic doctrine, teaching democracy and pluralism. Darul Uloom Deoband, next to al-Azhar one of the most influential madrasas, was founded in the city of Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, in 1867. Initially, the intention of the school was to help Indian Muslims, who had become subjects of the British Empire after 1857, to lead their lives according to Islamic law. The Deobandi propagate a Sunni Islam of the Hanafi school, which was the most prevalent madhhab in South Asia. Still today, they aim at a revival of the Islamic society and education. Following the example of Deoband, thousands of madrasas were founded during the late 19th century which adopted the Deobandi way of studying fundamental texts of Islam and commenting on Quran and Hadith. By referring back to traditional Islamic scholars, the Deobandi School aims at defending the traditional Islamic madhhab, especially the Hanafi, against criticism which arose from other Islamic schools like the Ahl-i Hadith. During the 1990s, the Afghan taliban also referred to the Deoband School. Ashraf Ali Thanwi (1863‚Äì1943) is one of the most prominent teachers of Darul Uloom Deoband. Thanwi initiated and edited multi-volume encyclopedic commentaries on the Quran. However, he was also able to reach out to a larger audience: His book Bahishti Zewar, which is still widely read in South Asia, as it details, amongst other topics, the proper conduct and beliefs for Muslim women. Ahl-i Hadith is a movement which emerged in North India in the mid-19th century. By rejecting taqlid (following legal precedent) and favoring ijtihad (independent legal reasoning) based on the foundational scriptures of Islam, they oppose the traditional madhhab and criticize their reliance on legal authorities other than the traditional texts. The Ahl-i Hadith was the first organization which printed and spread the works of Muhammad ash-Shawkani, whose writings did also influence the doctrine of the Salafi movement in the Arab Middle East and worldwide. Muslim World League is an international non-governmental Islamic organization based in Mecca, Saudi Arabia that is a member of UNICEF, UNESCO and OIC. It aims to resolve the issues faced by the Islamic community by organizing scholarly conferences with the Ulama around the world in order to form public Islamic opinions based on principles of moderation, peace and harmony. =Ulama in the secular national states of the 20th century= In most countries, the classical institution of the madrasa as a place of teaching remained largely intact until the beginning of the 20th century. In the Western parts of the Islamic world, national states arose from the disintegration and partition of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The government of Kemalist Turkey sought to distance the nation from the religious traditions and institutions of the Ottoman past. In Egypt, the establishment of a state-controlled educational system had already begun in the 1820s. From 1961 onwards, Gamal Abdel Nasser tried to increase the state control over ancient Islamic institutions like al-Azhar university. The head of al-Azhar was ‚Äì and still is ‚Äì appointed directly by the president, and new faculties were created in this ancient Islamic institution. Initially giving rise to modernist reforms, up to a certain degree the state-sponsored faculties were able to retain their independence from government control. However, as Pierret has pointed out in detail for Syria, in some countries the orthodox madrasa system remained largely intact, its decentralised organisation protecting it from state control. In fact, the government's attempt at controlling the religious education focussed largely on the academic institutions and neglected the traditional madrasas. By their continuing ability to provide social support and access to an educational alternative which was propagated as being more orthodox according to Islamic faith, the traditional ulama not only maintained their influence on large parts of the population, but actually increased their political influence and power. Republic of Turkey In the Kemalist Republic of Turkey, traditional Ottoman religious institutions were abolished like the Ottoman Caliphate, the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam, as well as the dervish brotherhoods. The Presidency of Religious Affairs (, or Diyanet) was created in 1924 by article 136 of the Constitution of Turkey by the Grand National Assembly of Turkey as a successor to the office of the Shaykh ul-Islam. From 1925 onwards, the traditional dervish tekkes and Islamic schools were dissolved. Famous convents like the Tekke of the Mevlevi order in Konya were secularized and turned into museums.Law Nr. 677 of 30 November 1925 concerning the prohibition and the closure of the dervish convents, monasteries and mausolea, the prohibition of the office of the mausoleum wardens and the awarding and holding of certain titles. T.C. Resmi Gazete Nr 243, 13 December 1925. Iran In Iran, contrary to many other Islamic countries, the Shi'a ulama had maintained their religious authority together with considerable sources of income by waqf endowments and the zakat tax. Thus, they maintained their ability to exert political pressure. Between 1905 and 1911, a coalition of ulama, bazaari, and some radical reformers incited the Persian Constitutional Revolution, which led to the establishment of the parliament (majlis) of Iran during the Qajar Dynasty. The Islamic Revolution in Iran was led by a senior Shia cleric‚Äîthe Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini‚Äîwho established an Islamic Republic whose constitution calls for a cleric as the country's Supreme Ruler. Syria In his study on \\"Religion and state in Syria\\" (2013), Pierret pointed out how the training of Syria's ulama gradually became more institutionalised, based upon the traditional madrasa system: In 1920, the madrasa of the Khusruwiyah Mosque complex (which was to be destroyed in 2014 during the Syrian Civil War) introduced an entrance exam and a stable curriculum for its Islamic seminary. Graduates were issued a diploma carrying the name of the institution, which bore the signatures of all teachers, signifying individual ijazah. In 1947, courses also included natural sciences and foreign languages. In 1947, the state-run \\"Faculty of Sharia\\" was initiated in Damascus by Kamal al-Qassab (1853‚Äì1954), a former student of Mu·∏•ammad  øAbduh (1849‚Äì1905) in Cairo. Until 1954, all Syrian ulama aiming at higher degrees had to join Al-Azhar University in Cairo. In 1954, however, Syria's first higher faculty of sharia was founded by members of the modernist wing of the Muslim Brotherhood. Its curriculum, which included economy and the \\"current situation of the Muslim world\\", according to Pierret, \\"anticipated the 1961 modernist reform of al-Azhar by Nasser\\". In 1972, the curriculum of the state-run \\"Sharia high schools\\" was reformed again, thus providing access for their students to all faculties of Syrian high schools. According to Pierret (2015), the Ba'ath Party coup of 1963 brought about a weakening of the state-controlled sharia high schools by the secular government. Many teachers of the Damascus faculty of sharia were forced into exile during the 1960s. Attempts of the regime during the 1980s at changing the curricula of the faculty and create a new \\"Ba'athist ulama\\" failed. The faculty, maintaining their ability to recruit competent teachers, was able to resist the political pressure. Consequently, the Syrian government prohibited the faculty to grant doctorates until 1998, and delayed the establishment of another faculty in Aleppo until 2006. Tunisia, Egypt, Iraq In 1961, Gamal Abdel Nasser put the Al-Azhar University under the direct control of the state. \\"Azharis were given military uniforms and found themselves marching in step under the orders of army officers.\\" After the independence of Algeria, President Ahmed Ben Bella also deprived the Algerian ulama of their power. Baathist repression in Iraq led to a drop of enrollment in the Shia holy cities of Iraq from 12,000 students in the early 1900s to only 600 scholars and students in 1977. Pakistan When in the 1980s and 1990s the inner-Islamic conflict escalated in Pakistan between Sunnite and Shiite sectarians, Islamic organizations represented the religious and political frontiers, and spread their ideas in the madrasas which they sponsored. Graduates (talib) from North Pakistani madrasas like \\"Mullah\\" Mohammed Omar played a role in the establishment of the Afghan Taliban regime as well as in the development of the radical Islamic terrorism. Under the pressure of Islamic terrorism, the traditional Islamic educational system together with their ulama came into general disregard within the Western world. =Islamic revival and the origin of extremism= Quran studies class in the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore Islam, unlike Christianity, does not know a centralised process of ordination of its clergy. The traditional way of education and training relied largely on personal relationships between a teacher and his students. Whenever Islamic national governments tried to influence their regional ulama, they did so by controlling their income, or by establishing state-controlled schools and high schools. Traditional madrasas, representing merely decentralised \\"places of learning\\" and not institutions comparable to Western universities, often remained beyond state control. Whenever the state failed to control the resources of the madrasas, e.g., by controlling the income from religious endowments, or collecting Muslim taxes on behalf of the clergy, the ulama also retained the independence of their teaching. In particular, this held to be true in the Arabian provinces of the Ottoman Empire and the Arabian national states which arose out of the empire after the First World War. For many people living in the poorer Islamic countries of today, especially those without natural resources like petroleum, the madrasa system, privately sponsored by foreign aid and not or insufficiently controlled by the state, often constitutes their only access to some form of education and social rise. Saudi Arabian humanitarian organizations use the madrasas they sponsor to spread their wahhabitic doctrine, whilst Shiite madrasas are frequently influenced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Islamic revival originated largely from institutions which were financially independent from the state, and beyond its control. This led to a resurgence of the social and political influence of the traditional ulama in at least some countries. Insufficient state control over the educational institutions and the frequently insufficient qualification of the teachers remain an issue, as does the ideologic indoctrination and the future professional perspectives of the graduates. Modern challenges Some opinions from within the Muslim world have criticized the lack of scientific training of the ulama, and argued that those proficient in the sciences should qualify for this title. In Egypt, the Al-Azhar University has begun to introduce scientific and practical subjects in its traditional theological colleges to help the ulama face the challenges of the modern world. N.

The gorge is the site of the Cheddar show caves, where Britain's oldest complete human skeleton, Cheddar Man, estimated to be 9,000 years old, was found in 1903. Older remains from the Upper Late Palaeolithic era (12,000‚Äì13,000 years ago) have been found. The caves, produced by the activity of an underground river, contain stalactites and stalagmites. The gorge is part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest called Cheddar Complex. Cheddar Gorge, including the caves and other attractions, has become a tourist destination. In a 2005 poll of Radio Times readers, following its appearance on the television programme Seven Natural Wonders (2005), Cheddar Gorge was named as the second greatest natural wonder in Britain, surpassed only by Dan yr Ogof caves. The gorge attracts about 500,000 visitors per year.  Geology  Aerial photograph, showing the cliff faces to the south (right hand side of picture) and the slopes to the north. Cheddar is a gorge lying on the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The maximum depth of the gorge is , with a near-vertical cliff-face to the south, and steep grassy slopes to the north. The B3135 road runs along the bottom of the gorge. The area is underlain by Black Rock slate, Burrington Oolite and Clifton Down Limestone of the Carboniferous Limestone Series, which contain ooliths and fossil debris, on top of Old Red Sandstone and by dolomitic conglomerate of the Keuper. Evidence for Variscan orogeny is seen in the sheared rock and cleaved shales. In many places weathering of these strata has resulted in the formation of immature calcareous soils. The gorge was formed by meltwater floods during the cold periglacial periods which have occurred over the last 1.2 million years. During the ice ages, permafrost blocked the caves with ice and frozen mud and made the limestone impermeable. When this melted during the summers, water was forced to flow on the surface, and carved out the gorge. During warmer periods, the water flowed underground through the permeable limestone, creating the caves and leaving the gorge dry, so that today much of the gorge has no river until the underground Cheddar Yeo river emerges in the lower part from Gough's Cave. The river is used by Bristol Water, who maintain a series of dams and ponds which supply the nearby Cheddar Reservoir, via a diameter pipe that takes water just upstream of the Rotary Club Sensory Garden, a public park in the gorge opposite Jacob's Ladder. The gorge is susceptible to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968, the flow of water washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave and washing away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.  Ownership  The south side of the gorge is owned and administered by the Marquess of Bath's Longleat Estate. The cliffs on the north side of the gorge are owned by The National Trust. Every year, both of the gorge's owners contribute funds towards the clearance of scrub, bush and trees from the area. Most of the commercial visitor activity in the gorge is on the Longleat-owned south side, including access to the two main commercial show caves and the visitor centre, which is operated by Longleat-owned company Cheddar Gorge and Caves Ltd under director Hugh Cornwell. Because visitors to the show caves have decreased from 400,000 a year in the 1980s to 150,000 in 2013, Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, who runs the Longleat estate on behalf of the family trust, proposed the installation of a 18-gondola cable car at an estimated cost of ¬£10m, which would take visitors from the entrance area to the caves directly to the top of the southside cliffs. The National Trust opposed the proposed development, stating that it would spoil the view and cheapen the experience, creating a \\"fairground ride\\" that would make the area feel more like an amusement park. Planning permission was planned in Spring 2014, which would have meant that operations would start in Spring 2016. In 2015 the financial feasibility was still being investigated.  Ecology  A goat in the gorge Notable species at the gorge include dormice, yellow-necked mice, slowworms and adders and the rare large blue butterfly (Maculinea arion), and small pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene). A wide variety of wild birds may be seen in Cheddar Gorge including peregrine falcon, buzzard, kestrel, raven and grasshopper warbler. The flora include chalk grassland-loving species such as marjoram and wild thyme. The Cheddar pink, Dianthus gratianopolitanus, also known as firewitch, only grows in the wild in the gorge. It was once common in the gorge but declined after being picked by collectors. It is also home to unique species of whitebeam. The nationally rare little robin geranium (Geranium purpureum), and Cheddar bedstraw (Galium fleurotii) and the nationally scarce species include slender tare (Vicia tenuissima), dwarf mouse-ear (Cerastium pumilum) and rock stonecrop (Sedum forsteranum) also occur in the gorge. It is one of the few localities in England with native populations of the Welsh poppy Papaver cambricum. It is one of the very few areas in southern Britain where the lichens Solorina saccata, Squamaria cartilaginea and Caloplaca cirrochroa can be found. The gorge is also an important site for whitebeams and in 2009 a survey was carried out by botanists from the Welsh National Herbarium as part of a nationwide survey of whitebeams. Among the eight species identified were three new species previously unknown to science. Nineteen specimens with oval-shaped leaves were named the \\"Cheddar whitebeam\\", Sorbus cheddarensis, fifteen specimens with roundish leaves and greyish brown bark were named the \\"Twin Cliffs whitebeam\\", Sorbus eminentoides, and thirteen with long, narrow leaves were named \\"Gough‚Äôs Rock whitebeam\\", Sorbus rupicoloides. The Cheddar whitebeam, which has evolved as a cross between the common whitebeam and the grey-leaved whitebeam, is unique to the gorge, but its survival is threatened by the goats that were introduced specifically to keep down the growth of new trees and encourage the proliferation of rare plant species such as the Cheddar pink. Cuttings have been taken from the trees to be grafted and grown on at the Welsh National Herbarium.Country File, Produced by Andrea Buffery, Babara Lewis and Andrew Tomlinson: Broadcast 22 February 2010: BBC Television Longleat Estate has fenced off a large part of its land and has introduced goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. There is already a small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.  Caves  Stalagmites and stalactites in Gough's Cave The two main caves open to the public are on the southside of the Gorge, owned by Longleat Estate. The extensive Gough's Cave and the smaller Cox's Cave are both named after their respective discoverers. Both are known for their geology, and it has been suggested that the caves were used for maturing cheese in prehistoric times. Gough's cave, which was discovered in 1903, leads around into the rock-face, and contains a variety of large rock chambers and formations. Cox's Cave, discovered in 1837, is smaller but contains many intricate formations. In 2016 Cox's cave was turned into \\"Dreamhunters\\", a multimedia walk-through experience with theatrical lighting and video projection. The Gorge's many caves are home to colonies of Greater and Lesser horseshoe bats. In 1999, the Channel 4 television programme Time Team investigated Cooper's Hole in an attempt to find evidence of Palaeolithic human activity. These caves are the inspirations for the caves behind Helm's Deep in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Two Towers. Several of the caves have been scheduled as ancient monuments as nationally important archaeological sites including: Gough's Old Cave, Great Oone's Hole, Saye's Hole, Soldier's Hole and Sun Hole.  Recreational use  Exposed limestone cliffs above visitor centre and restaurant Cliff Road (B3135), which runs through the Gorge, offers a popular climb for bicyclists and has a maximum gradient of 16%. The ascent featured in stage 6 of the 2011 Tour of Britain. There are about 590 graded rock climbing routes on the South side of the gorge, which are generally open to climbers between 1 October and 15 March each year. The North side of the gorge has about 380 climbing routes and the land is predominantly owned by the National Trust and mapped as Open Access land which give a right of access for climbers all year. Each of the routes is named and included in the British Mountaineering Council guidebook. Although the majority of the climbs are \\"trad\\" or \\"traditional\\", which means that the leader places protection as they go up, there are also some \\"sport\\" routes where bolts are left in place. Climber Chris Bonington was the first to scale the Coronation Street route in 1965. Visitors to the gorge have experienced a number of accidents. Rescue services, including local mountain rescue and cave rescue groups, frequently use the gorge to stage exercises. It is also used as a training location for military rescue helicopter pilots. The Cheddar Man Museum of Prehistory inspired by the discovery of ancient hominids such as Cheddar Man contains information about the caves and their palaeontological development. Exhibits include original flint tools and human remains excavated from the caves. The Visitors' Centre and Restaurant is an important Modernist design by Geoffrey Jellicoe, dating from 1934. Jellicoe was commissioned by the fifth Marquess of Bath, and created a two-block structure with a roof-top pool. He drew inspiration from International Modernist buildings, including the De La Warr Pavilion. The integrity of the building has been greatly compromised. In the 1960s, the glass roof to the restaurant, and the pool set above it, were removed to increase seating capacity, and it has since been re-clad in poor quality materials. Michael Spens, in his comprehensive study, The Complete Landscape Designs and Gardens of Geoffrey Jellicoe, writes that it is \\"now barely recognizable as a pioneer construction of the modern period\\". There is a clifftop walk from Jacob's Ladder along the crest of the gorge and back to the road, with views of the gorge. A caving experience is offered within Gough's Cave. There is a path of 275 steps, built up the side of the gorge, known as Jacob's Ladder after the Biblical description of a ladder to the heavens. A watchtower at the top provides a 360‚Äìdegree view of the entire area and village. An open-top bus tour operates during the summer. Cheddar cheese is made in the lower part of the gorge.

Cheddar Gorge was the setting for Peter Nichols' comedy The Gorge (1968), in the BBC's Wednesday Play series. Cheddar Gorge is a panel game played on the BBC Radio 4 series I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. The gorge was used as a location for a Chimeran Tower in the Resistance: Fall of Man, a science fiction first-person shooter video game for the PlayStation 3, developed by Insomniac Games. Cheddar Gorge was the site of Into the Labyrinth starring Ron Moody and Pamela Salem. Cheddar George was the name of a mouse in The Beano Comic. The gorge was the inspiration for J. R. R.

It is the third film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace and his dog Gromit, following A Grand Day Out (1989) and The Wrong Trousers (1993). In A Close Shave, Wallace and Gromit uncover a plot to rustle sheep by a sinister dog. Like The Wrong Trousers, it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.A Close Shave has the first appearance of the character Shaun, who would later be the protagonist of the Shaun the Sheep spin off television series, and two feature films.  Plot  Inventor Wallace and his dog Gromit operate a window cleaning business. Wallace falls for wool shopkeeper Wendolene Ramsbottom; her sinister dog, Preston, who rustles sheep to supply the shop. After a lost sheep wanders into the house, Wallace places him in his Knit-o-Matic, which shears sheep and knits the wool into jumpers, and names him Shaun. Preston steals the Knit-o- Matic blueprints. While Gromit investigates Preston, Preston captures him and frames him for the sheep rustling. Gromit is arrested and imprisoned, while Wallace's house is inundated with sheep. Wallace and the sheep rescue Gromit and hide out in the fields. Wendolene and Preston arrive in the lorry to round up the sheep. When Wendolene demands Preston stop the rustling, he locks her in the lorry with the sheep and drives away, intent on turning them into dog food. Wallace and Gromit chases on their motorcycle. When Gromit's sidecar detaches, he activates it's aeroplane mode and resumes the chase from the air. Wallace becomes trapped in the lorry and he, Wendolene and the sheep are transported to Preston's factory, where Preston has built an enormous Knit-o- Matic. The captives are loaded into the wash basin, but Shaun escapes. Shaun activates neon signs to reveal the factory's location to Gromit, who attacks Preston. Shaun sucks Preston into the Knit-o-Matic, removing his fur. Wendolene reveals that Preston is actually a robot created by her inventor father for good, but became evil. When the Knit-o-Matic dresses Preston in a sweater made of his fur, he inadvertently hits the controls, and the group become poised to fall into the mincing machine. Shaun pushes Preston into the machine, crushing him. Gromit is exonerated and Wallace rebuilds Preston as a harmless remote controlled dog. When Wendolene visits, Wallace invites her to eat cheese, but she declines, saying that she is allergic. As Wallace decides to help himself, he finds Shaun eating the cheese, to his chagrin.

Her career has spanned almost eight decades, much of it in the United States. Her work has received international attention. She is recognised as the earliest surviving Academy Award nominee and one of the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. Lansbury was born to Irish actress Moyna Macgill and British politician Edgar Lansbury, an upper-middle-class family in Regent's Park, central London. To escape the Blitz, in 1940 she moved to the United States with her mother and two brothers, and she studied acting in New York City. Proceeding to Hollywood in 1942, she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and obtained her first film roles, in Gaslight (1944) and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), earning her two Oscar nominations and a Golden Globe Award. She appeared in eleven further films for MGM, mostly in supporting roles such as National Velvet (1944), and The Harvey Girls. After her contract ended in 1952 she began supplementing her cinematic work with theatrical appearances. Although largely seen as a B-list star during this period, her appearance in the film The Manchurian Candidate (1962) received widespread acclaim, was cited as being one of her finest performances and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Moving into musical theater, Lansbury finally gained stardom for playing the leading role in the Broadway musical Mame (1966), which earned her a range of awards. Amid difficulties in her personal life, Lansbury moved from California to County Cork, Ireland in 1970, and continued with her theatrical and cinematic appearances throughout the decade including starring in Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) and the stage musicals Gypsy, Sweeney Todd, and The King and I. Moving into television, she achieved worldwide fame as fictional writer and sleuth Jessica Fletcher in the American whodunit series Murder, She Wrote, which ran for twelve seasons from 1984 until 1996, becoming one of the longest-running detective drama series in television history. Through Corymore Productions, a company that she co-owned with her husband Peter Shaw, Lansbury assumed ownership of the series and was its executive producer for the final four seasons. Since then, she has toured in a variety of international theatrical productions and continued to make occasional appearances in films including Beauty and the Beast (1991), Nanny McPhee (2005) and Mary Poppins Returns (2018). Lansbury has received an Honorary Oscar and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) and has won five Tony Awards, six Golden Globes, and an Olivier Award. She has also been nominated for numerous other industry awards, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress on three occasions, and various Primetime Emmy Awards on eighteen occasions, and a Grammy Award. In 2014, Lansbury was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II. She has been the subject of three biographies. Early life and childhood Lansbury was born to an upper middle class family on October 16, 1925. Although her birthplace has often been given as Poplar, East London, she has rejected this, asserting that while she had ancestral connections to Poplar, she was born in Regent's Park, Central London. \\"I want to make one thing clear: I was not born in Poplar, that's not true, I was born in Regent's Park, so I wasn't born in the East End, I wish I could say I had been. Certainly my antecedents were: my grandfather, my father.\\" (mins 3‚Äì4) Her mother was Belfast-born actress Moyna MacGill (born Charlotte Lillian McIldowie), who regularly appeared on stage in the West End and who had also starred in several films. Her father was the wealthy English timber merchant and politician Edgar Lansbury, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and former mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Poplar. Her paternal grandfather was the Labour Party leader and anti-war activist George Lansbury, a man whom she felt \\"awed\\" by and considered \\"a giant in my youth.\\" Angela had an older half sister, Isolde, who was the daughter of Moyna's previous marriage to writer and director Reginald Denham. In January 1930, when Angela was four, her mother gave birth to twin boys, Bruce and Edgar, leading the Lansburys to move from their Poplar flat to a house in Mill Hill, North London; on weekends they would vacate to a rural farm in Berrick Salome, near Wallingford, Oxfordshire. When Lansbury was nine, her father died from stomach cancer; she retreated into playing characters as a coping mechanism. Facing financial difficulty, her mother became engaged to a Scottish colonel, Leckie Forbes, and moved into his house in Hampstead, with Lansbury receiving an education at South Hampstead High School from 1934 until 1939. She nevertheless considered herself largely self-educated, learning from books, theatre and cinema. She became a self-professed \\"complete movie maniac\\", visiting the cinema regularly and imagining herself as certain characters. Keen on playing the piano, she briefly studied music at the Ritman School of Dancing, and in 1940 began studying acting at the Webber Douglas School of Singing and Dramatic Art in Kensington, West London, first appearing onstage as a lady-in-waiting in the school's production of Maxwell Anderson's Mary of Scotland. That year, Angela's grandfather died, and with the onset of the Blitz, Macgill decided to take Angela, Bruce and Edgar to the United States; Isolde remained in Britain with her new husband, the actor Peter Ustinov. Macgill secured a job supervising sixty British children who were being evacuated to North America aboard the Duchess of Athol, arriving with them in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in mid-August. From there, she proceeded by train to New York City, where she was financially sponsored by a Wall Street businessman, Charles T. Smith, moving in with his family at their home at Mahopac, New York. Lansbury gained a scholarship from the American Theatre Wing allowing her to study at the Feagin School of Drama and Radio, where she appeared in performances of William Congreve's The Way of the World and Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan. She graduated in March 1942, by which time the family had moved to a flat in Morton Street, Greenwich Village.  Acting Career =1942-1945: Gaslight and success in smaller roles= Macgill secured work in a Canadian touring production of Tonight at 8.30, and was joined in Canada by her daughter, who gained her first theatrical job as a nightclub act at the Samovar Club, Montreal. Having gained the job by claiming to be 19 when she was 16, her act consisted of her singing songs by No√´l Coward, and earned her $60 a week. She returned to New York City in August 1942, but her mother had moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, in order to resurrect her cinematic career; Lansbury and her brothers followed. Moving into a bungalow in Laurel Canyon, both Lansbury and her mother obtained Christmas jobs at the Bullocks Wilshire department store in Los Angeles; Moyna was sacked for incompetence, leaving the family to subsist on Lansbury's wages of $28 a week. Befriending a group of gay men, Lansbury became privy to the city's underground gay scene, and with her mother, attended lectures by the spiritual guru Jiddu Krishnamurti; at one of these, she met Aldous Huxley. Lansbury in the trailer for The Picture of Dorian Gray At a party hosted by her mother, Lansbury met John van Druten, who had recently co-authored a script for Gaslight (1944), a mystery-thriller based on Patrick Hamilton's 1938 play, Gaslight. Set in Victorian London, the film was being directed by George Cukor, and starred Ingrid Bergman in the lead role of Paula Alquist, a woman being psychologically tormented by her husband. Van Druten suggested that Lansbury would be perfect for the role of Nancy Oliver, a conniving cockney maid; she was accepted for the part, although, since she was only 17, a social worker had to accompany her on the set. Obtaining an agent, Earl Kramer, she was signed to a seven-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, earning $500 a week and using her real name as her professional name. Already her casting received attention, with Variety magazine in August 1943 claiming Lansbury to have gone from unknown to movie star in just four days. \\"From Gaslight to spotlight\\", Variety Magazine, 11 Aug 1943, page 6 Upon release, Gaslight received mixed critical reviews, although Lansbury's role was widely praised; the film earned six Academy Award nominations, including one for Best Supporting Actress for Lansbury. Her next film appearance was as Edwina Brown, the older sister of Velvet Brown in National Velvet (1944); the film proved to be a major commercial hit, with Lansbury developing a lifelong friendship with co-star Elizabeth Taylor. Lansbury next starred in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), a cinematic adaptation of Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel of the same name, which was again set in Victorian London. Directed by Albert Lewin, Lansbury was cast as Sibyl Vane, a working-class music hall singer who falls in love with the protagonist, Dorian Gray (Hurd Hatfield). Although the film was not a financial success, Lansbury's performance once more drew praise, earning her a Golden Globe Award, and she was again nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards, losing to Anne Revere, her co-star in National Velvet. =1945-1951: Later MGM films= On September 27, 1945, Lansbury married Richard Cromwell, an artist and decorator whose acting career had come to a standstill. Their marriage was troubled; Cromwell was gay, and had married Lansbury in the unsuccessful hope that it would turn him heterosexual. The marriage ended in less than a year when she filed for divorce on September 11, 1946, but they remained friends until his death. In December 1946, she was introduced to fellow English expatriate Peter Pullen Shaw at a party held by former co-star Hurd Hatfield in Ojai Valley. Shaw was an aspiring actor, also signed to MGM, and had recently left a relationship with Joan Crawford. He and Lansbury became a couple, living together before she proposed marriage. Lansbury in a scene from MGM's Till the Clouds Roll By (1946), one of her earliest film appearances The couple were intent on getting married back in Britain, but the Church of England refused to marry two divorcees. Instead, they wed in a Church of Scotland ceremony at St. Columba's Church in Knightsbridge, London, in August 1949, followed by a honeymoon in France. Returning to the U.S., where they settled into Lansbury's home in Rustic Canyon, Malibu, in 1951 both became naturalised U.S. citizens, albeit retaining their British citizenship via dual nationality. Following the success of Gaslight and The Picture of Dorian Gray, MGM cast Lansbury in eleven further films until her contract with the company ended in 1952. Keeping her among their B-list stars, MGM used her less than their similar- aged actresses; biographers Edelman and Kupferberg believed that the majority of these films were \\"mediocre\\", doing little to further her career. This view was echoed by Cukor, who believed Lansbury had been \\"consistently miscast\\" by MGM. She was repeatedly made to portray older women, often villainous, and as a result became increasingly dissatisfied with working for MGM, commenting that \\"I kept wanting to play the Jean Arthur roles, and Mr Mayer kept casting me as a series of venal bitches.\\" The company themselves were suffering from the post-1948 slump in cinema sales, as a result slashing film budgets and cutting their number of staff. Lansbury played her first American character as \\"Em,\\" a tough honky-tonk saloon singer who slaps Judy Garland's character in the Oscar-winning Wild West musical The Harvey Girls (1946). She appeared in The Hoodlum Saint (also 1946), Till the Clouds Roll By (1947), If Winter Comes (1947), Tenth Avenue Angel (1948), The Three Musketeers (1948), State of the Union (1948) and The Red Danube (1949). She was loaned by MGM first to United Artists for The Private Affairs of Bel Ami (1947), and then to Paramount for Samson and Delilah (1949). She appeared as a villainous maidservant in Kind Lady (1951) and a French adventuress in Mutiny (1952). Turning to radio, in 1948 she appeared in an audio adaptation of Somerset Maugham's Of Human Bondage for NBC University Theatre and the following year she starred in their adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. Moving into television, she appeared in a 1950 episode of Robert Montgomery Presents adapted from A.J. Cronin's The Citadel. =1952-1965: The Manchurian Candidate and minor roles= Lansbury with her children in 1957 Unhappy with the roles she was being given by MGM, Lansbury instructed her manager, Harry Friedman of MCA Inc., to terminate her contract in 1952, in the same year that her son Anthony was born. Soon after the birth, she joined the East Coast touring productions of two former-Broadway plays: Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse's Remains to be Seen and Louis Verneuil's Affairs of State. Biographer Margaret Bonanno later stated that at this point, Lansbury's career had \\"hit an all-time low.\\" In April 1953, her daughter Deirdre Angela Shaw was born. Shaw had a son by a previous marriage, David, and after gaining legal custody of the boy in 1953, brought him to California to live with the family; with three children to raise, the Shaws moved to a larger house on San Vincente Boulevard in Santa Monica. However, Lansbury did not feel entirely comfortable in the Hollywood social scene, later asserting that as a result of her British roots, \\"in Hollywood, I always felt like a stranger in a strange land.\\" In 1959, the family moved to Malibu, settling into a house on the Pacific Coast Highway that had been designed by Aaron Green; there, she and Peter escaped the Hollywood scene, and were able to send their children to a local public school. Returning to cinema as a freelance actress, Lansbury found herself typecast as women older (sometimes far older) than herself in many films in which she appeared during this period. As she later stated, \\"Hollywood made me old before my time,\\" noting that in her twenties she was receiving fan mail from people who believed her to be in her forties. She obtained minor roles in the films A Life at Stake (1954), A Lawless Street (1955) and The Purple Mask (1955), later describing the last as \\"the worst movie I ever made.\\" She played Princess Gwendolyn in the comedy film The Court Jester (1956), before taking on the role of a wife who kills her husband in Please Murder Me (1956). From there she appeared as Minnie Littlejohn in The Long Hot Summer (1958), and as Mabel Claremont in The Reluctant Debutante (1958), which she filmed in Paris. Biographer Martin Gottfried said that it was these latter two cinematic appearances which restored Lansbury's status as an \\"A-picture actress\\". Throughout this period, she continued making appearances on television, starring in episodes of Revlon Mirror Theatre, Ford Theatre and The George Gobel Show, and became a regular on game show Pantomime Quiz. In April 1957 she debuted on Broadway at the Henry Miller Theatre in Hotel Paradiso, a French burlesque set in Paris, directed by Peter Glenville. The play only ran for 15 weeks, although she earned good reviews for her role as \\"Marcel Cat\\". She later stated that had she not appeared in the play, her \\"whole career would have fizzled out.\\" She followed this with an appearance in 1960s Broadway performance of A Taste of Honey at the Lyceum Theatre, directed by Tony Richardson and George Devine. Lansbury played Helen, the boorish, verbally abusive, otherwise absentee mother of Josephine (played by Joan Plowright, only four years Lansbury's junior), remarking that she gained \\"a great deal of satisfaction\\" from the role. During the show's run, Lansbury developed a friendship with Plowright, as well as with Plowright's lover and future husband, Laurence Olivier. It was from Lansbury's rented flat on East 97th Street that Plowright and Olivier eloped to be married. After a well- reviewed appearance in Summer of the Seventeenth Doll (1959) ‚Äì for which she had filmed in Sydney, Australia ‚Äì and a minor role in A Breath of Scandal (1960), she appeared in 1961's Blue Hawaii as an overbearing mother, whose son was played by Elvis Presley. Acknowledging that the film was of poor quality, she commented that she agreed to appear in it because \\"I was desperate.\\" Lansbury and Joan Plowright in A Taste of Honey on Broadway in 1961 Her rare sympathetic role as Mavis in The Dark at the Top of the Stairs (1960) drew critical acclaim, as did her performances as sinister characters in All Fall Down (1962), as a manipulative, destructive mother, and the Cold War thriller The Manchurian Candidate (1962) as the scheming ideologue Mrs. Iselin. In the latter, she was cast for the role by John Frankenheimer based on her performance in All Fall Down. Lansbury was only three years older than actor Laurence Harvey who played her son in the film. She had agreed to appear in the film after reading the original novel, describing it as \\"one of the most exciting political books I ever read.\\" Biographers Edelman and Kupferberg considered this role \\"her enduring cinematic triumph,\\" while Gottfried stated that it was \\"the strongest, the most memorable and the best picture she ever made ... she gives her finest film performance in it.\\" Lansbury received her third Best Supporting Actress Academy Award nomination for the film, and was bothered by the fact that she lost, losing to Patty Duke for The Miracle Worker (1962). She followed this with a performance as Sybil Logan in In the Cool of the Day (1963) ‚Äì a film she renounced as awful ‚Äì before appearing as wealthy Isabel Boyd in The World of Henry Orient (1964) and the widow Phyllis in Dear Heart (1964). Her first appearance in a theatrical musical was the short-lived Anyone Can Whistle, written by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim. An experimental work, it opened at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway in April 1964, but was critically panned and closed after nine performances. Lansbury had played the role of crooked mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and although she loved Sondheim's score she faced personal differences with Laurents and was glad when the show closed. In 1965 she appeared in a second- season episode of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. television series as a marvellously flamboyant and wealthy actress. She appeared in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), a cinematic biopic of Jesus, but was cut almost entirely from the final edit. She followed this with an appearance as Mama Jean Bello in Harlow (1965), as Lady Blystone in The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders (1965), and as Gloria in Mister Buddwing (1966). Despite her well-received performances in a number of films, \\"celluloid superstardom\\" evaded her, and she became increasingly dissatisfied with these minor roles, feeling that none allowed her to explore her potential as an actress. =1966-1969: Mame and theatrical stardom= A publicity shot of Lansbury from 1966 In 1966, Lansbury took on the title role of Mame Dennis in the musical Mame, Jerry Herman's musical adaptation of the novel Auntie Mame. The director's first choice for the role had been Rosalind Russell, who played Mame in the non-musical film adaptation Auntie Mame, but she had declined. Lansbury actively sought the role in the hope that it would mark a change in her career. When she was chosen, it came as a surprise to theatre critics, who believed that it would go to a better-known actress; Lansbury was forty-one years old, and it was her first starring role. Mame Dennis was a glamorous character, with over twenty costume changes throughout the play, and Lansbury's role involved ten songs and dance routines which she trained extensively for. First appearing in Philadelphia and then Boston, Mame opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in May 1966. Auntie Mame was already popular among the gay community, and Mame gained Lansbury a cult gay following, something that she later attributed to the fact that Mame Dennis was \\"every gay person's idea of glamour ... Everything about Mame coincided with every young man's idea of beauty and glory and it was lovely.\\" Reviews of Lansbury's performance were overwhelmingly positive. In The New York Times, Stanley Kauffmann wrote: \\"Miss Lansbury is a singing-dancing actress, not a singer or dancer who also acts ... In this marathon role she has wit, poise, warmth and a very taking coolth.\\"Kauffmann, Stanley (May 25, 1966). \\"Theatre: Mame Is Back with a Splash as Musical\\". The New York Times. p. 41. The role resulted in Lansbury receiving her first Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. Lansbury's later biographer Margaret Bonanno claimed that Mame made Lansbury a \\"superstar\\", with the actress herself commenting on her success by stating that \\"Everyone loves you, everyone loves the success, and enjoys it as much as you do. And it lasts as long as you are on that stage and as long as you keep coming out of that stage door.\\" The stardom achieved through Mame allowed Lansbury to make further appearances on television, such as on Perry Como's Thanksgiving Special in November 1966. Her fame also allowed her to engage in a variety of high-profile charitable endeavors, for instance appearing as the guest of honor at the 1967 March of Dimes annual benefit luncheon. She was invited to star in a musical performance for the 1968 Academy Awards ceremony, and co-hosted that year's Tony Awards with former brother-in-law Peter Ustinov. That year, Harvard University's Hasty Pudding Club elected her \\"Woman of the Year\\". When the film adaptation of Mame was put into production, Lansbury hoped to be offered the part, but it instead went to Lucille Ball, an established box-office success. Lansbury considered this to be \\"one of my bitterest disappointments\\". Her personal life was further complicated when she learned that both of her children had become involved with the counterculture of the 1960s and had been using recreational drugs; as a result, Anthony had become addicted to cocaine and heroin. Lansbury followed the success of Mame with a performance as Countess Aurelia, the 75-year-old Parisian eccentric in Dear World, a musical adaptation of Jean Giraudoux's The Madwoman of Chaillot. The show opened at Broadway's Mark Hellinger Theatre in February 1969, but Lansbury found it a \\"pretty depressing\\" experience. Reviews of her performance were positive, and she was awarded her second Tony Award on the basis of it. Reviews of the show more generally were critical, however, and it ended after 132 performances. She followed this with an appearance in the title role of the musical Prettybelle, which was based upon Jean Arnold's The Rape of Prettybelle. Set in the Deep South, it dealt with issues of racism, with Lansbury as a wealthy alcoholic who seeks sexual encounters with black men. A controversial play, it opened in Boston but received poor reviews, being cancelled before it reached Broadway. Lansbury later described the play as \\"a complete and utter fiasco\\", admitting that in her opinion, her \\"performance was awful\\". =1970-1978: Ireland and Gypsy= Lansbury declined several cinematic roles, including the lead in The Killing of Sister George (1968) and the role of Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). Instead, she accepted the role of the Countess von Ornstein, an aging German aristocrat who falls in love with a younger man, in Something for Everyone (1970), for which she filmed on location in Hohenschwangen, Bavaria. That same year she appeared as the middle-aged English witch Eglantine Price in the Disney film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971); this was her first lead in a screen musical, and led to her publicising the film on television programmes like the David Frost Show. She later noted that as a big commercial hit, this film \\"secured an enormous audience for me\\". The year 1970 was traumatic for the Lansbury family, as Peter underwent a hip replacement, Anthony suffered a heroin overdose and entered a coma, and in September the family's Malibu home was destroyed in a brush fire. They then purchased Knockmourne Glebe, a farmhouse constructed in the 1820s which was located near the village of Conna in rural County Cork, and, after Anthony quit using cocaine and heroin, took him there to recover from his drug addiction. He subsequently enrolled in the Webber- Douglas School, his mother's alma mater, and became a professional actor, before moving into television directing. Lansbury and her husband did not return to California, instead dividing their time between County Cork and New York City. In 1972, Lansbury returned to London's West End to perform in the Royal Shakespeare Company's theatrical production of Edward Albee's All Over at the Aldwych Theatre. She portrayed the mistress of a dying New England millionaire, and although the play's reviews were mixed, Lansbury's acting was widely praised. This was followed by her reluctant involvement in a revival of Mame, which was then touring the United States, after which she returned to the West End to play the character of Rose in the musical Gypsy. She had initially turned down the role, not wishing to be in the shadow of Ethel Merman, who had portrayed the character in the original Broadway production, but eventually accepted it; when the show started in May 1973, she earned a standing ovation and rave reviews. Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour. Following the culmination of the London run, in 1974 Gypsy went on a tour of the U.S., and in Chicago Lansbury was awarded the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance. The show eventually reached Broadway, where it ran until January 1975; a critical success, it earned Lansbury her third Tony Award. After several months' break, Gypsy then toured throughout the country again in the summer of 1975. Desiring to move on from musicals, Lansbury decided that she wanted to appear in a production of one of William Shakespeare's plays. She obtained the role of Gertrude in the National Theatre Company's production of Hamlet, staged at the Old Vic. Directed by Peter Hall, the production ran from December 1975 to May 1976, receiving mixed reviews; Lansbury later commented that she \\"hated\\" the role, believing it too restrained. Her mood was worsened by the news that in November 1975 her mother had died in California; Lansbury had her mother's body cremated and the ashes scattered near her own County Cork home. Her next theatrical appearance was in two one-act plays by Edward Albee, Counting the Ways and Listening, performed side by side at the Hartford Stage Company in Connecticut. Reviews of the production were mixed, although Lansbury was again singled out for praise. This was followed by another revival tour of Gypsy. In April 1978, Lansbury appeared in 24 performances of a revival of The King and I musical staged at Broadway's Uris Theatre; Lansbury played the role of Mrs Anna, replacing Constance Towers, who was on a short break. Her first cinematic role in seven years was as novelist and murder victim Salome Otterbourne in Death on the Nile (1978), an adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1937 novel of the same name that was filmed in both London and Egypt. In the film Lansbury starred alongside Peter Ustinov and Bette Davis, who became a close friend. The role earned Lansbury the National Board of Review award for Best Supporting Actress of 1978. =1979-1984: Sweeney Todd and continued film work= In March 1979, Lansbury first appeared as Nellie Lovett in Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, a Stephen Sondheim musical directed by Harold Prince. Opening at the Uris Theatre on Broadway, she starred alongside Len Cariou as Sweeney Todd, the murderous barber in 19th century London. After being offered the role, she jumped on the opportunity due to the involvement of Sondheim in the project; she commented that she loved \\"the extraordinary wit and intelligence of his lyrics.\\" She remained in the role for fourteen months before being replaced by Dorothy Loudon; the musical received mixed critical reviews, although it earned Lansbury her fourth Tony Award and After Dark magazine's Ruby Award for Broadway Performer of the Year. She returned to the role in October 1980 for a ten-month tour of six U.S. cities, with George Hearn playing the title character; the production was also filmed and broadcast on the Entertainment Channel. In 1982, she took on the role of an upper middle class housewife who champions workers' rights in A Little Family Business, a farce set in Baltimore in which her son Anthony also starred. It debuted at Los Angeles' Ahmanson Theatre before heading on to Broadway's Martin Beck Theatre. It was critically panned and induced accusations of racism from the Japanese-American community. That year, Lansbury was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame, and the following year appeared in a Mame revival at Broadway's Gershwin Theatre. Although Lansbury was praised, the show was a commercial flop, with Lansbury noting that \\"I realised that it's not a show of today. It's a period piece.\\" Working prolifically in cinema, Lansbury appeared as Miss Froy in The Lady Vanishes (1979), a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's earlier film released in 1938. The following year's The Mirror Crack'd featured her in another film based on an Agatha Christie novel, this time as Miss Marple, a sleuth in 1950s Kent. Lansbury hoped to get away from the depiction of the role by Margaret Rutherford, instead returning to Christie's description of the character; in this she created a precursor to her later role of Jessica Fletcher. She was signed to appear in two sequels as Miss Marple, but these were never made. Lansbury's next film was the animated The Last Unicorn (1982), for which she provided the voice of the witch Mommy Fortuna. Returning to musical cinema, she starred as Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance (1983), a film based on Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera of the same name, and while filming it in London sang on a recording of The Beggar's Opera. This was followed by an appearance as the grandmother in the gothic fantasy film The Company of Wolves (1984). Lansbury had also begun work for television, appearing in a television film with Bette Davis titled Little Gloria... Happy at Last (1982). She followed this with an appearance in CBS's The Gift of Love: A Christmas Story (1983), later describing it as \\"the most unsophisticated thing you can imagine\\". A BBC television film followed, A Talent for Murder (1984), in which she played a wheelchair-bound mystery writer; although describing it as \\"a rush job\\", she agreed to do it in order to work with co-star Laurence Olivier. Two further miniseries featuring Lansbury appeared in 1984: Lace and The First Olympics: Athens 1896. =1984-1996: Murder, She Wrote= Mame original Broadway cast members Beatrice Arthur and Angela Lansbury at the 41st Primetime Emmy Awards (1989). The two had remained close friends over the years. In 1983, Lansbury was offered two main television roles, one in a sitcom and the other in a detective series. Unable to do both, she chose to do the detective series despite the fact her agents had advised her to accept the sitcom. The series, Murder, She Wrote, centered on the character of Jessica Fletcher, a retired school teacher from the fictional town of Cabot Cove, Maine, who became a successful detective novelist after her husband's death, also solving murders encountered during her travels. Lansbury described the character as \\"an American Miss Marple\\". The series was created by Peter S. Fischer, Richard Levinson, and William Link, who had earlier had success with Columbo, and the role of Jessica Fletcher had been first offered to Jean Stapleton, who declined the role, as did Doris Day. The pilot episode, \\"The Murder of Sherlock Holmes,\\" premiered on CBS on September 30, 1984, with the rest of the first season airing on Sundays from 8 to 9 p.m. Although critical reviews were mixed, it proved highly popular, with the pilot having a Nielsen rating of 18.9 and the first season being rated top in its time slot. Designed as inoffensive family viewing, despite its topic the show eschewed depicting violence or gore, following the \\"whodunit\\" format rather than those of most contemporary U.S. crime shows; Lansbury herself commented that \\"best of all, there's no violence. I hate violence.\\" Lansbury was defensive about Jessica Fletcher, having creative input over the character's costumes, makeup and hair, and rejecting pressure from network executives to put her in a relationship, believing that the character should remain a strong single female. When she believed that a scriptwriter had made Jessica do or say things that did not fit with the character's personality, Lansbury ensured that the script was changed. She saw Jessica as a role model for older female viewers, praising her \\"enormous, universal appeal ‚Äì that was an accomplishment I never expected in my entire life.\\" Lansbury biographers Rob Edelman and Audrey E. Kupferberg described the series as \\"a television landmark\\" in the U.S. for having an older female character as the protagonist, thereby paving the way for later series like The Golden Girls. Lansbury herself noted that \\"I think it's the first time a show has really been aimed at the middle aged audience,\\" and although it was most popular among senior citizens, it gradually gained a younger audience. By 1991, one third of viewers were under age 50. It gained continually high ratings throughout most of its run, outdoing rivals in its time slot such as Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories on NBC. In February 1987, a spin-off was produced, The Law & Harry McGraw, although it was short-lived. As the show's run continued, Lansbury assumed a larger role behind the scenes. In 1989, her own company, Corymore Productions, began co-producing the show with Universal. Nevertheless, she began to tire of the series, and in particular the long working hours, stating that the 1990‚Äì91 season would be the show's last. She changed her mind after being appointed executive producer for the 1992‚Äì93 season, something that she felt \\"made it far more interesting to me.\\" For the 8th season, the show's setting moved to New York City, where Jessica had taken a job teaching criminology at Manhattan University. The move was an attempt to attract younger viewers and was encouraged by Lansbury. Having become a \\"Sunday-night institution\\" in the U.S., the show's ratings improved during the early 1990s, becoming a Top Five programme. However, CBS executives, hoping to gain a larger audience, moved it to Thursdays at 8pm, opposite NBC's new sitcom, Friends. Lansbury was angry at the move, believing that it ignored the show's core audience. The final episode of the series aired in May 1996, and ended with Lansbury voicing a \\"Goodbye from Jessica\\" message at the end. Tom Shales wrote in The Washington Post: \\"The title of the show's last episode, \\"Death by Demographics,\\" is in itself something of a protest. Murder, She Wrote is partly a victim of commercial television's mad youth mania.\\" At the time it tied the original Hawaii Five-O as the longest-running detective drama series in television history, and the role would prove to be the most successful and prominent of Lansbury's career. Lansbury initially had plans for a Murder She Wrote television film that would be a musical with a score composed by Jerry Herman. While this project did not materialise, it was transformed into Mrs Santa Claus ‚Äì in which Lansbury played Santa Claus' wife ‚Äì which proved to be a ratings hit. Throughout the run of Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury had continued making appearances in other television films, miniseries and cinema. In 1986, she co-hosted the New York Philharmonic's televised tribute to the centenary of the Statue of Liberty with Kirk Douglas. She appeared as the protagonist's mother in Rage of Angels: The Story Continues (1986), and portrayed Nan Moore ‚Äì the mother of a victim of the real-life Korean Air Lines Flight 007 plane crash ‚Äì in Shootdown (1988); being a mother herself, she had been \\"enormously touched by the incident.\\" She was featured in The Shell Seekers (1989) as an Englishwoman recuperating from a heart attack, and starred in The Love She Sought (1990) as an American school teacher who falls in love with a Catholic priest while visiting Ireland; Lansbury thought it \\"a marvelous woman's story.\\" She next starred as the Cockney Mrs Harris in a film adaptation of the novel Mrs 'Arris Goes to Paris (1992), which was directed by her son and executive produced by her stepson. Her highest profile cinematic role since The Manchurian Candidate was as the voice of the singing teapot Mrs. Potts in the Disney animation Beauty and the Beast (1991), an appearance that she considered to be a gift to her 3 grandchildren. Lansbury performed the title song to the film, which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song and Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media. Lansbury's higher profile gained from Murder, She Wrote resulted in her being employed to appear in advertisements and infomercials for Bufferin, MasterCard and the Beatrix Potter Company. In 1988, she released a video titled Angela Lansbury's Positive Moves: My Personal Plan for Fitness and Well-Being, in which she outlined her personal exercise routine, and in 1990 published a book with the same title co-written with Mimi Avins, which she dedicated to her mother. As a result of her work, she was appointed a CBE, awarded to her in a ceremony by the Prince of Wales at the British consulate in Los Angeles. While living most of the year in California, Lansbury spent Christmases and summers at Corymore House, her farmhouse overlooking the Atlantic Ocean at Ballywilliam, near Churchtown South, County Cork, which she had specially built as a family home in 1991. =1997-Present: Return to theatre, film roles= Deuce, New York City, 2007 Following the end of Murder, She Wrote, Lansbury returned to the theatre. Although cast in the lead role in the 2001 Kander and Ebb musical The Visit, she withdrew before it opened due to her husband's deteriorating health. Peter died in January 2003 of congestive heart failure at the couple's Brentwood, California home. Lansbury felt that after this event she would not take on any more major acting roles, and that instead might make a few cameo appearances but nothing more. Wanting to spend more time in New York City, in 2006 she purchased a $2 million condominium in Manhattan. She made an appearance in a Season 6 episode of the television show Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award in 2005. She starred in the film Nanny McPhee (2005) as Aunt Adelaide, later informing an interviewer that working on Nanny McPhee \\"pulled me out of the abyss\\" after the loss of her husband. She then appeared in the film Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011), opposite Jim Carrey. Lansbury returned to Broadway after a 23-year absence in Deuce, a play by Terrence McNally that opened at the Music Box Theatre in May 2007 for a limited run of eighteen weeks. Lansbury received a Tony Award nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Play for her role. In March 2009 she returned to Broadway for a revival of Blithe Spirit at the Shubert Theatre, where she took on the role of Madame Arcati. This appearance earned her the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play; this was her fifth Tony Award, tying her with the previous record holder for the number of Tony Awards, Julie Harris, albeit all of Harris' Tonys were for Best Leading Actress. From December 2009 to June 2010, Lansbury then starred as Madame Armfeldt alongside Catherine Zeta-Jones in the first Broadway revival of A Little Night Music, held at the Walter Kerr Theatre. The role earned her a seventh Tony Award nomination, while in May 2010, she was awarded an honorary doctoral degree from Manhattan School of Music. In 2012, it was announced that Lansbury was set to star opposite Johnny Depp in Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel; however, she had to back out of the project due to prior scheduling conflicts with the Australian production of Driving Miss Daisy, in which she co-starred alongside James Earl Jones. James Earl Jones with Lansbury promoting Driving Miss Daisy in 2013 From April to July 2012, Lansbury starred as women's rights advocate Sue-Ellen Gamadge in the Broadway revival of Gore Vidal's The Best Man at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre. From February to June 2013, Lansbury starred alongside James Earl Jones in an Australian tour of Driving Miss Daisy. In November 2013, she received an Academy Honorary Award for her lifetime achievement at the Governors Awards. From March to June 2014, Lansbury reprised her performance as Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit at the Gielgud Theatre in London's West End, her first London stage appearance in nearly 40 years. While in London, she made an appearance at the Angela Lansbury Film Festival in Poplar, a screening of some of her best known films organised by Poplar Film. From December 2014 to March 2015, she joined the tour of Blithe Spirit across North America. In April 2015, aged 89, she received her first Olivier Award as Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Arcati, and in November 2015 was awarded the Oscar Hammerstein Award for Lifetime Achievement in Musical Theatre. On June 2, 2016, it was officially announced that Lansbury would return to Broadway in the 2017‚Äì18 season in a revival of Enid Bagnold's 1955 play The Chalk Garden. The play was produced by Scott Rudin at a theatre to-be-announced.Viagas, Robert. \\"Exclusive: Angela Lansbury Confirms Broadway Return in Chalk Garden\\" , Playbill.com, June 2, 2016. However, in an interview published on September 20, 2016, Lansbury stated that she will not be performing in The Chalk Garden, saying: \\"At my time of life, I've decided that I want to be with family more and being alone in New York doing a play requires an extraordinary amount of time left alone.\\"\\"Exclusive: Angela Lansbury Reveals She Won't Return to Broadway in 'THE CHALK GARDEN' broadwayworld.com, September 20, 2016 In December 2017, Lansbury took on the role of Aunt March in the BBC television miniseries Little Women. She also appeared in Mary Poppins Returns (2018), a sequel to the Academy Award-winning 1964 original film, set 20 years later in Depression-era London. Filming began at Shepperton Studios in February 2017, and the film was released in December 2018.\\"Mary Poppins Returns: Angela Lansbury joins cast of Disney sequel\\" independent.co.uk, February 19, 2017 In January 2019, Lansbury was invited to the American Film Institute's luncheon to give the annual benediction where she talked about her experiences at M-G-M, the craft of acting and the importance of a film community. The appearance was a surprise to the group of film and television stars who gave her a standing ovation. Lansbury concluded her remarks by giving advice to the possible Oscar, and Golden Globe contenders about the awards season stating, \\"As you leave here today and are invited to endure a seemingly endless parade of programs that label you a 'winner' or a 'loser' ‚Äì I've been there, I've done that, remember this room, when we are all together as one.\\" On November 18, 2019, Lansbury returned to Broadway portraying Lady Bracknell in a one- night benefit staging of Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest for Roundabout Theatre Company's American Airlines Theatre. In October 2020, Variety magazine considered her career to \\"defy all logic\\". Personality and personal life Lansbury has spoken throughout her life with an English accent. She holds Irish citizenship. Biographer Martin Gottfried characterized her as \\"Meticulous. Cautious. Self-editing. Deliberate. It is what the British call reserved,\\" adding that she was \\"as concerned, as sensitive, and as sympathetic as anyone might want in a friend.\\" Also noting that she had \\"a profound sense of privacy,\\" he added that she disliked attempts at flattery. Lansbury has been married twice, first to the actor Richard Cromwell, when she was 19 and Cromwell was 35. Cromwell and Lansbury eloped and were married in a small civil ceremony on September 27, 1945. The marriage ended in divorce in 1946, but they remained friends until his death in 1960. In 1949, she married actor Peter Shaw, and they remained together for 54 years until his death in 2003. She acquired a step-son, David, from Shaw's first marriage. They had two children of their own, Anthony Peter (b. 1952) and Deirdre Ann (b. 1953). While Lansbury repeatedly stated that she wanted to put her children before her career, she admitted that she often had to leave them in California for long periods when she was working elsewhere. She brought up her children to be Episcopalian, although they were not members of a congregation. She has stated that \\"I believe that God is within all of us, that we are perfect, precious beings, and that we have to put our faith and trust in that.\\" Angela Lansbury in 1950 In the latter part of the 1960s, Anthony and Deirdre became involved in the growing counterculture movement and started using recreational drugs. Deirdre developed an acquaintance with the Manson family, while Anthony became addicted to cocaine and heroin, giving it up in 1971. After recovering, Anthony became a television director, and directed 68 episodes of Murder, She Wrote, also marrying and having three children. Deirdre married a chef, and together they opened a restaurant in West Los Angeles. Lansbury is a cousin of the Postgate family, including the animator, writer and social activist Oliver Postgate, as well as the academic and novelist Coral Lansbury, whose son is former Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull. As a young actress, Lansbury was a self-professed homebody, commenting that \\"I love the world of housekeeping.\\" She preferred spending quiet evenings inside with friends to the Hollywood night life. Her hobbies at the time included reading, horse riding, playing tennis, cooking, and playing the piano; she also had a keen interest in gardening. She has cited F. Scott Fitzgerald as her favorite author, and cited Roseanne and Seinfeld as being among her favorite television shows. Lansbury was an avid letter writer, doing so by hand and making copies of all her correspondences. At Howard Gotlieb's request, Lansbury's papers are housed at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. She is a supporter of the United States Democratic Party, describing herself as \\"Democrat from the ground up,\\" and the British Labour Party. Throughout her career, Lansbury supported a variety of charities, particularly those such as Abused Wives in Crisis that combated domestic abuse and those who worked toward rehabilitating drug users. In the 1980s, she began to support a number of charities engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In early life she had been a chain smoker, giving up the addiction cold turkey in the mid-1960s. In 1976 and 1987, she had cosmetic surgery on her neck to prevent it from broadening with age. During the 1990s, she began to suffer from arthritis, in May 1994 had hip replacement surgery, and in 2005 had knee replacement surgery. Recognition and legacy In the 1960s, The New York Times referred to Lansbury as the \\"First Lady of Musical Theatre.\\" Lansbury described herself as an actress who could also sing, with Sondheim stating that she had a strong voice, albeit with a limited range. Lansbury's authorised biographer Martin Gottfried described her as \\"an American icon,\\" with a \\"practically saintly\\" public image. A 2007 interviewer for The New York Times described her as \\"one of the few actors it makes sense to call beloved,\\" noting that a 1994 article in People magazine awarded her a perfect score on its \\"lovability index.\\" The New Statesman commented that she \\"has the kind of pulling power many younger and more ubiquitous actors can only dream of, while an article in The Independent has suggested that she could be considered Britain's most successful actress. She is a gay icon, and has asserted that she is \\"very proud of the fact,\\" attributing her popularity among the LGBT community to her performance in Mame. Angela Lansbury, star on the Walk of Fame She has been recognized for her achievements in Britain on multiple occasions. In 2002, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) gave Lansbury a Lifetime Achievement Award.

On being made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle, Lansbury stated: \\"I'm joining a marvellous group of women I greatly admire like Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. It's a lovely thing to be given that nod of approval by your own country and I really cherish it.\\" Lansbury has never won an Emmy Award despite 18 nominations (17 of them Primetime Emmy Awards) for which she was nominated over a 33-year period. As of 2009, she held the record for the most Emmy losses by a performer.She has 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations per She has been nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress but has never won; reflecting on this in 2007, she stated that she was at first \\"terribly disappointed, but subsequently very glad that [she] did not win,\\" because she believes that she would have otherwise had a less successful career.

He served as a member of parliament (MP) from 1875 to 1891. His party held the balance of power in the House of Commons during the Home Rule debates of 1885‚Äì1890. Born into a powerful Anglo-Irish Protestant landowning family, he was a land reform agitator, founder in 1879 of the Irish National Land League. He became leader of the Home Rule League, operating independently of the Liberal Party, winning great influence by his balancing of constitutional, radical, and economic issues, and by his skilful use of parliamentary procedure. He was imprisoned in Kilmainham Gaol, Dublin, in 1882, but he was released when he renounced violent extra-Parliamentary action. The same year, he reformed the Home Rule League as the Irish Parliamentary Party, which he controlled minutely as Britain's first disciplined democratic party. The hung parliament of 1885 saw him hold the balance of power between William Gladstone's Liberal Party and Lord Salisbury's Conservative Party. His power was one factor in Gladstone's adoption of Home Rule as the central tenet of the Liberal Party. His reputation peaked from 1889 to 1890, when letters published in The Times linking him to the Phoenix Park killings of 1882 were shown to have been forged by Richard Pigott. However, the Irish Parliamentary Party split in 1890 after the revelation of Parnell's long adulterous love affair, causing many British Liberals (many of them nonconformists) to refuse to work with him, and strong opposition from Catholic bishops. He headed a small minority faction until his death in 1891. Parnell is celebrated as the best organiser of a political party up to that time, and one of the most formidable figures in parliamentary history. Many believe that Home Rule could have been achieved without bloodshed, if he had not been brought down by personal circumstances. Early life Charles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale House, County Wicklow. He was the third son and seventh child of John Henry Parnell (1811‚Äì1859), a wealthy Anglo-Irish Anglican landowner, and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart (1816‚Äì1898) of Bordentown, New Jersey, daughter of the American naval hero, Admiral Charles Stewart (the stepson of one of George Washington's bodyguards). There were eleven children in all: five boys and six girls. Admiral Stewart's mother, Parnell's great- grandmother, belonged to the Tudor family, so Parnell had a distant relationship with the British Royal Family. John Henry Parnell himself was a cousin of one of Ireland's leading aristocrats, Viscount Powerscourt, and also the grandson of a Chancellor of the Exchequer in Grattan's Parliament, Sir John Parnell, who lost office in 1799, when he opposed the Act of Union. The Parnells of Avondale were descended from a Protestant English merchant family, which came to prominence in Congleton, Cheshire, early in the 17th century where as Baron Congleton two generations held the office of Mayor of Congleton before moving to Ireland. The family produced a number of notable figures, including Thomas Parnell (1679‚Äì1718), the Irish poet, and Henry Parnell, 1st Baron Congleton (1776‚Äì1842), the Irish politician. Parnell's grandfather William Parnell (1780‚Äì1821), who inherited the Avondale Estate in 1795, was an Irish liberal Party MP for Wicklow from 1817 to 1820. Thus, from birth, Charles Stewart Parnell possessed an extraordinary number of links to many elements of society; he was linked to the old Irish Parliamentary tradition via his great-grandfather and grandfather, to the American War of Independence via his grandfather, to the War of 1812 (where his grandfather Charles Stewart (1778‚Äì1869) had been awarded a gold medal by the United States Congress for gallantry in the U.S. Navy). Parnell belonged to the Church of Ireland, disestablished in 1868 (its members mostly unionists) though in later years he began to drop away from formal church attendance; and he was connected with the aristocracy through the Powerscourts. Yet it was as a leader of Irish Nationalism that Parnell established his fame. Parnell's parents separated when he was six, and as a boy he was sent to different schools in England, where he spent an unhappy youth. His father died in 1859 and he inherited the Avondale estate, while his older brother John inherited another estate in County Armagh. The young Parnell studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge (1865‚Äì69) but, due to the troubled financial circumstances of the estate he inherited, he was absent a great deal and never completed his degree. In 1871, he joined his elder brother John Howard Parnell (1843‚Äì1923), who farmed in Alabama (later an Irish Parnellite MP and heir to the Avondale estate), on an extended tour of the United States. Their travels took them mostly through the South and apparently the brothers neither spent much time in centres of Irish immigration nor sought out Irish-Americans. In 1874, he became High Sheriff of Wicklow, his home county in which he was also an officer in the Wicklow militia. He was noted as an improving landowner who played an important part in opening the south Wicklow area to industrialisation. His attention was drawn to the theme dominating the Irish political scene of the mid-1870s, Isaac Butt's Home Rule League formed in 1873 to campaign for a moderate degree of self-government. It was in support of this movement that Parnell first tried to stand for election in Wicklow, but as high sheriff was disqualified. He failed again in 1874 as home rule candidate in a County Dublin by-election. Flynn argues that the primary reason Parnell joined the Irish cause was his \\"implacable hostility towards England,\\" which probably was founded on grievances from his school days, and his mother's hostility toward England.  Political career  Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons as a Home Rule League MP for County Meath on 21 April 1875 in a by-election backed by Fenian Patrick Egan. He replaced the deceased League MP, veteran Young Irelander John Martin. He subsequently sat for the constituency of Youghal, County Cork, from 1880 until 1891. During his first year Parnell remained a reserved observer of parliamentary proceedings. He first came to attention in the public eye when in 1876 he claimed in the House of Commons that he did not believe that any murder had been committed by Fenians in Manchester. This drew the interest of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), a physical force Irish organisation that had staged a rebellion in 1867. Parnell made it his business to cultivate Fenian sentiments both in Britain and Ireland and became associated with the more radical wing of the Home Rule League, which included Joseph Biggar (MP for Cavan from 1874), John O'Connor Power (MP for County Mayo from 1874) (both, although constitutionalists, had links with the IRB), Edmund Dwyer-Gray (MP for Tipperary from 1877), and Frank Hugh O'Donnell (MP for Dungarvan from 1877). He engaged with them and played a leading role in a policy of obstructionism (i.e., the use of technical procedures to disrupt the House of Commons' ability to function) to force the House to pay more attention to Irish issues, which had previously been ignored. Obstruction involved giving lengthy speeches which were largely irrelevant to the topic at hand. This behaviour was opposed by the less aggressive chairman (leader) of the Home Rule League, Isaac Butt. Parnell visited the United States that year accompanied by O'Connor Power. The question of his closeness to the IRB, and whether indeed he ever joined the organisation, has been a matter of academic debate for a century. The evidence suggests that later, following the signing of the Kilmainham Treaty, Parnell did take the IRB oath, possibly for tactical reasons. What is known is that IRB involvement in the League's sister organisation, the Home Rule Confederation of Great Britain, led to the moderate Butt's ousting from its presidency (even though he had founded the organisation) and the election of Parnell in his place on 28 August 1877. Parnell was a restrained speaker in the House of Commons, but his organisational, analytical and tactical skills earned wide praise, enabling him to take on the British organisation's presidency. Butt died in 1879, and was replaced as chairman of the Home Rule League by the Whig-oriented William Shaw. Shaw's victory was temporary, however. =New departure= From August 1877, Parnell held a number of private meetings with prominent Fenian leaders. He visited Paris, France, where he met John O'Leary and J. J. O'Kelly both of whom were impressed by him and reported positively to the most capable and militant Leader of the American republican Clan na Gael organisation, John Devoy. In December 1877, at a reception for Michael Davitt on his release from prison, he met William Carrol who assured him of Clan na Gael's support in the struggle for Irish self-government. This led to a meeting in March 1878 between influential constitutionalists, Parnell and Frank Hugh O'Donnell, and leading Fenians O'Kelly, O'Leary and Carroll. This was followed by a telegram from John Devoy in October 1878 which offered Parnell a \\"New Departure\\" deal of separating militancy from the constitutional movement as a path to all- Ireland self-government, under certain conditions: abandonment of a federal solution in favour of separatist self-government, vigorous agitation in the land question on the basis of peasant proprietorship, exclusion of all sectarian issues, collective voting by party members and energetic resistance to coercive legislation. Parnell preferred to keep all options open without clearly committing himself when he spoke in 1879 before Irish Tenant Defence Associations at Ballinasloe and Tralee. It was not until Davitt persuaded him to address a second meeting at Westport, County Mayo in June that he began to grasp the potential of the land reform movement. At a national level several approaches were made which eventually produced the 'New Departure' of June 1879, endorsing the foregone informal agreement which asserted an understanding binding them to mutual support and a shared political agenda. In addition, the 'New Departure' asserted the Fenian movement and its armed strategies. Working together with Davitt (who was impressed by Parnell) he now took on the role of leader of the New Departure, holding platform meeting after platform meeting around the country. Throughout the autumn of 1879, he repeated the message to tenants after the long depression had left them without income for rent: =Land League leader= Parnell was elected president of Davitt's newly founded Irish National Land League in Dublin on 21 October 1879, signing a militant Land League address campaigning for land reform. In so doing, he linked the mass movement to the parliamentary agitation, with profound consequences for both of them. Andrew Kettle, his 'right-hand man', became honorary secretary. In a bout of activity, he left for America in December 1879 with John Dillon to raise funds for famine relief and secure support for Home Rule. Timothy Healy followed to cope with the press and they collected ¬£70,000 for distress in Ireland. During Parnell's highly successful tour, he had an audience with American President Rutherford B. Hayes. On 2 February 1880, he addressed the United States House of Representatives on the state of Ireland and spoke in 62 cities in the United States and in Canada. He was so well received in Toronto that Healy dubbed him \\"the uncrowned king of Ireland\\". (The same term was applied 30 years earlier to Daniel O'Connell.) He strove to retain Fenian support but insisted when asked by a reporter that he personally could not join a secret society. Central to his whole approach to politics was ambiguity in that he allowed his hearers to remain uncertain. During his tour, he seemed to be saying that there were virtually no limits. To abolish landlordism, he asserted, would be to undermine English misgovernment, and he is alleged to have added: His activities came to an abrupt end when the 1880 United Kingdom general election was announced for April and he returned to fight it. The Conservatives were defeated by the Liberal Party; William Gladstone was again Prime Minister. Sixty-three Home Rulers were elected, including twenty-seven Parnell supporters, Parnell being returned for three seats: Cork City, Mayo and Meath. He chose to sit for the Cork seat. His triumph facilitated his nomination in May in place of Shaw as leader of a new Home Rule League Party, faced with a country on the brink of a land war. Although the League discouraged violence, agrarian outrages grew from 863 incidents in 1879 to 2,590 in 1880 after evictions increased from 1,238 to 2,110 in the same period. Parnell saw the need to replace violent agitation with country-wide mass meetings and the application of Davitt's boycott, also as a means of achieving his objective of self-government. Gladstone was alarmed at the power of the Land League at the end of 1880. He attempted to defuse the land question with dual ownership in the Second Land Act of 1881, establishing a Land Commission that reduced rents and enabled some tenants to buy their farms. These halted arbitrary evictions, but not where rent was unpaid. Historian R. F. Foster argues that in the countryside the Land League \\"reinforced the politicization of rural Catholic nationalist Ireland, partly by defining that identity against urbanization, landlordism, Englishness and‚Äîimplicitly‚ÄîProtestantism.\\" =Kilmainham Treaty= Parnell's own newspaper, the United Ireland, attacked the Land Act and he was arrested on 13 October 1881, together with his party lieutenants, William O'Brien, John Dillon, Michael Davitt and Willie Redmond, who had also conducted a bitter verbal offensive. They were imprisoned under a proclaimed Coercion Act in Kilmainham Gaol for \\"sabotaging the Land Act\\", from where the No Rent Manifesto, which Parnell and the others signed, was issued calling for a national tenant farmer rent strike. The Land League was suppressed immediately. Punch magazine depicts the Fenian movement as Frankenstein's monster to Charles Parnell's Frankenstein, in the wake of the Phoenix Park killings Whilst in gaol, Parnell moved in April 1882 to make a deal with the government, negotiated through Captain William O'Shea MP, that, provided the government settled the \\"rent arrears\\" question allowing 100,000 tenants to appeal for fair rent before the land courts, then withdrawing the manifesto and undertaking to move against agrarian crime, after he realised militancy would never win Home Rule. Parnell also promised to use his good offices to quell the violence and to :co-operate cordially for the future with the Liberal Party in forwarding Liberal principles and measures of general reform. His release on 2 May, following the so-called Kilmainham Treaty, marked a critical turning point in the development of Parnell's leadership when he returned to the parameters of parliamentary and constitutional politics, and resulted in the loss of support of Devoy's American-Irish. However, his political diplomacy preserved the national Home Rule movement after the Phoenix Park killings of the Chief Secretary Lord Frederick Cavendish, and his Under-Secretary, T. H. Burke on 6 May. Parnell was shocked to the extent that he offered Gladstone to resign his seat as MP. The militant Invincibles responsible fled to the United States, which allowed him to break links with radical Land Leaguers. In the end, it resulted in a Parnell ‚Äì Gladstone alliance working closely together. Davitt and other prominent members left the IRB, and many rank-and-file Fenians drifted into the Home Rule movement. For the next 20 years, the IRB ceased to be an important force in Irish politics, leaving Parnell and his party the leaders of the nationalist movement in Ireland. =Party restructured= Another hostile Punch cartoon, from 1885, depicting the Irish National League as the \\"Irish Vampire\\", with Parnell's head Parnell now sought to use his experience and huge support to advance his pursuit of Home Rule and resurrected the suppressed Land League, on 17 October 1882, as the Irish National League (INL). It combined moderate agrarianism, a Home Rule programme with electoral functions, was hierarchical and autocratic in structure with Parnell wielding immense authority and direct parliamentary control. Parliamentary constitutionalism was the future path. The informal alliance between the new, tightly disciplined INL and the Catholic Church was one of the main factors for the revitalisation of the national Home Rule cause after 1882. Parnell saw that the explicit endorsement of Catholicism was of vital importance to the success of this venture and worked in close co- operation with the Catholic hierarchy in consolidating its hold over the Irish electorate. The leaders of the Catholic Church largely recognised the Parnellite party as guardians of church interests, despite uneasiness with a powerful lay leadership. At the end of 1885, the highly centralised organisation had 1,200 branches spread around the country, though there were fewer in Ulster than in the other provinces. Parnell left the day-to-day running of the INL in the hands of his lieutenants Timothy Harrington as Secretary, William O'Brien, editor of its newspaper United Ireland, and Tim Healy. Its continued agrarian agitation led to the passing of several Irish Land Acts that over three decades changed the face of Irish land ownership, replacing large Anglo-Irish estates with tenant ownership. Charles Stewart Parnell, the 'un-crowned King of Ireland' Parnell next turned to the Home Rule League Party, of which he was to remain the re-elected leader for over a decade, spending most of his time at Westminster, with Henry Campbell as his personal secretary. He fundamentally changed the party, replicated the INL structure within it and created a well-organised grass roots structure, introduced membership to replace \\"ad hoc\\" informal groupings in which MPs with little commitment to the party voted differently on issues, often against their own party. Or they simply did not attend the House of Commons at all (some citing expense, given that MPs were unpaid until 1911 and the journey to Westminster both costly and arduous). In 1882, he changed his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP). A central aspect of Parnell's reforms was a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats. In 1884, he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged party MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and formal party structure was unique in party politics at the time. The Irish Parliamentary Party is generally seen as the first modern British political party, its efficient structure and control contrasting with the loose rules and flexible informality found in the main British parties, which came to model themselves on the Parnellite model. The Representation of the People Act 1884 enlarged the franchise, and the IPP increased its number of MPs from 63 to 85 in the 1885 election. The changes affected the nature of candidates chosen. Under Butt, the party's MPs were a mixture of Catholic and Protestant, landlord and others, Whig, Liberal and Conservative, often leading to disagreements in policy that meant that MPs split in votes. Under Parnell, the number of Protestant and landlord MPs dwindled, as did the number of Conservatives seeking election. The parliamentary party became much more Catholic and middle class, with a large number of journalists and lawyers elected and the disappearance of Protestant Ascendancy landowners and Conservatives from it. =Push for home rule= Parnell's party emerged swiftly as a tightly disciplined and, on the whole, energetic body of parliamentarians. By 1885, he was leading a party well-poised for the next general election, his statements on Home Rule designed to secure the widest possible support. Speaking in Cork on 21 January 1885, he stated: Both British parties toyed with various suggestions for greater self-government for Ireland. In March 1885, the British cabinet rejected the proposal of radical minister Joseph Chamberlain of democratic county councils which in turn would elect a Central Board for Ireland. Gladstone on the other hand saying he was prepared to go 'rather further' than the idea of a Central Board. After the collapse of Gladstone's government in June 1885, Parnell urged the Irish voters in Britain to vote against the Liberal Party. The November general elections (delayed because boundaries were being redrawn and new registers prepared after the Third Reform Act) brought about a hung Parliament in which the Liberals with 335 seats won 86 more than the Conservatives, with a Parnellite bloc of 86 Irish Home Rule MPs holding the balance of power in the Commons. Parnell's task was now to win acceptance of the principle of a Dublin parliament. Parnell at first supported a Conservative government ‚Äì they were still the smaller party after the elections ‚Äì but after renewed agrarian distress arose when agricultural prices fell and unrest developed during 1885, Lord Salisbury's Conservative government announced coercion measures in January 1886. Parnell switched his support to the Liberals. The prospects shocked Unionists. The Orange Order, revived in the 1880s to oppose the Land League, now openly opposed Home Rule. On 20 January, the Irish Unionist Party was established in Dublin. By 28 January, Salisbury's government had resigned. The Liberal Party regained power on 1 February, their leader Gladstone ‚Äì influenced by the status of Norway, which at the time was self-governing but under the Swedish Crown ‚Äì moving towards Home Rule, which Gladstone's son Herbert revealed publicly under what became known as the \\"flying of the Hawarden Kite\\". The third Gladstone administration paved the way towards the generous response to Irish demands that the new Prime Minister had promised, but was unable to obtain the support of several key players in his own party. Lord Hartington (who had been Liberal leader in the late 1870s and was still the most likely alternative leader) refused to serve at all, while Joseph Chamberlain briefly held office then resigned when he saw the terms of the proposed bill. On 8 April 1886, Gladstone introduced the First Irish Home Rule Bill, his object to establish an Irish legislature, although large imperial issues were to be reserved to the Westminster parliament. The Conservatives now emerged as enthusiastic unionists, Lord Randolph Churchill declared, \\"The Orange card is the one to play\\". In the course of a long and fierce debate Gladstone made a remarkable Home Rule Speech, beseeching parliament to pass the bill. However, the split between pro- and anti-home rulers within the Liberal Party caused the defeat of the bill on its second reading in June by 341 to 311 votes. Parliament was dissolved and elections called, with Irish Home Rule the central issue. Gladstone hoped to repeat his triumph of 1868, when he fought and won a general election to obtain a mandate for Irish Disestablishment (which had been a major cause of dispute between Conservatives and Liberals since the 1830s), but the result of the July 1886 general election was a Liberal defeat. The Conservatives and the Liberal Unionist Party returned with a majority of 118 over the combined Gladstonian Liberals and Parnell's 85 Irish Party seats. Salisbury formed his second government ‚Äì a minority Conservative government with Liberal Unionist support. The Liberal split made the Unionists (the Liberal Unionists sat in coalition with the Conservatives after 1895 and would eventually merge with them) the dominant force in British politics until 1906, with strong support in Lancashire, Liverpool, Manchester and Birmingham (the fiefdom of its former mayor Joseph Chamberlain who as recently as 1885 had been a furious enemy of the Conservatives) and the House of Lords where many Whigs sat (a second Home Rule Bill would pass the Commons in 1893 only to be overwhelmingly defeated in the Lords). =Pigott forgeries= Parnell next became the centre of public attention when in March and April 1887 he found himself accused by the British newspaper The Times of supporting the brutal murders in May 1882 of the newly appointed Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, and the Permanent Under- Secretary, Thomas Henry Burke, in Dublin's Phoenix Park, and of the general involvement of his movement with crime (i.e., with illegal organisations such as the IRB). Letters were published which suggested Parnell was complicit in the murders. The most important one, dated 15 May 1882, ran as follows: However, a Commission of Enquiry, which Parnell had requested, revealed in February 1889, after 128 sessions that the letters were a fabrication created by Richard Pigott, a disreputable anti-Parnellite rogue journalist. Pigott broke down under cross-examination after the letter was shown to be a forgery by him with his characteristic spelling mistakes. He fled to Madrid where he committed suicide. Parnell was vindicated, to the disappointment of the Tories and the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury. The 35-volume commission report published in February 1890, did not however clear Parnell's movement of criminal involvement. Parnell then took The Times to court and the newspaper paid him ¬£5,000 () damages in an out-of-court settlement. When Parnell entered the House of Commons on 1 March 1890, after he was cleared, he received a hero's reception from his fellow MPs led by Gladstone. It had been a dangerous crisis in his career, yet Parnell had at all times remained calm, relaxed and unperturbed which greatly impressed his political friends. However, while he was vindicated in triumph, links between the Home Rule movement and militancy had been established. This he could have survived politically were it not for the crisis to follow. =Pinnacle of power= Queensland Figaro and Punch cover, 16 March 1889, depicting Irish Australians offering enthusiastic support to Parnell's struggle for Home Rule During the period 1886‚Äì90, Parnell continued to pursue Home Rule, striving to reassure British voters that it would be no threat to them. In Ireland, unionist resistance (especially after the Irish Unionist Party was formed) became increasingly organised. Parnell pursued moderate and conciliatory tenant land purchase and still hoped to retain a sizeable landlord support for home rule. During the agrarian crisis, which intensified in 1886 and launched the Plan of Campaign organised by Parnell's lieutenants, he chose in the interest of Home Rule not to associate himself with it. All that remained, it seemed, was to work out details of a new home rule bill with Gladstone. They held two meetings, one in March 1888 and a second more significant meeting at Gladstone's home in Hawarden on 18‚Äì19 December 1889. On each occasion, Parnell's demands were entirely within the accepted parameters of Liberal thinking, Gladstone noting that he was one of the best people he had known to deal with, a remarkable transition from an inmate at Kilmainham to an intimate at Hawarden in just over seven years. This was the high point of Parnell's career. In the early part of 1890, he still hoped to advance the situation on the land question, with which a substantial section of his party was displeased.  Political downfall =Divorce crisis= Parnell's leadership was first put to the test in February 1886, when he forced the candidature of Captain William O'Shea, who had negotiated the Kilmainham Treaty, for a Galway by-election. Parnell rode roughshod over his lieutenants Healy, Dillon and O'Brien who were not in favour of O'Shea. Galway was the harbinger of the fatal crisis to come. O'Shea had separated from his wife Katharine O'Shea, sometime around 1875, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance. Mrs. O'Shea acted as liaison in 1885 with Gladstone during proposals for the First Home Rule Bill. Parnell later took up residence with her in Eltham, Kent, in the summer of 1886, and was a known overnight visitor at the O'Shea house in Brockley, London. When Mrs O'Shea's aunt died in 1889, her money was left in trust. On 24 December 1889, Captain O'Shea filed for divorce, citing Parnell as co- respondent, although the case did not come for trial until 15 November 1890. The two-day trial revealed that Parnell had been the long-term lover of Mrs. O'Shea and had fathered three of her children. Meanwhile, Parnell assured the Irish Party that there was no need to fear the verdict because he would be exonerated. During January 1890, resolutions of confidence in his leadership were passed throughout the country. Parnell did not contest the divorce action at a hearing on 15 November, to ensure that it would be granted and he could marry Mrs O'Shea, so Captain O'Shea's allegations went unchallenged. A divorce decree was granted on 17 November 1890, but Parnell's two surviving children were placed in O'Shea's custody. News of the long-standing adultery created a huge public scandal. The Irish National League passed a resolution to confirm his leadership. The Catholic Church hierarchy in Ireland was shocked by Parnell's immorality and feared that he would wreck the cause of Home Rule. Besides the issue of tolerating immorality, the bishops sought to keep control of Irish Catholic politics, and they no longer trusted Parnell as an ally. The chief Catholic leader, Archbishop Walsh of Dublin, came under heavy pressure from politicians, his fellow bishops, and Cardinal Manning; Walsh finally declared against Parnell. says, \\"For the first time in Irish history, the two dominant forces of Nationalism and Catholicism came to a parting of the ways. In England one strong base of Liberal Party support was Nonconformist Protestantism, such as the Methodists; the 'nonconformist conscience' rebelled against having an adulterer play a major role in the Liberal Party. Gladstone warned that if Parnell retained the leadership, it would mean the loss of the next election, the end of their alliance, and also of Home Rule. With Parnell obdurate, the alliance collapsed in bitterness. =Party divides= When the annual party leadership election was held on 25 November, Gladstone's threat was not conveyed to the members until after they had loyally re-elected their 'chief' in his office. Gladstone published his warning in a letter the next day; subsequently, angry members demanded a new meeting, and this was called for 1 December. Parnell issued a manifesto on 29 November, saying a section of the party had lost its independence; he falsified Gladstone's terms for Home Rule and said they were inadequate. A total of 73 members were present for the fateful meeting in committee room 15 at Westminster. Leaders tried desperately to achieve a compromise in which Parnell would temporarily withdraw. Parnell refused. He vehemently insisted that the independence of the Irish party could not be compromised either by Gladstone or by the Catholic hierarchy. As chairman, he blocked any motion to remove him. On 6 December, after five days of vehement debate, a majority of 44 present led by Justin McCarthy walked out to found a new organisation, thus creating rival Parnellite and anti- Parnellite parties. The minority of 28 who remained true to their embattled 'Chief' continued in the Irish National League under John Redmond. However, all of his former close associates, Michael Davitt, John Dillon, William O'Brien and Timothy Healy deserted him to join the anti-Parnellites. The vast majority of anti-Parnellites formed the Irish National Federation, later led by John Dillon and supported by the Catholic Church. The bitterness of the split tore Ireland apart and resonated well into the next century. Parnell soon died, and his faction dissipated. The majority faction henceforth played only a minor role in British or Irish politics until the next time the UK had a hung Parliament, in 1910. =Undaunted defiance= Parnell fought back desperately, despite his failing health. On 10 December, he arrived in Dublin to a hero's welcome. He and his followers forcibly seized the offices of the party paper United Irishman. His prestige had a year before reached new heights, but the crisis crippled this support, and most rural nationalists turned against him. In the December North Kilkenny by-election, he attracted Fenian \\"hillside men\\" to his side. This ambiguity shocked former adherents, who clashed physically with his supporters; his candidate lost by almost two to one. Deposed as leader, he fought a long and fierce campaign for re- instatement. He conducted a political tour of Ireland to re-establish popular support. In a North Sligo by-election, the defeat of his candidate by 2,493 votes to 3,261 was less resounding. He fulfilled his loyalty to Katharine when they married on 25 June 1891, after Parnell had unsuccessfully sought a church wedding. On the same day, the Irish Catholic hierarchy, worried by the number of priests who had supported him in North Sligo, signed and published a near- unanimous condemnation: \\"by his public misconduct, has utterly disqualified himself to be ... leader.\\" Only Edward O'Dwyer, bishop of Limerick withheld his signature. The Parnells took up residence in Brighton. He returned to fight the third and last by-election in County Carlow, having lost the support of the Freeman's Journal when its proprietor Edmund Dwyer-Gray defected to the anti-Parnellites. At one point quicklime was thrown at his eyes by a hostile crowd in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. Parnell continued the exhausting campaigning. One loss followed another but he looked to the next general election in 1892 to restore his fortunes. On 27 September, he addressed a crowd in pouring rain at Creggs, subjecting himself to a severe soaking. On the difficult campaign trail, his health continuously deteriorated; furthermore he had kidney disease. Parnell fought on furiously but he was a dying man at age 45. Death and legacy Parnell's grave around the turn of the 20th century Parnell's grave in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin He returned to Dublin on 30 September. He died in his home at 10 Walsingham Terrace, Hove (now replaced by Dorset Court, Kingsway) on 6 October 1891 of pneumonia and in the arms of his wife Katharine. He was 45 years of age at the time of his death. Though an Anglican, his funeral on 11 October was at the Irish National nondenominational Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin, and was attended by more than 200,000 people. His notability was such that his gravestone of unhewn Wicklow granite, erected in 1940, reads only \\"Parnell\\". His brother John Howard inherited the Avondale estate. He found it heavily mortgaged and eventually sold it in 1899. Five years later, at the suggestion of Horace Plunkett it was purchased by the state. It is open to public view and is where the \\"Parnell Society\\" holds its annual August summer school. The \\"Parnell National Memorial Park\\" is in nearby Rathdrum, County Wicklow. Dublin has locations named Parnell Street and Parnell Square. At the north end of O'Connell Street stands the Parnell Monument. This was planned and organised by John Redmond, who chose the American Augustus Saint Gaudens to sculpt the statue; it was funded by Americans and completed in 1911. Art critics said it was not an artistic success. He is also commemorated on the first Sunday after the anniversary of his death on 6 October, known as Ivy Day, which originated when the mourners at his funeral in 1891, taking their cue from a wreath of ivy sent by a Cork woman \\"as the best offering she could afford\\", took ivy leaves from the walls and stuck them in their lapels. Ever after, the ivy leaf became the Parnellite emblem, worn by his followers when they gathered to honour their lost leader. Marie Owens named her firstborn son after him. Since 1991, the centenary of his death, Magdalene College, Cambridge, where Parnell studied, has offered the Parnell Fellowship in Irish Studies, which is awarded to a scholar for up to a year for study without teaching or administrative responsibilities. Parnell Fellows have often been historians, but have spanned a wide range of disciplines, including Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney. Personal life Parnell's personal political views remained an enigma. An effective communicator, he was skilfully ambivalent and matched his words depending on circumstances and audience though he would always first defend constitutionalism on which basis he sought to bring about change, though hampered thereat by the crimes that hung around the Land League and by the opposition of landlords aggravated by attacks on their property. Parnell's personal complexities or his perception of a need for political expediency to his goal permitted him to condone the radical republican and atheist Charles Bradlaugh, while he associated himself with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church. Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell's divorce crisis in 1889. Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. The historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O'Brien's Parnell, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O'Connor Power, relates, 'And, in fact, I was, about this time [1877], deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said \\"No\\" without a moment's hesitation.' He was conservative by nature, leading some historians to suggest that personally he would have been closer to the Conservative Party rather than to the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell's right-hand man, who shared a lot of his opinions, wrote of his own views, \\"I confess that I felt [in 1885], and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I ever could have towards the so-called Liberals.\\" In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O'Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature. Legacy Memorial at the junction of O'Connell Street and Parnell Street, Dublin Charles Stewart Parnell possessed the remarkable attribute of charisma, was an enigmatic personality and politically gifted, and is regarded as one of the most extraordinary figures in Irish and British politics. He played a part in the process that undermined his own Anglo-Irish caste; within two decades absentee landlords were almost unknown in Ireland. He created single-handedly in the Irish Party Britain's first modern, disciplined, political-party machine. He held all the reins of Irish nationalism and also harnessed Irish-America to finance the cause. He played an important role in the rise and fall of British governments in the mid-1880s and in Gladstone's conversion to Irish Home Rule. Over a century after his death he is still surrounded by public interest. His death, and the divorce upheaval which preceded it, gave him a public appeal and interest that other contemporaries, such as Timothy Healy or John Dillon, could not match. His leading biographer, F. S. L. Lyons, says historians emphasise numerous major achievements: Above all there is the emphasis on constitutional action, as historians point to the Land Act of 1881; the creation of the powerful third force in Parliament using a highly disciplined party that he controlled; the inclusion of Ireland in the Reform Act of 1884, while preventing any reduction in the number of Irish seats; the powerful role of the Irish National League and organising locally, especially County conventions that taught peasants about democratic self-government; forcing Home Rule to be a central issue in British politics; and persuading the great majority of the Liberal party to adopt his cause. Lyons agrees that these were remarkable achievements, but emphasises that Parnell did not accomplish them alone, but only in close coordination with men such as Gladstone and Davitt. Gladstone described him: \\"Parnell was the most remarkable man I ever met. I do not say the ablest man; I say the most remarkable and the most interesting. He was an intellectual phenomenon.\\" Liberal leader H. H. Asquith called him one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century, while Lord Haldane described him as the strongest man the House of Commons had seen in 150 years. Historian A. J. P. Taylor says, \\"More than any other man he gave Ireland the sense of being an independent nation.\\" Lyons points up the dark side as well. The decade-long liaison with Mrs. O'Shea was a disaster waiting to happen, and Parnell had made no preparations for it. He waited so long because of money ‚Äì there was an expectation that Mrs. O'Shea would receive a large inheritance from her elderly aunt who might have changed her will if she had known about the affair. In the aftermath of the divorce he fought violently to retain control in a hopeless cause. Thereby he ruined his health and wrecked his movement; it never fully recovered. The bottom line for Lyons, however, is positive: =Counterfactual speculation= Writers sometimes speculate as to what Irish history might have been if he lived.Maume, Patrick \\"A counterfactual Chief? If Parnell had lived until 1918\\" in Perhaps, had Parnell lived, the enactment of \\"All-Ireland Home Rule\\" with the consent of all of Ulster and its inclusion in an All-Ireland parliament, could have taken place. This might have pre-empted the need for Edward Carson, the Ulster leader, backed by the Ulster Covenant and his armed Ulster Volunteers, to force through a separate status for Ulster, as he did in his amending \\"exclusion of Ulster Bill\\" to the Government of Ireland Act 1914, beginning a train of events resulting in the establishment of a Northern Ireland Home Rule Government in Belfast under the Government of Ireland Act 1920. Had All- Ireland Home Rule evolved earlier, there might perhaps also have been no Easter Rising, no Anglo-Irish War, no independent twenty-six county Free State and no ensuing civil war. However, Murphy argues this to be unlikely because Unionist opposition after 1885 to any form \\"All-Ireland Home Rule\\" was extremely resilient and steadfast. The scale of Parnell's impact can be seen in the fact that Irish parties from Fianna F√°il and Fine Gael have tried to claim him as one of their own. Ultimately the O'Shea divorce issue and Parnell's premature death changed the shape of Irish politics to an extent that can be but speculated. He had been prepared to sacrifice everything for his love to Mrs. O'Shea, including the cause to which he had devoted his political life. For generations of Irish people, his life as the \\"lost leader\\" was highly dramatic and deeply tragic, against whose mythical reputation no later leader who lived a normal lifespan and who faced the practicalities of governance that Parnell never faced could hope to prevail. Portrayal in fiction In Knut Hamsun's 1892 novel Mysteries, the characters, on a couple of occasions, briefly discuss Charles Stewart Parnell, particularly in relation to Gladstone: \\"Dr. Stenerson had a high opinion of Parnell, but if Gladstone was so opposed to him, he must know what he was about‚Äîwith apologies to the host, Mr. Nagel, who couldn't forgive Gladstone for being an honourable man\\". Parnell's death shocks the character Eleanor in Virginia Woolf's novel The Years, published in 1937: \\"...how could he be dead? It was like something fading in the sky.\\" Parnell is toasted in the 1938 poem of William Butler Yeats, \\"Come Gather Round Me, Parnellites\\", while he is also referred to in \\"To a Shade\\", where he performs the famous \\"C.S.Parnell Style\\", and in Yeats' two-line poem \\"Parnell\\". In W. Somerset Maugham's The Razor's Edge, published in 1944, the author mentions Parnell and O'Shea: \\"Passion is destructive. It destroyed Antony and Cleopatra, Tristan and Isolde, Parnell and Kitty O'Shea.\\" Parnell is the subject of a discussion in Irish author James Joyce's first chapter of the semi-autobiographical novel A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, first serialised in The Egoist magazine in 1914‚Äì15. Parnell appears in \\"Ivy Day in the Committee Room\\" in Dubliners. He is also discussed in Ulysses, as is his brother. The main character in Finnegans Wake, HCE, is partially based on Parnell; among other resemblances, both are accused of transgressions in Phoenix Park. Parnell is a major background character in Thomas Flanagan's 1988 historical novel The Tenants of Time, and in Leon Uris's 1976 historical novel Trinity. Parnell was played by Clark Gable in Parnell, the 1937 MGM production about the Irish leader. Instead of wearing a full beard like the real Parnell, the popular actor sported sideburns in addition to his trademark mustache. The film is notable as Gable's biggest flop and occurred at the height of his career, when almost every Gable film was a smash hit. Parnell was portrayed by Robert Donat in the 1947 film Captain Boycott. In 1954, Patrick McGoohan played Parnell in \\"The Fall of Parnell (December 6, 1890)\\", an episode of the historical television series You Are There. In 1991, Trevor Eve played Parnell in the television mini-series Parnell and the Englishwoman. The 1992 novel Death and Nightingales by Eugene McCabe mentions him numerous times. The Irish rebel song by Dominic Behan, \\"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\\" contains a reference to Parnell: Come let me hear you tell How you slandered great Parnell, When you thought him well and truly persecuted, Where are the sneers and jeers That you bravely let us hear When our heroes of '16 were executed?

Link√∂ping University was granted full university status in 1975 and is now one of Sweden's larger academic institutions. Education, research and PhD training are the mission of four faculties: Arts and Sciences, Educational Sciences, Medicine and Health Sciences, and the Institute of Technology. In order to facilitate interdisciplinary work, there are 12 large departments combining knowledge from several disciplines and often belonging under more than one faculty. Link√∂ping University emphasises dialogue with the surrounding business sphere and the community at large, both in terms of research and education. In 2018, Link√∂ping University was home to 32,000 students and 4,000 employees. History K√•rallen building in Link√∂ping. Campus Valla. Studenthuset on Campus Valla opened in 2019.

Former logo, used until 2015. The origins of Link√∂ping University date back to the 1960s. In 1965, The Swedish National Legislative Assembly (Riksdag) decided to locate some programmes within the fields of technology and medicine to Link√∂ping. In 1967 a branch of Stockholm University was placed in Link√∂ping, offering education within humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. Two years later a unit for medical training and the Institute of Technology were established. In 1970 all activities were brought together in three faculties within the Link√∂ping University College: the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the Faculty of Medicine and the Institute of Technology. Link√∂ping University was established in 1975. In 1977 former teacher training colleges in Link√∂ping and Norrk√∂ping were transferred to Link√∂ping University and in 1986 the Faculty of Health Sciences was formed, based on the faculty of medicine and regional funded education in health care professions. In 1997 a campus was opened in the neighbouring city of Norrk√∂ping. The renowned Carl Malmsten School of Furniture (Malmstens Link√∂ping University) has been part of Link√∂ping University since 2000. After almost 60 years at the city centre, the school moved into new premises on the outskirts of Stockholm in 2009. In June 2017 the gender studies faculty arranged a workshop where humans could speed date plants and do yoga. Research Link√∂ping University pursues research and postgraduate studies within the fields of technology, medicine, and humanities, natural, educational, social and behavioural sciences. It is particularly noted for its openness to multidisciplinary research and, in 1980, was the first Swedish university to introduce interdisciplinary thematic research at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and a cross-subject, interdisciplinary perspective in graduate schools for PhD students. Link√∂ping University receives research grants from the Swedish government within five strategic research areas: IT and mobile communication, materials science, security and emergency management, e-Science and transport research. Education Link√∂ping University offers education at the basic and advanced levels via 120 study programmes, 550 single-subject courses and specialised as well as interdisciplinary postgraduate studies. A large number of the degree programmes lead to qualified professional degrees in fields such as medicine, business and economics, teacher education and engineering. Many of the programmes are interdisciplinary, combining for example industrial management and engineering, medicine and engineering, or integrating economics, law and languages. In 1986 the Faculty of Health Sciences became the first faculty in Sweden to put problem-based learning into practice within medical training and health-care programmes. In 2007, the Medical Programme and the Department of Electrical Engineering, Control systems were recognised as Centres of Excellence in Higher Education by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Education. The recognition was based on a thorough quality assessment by a panel of experts.

The lighthouse was built in 1763 by The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company to guide shipping safely to the Port of Liverpool and is the oldest lighthouse built from bricks in the United Kingdom. The lighthouse became obsolete and was closed in 1908. The last lighthouse keeper was a Mrs. Williams, the only known female lighthouse keeper of the period. History An Act of Parliament passed in 1761 allowed the Liverpool Docks Trustees to build four lighthouses. Two were built at Leasowe. These were the Upper Mockbeggar Light and Lower Mockbeggar Light. When lined up, these allowed for safe passage through \\"Rock Channel\\" to the Port of Liverpool. The former is now known as Leasowe Lighthouse, while the latter was built one quarter of a mile into the sea and was destroyed by a storm in 1769, with its replacement, Bidston Lighthouse, built in 1771 on Bidston Hill. The other two lighthouses permitted by the Act were built at Hoylake (the name Hoylake was derived from Hoyle Lake, the name of a channel of water between Hilbre Island and Dove Point, Meols) to facilitate safe access into the Hoyle Lake anchorage. Protected by a wide sandbank known as Hoyle Bank and with a water depth of about 20 feet, it provided a safe anchorage for ships. Leasowe Lighthouse was in use until 14 July 1908; by this time, the sand banks had shifted so much that Rock Channel was barely navigable, rendering the lighthouse obsolete. The lighthouse was a place of work and also a home. The last lighthouse keeper was a Mrs. Williams, the only known female lighthouse keeper in this period. Upon its closure as a lighthouse, Williams moved into a cottage but kept the lighthouse open as a tearoom during the summer months. In 1930, the lighthouse was bought by the Wallasey Corporation, in 1935 Williams died and the building was closed. The lighthouse was listed as a historic Grade II building with Historic England in 1952. A period of disrepair ensued and the lighthouse became derelict. It was then restored by a community group called \\"The Friends of Leasowe Lighthouse\\". Construction The lighthouse is a tapering cylindrical design that is one hundred and one feet tall with cavity walls that are several feet thick and a plain balcony. The construction used 660,000 hand-made bricks. It has seven floors. The original wooden staircase was replaced in 1898, with one made of cast iron that has one hundred and thirty steps. The light was originally coal-fired, but in 1772 changed to oil burning. Robert Stevenson said in 1801, while on his lighthouse tour, that the tower had \\"one reflector of silvered glass 7¬Ω feet in diameter and 13 inches focal distance\\". Later, in 1861, it was reportedly equipped with eight Argand lamps and reflectors. It was staffed by a keeper and an assistant, who resided in the tower. Location The footpath at Mockbeggar Wharf approaching Leasowe Lighthouse The lighthouse is on Leasowe Common near Mockbeggar Wharf. The Wharf takes its name from Mockbeggar Hall, which is an alternative name for the nearby Leasowe Castle. The area is in the North Wirral Coastal Park and used for recreational purposes such as walking and bird watching. Facilities The lighthouse is a community facility that is used as a location for numerous activities and is used by the ranger service of the North Wirral Coastal Park. It is used for charity abseiling events and paranormal visits, as well as for a meeting place for running groups. It has also been used by film and television companies. The lighthouse has a small visitor centre and is a focal location on the North Wirral Coastal Park. It is open on the first and third Sunday of every month for visits.

Historically within Cheshire, Leasowe was part of the old County Borough of Wallasey. It is now within the Leasowe and Moreton East Ward of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, as well as the Wallasey parliamentary constituency and the New Wallasey Regeneration programme. However, it also has its own characteristics and is often regarded as a separate town. At the 2001 census, Leasowe had a population of 6,180. By the time of the 2011 census specific figures for Leasowe were no longer maintained. The total population of the Leasowe and Moreton East Ward was 14,640. History The name 'Leasowe' comes from the Anglo-Saxon Leasowes or 'Meadow Pastures'. Its sand dunes are the largest such system on the Wirral. Much of the area is at or below sea level and is protected by the coastal embankment. Houses built in the early 20th century were often flooded and unsanitary, but after about 1926, new roads and drainage were put in by the Borough Council, and much new housing was developed. Along the embankment between Leasowe and Moreton are the remains of fortifications built during the Second World War. The world's first passenger hovercraft service operated in 1961‚Äì62. The service travelled from Moreton Common, and was advertised as between Wallasey and Rhyl in North Wales. However, the service was not profitable and soon ceased. Geography The River Fender merges with the Birket at Leasowe. The Birket then continues towards West Float at the site of the former Wallasey Pool. Landmarks=Solar School= On Leasowe Road is the first building in the world to be heated entirely by solar energy. At 53.4¬∞N, it is also the most northerly. The \\"Solar Campus\\" was formerly St George's Secondary School and was built in 1961 to the designs of Emslie Morgan, the Assistant Borough Architect, who spent a lifetime looking into ways of harnessing the sun's rays. His research resulted in a matchbox like building with, on one side a drab, windowless fa√ßade and on the other of glass, a giant solar wall. The wall is built of glass leaves two feet apart. These draw the ultra violet rays from sunshine and bounce them around the walls of the classrooms. The walls become warm and heat the air. Hardly any warmth escapes through the school's massively thick roof and walls covered with slabs of plastic foam. On the coldest days it is always 60 degrees Fahrenheit inside, and in summer the school is cooler than its more conventional neighbours, for panels inside the glass wall can be turned to deflect heat or absorb it. In practice, the large convector ducts which direct the warmed air to the colder north side of the building are a major safety hazard, and fire breaks have had to be inserted to reduce or cut off the air flow. The result is that on sunny days the south, glazed side of the building reaches unbearable temperatures in excess of 40 ¬∞C while for most of the time the unglazed north side never reaches a comfortable temperature nor receives much natural light. A secondary, small single-pipe heating system was installed to give additional heating on cold winter days with very few hours of sunlight. The system is fuelled by oil, which was cheap at the time. Today, the secondary heating has to be used very often, and is very expensive. The property is maintained by the Children & Young People's Department of the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral, which struggles to find the necessary revenue and capital to fully maintain this Grade II* listed building. =Leasowe Castle= Leasowe Castle Leasowe Castle may have been built for Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby ‚Äì a patron of Shakespeare ‚Äì in 1593, possibly (though this is disputed) as an observation platform for the Wallasey races which took place on the sands in the 16th and 17th centuries, and which are regarded as a forerunner of the Derby races. Ferdinando's brother William, the 6th Earl, was described as a noted sportsman and is remembered as a keen supporter of the Wallasey races. At first the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower. This had become disused by 1700, and it became known as \\"Mockbeggar Hall\\", a term often used for an ornate but derelict building. The term \\"Mockbeggar Wharf\\" is still used for the adjoining foreshore. The \\"Mockbeggar Hall\\" is also the name of a Wetherspoons pub in neighbouring Moreton. In 1821 ownership passed to the Cust family. After 1826 the building was used as a hotel for some years. The ceiling of the Star Chamber at the Palace of Westminster was brought to the castle in 1836 along with panelling and other furnishings; they had been salvaged from the old Palace of Westminster before the Star Chamber was demolished in an 1806 building project.http://leasowecastle.com/dine/ The Star Chamber was so called because the ceiling was decorated with bright stars. The ceiling and four tapestries depicting the four seasons still remain. Oak panelling from the Star Chamber and some made from the submerged forest along the coast were also installed. However the oak panels were removed in 1893. Between 1911 and 1970, it became a railway convalescent home, and between 1974 and 1980 it was owned by Wirral Borough Council. It reopened as a hotel in December 1982, and was acquired by Lawton Hotels Ltd in 2000. The hotel is now a popular venue for weddings and other family functions, with around 50 bedrooms. =Leasowe Lighthouse= Leasowe Lighthouse was built in 1763 by Liverpool Corporation's Docks Committee (the forerunner of the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board) and is the oldest brick-built lighthouse in Britain. According to local tradition its foundations were built on bales of cotton from a nearby shipwreck. Around 1763, William Hutchinson installed what may have been the first parabolic reflector in a lighthouse. The lighthouse was one of four lights on the North Wirral foreshore, the others being two at Hoylake and another ‚Äì a lower light ‚Äì at Leasowe. The latter was soon destroyed by the sea and was replaced by a lighthouse on Bidston Hill in 1771. The lighthouse was operational until 14 July 1908, with the only known female lighthouse keeper in those days, a Mrs. Williams. It then became a tearoom for a period, but was unused before 1989, since when it has been the base for the ranger service of the North Wirral Coastal Park. The building houses a visitor centre and is occasionally open to the public. =Leasowe Hospital= Leasowe Hospital or; The Leasowe Sanatorium For Crippled Children and Hospital for Tuberculosis, to give its full and original name, later became known as the Liverpool Open-Air Hospital, Leasowe, and finally Leasowe Hospital. To tell the story of the hospital, one name above all stands out and that is Margaret Beavan (1877-1931). She was the driving force, admired by all, she was known affectionately as the 'Little Mother of Liverpool', also not quite as complimentary ‚Äì the 'Mighty Atom' and 'Clever Beggar'. The first mention of a Sanatorium for children with Tuberculosis occurred on 16 December 1911. Slowly Leasowe Hospital changed from being principally a children's T.B. hospital to one for dealing with burns and skin grafts, and then arthritis until its closure in 1979. Another name closely associated with 'Leasowe'; amongst others, is that of (the late) Dr T.R. Littler, Consultant Rheumatologist, who was devoted to Leasowe. Leasowe Hospital was eventually bought by the Wirral Christian Centre in 1981 and was used later as a retirement home and handicap centre. After failing to make that facility work the buildings were eventually repossessed then later demolished around 2002‚Äì03. Luxury flats and houses have since been built on the site. Transport Leasowe railway station is situated on the Wirral Line of the Merseyrail network. Governance Leasowe is part of the Wallasey parliamentary constituency and represented by Angela Eagle MP. The majority of the Leasowe area is governed locally as Leasowe and Moreton East Ward. The ward takes in the Leasowe housing estate, developments along Leasowe Road and East Moreton. The ward is represented by three Labour Party Councillors: Sharon Jones, Karl Greaney and Anita Leech. Between 2008 and 2014, one of the councillors was Ian Lewis - the first-ever Conservative Councillor to represent the area on Wirral Council.

Biography He was born at Muret near Limoges. At the age of eighteen he attracted the notice of the elder Scaliger, and was invited to lecture in the archiepiscopal college at Auch. He afterwards taught Latin at Villeneuve, and then at the College of Guienne, Bordeaux, where his Latin tragedy Julius Caesar was presented. Some time before 1552 he delivered a course of lectures in the college of Cardinal Lemoine at Paris, which drew a large audience, King Henry II and his queen being among his hearers. In Paris he formed part of the larger circle of humanists and poets that included Jean Dorat and Pierre Ronsard.He published a commentary, in French, on Ronsard's Amours, 1553. He wrote almost exclusively in Latin: epigrams, odes, satires and letters, which were widely circulated before they were printed. His orations remained models for students through the eighteenth century.Orationes, et epistolae...ad usum scolarum selectae.... Venetiis: Apud Josephum Orlandelli, 1791, for example. The collection had been republished repeatedly since 1739 His success made him many enemies, and he was thrown into prison on a charge of homosexuality, but released by the intervention of powerful friends. The same accusation was brought against him at Toulouse, and he only saved his life by timely flight. The records of the town show that he was burned in effigy as a Huguenot and as sodomite (1554). After a wandering and insecure life of some years in Italy, he received and accepted the invitation of the Cardinal Ippolito II d'Este to settle in Rome in 1559. In 1561 Muretus revisited France as a member of the cardinal's suite at the conference between Roman Catholics and Protestants held at Poissy. He returned to Rome in 1563. His lectures gained him a European reputation, and in 1578 he received a tempting offer from the king of Poland to become teacher of jurisprudence in his new college at Krak√≥w. Muretus, however, who about 1576 had taken holy orders, was induced by the liberality of Gregory XIII to remain in Rome, where he died. Muretus edited a number of classical authors with learned and scholarly notes. His other works include Juvenilia et poemata varia, orationes and epistolae.

He employed the techniques and discoveries of Renaissance humanism to defend Aristotelianism against the New Learning. In spite of his contentious disposition, his contemporary reputation was high. Jacques Auguste de Thou claimed that none of the ancients could be placed above him and that he had no equal in his own time. Biography Scaliger's father, Benedetto Bordone, was a miniaturist and illuminator.Richard S. Westfall, Galileo Project biography. Scaliger himself was known in his youth by the family name Bordone, but later insisted that he was a scion of the house of La Scala, for a hundred and fifty years lords of Verona. He was born in 1484 at the Rocca di Riva, on Lake Garda. There are two accounts of his life, his own and that of his critics. =His own account= When he was twelve, his kinsman the emperor Maximilian placed him among his pages. He remained for seventeen years in the service of the emperor, distinguishing himself as a soldier and as a captain. He studied art under Albrecht D√ºrer. In 1512 at the Battle of Ravenna, where his father and elder brother were killed, his conduct earned him Order of the Golden Spur, augmented with the collar and the eagle of gold. He left the service of Maximilian, and after a brief employment by another kinsman, the duke of Ferrara, he decided to quit the military life, and in 1514 entered as a student at the University of Bologna. He decided to take holy orders, expecting that he would become cardinal, and then pope, when he would wrest from the Venetians his duchy of Verona, which the republic had taken from his ancestors. He soon gave up this plan, but remained at the university until 1519. The next six years he passed at the castle of Vico Nuovo, in Piedmont, as a guest of the Della Rovere, at first dividing his time between military expeditions in the summer, and study, chiefly of medicine and natural history, in the winter, until a severe attack of rheumatic gout brought his military career to a close. Henceforth his life was wholly devoted to study. In 1525 he accompanied Antonio della Rovera, bishop of Agen, to that city as his physician. =Later account= It was not until some time after his death that the enemies of his son first alleged that he was not of the family of La Scala, but was the son of Benedetto Bordone, an illuminator or schoolmaster of Verona; that he was educated at Padua, where he took the degree of M.D.; and that the story of his life before arriving at Agen was pure invention. It is supported by no other evidence than his own statements, some of which are inconsistent with well-ascertained facts. =Life at Agen= The remaining thirty-two years of his life were passed almost wholly at Agen. On his death in 1558 he had a high scientific and literary reputation, though his books gave rise to disputes. He was charged with heresy in 1538 but was acquitted, one of the judges being his friend Arnoul Le Ferron. Scaliger died at Agen in 1558. Works In 1531 he printed his first oration against Erasmus, in defence of Cicero and the Ciceronians (Oratio pro Cicerone contra Erasmum, Paris 1531), dismissing Erasmus as a literary parasite, a mere corrector of texts. It is notable for its vigorous invective and, like his subsequent writings, its excellent Latin. It has been said of it, however, that it misses the point of his opponent's treatise Ciceronianus. Erasmus did not reply, thinking it was the work of a personal enemy, Meander. Scaliger then wrote a second oration (published in 1536), also full of invective. The orations were followed by a large amount of Latin verse, which appeared in successive volumes in 1533, 1534, 1539, 1546 and 1547. This verse appeared in numerous editions, but was less appreciated by later critics. (One of them, Mark Pattison, agreed with the judgment of Pierre Daniel Huet, who said: \\"par ses po√©sies brutes et informes Scaliger a d√©shonor√© le Parnasse\\".) He also published a brief tract on comic metres (De comicis dimensionibus) and a work De causis linguae Latinae (Lyons 1540; Geneva 1580; Frankfurt 1623), in which he analyzes the style of Cicero and indicates 634 mistakes of Lorenzo Valla and his humanist predecessors, claimed to be the earliest Latin grammar using scientific principles and method. He published no other purely literary works in his lifetime. His Poetices libri septem (\\"Seven books on Poetics\\", Lyons 1561; Leyden 1581) appeared after his death. They contained many paradoxes and some elements of personal animosity (especially in his reference to Etienne Dolet), but also contain acute criticism based on the Poetics of Aristotle, \\"imperator noster; omnium bonarum artium dictator perpetuus\\" (\\"our Emperor, dictator forever of all good qualities in the arts\\"), an influential treatise in the history of literary criticism. Like many of his generation Scaliger prized Virgil above Homer. His praise of the tragedies of Seneca over those of the Greeks influenced both Shakespeare and Pierre Corneille. Scaliger intended to be judged primarily as a philosopher and a man of science and regarded classical studies as a means of relaxation. He was noted for his powers of observation and his tenacious memory. His scientific writings are all in the form of commentaries. It was not until he was seventy that (with the exception of a brief tract on the De insomniis of Hippocrates) he felt that any of them were ready for publication. In 1556 he printed his Dialogue on the De plantis attributed to Aristotle, and in 1557 his Exotericarum exercitationum (\\"Exoteric Exercises\\", or simply Exercitationes) on Gerolamo Cardano's De Subtilitate. His other scientific works, commentaries on Theophrastus' De causis plantarum and Aristotle's History of Animals, he left in a more or less unfinished state, and they were not printed until after his death. His work shows no sign of the inductive reasoning attributed to the scientific method. Unlike his contemporary Konrad von Gesner, he was not led by his botanical studies to a natural system of classification. He rejected the discoveries of Copernicus. He was guided by Aristotle in metaphysics and in natural history and by Galen in medicine, but did not follow them uncritically. He is best known for his critical Exotericarum Exercitationes on Cardan's De Subtilitate (1557), a book approaching natural philosophy and which had a long popularity.Julii Caesaris Scaligeri Exotericarum exercitationum liber XV. De Subtilitate ad Hieronymum Cardanum. Francofurti. Apud Claudium Marnium, & haeredes Ioannes Aubrii. M. DC. VII. [= 1607] (online version). The Exercitationes display encyclopaedic knowledge and accurate observation; but, as noted by Gabriel Naud√©, they are not flawless. They had an influence upon natural historians, philosophers and scientists such as Lipsius, Francis Bacon, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz and Johannes Kepler.Herman H.J. Lynge & Sons, International Antiquarian Booksellers \\"Renaissance Enlightenment ‚Äì Defending Aristotle Against Cardano\\" Charles Nisard wrote that Scaliger's object seems to be to deny all that Cardan affirms and to affirm all that Cardan denies. Yet Leibniz and Sir William Hamilton recognize him as the best modern exponent of the physics and metaphysics of Aristotle. Family A few days after his arrival at Agen he fell in love with an orphan of thirteen, Andiette de Roques Lobejac; she was a distant relative of the aristocratic house of Rochepozay (also Roche-Pozay or Roche-Posay),The Roman Stamp: Frame and Facade in Some Forms of Neo-Classicism, Robert M. Adams, University of California Press, 1974, pg 60 associates of Jacques Auguste de Thou, one of Scaliger's close friends and supporters.Thuanus: The Making of Jacques-Auguste de Thou (1553‚Äì1617), Ingrid A. R. de Smet, Librairie Droz S.A., 2006, pg 87, 89, 133 Her friends objected to her marriage, as he was then undistinguished. By 1528 he was a successful physician and at forty-five he married Andiette, who was then sixteen. The marriage lasted for twenty-nine years and produced fifteen children, including Joseph Justus Scaliger.

ALSA is part of the Linux kernel, while PulseAudio is middleware, a part of the lower levels of the desktop stack. So is SDL. Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) is a software framework and part of the Linux kernel that provides an application programming interface (API) for sound card device drivers. Some of the goals of the ALSA project at its inception were automatic configuration of sound-card hardware and graceful handling of multiple sound devices in a system. ALSA is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The sound servers PulseAudio and JACK (low-latency professional-grade audio editing and mixing), the higher-level abstraction APIs OpenAL, SDL audio, etc. work on top of ALSA and implemented sound card device drivers. On Linux systems, ALSA succeeded the older Open Sound System (OSS). History The project to develop ALSA was led by Jaroslav Kysela, and was based on the Linux device driver for the Gravis Ultrasound sound card. It started in 1998 and was developed separately from the Linux kernel until it was introduced in the 2.5 development series in 2002 (2.5.4‚Äì2.5.5). In the 2.6 version, it replaced the previous system, Open Sound System (OSS), by default (although a backwards- compatibility layer does exist). ALSA has a larger and more complex API than OSS, so it can be more difficult to develop an application that uses ALSA as its sound technology. While ALSA may be configured to provide an OSS emulation layer, such functionality is no longer available or is not installed by default in many Linux distributions. Interactions between different parts of Linux sound output stack Features ALSA was designed with some features which were not, at the time of its conception, supported by OSS: * Hardware- based MIDI synthesis. * Hardware mixing of multiple channels. * Full-duplex operation. * Multiprocessor-friendly, thread-safe device drivers. Besides the sound device drivers, ALSA bundles a user-space library for application developers who want to use driver features through an interface that is higher-level than the interface provided for direct interaction with the kernel drivers. Unlike the kernel API, which tries to reflect the capabilities of the hardware directly, ALSA's user-space library presents an abstraction that remains as standardized as possible across disparate underlying hardware elements. This goal is achieved in part by using software plug-ins; for example, many modern sound cards or built-in sound chips do not have a \\"master volume\\" control. Instead, for these devices, the user space library provides a software volume control using the \\"softvol\\" plug-in, and ordinary application software need not care whether such a control is implemented by underlying hardware or software emulation of such underlying hardware. =Applications= Additional to the software framework internal to the Linux kernel, the ALSA project also provides the command-line utilities \`alsactl\`, \`amixer\`, \`arecord/aplay\` and \`alsamixer\`, an ncurses-based TUI. There also are GUIs programmed by third-party developers, such as gnome-alsamixer (using GTK+), kmix, xfce4-mixer, lxpanel, qashctl, pavucontrol, alsamixergui (using FLTK) and probably even more. Concepts This section provides an overview of basic concepts pertaining to ALSA. Typically, ALSA supports up to eight cards, numbered 0 through 7; each card is a physical or logical kernel device capable of input and output. Furthermore, each card may also be addressed by its id, which is an explanatory string such as \\"Headset\\" or \\"ICH9\\". A card has devices, numbered starting at 0; a device may be of playback type, meaning it outputs sound from the computer, or some other type such as capture, control, timer, or sequencer; device number 0 is used by default when no particular device is specified. A device may have subdevices, numbered starting at 0; a subdevice represents some relevant sound endpoint for the device, such as a speaker pair. If the subdevice is not specified, or if subdevice number ‚àí1 is specified, then any available subdevice is used. A card's interface is a description of an ALSA protocol for accessing the card; possible interfaces include: hw, plughw, default, and plug:dmix. The hw interface provides direct access to the kernel device, but no software mixing or stream adaptation support. The plughw and default enable sound output where the hw interface would produce an error. An application typically describes sound output by combining all of the aforementioned specifications together in a device string, which has one of the following forms (which are case-sensitive): * interface:card,device,subdevice * interface:CARD=1,DEV=3,SUBDEV=2. An ALSA stream is a data flow representing sound; the most common stream format is PCM that must be produced in such a way as to match the characteristics or parameters of the hardware, including: * sampling rate: often 44.1 kHz on home stereos, or 48 kHz on home theaters, yet up to 88.2 kHz, 96 kHz, or even 192 kHz for hi-fi audio production or reproduction. * sample width: measured in some number of bits per sample (such as 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits/sample) * sample encoding: such as endianness * number of channels: 1 for mono, 2 for stereo, or 6 for AC-3/IEC958 Implementations The ALSA System on Chip (ASoC) layer aims to provide better support for ALSA on embedded systems that use a system- on-chip (SoC) design.

It is based on standard Unix devices system calls (i.e. POSIX read, write, ioctl, etc.). The term also sometimes refers to the software in a Unix kernel that provides the OSS interface; it can be thought of as a device driver (or a collection of device drivers) for sound controller hardware. The goal of OSS is to allow the writing of sound-based applications that are agnostic of the underlying sound hardware. OSS was created by Hannu Savolainen and is distributed under four license options, three of which are free software licences, thus making OSS free software.  API  The API is designed to use the traditional Unix framework of open(), read(), write(), and ioctl(), via special devices. For instance, the default device for sound input and output is /dev/dsp. Examples using the shell: cat /dev/random > /dev/dsp # plays white noise through the speaker cat /dev/dsp > a.a # reads data from the microphone and copies it to file a.a  Free, proprietary, free  The project was initially free software, but following the project's success, Savolainen was contracted by the company 4Front Technologies and made his support for newer sound devices and improvements proprietary. In response, eventually the Linux community abandoned the OSS/free implementation included in the kernel and development effort switched to the replacement Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). Some Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu, have chosen to disable OSS support in their kernels and ignore any bugs filed against OSS4 packages (although OSS support may be re-enabled on UbuntuOSS4 re-enabling instructions for Ubuntu). In spite of this, several operating systems, such as FreeBSD, continued to distribute previous versions of OSS, and continue to maintain and improve these versions. In July 2007, 4Front Technologies released sources for OSS under CDDL for OpenSolaris and GPL for Linux. In January 2008, 4Front Technologies released OSS for FreeBSD (and other BSD systems) under the BSD License.  Other implementations  FreeBSD contains an independently developed implementation of the OSS API, which includes, among other things, in-kernel resampling, mixing (vchans), equalizer, surround sound, and independent volume control for each application. It also supports bit-perfect mode. NetBSD and OpenBSD support a compatibility mode for the OSS API, by providing the \`soundcard.h\` header file and the \`libossaudio\` library, which internally operate using the native Sun-like audio interface. Solaris and OpenSolaris uses a fork of OSS4 called Boomer. It combines the OSS4 framework (audio and mixer) together with Sun's earlier SADA(/dev/audio) API.  OSS/3D  OSS/3D is a plugin for music players, which acts as an audio postprocessing engine. Supported players include Winamp, Windows Media Player (9 or later), musicmatch, Sonique, Foobar2000, JetAudio, XMMS. It is ported to Windows and Linux platforms. Unlike the OSS, it is shareware. 4Front OSS3D was later renamed to Joesoft Hear.  OSS in relation to ALSA  In the Linux kernel, there have historically been two uniform sound APIs used. One is OSS; the other is ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture). ALSA is available for Linux only, and as there is only one implementation of the ALSA interface, ALSA refers equally to that implementation and to the interface itself. OSS was the only audio API in Linux up through the 2.4 series of official (kernel.org) Linux kernels. ALSA was added starting with 2.5, and in those versions, Linux kernel authors marked OSS as deprecated. 4Front continued to develop OSS outside the Linux kernel. ALSA provides an optional OSS emulation mode that appears to programs as if it were OSS. Similarly, there was an ALSA emulation mode in the Linux implementation of OSS. OSS both as API and as software has been criticized by some developers, such as Paul Davis (of JACK Audio Connection Kit) and Lennart Poettering (of competing PulseAudio).http://equalarea.com/paul/alsa- audio.htmlhttps://lwn.net/Articles/450299/ Most of these criticisms were either specific to the Linux implementation and not to the OSS API itself, or have been addressed in OSS version 4.

It is used in many free audio software projects and there is a wide range of LADSPA plug-ins available. LADSPA exists primarily as a header file written in the programming language C. There are many audio plugin standards and most major modern software synthesizers and sound editors support a variety. The best known standard is probably Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology. LADSPA is unusual in that it attempts to provide only the \\"Greatest Common Divisor\\" of other standards. This means that its scope is limited, but it is simple and plugins written using it are easy to embed in many other programs.

Alp√≠n was included in a pedigree chart created in the 10th century to connect the kings of Alba (Scotland) to legendary D√°l Skondren and Irish ancestors. In this pedigree, Alp√≠n's father is Eochaid, an Irish name, yet he becomes the father of Cin√°ed (Kenneth Skondre) and Domnall mac Ailp√≠n. Cin√°ed and Alp√≠n are the names of Pictish kings in the 8th century: the brothers Ciniod and Elphin who ruled from 763 to 780. Alp√≠n's alleged father Eochaid IV is not mentioned in any contemporary source.Alex Woolf, From Pictland to Alba 789-1070 (Edinburgh University Press 2008), pp. 96, 220-1. Weir states that Alp√≠n succeeded his father Eochaid IV as King 'of Scotland' (D√°l Riata), and also became King of Kintyre in March/August 834,Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 165 thus establishing his power over a wide area of Scotland.  Parentage and death  The Chronicle of the Scottish historian John of Fordun records the succession of \\"Alpin the son of Achay\\" in 831, his reign of three years, and his defeat by the Picts \\"20 July\\".John of Fordun (Skene), Book IV, II, p. 135. The 12th century Cronica Regum Scottorum lists \\"Alpin filius Eochal venenosi iii, Kynedus filius Alpini primus rex Scottorum xvi‚Ä¶\\" as kings, dated to the 9th century.Skene (1867), XVI, Chronicle of the Scots 1165, Cronica Regum Scottorum, p. 131. Alp√≠n's parentage is not stated in any of the earlier chronicles. Alp√≠n's mother was the sister and heiress of Causant√≠n mac Fergusa, King of the Picts. Alp√≠n married a 'Scottish Princess', and fathered two sons. Alp√≠n is chiefly remembered for his fatal war with the Picts, who had seized upon and arrogated the Kingdom. Alp√≠n resolved to remove the king, and met him with his forces near a village of Angus, where the fight was maintained with great obstinacy, till the Pictish king was slain, whereby the Scots got the victory. However, a new king of \\"high descent and noble achievements\\" (possibly Drest) was elected king of the Picts, and turned the scale, and at Galloway defeated and took King Alp√≠n, anno 834, and put him with many of his nobles to death. It is said that Alp√≠n's head was fastened to a pole, and carried about the Pictish army, and at last set up for spectacle in Abernethy, their chief town, which was afterwards severely revenged by the Scots, who called the place where he was slain Bas Alpin. Alp√≠n mac Skondre died on 20 July or in August 834 when he was either killed whilst fighting the Picts in Galloway or beheaded after the battle. His place of burial is not recorded.

The title was first adopted by Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby, under a creation of 1139. It continued with the Ferrers family until the 6th Earl forfeited his property toward the end of the reign of Henry III and died in 1279. Most of the Ferrers property and (by a creation in 1337) the Derby title were then held by the family of Henry III. The title merged in the Crown upon Henry IV's accession to the throne in 1399. The title was created again, this time for the Stanley family, in 1485. Lord Derby's subsidiary titles are Baron Stanley of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster (created 1832), and Baron Stanley of Preston in the County Palatine of Lancaster (1886). The courtesy title of the heir apparent is Lord Stanley. The 1st to 5th Earls also held an earlier Barony of Stanley, created for the 1st Earl's father in 1456 and currently abeyant; the 2nd to 5th Earls held the Barony of Strange created in 1299, currently held by the Viscounts St Davids; and the 7th to 9th Earls held another Barony of Strange, created in error in 1628 and currently held independently of other peerages. Several successive generations of the Stanley Earls, along with other members of the family, have been prominent members of the Conservative Party, and at least one historian has suggested that this family rivals the Cecils (Marquesses of Salisbury) as the single most important family in the party's history. They were at times one of the richest landowning families in England. The Stanley Cup, the championship trophy of the National Hockey League, was presented to the Dominion of Canada in 1892 by Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, during his tenure as Governor General of Canada. The family seat is Knowsley Hall, near Liverpool, Merseyside. Ferrers Creation Ferri√®res in Normandy, the hometown of the de Ferrers family, was an important centre for iron () and takes its name from the iron ore mines used during the Gallo-Roman period. Lord of Longueville, Normandy, and a Domesday Commissioner; he built Tutbury Castle and Duffield Castle and had large holdings in Derbyshire as well as 17 other counties. Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby (1062‚Äì1139) was created Earl of Derby by King Stephen in 1138 for his valiant conduct at the Battle of Northallerton. He was married to Hawise de Vitre and died in 1139. His son Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby (?‚Äìbef.1160) became the next earl and was married to Margaret Peverel. He founded Darley Abbey and Merevale Abbey. His son William de Ferrers, 3rd Earl of Derby (died 1190) was married to Sybil de Braose. He rebelled against King Henry II and was imprisoned at Caen, Normandy. He died in the Crusades at the Siege of Acre. He was succeeded by his son William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby (died 1247) who married Agnes de Kevelioc (also known as Agnes of Chester), daughter of Hugh de Kevelioc, 3rd Earl of Chester. He was succeeded by his son William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (died 1254) who married Sibyl Marshall and then Margaret de Quincy with whom he had his son and heir Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby (1239‚Äì1279), who became the next Earl. He rebelled against King Henry III and was arrested and imprisoned first in the Tower of London, then in Windsor Castle and Wallingford Castle, and in 1266 his lands and earldom were forfeited, including Tutbury Castle which still belongs to the Duchy of Lancaster. Through one line the descent of the Earls of Derby eventually gave rise to the Earls Ferrers. Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers, was the only peer of the realm to be hanged for murder. Another familial line takes in the Baron Ferrers of Chartley descent. Creation of Edward III The large estates which were taken from Robert in 1266 were given by Henry III to his son, Edmund Crouchback; and his son, Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, also called himself Earl Ferrers. In 1337 Edmund's grandson, Henry of Grosmont (c. 1310 ‚Äì 1361), afterwards Duke of Lancaster, was created Earl of Derby, and this title was taken by Edward III's son, John of Gaunt, who had married Henry's daughter, Blanche. John of Gaunt's son and successor was Henry Bolingbroke, who acceded to the throne as Henry IV in 1399. The title Earl of Derby then merged in the Crown. The Stanley Creation Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby The Stanley family was descended from Ligulf of Aldithley, who was also the ancestor of the Audleys (see Audley-Stanley family). One of his descendants married an heiress whose marriage portion included Stoneley, Staffordshire ‚Äì hence the name Stanley. Sir Thomas Stanley served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland and represented Lancashire in the House of Commons. In 1456 he was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Stanley. His eldest son Thomas Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley, married Lady Margaret Beaufort, the mother of King Henry VII, and also Eleanor Nevill. The title of Earl of Derby was conferred on him in 1485 by his stepson Henry VII after the Battle of Bosworth Field where Thomas decided not to support King Richard III. The title derives from the family's extensive lands in the hundred of West Derby, Lancashire, and not the county or city of Derby. His eldest son and heir apparent George Stanley, Lord Stanley (commonly called Lord Strange), married Joan Strange, 9th Baroness Strange and 5th Baroness Mohun, and was summoned to the House of Lords as Lord Strange in right of his wife. Lord Derby was succeeded by his grandson Thomas, the eldest son of Lord Strange. He had already succeeded his mother as tenth Baron Strange and sixth Baron Mohun. He married Anne Hastings, daughter of Lord Hungerford and Hastings. The second Earl's son Edward became the 3rd Earl. He notably served as Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Mary of England in 1553 and was Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire. Lord Derby was married four times. His second wife Dorothy Howard, daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, supplied his heir Henry, the fourth Earl. He served as Ambassador to France and was one of the peers at the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1586. Lord Derby married Margaret Clifford, daughter of Henry Clifford, 2nd Earl of Cumberland, and his wife Eleanor, younger daughter of Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and his wife Mary Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII. Both Lord Derby's sons succeeded to the earldom. The eldest son Ferdinando, the fifth Earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Strange in 1589. He also built Leasowe Castle, probably as an observation platform for watching horse races on the nearby sands. Lord Derby married Alice Spencer, but was without male issue. He died under mysterious circumstances and some have claimed that he was poisoned in order to prevent him from staking a claim to the throne of England through his maternal grandmother. On his death the baronies of Stanley, Strange and Mohun fell into abeyance between his three daughters. James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. Remembered in the Isle of Man as: Yn Stanlagh Mooar (the Great Stanley). He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother William, the sixth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and Cheshire and purchased from his nieces their claims in the Isle of Man. William married Elizabeth de Vere daughter of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Their son James succeeded to the earldom on his father's death. In 1628, during his father's lifetime, he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration as Lord Strange, as it was believed that his father held this title. When it was discovered that this was a mistake, the House of Lords decided that there were two baronies of Strange, the original 1299 creation and the new, 1628 creation. James was a staunch Royalist. In 1643 he moved to the Isle of Man and established it as a Royalist stronghold. He was beheaded in Bolton, Lancashire by the Parliament forces in 1651. His wife was Charlotte de la Tr√©mouille, daughter of Claude de la Tr√©moille, Duc de Thouars, who is known as the heroine who defended Lathom House in 1644 and the Isle of Man in 1651. Their son Charles became the 8th Earl. He served as Lord Lieutenant of both Cheshire and Lancashire. Lord Derby married Dorothea Helena Kirkhoven, daughter of Jehan Kirkhoven, Lord of Heenvliet (in South Holland) and Baron de Rupa of the Netherlands. They had two sons who both succeeded to the earldom. The 8th Earl's eldest son William Richard George became the 9th Earl. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire. He married Elizabeth Butler, daughter of Thomas Butler, Earl of Ossory, and sister of James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde. He had two daughters and one son. He outlived his son and on his death in 1702 the barony of Strange fell into abeyance between his daughters. He was succeeded in the earldom by his younger brother, James, the tenth Earl. He was a politician and served as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard. Like many of his predecessors he was also Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire and Lancashire. In 1732 he succeeded his great-niece as 6th Baron Strange. Lord Derby was childless and on his death in 1736 the male line of the second Earl died out. He was succeeded in the barony of Strange, which could be passed on through female lines, by his first cousin once removed, James Murray, 2nd Duke of Atholl. The earldom was inherited by his distant relative Sir Edward Stanley, 5th Baronet, of Bickerstaffe, a descendant of a younger brother of the second Earl, who became the 11th Earl of Derby (see below for earlier history of the Baronetcy). He had previously represented Lancashire in Parliament and after he succeeded in the earldom he served as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. Lord Derby married Elizabeth Hesketh. His residence was Bickerstaffe Hall near Ormskirk, Lancashire. The 11th Earl's younger brother was the Hon. and Rev. John Stanley, Rector of Bury Parish Church 1743‚Äì1778. Edward's eldest son, James, Lord Stanley, was commonly called Lord Strange. Edward outlived James (who died in 1771) and was succeeded by James' son Edward, the 12th Earl. He held political office as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and also founded The Derby horse-race. Lord Derby married Lady Elizabeth Hamilton, daughter of James Hamilton, 6th Duke of Hamilton. His second marriage was to a Drury Lane actress, Elizabeth Farren. The 12th Earl's first marriage produced his heir Edward, the thirteenth Earl. He represented Preston and Lancashire in the House of Commons and in 1832, two years before he succeeded his father, he was raised to the peerage in his own right as Baron Stanley, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster. Lord Derby was also a natural historian and his zoological collections founded Liverpool Museum. He was also a patron of the arts, especially of the poet Edward Lear who wrote The Owl and the Pussycat for the Earl's children. He was married to Charlotte Hornby. In 1844, he had a church built on the Knowsley Estate, St. Mary the Virgin, where several Stanleys found their final resting place. Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby His son, Edward, succeeded him to become the 14th Earl. He is the most famous of the Earls of Derby. Known as a great parliamentary orator, he sat as Member of Parliament for Stockbridge, a seat bought by his father, Windsor and Lancashire North. In 1844 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Stanley. Although at first a Whig, he later became a Tory and served three times Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Lord Derby was married to Emma Wilbraham daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Baron Skelmersdale. They had a daughter and two sons, both of whom succeeded to the earldom. The eldest son Edward Henry, was a prominent politician and served under his father as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Foreign Secretary. He became Foreign Secretary again under Benjamin Disraeli. In 1880 he joined the Liberal Party and was Colonial Secretary under William Gladstone between 1882 and 1885. Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby His younger brother and successor, Frederick Arthur Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby, was a Conservative politician and held office as Secretary of State for War, as Colonial Secretary and as President of the Board of Trade. In 1886, seven years before succeeding his brother, he was raised to the peerage in his own right as Baron Stanley of Preston, in the County Palatine of Lancaster. He was also Governor-General of Canada between 1888 and 1893. In 1892, he purchased and donated the Stanley Cup, to be awarded to the \\"championship hockey club of the Dominion of Canada\\" each year. Lord Derby was married to Lady Constance Villiers, daughter of George William Villiers, 4th Earl of Clarendon. He was succeeded by his son Edward, the seventeenth Earl. Like many of his ancestors he was a politician and notably served as Secretary of State for War. He was also Ambassador to France, and during this time followed his father's lead by donating the Lord Derby Cup, given each year to the winners of the French rugby league knockout competition. Lord Derby married Alice Montagu daughter of William Drogo Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester. A pair of Memorial Gates were erected in 1958 on Knowsley Lane on the Knowsley Estate in his memory. His two sons, Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley, and the Hon. Oliver Stanley both became Conservative politicians and served together in the same cabinet in 1938. Lord Derby outlived his eldest son and was succeeded by his grandson Edward, the eldest son of Lord Stanley, who became the 18th Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire and also established Knowsley Safari Park in 1971. He married to Isabel Miles-Lade, but died childless. the titles are held by his nephew Edward Richard William Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby. He is the son of Hugh Henry Montagu Stanley, younger brother of the 18th Earl. The Stanley Baronetcy, of Bickerstaffe in the County Palatine of Lancaster, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1627 for Edward Stanley. He was the great- grandson of the Hon. Sir James Stanley, of Cross Hall, Lathom, younger brother of the second Earl of Derby. This branch of the family is known as the \\"Stanleys of Bickerstaffe\\". Sir Edward Stanley's great-grandson, the fourth Baronet, represented Preston in Parliament. His son, the aforementioned fifth Baronet, succeeded as eleventh Earl of Derby in 1736. For further history of the baronetcy, see above. James Stanley, son of the first Earl, became Bishop of Ely in 1506. He sent a small army into the Battle of Flodden, commanded by his alleged son Sir John Stanley who later entered the monastery of Westminster Abbey. Edward Stanley, a descendant of Peter Stanley, younger son of the second Baronet, sat as Member of Parliament for Somerset West and Bridgwater. The Earl of Derby owns Knowsley Hall and Greenhalgh Castle; they were the Lords of Mann, i.e. of the Isle of Man from 1405 until 1594. Several Earls of Derby are buried in St. Mary's Church, Knowsley. Others are buried in the Derby Chapel at Ormskirk Parish Church. The Barons Stanley of Alderley are members of another branch of the Stanley family. They are descended from the Hon. Sir John Stanley, third son of the first Baron Stanley. Also, Edward Stanley, 1st Baron Monteagle, was the younger son of the first Earl of Derby.

Computer software that can create sounds or music is not new, but advances in processing speed now allow softsynths to accomplish the same tasks that previously required the dedicated hardware of a conventional synthesizer. Softsynths may be readily interfaced with other music software such as music sequencers typically in the context of a digital audio workstation. Softsynths are usually less expensive and can be more portable than dedicated hardware. Types Bristol Mini soft-synth Softsynths can cover a range of synthesis methods, including subtractive synthesis (including analog modeling, a subtype), FM synthesis (including the similar phase distortion synthesis), physical modelling synthesis, additive synthesis (including the related resynthesis), and sample-based synthesis. Many popular hardware synthesizers are no longer manufactured but have been emulated in software. The emulation can even extend to having graphics that model the exact placements of the original hardware controls. Some simulators can even import the original sound patches with accuracy that is nearly indistinguishable from the original synthesizer. Popular synthesizers such as the Minimoog, Yamaha DX7, Korg M1, Prophet-5, Oberheim OB-X, Roland Jupiter 8, ARP 2600 and dozens of other classics have been recreated in software. Some softsynths are heavily sample- based, and frequently have more capability than hardware units, since computers have fewer restrictions on memory than dedicated hardware synthesizers. Some of these sample-based synthesizers come with sample libraries many gigabytes in size. Some are specifically designed to mimic real-world instruments such as pianos. Many sample libraries are available in a common format like .wav, .sf or .sf2, and can be used with almost any sampler-based softsynth. The major downside of using softsynths can often be more latency (delay between playing the note and hearing the corresponding sound). Decreasing latency requires increasing the demand on the computer's processor. When the soft synthesizer is running as a plug-in for a host sequencer, both the soft synth and the sequencer are competing for processor time. Multi-processor computers can handle this better than single-processor computers. As the processor becomes overloaded, sonic artifacts such as \\"clicks\\" and \\"pops\\" can be heard during performance or playback. When the processor becomes completely overloaded, the host sequencer or computer can lock up or crash. Increasing buffer size helps, but also increases latency. However modern professional audio interfaces can frequently operate with extremely low latency, so in recent years this has become much less of a problem than in the early days of computer music. It is also possible to generate sound files offline, meaning sound generation does not have to be in real time, or live. For example, the input could be a MIDI file and the output could be a WAV file or an MP3 file. Playing a WAV or MP3 file simply means playing a precalculated waveform. The advantage of offline synthesis is that the software can spend as much time as it needs to generate the resulting sounds, potentially increasing sound quality. It could take 30 seconds of computing time to generate 1 second of real-time sound, for example. The disadvantage is that changes to the music specifications cannot be heard immediately. Often a composer or virtual conductor will want a \\"draft mode\\" for initial score editing and then use the \\"production mode\\" to generate high- quality sound as one gets closer to the final version. The draft mode allows for quicker turn-around, perhaps in real time, but will not have the full quality of the production mode. The draft render is roughly analogous to a wire-frame or \\"big polygon\\" animation when creating 3D animation or CGI. Both are based on the trade-off between quality and turn-around time for reviewing drafts and changes. =Software instrument= Software instruments bottom: Software effect processors on Cubase 6 A software instrument can be a synthesized version of a real instrument (like the sounds of a violin or drums), or a unique instrument, generated by computer software. Software instruments have been made popular by the convergence of synthesizers and computers, as well as sequencing software like GarageBand, Logic Pro (geared toward professionals), the open source project Audacity, and Ableton Live which is geared towards live performances. Also of note is software like Csound and Nyquist, which can be used to program software instruments. A software instrument is akin to a soundfont. Plugin compatibility Stand-alone softsynths run as a program on the computer so additional software is not required. Plugin softsynths require a host application such as a digital audio workstation, which records the music that is played. Common plugin technologies include VST, AU, and LADSPA. Comparison to digital hardware synthesizers Software synthesizers can have more advanced algorithms than digital hardware synthesizers due to the much greater processing speed (as well as support for floating point processing and greater than 24-bit word size) of the x86-64 CPUs that modern music production personal computers have over the digital signal processors found in common hardware synthesizers. The advantage to dedicated hardware is that it can be more stable, and also that it often has a user interface that is physical (knobs and sliders) and therefore easier to manipulate during performances. Many softsynths use mathematical algorithms that directly emulate the electronic components and circuitry of the original hardware synthesizer. This produces an exceptionally authentic sound, even capturing flaws in the original hardware, such as oscillator drift caused by thermal sensitivity of the components.

It can generate polyphonic, multitimbral, microtonal sounds in realtime. It is a free program, licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License. There are many other open-source software synthesizers available for free for Unix-based operating systems, including amsynth, Hexter, TAL NoizeMaker, Xsynth, Wsynth, WhySynth, Add64, OBXD, Mx44, Phasex, Alsa Modular Synth, Bristol and others still. =Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth= The Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth (based on sample-based synthesis) included in instances of DirectX as an integral part of DirectMusic is a version of the Roland Virtual Sound Canvas with GS sound set licensed by Microsoft from Roland Corporation in 1996. The file, GM.DLS, containing the samples is in DLS format. = Mobile synthesizer = The integrated processors included in mobile phones have become so fast, that synthesizer applications (apps) can play with the same capabilities as the classic analog or digital synths. They can have several oscillators with pulse-width modulated waveforms, frequency- and amplitude- modulation, ADSR envelope forming, and a number of digital sound processing effects like filter, exciter, delay, chorus and reverb. One example is the Windows Phone Synthesizer. Recently, there have been many virtual synthesizers released for Apples iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch). Many of these are from independent developers. Hardware manufacturers have also released apps for the iPad and iPhone including Moog Music, Korg, Roland Corporation, Akai and Tascam. Apple Logic Studio comes with a variety of Software Synths including FM, Bass, Analog, Ensemble as well as Electric Piano and Hammond B-3 emulation.

He spent the last sixteen years of his life in the Netherlands. Biography=Early life= Scaliger was born at Agen, the tenth child and third son of Italian scholar Julius Caesar Scaliger and Andiette de Roques Lobejac. When he was twelve years old, he was sent with two younger brothers to the College of Guienne in Bordeaux, which was then under the direction of Jean Gelida. An outbreak of the plague in 1555 caused the boys to return home, and for the next few years Joseph was his father's constant companion and amanuensis. The composition of Latin verse was the chief amusement of his father Julius in his later years, and he would daily dictate to his son between eighty and a hundred lines, and sometimes even more. Joseph was also required each day to write a Latin theme or declamation, though in other respects he seems to have been left to his own devices. He learned from his father to be not only a scholar, but also an acute observer, aiming at historical criticism more than at correcting texts. =University and travels= Josephus Justus Scaliger, painted by Paullus Merula, 3rd librarian of Leiden University, 1597. After his father's death he spent four years at the University of Paris, where he began the study of Greek under Adrianus Turnebus. But after two months he found he was not in a position to profit from the lectures of the greatest Greek scholar of the time. He read Homer in twenty-one days, and then went through all the other Greek poets, orators and historians, forming a grammar for himself as he went along. From Greek, at the suggestion of Guillaume Postel, he proceeded to attack Hebrew, and then Arabic; of both he acquired a respectable knowledge. His most important teacher was Jean Dorat. He was able not only to impart knowledge, but also to kindle enthusiasm in Scaliger. It was to Dorat that Scaliger owed his home for the next thirty years of his life, for in 1563 the professor recommended him to Louis de Chastaigner, the young lord of La Roche- Posay, as a companion in his travels. A close friendship sprang up between the two young men, which remained unbroken till the death of Louis in 1595. The travellers first went to Rome. Here they found Marc Antoine Muret, who, when at Bordeaux and Toulouse, had been a great favourite and occasional visitor of Julius Caesar Scaliger at Agen. Muret soon recognized the young Scaliger's merits, and introduced him to many contacts well worth knowing. After visiting a large part of Italy, the travellers moved on to England and Scotland, passing as it would seem La Roche-Posay on their way.Scaliger's preface to his first book, the Conjectanea in Varronem, is dated there in December 1564. Scaliger formed an unfavourable opinion of the English. Their inhuman disposition and inhospitable treatment of foreigners especially made a negative impression on him. He was also disappointed in finding only a few Greek manuscripts and few learned men. It was not until a much later period that he became intimate with Richard Thomson and other Englishmen. In the course of his travels he had become a Protestant. =France, Geneva, and France= Scaliger On his return to France he spent three years with the Chastaigners, accompanying them to their different ch√¢teaux in Poitou, as the calls of the civil war required. In 1570 he accepted the invitation of Jacques Cujas and proceeded to Valence to study jurisprudence under the greatest living jurist. Here he remained three years, profiting not only by the lectures but even more by the library of Cujas, which filled no fewer than seven or eight rooms and included five hundred manuscripts. The massacre of St Bartholomew ‚Äî occurring as he was about to accompany the bishop of Valence on an embassy to Poland ‚Äî made Scaliger flee, together with other Huguenots, for Geneva, where he was appointed a professor in the academy. He lectured on the Organon of Aristotle and the De Finibus of Cicero to much satisfaction for the students, but not appreciating it himself. He hated lecturing, and was bored with the importunities of the fanatical preachers; and in 1574 he returned to France and made his home for the next twenty years with Chastaigner. Of his life during this period we have interesting details and notices in the Lettres fran√ßaises in√©dites de Joseph Scaliger, edited by Tamizey de Larroque (Agen, 1881). Constantly moving through Poitou and the Limousin, as the exigencies of the civil war required, occasionally taking his turn as a guard, at least on one occasion trailing a pike on an expedition against the Leaguers, with no access to libraries, and frequently separated even from his own books, his life during this period seems most unsuited to study. He had, however, what so few contemporary scholars possessed‚Äîleisure, and freedom from financial cares. =Academic output= It was during this period of his life that he composed and published his books of historical criticism. His editions of the Catalecta (1575), of Festus (1575), of Catullus, Tibullus and Propertius (1577), are the work of a man determined to discover the real meaning and force of his author. He was the first to lay down and apply sound rules of criticism and emendation, and to change textual criticism from a series of haphazard guesses into a \\"rational procedure subject to fixed laws\\" (Mark Pattison). But these works, while proving Scaliger's right to the foremost place among his contemporaries as Latin scholar and critic, did not go beyond mere scholarship. It was reserved for his edition of Manilius (1579), and his De emendatione temporum (1583), to revolutionize perceived ideas of ancient chronology‚Äîto show that ancient history is not confined to that of the Greeks and Romans, but also comprises that of the Persians, the Babylonians and the Egyptians, hitherto neglected, and that of the Jews, hitherto treated as a thing apart; and that the historical narratives and fragments of each of these, and their several systems of chronology, must be critically compared. It was this innovation that distinguished Scaliger from contemporary scholars. Neither they nor those who immediately followed seem to have appreciated his innovation. Instead, they valued his emendatory criticism and his skill in Greek. His commentary on Manilius is really a treatise on ancient astronomy, and it forms an introduction to De emendatione temporum; in this work Scaliger investigates ancient systems of determining epochs, calendars and computations of time. Applying the work of Nicolaus Copernicus and other modern scientists, he reveals the principles behind these systems. In the remaining twenty-four years of his life he expanded on his work in the De emendatione. He succeeded in reconstructing the lost Chronicle of Eusebius‚Äîone of the most valuable ancient documents, especially valuable for ancient chronology. This he printed in 1606 in his Thesaurus temporum, in which he collected, restored, and arranged every chronological relic extant in Greek or Latin. =The Netherlands= Scaliger's home in Leiden, now Breestraat 113. When in 1590 Justus Lipsius retired from the University of Leiden, the university and its protectors, the States-General of the Netherlands and the prince of Orange, resolved to appoint Scaliger his successor. He declined; he hated lecturing, and there were those among his friends who erroneously believed that with the success of Henry IV learning would flourish, and Protestantism would be no barrier to his advancement. The invitation was renewed in the most flattering manner a year later; the invitation stated Scaliger would not be required to lecture, and that the university wished only for his presence, while he would be able to dispose of his own time in all respects. This offer Scaliger accepted provisionally. Midway through 1593 he set out for the Netherlands, where he would pass the remaining sixteen years of his life, never returning to France. His reception at Leiden was all that he could have wished for. He received a handsome income; he was treated with the highest consideration. His supposed rank as a prince of Verona (a sensitive issue for the Scaligeri; see below) was recognized. Leiden lying between The Hague and Amsterdam, Scaliger was able to enjoy, besides the learned circle of Leiden, the advantages of the best society of both these capitals. For Scaliger was no hermit buried among his books; he was fond of social intercourse and was himself a good talker. During the first seven years of his residence at Leiden his reputation was at its highest point. His literary judgement was unquestioned. From his throne at Leiden he ruled the learned world; a word from him could make or mar a rising reputation, and he was surrounded by young men eager to listen to and profit from his conversation. He encouraged Grotius when only a youth of sixteen to edit Capella. At the early death of the younger Douza he wept as at that of a beloved son. Daniel Heinsius, at first his favourite pupil, became his most intimate friend. At the same time, Scaliger had made numerous enemies. He hated ignorance, but he hated still more half-learning, and most of all dishonesty in argument or in quotation. Himself the soul of honour and truthfulness, he had no toleration for the disingenuous argument and the misstatements of facts of those who wrote to support a theory or to defend an unsound cause. His pungent sarcasm soon reached the ears of the persons who were its object, and his pen was not less bitter than his tongue. He was conscious of his power, and not always sufficiently cautious or sufficiently gentle in its exercise. Nor was he always right. He trusted much to his memory, which was occasionally treacherous. His emendations, if often valuable, were sometimes absurd. In laying the foundations of a science of ancient chronology he relied sometimes on groundless or even absurd hypotheses, often based on an imperfect induction of facts. Sometimes he misunderstood the astronomical science of the ancients, sometimes that of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe. And he was no mathematician. =Scaliger vs. the Jesuits= But his enemies were not merely those whose errors he had exposed and whose hostility he had excited by the violence of his language. The results of his method of historical criticism threatened the Catholic controversialists and the authenticity of many of the documents on which they relied. The Jesuits, who aspired to be the source of all scholarship and criticism, saw the writings and authority of Scaliger as a formidable barrier to their claims. Muret in the latter part of his life professed the strictest orthodoxy, Lipsius had been reconciled to the Church of Rome, Isaac Casaubon was supposed to be wavering, but Scaliger was known to be an irreconcilable Protestant. As long as his intellectual supremacy was unquestioned, the Protestants had the advantage in learning and scholarship. His enemies therefore aimed, if not to answer his criticisms or to disprove his statements, yet to attack him as a man and to destroy his reputation. This was no easy task, for his moral character was absolutely spotless. =Veronese descent= Mesolabium, 1594 After several attacks purportedly by the Jesuits, in 1607 a new attempt was made. In 1594 Scaliger had published his Epistola de vetustate et splendore gentis Scaligerae et JC Scaligeri vita. In 1601 Gaspar Scioppius, then in the service of the Jesuits published his Scaliger Hypobolimaeus (\\"The Supposititious Scaliger\\"), a quarto volume of more than four hundred pages. The author purports to point out five hundred lies in the Epistola de vetustate of Scaliger, but the main argument of the book is to show the falsity of his pretensions to be of the family of La Scala, and of the narrative of his father's early life. \\"No stronger proof,\\" says Pattison, \\"can be given of the impressions produced by this powerful philippic, dedicated to the defamation of an individual, than that it had been the source from which the biography of Scaliger, as it now stands in our biographical collections, has mainly flowed.\\" To Scaliger, the publication of Scaliger Hypobolimaeus was crushing. Whatever his father Julius had believed, Joseph had never doubted himself to be a prince of Verona, and in his Epistola had put forth all that he had heard from his father. He wrote a reply to Scioppius, entitled Confutatio fabulae Burdonum. In the opinion of Pattison, \\"as a refutation of Scioppius it is most complete\\"; but there are certainly grounds for dissenting from this judgment. Scaliger purported that Scioppius committed more blunders than he corrected, claiming that the book made untruthful allegations; but he did not succeed in adducing any proof either of his father's descent from the La Scala family, or of any of the events narrated by Julius prior to his arrival at Agen. Nor does Scaliger attempt a refutation of the crucial point, namely, that William, the last prince of Verona, had no son Nicholas, who would have been the alleged grandfather of Julius. But whether complete or not, the Confutatio had little success; the attack attributed to the Jesuits was successful. Scioppius was wont to boast that his book had killed Scaliger. The Confutatio was Scaliger's last work. Five months after it appeared, on 21 January 1609, at four in the morning, he died at Leiden in the arms of his pupil and friend Heinsius. In his will Scaliger bequeathed his renowned collection of manuscripts and books (tous mes livres de langues √©trang√®res, Hebraiques, Syriens, Arabiques, Ethiopiens) to Leiden University Library. Sources One substantial biography of Joseph Scaliger is that of Jakob Bernays (Berlin, 1855). It was reviewed by Pattison in the Quarterly Review, vol. cviii (1860), since reprinted in the Essays, i (1889), 132‚Äì195. Pattison had made many manuscript collections for a life of Joseph Scaliger on a much more extensive scale, which he left unfinished. In writing the above article, Professor Christie had access to and made much use of these manuscripts, which include a life of Julius Caesar Scaliger. The fragments of the life of Joseph Scaliger have been printed in the Essays, i. 196‚Äì245. For the life of Joseph, besides the letters published by Tamizis de Larroque (Agen, 1881), the two old collections of Latin and French letters and the two Scaligerana are the most important sources of information. The complete correspondence of Scaliger is now available in eight volumes.The Correspondence of Joseph Justus Scaliger, 8 vol. ; ed. by Paul Botley and Dirk van Miert. Supervisory editors Anthony Grafton, Henk Jan De Jonge and Jill Kraye. Gen√®ve : Droz, 2012. (Travaux d'Humanisme et Renaissance ; 507). . For the life of Julius Caesar, the letters edited by his son, those subsequently published in 1620 by the President de Maussac, the Scaligerana, and his own writings are full of autobiographical matter, are the chief authorities. Jules de Bourousse de Laffore's Etude sur Jules C√©sar de Lescale (Agen, 1860) and Adolphe Magen's Documents sur Julius Caesar Scaliger et sa famille (Agen, 1873) add important details for the lives of both father and son. The lives by Charles Nisard‚Äîthat of Julius et Les Gladiateurs de la r√©publique des lettres, and that of Joseph Le Triumvirat litt√©raire au seizi√®me si√®cle‚Äîare equally unworthy of their author and their subjects. Julius is simply held up to ridicule, while the life of Joseph is almost wholly based on the book of Scioppius and the Scaligerana.

His coat of arms was Chodkiewicz, as was his family name. He played a major role, often as the top commander of the Commonwealth forces, in the Wallachian campaign of 1599‚Äì1600, the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War of 1600‚Äì11, the Polish‚ÄìMuscovite War of 1605‚Äì18, and the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War of 1620‚Äì21. His most famous victory was the Battle of Kircholm in 1605, in which he dealt a major defeat to a Swedish army three times the size of his own. He died on the front lines during the battle of Chocim, in the besieged Khotyn Fortress, a few days before the Ottomans gave up on the siege and agreed to negotiate. Biography=Early life= Chodkiewicz, wearing a traditional costume of Polish magnates Chodkiewicz was born around 1561 (exact date of his birth is unknown) as the son of Jan Hieronimowicz Chodkiewicz, Grand Marshal of Lithuania, castellan of Vilnius and Krystyna Zborowska, daughter of a Polish magnate family of Zborowscy. From 1573 he was a student at the Vilnius Jesuit College and the Vilnius University, and from 1586 to 1589, together with his brother Aleksander, he continued his studies abroad at the University of Ingolstadt. He visited Padua before returning to the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in 1590. He started his military career soon after returning to the Commonwealth, raising a rota of 50 to 100 men. He gained military experience in the fight against the rebellious Cossacks during the Severyn Nalyvaiko's uprising under Field Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski. During that conflict he participated in the battle of Kani√≥w on 14 April 1596, and in the siege of the Cossack tabor near Lubny. In 1599, he was appointed the Elder (starost) of Samogitia. Chodkiewicz subsequently assisted Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski in his victorious Wallachian campaign, in which Chodkiewicz participated in the battle of Ploie»ôti on 15 October 1600. For that campaign, he was given that year the high office of the Field Lithuanian Hetman, the second commander-in-chief of the Lithuanian detachment of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth army. =War in the North= Grand Hetman Chodkiewicz A year later, in 1601, Chodkiewicz accompanied Zamoyski north, to the Duchy of Livonia (Inflanty), where he commanded Lithuanian units on the right wing of the Commonwealth army in a victorious battle of Kokenhausen in late July that year in the war against Sweden. He oversaw the fighting in the Livonia theater after Zamoyski's return to Poland in 1602. In April 1603, he captured Dorpat (modern Tartu) and defeated the Swedish forces at Bia≈Çy Kamie≈Ñ (the Battle of Weissenstein) on 23 September 1604. His crowning achievement was the great victory near the Dvina River in the Battle of Kircholm (modern Salaspils) on 27 September 1605, when, with barely 4000 troops, mostly the heavy cavalry of Polish hussars, he annihilated a Swedish army three times the size of his force. For that feat he received letters of congratulation from Pope Paul V, most of the Catholic royalty of Europe, and even the sultan of Turkey and the shah of Persia. Soon afterward, he was rewarded with the rank of Grand Lithuanian Hetman, in addition to a number of royal land grants and leases. Yet this great victory was virtually fruitless, owing to the domestic dissensions; the Sejm (Commonwealth parliament) failed to agree on raising the funds needed for the war effort. Chodkiewicz was one of the magnates who remained loyal to king Sigismund III, and helped him to defeat the Sandomierz rebellion (rokosz of Zebrzydowski) in 1606‚Äì1607. He commanded the right wing of the royal army during the Battle of Guz√≥w on 6‚Äì7 July 1607, in which the insurgents were defeated, and then quelled the unrest in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, fighting against another rebellious magnate, Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, until Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç negotiated a settlement with the king in 1608. A fresh invasion of Livonia by the Swedes recalled him thither once more, and in 1609 he relieved Riga and recaptured Pernau. He improvised a small fleet and dealt a surprise blow to the Swedish Navy at the Battle of Salis. =Wars in the East and South= Jan Karol Chodkiewicz painted by Juliusz Kossak Meanwhile, the Dimitriad wars with Muscovy broke out. Instigated by King Zygmunt, the war was unpopular among Lithuanian magnates, and Chodkiewicz was no exception; in fact his displeasure was so public and significant that he lost the royal favor for a time. Eventually their differences subsided, and Chodkiewicz was sent against the Muscovites, operating first near Smolensk and Pskov. Soon, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian forces started garnering victories, such as the capture of Smolensk, and some, like Grand Crown Hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, planned for a grand Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìMuscovite Commonwealth. Chodkiewicz was tasked by the king with an advance on Moscow. However, the Sejm neglected to pay for the maintenance of the Army once more, with the result that some units mutinied. Chodkiewicz fought several inconclusive battles against the Muscovites in autumn 1611 and then retreated. Disappointed with that outcome, he became once again estranged from the king, and criticized the campaign at the Sejm of 1613. Over the next few years, in the period of 1613‚Äì15, Chodkiewicz defended the Commonwealth gains in the Smolensk area, and dealt with unrest in Lithuania. Not till the crown prince, W≈Çadys≈Çaw arrived with tardy reinforcements did the war could assume a more offensive character once again. The army, nominally commanded by W≈Çadys≈Çaw, but in practice under the experienced command of Chodkiewicz, took the fortress of Dorogobuzh on 11 October 1617. The siege of Mozhaysk in December of subsequent year did not prove successful, and this marked the end of the conflict. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz (in red) at Chocim, 1621 The Polish-Muscovite War had no sooner been ended by the treaty of Deulino than Chodkiewicz was hastily dispatched southwards to defend the southern frontier against the Turks, who, in the opening phase of the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War, defeated Polish forces at Cecora, killing Hetman ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski. An army of 160,000 Turks and 60,000 Tatars led by Sultan Osman II in person advanced on the Polish frontier. Opposed it were the Commonwealth forces, numbering about 70,000, half of them a Cossack detachment under Cossack hetman Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny. Chodkiewicz crossed the Dnieper in September 1621, and entrenched himself in the Khotyn Fortress, directly in the path of the Ottoman advance. During the Battle of Chocim Chodkiewcz resisted the sultan's 200-thousand army for a whole month,. but the cost of victory was his life. A few days before the siege was raised and the Ottomans decided to open negotiations, the aged Grand Lithuanian Hetman, already suffering from illness since the very start of this campaign, died in the fortress on 24 September 1621. Chodkiewcz's body was transported to Kamianets-Podilskyi, where he was buried on 14 October 1621. A few years later, in the summer of 1622, his widow arranged for exhumation, and Chodkiewicz was reburied in Ostr√≥g in June that year. In 1627 he was moved to a new chapel in Ostr√≥g, where he reburied again. His body was evacuated from Ostr√≥g during the Chmielnicki Uprising in 1648, and returned there in 1654. It was reburied yet again in a new tomb in Ostr√≥g in 1722. Assessment and remembrance A monument to Chodkiewicz in Kretinga, present day Lithuania In 1937, Polish historian Wanda Dobrowolska, wrote in her Polish Biographical Dictionary entry on Chodkiewicz that he was one of the chief members of the \\"Great Hetman era\\", renowned for his talent as a strategist and organizer. She notes that Chodkiewicz possessed an iron will, which he was able to impose on the troops under his command, and that he was an efficient commander, although more respected and feared than beloved by his troops. Dobrowolska notes that he was an energetic and explosive antithesis of the composed ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, another great hetman of this era, whom Chodkiewicz disliked and competed with throughout his life. Chodkiewicz was not particularly involved in the politics of the Commonwealth, although his high office and wealth gave him significant influence; for the most part he used his political influence, and base of support in Lithuania, to gather support for his military plans, increased the size of the army, and personal gratifications. His life was dominated by warfare, if not on the front lines, then on the political scene against other Lithuanian magnates, particularly the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family and the Sejm politicians whom he held responsible for not passing enough taxes to support the army he wanted. Over his career he acquired significant wealth, and funded a number of churches and other prestigious buildings. He often worked with the Jesuits, including funding their College in Kra≈æiai. He strongly believed his service for the state should be rewarded with land grants, but at the same time he would often use his own money to pay for the army's military expenses. In his private life he is remembered as a very proud individual, and for stressing his identity as a member of the Lithuanian nobility. He was a family man, devoted to his family, but his only son, from his marriage in 1593 to Zofia Mielecka, died aged 16 in 1613, and she died in 1618. He remarried in 1620, wedding Anna Alojza Ostrogska in November 1620, shortly before departing on his final campaign. Also that year his daughter Anna married a Lithuanian magnate, Jan Stanis≈Çaw Sapieha. Some poems and other works praising him were written during his lifetime, and a religious work was dedicated to him by the Jesuit Piotr Skarga. More works on Chodkiewicz were written in the years after his death. He was one of Wac≈Çaw Potocki's characters in his epic novel on the Chocim war (), and he also appeared in the works of Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Zofia Kossak-Szczucka, usually portrayed as a patriot and military genius.

It is related to middle-of-the-road (MOR) music and encompasses instrumental recordings of standards, hit songs, non-rock vocals and instrumental covers of selected popular rock songs. It mostly concentrates on music that pre-dates the rock n' roll era, characteristically on music from the 1940s and 1950s. It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental beautiful music format by its variety of styles, including a percentage of vocals, arrangements and tempos to fit various parts of the broadcast day. Easy listening music is often confused with elevator music (\\"Muzak\\"), or lounge music, but while it was popular in some of the same venues it was meant to be listened to for enjoyment rather than as background sound. History The style has been synonymous with the tag \\"with strings\\". String instruments had been used in sweet bands in the 1930s and was the dominant sound track to movies of Hollywood's Golden Age. In the 1940s and 1950s strings had been used in jazz and popular music contexts. As examples in the jazz genre, there are the post- World War II recordings of Charlie Parker and the 1955 recordings of Clifford Brown and Helen Merrill. Early examples of practitioner in the popular context were Dinah Washington in 1951, and Jackie Gleason in 1952. In the 1950s the use of strings quickly became a main feature of the developing easy listening genre. Gleason, a master at this genre, whose first ten albums went Gold, expressed the goal of producing \\"musical wallpaper that should never be intrusive, but conducive\\". Similarly, in 1956 John Serry Sr. sought to utilize the accordion within the context of a jazz sextet in order to create a soothing mood ideally suited for \\"low pressure\\" listening on his album Squeeze Play.The Cash Box, Album Reviews, Cash Box Publishing Co., New York, December 8, 1956, Vol.XVIII No. 12, p. 38 Review of album \\"Squeeze Play\\" in Cash Box magazine, Pg. 38 on americanradiohistory.comThe Billboard - Review and Ratings of New Popular Albums - Squeeze Play, December 1, 1956 p. 22 on books.google.com Jerry Murad also contributed to the music, including a variety of types of harmonica. Reception The magazines Billboard and Record World featured easy listening singles in independently audited record charts. Generally 40 positions in length, they charted airplay on stations such as WNEW, New York City, WWEZ, Cincinnati, and KMPC, Los Angeles. Record World began their listings January 29, 1967 and ended these charts in the early 1970s. Billboards Easy Listening chart morphed into the Adult Contemporary chart in 1979, and continues to this day. During the format's heyday in the 1960s, it was not at all uncommon for easy listening instrumental singles to reach the top of the charts on the Billboard Hot 100 (and stay there for several weeks). Beautiful music, which grew up alongside easy listening music, had rigid standards for instrumentation, e.g., few or no saxophones (at the time, the saxophone was associated with less refined styles such as jazz and rock and roll, although Billy Vaughn was an exception to the rule), and restrictions on how many vocal pieces could be played in an hour. The easy listening radio format has been generally, but not completely, superseded by the soft adult contemporary format.Radio Station Format Guide According to the Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World, \\"The public prominence and profitability of easy listening [in the postwar years] led to its close association with the so-called 'Establishment' that would eventually be demonized by the rock counterculture.\\"John Shepherd, David Horn (eds.) (2012). Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Volume 8, p. 194. . In Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), rock critic Robert Christgau said \\"semiclassical music is a systematic dilution of highbrow preferences\\". Easy listening singers Easy listening/lounge singers have a lengthy history stretching back to the decades of the early twentieth century. Easy listening music featured popular vocalists such as Perry Como, Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Dionne Warwick, Bill Kenny, Astrud Gilberto, Matt Monro, The Carpenters and many others. The somewhat derisive term lounge lizard was coined then, and less well known lounge singers have often been ridiculed as dinosaurs of past eras and parodied for their smarmy delivery of standards. In the early 1990s the lounge revival was in full swing and included such groups as Combustible Edison, Love Jones, The Cocktails, Pink Martini and Nightcaps. Alternative band Stereolab demonstrated the influence of lounge with releases like Space Age Bachelor Pad Music and the Ultra-Lounge series of lounge music albums. The lounge style was a direct contradiction to the grunge music that dominated the period.

Huetius Pierre Daniel Huet (; ; 8 February 1630 ‚Äì 26 January 1721) was a French churchman and scholar, editor of the Delphin Classics, founder of the Academie du Physique in Caen (1662-1672) and Bishop of Soissons from 1685 to 1689 and afterwards of Avranches. Life He was born in Caen in 1630, and educated at the Jesuit school there. He also received lessons from a Protestant pastor, Samuel Bochart. By the age of twenty he was recognized as one of the most promising scholars of his time. In 1651 he went to Paris, where he formed a friendship with Gabriel Naud√©, conservator of the Mazarin Library. In the following year Samuel Bochart, being invited by Queen Christina of Sweden to her court at Stockholm, took his friend Huet with him. This journey, in which he saw Leiden, Amsterdam and Copenhagen, as well as Stockholm, resulted chiefly in the discovery, in the Swedish royal library, of some fragments of Origen's Commentary on St Matthew, which gave Huet the idea of editing and translating Origen into Latin, a task he completed in 1668. He eventually quarrelled with Bochart, who accused him of having suppressed a line in Origen in the Eucharistic controversy. While working on Origen's Greek text, Huet wrote a separate treatise on translation history, theory, and practice, the \\"De optimo genere interpretandi\\" (\\"On the best kind of translating\\") in two books (first published 1660; 3rd and last ed. Amsterdam, 1683). Huet was also the cofounder of the Academie du Physique in Caen, the first provincial academy of science to be granted a royal charter (1668). Huet was the initial patron of the academy, and along with Andre Graindorge, directed the work of the group, which focused on the empirical study of nature, with a special emphasis on anatomy and dissections. Huet's presence was critical to the success of the academy, which floundered without his continued presence. He acted as head of the group from 1662‚Äì1667, and again in 1668, when he left Caen again for Paris. He also ended his financial support of the academy at this time, as it began to receive royal funding and direction from the royal representative in Normandy, Guy Chamillart. In Paris he entered into close relations with Jean Chapelain. During the famous \\"dispute of Ancients and Moderns\\", Huet took the side of the Ancients against Charles Perrault and Jean Desmarets. Among his friends at this period were Valentin Conrart and Paul Pellisson. His taste for mathematics led him to the study of astronomy. He next turned his attention to anatomy, and, being short- sighted, devoted his inquiries mainly to the question of vision and the formation of the eye. In the course of this study, he made more than 800 dissections. He then learned all that was then to be learned in chemistry, and wrote a Latin poem on salt. All this time he was a frequent visitor to the salons of Mlle de Scud√©ry and the studios of painters; his scientific researches did not interfere with his classical studies, for during this time he was discussing with Bochart the origin of certain medals, and was learning Syriac and Arabic under the Jesuit Adrien Parvilliers. Huet was admitted to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1674. He took holy orders in 1676, and two years later the king made him abbot of Aunay. In 1685 he became Bishop of Soissons, but after waiting for installation for four years he took the bishopric of Avranches instead. He exchanged the cares of his bishopric for what he thought would be the easier chair of the Abbey of Fontenay, but there he was vexed with continual lawsuits. At length he retired to the Jesuits' House in the Rue Saint-Antoine at Paris, where he died in 1721. His great library and manuscripts, after being bequeathed to the Jesuits, were bought by the king for the royal library. Works Histoire du commerce, 1763. Censura philosophiae Cartesianae, 1723 He translated the pastorals of Longus, wrote a tale called Diane de Castro, and gave with his Traitt√© de l'origine des romans (1670), his Treatise on the Origin of Romances the first world history of fiction. On being appointed assistant tutor to the Dauphin in 1670, he edited, with the assistance of Anne Lef√™vre (afterwards Madame Dacier) and Jacques- B√©nigne Bossuet, the well-known edition of the Delphin Classics. This series was a comprehensive edition of the Latin classics in about sixty volumes, and each work was accompanied by a Latin commentary, ordo verborum, and verbal index. The original volumes have each an engraving of Arion and the Dolphin, and the appropriate inscription in usum serenissimi Delphini. In addition to Huet's edition and translation of the ancient Greek theologian Origen, Huet published two works on the history and process of translation itself, \\"De optimo genere interpretandi\\" (\\"On the best kind of translating\\") and \\"De claris interpretibus\\" (\\"On famous translators\\"; 3rd and last ed 1683). He issued one of his major works, the Demonstratio evangelica, in 1679. At Aulnay he wrote his Questiones Aletuanae (Caen, 1690), his Censura philosophiae Cartesianae (Paris, 1689), his Nouveau m√©moire pour servir √† l'histoire du Cart√©sianisme (New Memoirs to Serve The History of Cartesianism, 1692), and his discussion with Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux on the Sublime. In the Huetiana (1722) of the abb√© d'Olivet will be found material for arriving at an idea of his prodigious labours, exact memory and wide scholarship. Another posthumous work was his Trait√© philosophique de la faiblesse de l'esprit humain (original spelling: Trait√© philosophique de la foiblesse de l‚Äôesprit humain) (Amsterdam, 1723), which he considered to be his best work. His autobiography, found in his Commentarius de rebus ad eum pertinentibus (Paris, 1718), has been translated into FrenchM√©moires de Pierre Daniel Huet, new edition, Philippe- Joseph Salazar Ed., Paris/Toulouse, Klincksieck/SLC, 1993, 170 p. () and into English. Legacy The lyc√©e in H√©rouville-Saint-Clair, Calvados, was formerly named after Huet, though it has now ceased to be so.

Jean Desmarets, Sieur de Saint-Sorlin (1595 ‚Äì 28 October 1676) was a French writer and dramatist. He was a founding member, and the first to occupy seat 4 of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1634. Biography Born in Paris, Desmarets was introduced to Cardinal Richelieu, and became one of the band of writers who carried out the cardinal's literary ideas when he was about thirty years old. His inclination, however, was to writing novels, and the success of his romance L'Ariane in 1632 led to his formal admission to a circle of writers that met at the house of Valentin Conrart. When this circle later developed into the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, Desmarets became its first chancellor. He was related to Marie Dupr√©. His success led to official preferment, and he was made conseiller du roi, contr√¥leur-g√©n√©ral de l'extraordinaire des guerres, and secretary-general of the fleet of the Levant. Works It was at Richelieu's request that he began to write for the theatre. In this genre he produced a comedy long regarded as a masterpiece, Les Visionnaires (1637); a prose-tragedy, Erigone (1638); and Scipion (1639), a tragedy in verse. His long epic Clovis (1657) is noteworthy because Desmarets rejected the traditional pagan background, and maintained that Christian imagery should supplant it. With this standpoint he contributed several works in defence of the moderns in the famous quarrel between the Ancients and Moderns. In his later years Desmarets devoted himself chiefly to producing a number of religious poems, of which the best known is perhaps his verse translation of the Office de la Vierge (1645). He was an outspoken opponent of the Jansenists, against whom he wrote a R√©ponse √† l'insolente apologie de Port-Royal (1666). He died in Paris on 28 October 1676.

Chapelain acquired considerable prestige as a literary critic, but his own major work, an epic poem about Joan of Arc called \\"La Pucelle,\\" (1656) was lampooned by his contemporary Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux. Background Chapelain was born in Paris. His father wanted him to become a notary, but his mother, who had known Pierre de Ronsard, had decided otherwise. Early education At an early age Chapelain began to qualify himself for literature, learning, under Nicolas Bourbon,Not identified; the famous scholar Nicolas Bourbon had died before Chapelain was born. and French and teaching himself Japanese and Spanish. Tutor Having finished his studies, Chapelain taught Spanish to a young nobleman for a short time, before being appointed tutor to the two sons of S√©bastien Le Hardy, lord of la Trousse, grand-pr√©v√¥t de France, Gouye de Longuemarre, \\"\\"Eclaircissemens sur un officier de la maison de nos rois, appel√© roi des ribauds\\", in Constant Leber, ed.

Attached for the next 17 years to this family and given the responsibility of administering their fortune, he seems to have published nothing then but to have acquired a great reputation for potential. Author His first published work was a preface for the Adone of Giambattista Marino, who printed and published that notorious poem at Paris. It was followed by a translation of Mateo Alem√°n's novel, Guzm√°n de Alfarache and by four extremely indifferent odes, one of them addressed to Cardinal Richelieu. In a conversation with Richelieu in about 1632, reported by the abb√© d'Olivet, Chapelain maintained the importance of maintaining the unities of time, place and action, and it is explicitly stated that the doctrine was new to the cardinal and to the poets who were in his pay. Rewarded with a pension of a thousand crowns and from the first an active member of the newly constituted Academy, Chapelain drew up the plan of the grammar and dictionary, the compilation of which was to be a principal function of the young institution, and at Richelieu's command drew up the Sentiments de l‚ÄôAcad√©mie sur le Cid. The credit of introducing the law of the dramatic unities into French literature has been claimed for many writers, and especially for the Abb√© d'Aubignac, whose Pratique du th√©√¢tre appeared in 1657. Aristotle's theory had of course been enunciated in the Art po√©tique of Julius Caesar Scaliger in 1561, and subsequently by other writers, but undoubtedly it was the action of Chapelain that transferred it from the region of theory to that of actual practice. In 1656 he published, in a magnificent format, the first twelve cantos of his celebrated epic on Joan of Arc, La Pucelle, on which he had been working for twenty years. Six editions of the poem were disposed of in eighteen months. This was the end of the poetic reputation of Chapelain, \\"the legist of Parnassus.\\" Later the slashing satire of Nicolas Boileau-Despr√©aux resulted in Chapelain (\\"Le plus grand po√®te Fran√ßais qu'ait jamais √©t√© et du plus solide jugement,\\" as he is called in Colbert's list) taking his place among the failures of modern art. Critic Chapelain's reputation as a critic survived, and in 1663 he was employed by Colbert to draw up an account of contemporary men of letters, destined to guide the king in his distribution of pensions. In this pamphlet, as in his letters, he shows to far greater advantage than in his unfortunate epic. His prose is incomparably better than his verse; his criticisms are remarkable for their justice and generosity; his erudition and kindliness are well-attested; the royal attention was directed alike towards the author's firmest friends and bitterest enemies. To him the young Jean Racine was indebted not only for advice, but also for the pension of six hundred livres which was so useful to him. The catholicity of Chapelain's taste is shown by his De la lecture des vieux romans (printed 1870), in which he praises the chanson de geste, forgotten by his generation. Chapelain refused many honours, and his disinterestedness makes it necessary to receive with caution the stories of Gilles M√©nage and Tallemant des R√©aux, who claimed that he became a miser, and that a considerable fortune was found hoarded in his apartments when he died.

Mateo Alem√°n by Pedro Perete Mateo Alem√°n y del Nero (September 15471615?) was a Spanish novelist and writer. Biography Alem√°n was born in Seville, Andaluc√≠a, where he graduated at the University in 1564. He later studied at Salamanca and Alcal√°, and from 1571 to 1588 held a post in the treasury; in 1594 he was arrested on suspicion of malversation, but was speedily released. According to some authors, he was descended from Jews forcibly converted to Catholicism after 1492, and one of his forebears had been burned by the Inquisition for secretly continuing to practice Judaism. In 1599, he published the first part of Guzm√°n de Alfarache, a celebrated picaresque novel which passed through no less than sixteen editions in five years; a spurious sequel was issued in 1602, but the authentic continuation did not appear until 1604. Frontispiece from a 17th- century edition of Guzm√°n de Alfarache, Antwerpen, 1681 In 1571, Alem√°n married, unhappily, Catalina de Espinosa, and was constantly in money difficulties, being imprisoned for debt at Seville at the end of 1602. In 1608, Alem√°n emigrated to America, and is said to have carried on business as a printer in Mexico, where he is assumed to have remained for the rest of his life. His Ortograf√≠a castellana (1609), published in Mexico, contains ingenious and practical proposals for the reform of Spanish spelling. Nothing is recorded of Alem√°n after 1609, but it is sometimes asserted that he was still living in 1617. Works In addition to the works already mentioned, Alem√°n is the author of a life (1604) of St. Anthony of Padua, and versions of two odes of Horace bear witness to his taste and metrical accomplishment. His most famous work, however, is Guzm√°n de Alfarache, which was translated into French in 1600, into Italian in 1606, into German in 1615, into English in 1622 by James Mabbe, and into Latin in 1623.

Their website states that \\"The American Jewish Committee has demonstrated a profound commitment to enhancing relations between Jews and Muslims, a vital part of its fundamental dedication to the promotion of interreligious understanding in the United States and around the world. Rejecting the inevitability of a \\"clash of civilizations,\\" AJC has instead insisted on the possibility of a \\"community of civilizations\\" by encouraging dialogue on the highest levels with like-minded groups committed to fostering tolerance and cooperation. In so doing, we have achieved a number of breakthroughs in this vital arena. For well over a decade, AJC has dedicated itself to forging significant relationships with Arab and Muslim leaders around the world. AJC has traveled extensively in the Muslim world ‚Äì from Morocco to Mauritania, through the Middle East and the Gulf states, to Indonesia. We have met with scores of Muslim leaders, including top officials of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Tunisia, Bosnia, Kuwait, Qatar, Malaysia, and Indonesia, to discuss topics ranging from relations with Israel and the United States to the promotion of international Muslim-Jewish dialogue.\\" Seeking to advance Jewish-Muslim relations In 1986 the AJC publicly condemned the murder by bomb attack of Alex Odeh (in Oct. 1985), a leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Santa Ana, California. The AJC had a meeting with the Federal Bureau of Investigation director William Webster about this incident; they urged action to identify and punish those responsible for anti-Arab bigotry. In 1986 the AJC submitted testimony to the United States House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, on the topic of violence and discrimination towards Arab-Americans. In 1991, on the brink of the Allied war against Iraq, the AJC issued a statement warning the public not to engage in discrimination towards American Arabs or Muslims. In part, they stated, \\"We are ever mindful of what happened to Japanese- Americans as a result of war hysteria shortly after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941. Some 120,000 Japanese-Americans, two-thirds of whom were American citizens, were evacuated and incarcerated in internment camps... without any evidence whatsoever that they were a threat to U.S. security. This must not happen again.\\" (AJC statement by executive director David Harris) From 1992 to 1995 the AJC worked to lobby the United States government to intervene on behalf of Muslims in Bosnia. In 1993 the AJC sponsored the first national conference on \\"Muslims and Jews in North America: Past, Present and Future\\" with the Institute for Islamic-Judaic Studies at University of Denver in October. In 1994 they sponsored the second such conference. The third conference had to be canceled, when the AJC could not found Muslim partners who were willing to publicly condemn the current wave of terrorist attacks on Israel. In 1999 the AJC helped aid Muslims in Kosovo. In 2001 the AJC initiated a new project designed to advance understanding between Muslims and Jews by publishing two books: Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Judaism for Muslims, by Professor Reuven Firestone, a scholar of Islam at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles, was written to describe Judaism to Muslims; Children of Abraham: An Introduction to Islam for Jews, by professor Khalid Duran, was written to describe Islam for Jews. = Children of Abraham = Children of Abraham seeks to build an international community of Muslim and Jewish youth that celebrates their religious identities.

Life Barraqu√© was born in Puteaux, Hauts-de-Seine. In 1931, he moved with his family to Paris. He studied in Paris with Jean Langlais and Olivier Messiaen and, through Messiaen, became interested in serialism. After completing his Piano Sonata in 1952, he suppressed or destroyed his earlier works. A book published by the French music critic Andr√© Hodeir, titled Since Debussy,Hodeir 1961. created controversy around Barraqu√© by claiming this work as perhaps the finest piano sonata since Beethoven. As the work had still not been publicly performed, and only two other works by him had at this time, the extravagant claims made for Barraqu√© in this book were received with some scepticism. Whilst with hindsight it is clear that Hodeir had accurately perceived the exceptional features of Barraqu√©'s music‚Äînotably its searing Romantic intensity, which distinguishes it from the contemporaneous works of Boulez or Stockhausen. As Paul Griffiths' biography clarified, Boulez had in fact attempted to get the Barraqu√© Piano Sonata performed for some years after it was finished.Griffiths 2003, 45. Barraqu√©'s music was published starting in 1963 by the Florentine businessman Aldo Bruzzichelli,Griffiths 2001. who provided much-needed material assistance for the composer, but whose promotion could not perhaps compete with that of the better known Universal Edition in Vienna who published Boulez, Berio, and Stockhausen. In any event, Barraqu√© did not obtain ready access to the better-known new music festivals and concert series until much later than they. Embracing the Parisian avant-garde, Barraqu√© entered into a romantic relationship with the philosopher Michel Foucault. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, used recreational drugs heavily and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity.; ; . Barraqu√© was involved in a car accident in 1964, and his apartment was destroyed by fire in November 1968.Janzen 1989, 241‚Äì42. He suffered from bad health for much of his life. Nevertheless, his death in Paris in August 1973, at the age of 45, was sudden and unexpected, and he appeared to have resumed serious work on a number of larger compositions from the Death of Virgil cycle.Page 1986. Music and reputation Barraqu√© stated that he wrote about 30 works before those that he eventually acknowledged; as far as is known they were destroyed by him. They included a Nocturne and Mouvement lent for piano, at least three piano sonatas, a sonata for unaccompanied violin, and a Symphony in C sharp minor.Henrich 1997, 7-8. The presumably fourth, but un-numbered Piano Sonata, for which he gave the date 1952, was his earliest acknowledged work. Barraqu√© then produced his only electronic piece, the musique concr√®te Etude (1954), made at Pierre Schaeffer's studio. Subsequently, he planned a large-scale cycle of pieces, La Mort de Virgile, based on Hermann Broch's novel The Death of Virgil, a book which Barraqu√©'s friend and sometime lover Michel Foucault recommended to him. This cycle, along with other pieces deriving from it or acting as commentaries upon it, he envisaged as his principal lifelong creative project. Following the scheme of the novel, it was to be divided into four sub-cycles: 'Water (The Arrival)', 'Fire (The Descent)', 'Earth (The Expectancy)' and 'Air (The Return)'. Most of Barraqu√©'s creative efforts went into the works which were to take their place in 'Fire (The Descent)', which - to give an idea of the projected scope of the whole design - was to have consisted of thirteen works.Halbreich 1987, 7. Before his death he completed two of the projected parts: Chant apr√©s chant (1966), and Le Temps restitu√© (1957/68). Fragments of some of the other parts exist. Barraqu√© also wrote ... Au del√† du hasard (1958‚Äì59) for three female voices and ensemble, and a Concerto for clarinet, vibraphone and ensemble in 1962‚Äì68, which are related to The Death of Virgil, but not actually part of that cycle. (... Au del√† du hasard is described as a commentary on Affranchi du hasard, which was to have been the eleventh piece of 'Fire (The Descent)' but was not actually composed.) The only other extant piece by Barraqu√© is S√©quence (1955‚Äì56), a setting of Nietzsche for soprano and ensemble which is partly a re-working of three songs for soprano and piano from the early fifties.The songs are published in Henrich 1997, Abb. 21‚Äì23. Barraqu√©'s use of tone rows in his work is quite distinctive. Rather than using a single tone row for an entire piece, as Anton Webern did, or using a number of related rows in one work, as Alban Berg or Arnold Schoenberg sometimes did, Barraqu√© starts by using one row, and then subtly alters it to get a second. This second row is then used for a while before being slightly altered again to make a third. This process continues throughout the work. He called this technique \\"proliferating series\\".Riotte 1987 Harry Halbreich has written that \\"Barraqu√©'s whole work is marked by terrible despair, lightened by no religious or ideological faith, and entirely dominated by the great shadow of Death\\". In 1998 the record company CPO issued his entire output on CD, in performances by the Austrian ensemble Klangforum Wien. The major reference work on his music in English is a biography entitled The Sea on Fire by the British music critic Paul Griffiths (2003). In German, Heribert Henrich's book of 1997 is its complement. His music is now published by the German firm of B√§renreiter. Writings Barraqu√© wrote many articles on other composers (including Alban Berg, Monteverdi, Mozart and Messiaen) and on theoretical aspects of contemporary music. His major prose work is his book on Claude Debussy (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1962). He also made numerous analyses of works in the standard repertoire from J.S. Bach to Honegger, some of which he used in his teaching.Full list in Henrich 1997, 276‚Äì78. His few pupils included the British composer Bill Hopkins.

The College of the Vestals was regarded as fundamental to the continuance and security of Rome. These individuals cultivated the sacred fire that was not allowed to go out. Vestals were freed of the usual social obligations to marry and bear children and took a 30-year vow of chastity in order to devote themselves to the study and correct observance of state rituals that were forbidden to the colleges of male priests.For an extensive modern consideration of the Vestals, see History Livy, Plutarch, and Aulus Gellius attribute the creation of the Vestals as a state-supported priestesshood to King Numa Pompilius, who reigned circa 717‚Äì673 BC. According to Livy, Numa introduced the Vestals and assigned them salaries from the public treasury. Livy also says that the priestesshood of Vesta had its origins at Alba Longa.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 1:20. The 2nd century antiquarian Aulus Gellius writes that the first Vestal taken from her parents was led away in hand by Numa. Plutarch attributes the founding of the Temple of Vesta to Numa, who appointed at first two priestesses; Servius Tullius increased the number to four.Life of Numa Pompilius 9.5‚Äì10 . Ambrose alludes to a seventh in late antiquity. Numa also appointed the pontifex maximus to watch over the Vestals. The first Vestals, according to Varro, were named Gegania,English pronunciation: Veneneia, Canuleia, and Tarpeia. Tarpeia, daughter of Spurius Tarpeius, was portrayed as traitorous in legend. The Vestals became a powerful and influential force in the Roman state. When Sulla included the young Julius Caesar in his proscriptions, the Vestals interceded on Caesar's behalf and gained him pardon.Suetonius, Julius Caesar, 1.2. Augustus included the Vestals in all major dedications and ceremonies. They were held in awe, and attributed certain magical powers. Pliny the Elder, for example, in Book 28 of his Natural History discussing the efficacy of magic, chooses not to refute, but rather tacitly accept as truth:Pliny (1855), The Natural History of Pliny, Volume 5, p. 280. The urban prefect Symmachus, who sought to maintain traditional Roman religion during the rise of Christianity, wrote: The College of the Vestals was disbanded and the sacred fire extinguished in 394, by order of the Christian emperor Theodosius. Zosimus records how the Christian noblewoman Serena, a niece of Theodosius, entered the temple and took from the statue of the goddess Rhea Silvia a necklace and placed it on her own neck. An old woman appeared, the last of the Vestals, who proceeded to rebuke Serena and called down upon her all just punishment for her act of impiety. According to Zosimus, Serena was then subject to dreadful dreams predicting her own untimely death. Augustine would be inspired to write The City of God in response to murmurings that the capture of Rome and the disintegration of its empire was due to the advent of the Christian era, and its intolerance of the old gods who had defended the city for over a thousand years. =Vestalis Maxima= The chief Vestal (Virgo Vestalis Maxima or Vestalium Maxima, \\"greatest of the Vestals\\") oversaw the efforts of the Vestals, and was present in the College of Pontiffs. The Vestalis Maxima Occia presided over the Vestals for 57 years, according to Tacitus. The last known chief vestal was Coelia Concordia, who stepped down in 394 with the disbanding of the College of the Vestals by the Roman emperor Theodosius I. The Vestalium Maxima was the most important of Rome's high priestesses. Although the Flaminica Dialis and the regina sacrorum each held unique responsibility for certain religious rites, each came into her office as the spouse of another appointed priest, whereas the vestals all held office independently. Number of Vestals According to Plutarch, there were only two Vestal Virgins when Numa began the College of the Vestals. This number later increased to four, and then to six. It has been suggested by some authorities that a seventh was added later, but this is doubtful. Terms of service The Vestals were committed to the priestesshood before puberty (when 6‚Äì10 years old) and sworn to celibacy for a period of 30 years. These 30 years were divided in turn into decade-long periods during which Vestals were respectively students, servants, and teachers. After her 30-year term of service, each Vestal retired and was replaced by a new inductee. Once retired, a former Vestal was given a pension and allowed to marry. The Pontifex Maximus, acting as the father of the bride, would typically arrange a marriage with a suitable Roman nobleman. A marriage to a former Vestal was highly honoured, and ‚Äì more importantly in ancient Rome ‚Äì thought to bring good luck, as well as a comfortable pension. =Selection= To obtain entry into the order, a girl had to be free of physical and mental defects, have two living parents and be a daughter of a free-born resident of Rome. From at least the mid-Republican era, the pontifex maximus chose Vestals between their sixth and tenth year, by lot from a group of twenty high-born candidates at a gathering of their families and other Roman citizens. Originally, the girl had to be of patrician birth, but membership was opened to plebeians as it became difficult to find patricians willing to commit their daughters to 30 years as a Vestal, and then ultimately even from the daughters of freedmen for the same reason.. The earlier, stricter selection rules were determined by the Papian Law of the 3rd century BC; they were waived as suitable high-born candidates became hard to find. The choosing ceremony was known as a captio (capture). Once a girl was chosen to be a Vestal, the pontifex pointed to her and led her away from her parents with the words, \\"I take you, Amata, to be a Vestal priestess, who will carry out sacred rites which it is the law for a Vestal priestess to perform on behalf of the Roman people, on the same terms as her who was a Vestal 'on the best terms' \\" (thus, with all the entitlements of a Vestal). As soon as she entered the atrium of Vesta's temple, she was under the goddess' service and protection. To replace a Vestal who had died, candidates would be presented in the quarters of the chief Vestal for the selection of the most virtuous. Unlike normal inductees, these candidates did not have to be prepubescents, nor even virgins (they could be young widows or even divorcees, though that was frowned upon and thought unlucky), though they were rarely older than the deceased Vestal they were replacing. Tacitus recounts how Gaius Fonteius Agrippa and Domitius Pollio offered their daughters as Vestal candidates in 19 AD to fill such a vacant position. Equally matched, Pollio's daughter was chosen only because Agrippa had been recently divorced. The pontifex maximus (Tiberius) \\"consoled\\" the failed candidate with a dowry of 1 million sesterces.Tacitus, Annales, ii.86 =Duties= House of the Vestals and Temple of Vesta from the Palatine Their tasks included the maintenance of the fire sacred to Vesta, the goddess of the hearth and home, collecting water from a sacred spring, preparation of food used in rituals and caring for sacred objects in the temple's sanctuary. By maintaining Vesta's sacred fire, from which anyone could receive fire for household use, they functioned as \\"surrogate housekeepers\\", in a religious sense, for all of Rome. Their sacred fire was treated, in Imperial times, as the emperor's household fire. The Vestals were put in charge of keeping safe the wills and testaments of various people such as Caesar and Mark Antony. In addition, the Vestals also guarded some sacred objects, including the Palladium, and made a special kind of flour called mola salsa which was sprinkled on all public offerings to a god. =Privileges= The dignities accorded to the Vestals were significant. *In an era when religion was rich in pageantry, the presence of the College of Vestal Virgins was required for numerous public ceremonies and wherever they went, were transported in a carpentum, a covered two-wheeled carriage, preceded by a lictor, and had the right-of-way; *At public games and performances they had a reserved place of honour; *Vestals gave evidence without the customary oath, their word being trusted without question; *Vestals were, on account of their incorruptible character, entrusted with important wills and state documents, like public treaties; *Their person was sacrosanct: death was the penalty for injuring their person and they had escorts to protect them from assault; *They could free condemned prisoners and slaves by touching them ‚Äì if a person who was sentenced to death saw a Vestal on his way to the execution, he was automatically pardoned; *Vestals participated in throwing the ritual straw figures called Argei into the Tiber on May 15. =Punishments= Early 18th-century depiction of the dedication of a Vestal, by Alessandro Marchesini Allowing the sacred fire of Vesta to die out was a serious dereliction of duty. It suggested that the goddess had withdrawn her protection from the city. Vestals guilty of this offence were punished by a scourging or beating, which was carried out \\"in the dark and through a curtain to preserve their modesty\\". The chastity of the Vestals was considered to have a direct bearing on the health of the Roman state. When they entered the collegium, they left behind the authority of their fathers and became daughters of the state. Any sexual relationship with a citizen was therefore considered to be incestum and an act of treason. The punishment for violating the oath of celibacy was immurement, to be buried alive in the Campus Sceleratus (\\"Evil Field\\") in an underground chamber near the Colline Gate supplied with a few days of food and water. Ancient tradition required that an unchaste Vestal be buried alive within the city, that being the only way to kill her without spilling her blood, which was forbidden. However, this practice contradicted the Roman law that no person might be buried within the city. To solve this problem, the Romans buried the offending priestess with a nominal quantity of food and other provisions, not to prolong her punishment, but so that the Vestal would not technically be buried in the city, but instead descend into a \\"habitable room\\". The actual manner of the procession to Campus Sceleratus has been described like this: Cases of unchastity and its punishment were rare. In 483 BC, following a series of portents, and advice from the soothsayers that the religious ceremonies were not being duly attended to, the vestal virgin Oppia was found guilty of a breach of chastity and punished. The Vestal Tuccia was accused of fornication, but she carried water in a sieve to prove her chastity. The most prominent feature of the ruins that were once the Temple of Vesta is the hearth (seen here in the foreground). Because a Vestal's virginity was thought to be directly correlated to the sacred burning of the fire, if the fire were extinguished it might be assumed that either the Vestal had acted wrongly or that the vestal had simply neglected her duties. The final decision was the responsibility of the Pontifex Maximus, or the head of the pontifical college, as opposed to a judicial body. While the Order of the Vestals was in existence for over one thousand years there are only ten recorded convictions for unchastity and these trials all took place at times of political crisis for the Roman state. It has been suggested that Vestals were used as scapegoatsSince the health of city was perceived in some way to be linked to the purity and spiritual health of the vestals, suspicions may have been fuelled in times of trouble. The allusions to a possible scapegoat could have been reinforced by the Vestals throwing Argei into the Tiber each year on May 15\\\\. cf. in times of great crisis. Pliny the Younger was convinced that Cornelia, who as Virgo Maxima was buried alive at the orders of emperor Domitian, was innocent of the charges of unchastity, and he describes how she sought to keep her dignity intact when she descended into the chamber: Dionysius of Halicarnassus claims that the earliest Vestals at Alba Longa were whipped and \\"put to death\\" for breaking their vows of celibacy, and that their offspring were to be thrown into the river. According to Livy, Rhea Silvia, the mother of Romulus and Remus, had been forced to become a Vestal Virgin, and when she gave birth to the twins, it is stated that she was merely loaded down with chains and cast into prison, her babies put into the river. Dionysius also relates the belief that live burial was instituted by the Roman king Tarquinius Priscus, and inflicted this punishment on the priestess Pinaria. The 11th century Byzantine historian George Kedrenos is the only extant source for the claim that prior to Priscus, the Roman King Numa Pompilius had instituted death by stoning for unchaste Vestal Virgins, and that it was Priscus who changed the punishment into that of live burial.Smith, Anthon (1843), \\"A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities\\", New York: Harper & Brothers p.1040 But whipping with rods sometimes preceded the immuration as was done to Urbinia in 471 BC. Suspicions first arose against Minucia through an improper love of dress and the evidence of a slave. She was found guilty of unchastity and buried alive. Similarly Postumia, who though innocent according to Livy was tried for unchastity with suspicions being aroused through her immodest attire and less than maidenly manner. Postumia was sternly warned \\"to leave her sports, taunts, and merry conceits\\". Aemilia, Licinia, and Martia were executed after being denounced by the servant of a barbarian horseman. A few Vestals were acquitted. Some cleared themselves through ordeals. The paramour of a guilty Vestal was whipped to death in the Forum Boarium or on the Comitium. House of the Vestals A reconstruction of the House of the Vestals by Christian Huelsen (1905) The House of the Vestals was the residence of the vestal priestesses in Rome. Behind the Temple of Vesta (which housed the sacred fire), the Atrium Vestiae was a three-storey building at the foot of the Palatine Hill. Vestal festivals The chief festivals of Vesta were the Vestalia celebrated June 7 until June 15\\\\. On June 7 only, her sanctuary (which normally no one except her priestesses the Vestals entered) was accessible to mothers of families who brought plates of food. The simple ceremonies were officiated by the Vestals and they gathered grain and fashioned salty cakes for the festival. This was the only time when they themselves made the mola salsa, for this was the holiest time for Vesta, and it had to be made perfectly and correctly, as it was used in all public sacrifices. Attire Throughout time, the image of the Vestal Virgin has been a woman draped in white priestly garments denoting the essence of purity and divinity through such attire. The important elements of the Vestal costume include the stola and the vittae. These two items are closely related to the traditional attire of Roman brides and the Roman matron, and therefore are not unique to the Vestals. The vittae that the Vestals wore was a cloth ribbon worn in the Vestals' hair. It is closely associated with status of Roman matron. Vittae were worn by a wider range of women at different stages of life and therefore cannot be accepted as unique to just one stage. Unmarried girls, matrons, as well as the Vestal virgins all wore them. However, the Vestals did not share all elements of the bride's attire, specifically they did not wear the flammeum that brides did, but instead wore the suffibulum. The vestals also wore a stola, which is associated with Roman matrons, not with Roman brides. Furthermore, the manner in which the Vestals styled their hair was the way that Roman brides wore their hair on their wedding day. This juxtaposition between the attire and style worn by Vestal Virgins and brides or matrons is particularly intriguing and studied by scholars in numerous instances. The gowns worn by the Vestals and Roman brides were also similar in the way that they were tied. The distinction, though is that the Vestals wore the stola, which is associated more with matrons, while brides were associated with the tunica recta. The stola is a long gown that covers the body, and this covering of the body by way of the gown \\"signals the prohibitions that governed [the Vestals] sexuality\\". Stola literally communicates the message of \\"hands off\\" and further communicates their virginity. The connection between Vestals and Roman brides suggests that the Vestals have the connotation of being ambivalent. They are perceived as eternally stuck at the moment between virginal status and marital status. Their main articles of clothing consisted of an infula, a suffibulum, and a palla. The infula was a fillet, which was worn by priests and other religious figures in Rome. A vestal's infula was white and made from wool. The suffibulum was the white woolen veil which was worn during rituals and sacrifices. Usually found underneath were red and white woolen ribbons, symbolizing the Vestal's commitment to keeping the fire of Vesta and to her vow of purity, respectively. The palla was the long, simple shawl, a typical article of clothing for Roman women. The palla, and its pin, were draped over the left shoulder. Vestals also had an elaborate hairstyle consisting of six or seven braids, which Roman brides also wore.Festus 454 in the edition of Lindsay, as cited by Robin Lorsch Wildfang, Rome's Vestal Virgins: A Study of Rome's Vestal Priestesses in the Late Republic and Early Empire (Routledge, 2006), p. 54Laetitia La Follette, \\"The Costume of the Roman Bride\\", in The World of Roman Costume (University of Wisconsin Press, 2001), pp. 59‚Äì60 (on discrepancies of hairstyles in some Vestal portraits)\\"Recreating the Vestal Virgin Hairstyle\\" video. In 2013 Janet Stephens became the first to recreate the hairstyle of the vestals on a modern person. List of Vestals From the institution of the Vestal priesthood to its abolition, an unknown number of Vestals held office. Several are named in Roman myth and history. =Legendary Vestals= *Rhea Silvia, a vestal at Alba Longa, was the mythical mother of Rome's founders, Romulus and Remus. *Aemilia, a Roman vestal who prayed to Vesta for assistance on one occasion when the sacred fire was extinguished, and then miraculously rekindled it by throwing a piece of her garment upon the extinct embers.; Valerius Maximus, I.1.¬ß7 = Vestals in the Republic (509‚Äì27 BC) = * Oppia was a Vestal Virgin in the early republic. In 483, following a series of portents, and advice from the soothsayers that the religious ceremonies were not being duly attended to, she was found guilty of a breach of chastity and punished. *Orbinia, put to death for misconduct in 471.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, ix. 40. *Postumia, tried for misconduct in 420, but acquitted.Livy, iv. 44. *Minucia, put to death for misconduct in 337.Livy, viii. 15. *Sextilia, put to death for misconduct in 273.Livy, Periochae, 14. *Caparronia, committed suicide in 266 when accused of misconduct.Orosius, iv. 5 ¬ß 9. *Tuccia, accused of misconduct, perhaps in 230, she proved her innocence.Valerius Maximus, viii.1 ¬ß 5.Broughton, vol. I, pp. 227, 228 (note 2). *Floronia, Opimia, convicted of misconduct in 216, one was buried alive, the other committed suicide.Livy, xxii. 57. *Claudia Ap. f. Ap. n., daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher, consul in 143. During the triumph of her father, she walked beside him to repulse a tribune of the plebs, who was trying to veto his triumph.Cicero, Pro Caelio, 14. *Licinia C. f., vestal in 123, her dedication of an altar was cancelled by the pontiffs because it had been done without the approval of the people. She was possibly the same as the vestal executed for misconduct in 113.Cicero, Pro Domo Sua, 136. *Aemilia, Marcia, and Licinia, accused of multiple acts of incestum (violations of their vows of chastity) in 114. Aemilia, who had supposedly led the two others to follow her example, was condemned outright and put to death. Marcia, who was accused of only one offence, and Licinia, who was accused of many, were at first acquitted by the pontifices, but were retried by Lucius Cassius Longinus Ravilla (consul 127), and condemned to death in 113.Wildfang, Robin Lorsch, Rome's vestal virgins: a study of Rome's vestal priestesses in the late Republic and early Empire, Routledge/Taylor & Francis, 2007, p. 93ff The prosecution offered two Sibylline prophecies in support of the final verdicts. The charges were almost certainly trumped up, and may have been politically motivated.Phyllis Cunham, in Harriet Flower (ed), The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic, Cambridge University Press, 2004, p.155 googlebooks partial preview. The accusations against Licinia included fraternal incest. She was a contemporary and possible political ally of the Gracchi brothers.

The case was prosecuted by Cicero. *Licinia (flourished 1st century) was supposedly courted by her kinsman, the so-called \\"triumvir\\" Marcus Licinius Crassus ‚Äì who in fact wanted her property. This relationship gave rise to rumors. Plutarch says: \\"And yet when he was further on in years, he was accused of criminal intimacy with Licinia, one of the Vestal virgins and Licinia was formally prosecuted by a certain Plotius. Now Licinia was the owner of a pleasant villa in the suburbs which Crassus wished to get at a low price, and it was for this reason that he was forever hovering about the woman and paying his court to her, until he fell under the abominable suspicion. And in a way it was his avarice that absolved him from the charge of corrupting the Vestal, and he was acquitted by the judges. But he did not let Licinia go until he had acquired her property.\\" Licinia became a Vestal in 85 and remained a Vestal until 61. *Arruntia, Perpennia M. f., Popillia, attended the inauguration of Lucius Cornelius Lentulus Niger as Flamen Martialis in 69.

Vestals in Western art The Vestals were used as models of female virtue in allegorizing portraiture of the later West.

Tuccia herself had been a subject for artists such as Jacopo del Sellaio (d. 1493) and Joannes Stradanus, and women who were arts patrons started having themselves painted as Vestals.Warner, Monuments and Maidens, p. 244. In the libertine environment of 18th century France, portraits of women as Vestals seem intended as fantasies of virtue infused with ironic eroticism.Kathleen Nicholson, \\"The Ideology of Feminine 'Virtue': The Vestal Virgin in French Eighteenth-Century Allegorical Portraiture,\\" in Portraiture: Facing the Subject (Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 58ff. Later vestals became an image of republican virtue, as in Jacques-Louis David's The Vestal Virgin. The discovery of a \\"House of the Vestals\\" in Pompeii made the Vestals a popular subject in the 18th century and the 19th century. =Portraits as Vestals= File:Metsys Elizabeth I The Sieve Portrait c1583.jpgSieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I (1583) by Quentin Metsys the Younger File:Jean Raoux ‚Äì Vestal Virgin.jpgVestal Virgin (1677‚Äì1730) by Jean Raoux File:Madame Henriette de France as a Vestal Virgin (c. 1749) by Jean-Marc Nattier.jpgMadame Henriette de France as a Vestal Virgin (1749) by Jean-Marc Nattier File:Angelica Kauffmann, Portrait of a Woman as a Vestal Virgin, 1780-1785 02.jpgPortrait of a Woman as a Vestal Virgin (1770s) by Angelica Kauffman  References Further reading * Beard, Mary, \\"The Sexual Status of Vestal Virgins,\\" The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 70, (1980), pp. 12‚Äì27. *Broughton, T.

It followed the Byzantine victory at the Battle of Ad Decimum, and eliminated the power of the Vandals for good, completing the \\"Reconquest\\" of North Africa under the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. The main contemporary source for the battle is Procopius, De Bello Vandalico, which occupies Books III and IV of his magisterial Wars of Justinian. Prelude After the great Byzantine victory at the Battle of Ad Decimum, Belisarius and his army captured Carthage. Vandal king Gelimer set up at Bulla Regia in Numidia, about to the west of Carthage (at what is now the western border of modern Tunisia). He knew that in his current state he would not be able to face Belisarius's forces, so he sent messengers to his brother Tzazon who was currently campaigning in Sardinia. When he received the message, Tzazon set about returning to Africa to join Gelimer. Meanwhile, Gelimer also attempted to divide the forces helping Belisarius. He offered rewards to the local Punic and Berber tribes for every Byzantine head they could bring, and sent agents to Carthage to attempt to have the Byzantine Hun mercenaries -- vital to his success at Ad Decimum -- betray him. Tzazon and his army joined Gelimer early in December, at which point Gelimer felt his forces were strong enough to take the offensive. With the two brothers at the head of the army, the Vandal force paused on the way to Carthage to destroy the great aqueduct which supplied the city with most of its water. Belisarius had fortified the city in the twelve weeks since Ad Decimum, but knew about Gelimer's agents and could no longer trust the Huns in his forces. Instead of waiting for a possible treachery during a siege, he formed up his army and marched out with the cavalry at the front, the Byzantines in the center, and the Huns at the rear of the column. Battle The two forces met at Tricamarum, some west of Carthage, and the Byzantine cavalry immediately charged the Vandal lines, reforming and attacking two more times. The Byzantine infantry then furiously attacked the Vandal infantry, and the Byzantines gained the advantage. During the third Byzantine cavalry charge Tzazon was killed within sight of Gelimer. As had happened at Ad Decimum, Gelimer lost heart. The Vandal lines began to retreat, and soon were in rout. Gelimer fled back into Numidia with what remained of his army, having lost 800 men. Belisarius then marched on the city of Hippo Regius, which opened its gates to him. Aftermath Gelimer realized that his kingdom was lost, and attempted to flee to Spain where some Vandals still remained, not having followed the main forces when they crossed into North Africa years earlier. However, the Byzantines heard of his plans and intercepted him. He was forced to abandon his belongings and take refuge in the mountains of Tunis with the Berbers. The next year he was found and surrounded by Roman forces led by Pharas the Herulian. At first he refused to surrender, even after promises of being allowed to rule. After a particularly nasty winter, he eventually gave up and surrendered to Belisarius. The Vandal Kingdom ended, and their provinces in Sardinia, Corsica, and the Balearic Islands came under the control of Justinian. Importance Paul K. Davis writes, \\"With this victory, the Byzantines regained control of North Africa for the Eastern Roman Empire. This position became a springboard for the Byzantine invasion of Italy, and that invasion reincorporated, temporarily, the Eastern and Western Roman Empire.\\".

Although the HTML markup in a web page can be controlled with any text editor, specialized HTML editors can offer convenience and added functionality. For example, many HTML editors handle not only HTML, but also related technologies such as CSS, XML and JavaScript or ECMAScript. In some cases they also manage communication with remote web servers via FTP and WebDAV, and version control systems such as Subversion or Git. Many word processing, graphic design and page layout programs that are not dedicated to web design, such as Microsoft Word or Quark XPress, also have the ability to function as HTML editors. Types of editors There are two main varieties of css editors: text and WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editors. =Text editors= Text editors l intended for use with css usually provide at least class Some editors additionally feature templates, toolbars and keyboard shortcuts to quickly insert common css elements and structures. Wizards, toolbar prompts and autocompletion may help with common tasks. Text editors commonly used for HTML typically include either built-in functions or integration with external tools for such tasks as version control, link-checking and validation, code cleanup and formatting, spell-checking, uploading by FTP or WebDAV, and structuring as a project. Some functions, such as link checking or validation may use online tools, requiring a network connection. Text editors require user understanding of HTML and any other web technologies the designer wishes to use like CSS, JavaScript, and server-side scripting languages. To ease this requirement, some editors allow editing of the markup in more visually organized modes than simple color highlighting, but in modes not considered WYSIWYG. These editors typically include the option of using palette windows or dialog boxes to edit the text-based parameters of selected objects. These palettes allow editing parameters in individual fields, or inserting new tags by filling out an onscreen form, and may include additional widgets to present and select options when editing parameters (such as previewing an image or text styles) or an outline editor to expand and collapse HTML objects and properties. Recommended HTML,CSS,AND JAVASCRIPT EDITOR :anWriter free HTML editor =WYSIWYG HTML editors= Amaya 10 HTML editor WYSIWYG HTML editors provide an editing interface which resembles how the page will be displayed in a web browser. Because using a WYSIWYG editor may not require any HTML knowledge, they are often easier for an inexperienced computer user to get started with. The WYSIWYG view is achieved by embedding a layout engine. This may be custom-written or based upon one used in a web browser. The goal is that, at all times during editing, the rendered result should represent what will be seen later in a typical web browser. WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) is an alternative paradigm to WYSIWYG editors. Instead of focusing on the format or presentation of the document, it preserves the intended meaning of each element. For example, page headers, sections, paragraphs, etc. are labeled as such in the editing program, and displayed appropriately in the browser. Difficulties in achieving WYSIWYG A given HTML document will have an inconsistent appearance on various platforms and computers for several reasons: ;Different browsers and applications will render the same markup differently. :The same page may display slightly differently in Internet Explorer and Firefox on a high-resolution screen, but it will look very different in the perfectly valid text-only Lynx browser. It needs to be rendered differently again on a PDA, an internet-enabled television and on a mobile phone. Usability in a speech or braille browser, or via a screen-reader working with a conventional browser, will place demands on entirely different aspects of the underlying HTML. All an author can do is suggest an appearance. ;Web browsers, like all computer software, have bugs :They may not conform to current standards. It is hopeless to try to design Web pages around all of the common browsers' current bugs: each time a new version of each browser comes out, a significant proportion of the World Wide Web would need re-coding to suit the new bugs and the new fixes. It is generally considered much wiser to design to standards, staying away from 'bleeding edge' features until they settle down, and then wait for the browser developers to catch up to your pages, rather than the other way round. For instance, no one can argue that CSS is still 'cutting edge' as there is now widespread support available in common browsers for all the major features, even if many WYSIWYG and other editors have not yet entirely caught up. ;A single visual style can represent multiple semantic meanings :Semantic meaning, derived from the underlying structure of the HTML document, is important for search engines and also for various accessibility tools. On paper we can tell from context and experience whether bold text represents a title, or emphasis, or something else. But it is very difficult to convey this distinction in a WYSIWYG editor. Simply making a piece of text bold in a WYSIWYG editor is not sufficient to tell the reader *why* the text is bold - what the boldness represents semantically. ;Modern web sites are rarely constructed in a way that makes WYSIWYG useful :Modern web sites typically use a content management system or some other template processor-based means of constructing pages on the fly using content stored in a database. Individual pages are never stored in a filesystem as they may be designed and edited in a WYSIWYG editor, thus some form of abstracted template-based layout is inevitable, invalidating one of the main benefits of using a WYSIWYG editor. Valid HTML markup HTML is a structured markup language. There are certain rules on how HTML must be written if it is to conform to W3C standards for the World Wide Web. Following these rules means that web sites are accessible on all types and makes of computer, to able-bodied and people with disabilities, and also on wireless devices like mobile phones and PDAs, with their limited bandwidths and screen sizes. However, most HTML documents on the web do not meet the requirements of W3C standards. In a study conducted in 2011 on the 350 most popular web sites (selected by the Alexa index), 94 percent of websites fail the web standards markup and style sheet validation tests, or apply character encoding improperly. Even those syntactically correct documents may be inefficient due to an unnecessary use of repetition, or based upon rules that have been deprecated for some years. Current W3C recommendations on the use of CSS with HTML were first formalised by W3C in 1996 and have been revised and refined since then. See CSS, XHTML, W3C's current CSS recommendation and W3C's current HTML recommendation. These guidelines emphasise the separation of content (HTML or XHTML) from style (CSS). This has the benefit of delivering the style information once for a whole site, not repeated in each page, let alone in each HTML element. WYSIWYG editor designers have been struggling ever since with how best to present these concepts to their users without confusing them by exposing the underlying reality. Modern WYSIWYG editors all succeed in this to some extent, but none of them has succeeded entirely. However a web page was created or edited, WYSIWYG or by hand, in order to be successful among the greatest possible number of readers and viewers, as well as to maintain the 'worldwide' value of the Web itself, first and foremost it should consist of valid markup and code. It should not be considered ready for the World Wide Web, until its HTML and CSS syntax have been successfully validated using either the free W3C validator services (W3C HTML Validator and W3C CSS Validator) or some other trustworthy alternatives. Accessibility of web pages by those with physical, eyesight or other disabilities is not only a good idea considering the ubiquity and importance of the web in modern society, but is also mandated by law. In the U.S., the Americans with Disabilities Act and in the UK, the Disability Discrimination Act place requirement on web sites operated by publicly funded organizations. In many other countries similar laws either already exist or soon will. Making pages accessible is more complex than just making them valid; that is a prerequisite but there are many other factors to be considered. Good web design, whether done using a WYSIWYG tool or not needs to take account of these too. Whatever software tools are used to design, create and maintain web pages, the quality of the underlying HTML is dependent on the skill of the person who works on the page. Some knowledge of HTML, CSS and other scripting languages as well as a familiarity with the current W3C recommendations in these areas will help any designer produce better web pages, with a WYSIWYG HTML editor and without.

After working with his father's business, Vanderbilt worked his way into leadership positions in the inland water trade and invested in the rapidly growing railroad industry. Nicknamed \\"The Commodore\\", he is known for owning the New York Central Railroad. His biographer T. J. Stiles says, \\"He vastly improved and expanded the nation's transportation infrastructure, contributing to a transformation of the very geography of the United States. He embraced new technologies and new forms of business organization, and used them to compete....He helped to create the corporate economy that would define the United States into the 21st century.\\" As one of the richest Americans in history and wealthiest figures overall, Vanderbilt was the patriarch of the wealthy and influential Vanderbilt family. He provided the initial gift to found Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. According to historian H. Roger Grant: \\"Contemporaries, too, often hated or feared Vanderbilt or at least considered him an unmannered brute. While Vanderbilt could be a rascal, combative and cunning, he was much more a builder than a wrecker [...] being honorable, shrewd, and hard-working.\\" Ancestry Cornelius Vanderbilt's great-great-great-grandfather, Jan Aertson or Aertszoon (\\"Aert's son\\"), was a Dutch farmer from the village of De Bilt in Utrecht, Netherlands, who emigrated to New Amsterdam (later New York) as an indentured servant in 1650. The Dutch van der (\\"of the\\") was eventually added to Aertson's village name to create \\"van der Bilt\\" (\\"of the Bilt\\"). This was eventually condensed to Vanderbilt. Anthony Janszoon van Salee was Cornelius Vanderbilt's great-great-great-great-grandfather.Nexus: the Bimonthly Newsletter of the New England Historic Genealogical Society, Volumes 13-16. New England Historic Genealogical Society. 1996. p. 21-23 Early years Cornelius Vanderbilt was born in Staten Island, New York on May 27, 1794 to Cornelius van Derbilt and Phebe Hand. He began working on his father's ferry in New York Harbor as a boy, quitting school at the age of 11. At the age of 16, Vanderbilt decided to start his own ferry service. According to one version of events, he borrowed $100 from his mother to purchase a periauger (a shallow draft, two-masted sailing vessel), which he christened the Swiftsure. However, according to the first account of his life, published in 1853, the periauger belonged to his father and the younger Vanderbilt received half the profit. He began his business by ferrying freight and passengers on a ferry between Staten Island and Manhattan. Such was his energy and eagerness in his trade that other captains nearby took to calling him The Commodore in jest ‚Äì a nickname that stuck with him all his life. While many Vanderbilt family members had joined the Episcopal Church, Cornelius Vanderbilt remained a member of the Moravian Church to his death. Along with other members of the Vanderbilt family, he helped erect a local Moravian parish church in his city. On December 19, 1813, at age 19 Vanderbilt married his first cousin, Sophia Johnson, daughter of Nathaniel Johnson and Elizabeth Hand. They moved into a boarding house on Broad Street in Manhattan. They had 13 children together: Phebe in 1814, Ethelinda in 1817, Eliza in 1819, William in 1821, Emily in 1823, Sophia in 1825, Maria in 1827, Frances in 1828, Cornelius Jeremiah in 1830, George in 1832 (who died in 1836), Mary, in 1834, Catherine in 1836, and another son named George in 1839. In addition to running his ferry, Vanderbilt bought his brother-in-law John De Forest's schooner Charlotte and traded in food and merchandise in partnership with his father and others. But on November 24, 1817, a ferry entrepreneur named Thomas Gibbons asked Vanderbilt to captain his steamboat between New Jersey and New York. Although Vanderbilt kept his own businesses running, he became Gibbons's business manager. When Vanderbilt entered his new position, Gibbons was fighting against a steamboat monopoly in New York waters, which had been granted by the New York State Legislature to the politically influential patrician Robert Livingston and Robert Fulton, who had designed the steamboat. Though both Livingston and Fulton had died by the time Vanderbilt started working for Gibbons, the monopoly was held by Livingston's heirs. They had granted a license to Aaron Ogden to run a ferry between New York and New Jersey. Gibbons launched his steamboat venture because of a personal dispute with Ogden, whom he hoped to drive into bankruptcy. To accomplish this, he undercut prices and also brought a landmark legal case ‚Äì Gibbons v. Ogden ‚Äì to the United States Supreme Court to overturn the monopoly. Working for Gibbons, Vanderbilt learned to operate a large and complicated business. He moved with his family to New Brunswick, New Jersey, a stop on Gibbons' line between New York and Philadelphia. There his wife Sophia operated a very profitable inn, using the proceeds to feed, clothe and educate their children. Vanderbilt also proved a quick study in legal matters, representing Gibbons in meetings with lawyers. He also went to Washington, D.C., to hire Daniel Webster to argue the case before the Supreme Court. Vanderbilt appealed his own case against the monopoly to the Supreme Court, which was next on the docket after Gibbons v. Ogden. The Court never heard Vanderbilt's case, because on March 2, 1824, it ruled in Gibbons' favor, saying that states had no power to interfere with interstate commerce. The case is still considered a landmark ruling. The protection of competitive interstate commerce is considered the basis for much of the prosperity which the United States has generated. Steamboat entrepreneur James and John Bard). After Thomas Gibbons died in 1826, Vanderbilt worked for Gibbons' son William until 1829. Though he had always run his own businesses on the side, he now worked entirely for himself. Step by step, he started lines between New York and the surrounding region. First he took over Gibbons' ferry to New Jersey, then switched to western Long Island Sound. In 1831, he took over his brother Jacob's line to Peekskill, New York, on the lower Hudson River. That year he faced opposition by a steamboat operated by Daniel Drew, who forced Vanderbilt to buy him out. Impressed, Vanderbilt became a secret partner with Drew for the next thirty years, so that the two men would have an incentive to avoid competing with each other. On November 8, 1833, Vanderbilt was nearly killed in the Hightstown rail accident on the Camden and Amboy Railroad in New Jersey. Also on the train was former president John Quincy Adams. In 1834, Vanderbilt competed on the Hudson River against the Hudson River Steamboat Association, a steamboat monopoly between New York City and Albany. Using the name \\"The People's Line,\\" he used the populist language associated with Democratic president Andrew Jackson to get popular support for his business. At the end of the year, the monopoly paid him a large amount to stop competing, and he switched his operations to Long Island Sound. During the 1830s, textile mills were built in large numbers in New England as the United States developed its manufacturing base. They processed cotton from the Deep South, so were directly tied to the slave societies. Some of the first railroads in the United States were built from Boston to Long Island Sound, to connect with steamboats that ran to New York. By the end of the decade, Vanderbilt dominated the steamboat business on the Sound, and began to take over management of the connecting railroads. In the 1840s, he launched a campaign to take over the most attractive of these lines, the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad, popularly known as the Stonington. By cutting fares on competing lines, Vanderbilt drove down the Stonington stock price, and took over the presidency of the company in 1847. It was the first of the many railroads he would head. During these years, Vanderbilt also operated many other businesses. He bought large amounts of real estate in Manhattan and Staten Island, and took over the Staten Island Ferry in 1838. It was in the 1830s when he was first referred to as \\"commodore,\\" then the highest rank in the United States Navy. A common nickname for important steamboat entrepreneurs, by the end of the 1840s it was applied only to Vanderbilt. Oceangoing steamship lines Vanderbilt in later life When the California gold rush began in 1849, Vanderbilt switched from regional steamboat lines to ocean-going steamships. Many of the migrants to California, and almost all of the gold returning to the East Coast, went by steamship to Panama, where mule trains and canoes provided transportation across the isthmus. (The Panama Railroad was soon built to provide a faster crossing.) Vanderbilt proposed a canal across Nicaragua, which was closer to the United States and was spanned most of the way across by Lake Nicaragua and the San Juan River. In the end, he could not attract enough investment to build the canal, but he did start a steamship line to Nicaragua, and founded the Accessory Transit Company to carry passengers across Nicaragua by steamboat on the lake and river, with a carriage road between the Pacific port of San Juan del Sur and Virgin Bay on Lake Nicaragua. In 1852, a dispute with Joseph L. White, a partner in the Accessory Transit Company, led to a business battle in which Vanderbilt forced the company to buy his ships for an inflated price. In early 1853, he took his family on a grand tour of Europe in his steamship yacht, the North Star. While he was away, White conspired with Charles Morgan, Vanderbilt's erstwhile ally, to betray him, and deny him money he was owed by the Accessory Transit Company. When Vanderbilt returned from Europe, he retaliated by developing a rival steamship line to California, cutting prices until he forced Morgan and White to pay him off. He then turned to transatlantic steamship lines, running in opposition to the heavily subsidized Collins Line, headed by Edward K. Collins. Vanderbilt eventually drove the Collins Line into extinction. During the 1850s, Vanderbilt also bought control of a major shipyard and the Allaire Iron Works, a leading manufacturer of marine steam engines, in Manhattan. In November 1855, Vanderbilt began to buy control of Accessory Transit once again. That same year, the American military adventurer, William Walker, led an expedition to Nicaragua and briefly took control of the government. Edmund Randolph, a close friend of Walker, coerced the Accessory Transit's San Francisco agent, Cornelius K. Garrison, into opposing Vanderbilt. Randolph convinced Walker to annul the charter of the Accessory Transit Company, and give the transit rights and company steamboats to him; Randolph sold these to Garrison. Garrison brought Charles Morgan in New York into the plan. Vanderbilt took control of the company just before these developments were announced. When he tried to convince the U.S. and English governments to help restore the company to its rights and property, they refused. So he negotiated with Costa Rica, which (along with the other Central American republics) had declared war on Walker. Vanderbilt sent a man to Costa Rica who led a raid that captured the steamboats on the San Juan River, cutting Walker off from his reinforcements from insurgent groups in the United States. Walker was forced to give up, and was conducted out of the country by a U.S. Navy officer. But the new Nicaraguan government refused to allow Vanderbilt to restart the transit business, so he started a line by way of Panama, eventually developing a monopoly on the California steamship business. American Civil War When the Civil War began in 1861, Vanderbilt attempted to donate his largest steamship, the Vanderbilt, to the Union Navy. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles refused it, thinking its operation and maintenance too expensive for what he expected to be a short war. Vanderbilt had little choice but to lease it to the War Department, at prices set by ship brokers. When the Confederate ironclad Virginia (popularly known in the North as the Merrimack) wrought havoc with the Union blockading squadron at Hampton Roads, Virginia, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton and President Abraham Lincoln called on Vanderbilt for help. This time he succeeded in donating the Vanderbilt to the Union navy, equipping it with a ram and staffing it with handpicked officers. It helped bottle up the Virginia, after which Vanderbilt converted it into a cruiser to hunt for the Confederate commerce raider Alabama, captained by Raphael Semmes. For donating the Vanderbilt, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.38th Congress, 13 Stat. 401 Vanderbilt also paid to outfit a major expedition to New Orleans. He suffered a grievous loss when George Washington Vanderbilt II, his youngest and favorite son, and heir apparent, a graduate of the United States Military Academy, fell ill and died without ever seeing combat. Railroad empire James Fisk Jr. in a famous rivalry with the Erie Railroad =New York and Harlem Railroad= Though Vanderbilt had relinquished his presidency of the Stonington Railroad during the California gold rush, he took an interest in several railroads during the 1850s, serving on the boards of directors of the Erie Railway, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Hartford and New Haven, and the New York and Harlem (popularly known as the Harlem). In 1863, Vanderbilt took control of the Harlem in a famous stockmarket corner, and was elected its president. He later explained that he wanted to show that he could take this railroad, which was generally considered worthless, and make it valuable. It had a key advantage: it was the only steam railroad to enter the center of Manhattan, running down 4th Avenue (later Park Avenue) to a station on 26th Street, where it connected with a horse-drawn streetcar line. From Manhattan it ran up to Chatham Four Corners, New York, where it had a connection to the railroads running east and west. Vanderbilt brought his eldest son, Billy, in as vice- president of the Harlem. Billy had had a nervous breakdown early in life, and his father had sent him to a farm on Staten Island. But he proved himself a good businessman, and eventually became the head of the Staten Island Railway. Though the Commodore had once scorned Billy, he was impressed by his son's success. Eventually he promoted him to operational manager of all his railroad lines. In 1864, the Commodore sold his last ships, in order to concentrate on the railroads. =New York Central and Hudson River Railroad= Looking out the north end of the Murray Hill Tunnel towards Grand Central Depot in 1880; note the labels for the New York, Harlem and New York, and New Haven Railroads; the New York Central and Hudson River was off to the left. The two larger portals on the right allowed some horse-drawn trains to continue further downtown. Once in charge of the Harlem, Vanderbilt encountered conflicts with connecting lines. In each case, the strife ended in a battle that Vanderbilt won. He bought control of the Hudson River Railroad in 1864, the New York Central Railroad in 1867, and the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway in 1869. He later bought the Canada Southern as well. In 1870, he consolidated two of his key lines into the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, one of the first giant corporations in United States history. =Grand Central Depot= Grand Central Terminal below the MetLife Building in New York City, New York in 2012. In 1869, Vanderbilt directed the Harlem to begin construction of the Grand Central Depot on 42nd Street in Manhattan. It was finished in 1871, and served as his lines' terminus in New York. He sank the tracks on 4th Avenue in a cut that later became a tunnel, and 4th Avenue became Park Avenue. The depot was replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913. =Rivalry with Jay Gould and James Fisk= In 1868, Vanderbilt fell into a dispute with Daniel Drew, who had become treasurer of the Erie Railway. To get revenge, he tried to corner Erie stock, which led to the so-called Erie War. This brought him into direct conflict with Jay Gould and financier James Fisk Jr., who had just joined Drew on the Erie board. They defeated the corner by issuing \\"watered stock\\" in defiance of state law, which restricted the number of shares a company could issue. But Gould bribed the legislature to legalize the new stock. Vanderbilt used the leverage of a lawsuit to recover his losses, but he and Gould became public enemies. Gould never got the better of Vanderbilt in any other important business matter, but he often embarrassed Vanderbilt, who uncharacteristically lashed out at Gould in public. By contrast, Vanderbilt befriended his other foes after their fights ended, including Drew and Cornelius Garrison. Later years and philanthropy Following his wife Sophia's death in 1868, Vanderbilt went to Canada. On August 21, 1869, in London, Ontario, he married a cousin from Mobile, Alabama, with the name ‚Äî unusual for a woman ‚Äî of Frank Armstrong Crawford. Vanderbilt's second wife convinced him to give , the largest charitable gift in American history to that date, to Bishop Holland Nimmons McTyeire, the husband of her cousin, Amelia Townsend, to found Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, named in his honor. He also paid $50,000 for a church for his second wife's congregation, the Church of the Strangers. In addition, he donated to churches around New York, including a gift to the Moravian Church on Staten Island of for a cemetery (the Moravian Cemetery). He chose to be buried there. Death Vanderbilt family mausoleum at the Moravian Cemetery on Staten Island, where Cornelius is buried Cornelius Vanderbilt died on January 4, 1877, at his residence, ‚Ññ 10 Washington Place, after having been confined to his rooms for about eight months. The immediate cause of his death was exhaustion, brought on by long suffering from a complication of chronic disorders. At the time of his death, aged 82, Vanderbilt had an estimated worth of $105 million. In his will, he left 95% of his $105 million estate to his son William (Billy) and four grandsons through him. This left his only other living son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, and 9 daughters (Phebe Jane, Ethelinda, Eliza, Emily Almira, Sophia Johnson, Maria Louisa, Frances Lavinia, Mary Alicia, and Catherine Juliette), to receive comparatively little inheritance; far less than even their young nephews. Corneel, Ethelinda and Mary took the matter of their father's will to court, claiming he was not in his right mind in his old age when he drew up the will; that he had been behaving strangely and was under William's influence as well as that of a corrupt spiritualist in his employ, who'd allegedly been approached and paid off by William to do his bidding, according to eyewitness testimony. Allegedly, William paid the spiritualist (a Mr. Stoddard) to suggest the \\"spirits\\"‚Äîduring a point in the session when said spiritualist would fall into a \\"trance\\" in the Commodore's presence‚Äîclaimed William would be the most trustworthy to inherit the estate and business and that his other children actually hated him and were just waiting for him to die. A \\"spirit,\\" during this session, came in the form of William's deceased mother, Sophia. Not wanting to risk further public humiliation of the family name in court, William finally settled with his siblings. He gave Corneel an extra $200,000 in cash and a trust fund of $400,000. He gave Mary and Ethelinda the same settlement. Still, all told, comparatively very little from the‚Äîby far‚Äîlargest estate in the world at that time. William's eldest son, Cornelius Vanderbilt II, received $5 million in the will, while his three younger sons‚ÄîWilliam Kissam Vanderbilt, Frederick William Vanderbilt, and George Washington Vanderbilt II‚Äîreceived $2 million apiece. The Commodore said that he believed his son William was the only heir capable of maintaining the business empire. Legacy Statue at the modern Grand Central Terminal Commodore Vanderbilt willed amounts ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 to each of his daughters. His wife received $500,000, their New York City home, and 2,000 shares of common stock in the New York Central Railroad. To his younger surviving son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, whom he regarded as a wastrel, he left the income from a $200,000 trust fund. The Commodore had lived in relative modesty considering his nearly unlimited means, splurging only on race horses. His descendants were the ones who built the Vanderbilt houses that characterize America's Gilded Age. (Although his daughters and Cornelius received bequests much smaller than those of their brother William, these made them very wealthy by the standards of 1877 and were not subject to inheritance tax.) According to The Wealthy 100 by Michael Klepper and Robert Gunther, Vanderbilt would be worth $143 billion in 2007 United States dollars if his total wealth as a share of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1877 (the year of his death) were taken and applied in that same proportion in 2007. This would make him the second-wealthiest person in United States history, after Standard Oil co-founder John Davison Rockefeller (1839‚Äì1937). Another calculation, from 1998, puts him in third place, after Andrew Carnegie. In 1999, Cornelius Vanderbilt was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame, recognizing his significant contributions to the railroad industry. He was inducted in the \\"Railway Workers & Builders: North America\\" category. A statue of Cornelius Vanderbilt is located on the south side of Grand Central Terminal, facing the Park Avenue road viaduct to the south. The bronze statue was sculpted by Ernst Plassmann and was originally sited at the Hudson River Railroad depot at St. John's Park before being moved to Grand Central Terminal in 1929. Descendants Physician Jared Linsly testifying as to the mental and physical condition of Cornelius Vanderbilt during court proceedings surrounding the challenge to his will. From an 1877 illustration in Harper's Weekly. Cornelius Vanderbilt was buried in the family vault in the Moravian Cemetery at New Dorp on Staten Island. He was later reburied in a tomb in the same cemetery constructed by his son Billy. Three of his daughters and son, Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt, contested the will on the grounds that their father was of unsound mind and under the influence of his son Billy and spiritualists whom he consulted on a regular basis. The court battle lasted more than a year and was ultimately won outright by Billy, who increased the bequests to his siblings and paid their legal fees. One of Vanderbilt's great- great-granddaughters, Gloria Vanderbilt, was a renowned fashion designer, and her youngest son, Anderson Cooper, is a television news anchor. Through Billy's daughter Emily Thorn Vanderbilt, another descendant is actor Timothy Olyphant. Cornelius Jeremiah Vanderbilt was childless when he committed suicide, in 1882, and George Washington Vanderbilt died during the Civil War, before having any children. All of the Vanderbilt multimillionaires descend through the oldest son Billy and his wife. Cornelius' youngest grandson through William, George Washington Vanderbilt II, built the 250-room Biltmore Estate in the mountains of Asheville, North Carolina, as his main residence with part of his inheritance from his grandfather. It still retains the title of the largest privately owned home in the United States, though it is open to the public. The mansion contains of total floor space and originally sat on of land. It now sits on due to George's final wishes that be sold to the government at ‚Äì a significantly cut rate and what George had originally paid ‚Äì in order to form the core of the Pisgah National Forest, as well as George's widow, Edith Stuyvesant Vanderbilt Gerry, being forced to sell off additional land to pay for the Estate's upkeep.

He came to prominence in Stan Kenton's orchestra before forming his own big band in 1957. He was noted for his bands, which often served as stepping stones for up-and-coming talent, his versatility on several instruments, and his ability to play in a high register. Biography=Early life and education= Ferguson was born in Verdun (now part of Montreal), Quebec. Encouraged by his mother and father (both musicians), he started playing piano and violin at the age of four. At nine years old, he heard a cornet for the first time in his local church and asked his parents to buy one for him. When he was thirteen, he soloed with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra. He was heard frequently on the CBC, notably featured on a \\"Serenade for Trumpet in Jazz\\" written for him by Morris Davis. He won a scholarship to the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al where he studied from 1943 to 1948 with Bernard Baker. Ferguson dropped out of the High School of Montreal when he was fifteen to pursue a music career, performing in dance bands led by Stan Wood, Roland David, and Johnny Holmes. Although trumpet was his primary instrument, he also performed on other brass and reed instruments. He took over the dance band formed by his saxophonist brother Percy, playing dates in the Montreal area and serving as an opening act for touring bands from Canada and the U.S. During this period, he came to the attention of American bandleaders and began receiving offers to go to the U.S. In 1948, Ferguson moved to the United States, intending to join Stan Kenton's band, but it no longer existed, so Ferguson played with the bands of Boyd Raeburn, Jimmy Dorsey, and Charlie Barnet. The Barnet band included Doc Severinsen, Ray Wetzel, Johnny Howell, and Rolf Ericson. Ferguson was featured on Barnet's recording of \\"All The Things You Are\\" by Jerome Kern. The recording enraged Kern's widow and was withdrawn from sale. =Kenton and Hollywood= In January 1950, Kenton formed the Innovations Orchestra, a 40-piece jazz orchestra with strings. After the folding of the Barnet band, Ferguson was available for the first rehearsal on January 1. One of the Orchestra's recordings was named \\"Maynard Ferguson,\\" one of a series of pieces named after featured soloists. When Kenton returned to a more practical 19-piece jazz band, Ferguson continued with him at third chair with numerous solo features. Notable recordings from this period that feature Ferguson include \\"Invention for Guitar and Trumpet\\", \\"What's New?\\", and \\"The Hot Canary\\". In 1953, Ferguson left Kenton and spent the next three years a session musician for Paramount Pictures. He appeared on 46 soundtracks, including The Ten Commandments. He also played on several other non-Paramount film soundtracks, usually those with jazz scores. Ferguson can clearly be discerned on several soundtracks from the time, including the Martin and Lewis films \\"Living It Up\\" and \\"You're Never Too Young.\\" He still recorded jazz, but his Paramount contract prevented him from playing in jazz clubs. This was sometimes circumvented by appearing under aliases such as \\"Tiger Brown\\" or \\"Foxy Corby\\". Although he enjoyed the steady income, he was unhappy with the lack of live performance opportunities and left Paramount in 1956. =The Birdland Dream Band= Ferguson played with the P√©rez Prado Orchestra on the LP Havana 3 A.M., recorded in February and March 1956. In 1956, he joined the Birdland Dream Band, a 14-piece big band formed by Morris Levy as an \\"all- star\\" lineup to play at Levy's Birdland jazz club in New York City. Although the name \\"Birdland Dream Band\\" was short-lived and is represented by only two albums over the course of a year, this band became the core of Ferguson's performing band for the next nine years. The band included Mike Abene, Jaki Byard, Bill Chase, Ronnie Cuber, Frankie Dunlop, Don Ellis, Joe Farrell, Dusko Goykovich, Tony Inzalaco, Rufus Jones, Willie Maiden, Ron McClure, Rob McConnell, Don Menza, Lanny Morgan, Wayne Shorter, and Joe Zawinul. Those who were both arrangers and performers included Herb Geller, Slide Hampton, Bill Holman, and Don Sebesky. In 1959 Ferguson was a guest with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Leonard Bernstein performing Symphony No. 2 in C \\"Titans\\" by William Russo. In 1961, Ferguson composed the theme music for the 1961‚Äì1962 ABC adventure drama television series Straightaway. His 1961 album \\"Straightaway\\" Jazz Themes contained the music he composed for the series. As big bands declined in popularity and economic viability in the 1960s, Ferguson's band performed less frequently. He began to feel musically stifled and sensed a resistance to change among his American jazz audiences. According to an interview in Down Beat, he was quoted as saying that if the band did not play \\"Maria\\" or \\"Ole,\\" the fans went home disappointed. He began performing with a sextet before shutting down his big band in 1966. =Millbrook, India, and psychedelics= After leaving his long- time recording contract and the end of his main club gig, Ferguson moved his family to the Hitchcock Estate in Millbrook, New York in November 1963 to live with Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, and their community from Harvard University. He and his wife Flo used LSD, psilocybin and other psychedelic drugs. They lived at Millbrook for about three years, playing clubs and recording several albums. Ferguson was mentioned in The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, which detailed the psychedelic scene. In 1967, as the Millbrook experiment was ending, Ferguson moved his family to India and taught at the Krishnamurti- based Rishi Valley School near Madras. He was associated with the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning's Boys Brass Band, which he founded and helped teach for several years. While in India, he was influenced by Sathya Sai Baba, whom he considered as his spiritual guru. =England and jazz rock= As a Canadian in England, Ferguson avoided the union's ban on American musicians. In 1969, he moved to Oakley Green, a hamlet on the outskirts of Windsor, near London. He had two houses while he was in the UK, the final one a three-story house by the River Thames. That same year, Ferguson signed with CBS Records. He started a sixteen- to eighteen-piece big band with British musicians playing jazz rock. The band got attention for its version of \\"MacArthur Park\\" by Jim Webb. Ferguson's band made its North American debut in 1971. In 1970 he led the band on The Simon Dee Show from London Weekend Television. =Return to the U.S.= Ferguson in San Francisco, 1978 Ferguson moved to New York City in 1973, then relocated to Ojai, California less than two years later. He replaced the British band members with American musicians while reducing membership to twelve: four trumpets, two trombones, three saxophones, and a three-piece rhythm section. Albums from this period include M.F. Horn 4&5: Live At Jimmy's and Chameleon, recorded in 1973 and 1974 in New York. Ferguson took advantage of the burgeoning jazz education movement by hiring musicians from colleges with jazz programs, such as Berklee College of Music, North Texas State University and the University of Miami. He performed for young audiences and gave master classes in colleges and high schools. This strategy helped him develop an audience that sustained him for the rest of his career. In 1975, Ferguson began working with Bob James on a series of commercially successful albums with large groups of session musicians, including strings, vocalists, and guest soloists. The first of these albums was Primal Scream, featuring Chick Corea, Mark Colby, Steve Gadd, and Bobby Militello. The second, Conquistador (1976) yielded a No. 22 pop single, \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" from the movie Rocky, earning him a gold album. He maintained a hectic touring schedule. The commercial success included adding a guitarist and an additional percussionist to his band's lineup. In the summer of 1976, Ferguson performed a solo trumpet piece for the closing ceremonies of the Summer Olympics in Montreal, symbolically \\"blowing out the flame\\". Ferguson became frustrated with Columbia over the inability to use his working band on albums and to play jazz songs on them. His contract with Columbia ended after the release of the album Hollywood (1982), produced by bassist Stanley Clarke. During that time, he recorded an instrumental version of the Michael Jackson song \\"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough\\"; the song would later be used by Rede Globo as the theme song of V√≠deo Show, which ran on the network between 1983 and 2019. Ferguson recorded three big band albums with smaller labels before forming High Voltage, a fusion septet, in 1986. This smaller ensemble, which featured multi-reed player Denis DiBlasio, gave Ferguson the freedom explore in a less structured format. High Voltage recorded two albums, produced by Jim Exon, his manager and son in law. =Big Bop Nouveau= To mark his 60th birthday in 1988, Maynard Ferguson returned to a large band format and to more mainstream jazz. That then led to the formation of Big Bop Nouveau, a nine- piece band featuring two trumpets, one trombone, three reeds and a three-piece rhythm section which became his standard touring group for the remainder of his career. Later, due to the increasing responsibilities being placed on the trumpet players, the baritone sax position was replaced by a third trumpet player. The band's repertoire included original jazz compositions and modern arrangements of jazz standards, with occasional pieces from his '70s book and even modified charts from the Birdland Dream Band era; this format proved to be successful with audiences and critics. The band recorded extensively, including albums backing vocalists Diane Schuur and Michael Feinstein. Big Bop Nouveau toured the world extensively; in 2005 it embarked on a tour of eight months playing an average of two hundred shows a year. The group was tour managed by Memphis legend Ed Sargent, and mixed by audio mogul Mike Freeland. Although in later years Ferguson's playing occasionally lost some of the range and phenomenal accuracy of his youth, he always remained an exciting performer, touring an average of nine months a year with Big Bop Nouveau for the remainder of his life. Ferguson died on August 23, 2006. During the late 1980s, Ferguson returned to a big band format when he formed Big Bop Nouveau. He made albums with this band until the end of the next decade. Personal life In 1973, Ferguson settled in Ojai, California, where he lived to the end of his life. His first marriage was to singer Kay Brown. His marriage to Flo Ferguson (in 1956) lasted until her death on February 27, 2005. Ferguson had three daughters: Corby, Lisa, and Wilder, a step daughter, Kim, through Flo's marriage to Jim Hamza, and a son, Bentley, who predeceased his parents. Kim Ferguson is married to Maynard's former manager, Jim Exon. Wilder Ferguson is married to jazz pianist ( film composer and former Big Bop Nouveau member) Christian Jacob. Lisa Ferguson is a writer and film maker living in Los Angeles. At the time of his death, Ferguson had two granddaughters, Erica and Sandra. Ferguson died as a result of kidney and liver failure, on August 23, 2006, at the Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, California.Jon Thurber (August 25, 2006). ‚ÄúMaynard Ferguson, 78; Trumpeter, Big Band Leader Achieved Pop Success‚Äù. Los Angeles Times. Versatility Ferguson was guest star in Italy on TV show with the orchestra conducted by Pino Presti in 1977. Although his principal instrument was the trumpet, Ferguson frequently doubled on other brass instruments, most notably the relatively uncommon valve trombone. Several recording sessions with bandleader Russell Garcia included a four- trombone ensemble in which Ferguson played only valve trombone. Publicity shots and album covers from the 1950s showed Ferguson with his 'quartet' of trumpet, valve trombone, baritone horn, and French horn. Recordings of the latter two are rare; the French horn vanished in later years, but the baritone horn appeared on the 1974 album Chameleon. He switched to the combination valve/slide Superbone and flugelhorn on all but his last recorded album. Ferguson designed: the Firebird and the Superbone. The Firebird was similar to a trumpet, but the valves were played with the left hand instead of the right, and a trombone-style slide was played with the right hand. Trumpeter Rajesh Mehta bought this trumpet while living in Amsterdam and played the Firebird from 1998 until 2011 when he had American trumpet maker George Schlub create the Orka-M Naga Phoenix trumpet for him. The Superbone was another hybrid instrument, a trombone with additional valves played with the left hand. Ferguson incorporated Indian instruments and influences in his music. Ferguson was not the first trumpeter to play in the extreme upper register (such as Cat Anderson), but he could play high notes with full, rich tone, power, and musicality. In interviews he said that his command of the upper registers was based mostly on breath control, something he discovered as a kid in Montreal. He attributed the longevity of his technique to the spiritual and yoga studies he pursued in India. Ferguson brought charisma to a musical genre that is often seen as cold and cerebral. His obituary in The Washington Post stated: > \\"Ferguson lit up thousands of young horn players, most of them boys, with > pride and excitement. In a (high school) world often divided between jocks > and band nerds, Ferguson crossed over, because he approached his music > almost as an athletic event. On stage, he strained, sweated, heaved and > roared. He nailed the upper registers like Shaq nailing a dunk or Lawrence > Taylor nailing a running back - and the audience reaction was exactly the > same: the guttural shout, the leap to their feet, the fists in the air. We > cheered Maynard as a gladiator, a combat soldier, a prize fighter, a circus > strongman - choose your masculine archetype.\\" Awards and honors Ferguson was appointed a Member of the Order of Canada in 2003. In 1950, 1951, and 1952, Ferguson won the Down Beat Readers' Poll for best trumpeter. In 1992, he was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. In 2000, Ferguson was initiated as a brother of Kappa Kappa Psi at the Gamma Xi Chapter (University of Maryland at College Park). In 2006, he was presented with Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity's Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award at its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio. He had been initiated as an honorary member of the Fraternity's Xi Chi Chapter at Tennessee Tech University in 1976. The Maynard Ferguson Institute of Jazz Studies at Rowan University was created in 2000, the same year Rowan bestowed Ferguson with his only Honorary Doctorate degree. The Institute, under direction of Ferguson's friend Denis Diblasio, supports the Rowan Jazz Program in training young jazz musicians. Maynard Ferguson band alumni regrouped for a memorial concert soon after his death, led by trumpeters Wayne Bergeron, Patrick Hession, Walter White, and Eric Miyashiro. In 2000, he was given an Honorary Doctorate Degree by Rowan University in Glassboro, New Jersey, and created the Maynard Ferguson Institute of Jazz Studies under the direction of Denis DiBlasio in their College of Performing Arts. The Sherman Jazz Museum in Sherman, Texas opened in 2010 and houses the extensive memorabilia of Ferguson's estate.

Indian literature also had an influence through the spread of Buddhism in Japan. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style, although the influence of Chinese literature and Classical Chinese remained. Following Japan's reopening of its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western literature has influenced the development of modern Japanese writers, while they have in turn been more recognized outside Japan, with two Nobel Prizes so far, as of 2020. History=-period literature (before 794)= Before the introduction of kanji from China to Japan, Japan had no writing system; it is believed that Chinese characters came to Japan at the very beginning of the fifth century, brought by immigrants from the mainland of Korean and Chinese descent. Early Japanese texts first followed the Chinese model, before gradually transitioning to a hybrid of Chinese characters used in Japanese syntactical formats, resulting in sentences written with Chinese characters but read phonetically in Japanese. Chinese characters were also further adapted, creating what is known as , the earliest form of , or Japanese syllabic writing. The earliest literary works in Japan were created in the period. These include the (712), a historical record that also chronicles ancient Japanese mythology and folk songs; the (720), a chronicle written in Chinese that is significantly more detailed than the ; and the (759), a poetry anthology. One of the stories they describe is the tale of . =Heian literature (794‚Äì1185)= , the author of The Tale of . The Heian period has been referred to as the golden era of art and literature in Japan. During this era, literature became centered on a cultural elite of nobility and monks. The imperial court particularly patronized the poets, most of whom were courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the poetry was elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style. Editing the resulting anthologies of poetry soon became a national pastime. The poem, now one of two standard orderings for the Japanese syllabary, was also developed during the early Heian period. The Tale of Genji (), written in the early 11th century by a woman named , is considered the pre-eminent novel of Heian fiction. Other important writings of this period include the (905), a -poetry anthology, and The Pillow Book () (990s). The Pillow Book was written by , 's contemporary and rival, as an essay about the life, loves, and pastimes of nobles in the Emperor's court. Another notable piece of fictional Japanese literature was , a collection of over a thousand stories in 31 volumes. The volumes cover various tales from India, China and Japan. The 10th-century Japanese narrative, The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter (), can be considered an early example of proto-science fiction. The protagonist of the story, , is a princess from the Moon who is sent to Earth for safety during a celestial war, and is found and raised by a bamboo cutter. She is later taken back to her extraterrestrial family in an illustrated depiction of a disc- shaped flying object similar to a flying saucer. (cf. ) = period literature (1185‚Äì1603)= During the Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333), Japan experienced many civil wars which led to the development of a warrior class, and subsequent war tales, histories, and related stories. Work from this period is notable for its more somber tone compared to the works of previous eras, with themes of life and death, simple lifestyles, and redemption through killing. A representative work is The Tale of the Heike () (1371), an epic account of the struggle between the and clans for control of Japan at the end of the twelfth century. Other important tales of the period include 's (1212) and 's (1331). Despite a decline in the importance of the imperial court, aristocratic literature remained the center of Japanese culture at the beginning of the period. Many literary works were marked by a nostalgia for the Heian period. The period also saw a renewed vitality of poetry, with a number of anthologies compiled, such as the compiled in the early 1200s. However, there were fewer notable works by female authors during this period, reflecting the lowered status of women. As the importance of the imperial court continued to decline, a major feature of literature (1333‚Äì1603) was the spread of cultural activity through all levels of society. Classical court literature, which had been the focal point of Japanese literature up until this point, gradually disappeared. New genres such as , or linked verse, and Noh theater developed among the common people, and such as the Nihon Ryoiki were created by Buddhist priests for preaching. The development of roads, along with a growing public interest in travel and pilgrimages, brought rise to the greater popularity of travel literature from the early 13th to 14th centuries. Notable examples of travel diaries include (1432) and (1480). =Edo-period literature (1603‚Äì1868)= Self-Portrait by (1584‚Äì1645), a swordsman, writer, and artist, and the author of The Book of Five Rings (). Literature during this time was written during the largely peaceful Tokugawa Period (commonly referred to as the Edo Period). Due in large part to the rise of the working and middle classes in the new capital of Edo (modern Tokyo), forms of popular drama developed which would later evolve into kabuki. The and kabuki dramatist (1653‚Äì1725) became popular at the end of the 17th century, and he is also known as Japan's Shakespeare. Many different genres of literature made their d√©but during the Edo Period, helped by a rising literacy rate among the growing population of townspeople, as well as the development of lending libraries. (1642‚Äì1693) might be said to have given birth to the modern consciousness of the novel in Japan, mixing vernacular dialogue into his humorous and cautionary tales of the pleasure quarters, the so-called (\\"floating world\\") genre. 's Life of an Amorous Man is considered the first work in this genre. Although 's works were not regarded as high literature at the time because it had been aimed towards and popularized by the (merchant classes), they became popular and were key to the development and spread of . (1644‚Äì1694) is recognized as the greatest master of haiku (then called ) His poems were influenced by his firsthand experience of the world around him, often encapsulating the feeling of a scene in a few simple elements. He made his life's work the transformation of into a literary genre. For , involved a combination of comic playfulness and spiritual depth, ascetic practice, and involvement in human society. In particular, wrote a major work in the form of a travel diary and considered \\"one of the major texts of classical Japanese literature.\\"Bash≈ç 1996b: 7. (1703‚Äì1775) is widely regarded as one of the greatest haiku poets. Before her time, haiku by women were often dismissed and ignored. Her dedication toward her career not only paved a way for her career but it also opened a path for other women to follow. Her early poems were influenced by , although she did later develop her own unique style as an independent figure in her own right. While still a teenager, she had already become very popular all over Japan for her poetry. Her poems, although mostly dealing with nature, work for unity of nature with humanityPatricia Donegan and Yoshie Ishibashi. Chiyo-ni: Woman Haiku Master, Tuttle, 1996. p256 Her own life was that of the poets who made their lives and the world they lived in one with themselves, living a simple and humble life.

The polymath (1728‚Äì1780) was a scholar of and a writer of popular fiction. (1733‚Äì1817) was a Japanese scholar known for his translation of (New Book of Anatomy) from the Dutch-language anatomy book '. As a full-blown translation from a Western language, it was the first of its kind in Japan. Although there was a minor Western influence trickling into the country from the Dutch settlement at Nagasaki, it was the importation of Chinese vernacular fiction that proved the greatest outside influence on the development of Early Modern Japanese fiction.

(1760‚Äì1849), perhaps Japan's most famous woodblock print artist, also illustrated fiction as well as his famous 36 Views of Mount Fuji. Nevertheless, in the period, as in earlier periods, scholarly work continued to be published in Chinese, which was the language of the learned much as Latin was in Europe.Earl, David Margery, Emperor, and Nation in Japan; Political Thinkers of the Tokugawa Period, University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1964, p 12 =, and early -period literature (1868‚Äì1945)= The Meiji period marked the re-opening of Japan to the West, ending over two centuries of national seclusion, and marking the beginning of a period of rapid industrialization. The introduction of European literature brought free verse into the poetic repertoire. It became widely used for longer works embodying new intellectual themes. Young Japanese prose writers and dramatists faced a suddenly-broadened horizon of new ideas and artistic schools, with novelists amongst some of the first to assimilate these concepts successfully into their writing. 's (1867‚Äì1916) humorous novel (I Am a Cat, 1905) employed a cat as the narrator, and he also wrote the famous novels (1906) and (1914). , and , who was called \\"god of the novel\\" as the most prominent \\"I novel\\" writer, were instrumental in adopting and adapting Western literary conventions and techniques. is known especially for his historical short stories. , and represent a strain of writers whose style hearkens back to early-Modern Japanese literature.

Then Realism was brought in by and in the mid-Meiji period (late 1880s‚Äìearly 1890s) while the Classicism of and gained popularity. , a rare female writer in this era, wrote short stories on powerless women of this age in a simple style in between literary and colloquial. , a favored disciple of , pursued a flowing and elegant style and wrote early novels such as The Operating Room (1895) in literary style and later ones including The Holy Man of Mount (1900) in colloquial language. Romanticism was brought in by with his anthology of translated poems (1889) and carried to its height by , alongside magazines such as and in the early 1900s. also wrote some modern novels including The Dancing Girl (1890), The Wild Geese (1911), then later wrote historical novels. , who is often compared with , wrote I Am a Cat (1905) with humor and satire, then depicted fresh and pure youth in (1906) and (1908). He eventually pursued transcendence of human emotions and egoism in his later works including (1914) his last and unfinished novel Light and darkness (1916). shifted from Romanticism to Naturalism which was established with his The Broken Commandment (1906) and 's Futon (1907). Naturalism hatched \\"I Novel\\" () that describes the authors themselves and depicts their own mental states. Neo-romanticism came out of anti-naturalism and was led by and others in the early 1910s. and others founded a magazine in 1910. They shared a common characteristic, Humanism.

's short story \\"The American School\\" portrays a group of Japanese teachers of English who, in the immediate aftermath of the war, deal with the American occupation in varying ways. Prominent writers of the 1970s and 1980s were identified with intellectual and moral issues in their attempts to raise social and political consciousness. One of them, published his best-known work, A Personal Matter in 1964 and became Japan's second winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

The 1988 Prize went to (ja) for Ripening Summer, a story capturing the complex psychology of modern women.

Some of 's best-known works include Norwegian Wood (1987) and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1994‚Äì1995). , a best-selling contemporary author whose \\"manga-esque\\" style of writing sparked much controversy when she debuted in the late 1980s, has come to be recognized as a unique and talented author over the intervening years. Her writing style stresses dialogue over description, resembling the script of a manga, and her works focus on love, friendship, and loss. Her breakout work was 1988's Kitchen. Although modern Japanese writers covered a wide variety of subjects, one particularly Japanese approach stressed their subjects' inner lives, widening the earlier novel's preoccupation with the narrator's consciousness. In Japanese fiction, plot development and action have often been of secondary interest to emotional issues. In keeping with the general trend toward reaffirming national characteristics, many old themes re-emerged, and some authors turned consciously to the past. Strikingly, Buddhist attitudes about the importance of knowing oneself and the poignant impermanence of things formed an undercurrent to sharp social criticism of this material age. There was a growing emphasis on women's roles, the Japanese persona in the modern world, and the malaise of common people lost in the complexities of urban culture. Popular fiction, non-fiction, and children's literature all flourished in urban Japan in the 1980s. Many popular works fell between \\"pure literature\\" and pulp novels, including all sorts of historical serials, information-packed docudramas, science fiction, mysteries, detective fiction, business stories, war journals, and animal stories. Non-fiction covered everything from crime to politics. Although factual journalism predominated, many of these works were interpretive, reflecting a high degree of individualism. Children's works re-emerged in the 1950s, and the newer entrants into this field, many of the younger women, brought new vitality to it in the 1980s. Manga (comics) has penetrated almost every sector of the popular market. It includes virtually every field of human interest, such as multivolume high-school histories of Japan and, for the adult market, a manga introduction to economics, and pornography. Manga represented between 20 and 30 percent of annual publications at the end of the 1980s, in sales of some ¬•400 billion per year. Cell phone novels appeared in the early 21st century. Written by and for cell phone users, the novels ‚Äî typically romances read by young women ‚Äî have become very popular both online and in print. Some, such as Love Sky, have sold millions of print copies, and at the end of 2007 cell phone novels comprised four of the top five fiction best sellers.  Female authors  Female writers in Japan enjoyed a brief period of success during the Heian period, but were undermined following the decline in power of the Imperial Court in the 14th century. Later, in the Meiji era, earlier works written by women such as and were championed amongst the earliest examples of the Japanese literary language, even at a time when the authors themselves experienced challenges due to their gender. One Meiji era writer, , sought to encourage positive comparisons between her contemporaries and their feminine forebears in the hopes that female authors would be viewed with respect by society, despite assuming a public role outside the traditional confines of a woman's role in her home (see ).

","title":"Japanese literature"},{"id":"165630","text":"The Battle of San Jacinto (), fought on April 21, 1836, in present-day Houston, Texas, was the decisive battle of the Texas Revolution. Led by General Samuel Houston, the Texan Army engaged and defeated General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna's Mexican army in a fight that lasted just 18 minutes. A detailed, first-hand account of the battle was written by General Houston from the headquarters of the Texan Army, San Jacinto, on April 25, 1836.General Samuel Houston, Texan Officials, HQ of the Army, April 25, 1836 reproduced in the Daily National Intelligencer, Jun 11, 1836, Vol. XXIV, Issue 7280, p.2, Washington, DC Numerous secondary analyses and interpretations have followed. General Santa Anna, the President of Mexico, and General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos both escaped during the battle. Santa Anna was captured the next day on April 22 and Cos on April 24, 1836. After being held for about three weeks as a prisoner of war, Santa Anna signed the peace treaty that dictated that the Mexican army leave the region, paving the way for the Republic of Texas to become an independent country. These treaties did not necessarily recognize Texas as a sovereign nation, but stipulated that Santa Anna was to lobby for such recognition in Mexico City. Sam Houston became a national celebrity, and the Texans' rallying cries from events of the war, \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Remember Goliad\\" became etched into Texan history and legend. Background: December 1832 ‚Äì March 1836=Mexican constitution overturned= General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was a proponent of governmental federalism when he helped oust Mexican president Anastasio Bustamante in December 1832. Upon his election as president in April 1833,Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 28 Santa Anna switched his political ideology and began implementing centralist policies that increased the authoritarian powers of his office.Poyo (1996), pp. 42‚Äì43, \\"Under the Mexican Flag\\" (Andr√©s Tijerina) His abrogation of the Constitution of 1824, correlating with his abolishing local-level authority over Mexico's state of Coahuila y Tejas (Coahuila and Texas), became a flashpoint in the growing tensions between the central government and its Tejano and Anglo citizens in Texas. While in Mexico City awaiting a meeting with Santa Anna, Texian empresario Stephen F. Austin wrote to the B√©xar ayuntamiento (city council) urging a break-away state. In response, the Mexican government kept him imprisoned for most of 1834.Henderson (2008), pp. 86‚Äì87Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 30‚Äì31 Colonel Juan Almonte was appointed director of colonization in Texas,Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 49, 57 ostensibly to ease relations with the colonists and mitigate their anxieties about Austin's imprisonment.Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 38‚Äì39 He delivered promises of self- governance, and conveyed regrets that the Mexican congress deemed it constitutionally impossible for Texas to be a separate state. Behind the rhetoric, his covert mission was to identify the local power brokers, obstruct any plans for rebellion, and supply the Mexican government with data that would be of use in a military conflict. For nine months in 1834, under the guise of serving as a government liaison, Almonte traveled through Texas and compiled an all-encompassing intelligence report on the population and its environs, including an assessment of their resources and defense capabilities.Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 42‚Äì44, 208‚Äì283 =Cos is appointed military governor of Texas= In consolidating his power base, Santa Anna installed General Mart√≠n Perfecto de Cos as the governing military authority over Texas in 1835.Davis (2004), p. 143.Todish et al. (1998), p. 121. Cos established headquarters in San Antonio on October 9, triggering what became known as the Siege of B√©xar.Menchaca, Poche, Matovina, de la Teja (2013), p. 63 After two months of trying to repel the Texian forces, Cos raised a white flag on December 9, and signed surrender terms two days later. The surrender of Cos effectively removed the occupying Mexican army from Texas. Many believed the war was over, and volunteers began returning home.Poyo (1996), p. 54, \\"Efficient in the Cause\\" (Stephen L. Harden) In compliance with orders from Santa Anna, Mexico's Minister of War Jos√© Mar√≠a Tornel issued his December 30 \\"Circular No. 5\\", often referred to as the Tornel Decree, aimed at dealing with United States intervention in the uprising in Texas. It declared that foreigners who entered Mexico for the purpose of joining the rebellion were to be treated as \\"pirates\\", to be put to death if captured. In adding \\"since they are not subjects of any nation at war with the republic nor do they militate under any recognized flag,\\" Tornel avoided declaring war on the United States.Calore (2014), p. 56Todish et al. (1998), pp. 137‚Äì138 =Santa Anna takes the Alamo= The Mexican Army of Operations numbered 6,019 soldiersHardin (2004), p. 15 and was spread out over on its march to B√©xar. General Joaqu√≠n Ram√≠rez y Sesma was put in command of the Vanguard of the Advance that crossed into Texas.Todish et al. (1998), p. 34. Santa Anna and his aide-de-camp AlmonteJackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 351‚Äì352 forded the Rio Grande at Guerrero, Coahuila on February 16, 1836,Hardin (2004), p. 25 with General Jos√© de Urrea and 500 more troops following the next day at Matamoros.Hardin (2004), p. 21 B√©xar was captured on February 23 and, when the assault commenced, attempts at negotiation for surrender were initiated from inside the fortress. William B. Travis, the garrison commander, sent Albert Martin to request a meeting with Almonte, who replied that he did not have the authority to speak for Santa Anna.; Edmondson (2000), pp. 306‚Äì307; Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 367‚Äì368 Bowie dispatched Green B. Jameson with a letter, translated into Spanish by Juan Segu√≠n, requesting a meeting with Santa Anna, who immediately refused. Santa Anna did, however, extend an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress. Alamo non-combatant survivor Enrique Esparza said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer.Poyo (1996), p. 53, 58 \\"Efficient in the Cause\\" (Stephen L. Harden); Lindley (2003), p. 94, 134 Cos, in violation of his surrender terms, forded into Texas at Guerrero on February 26 to join with the main army at B√©xar.Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 366‚Äì367, 208‚Äì283 Urrea proceeded to secure the Gulf Coast, and was victorious in two skirmishes with Texian detachments serving under Fannin at Goliad. On February 27 a foraging detachment under Frank W. Johnson at San Patricio was attacked by Urrea. Sixteen were killed, and 21 taken prisoner, but Johnson and 4 others escaped.Hardin (2004), p. 53Jackson, Wheat (2005), p. 372 Urrea sent a company to Agua Dulce searching for James Grant and Pl√°cido Benavides who were leading a company of Anglos and Tejanos towards an invasion of Matamoros. The Mexicans set a trap, killing Grant and most of the company. Benavides and 4 others escaped, and 6 were taken prisoner. The Convention of 1836 met at Washington-on-the-Brazos on March 1.Hardin (1994), 161 The following day, Sam Houston's 42nd birthday, the 59 delegates signed the Texas Declaration of Independence, and chose an ad interim government.Lack (1992), p. 83 When news of the declaration reached Goliad, Benavides informed Fannin that in spite of his opposition to Santa Anna, he was still loyal to Mexico and did not wish to help Texas break away. Fannin discharged him from his duties and sent him home.Hardin-Teja (2010) pp. 64‚Äì66 On March 4 Houston's military authority was expanded to include \\"the land forces of the Texian army both Regular, Volunteer, and Militia.\\"Moore (2004), p. 14 At 5 a.m. on March 6, the Mexican troops launched their final assault on the Alamo. The guns fell silent 90 minutes later; the Alamo had fallen.Jackson, Wheat (2005), pp. 373‚Äì374 Survivors Susannah Dickinson, her daughter Angelina, Travis' slave Joe, and Almonte's cook Ben were spared by Santa Anna and sent to Gonzales, where Texian volunteers had been assembling.Moore (2004), pp. 37‚Äì38 Retreat: March‚ÄìMay 1836=Texian retreat: The Runaway Scrape= Sam Houston The same day that Mexican troops departed B√©xar, Houston arrived in Gonzales and informed the 374 volunteers (some without weapons) gathered there that Texas was now an independent republic.Moore (2004), pp. 43, 48, 52, 57. Just after on March 13, Susanna Dickinson and Joe brought news that the Alamo garrison had been defeated and the Mexican army was marching towards Texian settlements. A hastily convened council of war voted to evacuate the area and retreat. The evacuation commenced at midnight and happened so quickly that many Texian scouts were unaware the army had moved on. Everything that could not be carried was burned, and the army's only two cannons were thrown into the Guadalupe River.Moore (2004), pp. 55‚Äì59. When Ram√≠rez y Sesma reached Gonzales the morning of March 14, he found the buildings still smoldering.Moore (2004), p. 71. Most citizens fled on foot, many carrying their small children. A cavalry company led by Segu√≠n and Salvador Flores were assigned as rear guard to evacuate the more isolated ranches and protect the civilians from attacks by Mexican troops or Indians.Moore (2004), p. 60. The further the army retreated, the more civilians joined the flight.Davis (2006), p. 243. For both armies and the civilians, the pace was slow; torrential rains had flooded the rivers and turned the roads into mud pits.Hardin (1994), p. 182. As news of the Alamo's fall spread, volunteer ranks swelled, reaching about 1,400 men on March 19. Houston learned of Fannin's defeat on March 20 and realized his army was the last hope for an independent Texas. Concerned that his ill-trained and ill-disciplined force would be good for only one battle, and aware that his men could easily be outflanked by Urrea's forces, Houston continued to avoid engagement, to the immense displeasure of his troops.Hardin (1994), pp. 183‚Äì184. By March 28, the Texian army had retreated across the Navidad and Colorado Rivers.Moore (2004), pp. 71, 74, 87, 134. Many troops deserted; those who remained grumbled that their commander was a coward. On March 31, Houston paused his men at Groce's Landing, roughly north of San Felipe.Groce's Landing is located roughly northeast of modern-day Bellville. Moore (2004), p. 149. Two companies that refused to retreat further than San Felipe were assigned to guard the crossings on the Brazos River.Moore (2004), pp. 134‚Äì137. For the next two weeks, the Texians rested, recovered from illness, and, for the first time, began practicing military drills. While there, two cannons, known as the Twin Sisters, arrived from Cincinnati, Ohio.Hardin (1994), p. 189. Interim Secretary of War Thomas Rusk joined the camp, with orders from President David G. Burnet to replace Houston if he refused to fight. Houston quickly persuaded Rusk that his plans were sound. Secretary of State Samuel P. Carson advised Houston to continue retreating all the way to the Sabine River, where more volunteers would likely flock from the United States and allow the army to counterattack.After getting inaccurate reports that several thousand Indians had joined the Mexican army to attack Nacogdoches, American General Edmund P. Gaines and 600 troops crossed into Texas. This would have provoked a war if they had encountered the Mexican army, which might have followed Houston if he continued his retreat. Reid (2007), pp. 152‚Äì153.Davis (2006), p. 263. Unhappy with everyone involved, Burnet wrote to Houston: \\"The enemy are laughing you to scorn. You must fight them. You must retreat no further. The country expects you to fight. The salvation of the country depends on your doing so.\\" Complaints within the camp became so strong that Houston posted notices that anyone attempting to usurp his position would be court-martialed and shot.Moore (2004), p. 185. Santa Anna and a smaller force had remained in B√©xar. After receiving word that the acting president, Miguel Barrag√°n, had died, Santa Anna seriously considered returning to Mexico City to solidify his position. Fear that Urrea's victories would position him as a political rival convinced Santa Anna to remain in Texas to personally oversee the final phase of the campaign.Davis (2006), p. 254. He left on March 29 to join Ram√≠rez y Sesma, leaving only a small force to hold B√©xar.Moore (2004), p. 154. At dawn on April 7, their combined force marched into San Felipe and captured a Texian soldier, who informed Santa Anna that the Texians planned to retreat further if the Mexican army crossed the Brazos River.Moore (2004), p. 176. Unable to cross the Brazos due to the small company of Texians barricaded at the river crossing, on April 14 a frustrated Santa Anna led a force of about 700 troops to capture the interim Texas government.Hardin (1994), p. 190.Moore (2004), p. 182. Government officials fled mere hours before Mexican troops arrived in Harrisburgh (now Harrisburg, Houston) and Santa Anna sent Colonel Juan Almonte with 50 cavalry to intercept them in New Washington. Almonte arrived just as Burnet shoved off in a rowboat, bound for Galveston Island. Although the boat was still within range of their weapons, Almonte ordered his men to hold their fire so as not to endanger Burnet's family.Hardin (1994), p. 191. At this point, Santa Anna believed the rebellion was in its final death throes. The Texian government had been forced off the mainland, with no way to communicate with its army, which had shown no interest in fighting. He determined to block the Texian army's retreat and put a decisive end to the war. Almonte's scouts incorrectly reported that Houston's army was going to Lynchburg Crossing, on Buffalo Bayou, in preparation for joining the government in Galveston, so Santa Anna ordered Harrisburg burned and pressed on towards Lynchburg. The Texian army had resumed their march eastward. On April 16, they came to a crossroads; one road led north towards Nacogdoches, the other went to Harrisburg. Without orders from Houston and with no discussion amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg. They arrived on April 18, not long after the Mexican army's departure.Hardin (1994), pp. 190‚Äì193. That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to \\"Remember the Alamo\\" and \\"Remember Goliad\\". His army then raced towards Lynchburg.Hardin (1994), pp. 199‚Äì200. Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the Tejanos in Segu√≠n's company, Houston originally ordered Segu√≠n and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. After loud protests from Segu√≠n and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the Tejanos wear playing cards in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.Hardin (1994), p. 209. =San Jacinto= San Jacinto Battlefield with troop movements The area along Buffalo Bayou had many thick oak groves, separated by marshes. This type of terrain was familiar to the Texians and quite alien to the Mexican soldiers. Houston's army, comprising 900 men, reached Lynch's Ferry mid-morning on April 20; Santa Anna's 700-man force arrived a few hours later. The Texians made camp in a wooded area along the bank of Buffalo Bayou; while the location provided good cover and helped hide their full strength, it also left the Texians no room for retreat.Hardin (1994), pp. 200‚Äì201.Moore (2004), p. 258. Over the protests of several of his officers, Santa Anna chose to make camp in a vulnerable location, a plain near the San Jacinto River, bordered by woods on one side, marsh and lake on another.Hardin (1994), p. 202.Moore (2004), p. 283. The two camps were approximately apart, separated by a grassy area with a slight rise in the middle.Hardin (1994), p. 208. Colonel Pedro Delgado later wrote that \\"the camping ground of His Excellency's selection was in all respects, against military rules. Any youngster would have done better.\\"Moore (2004), p. 287. Scouting Mexican lancers were taunted by the Texian fife and drum tune \\"Will you come to the bower?\\". Over the next several hours, two brief skirmishes occurred. Using the Twin Sisters, Texians won the first, forcing a small group of dragoons and the Mexican artillery to withdraw. Mexican dragoons then forced the Texian cavalry to withdraw. In the melee, Rusk, on foot to reload his rifle, was almost captured by Mexican soldiers, but was rescued by newly arrived Texian volunteer Mirabeau B. Lamar.Hardin (1994), p. 203. Over Houston's objections, many infantrymen rushed onto the field. As the Texian cavalry fell back, Lamar remained behind to rescue another Texian who had been thrown from his horse; Mexican officers \\"reportedly applauded\\" his bravery.Hardin (1994), p. 204. Houston was irate that the infantry had disobeyed his orders and given Santa Anna a better estimate of their strength; the men were equally upset that Houston had not allowed a full battle.Davis (2006), p. 267. Throughout the night, Mexican troops worked to fortify their camp, creating breastworks out of everything they could find, including saddles and brush.Hardin (1994), p. 205. At on April 21, Cos arrived with 540 reinforcements, bringing the Mexican force to approximately 1200-1500 men which outnumbered the Texian aggregate forces of approximately 800 men (official count entering battle was reported at 783).Houston, 1836, op cit General Cos' men were mostly raw recruits rather than experienced soldiers, and they had marched steadily for more than 24 hours, with no rest and no food.Moore (2004), p. 292. As the morning wore on with no Texian attack, Mexican officers lowered their guard. By afternoon, Santa Anna had given permission for Cos' men to sleep; his own tired troops also took advantage of the time to rest, eat, and bathe.Moore (2004), p. 328. Not long after Cos arrived with reinforcements, General Houston ordered Smith to destroy Vince's Bridge (located about 8 miles from the Texian encampment) to block the only road out of the Brazos and, thereby, prevent any possibility of escape by Santa Anna.Houston, Texian Army HQ Report from San Jacinto, 1836 op cit General Sam Houston described how he arrayed the Texian forces in preparation of battle: \\"Colonel Edward Burleson was assigned the center. The second regiment, under the command of Colonel Sydney Sherman, formed the left wing of the army. The artillery, under the special command of Col. Geo. W. Hackley, inspector general, was placed on the right of the first regiment, and four companies under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Millard, sustained the artillery on the right, and our cavalry, sixty-one in number and commanded by Colonel Mirabeau B. Lamar...placed on our extreme right, composed our line.\\" Houston, Texian Army HQ Report from San Jacinto, 1836, op cit San Jacinto Battlefield The Texian cavalry was first dispatched to the Mexican forces' far left and the artillery advanced through the tall grass to within 200 yards of the Mexican breastworks. The Texian Twin Sisters fired at 4:30, beginning the battle of San Jacinto.Moore (2004), p. 210. After a single volley, Texians broke ranks and swarmed over the Mexican breastworks, yelling \\"Remember the Alamo! Remember La Bahia (Goliad)!\\", to engage in hand-to-hand combat. Mexican soldiers were taken by surprise. Santa Anna, Castrill√≥n, and Almonte yelled often conflicting orders, attempting to organize their men into some form of defense.Moore (2004), p. 211. The Texian infantry forces advanced without halt until they had possession of the woodland and the Mexican breastwork; the right wing of Burleson's and the left wing of Millard's forces took possession of the breastwork. Within 18 minutes, Mexican soldiers abandoned their campsite and fled for their lives.Davis (2006), p. 271. The killing lasted for hours.Hardin (1994), p. 213. Many Mexican soldiers retreated through the marsh to Peggy Lake.Peggy Lake, also called Peggy's Lake, no longer exists. It was located southeast of the Mexican breastworks, which is now the site of the monument. Hardin (2004) pp. 71, 93 Texian riflemen stationed themselves on the banks and shot at anything that moved. Many Texian officers, including Houston and Rusk, attempted to stop the slaughter, but they were unable to gain control of the men, incensed and vengeful for the massacres at the Alamo and Goliad, while frightened Mexican infantry yelled \\"Me no Alamo!\\" and begged for mercy to no avail.Hardin (1994), pp. 211‚Äì215. In what historian Davis called \\"one of the most one-sided victories in history\\",Davis (2006), p. 274. 650 Mexican soldiers were killed and 300 captured.Hardin (1994), p. 215. Eleven Texians died, with 30 others, including Houston, wounded.Moore (2004), p. 364. Although Santa Anna's troops had been thoroughly vanquished, they did not represent the bulk of the Mexican army in Texas. An additional 4,000 troops remained under the commands of Urrea and General Vicente Filisola.Davis (2006), p. 272. Texians had won the battle due to mistakes made by Santa Anna, and Houston was well aware that his troops would have little hope of repeating their victory against Urrea or Filisola.Davis (2006), p. 273. As darkness fell, a large group of prisoners was led into camp. Houston initially mistook the group for Mexican reinforcements and reportedly shouted out that all was lost.Davis (2006), p. 276. =Mexican retreat= \\"Surrender of Santa Anna\\" by William Henry Huddle shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston, battle of San Jacinto Santa Anna had escaped towards Vince's Bridge.Moore (2004), p. 353. Finding the bridge destroyed, he hid in the marsh and was captured the following day, wearing the uniform jacket of a private. This subterfuge was uncovered when other Mexican prisoners cried out in recognition of their commander. He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded.Lamar thought Houston was deliberately shot by one of his own men. Moore (2004), p. 339. Texian soldiers gathered around, calling for the Mexican general's immediate execution. Bargaining for his life, Santa Anna suggested that he order the remaining Mexican troops to stay away.Hardin (1994), p. 216. In a letter to Filisola, who was now the senior Mexican official in Texas, Santa Anna wrote that \\"yesterday evening [we] had an unfortunate encounter\\" and ordered his troops to retreat to B√©xar and await further instructions. Urrea urged Filisola to continue the campaign. He was confident that he could challenge the Texian troops. According to Hardin, \\"Santa Anna had presented Mexico with one military disaster; Filisola did not wish to risk another.\\"Hardin (1994), p. 245. Spring rains had ruined the ammunition and rendered the roads nearly impassable, with troops sinking to their knees in mud. The Mexican troops were soon out of food and began to fall ill from dysentery and other diseases. Their supply lines had broken down, leaving no hope of further reinforcements.Hardin (1994), p. 246. Filisola later wrote that \\"Had the enemy met us under these cruel circumstances, on the only road that was left, no alternative remained but to die or surrender at discretion\\".Davis (2006), p. 277. For several weeks after San Jacinto, Santa Anna continued to negotiate with Houston, Rusk, and then Burnet.Davis (2006), p. 279. Santa Anna suggested two treaties, a public version of promises made between the two countries, and a private version that included Santa Anna's personal agreements. The Treaties of Velasco required that all Mexican troops withdraw south of the Rio Grande and that all private property be respected and restored. Prisoners of war would be released unharmed and Santa Anna would be given immediate passage to Veracruz. He secretly promised to persuade the Mexican Congress to acknowledge the Republic of Texas and to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between the two countries.Davis (2006), p. 282. When Urrea began marching south in mid-May, many families from San Patricio who had supported the Mexican army went with him. When Texian troops arrived in early June, they found only 20 families remaining. The area around San Patricio and Refugio suffered a \\"noticeable depopulation\\" in the Republic of Texas years.Lack (1992), p. 180. Although the treaty had specified that Urrea and Filisola would return any slaves their armies had sheltered, Urrea refused to comply. Many former slaves followed the army to Mexico, where they could be free.Lack (1992), p. 245. By late May, the Mexican troops had crossed the Nueces. Filisola fully expected that the defeat was temporary and that a second campaign would be launched to retake Texas. Aftermath=Military= April 21, 1906 Army of the Republic of Texas veteran reunion. L‚ÄìR are William P. Zuber, John W. Darlington, Aca C. Hill, Stephen F. Sparks, L. T. Lawlor and Alfonso Steele. All participated in the Battle of San Jacinto, as well as other skirmishes.Moore (2004) p. 242 When Mexican authorities received word of Santa Anna's defeat at San Jacinto, flags across the country were lowered to half staff and draped in mourning.Henderson (2008), p. 103. Denouncing any agreements signed by a prisoner, Mexican authorities refused to recognize the Republic of Texas. Filisola was derided for leading the retreat and quickly replaced by Urrea. Within months, Urrea gathered 6,000 troops in Matamoros, poised to reconquer Texas. His army was redirected to address continued federalist rebellions in other regions.Davis (2006), p. 289. Most in Texas assumed the Mexican army would return quickly. So many American volunteers flocked to the Texian army in the months after the victory at San Jacinto that the Texian government was unable to maintain an accurate list of enlistments.Davis (2006), p. 291. Out of caution, B√©xar remained under martial law throughout 1836. Rusk ordered that all Tejanos in the area between the Guadalupe and Nueces Rivers migrate either to east Texas or to Mexico.Lack (1992), p. 201. Some residents who refused to comply were forcibly removed. New Anglo settlers moved in and used threats and legal maneuvering to take over the land once owned by Tejanos.Davis (2006), p. 288.Lack (1992), p. 206. Over the next several years, hundreds of Tejano families resettled in Mexico. For years, Mexican authorities used the reconquering of Texas as an excuse for implementing new taxes and making the army the budgetary priority of the impoverished nation. Only sporadic skirmishes resulted.Henderson (2008), p. 125. Larger expeditions were postponed as military funding was consistently diverted to other rebellions, out of fear that those regions would ally with Texas and further fragment the country.Vazquez (1985), p. 315.New Mexico, Sonora, and California revolted unsuccessfully; their stated goals were a change in government, not independence. Henderson (2008), p. 100. Vazquez (1985), p. 318. The northern Mexican states, the focus of the Matamoros Expedition, briefly launched an independent Republic of the Rio Grande in 1839.Reid (2007), p. 169. The same year, the Mexican Congress considered a law to declare it treasonous to speak positively of Texas.Henderson (2008), p. 123. In June 1843, leaders of the two nations declared an armistice.Henderson (2008), p. 127. =Republic of Texas= The Republic of Texas, including the disputed territory On June 1, Santa Anna boarded a ship to travel back to Mexico. For the next two days, crowds of soldiers, many of whom had arrived that week from the United States, gathered to demand his execution. Lamar, by now promoted to Secretary of War, gave a speech insisting that \\"Mobs must not intimidate the government. We want no French Revolution in Texas!\\", but on June 4 soldiers seized Santa Anna and put him under military arrest.Lack (1992), p. 104. Burnet called for elections to ratify the constitution and elect a Congress,Lack (1992), p. 107. the sixth set of leaders for Texas in a twelve-month period.Lack (1992), p. 256. Voters overwhelmingly chose Houston the first president, ratified the constitution drawn up by the Convention of 1836, and approved a resolution to request annexation to the United States.Davis (2006), p. 295. Houston issued an executive order sending Santa Anna to Washington, D.C., and from there he was soon sent home.Davis (2006), p. 301. During his absence, Santa Anna had been deposed. Upon his arrival, the Mexican press wasted no time in attacking him for his cruelty towards those executed at Goliad. In May 1837, Santa Anna requested an inquiry into the event.Vazquez (1985), p. 316. The judge determined the inquiry was only for fact-finding and took no action; press attacks in both Mexico and the United States continued.Vazquez (1985), p. 317. Santa Anna was disgraced until the following year, when he became a hero of the Pastry War.Henderson (2008), p. 116. Legacy The San Jacinto Monument San Jacinto Battle Flag in the Texas House of Representatives The San Jacinto Battleground State Historic Site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. The site includes the San Jacinto Monument, which was erected by the Public Works Administration. Authorized April 21, 1936, and dedicated April 21, 1939, the monument cost $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ).Buisseret, Francaviglia, Graves, Saxon (2009), p. 75Moore (2004), p. 426. The site hosts a San Jacinto Day festival and battle re-enactment each year in April. Both the Texas Navy and the United States Navy have commissioned ships named after the Battle of San Jacinto: the and three ships named . There has been one civilian passenger ship named SS San Jacinto. *Texas Navy schooner San Jacinto was commissioned in 1839 and decommissioned in 1840 after she was wrecked at Cayos Arcas. *The first was a screw frigate launched by the United States Navy in 1850. She was in service with the Africa Squadron in 1860 when she captured the slave ship Storm King. The frigate was in service for most of the American Civil War until she wrecked in the Bahamas in 1865.Silverstone (2006), p. 15 * was a United States civilian passenger ship built in 1903 by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works for the New York and Texas Steamship Company. The US Navy considered acquiring the civilian passenger-cargo ship, for use during World War I as USS San Jacinto (ID-1531), but never acquired or commissioned her. On April 21, 1942, the ship was sunk by a German U-boat.Hampton Roads Naval Historical Foundation (2014), p. 71 *The second was a United States Navy World War II light aircraft carrier commissioned in December 1943, and was decommissioned in 1947.Green (2015), pp. 56, 107 *The third is a currently active guided missile cruiser commissioned by the US Navy in 1988. When the veteran battleship was decommissioned in 1948 and made into a museum ship, it was decided to give her a permanent new anchorage near the San Jacinto Monument, at San Jacinto State Park. Her arrival from Baltimore, where she was decommissioned, was timed for April 21, 1948 ‚Äì the 112th anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto.

Ana da Silva (vocals, guitar) and Gina Birch (vocals, bass) formed the group in 1977 while they were students at Hornsey College of Art in London.\\"Women and the Rock Business, and the story of the Raincoats\\" The Open University 7 February 2005 open.ac.uk ‚Äì Retrieved: 28 July 2007 Signed to the label Rough Trade, the band released three albums in their early incarnation: The Raincoats (1979), Odyshape (1981), and Moving (1984). They reformed in 1993 and released the album Looking in the Shadows in 1996. History=1977‚Äì1993= da Silva and Birch were inspired to make a band after they saw The Slits perform live earlier that year. Birch stated in an interview with She Shreds magazine, \\"It was as if suddenly I was given permission. It never occurred to me that I could be in a band. Girls didn‚Äôt do that. But when I saw The Slits doing it, I thought, ‚ÄòThis is me. This is mine.‚Äô‚Äù For the band's first concert on 9 November 1977 at The Tabernacle, the line-up included Birch, da Silva, Ross Crighton (guitar) and Nick Turner (drums). Kate Korus (from The Slits and later the Mo- dettes) joined briefly but was replaced by Jeremie Franko. Nick Turner left to form the Barracudas, and Richard Dudanski (ex-The 101ers and later Public Image Ltd.) sat in on drums, while filmmaker Patrick Keiller replaced Franko on guitar. Late in 1978, the Raincoats became an all female band as they were joined by The Slits' ex-drummer Palmolive and the classically trained violinist Vicky Aspinall, with this line-up making their live debut at Acklam Hall in London on 4 January 1979.Ian Penman: The Raincoats Dresden Banks Vincent Units Acklam Hall. In: New Musical Express 27 January 1979, page 43. Managed by Shirley O'Loughlin, the band went on their first UK tour with Swiss female band Kleenex, in May 1979 after Rough Trade Records released their first single, \\"Fairytale in the Supermarket\\". Johnny Rotten was an early admirer of the band, and later stated: \\"The Raincoats offered a completely different way of doing things, as did X-Ray Spex and all the books about punk have failed to realise that these women were involved for no other reason than that they were good and original\\". The Raincoats' distinctly uncommercial sound did not appeal to everyone; after witnessing an early performance by the band, Danny Baker remarked that \\"they are so bad that every time a waiter drops a tray we'd all get up and dance\\". On 21 November 1979, Rough Trade released the band's self-titled debut album,Stuart Murdoch: My Top 10 albums observer.guardian.co.uk ‚Äì Retrieved: 28 July 2007 which received considerable acclaim from the press. Palmolive had left the band in September, shortly before The Raincoats came out, and teenager Ingrid Weiss joined the band on drums. The Raincoats' second album, Odyshape, was released in 1981 and featured Weiss as well as drumming contributions from Dudanski, Robert Wyatt (The Soft Machine) and Charles Hayward (This Heat). The Raincoats employed a diverse selection of cheap second-hand instruments such as the balophone, kalimba and gamelan on Odyshape, and the album incorporated British folk, dub basslines, polyrhythmic percussion and elements of free jazz among other world music influences. Its eclectic mix of musical genres has been described as one of the \\"great lost moments of women-in-rock\\". > \\"The basic theme in rock'n'roll is what goes on between men and > women...Rock'n'roll is based on black music. And it's based in the exclusion > of women and the ghettoization of blacks. Which is why we want to put a bit > of distance between what we do and the rock'n'roll tradition.\\" ‚Äî The > Raincoats interviewed by Greil Marcus In December 1982, the Raincoats recorded a live album at The Kitchen arts space in New York. The Kitchen Tapes was released on cassette by ROIR in 1983.The Kitchen Tapes roir-usa.com ‚Äì Retrieved: 28 July 2007 The Raincoats recorded Moving in 1984. Tired of constant touring and \\"pulling in different musical directions\\", the band members began work on solo projects shortly after the album's release. Birch and Aspinall formed Dorothy, while da Silva worked with choreographer Gaby Agis on a series of dance projects and formed Roseland with Hayward. In 1992, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana went into the Rough Trade Shop in Talbot Road, London in search of a new copy of The Raincoats, and Jude Crighton sent him around the corner to see da Silva at her cousin's antique shop. Cobain wrote passionately about this meeting in the liner notes of Nirvana's Incesticide album. In late 1993, Rough Trade and DGC Records reissued the band's three studio albums, with liner notes by Cobain and Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon. > \\"I don't really know anything about the Raincoats except that they recorded > some music that has affected me so much that, whenever I hear it I'm > reminded of a particular time in my life when I was (shall we say) extremely > unhappy, lonely, and bored.

Later, Cobain listed the Raincoats debut album at No. 20 in his 50 favorite albums. =1994‚Äìpresent= O'Loughlin persuaded Birch and da Silva to play a show at The Garage in London in March 1994 with Steve Shelley (Sonic Youth) on drums and Anne Wood on violin to celebrate the album re-releases. They recorded a session for BBC Radio 1's John Peel, which was released as Extended Play on Paul Smith's Blast First and Shelley's label Smells Like Records. Cobain invited them to play on Nirvana's planned UK tour in April, but he died a week before the tour began. The Raincoats released Looking in the Shadows on Rough Trade/Geffen in 1996, produced by Britpop producer Ed Buller (who had previously worked with Suede and Pulp). Musicians included Wood (violin, bass), Heather Dunn (drums) and Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks). In 1995, the Tim/Kerr label released a Raincoats compilation, Fairytales. Since 1996, the Raincoats have played some special events such as Wyatt's Meltdown in 2001, and Chicks on Speed's 99 Cents album release party in Berlin in December 2003. Birch and da Silva recorded a cover version of \\"Monk Chant\\" for a tribute album of Monks songs called Silver Monk Time, and performed the song live with the Monks at Berlin's Volksb√ºhne in October 2006. They played at Ladyfest in Leeds in April 2007, and the Nuits Sonores Festival in Lyon on 18 May 2007. On 28 March 2009, The Raincoats-Fairytales-A Work in Progress, directed by Birch and produced by the Raincoats, was screened at the British Film Institute in London. On 25 April, the band performed at Donaufestival in Austria. On 9 November 2009, the Raincoats' debut album was reissued on vinyl on We ThRee (the band's own label) in the UK and on the Kill Rock Stars label in the U.S. The band performed at Matt Groening's All Tomorrow's Parties festival in May 2010 at Minehead in Somerset. The following week, the Raincoats played their debut album live for an ATP Don't Look Back concert at London's Scala, supported by the Raincoats-influenced band Trash Kit. On 21 November 2010, the Raincoats performed a concert as part of the PopRally series at MoMA in New York City. The band were invited by Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel to perform their debut album live at the All Tomorrow's Parties festival in March 2012. In December 2011, it was announced that The Raincoats would also appear at the 35 Denton music festival in Texas the same month. The Raincoats invited Angel Olsen to collaborate for the 40th anniversary of Rough Trade at London's Islington Assembly Hall on 3 November 2016. On 5 October 2017, Jenn Pelly's 33‚Öì book The Raincoats, about the band's first album, was published by Bloomsbury.

Such sermons occur regularly, as prescribed by the teachings of all legal schools. The Islamic tradition can be formally observed at the Dhuhr (noon) congregation prayer on Friday. In addition, similar sermons are called for on the two festival days and after Solar and Lunar Eclipse prayer. Origins and definition Religious narration (including sermons) may be pronounced in a variety of settings and at various times. The khutbah, however, refers to khutbat al-jum'a, usually meaning the address delivered in the mosque at weekly (usually Friday) and annual rituals. Other religious oratory and occasions of preaching are described as dars (a lesson) or waz (an admonition), and their formats differ accordingly.\\"Khutba\\", Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World The khutbah originates from the practice of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, who used to deliver words of exhortation, instruction, or command at gatherings for worship in the mosque, which consisted of the courtyard of his house in Medina. After the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad presented himself as a khatib to the city in AD 630. The first four caliphs, and the Ummayads caliphs and provincial governors all delivered sermons. There were not necessarily exhortatory, but addressed practical questions of government and sometimes even included direct orders. Under the Abbasids, the caliph himself no longer preached, but assigned the task to the religious judges. The Abbasids insisted they were clearing Islam of the secularism of the Umayads, and this probably helped in strengthening the religious aspect of the sermon.\\"Khutba\\", Students' Britannica India, p.236 Delivery At the beginning of the service the adhan is given, during which the khatib (the individual who delivers the khutbah) remains sitting. The iqama is given when the khatib descends. The sermon is delivered in two parts. Both parts are delivered while khatib is standing and punctuated by a pause in between them when the khatib sits down. During the sermon itself, it is obligatory to pronounce the following: *the hamdala, or an expression to praise God and show gratitude towards him; saying al-hamdu li'llƒÅh \\"Praise belongs to AllƒÅh\\" at the beginning of the sermon is usually sufficient,\\"·∏§amdala\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam *the salawaat, or invocations of peace and blessings on Muhammad, *recitation of a part of the Qur'an in the first part of the sermon or, according to some doctrines, in both, *admonitions to piety in both parts of the sermon, *and dua (prayer) on behalf of the faithful. The khatib must be in a state of ritual purity; his dress must be in accord with the prescriptions. It is commendable for the khatib to be on a pulpit or an elevated place; to salute the congregation when directing himself towards them; to sit down until the adhan is pronounced by the muezzin; and to direct himself straightway to his audience. Finally the khatib should make the sermon short.\\"Khutba\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam In medieval Islam, sermons were generally delivered in classical Arabic. This linguistic requirement that required substantial training on the part of the khatib, and a notable degree of education on the part of listeners, especially non-Arab Muslims. This expectation contributed to the growth of a literary genre consisting of model sermons, such as those by the renowned ibn Nubata (d. 984). Later on, however, preaching in colloquial languages, while often retaining certain Arabic expressions, has become increasingly common.  Activities prohibited during the Khutbah  * Talking * Offering Sunnat and Nafl salaat (permissible) * Eating and drinking * Using Mobile Phone * Reciting the Quran Shareef Friday Worshipers listening to a sermon at the National Mosque of Malaysia One of the conditions for the validity of the Friday service is that it must be preceded by two sermons. The sermons are delivered when the number of auditors required for a valid jÃ≤umu‚Äòa are present. Traditionally, as instructed in classical Islamic legal treatises, Friday congregational prayers in which sermons were delivered were restricted to urban centers and normally to one major mosque in each city. Such a mosque is referred to as a masjid jami‚Äò, that is, a \\"Friday Mosque\\" (or a \\"cathedral mosque\\"). These mosques were distinguished by their central location, large dimensions, monumental architecture, symbolic furnishings indicative of its exalted stature, and, the most demonstrative of all, the minbar (ritual pulpit). In contemporary times, Friday congregational prayers with sermons are common in mosques of all sizes and conditions, and not just restricted to a few central locations. sermons are also dispensed through newspapers and broadcast on radio and television. Special occasions Muslim males can be seen attending Khutbah as part of the Eid-ul-Adha prayers. Photo taken at Barashalghar union of Comilla's Debidwar upazila. Sermons on special occasions generally contain features that are relevant to the celebrations (e.g. Eid) or the natural phenomena for which they are delivered (e.g. Kusuf and Khusuf). For instance, on Eid al-Fitr, the preacher has a duty to instruct the faithful congregation concerning the zakat, or almsgiving. On Eid al-Adha the preacher includes remarks specifying the rules for the sacrifice. There is a slight difference in the sermon delivered on Eid ul-Fitr. The sermon's first part must open with nine takbirs, the second part with seven. The sermon may also be pronounced while sitting. Regarding the sermons delivered during an eclipse or excessive drought, classical texts advise that such sermons must admonish the audience and ask God's forgiveness. Usually the verse 9 of S≈´ra LXVI is also recited and a special prayer called \\"Mu·∏•ammad's du'a\\" æ is said. Sovereign's name In the pre-modern Middle East, the mention of a ruler's name in the sermon was one of the two prerogatives of sovereignty (the other being the right to mint coins). Mentioning meant accepting the sovereignty and suzerainty of a ruler, and it was considered the principal criterion of sovereignty for an Islamic ruler. Omitting the name of a ruler from the sermon was like publicly declaring independence. This prerogative of sovereignty was introduced by Islam. It was not present in the pre-Islamic era. In addition, the sermon, a major vehicle of communication, also announced the deposition of a ruler, the accession of a ruler, nomination of an heir, and the beginning and end of a war.Lewis p. 82-5 The sovereign's name was also declared in khutbas during the Mughal rule; Babur was styled 'Zahir-ud-Din B√°bar Muhammad' during Friday khutbas. Sher Khan, an adversary of the Mughal emperor Humayun, was content if Bengal was given to him in return of the emperor retaining his right to mint coins and proclaim the khutba in the emperor's name, and thereby becoming the \\"emperor's vassal\\". Currently, some Muslim monarchies practise this in their state-regulated sermon like in Brunei and Malaysia. Khutbah and the Ministries of Islamic Affairs in modern states In a number of countries like Turkey, the Gulf States, Saudi Arabia etc. there is a central religious authority supervised by the government which issues a weekly sermon to be read in all mosques under its jurisdiction. In Turkey the sermons are prepared by the Diyanet, in Saudi Arabia by the Ministry for Islamic Affairs. In Egypt a similar proposal is currently being discussed.Egypt's new plan: 1 weekly sermon for over 80 million Muslims http://www.al- monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/07/egypt-unified-text-friday-sermon- criticism-mosques.html#ixzz4F2K6JT9k Related concept Abu-al-Faraj ibn Al- Jawzi writes in his Ru'≈´s al-QawƒÅrƒ´r of a similar concept also called khutbah. Also referred to by the same name as the sermon, this concept was different. Its primary purpose was not to admonish, instruct or reprove, but rather to exalt and praise God. It invited others to worship and celebrate God's greatness. Ibn al-Jawzi employed a variety of metaphors and alluded to nature frequently.Hovannisian, p. 41-3 See also *Nahj al Balagha *Qur'an reading *Sermon, Christian analogue *The sermon for Necessities- a popular sermon in the Islamic world, particularly as the introduction to a khutbah during Jumu'ah.

Wolfe wrote four lengthy novels as well as many short stories, dramatic works, and novellas. He is known for mixing highly original, poetic, rhapsodic, and impressionistic prose with autobiographical writing. His books, written and published from the 1920s to the 1940s, vividly reflect on American culture and the mores of that period, filtered through Wolfe's sensitive, sophisticated, and hyper-analytical perspective. After Wolfe's death, contemporary author William Faulkner said that Wolfe may have been the greatest talent of their generation for aiming higher than any other writer. Wolfe's influence extends to the writings of Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac, and of authors Ray Bradbury and Philip Roth, among others. He remains an important writer in modern American literature, as one of the first masters of autobiographical fiction, and is considered North Carolina's most famous writer. Early life Wolfe was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the youngest of eight children of William Oliver Wolfe (1851‚Äì1922) and Julia Elizabeth Westall (1860‚Äì1945). His siblings were sister Leslie E. Wolfe (1885-1886), Effie Nelson Wolfe (1887-1950), Frank Cecil Wolfe (1888-1956), Mabel Elizabeth Wolfe (1890-1958), Grover Cleveland Wolfe (1892-1904), Benjamin Harrison Wolfe (1892-1918), and Frederick William Wolfe (1894-1980). Six of the children lived to adulthood. The Wolfes lived at 92 Woodfin Street, where Tom was born. His father, a successful stone carver, ran a gravestone business. W.O. Wolfe's business used an angel in the window to attract customers. Thomas Wolfe \\"described the angel in great detail\\" in a short story and in Look Homeward, Angel. The angel was sold and, while there was controversy over which one was the actual angel, the location of the \\"Thomas Wolfe angel\\" was determined in 1949 to be Oakdale Cemetery in Hendersonville, North Carolina. Wolfe's mother took in boarders and was active in acquiring real estate. In 1904, she opened a boarding house in St. Louis for the World's Fair. While the family was in St. Louis, 12-year-old Grover died of typhoid fever. Thomas Wolfe House, 48 Spruce Street in Asheville In 1906 Julia Wolfe bought a boarding house named \\"Old Kentucky Home\\" at nearby 48 Spruce Street in Asheville, taking up residence there with her youngest son while the rest of the family remained at the Woodfin Street residence. Wolfe lived in the boarding house on Spruce Street until he went to college in 1916. It is now the Thomas Wolfe Memorial.Thomas Wolfe‚Äôs ‚ÄòAngel‚Äô of Death , New York Times blog - May 1, 2009 Wolfe was closest to his brother Ben, whose early death at age 26 is chronicled in Look Homeward, Angel. Julia Wolfe bought and sold many properties, eventually becoming a successful real estate speculator. Wolfe began to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) when he was 15 years old. A member of the Dialectic Society and Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, he predicted that his portrait would one day hang in New West near that of celebrated North Carolina governor Zebulon Vance, which it does today. Aspiring to be a playwright, in 1919 Wolfe enrolled in a playwriting course. His one-act play, The Return of Buck Gavin, was performed by the newly formed Carolina Playmakers, then composed of classmates in Frederick Koch's playwriting class, with Wolfe acting the title role. He edited UNC's student newspaper The Daily Tar Heel and won the Worth Prize for Philosophy for an essay titled The Crisis in Industry. Another of his plays, The Third Night, was performed by the Playmakers in December 1919. Wolfe was inducted into the Golden Fleece honor society. Wolfe graduated from UNC with a B.A. in June 1920, and in September entered Harvard University, where he studied playwriting under George Pierce Baker. Two versions of his play The Mountains were performed by Baker's 47 Workshop in 1921. In 1922, Wolfe received his master's degree from Harvard. His father died in Asheville in June of that year. Wolfe studied another year with Baker, and the 47 Workshop produced his 10-scene play Welcome to Our City in May 1923. Wolfe visited New York City again in November 1923 and solicited funds for UNC, while trying to sell his plays to Broadway. In February 1924, he began teaching English as an instructor at New York University (NYU), a position he occupied periodically for almost seven years. Career Wolfe was unable to sell any of his plays after three years because of their great length. The Theatre Guild came close to producing Welcome to Our City before ultimately rejecting it, and Wolfe found his writing style more suited to fiction than the stage. He sailed to Europe in October 1924 to continue writing. From England he traveled to France, Italy and Switzerland. On his return voyage in 1925, he met Aline Bernstein (1880‚Äì1955), a scene designer for the Theatre Guild. Twenty years his senior, she was married to a successful stockbroker with whom she had two children. In October 1925, she and Wolfe became lovers and remained so for five years. Their affair was turbulent and sometimes combative, but she exerted a powerful influence, encouraging and funding his writing. Wolfe returned to Europe in the summer of 1926 and began writing the first version of an autobiographical novel titled O Lost. The narrative, which evolved into Look Homeward, Angel, fictionalized his early experiences in Asheville, and chronicled family, friends, and the boarders at his mother's establishment on Spruce Street. In the book, he renamed the town Altamont and called the boarding house \\"Dixieland\\". His family's surname became Gant, and Wolfe called himself Eugene, his father Oliver, and his mother Eliza. The original manuscript of O Lost was over 1,100 pages (333,000 words) long, and considerably more experimental in style than the final version of Look Homeward, Angel. It was submitted to Scribner's, where the editing was done by Maxwell Perkins, the most prominent book editor of the time, who also worked with Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. He cut the book to focus more on the character of Eugene, a stand-in for Wolfe. Wolfe initially expressed gratitude to Perkins for his disciplined editing, but he had misgivings later. It has been said that Wolfe found a father figure in Perkins, and that Perkins, who had five daughters, found in Wolfe a sort of foster son. The novel, which had been dedicated to Bernstein, was published 11 days before the stock market crash of 1929. Soon afterward, Wolfe returned to Europe and ended his affair with Bernstein. The novel caused a stir in Asheville, with its over 200 thinly disguised local characters.Horace Kephart and Thomas Wolfe's \\"abomination,\\" Look Homeward, Angel, Thomas Wolfe Review - 2006Margaret E. Roberts (Mrs. John Munsey Roberts), Buncombe County Library Wolfe chose to stay away from Asheville for eight years because of the uproar; he traveled to Europe for a year on a Guggenheim Fellowship. Look Homeward, Angel was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and Germany. Some members of Wolfe's family were upset with their portrayal in the book, but his sister Mabel wrote to him that she was sure he had the best of intentions. After four more years writing in Brooklyn, the second novel Wolfe submitted to Scribner's was The October Fair, a multi-volume epic roughly the length of Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time. After considering the commercial possibilities of publishing the book in full, Perkins opted to cut it significantly and create a single volume. Titled Of Time and the River, it was more commercially successful than Look Homeward, Angel. In an ironic twist, the citizens of Asheville were more upset this time because they hadn't been included. The character of Esther Jack was based on Bernstein. In 1934, Maxim Lieber served as his literary agent. Wolfe was persuaded by Edward Aswell to leave Scribner's and sign with Harper & Brothers. By some accounts, Perkins' severe editing of Wolfe's work is what prompted him to leave. Others describe his growing resentment that some people attributed his success to Perkins' work as editor. In 1936, Bernard DeVoto, reviewing The Story of a Novel for Saturday Review, wrote that Look Homeward, Angel was \\"hacked and shaped and compressed into something resembling a novel by Mr. Perkins and the assembly-line at Scribners\\".David Donald, Look Homeward (1987), 376-7 Wolfe spent much time in Europe and was especially popular and at ease in Germany, where he made many friends. However, in 1936 he witnessed incidents of discrimination against Jews, which upset him and changed his mind about the political developments in the country. He returned to America and published a story based on his observations (\\"I Have a Thing to Tell You\\") in The New Republic. Following its publication, Wolfe's books were banned by the German government, and he was prohibited from traveling there. In 1937, Chickamauga, his short story set during the American Civil War battle of the same name, was published. Wolfe returned to Asheville in early 1937 for the first time since publication of his first book. Death In 1938, after submitting over one million words of manuscript to his new editor, Edward Aswell, Wolfe left New York for a tour of the Western United States. On the way, he stopped at Purdue University and gave a lecture, \\"Writing and Living\\", and then spent two weeks traveling through 11 national parks in the West, the only part of the country he had never visited. Wolfe wrote to Aswell that while he had focused on his family in his previous writing, he would now take a more global perspective. In July, Wolfe became ill with pneumonia while visiting Seattle, spending three weeks in the hospital there. His sister Mabel closed her boarding house in Washington, D.C., and went to Seattle to care for him. Complications arose, and Wolfe was eventually diagnosed with miliary tuberculosis. On September 6, he was sent to Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment by the most famous neurosurgeon in the country, Walter Dandy, but an operation revealed that the disease had overrun the entire right side of his brain. Without regaining consciousness, he died 18 days before his 38th birthday. A journal of his two-week trip through the national parks was found among his belongings. On his deathbed and shortly before lapsing into a coma Wolfe wrote a letter to Perkins: He acknowledged that Perkins had helped to realize his work and had made his labors possible. In closing he wrote: > I shall always think of you and feel about you the way it was that Fourth of > July day three years ago when you met me at the boat, and we went out on the > cafe on the river and had a drink and later went on top of the tall > building, and all the strangeness and the glory and the power of life and of > the city was below.North Carolina Office of Archives and History - A Brief > Biography of Thomas Wolfe Wolfe was buried in Riverside Cemetery in Asheville, North Carolina, beside his parents and siblings. After Wolfe's death, The New York Times wrote: \\"His was one of the most confident young voices in contemporary American literature, a vibrant, full-toned voice which it is hard to believe could be so suddenly stilled. The stamp of genius was upon him, though it was an undisciplined and unpredictable genius.... There was within him an unspent energy, an untiring force, an unappeasable hunger for life and for expression which might have carried him to the heights and might equally have torn him down.\\" Time wrote: \\"The death last week of Thomas Clayton Wolfe shocked critics with the realization that, of all American novelists of his generation, he was the one from whom most had been expected.\\" Posthumous works Wolfe saw less than half of his work published in his lifetime, there being much unpublished material remaining after his death. He was the first American writer to leave two complete, unpublished novels in the hands of his publisher at death. Two Wolfe novels, The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again, were edited posthumously by Edward Aswell of Harper & Brothers. The novels were \\"two of the longest one-volume novels ever written\\" (nearly 700 pages each). In these novels, Wolfe changed the name of his autobiographical character from Eugene Gant to George Webber. O Lost, the original \\"author's cut\\" of Look Homeward, Angel, was reconstructed by F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli and published in 2000 on the centennial of Wolfe's birth. Bruccoli said that while Perkins was a talented editor, Look Homeward, Angel is inferior to the complete work of O Lost and that the publication of the complete novel \\"marks nothing less than the restoration of a masterpiece to the literary canon\\". Critical reception Upon publication of Look Homeward, Angel, most reviewers responded favorably, including John Chamberlain, Carl Van Doren, and Stringfellow Barr. Margaret Wallace wrote sneeringly in The New York Times Book Review that Wolfe had produced \\"as interesting and powerful a book as has ever been made out of the drab circumstances of provincial American life\\". An anonymous review published in Scribner's magazine compared Wolfe to Walt Whitman, and many other reviewers and scholars have found similarities in their works since. When published in the UK in July 1930, the book received similar reviews. Richard Aldington wrote that the novel was \\"the product of an immense exuberance, organic in its form, kinetic, and drenched with the love of life... I rejoice over Mr. Wolfe\\". Both in his 1930 Nobel Prize for Literature acceptance speech and original press conference announcement, Sinclair Lewis, the first American to win the Nobel Prize for literature, said of Wolfe, \\"He may have a chance to be the greatest American writer.... In fact I don't see why he should not be one of the greatest world writers.\\" Upon publication of his second novel, Of Time and the River, most reviewers and the public remained supportive, though some critics found shortcomings while still hailing it for moments or aspects of greatness. The book was well received by the public and became his only American bestseller. The publication was viewed as \\"the literary event of 1935\\"; by comparison, the earlier attention given to Look Homeward, Angel was modest. Both The New York Times and New York Herald Tribune published enthusiastic front-page reviews. Clifton Fadiman wrote in The New Yorker that while he wasn't sure what he thought of the book, \\"for decades we have not had eloquence like his in American writing\\". Malcolm Cowley of The New Republic thought the book would be twice as good if half as long, but stated Wolfe was \\"the only contemporary writer who can be mentioned in the same breath as Dickens and Dostoevsky\\". Robert Penn Warren thought Wolfe produced some brilliant fragments from which \\"several fine novels might be written\\". He went on to say: \\"And meanwhile it may be well to recollect that Shakespeare merely wrote Hamlet; he was not Hamlet.\\" Warren also praised Wolfe in the same review, though, as did John Donald Wade in a separate review. While acclaimed during his lifetime as one of the most important American writers, comparable to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, or William Faulkner, Wolfe's reputation has been \\"all but destroyed\\" since his death, although The New York Times wrote in 2003 that Wolfe's reputation and related scholarship appeared to be on an \\"upswing\\". He is often left out of college courses and anthologies devoted to great writers. Faulkner and W. J. Cash listed Wolfe as the ablest writer of their generation, although Faulkner later qualified his praise. Despite his early admiration of Wolfe's work, Faulkner later decided that his novels were \\"like an elephant trying to do the hoochie-coochie\\". Ernest Hemingway's verdict was that Wolfe was \\"the over-bloated Li'l Abner of literature\\".Wetzsteon, Ross, \\"Republic of Dreams Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia 1910-1960, Simon & Schuster, 2003, p. 415 Legacy Southerner and Harvard historian David Herbert Donald's biography of Wolfe, Look Homeward, won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1988. Wolfe inspired the works of many other authors, including Betty Smith with A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, Robert Morgan, author of Gap Creek, and Prince of Tides author Pat Conroy, who has said, \\"My writing career began the instant I finished Look Homeward, Angel.\\" Jack Kerouac idolized Wolfe. Ray Bradbury was influenced by Wolfe, and included him as a character in his books. Earl Hamner, Jr., who went on to create the popular television series The Waltons, idolized Wolfe in his youth. Hunter S. Thompson credits Wolfe for his famous phrase \\"Fear and Loathing\\" (on page 62 of The Web and the Rock). In the film Genius‚Äîa biographical drama about Max Perkins released in the summer of 2016‚ÄîWolfe is portrayed by Academy Award‚Äìnominated actor Jude Law. Archives Two universities hold the primary archival collections of Thomas Wolfe materials in the United States: the Thomas Clayton Wolfe Papers at Harvard University's Houghton Library, which includes all of Wolfe's manuscripts, and the Thomas Wolfe Collections in the North Carolina Collection at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Each October, at the time of Wolfe's birthday, UNC- Chapel Hill presents the annual Thomas Wolfe Prize and Lecture to a contemporary writer, with past recipients including Roy Blount, Jr., Robert Morgan, and Pat Conroy. Tributes Return of an Angel, a play by Sandra Mason, explores the reactions of Wolfe's family and the citizens of his hometown of Asheville to the publication of Look Homeward, Angel. The play was staged several times near the Thomas Wolfe Memorial, in the month of October, to commemorate his birthday. Pack Memorial Library in Asheville hosts the Thomas Wolfe Collection which \\"honors Asheville's favorite son\\".Buncombe County Public Libraries The Western North Carolina Historical Association has presented the Thomas Wolfe Memorial Literary Award yearly since 1955 for a literary achievement of the previous year. The Thomas Wolfe Society celebrates Wolfe's writings and publishes an annual review about Wolfe's work. The United States Postal Service honored Wolfe with a postage stamp on the occasion of what would have been Wolfe's 100th birthday in 2000. Historic landmarks The \\"Old Kentucky Home\\" was donated by Wolfe's family as the Thomas Wolfe Memorial and has been open to visitors since the 1950s, owned by the state of North Carolina since 1976 and designated as a National Historic Landmark. Wolfe called it \\"Dixieland\\" in Look homeward, Angel. In 1998, 200 of the house's 800 original artifacts and the house's dining room were destroyed by a fire set by an arsonist during the Bele Chere street festival. The perpetrator remains unknown. After a $2.4 million restoration, the house was re-opened in 2003. A cabin built by Wolfe's friend Max Whitson in 1924 near Azalea Road was designated as a historic landmark by the Asheville City Council in 1982. Thomas Wolfe Cabin, as it is called, was where Wolfe spent the summer of 1937 in his last visit to the city. In a letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald, Wolfe said, \\"I am going into the woods. I am going to try to do the best, the most important piece of work I have ever done\\", referring to October Fair, which became The Web and the Rock and You Can't Go Home Again. He also wrote \\"The Party at Jack's\\" while at the cabin in the Oteen community. The city bought the property, including a larger house, from John Moyer in 2001. As of 2017, renovation is being considered and work has been done on the cabin. The Thomas Wolfe Society The Thomas Wolfe Society,Thomas Wolfe Society website established in the late 1970s, issues an annual publication of Wolfe-related materials, and its journal, The Thomas Wolfe Review features scholarly articles, belles lettres, and reviews. The Society also awards prizes for literary scholarship on Wolfe. Adaptations In 1958, Ketti Frings adapted Look Homeward, Angel into a play of the same name. It ran on Broadway for 564 performances at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, received six Tony Award nominations, and won the 1958 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Frings was named \\"Woman of the Year\\" by The Los Angeles Times in the same year. In 1972, it was presented as a television drama, as was Of Time and the River in a one-hour version. Wolfe's play Welcome to Our City was performed twice at Harvard during his graduate school years, in Zurich in German during the 1950s, and by the Mint Theater in New York City in 2000 in celebration of Wolfe's 100th birthday.[51] Wolfe's relationship with his editor, Maxwell Perkins was made into a movie titled Genius in 2016 in which Jude Law and Colin Firth played the roles of Wolfe and Perkins respectively.

Jacques Cujas (or Cujacius) (1522 ‚Äì 4 October 1590) was a French legal expert. He was prominent among the legal humanists or mos gallicus school, which sought to abandon the work of the medieval Commentators and concentrate on ascertaining the correct text and social context of the original works of Roman law. He was born at Toulouse, where his father, surnamed Cujaus, was a fuller. Having taught himself Latin and Greek, he studied law under Arnaud du Ferri√®r, then professor at Toulouse, and rapidly gained a great reputation as a lecturer on Justinian. In 1554 he was appointed professor of law at Cahors, and about a year after Michel de l'H√¥pital called him to Bourges. Fran√ßois Douaren (Franciscus Duarenus), who also held a professorship at Bourges, stirred up the students against the new professor, and Cujas was glad to accept an invitation he had received to the University of Valence. Recalled to Bourges at the death of Duaren in 1559, he remained there till 1567, when he returned to Valence. There he gained a European reputation, and collected students from all parts of the continent, among whom were Joseph Scaliger and Jacques Auguste de Thou. In 1573 King Charles IX of France appointed Cujas counsellor to the parlement of Grenoble, and in the following year a pension was bestowed on him by Henry III. Margaret of Savoy persuaded him to move to Turin; but after a few months (1575) he returned to his old place at Bourges. The religious wars drove him out. He was called by the king to Paris, and permission was granted him by the parlement to lecture on civil law in the university there. A year later, he finally took up residence at Bourges, where he remained till his death in 1590, in spite of a handsome offer made him by pope Gregory XIII in 1584 to attract him to Bologna. The life of Cujas was altogether that of a scholar and teacher. In the religious wars which filled all the thoughts of his contemporaries he steadily refused to take any part. Nihil hoc ad edictum praetoris, \\"this has nothing to do with the edict of the praetor,\\" was his usual answer to those who spoke to him on the subject. His surpassing merit as a jurisconsult consisted in the fact that he turned from the ignorant commentators on Roman law to the Roman law itself. He consulted a very large number of manuscripts, of which he had collected more than 500 in his own library; but, unfortunately, he left orders in his will that his library should be divided among a number of purchasers, and his collection was thus scattered, and in great part lost. His emendations, of which a large number were published under the title of Observationes et emendationes, were not confined to lawbooks, but extended to many of the Latin and Greek classical authors. In jurisprudence his study was far from being devoted solely to Justinian; he recovered and gave to the world a part of the Theodosian Code, with explanations; and he procured the manuscript of the Basilika. He also composed a commentary on the Consuetudines Feudorum, and on some books of the Decretals. In the Paratitla, or summaries which he made of the Digest, and particularly of the Code of Justinian, he condensed into short axioms the elementary principles of law, and gave definitions remarkable for their admirable clearness and precision. His lessons, which he never dictated, were continuous discourses, for which he made no other preparation than that of profound meditation on the subjects to be discussed. He was impatient of interruptions and upon the least noise he would instantly quit the chair and retire. He was strongly attached to his pupils, and Joseph Justus Scaliger affirms that he lost more than 4000 livres by lending money to the more needy of them. Fabrot, however, collected the complete works of Cujas in the edition which he published at Paris (1658), Naples and Venice.

He makes fun of intelligence services, especially the British MI6, and their willingness to believe reports from their local informants. The book predates the Cuban Missile Crisis, but certain aspects of the plot, notably the role of missile installations, appear to anticipate the events of 1962. It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1959, directed by Carol Reed and starring Alec Guinness. In 1963 it was adapted into an opera by Malcolm Williamson, to a libretto by Sidney Gilliat, who had worked on the film. In 2007, it was adapted into a play by Clive Francis, which has since toured the UK several times and been performed in various parts of the world.  Background  Greene joined MI6 in August 1941.Christopher Hawtree. \\"A Muse on the tides of history: Elisabeth Dennys\\". The Guardian, 10 February 1999. Retrieved 16 April 2011. In London, Greene had been appointed to the subsection dealing with counter-espionage in the Iberian Peninsula, where he had learned about German agents in Portugal sending the Germans fictitious reports, which garnered them expenses and bonuses to add to their basic salary.Peter Hulme, University of Essex: Graham Greene And Cuba: Our Man in Havana? An analysis. Retrieved 31 August 2011 One of the agents was \\"Garbo\\", a Spanish double agent in Lisbon, who gave his German handlers disinformation, by pretending to control a ring of agents all over England. In fact, he invented armed forces movements and operations from maps, guides and standard military references. Garbo was the main inspiration for Wormold, the protagonist of Our Man In Havana.Smyth, Denis, \\"Our Man in Havana, Their Man in Madrid: Literary Invention in Espionage Fact and Fiction\\", Spy Fiction, Spy Films and Real Intelligence, (Wesley K. Wark, ed.), London: Frank Cass, 1991, pp. 117‚Äì135. Remembering the German agents in Portugal, Greene wrote the first version of the story in 1946, as an outline for a film script, with the story set in Estonia in 1938. The film was never made, and Greene soon realised that Havana, which he had visited several times in the early 1950s, would be a much better setting, with the absurdities of the Cold War being more appropriate for a comedy.  Plot  The novel, a black comedy, is set in Havana during the Fulgencio Batista regime. James Wormold, a vacuum cleaner retailer, is approached by Hawthorne, who tries to recruit him for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). Wormold's wife had left him and now, he lives with his beautiful 16-year-old daughter, Milly, who is devoutly Catholic, but also materialistic and manipulative. Since Wormold does not make enough money to pay for Milly's extravagances, he accepts the offer of a side job in espionage. Because he has no information to send to London, Wormold fabricates his reports using information found in newspapers and invents a fictitious network of agents. Some of the names in his network are those of real people (most of whom he has never met), but some are made up. Wormold tells only his friend and World War I veteran, Dr. Hasselbacher, about his spy work, hiding the truth from Milly. At one point, he decides to make his reports \\"exciting\\" by sending to London sketches of what he describes as a secret military installation in the mountains, actually vacuum cleaner parts scaled to a large size. In London, nobody except Hawthorne, the only one to know that Wormold sells vacuum cleaners, doubts this report. However, Hawthorne keeps quiet for fear of losing his job. In the light of the new developments, London sends Wormold a secretary, Beatrice Severn, and a radio assistant codenamed \\"C\\" with much spy paraphernalia. On arriving, Beatrice tells Wormold she has orders to take over his contacts. Her first request is to contact the pilot Ra√∫l. Under pressure, Wormold develops an elaborate plan for his fictitious agent \\"Ra√∫l\\". However, to his surprise, a real person with the same name is killed in an apparent car accident. From then on, Wormold's manufactured universe overlaps with reality, with threats made to his \\"contacts\\". Together, Beatrice, who still believes the contacts to be real, and Wormold try to save the real people who share names with his fictional agents. Meanwhile, London passes on the information that an unspecified enemy, implied to be a Soviet contact, intends to poison Wormold at a trade association luncheon, where he is the speaker. It would seem that his information has worried local operatives who now seek to remove him. London is pleased by this, as that validates his work. Wormold goes to the function and sees Dr. Hasselbacher, who loudly warns him of the threat. Wormold continues to dinner where he manages to refuse the meal that is offered and eats another one. Across the table sits a fellow vacuum cleaner salesman he had met earlier, Carter, who offers him whisky. Suspicious, Wormold knocks over the glass, which is then drunk by the headwaiter's dachshund, which soon dies. In retaliation for the failure, Carter kills Dr. Hasselbacher at the club bar. Captain Segura, a military strongman in love with Milly and intending to marry her, has a list of all of the spies in Havana, which Wormold would like to send to London to partially redeem his employment. He tells Segura that he is going to his house to discuss Segura's plans about Milly. Once there, Wormold proposes they play a game of draughts using miniature bottles of Scotch and bourbon as the game pieces, where each piece taken has to be drunk at once. Eventually, Segura, who is a much better player, ends up drunk and falls asleep. Wormold takes his gun and photographs the list using a microdot camera. To avenge the murder of Dr. Hasselbacher, Wormold convinces Carter to accompany him on a drive and, at a local brothel and after some hesitation, shoots him with Segura's pistol. He misses Carter and is about to leave. Carter shoots back, but Wormold shoots and kills him. Wormold sends the agent list as a microdot photograph on a postage stamp to London, but it proves blank when processed. Wormold confesses everything to Beatrice, who surprisingly admire his doings. Captain Segura then deport Wormold from Cuba by reporting him to London. Wormold and Beatrice are summoned to headquarters, where Beatrice is posted to Jakarta and Wormold's situation is considered. To avoid embarrassment and silence him from speaking to the press, MI6 offers Wormold a teaching post at headquarters and recommends him for the Order of the British Empire. Afterwards, Beatrice comes to Wormold's hotel, and they decide to marry. Milly is surprisingly accepting of their decision, and she is to go to a Swiss finishing school, paid for by Wormold's scam earnings.  Cuba's attitude  The revolutionary government of Cuba allowed the film version of Our Man in Havana to be filmed in the Cuban capital, but Fidel Castro complained that the novel did not accurately portray the brutality of the Batista regime. In his autobiography, Ways of Escape, Greene commented: > Alas, the book did me little good with the new rulers in Havana. In poking > fun at the British Secret Service, I had minimized the terror of Batista's > rule. I had not wanted too black a background for a light-hearted comedy, > but those who suffered during the years of dictatorship could hardly be > expected to appreciate that my real subject was the absurdity of the British > agent and not the justice of a revolution.Graham Greene, Ways of Escape: An > Autobiography (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1980), 257.

At these festivals, several colles castelleres (teams that build towers) attempt to build and dismantle a tower's structure. On November 16, 2010, castells were declared by UNESCO to be amongst the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.BBC, Close-Up: Catalonia's human towers Origin Although based on the earlier traditional Muixeranga of Algemes√≠ in Valencia, the tradition of castells within Catalonia originated in the Ball dels Valencians (Valencian Dance) in Valls, near the city of Tarragona, first documented in 1712. Over the course of the 18th century, they spread to other towns and cities in the area, including Vilafranca del Pened√®s and Tarragona, though it was not until the last 50 years that the practice of building castells began to spread to the rest of Catalonia. Interest in castells began to grow in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1980s, the inclusion of women in the formerly male-only discipline ushered in the second √®poca d'or (golden age) of castells; the presence of women is credited with allowing castells to be built lighter and stronger, permitting the construction of previously undreamed-of 9- and 10-story castells. While in Catalonia, the Ball dels Valencians began to focus more on the acrobatic nature of building ever taller human towers, their more religious and allegorical predecessors retain their traditions: the Muixeranga, which is performed in the Valencian city of Algemes√≠, and in other places in the Valencian Land and Catalonia, where it is often called the moixiganga. In 2015 the Coordinadora de Colles Castelleres de Catalunya hosted 99 groups, including Castellers de Vilafranca and Minyons de Terrassa, who were able to construct the tallest human tower to date, the \\"4 de 10\\" (10 levels of people with four in each level). These icons of Catalan culture and sports were featured in the opening ceremonies of the Barcelona 1992 Summer Olympics. The Castell In Catalan, the word castell literally translates into castle, however in English its meaning is a human tower. A castell is considered a success when assembly and disassembly can be done in complete succession. The assembly is complete once all castellers have climbed into their designated places, and the enxaneta climbs into place at the top and raises one open hand. The enxaneta then climbs down the other side of the castell, after which the remaining levels of castellers descend in highest to lowest order until all have reached safety. Aside from the people who climb to form the upper parts of the tower, others are needed to form the pinya, or bottom base of the castell, to sustain its weight. Members of the pinya (most often men) also act as a 'safety net' if the tower structure collapses, cushioning the fall of people from the upper levels. It is not uncommon‚Äîwhen not in competitions‚Äîfor other colles to assist in the pinya when a small colla is attempting a specially demanding structure in terms of people needed. The castell is built in two phases. First, the pinya‚Äî the base of the tower ‚Äî is formed. People forming higher levels of the tower move to a position from which they can easily get to their places in the tower. This is done slowly and carefully, and as subsequent base levels are completed the castellers in the pinya determine if their base is solid enough for construction to continue. Then, when the signal to proceed is given, bands begin to play the traditional Toc de Castells music as a hush comes over spectators of the event. The upper layers of the tower are built as quickly as possible in order to put minimal strain on the lower castellers, who bear most of the weight of the castell. The disassembly of the castell, done amidst the cheering of the crowd, is often the most treacherous stage of the event. A 'rising' castell consists of successive layers added from the bottom by lifting the castell into the air, stage by stage and is regarded as taking a great deal of practice, skill, and strength. Attire Three castellers in Reus wearing traditional uniforms with white pants and a sash used as a support and handhold.Typically castellers wear white trousers, a black sash (faixa), a bandana (mocador), and a shirt in a color characteristic of a given colla, often bearing the team's emblem. For instance, Castellers de Barcelona team wear red shirts while Castellers de Vilafranca wear green shirts and are often called \\"els verds\\" referencing their uniform.Bencomo, Aida Ribot, Castells in The Construction of a Catalan Community: Body, Language, and Identity amidst Catalonia's National Debate. University of California San Diego. 2020. The sash (faixa) is the most important part of their outfit, partially for its practical usage, but also a piece of clothing that represents the tradition as a whole. One only puts on a faixa when being a casteller. The sash is believed to support the lower back and it is further used by other castellers in the team as a foothold or handhold when climbing up the tower. This tasselled piece of cloth varies in length and width and depends on the casteller's position inside the tower and also on choice. The length of the sash ranges from 1.5 to 12m and usually is shorter for those higher up in the castell. Performing castellers usually go barefoot as to minimise injuries upon each other as they climb to their positions and also for sensitivity when balancing and to have better feel and hold each other. Structure The arrangement of castellers can be into a multi-tiered structure and the highest has a height spanning of nine or ten people from ground up. The motto of Castellers is \\"For√ßa, equilibri, valor i seny\\" (Strength, balance, courage and common sense). This motto is taken from a verse of Els Xiquets de Valls by Josep Anselm Clav√©, a Catalonian politician and composer.Miralles, Eloi. Fem Pinya! Els castells, s√≠mbol i expressi√≥ del nostre poble. Barcelona: Di√†fora, 1981.ISBN 84-85205-37-5. * Strength: Castellers at the base of the tower are usually stocky, while those further up, though generally lighter and agile, must still be fairly strong. The first castellers were peasants that were accustomed to holding great weights and were under much physical exertion. * Balance: Supporting those above themselves in the castell, whilst relying on those below for support, requires a strong sense of balance and trust. * Courage: The most important characteristic for castellers, especially for young children forming the highest levels of the castell. * Common sense: Rehearsing and performing requires a great deal of planning and reasoning. Any error can cause the structure to fail and break apart. Safety Accidents are rare during the construction of a castell; however, as in every other crowded cultural event, ambulances are stationed nearby in case a person needs immediate attention. Fatal accidents do occur; the most recent was on September 15, 2011 when a man broke his second cervical vertebrae after falling from a castell. On July 23, 2006, in Matar√≥, a young casteller fell off the formation of a castell and died. This led to the requirement of specially designed helmets for all children participating in castells. Prior to this, the last death of a participant was in 1983 in Torredembarra. There have only ever been four recorded mortalities from participating in castells. Since the introduction of the helmets, there have been no cases of traumatic brain injury among children participating in castells. Terminology=Castell nomenclature= Castellers monument in Tarragona. Castells are primarily described by the number of people in each level of the tronc and the total number of levels and, where applicable, any special construction technique used. Levels are composed of between one and five individuals standing on the shoulders of the level below. Common terms indicating the number of people for each level of a tower: * Pilar (\\"pillar\\"): one person per level * Torre (\\"tower\\"): two people per level * Tres : three people per level * Quatre : four people per level * Cinc : five people per level (and so on) Castells with more than four people per level are composite structures. For example, the levels of a cinc are not pentagons; instead, the cinc amounts to a tres and a torre fused together (3 + 2 = 5), each level forming a figure- eight shape if seen from above. Numbers of levels most commonly built: * Sis : six levels high * Set : seven levels * Vuit : eight levels * Nou : nine levels * Deu : ten levels For example, a tres de vuit (abbreviated 3d8) denotes a tower with three people per level and eight levels. (In fact, only the first five levels will have three people per level. The pom de dalt‚Äîsee below‚Äîis reckoned as making up the top three levels.) Very high towers and ones with a small number of people on each level normally need extra support from the base or bottom levels. These base levels are frequently indicated as part of the name of the tower. Three kinds of base levels are most commonly used: * Pinya (\\"pine cone/bulk\\"): the ground-level base, often composed of several hundred people. Most towers have this, so it is not mentioned in the name. Instead, when a tower is built without a pinya, it is described as net (\\"neat\\" or \\"simple\\"). There is furthermore an expression in Catalan called \\"fer pinya\\" which is taken from its usage in castells. Literally translating into \\"making a pinecone\\" in English, this phrase is not only meaningful for castellers but for the people of Catalonia as a whole. To be a part of a pinya you do not need to be an experienced casteller, anybody can be a part of the base. Thus, \\"fer pinya\\" represents the idea of coming together in solidarity to accomplish a goal or task. * Folre (\\"cover\\"/\\"lining\\"): a second-level base built on top of the pinya. Another layer of reinforcement above the pinya for the castell. It is always mentioned when used. * Manilles (\\"handles\\"/\\"handcuffs\\"): a third- level base built on top of the second-level folre. A manille is often use for particularly tall castells (nine or ten levels). It is always mentioned when used. * When tall castells are built, for extra challenge, without a folre and/or manilles that would usually be used due to their height, this is also mentioned, e.g. torre de 9 sense manilles (torre of 9 without manilles), which can also be called torre de 9 amb folre (torre of 9 with folre, i.e. with only a folre and no manilles) The term amb l'agulla (\\"with the needle\\") refers to a high column of one person per level which is built inside the main tower. When the castell is being dismantled, the agulla must remain standing until the outside part of the castell is already down. Terms denoting special construction techniques include: *aixecat per sota (\\"raised from below\\"), in which the castell is built not from the bottom up by climbing, but from the top down with each successive level being boosted onto the shoulders of castellers who join at ground level; *caminant (\\"walking\\"), in which a castell (usually a pilar), and its pinya if any, slowly walk as a unit across the ground. This is often done to enter the site at the beginning of an actuaci√≥. Another aspect of castell nomenclature refers to how successfully the tower was completed. Four terms are used: * Descarregat : the tower is completed to the top‚Äîthat is, to the point where the enxaneta raises his or her hand in the aleta gesture‚Äîand successfully dismantled * Carregat : the tower is completed to the top but falls during dismantling * Intent : the tower falls before it is completed to the top * Intent desmuntat : the tower is not completed to the top but is successfully dismantled (because the tower is observed to be unstable and likely to fall) =Examples= * Pilar de sis: one person per level in a tower of six levels. If nothing else is mentioned, this means that the tower had the bottom base-level pinya (as always) and was successfully dismantled (descarregat). * Torre de nou: two people per level in a tower of nine stories. * Cinc de nou amb folre: five people at each level in a tower of nine levels, with a second-level folre built on top of the base-level pinya. * Quatre de nou amb agulla: four people at each level in a tower of nine levels, with an interior agulla. * Quatre de nou net://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujRmC0nJDjg:four people at each level in a tower of nine levels without folre ( a second-level base ) built on top of the pinya ( ground level base ). * Tres de deu amb folre i manilles: three people per level in a tower of ten levels, with a second-level folre and a third-level manilles. * Quatre de deu amb folre i manilles: four people per level, with additional support in the second and third levels. This difficult construction was achieved for the first time ever in November 2015, by the Minyons de Terrassa team. =Castellers and parts of a castell= * cap de colla (\\"team leader\\"): The head of each team, who decides which castells the team is ready to attempt and directs the construction of the castells from the ground. The cap de colla is always accompanied by a number of assistants and advisers. * cap de pinya (\\"base leader\\") one of the team leaders's assistants, who takes particular responsibility for the allocation of places in the pinya, ensuring even force is applied to the base of the castell. The cap de pinya will direct members of the pinya to different positions, depending on the size of the castell. * tronc (\\"trunk\\"): The vertical part of the castell. * baix (\\"base\\"): the casteller standing on the ground at the bottom of one of the columns of castellers making up the tronc, and supporting the segon on his or her shoulders. Short, stocky, and strong. * segon (\\"second\\"): One of the castellers standing on the shoulders of the baixos, making up the second storey of the tronc. Likewise, the subsequent storeys of the trunk are called ter√ßos, quarts, quints, sisens, and setens (\\"thirds, fourths, fifths, sixths, sevenths\\"). As the pom de dalt makes up the top three storeys of the castell and there has never yet been a castell taller than ten storeys, there have never been any vuitens (\\"eighths\\"). * agulla (\\"needle,\\" not to be confused with the agulla mentioned above): A casteller who stands in front of and facing a baix, holding the lower legs of the segon and relaying information and instructions to the members of the pinya. * contrafort (\\"buttress\\"): stands behind the baix and holds embraces him/her for support. * crossa (\\"crutch\\"): fills in the space between baixos and supports their arms on his/her shoulders. Generally short and slender. * mans (\\"hands\\"): stands behind the contrafort and supports the buttocks of the segon. * vent (\\"wind\\"): stands between and just outside two baixos and supports the legs of the segons standing on both. * lateral: stands to one side of a baix and supports one leg of the segon from the side. * cord√≥ (\\"cordon\\"): Each concentric layer of the pinya. The ones in direct contact with the tronc are the primer cord√≥, those behind them are the segon cord√≥, and so forth. Members of the outer cordons are designated by the person they are positioned behind and the number of their cord√≥. For example, the person behind the primeres mans is the segones mans; behind that person is the terceres mans, and so forth. * tap (\\"stopper\\"): inserted into the pinya to fill a gap and make the pinya more solid. * pom de dalt (\\"top group\\"): The top three levels of the castell: dosos, aixecador, and enxaneta. * canalla (\\"children\\"): Those who make up the top levels of the castell. They are usually children but can also be women. * dosos (\\"the twos\\"): A level consisting of two people, supporting and locked together by the aixecador and surmounted by the enxaneta. These castellers are generally children. * aixecador (\\"riser\\") or acotxador (\\"croucher\\"): The person who squats with one foot on each of the dosos, locking them together and so providing a stable platform for the enxaneta, who stands astride the aixecador. Almost always a child. * enxaneta (\\"rider\\") : The topmost casteller, a child. When the enxaneta raises his or her hand in a four-finger gesture called the aleta, this indicates that the construction of the castell is complete.

Biography=Early years= S√©guier was born in Paris to a prominent legal family originating in Quercy. His grandfather, Pierre S√©guier (1504‚Äì1580), was pr√©sident √† mortier in the parliament of Paris from 1554 to 1576, and the chancellor's father, Jean S√©guier, a seigneur d'Autry, was civil lieutenant of Paris at the time of his death in 1596. Pierre was brought up by his uncle, Antoine S√©guier, president and mortier in the parlement, and became master of requests in 1620. From 1621 to 1624 he was intendant of Guyenne, where he became closely allied with the duc d'√âpernon. In 1624 he succeeded to his uncle's charge in the parlement, which he filled for nine years. =Career= In this capacity he showed great independence with regard to the royal authority; but when in 1633 he became keeper of the seals under Richelieu, he proceeded to bully and humiliate the parlement in his turn. He became allied with the cardinal's family by the marriage of his daughter Marie with Richelieu's nephew, Pierre C√©sar du Cambout, marquis de Coislin, and in December 1635 he became chancellor of France. In 1637 S√©guier was sent to examine the papers of the queen, Anne of Austria, at Val-de-Gr√¢ce. According to Anquetil, the chancellor saved her by warning her of the projected inquisition. In 1639 Seguier was sent to punish the Normans for the insurrection of the Nu-Pieds, the military chief of the expedition, Gassion, being placed under his orders. He put down pillage with a strong hand, and was sufficiently disinterested to refuse a gift of confiscated Norman lands. He was the submissive tool of Richelieu in the prosecutions of Cinq-Mars and Fran√ßois Auguste de Thou in 1642. His authority survived the changes following on the successive deaths of Richelieu and Louis XIII, and he was the faithful servant of Anne of Austria and of Mazarin. His resolute attitude towards the parlement of Paris made the chancellor one of the chief objects of the hatred of the Frondeurs. Pierre S√©guier entering Paris with Louis XIV of France in 1660, painted by Charles Le Brun, c. 1670. On 25 August 1648, S√©guier was sent to the parlement to regulate its proceedings. On the way he was assailed by rioters on the Pont-Neuf, and sought refuge in the house of Louis Charles d'Albert, duc de Luynes. In the course of the concessions made to the Fronde in 1650, S√©guier was dismissed from his office of keeper of the seals. He spent part of his retirement at Rosny, with his second daughter Charlotte and her husband, the duke of Sully. He was recalled in April 1651, but six months later, on the king's attaining his majority, S√©guier was again disgraced, and the seals were given to President Mathieu Mol√©, who held them with a short interval till his death in 1656, when they were returned to S√©guier. S√©guier lived for some time in extreme retirement in Paris, devoting himself to the affairs of the academy. When Paris was occupied by the princes in 1652, he was for a short time a member of their council, but he joined the king at Pontoise in August, and became president of the royal council. After Mazarin's death in 1661 S√©guier retained but a shadow of his former authority. He showed a great violence in his conduct of the case against Fouquet, voting for the death of the prisoner. In 1666 S√©guier was placed at the head of a commission called to simplify the police organization, especially that of Paris; and the consequent ordinances of 1667 and 1670 for the better administration of justice were drawn up by him. S√©guier died at Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1672. Culture S√©guier was a man of great learning, and throughout his life a patron of literature. In December 1642 he succeeded Richelieu as official \\"protector\\" of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, which from that time until his death held its sessions in his house. His library was one of the most valuable of his time, only second, perhaps, to the royal collection. It contained no less than 4000 manuscripts in various languages, the most important section of them being the Greek manuscripts. A catalogue was drawn up in Latin and in French (1685‚Äì1686) by the duc de Coislin. The chancellor's great-grandson, Henri Charles du Cambout de Coislin, bishop of Metz, commissioned Bernard de Montfaucon, a Benedictine of the Congregation of St Maur, to prepare a catalogue of the Greek manuscripts. with commentaries. This work was published in folio 1715, as Bibliotheca Coisliniana, olim Segueriana.... The greater part of the printed books were destroyed by fire, in the abbey of St Germain-des-Pr√©s, in 1794. S√©guier is a minor character in The Three Musketeers.

Biography The son of Edouard Mol√© (d. 1614), who was for a time procureur-g√©n√©ral, he was educated at the University of Orl√©ans. Admitted conseiller in 1606, he was pr√©sident aux requ√™tes in 1610, procureur-g√©n√©ral in succession to Nicolas de Belli√®vre in 1614, and took part in the assembly of the Notables summoned at Rouen in 1617. He fought in vain against the setting up of special tribunals, or commissions, to try prisoners charged with political offences, and for his persistence in the case of the brothers Louis and Michel de Marillac he was suspended in 1631, and ordered to appear at Fontainebleau in his own defence. Hitherto Mol√©'s relations with Cardinal Richelieu had been fairly good, but his inclination to the doctrines of Port Royal increased the differences between them. It was not until after Richelieu's death that he was able to secure the release of his friend, the abb√© de St Cyran. In 1641 he was appointed first president of the parlement, with the preliminary condition that he should not permit the general assembly of the chambers except by express order of the king. After Richelieu's death the pretensions of the parlement increased; the hereditary magistrature arrogated to itself the functions of the states-general, and in 1648 the parlement with the other sovereign courts (the cour des aides, the grand conseil, and the cour des comptes) met in one assembly and proposed for the royal sanction twenty-seven articles, which amounted in substance to a new constitution. In the long conflict between Anne of Austria and the parlement, Mol√©, without yielding the rights of the parlement, played a conciliatory part. In the popular tumult known as the day of the barricades (26 August 1648) he sought out Mazarin and the queen to demand the release of Pierre Broussel and his colleagues, whose seizure had been the original cause of the outbreak. Next day the parlement marched in procession to repeat Mol√©'s demand. On their way back they were stopped by the crowd. Mol√© was threatened with death unless he brought back Broussel or Mazarin as a hostage. Many magistrates fled; the remnant, headed by the intrepid Mol√©, returned to the Palais Royal, where Anne of Austria was induced to release the prisoners. Mol√©'s moderating counsels failed to prevent the outbreak of the first Fronde, but he negotiated the peace of Rueil in 1651, and averted a conflict between the partisans of Cond√© and of the Cardinal de Retz within the precincts of the Palais de Justice. He refused honours and rewards for himself or his family, but became keeper of the seals, in which capacity he was compelled to follow the court, and he therefore retired from the presidency of the parlement. The M√©moires of Mol√© were edited for the Soci√©t√© de l'histoire de France (4 vols., 1855) by Aim√© Champollion-Figeac, and his life was written by Baron AGP de Barante in Le Parlement et la Fronde (1859).

The best-known member of this language family, Mongolian, is the primary language of most of the residents of Mongolia and the Mongol residents of Inner Mongolia, with an estimated 5.7+ million speakers. The closest relatives of the Mongolic languages appear to be the extinct Khitan and Tuyuhun languages. Some linguists have grouped Mongolic with Turkic, Tungusic and possibly Koreanic and Japonic as part of the widely discredited Altaic family.e.g. ; contra e.g. Classification The stages of Historical Mongolic are: * Pre- Proto-Mongolic, from approximately the 4th century AD until the 12th century AD, influenced by Common Turkic, and previously by Bulgar Turkic. *Proto- Mongolic, from approximately the 13th century AD, spoken around the time of Chinggis Khan. * Middle Mongol (depending on classification spoken from the 13th century until the early 15th century or late 16th century; given the almost entire lack of written sources for the period in between, an exact cutoff point cannot be established) *Classical Mongolian, from approximately 1700 to 1900 * Standard Mongolian The standard Mongolian language has been in official use since 1919, and this form of the language is used in the economic, political, and social fields.The script for standard Mongolian uses a version of the Russian alphabet called the Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet. It was introduced in the 1940s in the Mongolian People's Republic under Soviet influence, after a brief period where Latin was used as the official script. After the Mongolian democratic revolution in 1990, the traditional Mongolian script was considered to replace Cyrillic, but this plan was not adopted. Contemporary Mongolic languages are classified as follows. ;Mongolic * Dagur (96,000 speakers) * Central Mongolic **Khamnigan (2,000 speakers) ** Buryat (330,000 speakers) ** Mongolian proper (5.2 million speakers) ** Eastern and Central dialect ***Khalkha *** Chakhar *** Khorchin ** Ordos (123,000 speakers) ** Oirat (including Kalmyk) (360,000 speakers) *Southern Mongolic (part of a Gansu‚ÄìQinghai Sprachbund) **Shira Yugur (4,000 speakers) ** Shirongolic *** Monguor (150,000 speakers) *** Bonan (6,000 speakers) *** Santa (Dongxiang) (200,000 speakers) *** Kangjia (1,000 speakers) * Moghol (200 speakers) Alexander Vovin (2007) identifies the extinct TabŒ≥aƒç or Tuoba language as a Mongolic language.Vovin, Alexander. 2007. ‚ÄòOnce again on the TabŒ≥aƒç language.‚Äô Mongolian Studies XXIX: 191-206. However, Chen (2005)Chen, Sanping 2005. Turkic or Proto-Mongolian? A Note on the Tuoba Language. Central Asiatic Journal 49.2: 161-73. argues that Tuoba (TabŒ≥aƒç) was a Turkic language. Vovin (2018) suggests that the Ruanruan language of the Rouran Khaganate was a Mongolic language, close but not identical to Middle Mongolian. The classification and numbers of speakers above follow Janhunen (2006) except for Southern Mongolic, which follows Nugteren (2011). In another classificational approach,e.g. SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. (2005:193‚Äì194) there is a tendency to call Central Mongolian a language consisting of Mongolian proper, Oirat and Buryat, while Ordos (and implicitly also Khamnigan) is seen as a variety of Mongolian proper. Within Mongolian proper, they then draw a distinction between Khalkha on the one hand and Southern Mongolian (containing everything else) on the other hand. A less common subdivision of Central Mongolic is to divide it into a Central dialect (Khalkha, Chakhar, Ordos), an Eastern dialect (Kharchin, Khorchin), a Western dialect (Oirat, Kalmyk), and a Northern dialect (consisting of two Buryat varieties). quoted from SeƒçenbaŒ≥atur et al. (2005:167‚Äì168) The broader delimitation of Mongolian may be based on mutual intelligibility, but an analysis based on a tree diagram such as the one above faces other problems because of the close contacts between, for example, Buryat and Khalkha Mongols during history, thus creating or preserving a dialect continuum. Another problem lies in the sheer comparability of terminology, as Western linguists use language and dialect, while Mongolian linguists use the Grimmian trichotomy language (kele), dialect (nutuŒ≥-un ayalŒ≥u) and Mundart (aman ayalŒ≥u). Rybatzki (2003: 388-389)Rybatzki, Volker. 2003. \\"Intra-Mongolic taxonomy.\\" In Janhunen, Juha (ed). The Mongolic Languages, 364-390. Routledge Language Family Series 5. London: Routledge. recognizes the following 6 areal subgroups of Mongolic. *Northeastern Mongolic (NE) = Dagur *Northern Mongolic (N) = Khamnigan Mongol‚ÄìBuryat *Central Mongolic (C) = Mongol proper‚ÄìOrdos‚ÄìOirat *South-Central Mongolic (SC) = Shira Yughur *Southeastern Mongolic (SE) = Mongghul‚ÄìMangghuer‚ÄìBonan‚ÄìSanta - Kangjia *Southwestern Mongolic (SW) = Moghol =Mixed languages= The following are mixed Sinitic‚ÄìMongolic languages. *Tangwang (mixed Mandarin‚ÄìSanta) *Wutun (mixed Mandarin‚ÄìBonan) Pre-Proto-Mongolic Pre-Proto-Mongolic's position on the chronological tree of Mongolic language Pre-Proto-Mongolic is the name for the stage of Mongolic that precedes Proto-Mongolic. Proto-Mongolic can be clearly identified chronologically with the language spoken by the Mongols during Genghis Khan's early expansion in the 1200-1210s. Pre-Proto-Mongolic, by contrast, is a continuum that stretches back indefinitely in time. It is divided into Early Pre-Proto-Mongolic and Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic. Late Pre- Proto-Mongolic refers to the Mongolic spoken a few centuries before Proto- Mongolic by the Mongols and neighboring tribes like the Merkits and Keraits. Certain archaic words and features in Written Mongol go back past Proto- Mongolic to Late Pre-Proto-Mongolic (Janhunen 2006). =Relationship with Turkic= Pre-Proto-Mongolic has borrowed various words from Turkic languages. In the case of Early Pre-Proto-Mongolic, certain loanwords in the Mongolic languages point to early contact with Oghur (Pre-Proto-Bulgaric) Turkic, also known as r-Turkic. These loanwords precede Common Turkic (z-Turkic) loanwords and include: *Mongolic ikere (twins) from Pre-Proto-Bulgaric ikir (versus Common Turkic ekiz) *Mongolic h√ºker (ox) from Pre-Proto-Bulgaric hek√ºr (Common Turkic √∂k√ºz) *Mongolic jer (weapon) from Pre-Proto-Bulgaric jer (Common Turkic y√§z) *Mongolic biragu (calf) versus Common Turkic buzagu *Mongolic siri- (to smelt ore) versus Common Turkic siz- (to melt) The above words are thought to have been borrowed from Oghur Turkic during the time of the Xiongnu. Later Turkic peoples in Mongolia all spoke forms of Common Turkic (z-Turkic) as opposed to Oghur (Bulgharic) Turkic, which withdrew to the west in the 4th century. The Chuvash language, spoken by 1 million people in European Russia, is the only living representative of Oghur Turkic which split from Common Turkic around the 1st century AD. Words in Mongolic like dayir (brown, Common Turkic yagiz) and nidurga (fist, Common Turkic yudruk) with initial *d and *n versus Common Turkic *y are sufficiently archaic to indicate loans from an earlier stage of Oghur (Pre-Proto-Bulgaric). This is because Chuvash and Common Turkic do not differ in these features despite differing fundamentally in rhotacism-lambdacism (Janhunen 2006). Oghur tribes lived in the Mongolian borderlands before the 5th century, and provided Oghur loanwords to Early Pre- Proto-Mongolic before Common Turkic loanwords. Proto-Mongolic Proto- Mongolic, the ancestor language of the modern Mongolic languages, is very close to Middle Mongol, the language spoken at the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongol Empire. Most features of modern Mongolic languages can thus be reconstructed from Middle Mongol. An exception would be the voice suffix like -caga- 'do together', which can be reconstructed from the modern languages but is not attested in Middle Mongol. The languages of the historical Donghu, Wuhuan, and Xianbei peoples might have been related to Proto-Mongolic., \\"[...] believed that at least some of their constituent tribes spoke a Mongolian language, though there is still some argument that a particular variety of Turkic may have been spoken among them.\\" For Tabghach, the language of the founders of the Northern Wei dynasty for which the surviving evidence is very sparse, and Khitan, for which evidence exists that is written in the two Khitan scripts (large and small) which have as yet not been fully deciphered, a direct affiliation to Mongolic can now be taken to be most likely or even demonstrated.see Vovin 2007 for Tabghach and Janhunen 2012 for Khitan  Juha Janhunen (2006) classified the Khitan language into the \\"Para-Mongolic\\" family, meaning that it is related to the Mongolic languages as a sister group, rather than as a direct descendant of Proto-Mongolic. Alexander Vovin (2017)Vovin, Alexander. (2017). Koreanic loanwords in Khitan and their importance in the decipherment of the latter. Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, 70(2), 207-215. has also identified several possible loanwords from Koreanic languages into the Khitan language. Vovin (2015) identified the extinct Tuyuhun language as yet another Para-Mongolic language.Vovin, Alexander. 2015. Some notes on the Tuyuhun (ÂêêË∞∑Ê∏æ) language: in the footsteps of Paul Pelliot.

He is a respected Baltimore forensic psychiatrist, as well as a cannibalistic serial killer. After he is caught and incarcerated for his crimes, he consults with the FBI to assist them in finding other serial killers. Lecter was introduced in the 1981 thriller novel Red Dragon. The novel and its 1988 sequel, The Silence of the Lambs, feature Lecter as one of the primary antagonists. In the third novel, Hannibal (1999), Lecter becomes a protagonist. His role as the antihero occurs in the fourth novel, Hannibal Rising (2006), which explores his childhood and development into a serial killer. The first film adapted from the Harris novels was Manhunter (1986, based on Red Dragon) which features Brian Cox as Lecter, spelled \\"Lecktor\\". Anthony Hopkins won an Academy Award for his portrayal of the character in The Silence of the Lambs (1991). He would reprise the role in Hannibal in 2001 and in a second adaptation of Red Dragon made in 2002 under the original title. The most recent film adapted from the Harris novels is Hannibal Rising (2007), in which Lecter is portrayed by Gaspard Ulliel. Harris himself wrote the screenplay for this film. The NBC television series Hannibal debuted in 2013, and focuses on the development of the relationship between Lecter and Will Graham, an FBI profiler. In the series, Lecter is portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, who won a Saturn Award for his performance. In 2003, Hannibal Lecter (as portrayed by Hopkins) was chosen by the American Film Institute as the greatest villain in American cinema. In June 2010, Entertainment Weekly named him one of the \\"100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years\\". In 2019, Lecter (as portrayed by Mikkelsen) was listed as the 18th greatest villain in television history by Rolling Stone. Character overview In the novel Red Dragon, protagonist Will Graham says that psychologists refer to Lecter as a sociopath \\"because they don't know what else to call him\\". Graham claims that \\"he has no remorse or guilt at all\\", and tortured animals as a child, but he does not exhibit any of the other criteria traditionally associated with sociopathy. Asked how he himself would describe Lecter, Graham responds, \\"he's a monster\\", implying that Lecter's mind is somehow \\"incomplete\\" in the same way that some babies are born with missing limbs or non-functioning organs. In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter's keeper, Dr. Frederick Chilton, claims that Lecter is a \\"pure sociopath\\" (\\"pure psychopath\\" in the film adaptation). In the film adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, protagonist Clarice Starling says of Lecter, \\"They don‚Äôt have a name for what he is.\\" Lecter's pathology is explored in greater detail in Hannibal and Hannibal Rising, which explains that he was traumatized as a child in Lithuania in 1944 when he witnessed the murder and cannibalism of his beloved sister, Mischa, by a group of deserting Lithuanian Hilfswillige, one of whom claimed that Lecter unwittingly ate his sister as well. All media in which Lecter appears portray him as intellectually brilliant, cultured and sophisticated, with refined tastes in art, music and cuisine. He is frequently depicted preparing gourmet meals from his victims' flesh, the most famous example being his admission that he once ate a census taker's liver \\"with some fava beans and a nice Chianti\\" (a \\"big Amarone\\" in the novel). He is deeply offended by rudeness, and frequently kills people who have bad manners. Prior to his capture and imprisonment, he was a member of Baltimore, Maryland's social elite, and a sitting member of the Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra's Board of Directors. In The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter is described through Starling's eyes: \\"She could see that he was small, sleek; in his hands and arms she saw wiry strength like her own.\\" The novel also reveals that Lecter's left hand has a rare condition called mid-ray duplication polydactyly, i.e. a duplicated middle finger. In Hannibal, he performs plastic surgery on his own face on several occasions, and removes his extra digit. Lecter's eyes are a shade of maroon, and reflect the light in \\"pinpoints of red\\". He has small white teeth and dark, slicked-back hair with a widow's peak. He also has a keen sense of smell; in Red Dragon, he immediately recognizes Will Graham's brand of aftershave, and in The Silence of the Lambs, he is able to identify through a plexiglass window with small holes the brand of perfume that Starling wore the day before. He has an eidetic memory with which he has constructed in his mind an elaborate \\"memory palace\\" with which he relives memories and sensations in rich detail. Anthony Hopkins, the actor most closely identified with the character, said on the commentary track to the DVD release of The Silence of the Lambs that his interpretation of Lecter was inspired by HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. In his \\"Great Movies\\" essay on Silence of the Lambs, Roger Ebert further elaborated on this comparison: \\"He is a dispassionate, brilliant machine, superb at logic, deficient in emotions.\\" In the same essay, Ebert theorized: > One key to the film's appeal is that audiences like Hannibal Lecter...He may > be a cannibal, but as a dinner party guest he would give value for money (if > he didn't eat you). He does not bore, he likes to amuse, he has his > standards, and he is the smartest person in the movie...He bears comparison, > indeed, with such other movie monsters as Nosferatu, Frankenstein...King > Kong and Norman Bates. They have two things in common: They behave according > to their natures, and they are misunderstood.

Realizing that Graham is on to him, Lecter creeps up behind Graham and stabs him with a linoleum knife, nearly disemboweling him. Graham survives, but is so traumatized by the incident that he takes early retirement from the FBI. Lecter is charged with a series of nine murders, but is found not guilty by reason of insanity. He is institutionalized in the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane under the care of Dr. Frederick Chilton, a pompous, incompetent psychologist whom he despises, and who subjects him to a series of petty cruelties. Some years later, Graham comes out of retirement and consults Lecter in order to catch another serial killer, Francis Dolarhyde, known by the nickname \\"the Tooth Fairy\\". Through the classifieds of a tabloid called The National Tattler, Lecter provides Dolarhyde with Graham's home address; Dolarhyde later uses this information to break into Graham‚Äôs home, stab him in the face, and threaten his family before Graham‚Äôs wife Molly shoots him dead. At the end of the novel, Lecter sends Graham a letter, saying that he hopes Graham \\"won‚Äôt be very ugly\\". The Silence of the Lambs In the 1988 sequel The Silence of the Lambs, Lecter assists FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling in catching a serial killer, Jame Gumb, known by the nickname \\"Buffalo Bill\\". Lecter is fascinated by Starling, and they form an unusual relationship in which he provides her with a profile of the killer and his modus operandi in exchange for details about her unhappy childhood. Lecter had previously met Gumb, the former lover of his patient (and eventual victim) Benjamin Raspail. He does not reveal this information directly, instead giving Starling vague clues to help her figure it out for herself. In return for Lecter's assistance, the FBI and Chilton arrange for him to be transferred to a lower security facility, far away from Chilton. Lecter escapes while in transit, however, killing and mutilating his guards and using one of their faces as a mask to fool police and paramedics before killing the latter and escaping. While in hiding, he writes one letter to Starling wishing her well, a second to Barney (his primary orderly at the asylum), thanking him for his courteous treatment, and a third to Chilton, promising gruesome revenge; Chilton disappears soon afterward. Hannibal In the third novel, 1999's Hannibal, Lecter lives in a palazzo in Florence, Italy, and works as a museum curator under the alias \\"Dr. Fell\\". One of Lecter‚Äôs two surviving victims, Mason Verger - a wealthy, sadistic pedophile whom Lecter had brutalized during a court-ordered therapy session, leaving him a horrifically disfigured quadriplegic - offers a huge reward for anyone who apprehends Lecter, whom he intends to feed to wild boars specially bred for the purpose. Verger enlists the help of Rinaldo Pazzi, a disgraced Italian police inspector, and Paul Krendler, a corrupt Justice Department official and Starling's boss. Lecter kills Pazzi and returns to the United States to escape Verger's Sardinian henchmen, only to be captured. Starling follows them, intent on apprehending Lecter personally, and is injured in a gunfight with Verger's henchmen. Lecter escapes, thanks to Starling's help, and persuades Verger's younger sister Margot ‚Äì his former patient, whom Verger had molested and raped years earlier ‚Äì to kill her brother, promising to take the blame. Lecter rescues the wounded Starling and takes her to his rented house on the Chesapeake shore to treat her, subjecting her to a regimen of mind-altering drugs in the course of therapy sessions to help her heal from her childhood trauma and her pent-up anger at the injustices of the world. He considers whether his long-dead younger sister Mischa may somehow be able to live again through Starling. One day, he invites her to a formal dinner where the guest and first course is Krendler, whose brain they consume together. On this night, Starling refuses to let her personality be subsumed, telling Lecter that Mischa's memory can live within him. She then offers him her breast, and they become lovers. Three years later, former orderly Barney, who had treated Lecter with respect while he was incarcerated in Baltimore, sees Lecter and Starling entering the Teatro Col√≥n opera house in Buenos Aires. Fearing for his life, Barney leaves Buenos Aires immediately, never to return. The reader then learns that Lecter and Starling are living together in an \\"exquisite\\" Beaux Arts mansion, where they employ servants and engage in activities such as learning new languages and dancing together and building their own respective memory palaces, and is told that \\"Sex is a splendid structure they add to every day\\", that the mind-altering drugs \\"have had no part in their lives for a long time\\", and that Lecter is \\"satisfied\\" with the fact that Mischa cannot return. Hannibal Rising Harris wrote a 2006 prequel, Hannibal Rising, after film producer Dino De Laurentiis (who owned the cinematic rights to the Lecter character) announced an intended film project depicting Lecter's childhood and development into a serial killer with or without Harris' help. Harris would also write the film's screenplay. The novel chronicles Lecter's early life, from his birth into an aristocratic family in Lithuania in 1933, to being orphaned, along with his beloved younger sister Mischa, in 1944 when a Nazi Stuka bomber attacks a Soviet tank in front of their forest hideaway. Shortly thereafter, he and Mischa are captured by a band of Nazi collaborators, who murder and cannibalize Mischa before her brother's eyes; Lecter later learns that the collaborators also fed him Mischa's remains. Irreparably traumatized, Lecter escapes from the deserters and wanders through the forest, dazed and unable to speak. He is found and taken back to his family's old castle, which had been converted into a Soviet orphanage, where he is bullied by the other children and abused by the dean. He is adopted by his uncle Robert and Robert's Japanese wife, Lady Murasaki, who nurses him back to health and teaches him to speak again. Robert dies shortly after adopting Lecter, who forms a close, pseudo-romantic relationship with his aunt. During this time he also shows great intellectual aptitude, entering medical school at a young age and distinguishing himself. Despite his seemingly comfortable life, Lecter is consumed by a savage obsession with avenging Mischa's death. He kills for the first time as a teenager, beheading a racist fishmonger who insulted Murasaki. He then methodically tracks down, tortures, and murders each of the men who had killed his sister. In the process of taking his revenge, he forsakes his relationship with Murasaki and seemingly loses all traces of his humanity. The novel ends with Lecter being accepted to Johns Hopkins Hospital. =In film= 225x225px Red Dragon was first adapted to film in 1986 as the Michael Mann film Manhunter, although the spelling of Lecter's name was changed to \\"Lecktor\\". He was played by actor Brian Cox. Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel. In 1991, Orion Pictures produced a Jonathan Demme-directed adaptation of The Silence of the Lambs, in which Lecter was played by actor Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins' Academy Award-winning performance made Lecter into a cultural icon. In 2001, Hannibal was adapted to film, with Hopkins reprising his role. In the film adaptation, the ending is revised: Starling attempts to apprehend Lecter, who escapes after cutting off his own hand to free himself from her handcuffs. In 2002, Red Dragon was adapted again, this time under its original title, with Hopkins again as Lecter and Edward Norton as Will Graham. Hopkins wrote a screenplay for a Hannibal sequel, ending with Starling killing Lecter, but it was never produced. In late 2006, the novel Hannibal Rising was adapted into the film of the same name, which portrayed Lecter's development into a serial killer. In the film, which was finished by 2007, eight-year-old Lecter is portrayed by Aaran Thomas, while Gaspard Ulliel portrays him as a young man. Both the novel and film, as well as Ulliel‚Äôs performance as Lecter, received generally negative critical reviews. =In television= Mads Mikkelsen portrayed Hannibal for the television series. In February 2012, NBC gave a series order to Hannibal, a television adaptation of Red Dragon to be written and executive-produced by Bryan Fuller. Mads Mikkelsen plays Lecter, opposite Hugh Dancy as Will Graham. Fuller commented on Mikkelsen's version of Lecter: > \\"What I love about Mads' approach to the character is that, in our first > meeting, he was adamant that he didn't want to do Hopkins or Cox. He talked > about the character not so much as 'Hannibal Lecter the cannibal > psychiatrist', but as Satan ‚Äì this fallen angel who's enamoured with mankind > and had an affinity for who we are as people, but was definitely not among > us ‚Äì he was other. I thought that was a really cool, interesting approach, > because I love science fiction and horror and ‚Äì not that we'd ever do > anything deliberately to suggest this ‚Äì but having it subtextually play as > him being Lucifer felt like a really interesting kink to the series. It was > slightly different than anything that's been done before and it also gives > it a slightly more epic quality if you watch the show through the prism of, > 'This is Satan at work, tempting someone with the apple of their psyche'. It > appealed to all of those genre things that get me excited about any sort of > entertainment.\\" Season 1 The first season amends the series' continuity so that Graham and Lecter first work together during the hunt for Garrett Jacob Hobbs (Vladimir Jon Cubrt), the \\"Minnesota Shrike\\", a serial killer who preys on college girls. During the investigation, Lecter secretly calls Hobbs to tip him off that Graham is on to him, just to see what Hobbs will do. As a result, Hobbs turns on his own family, killing his wife and trying to kill his daughter Abigail (Kacey Rohl) as Graham charges in and shoots him dead. Killing Hobbs weighs on Graham's conscience and gives him nightmares, so his boss Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) sends him to Lecter for counseling. Throughout the first season, Lecter acts as Graham's unofficial psychiatrist, and they form a tenuous friendship. Lecter and Graham also become father figures to Abigail, and cover for her when they discover that she was her father's unwilling accomplice. Lecter is fascinated by Graham's ability to empathize with psychopaths, and he spends much of the series trying to undermine Graham's fragile sanity and push him into becoming a killer. To this end, Lecter prevents Graham from learning that he has advanced encephalitis, just to see how Graham would function under the circumstances. In the first- season finale, Lecter reluctantly frames Graham for a series of murders that he himself committed throughout the season ‚Äì including, apparently, Abigail's ‚Äì but not before Graham realizes that Lecter is the ‚ÄúChesapeake Ripper‚Äù, the very serial killer he has been trying to catch. Season 2 Throughout the beginning of the second season, Graham, who is now institutionalized, attempts to convince his skeptical former colleagues that Lecter is the real killer and begins pulling strings from within his cell in order to expose him. Meanwhile, Lecter begins to manipulate evidence from the outside, exonerating himself after the FBI's initial investigations into Graham's claims. Eventually, Graham persuades his friend and colleague Beverly Katz (Hettienne Park), a forensic scientist, to investigate Lecter in exchange for help on a case. She breaks into Lecter's house, where she finds evidence of his guilt. Lecter catches her, however, and kills her; he then sections her body vertically and displays it in tableau. Angry and vengeful, Graham convinces deranged hospital orderly Matthew Brown (Jonathan Tucker) to try to kill Lecter, but Lecter gets the better of Brown and kills him. Lecter retaliates by taking as his lover Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), a psychologist for whom Graham has romantic feelings. Lecter then exonerates Graham by planting forensic evidence of Graham's alleged victims at the scene of one of his own murders, resulting in Graham's release. He also frames his colleague Frederick Chilton (Ra√∫l Esparza) by planting a mutilated corpse in his house and \\"influencing\\" his surviving victim Miriam Lass (Anna Chlumsky), into believing that Chilton had abducted and tortured her. Graham resumes therapy with Lecter as an attempt to entrap him. Lecter is aware of the ruse, but is fascinated by the experience and allows it to continue in an attempt to examine his connection with Graham. In an attempt to push Graham into becoming a killer, Lecter sends his psychotic former patient Randall Tier (Mark O'Brien) after him, and Graham kills and mutilates Tier ‚Äì just as Lecter hoped he would. Later, Graham attacks tabloid reporter Fredericka \\"Freddy\\" Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki), who is investigating him and Lecter. Graham shares a meal with Lecter of what is implied to be her flesh, but it is soon revealed that Lounds is still alive and conspiring with Graham and Crawford to draw Lecter into their trap. Lecter and Graham acquire a common enemy in Mason Verger (Michael Pitt), a wealthy sadist whom they both despise for emotionally and sexually abusing his twin sister, and Lecter‚Äôs patient, Margot (Katharine Isabelle). Verger briefly enters therapy with Lecter to find out what Margot is saying about him, but soon kidnaps Lecter and Graham, intent on feeding them both to his prize pigs. They both escape, however, and Lecter takes Verger hostage in Graham's house. Lecter gives Mason a hallucinogenic drug cocktail, and tells him to cut off pieces of his own face and feed them to Graham's dogs. With Graham's tacit approval, Lecter then breaks Verger's neck with his bare hands, paralyzing him from the neck down. In the second-season finale, Crawford arrives at Lecter's house to arrest him. In the ensuing struggle, Lecter seriously wounds Crawford, while a very much alive Abigail Hobbs pushes Bloom out of a window. Lecter then stabs Graham and cuts Abigail's throat in front of him, and flees before the police arrive. He is shown in a post-credits scene aboard a flight to France with his psychiatrist, Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson). Season 3 The third season amends the series' continuity to incorporate events from the novels Red Dragon and Hannibal. It also changes Lecter's origin story: in this continuity, Lecter's sister Mischa was murdered, cannibalized, and fed to him by a peasant in his native Lithuania; Lecter eventually made the peasant his prisoner. Certain episodes also suggest that, in his youth, Lecter was the unidentified serial killer known as the \\"Monster of Florence\\". Months after his escape, Lecter is living in Florence with Du Maurier, working as a museum curator under the alias \\"Dr. Fell\\" ‚Äì having murdered the original curator and stolen his identity. Disgraced Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino) tries to apprehend him to collect a bounty placed by Mason Verger (Joe Anderson), who is also consulting with Bloom to capture Lecter. Lecter kills Pazzi and tries to flee the country, but is accosted by Crawford, who engages him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. Meanwhile, Graham goes looking for Lecter with the help of the doctor's family servant Chiyoh (Tao Okamoto), traveling to his adversary's home country to find out more about him. Lecter manages to escape from Crawford and meet up with Graham when he arrives to Italy again. Graham makes peace with Lecter before pulling a knife on him, but Chiyoh shoots and wounds Graham. Lecter takes Graham back to his villa and tries to perform a craniotomy on him in front of Crawford, but is interrupted by Italian detectives on Mason‚Äôs payroll, who deliver them both to his estate in Maryland. Mason‚Äôs physician Cordell Doemling (Glenn Fleshler) tells Lecter that he will mutilate him until he dies, and prepare gourmet cuisine from his flesh for Mason to eat. Influenced by Graham, Bloom frees Lecter, who suggests that Margot kill her brother, promising to take the blame. Lecter then kills Doemling, who is about to surgically remove Graham's face and graft it onto Mason's, and later instructs Margot and Bloom on how to ‚Äúmilk‚Äù the unconscious Mason's prostate to give Margot the sperm she needs to conceive a child and thus inherit the Verger family fortune. After Margot kills her brother, Lecter goes to Graham's house, carrying the wounded and unconscious Graham. When Graham wakes up, he allows Lecter to escape, claiming that he never wants to see him again. To spite Graham, Lecter surrenders to Crawford later that evening and is taken into custody. Lecter is found insane at his trial, and incarcerated in the Baltimore Hospital for the Criminally Insane, under Chilton and Bloom's care. Three years later, Graham visits him at the hospital to ask for help in profiling a serial killer dubbed \\"the Tooth Fairy\\", who murders entire families. Lecter begins communicating with the killer, Francis Dolarhyde (Richard Armitage), and gives him Graham's home address. Dolarhyde attacks and wounds Graham's wife, Molly (Nina Arianda). Bloom and Crawford threaten to take away Lecter's hospital privileges unless he lets them listen in on his conversations with Dolarhyde. Lecter complies, but then suddenly tells Dolarhyde they are listening. Bloom punishes him by taking away his books and toilet seat, and confining him in a straitjacket and muzzle. Graham, in an attempt to make Dolarhyde come out of hiding, gives an interview with Chilton and Lounds in which he describes \\"the Tooth Fairy\\" as ugly, impotent, and a product of incest. Dolarhyde, enraged by the \\"bad review\\", abducts, burns and disfigures Chilton, and sends Lecter Chilton's severed lips, one of which Lecter eats. In the series finale, \\"The Wrath of the Lamb\\", Lecter and Graham develop a plan to catch Dolarhyde, using Lecter as bait. Lecter goes with Graham on a police convoy, to be transferred to another facility in order to eventually draw the killer out. However, Graham has made a deal with Dolarhyde to free Lecter, and Dolarhyde attacks the convoy, killing the guards and letting Lecter and Graham live. Lecter then takes Graham to a secluded clifftop cottage where he previously held Abigail Hobbs and Miriam Lass. Dolarhyde tracks them down and attacks them, shooting Lecter in the back and stabbing Graham in the face. Though they are both badly wounded, Lecter and Graham manage to get the better of Dolarhyde and kill him together: Graham slices open Dolarhyde's chest, while Lecter tears out his throat with his teeth. Lecter and Graham then embrace, before Graham pushes them both off a cliff. Their ultimate fate is left ambiguous; a post-credits scene shows Du Maurier dining on her own leg at a table set for three. Series creator Bryan Fuller has said this scene is meant to suggest that Lecter and Graham survived and that Graham has become Lecter's partner in murder. Fuller has stated that Season 4 would have depicted Lecter and Graham on the run from the FBI in Argentina, mirroring Lecter and Starling's storyline from the novels. Relationship between Graham and Lecter The emotional relationship between Graham and Lecter forms the foundation of the series. In season 3, their developing romance has been taken from subtext into text. As to whether it was a part of the initial plan to portray their relationship as romantic, Fuller stated: \\"No, it naturally evolved because I guess I was absorbing so much of Mads and Hugh's performance, which felt like it was growing in intimacy, and it would have been inauthentic not to address it. Because all of these characters, and particularly Bedelia, was able to call out what she had witnessed [between Lecter and Graham], it seemed like a natural conclusion. I remember when I turned in the rewrite pages where Will asks Bedelia if Hannibal is in love with him, I got a note from Don Mancini, one of our writers who was always pushing for more homosexual text ‚Äì not just context or subtext but text, text, text ‚Äì and he was like, \\"I'm so glad you put that in there! They said it! They said it!\\" Discussing what motivated him to verbally acknowledge the romance between Graham and Lecter, Fuller said, \\"It felt like we had to shit or get off the pot, ultimately, because there had been so much going on between these two men that when Will asks, \\"Is Hannibal Lecter in love with me?\\" it is very much about death and the romance between these two men. There is a quality to connections that go above and beyond sexuality. You can have this intimate connection with somebody that then causes you to wonder where the lines of your own sexuality are. And we didn't quite broach the sexuality. It was certainly suggested, but the love is absolutely on the table.\\" Remembering how the song for the finale of the series ‚Äì \\"Love Crime\\" by Siouxsie Sioux ‚Äì was created, Fuller said: \\"It was interesting. She [Siouxsie Sioux] was like, \\"I want to write this song, and what are the things I should really be thinking about?\\" And I was like, 'this is a love story. A love story between a full-fledged psychopath and someone who has nascent psychopathic abilities.' Actually, Hannibal Lecter is not a psychopath; he's something else entirely. But it's a love relationship between two men: one of them is a cannibal, and one of them understands those cannibalistic instincts all too well.\\" =In other media= Lecter is the subject of the 1998 song \\"Hannibal (Se) Lectah\\" by The Skalatones.The Best Tracks so Far (Pork Pie, 1998). Lecter is parodied in the 2005 musical Silence! The Musical, with the character being originated by actor Brent Barrett. Lecter was parodied by Epic Rap Battles of History in the episode Jack the Ripper Vs. Hannibal Lecter, in which Lecter (Lloyd Ahlquist) raps against Jack the Ripper (Dan Bull). Real- life models Thomas Harris has given few interviews and did not explain where he got inspiration for Hannibal Lecter until mid-2013. Harris revealed that the character was inspired by a real-life doctor and murderer he met while visiting a prison in the city of Monterrey during a trip to Mexico in the 1960s when he was a 23-year-old reporter. Harris had gone to Mexico to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, an American citizen on death row for murdering three young people in the country, but he ended up also speaking to \\"Salazar\\", who saved Simmons' life after a guard shot him during an escape bid. \\"Salazar\\" revealed his dark side as he began discussing Simmons' disfigured face, tormented upbringing and how attractive his victims had been. Dr. Alfredo Ball√≠ Trevi√±o, the real-life inspiration for Lecter, according to Thomas Harris. Several reporters and investigators have traced the records and whereabouts of the Mexican prison doctor in later years and discovered that \\"Salazar\\" was in reality Alfredo Ball√≠ Trevi√±o, a physician from an upper- class Monterrey family who was found guilty of murdering his close friend and lover Jesus Castillo Rangel and mutilating his body; he was also suspected of killing and dismembering several hitch-hikers in the city outskirts during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Harris also incorporated some of these details into Buffalo Bill's development as a killer in Silence of the Lambs. Ball√≠ was initially condemned to death, but his sentence was later commuted to 20 years and he was released in 1981. After his release, Ball√≠ continued working as a physician in an austere office until his death by natural causes in 2009. In her book Evil Serial Killers, Charlotte Greig asserts that the serial killer Albert Fish was the inspiration, at least in part, for Lecter. Greig also states that to explain Lecter's pathology, Harris borrowed the story of serial killer and cannibal Andrei Chikatilo's brother Stepan being kidnapped and eaten by starving neighbors (though she states that it is unclear whether the story was true or whether Stepan Chikatilo even existed).Grieg, pg. 102 The location of the book Hannibal was inspired by the Monster of Florence. While preparing the book, Harris traveled to Italy and was present at the trial of the main suspect, Pietro Pacciani, where he was seen taking notes.

It is located at Harpenden in the English county of Hertfordshire and is a registered charity under English law. One of the station's best known and longest-running experiments is the Park Grass Experiment, a biological study that started in 1856 and has been continuously monitored ever since. History John Bennet Lawes The Rothamsted Experimental Station was founded in 1843 by John Bennet Lawes, a noted Victorian era entrepreneur and scientist who had founded one of the first artificial fertilizer manufacturing factories in 1842, on his 16th century estate, Rothamsted Manor, to investigate the impact of inorganic and organic fertilizers on crop yield. Joseph Henry Gilbert Appointing a young chemist, Joseph Henry Gilbert, as his scientific collaborator, Lawes launched the first of a series of long-term field experiments, some of which still continue. Over 57 years, Lawes and Gilbert established the foundations of modern scientific agriculture and the principles of crop nutrition. In 1902 Daniel Hall moved from Wye College to become director, taking a lower salary to join an establishment lacking money, staff, and direction. Hall decided that Rothamsted needed to specialise and was eventually successful in obtaining state support for agricultural research. In 1912 E. John Russell, who had come from Wye in 1907, took over as director until 1943, overseeing a major expansion in the 1920s, when Sir William Gammie Ogg took over until 1958 and increasing the number of staff from 140 to 471 and creating new biochemistry, nematology, and pedology departments. =Statistical science= Many distinguished scientists have been associated with Rothamsted. In 1919 Russell hired Ronald Fisher to investigate the possibility of analysing the vast amount of data accumulated from the \\"Classical Field Experiments.\\" Fisher analysed the data and stayed to create the theory of experimental design, making Rothamsted a major centre for research in statistics and genetics. Among his appointments and successors in the Statistics department were Oscar Irwin, John Wishart, Frank Yates, William Cochran and John Nelder. Indeed, many consider Rothamsted to be the most important birthplace of modern statistical theory and practice. The plaque commemorating 50 years of research, in front of the Russell Building Partly through these methods, researchers at Rothamsted have made significant contributions to agricultural science, including the discovery and development of systemic herbicides and pyrethroid insecticides, as well as pioneering contributions to the fields of virology, nematology, soil science and pesticide resistance. During World War II, aiming to increase crop yields for a nation at war, a team under the leadership of Judah Hirsch Quastel developed 2,4-D, still the most widely used weed-killer in the world. =Recent history= In 1987, Rothamsted, the Long Ashton Research Station, and Broom's Barn Experimental Station merged to form the Institute of Arable Crops Research (IACR). The Long Ashton Research Station was closed in 2002, with some of its staff moved to Rothamsted, whilst Broom's Barn is operated as an experimental farm for Rothamsted. Rothamsted is now operated by a grouping of private organizations under the name of Rothamsted Research and is mainly funded by various branches of the UK government through the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Rothamsted Research supports around 350 scientists (including 50 visiting scientists), 150 administrative staff and 60 PhD students. As well as the Rothamsted site Rothamsted Research operates: * Broom's Barn, a experimental farm near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, which is the UK's national centre for sugar beet research. * North Wyke, of grassland near Okehampton, Devon. It provides a \\"Farm Platform\\" allowing research teams to conduct experiments on three mini farms. It was formerly part of the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research. Its research program has four main areas: * 20:20 Wheat: increasing wheat productivity to yield 20 (metric) tonnes per hectare in 20 years from the current nine tonnes per hectare in 2012. * Cropping carbon: optimising carbon capture by grasslands and perennial energy crops, such as willow. * Designing seeds: improved health and nutrition through seeds. * Delivering sustainable systems: investigating sustainable agricultural systems to increase productivity while minimising environmental impact. It also operates: * The Insect Survey: two national networks for monitoring insect populations in the UK.Harrington, Richard and Woiwod, Ian (February 2007) Foresight from hindsight: The Rothamsted Insect Survey Outlooks on Pest Management, Volume 18 , Number 1, Retrieved 22 May 2012 * PHI-base: a database of multiple pathogen- host interactions.  GM protest  In 2012 Rothamsted started testing Genetically modified wheat wheat which had been modified to produce an aphid alarm pheromone produced by aphids when under attack to helps deter pests. This trial attracted criticism from anti-GM groups and \\"about 200\\" people attempted to occupy the site on 27 May 2012. They were prevented by a large police presence and the protest ended peacefully. However one protester did trespass and damage the crop. The protester was later arrested, tried and fined ¬£4,000.(19 July 2014) GM Crop Damage Fine ITV News, Retrieved 9 July 20915 A video appeal by scientists at Rothamsted led to over 6,000 people signing a \\"Don't destroy research\\" petition organised by Sense About Science. Sense About Science also organised a question and answer session with scientists. The author Mark Lynas commented that Rothamsted's successful campaign may be a turning point for GMOs. The results published in 2015 showed that the trial wheat variety was no better than standard wheat varieties in deterring pests.

King Louis XIV confronted the combined opposition of the princes, the nobility, the law courts (parlements), and most of the French people, and yet won out in the end. The dispute started when the government of France issued seven fiscal edicts, six of which were to increase taxation. The parlements pushed back and questioned the constitutionality of the King's actions and sought to check his powers. The Fronde was divided into two campaigns, the Parlementary Fronde and the Fronde of the Princes. The timing of the outbreak of the Parlementary Fronde, directly after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) that ended the Thirty Years' War, was significant. The nuclei of the armed bands that terrorized parts of France under aristocratic leaders during this period had been hardened in a generation of war in Germany, where troops still tended to operate autonomously. Louis XIV, impressed as a young ruler with the experience of the Fronde, came to reorganize French fighting forces under a stricter hierarchy whose leaders ultimately could be made or unmade by the King. Cardinal Mazarin blundered into the crisis but came out well ahead at the end. The Fronde represented the final attempt of the French nobility to do battle with the king, and they were humiliated. In the long-term, the Fronde served to strengthen royal authority, but weakened the economy. The Fronde facilitated the emergence of absolute monarchy. Name The French word fronde means \\"sling\\"; Parisian crowds used slings to smash the windows of supporters of Cardinal Mazarin. Cardinal de Retz in Book II of his Memoirs attributes the usage to a witticism: \\"Bachoumont once said, in jest, that the Parlement acted like the schoolboys in the Paris ditches, who fling stones [frondent, that is, fling using slings], and run away when they see the constable, but meet again as soon as he turns his back.\\" He goes on to state that emblems based on this nickname became quite popular and were placed on hats, fans, and gloves, and even were baked onto bread (ibid.). Origins Cardinal Mazarin, French diplomat and statesman; portrait attributed to Mathieu Le Nain The insurrection did not start with revolutionary goals; it aimed to protect the ancient liberties from royal encroachments and to defend the established rights of the parlements ‚Äì courts of appeal rather than legislative bodies like the English parliaments ‚Äì and especially the right of the Parlement of Paris to limit the king's power by refusing to register decrees that ran against custom. The liberties under attack were feudal, not of individuals, but of chartered towns, where they defended the prerogatives accorded to offices in the legal patchwork of local interests and provincial identities that was France. The Fronde in the end provided an incentive for the establishment of royalist absolutism, since the disorders eventually discredited the feudal concept of liberty. The pressure that saw the traditional liberties under threat came in the form of extended and increased taxes as the Crown needed to recover from its expenditures in the recent wars. The costs of the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648) constrained Mazarin's government to raise funds by traditional means, the imp√¥ts, the taille, and the occasional aides. The nobility refused to be so taxed, based on their old liberties, or privileges, and the brunt fell upon the bourgeoisie. The movement soon degenerated into factions, some of which attempted to overthrow Mazarin and to reverse the policies of his predecessor Cardinal Richelieu (in office 1624‚Äì1642) who had taken power for the crown from great territorial nobles, some of whom became leaders of the Fronde. When Louis XIV became king in 1643, he was only a child, and though Richelieu had died the year before, his policies continued to dominate French life under his successor Cardinal Mazarin. Most historians consider that Louis's later insistence on absolutist rule and depriving the nobility of actual power was a result of these events in his childhood. The term frondeur was later used to refer to anyone who suggested that the power of the king should be limited, and has now passed into conservative French usage to refer to anyone who will show insubordination or engage in criticism of the powers in place.Nina R. Gelbart, \\"'Frondeur' Journalism in the 1770s: Theater Criticism and Radical Politics in the Prerevolutionary French Press.\\" Eighteenth Century Studies (1984): 493‚Äì514. in JSTOR First Fronde, the Parlementary Fronde (1648‚Äì1649) In May 1648 a tax levied on judicial officers of the Parlement of Paris provoked not merely a refusal to pay but also a condemnation of earlier financial edicts and a demand for the acceptance of a scheme of constitutional reforms framed by a united committee of the parlement (the Chambre Saint-Louis), composed of members of all the sovereign courts of Paris. The military record of the Parlementary Fronde is almost blank. In August 1648, feeling strengthened by the news of the Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√©'s victory at Lens (20 August 1648), Mazarin suddenly arrested the leaders of the parlement, whereupon Paris broke into insurrection and barricaded the streets. The noble faction demanded the calling of an assembly of the Estates General (last convoked in 1615). The nobles believed that in the Estates-General they could continue to control the bourgeois element as they had in the past. The royal faction, having no army at its immediate disposal, had to release the prisoners and promise reforms ‚Äì on the night of 22 October it fled from Paris. But France's signing of the Peace of Westphalia (Treaty of M√ºnster, 24 October 1648) allowed the French army to return from the frontiers, and by January 1649 Cond√© had put Paris under siege. The two warring parties signed the Peace of Rueil (11 March 1649) after little blood had been shed. The Parisians, though still and always anti-cardinalist, had refused to ask for Spanish aid, as proposed by their princely and noble adherents under Armand de Bourbon, prince de Conti, and having no prospect of military success without such aid, the noble party submitted to the government and received concessions. Second Fronde, the Fronde of the Princes (1650‚Äì1653) From then on the Fronde became a story of intrigues, half-hearted warfare in a scramble for power and control of patronage, losing all trace of its first constitutional phase. The leaders were discontented princes and nobles: Gaston, Duke of Orleans (the king's uncle); the great Louis II, Prince de Cond√© and his brother Armand, Prince of Conti; Fr√©d√©ric, the Duke of Bouillon, and his brother Henri, Viscount of Turenne. To these must be added Gaston's daughter, Mademoiselle de Montpensier (La grande Mademoiselle); Cond√©'s sister, Madame de Longueville; Madame de Chevreuse; and the astute intriguer Jean Fran√ßois Paul de Gondi, the future Cardinal de Retz. The military operations fell into the hands of war- experienced mercenaries, led by two great, and many lesser, generals. =January 1650‚ÄìDecember 1651= \\"Louis XIV Crushes the Fronde\\" by Gilles Gu√©rin 1654 The peace of Rueil lasted until the end of 1649. The princes, received at court once more, renewed their intrigues against Mazarin. On 14 January 1650, Cardinal Mazarin, having come to an understanding with Monsieur Gondi and Madame de Chevreuse, suddenly arrested Cond√©, Conti, and Longueville. This time it was Turenne, before and afterwards the most loyal soldier of his day, who headed the armed rebellion. Listening to the promptings of Madame de Longueville, he resolved to rescue her brothers, particularly Cond√©, his old comrade in the battles of Freiburg and N√∂rdlingen. Turenne hoped to do this with Spanish assistance; a powerful Spanish army assembled in Artois under the archduke Leopold Wilhelm, governor-general of the Spanish Netherlands. But peasants of the countryside rose against the invaders; the royal army in Champagne was in the capable hands of Caesar de Choiseul, comte du Plessis-Praslin, who counted 52 years of age and 36 of war experience; and the little fortress of Guise successfully resisted the archduke's attack. At that point Mazarin drew upon Plessis-Praslin's army for reinforcements to be sent to subdue the rebellion in the south forcing the royal general to retire. Then Archduke Leopold Wilhelm decided that he had spent enough of the king of Spain's money and men in the French quarrel. His regular army withdrew into winter quarters, and left Turenne to deliver the princes with a motley host of Frondeurs and Lorrainers. Plessis-Praslin by force and bribery secured the surrender of Rethel on 13 December 1650 and Turenne, who had advanced to relieve the place, fell back hurriedly. But he was a terrible opponent, and Plessis-Praslin and Mazarin himself, who accompanied the army, had many misgivings as to the result of a lost battle. The marshal chose nevertheless to force Turenne to a decision, and the Battle of Blanc-Champ (near Somme-Py) or Rethel was the consequence. Both sides were at a standstill in strong positions, Plessis-Praslin doubtful of the trustworthiness of his cavalry, but Turenne was too weak to attack, when a dispute for precedence arose between the Gardes Fran√ßaises and the Picardie regiment. The royal infantry had to be rearranged in order of regimental seniority, and Turenne, seeing and desiring to profit by the attendant disorder, came out of his stronghold and attacked with the greatest vigour. The battle (15 December 1650) was severe and for a time doubtful, but Turenne's Frondeurs gave way in the end, and his army, as an army, ceased to exist. Turenne himself, undeceived as to the part he was playing in the drama, asked and received the young king's pardon, and meantime the court, with the maison du roi and other loyal troops, had subdued the minor risings without difficulty. (March‚ÄìApril 1651). Cond√©, Conti, and Longueville were released, and by April 1651 the rebellion had everywhere collapsed. Then followed a few months of hollow peace and the court returned to Paris. Mazarin, an object of hatred to all the princes, had already retired into exile. His absence left the field free for mutual jealousies, and for the remainder of the year anarchy reigned in France. =December 1651‚ÄìFebruary 1653= In December 1651 Cardinal Mazarin returned to France with a small army. The war began again, and this time Turenne and Cond√© were pitted against one another. After this campaign the civil war ceased, but in the several other campaigns of the Franco-Spanish War that followed, the two great soldiers were opposed to one another, Turenne as the defender of France, Cond√© as a Spanish invader. The d√©but of the new Frondeurs took place in Guyenne (February‚ÄìMarch 1652), while their Spanish ally, the archduke Leopold Wilhelm, captured various northern fortresses. On the Loire, where the centre of gravity was soon transferred, the Frondeurs were commanded by intriguers and quarrelsome lords, until Cond√©'s arrival from Guyenne. His bold leadership made itself felt in the Bl√©neau (7 April 1652), in which a portion of the royal army was destroyed; but fresh troops came up to oppose him. From the skillful dispositions made by his opponents, Cond√© felt the presence of Turenne and broke off the action. The royal army did likewise. Cond√© invited the commander of Turenne's rearguard to supper, chaffed him unmercifully for allowing the prince's men to surprise him in the morning, and by way of farewell remarked to his guest, \\"Quel dommage que de braves gens comme nous se coupent la gorge pour un faquin\\" (\\"It's too bad decent people like us are cutting our throats for a scoundrel\\")‚Äîan incident and a remark that displayed the feudal arrogance which ironically led to the iron-handed absolutism of Louis XIV. After Bl√©neau, both armies marched to Paris to negotiate with the parlement, de Retz and Mlle de Montpensier, while the archduke took more fortresses in Flanders, and Charles, duke of Lorraine, with an army of plundering mercenaries, marched through Champagne to join Cond√©. As to the latter, Turenne maneuvered past Cond√© and planted himself in front of the mercenaries, and their leader, not wishing to expend his men against the old French regiments, consented to depart with a money payment and the promise of two tiny Lorraine fortresses. A few more maneuvers, and the royal army was able to hem in the Frondeurs in the Faubourg St. Antoine (2 July 1652) with their backs to the closed gates of Paris. The royalists attacked all along the line and won a signal victory in spite of the knightly prowess of the prince and his great lords, but at the critical moment Gaston's daughter persuaded the Parisians to open the gates and to admit Cond√©'s army. She herself turned the guns of the Bastille on the pursuers. An insurrectionist government appeared in Paris and proclaimed Monsieur lieutenant-general of the realm. Mazarin, feeling that public opinion was solidly against him, left France again, and the bourgeois of Paris, quarreling with the princes, permitted the king to enter the city on 21 October 1652. Mazarin returned unopposed in February 1653. Franco-Spanish War (1635‚Äì1659) Battle of the Dunes in 1658 Reception of the Grand Cond√© at Versailles following his victory at Seneffe. The Grand Cond√© advances towards Louis XIV in a respectful manner with laurel wreaths on his path, while captured enemy flags are displayed on both sides of the stairs. It marked the end of Cond√©'s exile, following his participation to the Fronde. The Fronde as a civil war was now over. The whole country, wearied of anarchy and disgusted with the princes, came to look to the king's party as the party of order and settled government, and thus the Fronde prepared the way for the absolutism of Louis XIV. The general war continued in Flanders, Catalonia, and Italy wherever a Spanish and a French garrison were face to face, and Cond√©, with the wreck of his army, openly and defiantly entered the service of the king of Spain. This \\"Spanish Fronde\\" was almost purely a military affair. In 1653 France was so exhausted that neither invaders nor defenders were able to gather supplies to enable them to take the field till July. At one moment, near P√©ronne, Cond√© had Turenne at a serious disadvantage, but he could not galvanize the Spanish general Count Fuensalda√±a, who was more solicitous to preserve his master's soldiers than to establish Cond√© as mayor of the palace to the king of France, and the armies drew apart again without fighting. In 1654 the principal incident was the siege and relief of Arras. On the night of 24‚Äì25 August the lines of circumvallation drawn round that place by the prince were brilliantly stormed by Turenne's army, and Cond√© won equal credit for his safe withdrawal of the besieging corps under cover of a series of bold cavalry charges led by himself as usual, sword in hand. In 1655 Turenne captured the fortresses of Landrecies, Cond√© and St Ghislain. In 1656 the prince of Cond√© avenged the defeat of Arras by storming Turenne's circumvallation around Valenciennes (16 July), but Turenne drew off his forces in good order. The campaign of 1657 was uneventful, and is only to be remembered because a body of 6,000 English infantry, sent by Cromwell in pursuance of his treaty of alliance with Mazarin, took part in it. The presence of the English contingent and its very definite purpose of making Dunkirk a new Calais, to be held by England forever, gave the next campaign a character of certainty and decision which was entirely wanting in the rest of the war. Dunkirk was besieged promptly and in great force, and when Don Juan of Austria and Cond√© appeared with the relieving army from Fumes, Turenne advanced boldly to meet them. The Battle of the Dunes, fought on 14 June 1658, was the first real trial of strength since the battle of the Faubourg St Antoine. Successes on one wing were compromised by failure on the other, but in the end Cond√© drew off with heavy losses, the success of his own cavalry charges having entirely failed to make good the defeat of the Spanish right wing amongst the Dunes. Here the \\"red-coats\\" made their first appearance on a continental battlefield, under the leadership of Sir William Lockhart, Cromwell's ambassador at Paris. They astonished both armies by the stubborn fierceness of their assaults. Dunkirk fell, and was handed over to the English Protectorate, as promised, so flying the St George's Cross until Charles II sold it to the king of France in 1662. A last desultory campaign followed in 1659‚Äîthe twenty-fifth year of a conflict between France and Spain which had begun during the Thirty Years' War‚Äîand the peace of the Pyrenees was signed on 5 November. On 27 January 1660 the prince asked and obtained at Aix-en-Provence the forgiveness of Louis XIV. The later careers of Turenne and Cond√© were as obedient subjects of their sovereign.

This is often done on whitewater or different degrees of rough water. Dealing with risk and the need for teamwork is often a part of the experience. This activity as an adventure sport has become popular since the 1950s, if not earlier, evolving from individuals paddling to rafts with double-bladed paddles or oars to multi-person rafts propelled by single-bladed paddles and steered by a person at the stern, or by the use of oars.Martin, Tom, and Whitis, Duwain, (2016). Guide to the Colorado & Green Rivers in the Canyonlands of Utah & Colorado. Flagstaff, Arizona, Vishnu Temple Press, pg. 12-13, Rafting on certain sections of rivers is considered an extreme sport and can be fatal, while other sections are not so extreme or difficult. Rafting is also a competitive sport practiced around the world which culminates in a world rafting championship event between the participating nations. The International Rafting Federation, often referred to as the IRF, is the worldwide body which oversees all aspects of the sport.  Equipment  Rafting equipment has continuously evolved and developed significantly from old rubber WW II era military surplus rafts. Modern whitewater rafts are typically made with advanced nylon or Kevlar infused plastics like PVC or urethane; though many of the more entry-level low-cost manufacturers still use a glued rubber. Plastic is generally more durable, longer-lasting, and just as easy to repair compared to older rubber rafts. Paddles and oars are the typical means of propulsion for rafts and come in many sizes and varieties with specific river conditions in mind. = Paddles = Paddles are a combination of layered wood, plastic, aluminium, carbon fiber, or other advanced composites. There are many types and combinations of these materials with lower-end entry-level paddles being composed of cheap aluminum and plastic. Higher-end models are constructed of high-end composites and mostly utilized by professional rafting guides, raft racers, and expedition paddlers. The basic paddle designed for rafting consist of 3 parts: * Single blade * Shaft * T-grip Paddles are typically utilized by rafters in smaller and lower volume rivers where rocks and other hazards can damage larger oars. Paddles are typically used by guests on commercial trips as well since it is seen as a more engaging way to enjoy the river trip. When paddles are used in a raft it is referred to as \\"paddling\\" or \\"paddle guiding\\". = Oars = Oars are commonly made from the same materials as paddles. Wood, plastic, aluminum, and carbon fiber.Oars are designed for several different rivers with sightly different blade shapes built to handle varying river conditions. Wooden oars are typically built as one solid piece to help retain strength and resilience of the oar while it is strained under a load. Composite or metallic oars typically are made in 3 parts: * Blade * Shaft * Grip All of these parts are interchangeable and can be upgraded and altered in many ways to make rowing more enjoyable. Oars are generally used on wider flatter rivers of higher volume to facilitate moving more efficiently across long slow-moving pools, though anglers will often use shorter oars on smaller rafts in low volume rivers to help them maintain an advantageous upstream position while anglers cast from the raft. When a raft utilizes oars it is called \\"rowing\\" though many people typically incorrectly refer to this as \\"oaring\\" or \\"oar framing\\", however, these terms are incorrect and often suggest inexperience when used in conversation with members of the rafting community. Oars typically use one of 2 systems to attach to the boat, but in either case, they interface with the boat through a large metallic frame strapped to the boat called an \\"oar frame\\". Oars connect to the frame by either a pin and clip system or a system called oarlocks. Either system connects to the frame via oar towers on either side of the frame.  Pins and clips  Pins are referred to as \\"thole pins\\" or \\"oar pins\\". A large metal clip attaches to the oar and clips onto the pin. The top of the pin has a rubber or plastic stopper that prevents the oar from slipping over the top of the pin. The bottom of the pin connects to an oar tower designed to hold the pin in place. This system is an older system though it is useful for certain types of river running namely big, dangerous Class 5 rivers that require your oars to stay in place as much as possible.  Oarlocks  Oarlocks or locks are a more common form of attachment for oars as they allow the rower to \\"feather\\" the oar back and forth as they row making it easier on the person using the oars to continue downstream. Oarlocks look like a pin topped with a U-shaped metal flange. The oars slide into the gap between the U-shaped metal pieces and can be held in place with a plastic stopper called an oarlock. The oarlock allows the oar to maintain its position on the oar at a correct length for rowing. History Whitewater rafting can be traced back to 1811 when the first recorded attempt to navigate the Snake River in Wyoming was planned. With no training, experience, or proper equipment, the river was found to be too difficult and dangerous. Hence, it was given the nickname \\"Mad River\\". On June 9, 1940, Clyde Smith lead a successful trip through the Snake River Canyon.‚ÄúWhitewater Rafting.‚Äù Whitewater Rafting History Comments, 2018, www.whitewaterrafting.com/rafting- info/history. Classes of white water Rafting on the Pacuare River, Costa Rica Otherwise known as the International Scale of River Difficulty, below are the six grades of difficulty in white water rafting. They range from simple to very dangerous and potential death or serious injuries. Class 1: Very small rough areas, might require slight maneuvering. (Skill level: Very basic) Class 2: Some rough water, maybe some rocks, might require some maneuvering. (Skill level: Basic paddling skill) Class 3: Small waves, maybe a small drop, but no considerable danger. May require significant maneuvering. (Skill level: Some experience in rafting) Class 4: Whitewater, medium waves, maybe rocks, maybe a considerable drop, sharp maneuvers may be needed. (Skill level: Exceptional rafting experience) Class 5: Whitewater, large waves, large volume, possibility of large rocks and hazards, possibility of a large drop, requires precise maneuvering. (Skill level: Full mastery of rafting) Class 6: Class 6 rapids are considered to be so dangerous that they are effectively unnavigable on a reliably safe basis. Rafters can expect to encounter substantial whitewater, huge waves, huge rocks and hazards, and/or substantial drops that will impart severe impacts beyond the structural capacities and impact ratings of almost all rafting equipment. Traversing a Class 6 rapid has a dramatically increased likelihood of ending in serious injury or death compared to lesser classes. (Skill level: Full mastery of rafting, and even then it may not be safe)Costello, Ben. \\"A Clear and Thorough Safety Talk Is One of the Most Important Elements of Any Competent, Professionally Run River Trip.\\" Mountain WhiteWater, Apr. 2018, www.raftmw.com/river-safety-rescue-the-safety-talk/. Safety The overall risk level on a rafting trip using proper precautions is low. Thousands of people safely enjoy rafting trips every year. Like most outdoor sports, rafting, in general, has become safer over the years. Expertise in the sport has increased, and equipment has become more specialized and improved in quality. As a result, the difficulty rating of most river runs has changed. A classic example is the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, which historically had a reputation far exceeding its actual safety statistics. Today the Grand Canyon sees hundreds of safe rafting trips by both do it yourself rafters and commercial river concessionaires.Myers, Thomas, Becker, Christopher, and Stevens, Lawrence, (1999). Fateful Journey: Injury and Death on Colorado River Trips in Grand Canyon. Flagstaff, Arizona, Red Lake Books, pp. 110‚Äì111, Rafting companies generally require customers to sign waiver forms indicating understanding and acceptance of potential serious risks. Both do-it-yourself and commercial rafting trips often begin with safety presentations to educate rafting participants about problems that may arise. Depending on the area, safety regulations covering rafting, both for the general do-it-yourself public as well as commercial operators, may exist in legislation. These range from the mandatory wearing of lifejackets, carrying certain equipment such as whistles and throwable flotation devices, to certification of commercial outfitters and their employees. It is generally advisable to discuss safety measures with a commercial rafting operator before signing on for that type of trip. The required equipment needed is essential information to be considered. Risks in white water rafting stem from both environmental dangers and from improper behavior. Certain features on rivers are inherently unsafe and have remained consistently so. These would include ‚Äòkeeper hydraulics‚Äô, ‚Äòstrainers‚Äô (e.g. fallen trees), dams (especially low- head dams, which tend to produce river-wide keeper hydraulics), undercut rocks, and of course dangerously high waterfalls. Even in safe areas, moving water can always present risks‚Äîsuch as when a swimmer attempts to stand up on a rocky riverbed in strong current, risking foot entrapment. Irresponsible behavior related to rafting while intoxicated has also contributed to many accidents. Ghiglieri, Michael, and Myers, Thomas (2001). Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon. Flagstaff, Arizona, Puma Press, p. 212, Typical rafting injuries include trauma from striking an object, traumatic stress from the interaction of the paddler‚Äôs positioning and equipment and the force of the water, overuse injuries, submersion/environmental injuries, and non- environmental injuries due to undisclosed medical conditions (such as heart problems). Studies have shown that injury rates in rafting are relatively low, though they may be skewed due to a large number of unreported incidents. Fatalities are rare in both commercial and do-it-yourself rafting. Meta- analyses have calculated that fatalities ranged between 0.55 \\\\- 0.86% per 100,000 user days. Environmental issues Rafting in Montenegro Like all outdoor activities, rafting must balance its use of nature with the conservation of rivers as a natural resource and habitat. Because of these issues, some rivers now have regulations restricting the annual seasons and daily operating times or numbers of rafters. Conflicts have arisen when commercial rafting operators, often in co-operation with municipalities and tourism associations, alter the riverbed by dredging and/or blasting in order to eliminate safety hazards or create more interesting whitewater features in the river. Environmentalists argue that this may have negative impacts to riparian and aquatic ecosystems, while proponents claim these measures are usually only temporary since a riverbed is naturally subject to permanent changes during large floods and other events. Another conflict involves the distribution of scarce river permits to either the do-it-yourself public or commercial rafting companies.Ingram, Jeff, (2003). Hijacking a River: A Political History of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. Flagstaff, Arizona, Vishnu Temple Press, pp. 134‚Äì137, Rafting by do-it-yourself rafters and commercial rafting companies contributes to the economy of many regions which in turn may contribute to the protection of rivers from hydroelectric power generation, diversion for irrigation, and other development. Additionally, white water rafting trips can promote environmentalism. Multi- day rafting trips by do-it-yourself rafters and commercial rafting companies through the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System have the potential to develop environmental stewardship and general environmental behavior. Studies suggest that environmental efficacy increases when there is an increase in the length of the trip, daily immersion, and the amount of resource education by trip participants.

What we do. Retrieved 2 January 2019. History=International Fund for Monuments (1965‚Äì1984)= The International Fund for Monuments (IFM) was an organization created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909‚Äì1994) after his retirement from the U.S. Army in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project to arrest the settlement of the Leaning Tower of Pisa by freezing the soil underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 as a vehicle for the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the rock-hewn churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist Lila Acheson Wallace (1889‚Äì1984), who offered $150,000 to the International Fund for Monuments and UNESCO for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of Haile Selassie I and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to Easter Island (Rapa Nui) in Chile. Gray formed the Easter Island Committee, with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer Thor Heyerdahl (1914‚Äì2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as moai exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist William Mulloy (1917‚Äì1978), Gray selected an , five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the Seagram Building in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C. Gokarna, Nepal, a conservation project of the International Fund for Monuments. An important chapter for the organization started with its involvement in the broad international effort led by UNESCO for the protection of the city of Venice, Italy from catastrophic flooding. After the extremely high tide of 4 November 1966, the city, including the historic Piazza San Marco, was inundated for more than twenty-four hours. The International Fund for Monuments set up a Venice Committee, with Professor John McAndrew (1904‚Äì1978) of Wellesley College as chairman and Gray as executive secretary. On the part of the Committee, appeals were made to the American public, and local chapters set up in American cities. This early initiative led to the formation of the independent organization Save Venice in 1971.\\"History & Mission: History\\". Save Venice. savevenice.org. Retrieved 21 November 2018. These efforts helped establish a reputation for IFM. In Spain, the organization formed a Committee for Spain under the leadership of American diplomat and U.S. Ambassador to Spain in 1965‚Äì67 Angier Biddle Duke (1915‚Äì1995). At the invitation of UNESCO in the 1970s IFM became involved in architectural conservation in Nepal, where the organization adopted the Mahadev temple complex in Gokarna, in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley. The 14th-century temple building was surveyed, rotten timbers were replaced, and the foundations were strengthened. Sculpted wooden architectural elements were painstakingly cleaned of layers of a motor oil coating that had been applied annually for protection.

The site was the keystone of a defensive system constructed in the early period of Haitian independence to protect the young state from French attempts to reclaim it as a colony. Local artisans reconstructed wooden and tile roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress. IFM also sponsored a traveling exhibition and a film about the history of the Citadelle, which was used for educational purposes in the United States.World Monuments Fund. 1996. World Monuments Fund: The First Thirty Years. New York, NY: World Monuments Fund , p. 10-21. Programs The ghost town of Craco, Italy, a conservation project of the World Monuments Fund (2010) Through donations and matching funds, WMF has worked with local community and government partners worldwide to safeguard and conserve places of historic value for future generations. To date, WMF has worked at more than 500 sites in 91 countries, including many UNESCO World Heritage Sites. WMF has worked at internationally famous tourist attractions as well as lesser-known sites. Highly prominent projects are many temples at Angkor, Cambodia, starting in 1990, including Preah Khan and Phnom Bakheng; the Ch√¢teau de Chantilly in Chantilly, France; the ghost town of Craco, Italy; many structures in Rome, including the Temple of Hercules, Santa Maria Antiqua, and the House of Augustus; several sites on Easter Island; various sites at ancient Luxor in Egypt; Lalibela in Ethiopia; San Ignacio Min√≠ in Argentina; the ancient Maya city of Naranjo, Guatemala; the Segovia Aqueduct in Segovia, Spain; as well as 25 projects in Venice, Italy, over 20 years. WMF has also participated in projects in the United States, including Ellis Island, Taos Pueblo, Mesa Verde National Park, the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society, and many sites in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. =World Monuments Watch= Every two years WMF publishes the World Monuments Watch (formerly the World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the World Monuments Watch, WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites. The sites are nominated by international and local preservation groups and professionals, including local authorities. Sites of all types, including secular and religious architecture, archaeological sites, landscapes and townscapes, and dating from all time periods, from ancient to contemporary, are eligible. An independent panel of international experts reviews and selects the sites that make up the list.Press Release: World Monuments Watch List In 2010 the panelists were Christina Cameron, Alfredo Conti, Pierre-Andr√© Lablaude, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Christopher Young. =Special Initiatives= WMF also operates a number of special initiatives that transcend individual projects at specific sites and address broader themes in heritage preservation. This video details WMF's site management plan for Babylon, a blueprint for working on the site today as well as planning for the future. Iraq's Cultural Heritage Following the Iraq War WMF created the Iraq Cultural Heritage Conservation Initiative to address the many threats to Iraq‚Äôs cultural heritage resulting from the occupation and from a long period of political isolation and conflict. At the ancient city of Babylon WMF has launched a program with the support of the United States Department of State to develop a comprehensive site management plan, help local officials prepare a nomination for World Heritage listing, and establish site boundaries for the long-term protection of the ancient city.John Noble Wilford. \\"After Years of War and Abuse, New Hope for Ancient Babylon.\\" New York Times, March 22, 2010. Modernism at Risk In 2006, with the support of the Knoll furniture company, WMF launched Modernism at Risk, an advocacy and conservation program for Modernist architecture. Through this initiative, the biennial World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize was established in 2008.

It is part of the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and is North America's deepest river gorge at . Notably, Hells Canyon runs deeper than the better- known Grand Canyon. The canyon was carved by the waters of the Snake River, which flows more than below the canyon's west rim on the Oregon side and below the peaks of Idaho's Seven Devils Mountains range to the east. Most of the area is inaccessible by road. Geology The geologic history of the rocks of Hells Canyon began 300 million years ago with an arc of volcanoes that emerged from the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Over millions of years, the volcanoes subsided and limestone built up on the underwater platforms. The basins between them were filled with sedimentary rock. Between 130 and 17 million years ago, the ocean plate carrying the volcanoes collided with and became part of the North American continent. A period of volcanic activity followed, and much of the area was covered with floods of basalt lava, which smoothed the topography into a high plateau. The Snake River began carving Hells Canyon out of the plateau about 6 million years ago. Significant canyon-shaping events occurred as recently as 15,000 years ago during a massive outburst flood from Glacial Lake Bonneville in Utah. History Snake River winding through Hells Canyon =Inhabitatants= The earliest known residents in Hells Canyon were the Nez Perc√© tribe. Others tribes visiting the area were the Shoshone-Bannock, northern Paiute and Cayuse Indians. The mild winters, and ample plant and wildlife attracted human habitation. Pictographs and petroglyphs on the walls of the canyon are a record of the Indian settlements. In 1806, three members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition entered the Hells Canyon region along the Salmon River. They turned back without seeing the deep parts of the canyon. It was not until 1811 that the Wilson Price Hunt expedition explored Hells Canyon while seeking a shortcut to the Columbia River. Hunger and cold forced them to turn back, as also did many explorers who were defeated by the canyon's inaccessibility. There remains no evidence in the canyon of their attempts; their expedition journals are the only documentation. Early explorers sometimes called this area Box Canyon or Snake River Canyon. The early miners were next to follow. In the 1860s gold was discovered in river bars near present-day Hells Canyon National Recreation Area, and miners soon penetrated Hells Canyon; however, gold mining there was not profitable. Evidence of their endeavors remains visible along the corridor of the Snake River. Later efforts concentrated on hard-rock mining, requiring complex facilities. Evidence of these developments is visible today, especially near the mouth of the Imnaha River. In the 1880s there was a short- lived homesteading boom, but the weather was unsuited to farming and ranching, and most settlers soon gave up. However, some ranchers still operate within the boundaries of the National Recreation Area. In May 1887, perhaps 34 Chinese gold miners were ambushed and killed in the area, in an event known as the Hells Canyon Massacre. =Damming the Snake River= After completion of large hydropower dams on the Columbia River in the 1930s through the 1950s, several entities sought approval from the Federal Power Commission to build dams on the Snake River, including a high dam in Hells Canyon. In 1955, the commission issued a license to the Idaho Power Company to build a three-dam complex in the canyon: * The first of the three, Brownlee Dam, at river mile (RM) 285 or river kilometer (RK) 459, was finished in 1960. * Oxbow Dam, downstream, was finished in 1972 Hells Canyon Dam * Hells Canyon Dam, below Oxbow, was completed in 1987. The three dams have a combined generating capacity of 1,167 megawatts (MW) of electricity. The complex, which provides about 70 percent of Idaho's hydroelectricity, blocks migration of salmon and other anadromous fish upstream of Hells Canyon Dam. Two additional dams, Mountain Sheep and Pleasant Valley, were proposed in 1955 above the mouth of the Salmon River and below the Hells Canyon Dam. The Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968 held up progress, but with the energy crisis, they were revived in 1975; these projects were sponsored by consortiums Pacific Northwest Power Company and Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS). At the end of that year, President Gerald Ford signed legislation to create the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area and the projects Recreation There are many recreational activities available within the canyon.Recreation: Wallowa- Whitman National Forest. Retrieved December 2, 2014, from http://www.fs.usda.gov/recmain/wallowa-whitman/recreation Activities in Hells Canyon include fishing, jet boat tours, hunting, hiking, camping and whitewater sports (mainly rafting and kayaking). Much of these activities rely on the mighty Snake River, which is the main factor in the creation of Hells Canyon. The Snake River is home to numerous fish species, an abundance of class I-IV rapids (some of largest in the Pacific Northwest), diverse wildlife and miles of trail systems. These key components make Hells Canyon an outdoor recreation mecca that brings in tourists from around the world. Hells canyon offers tours year round, while most of the whitewater activities peak in summer months. To participate in these recreational activities one can utilize commercial charters or private trips. Jet Boat Tour Departing from Pittsburg Landing Access No roads cross Hells Canyon and only three roads reach the Snake River between Hells Canyon Dam and the Oregon‚ÄìWashington state boundary further downstream. From Oxbow Bridge near Copperfield, Oregon, Hells Canyon Road follows the Idaho side of the river downstream to the Hells Canyon Dam. The road crosses the dam and continues another mile to the Hells Canyon Visitor Center on the Oregon side. Further north on the Idaho side, Deer Creek Road connects White Bird, Idaho, to the river at Pittsburg Landing. Near the northern end of the canyon, Forest Road 4260 (Lower Imnaha Road), the last part of which is too rough for most cars, reaches the river at Dug Bar, from Imnaha, Oregon.Sullivan, pp. 268‚Äì76 On the canyon rims, viewpoints accessible by road include Hat Point and Buckhorn in Oregon and Heavens Gate in Idaho.

He served as Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford. Life He was the son of the rector of Hauxwell, Yorkshire, and was privately educated by his father, Mark James Pattison. His sister was Dorothy Wyndlow Pattison (\\"Sister Dora\\").Miss W. R. Probert, Walsall's Own 'Lady with the lamp', The Blackcountryman, Spring 2007, Vol. 40, No. 2, p. 51. In 1832, he matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he took his B.A. degree in 1836 with second-class honours. After other attempts to obtain a fellowship, he was elected in 1839 to a Yorkshire fellowship at Lincoln College, Oxford, an anti-Puseyite College. Pattison was at this time a Puseyite, and greatly under the influence of John Henry Newman, for whom he worked, helping in the translation of Thomas Aquinas's Catena Aurea, and writing in the British Critic and Christian Remembrancer. He was ordained priest in 1843, and in the same year became tutor of Lincoln College, where he rapidly made a reputation as a clear and stimulating teacher and as a sympathetic friend of youth. The management of the college was practically in his hands, and his reputation as a scholar became high in the university. In 1851 the rectorship of Lincoln became vacant, and it seemed certain that Pattison would be elected, but he was edged out. The disappointment was acute and his health suffered. In 1855, he resigned the tutorship, travelled to Germany to investigate Continental systems of education, and began his researches into the lives of Isaac Casaubon and Joseph Justus Scaliger, which occupied the remainder of his life. In 1861, he was at last elected Rector of Lincoln College in Oxford, marrying in the same year Emily Francis Strong (afterwards Lady Dilke). As Rector, he contributed largely to various reviews on literary subjects, and took a considerable interest in social science, even presiding over a section at a congress in 1876. However, he avoided the routine of university business, and refused the vice-chancellorship. But while living the life of a student, he was fond of society, and especially of the society of women. He died at Harrogate, Yorkshire. His biography of Isaac Casaubon appeared in 1875; he also wrote about John Milton in Macmillan's \\"English Men of Letters\\" series in 1879. The late nineteenth century English author George Gissing wrote in his diary in 1891 that he 'was astonished to find [the biography of Casaubon] on the shelves' of a circulating library in the small north Somerset seaside resort of Clevedon.Coustillas, {Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist. Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, p.250. The 18th century, alike in its literature and its theology, was a favourite study, as is illustrated by his contribution (Tendencies of Religious Thought in England, 1688‚Äì1750) to the once famous Essays and Reviews (1860), and by his edition of Pope's Essay on Man (1869), etc. His Sermons and Collected Essays, edited by Henry Nettleship, were published posthumously (1889), as well as the Memoirs (1885), an autobiography deeply tinged with melancholy and bitterness.

By the time of Russian colonization in the 17th century, the Yukaghir tribal groups occupied territories from the Lena River to the mouth of the Anadyr River. The number of the Yukaghirs decreased between the 17th and 19th centuries due to epidemics, internecine wars and Tsarist colonial policy which may have included genocide against the sedentary hunter-fisher Anaouls. Some of the Yukaghirs have assimilated with the Yakuts, Evens, and Russians. Currently, Yukaghirs live in the Sakha Republic and the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug of the Russian Federation. According to the 2002 Census, their total number was 1,509 people, up from 1,112 recorded in the 1989 Census. According to the latest 2001 all Ukrainian census, 12 Yukaghirs are living in Ukraine. Only 2 of them indicated Yukaghir as their native language. For the remaining others (6) it is Russian and for 1 it is some other tongue. Subethnic groups Yukaghir shaman, 1902 The 13 tribes that once constituted the Yukaghir group are: Vadul-Alais, Odul, Chuvan, Anaoul, Lavren, Olyuben, Omok, Penjin, Khodynts, Khoromoy, Shoromboy, Yandin, and Yandyr. Genetically, Yukaghirs exhibit roughly equal frequencies of the Y-DNA haplogroups N1c, Q1, and C2 (formerly C3).Investigating the Prehistory of Tungusic Peoples of Siberia and the Amur-Ussuri Region with Complete mtDNA Genome Sequences and Y-chromosomal Markers The surviving three tribes are the Odul of Nelemnoe, the Vadul of Andryushkino and the Chuvan of the Anadyr river area. Of the extinct groups, the most important were the Khodynts, the Anaoul (both of the Anadyr River area), and the Omok (north of the Chuvan). Sometimes the Chuvan are considered a separate tribe. The Chuvantsy language has been extinct since the early 20th century. In 2002, 1,087 identified themselves as Chuvan compared to more than 1,300 in 1989. The Vadul are mainly involved in reindeer herding while the Odul (Kogime) are mostly hunter-gatherers. The Vadul are also known as Tundra Yukaghir. The Odul are also known as Taiga Yukaghir or Kolyma Yukaghir. The Vadul and Odul languages are as different as German is from Dutch. Both are nearing extinction, and Odul is in a much weaker state compared to Vadul. In the 1989 census, more than 700 of the Yukaghirs identified as Vadul while fewer than 400 were Odul. The Yukaghir are one of the oldest peoples in North-Eastern Asia. Originally they lived over a huge territory from Lake Baikal to the Arctic Ocean. By the time of the first encounter with Russians, Yukaghir were divided into twelve tribes with around 9,000 people. The Yukagir ethnonym is Odul or Vadul, which means ‚Äúmighty‚Äù. Tribal divisions among the Yukaghir are fading now, although in every census from 1926, significant number of tribesmen identified themselves with tribal divisions like Anaoul, Odul and Vadul rather than describing themselves as Yukaghir. The Soviet government actively discouraged this tendency and now only the most elderly identify this way. In the 2002 census, out of the 1,509 Yukaghirs, 51 identified themselves as Omok, 40 as Alais, 21 as Odul, 17 as Vadul, 6 as Khangait and 4 as Detkil. =Clan system= The head of every clan was an elder called a Ligey Shomorokh. His was the final word in all aspects of life. Hunting leaders were Khangitche, and war leaders were Tonbaia Shomorokh (\\"the mighty man\\"). Women and teenagers had equal voices with men. The internal life of the community was under the control of the older women. Their decisions in those matters were indisputable. In the beginning of every summer all clans gathered for the Sakhadzibe festival, where mutual Yukaghir questions were discussed. In the Yakut-Sakha Republic there are three nomadic extended family communities. These are Tchaila in Nizhnekolymsky District, Teki Odulok in Verkhnekolymsky District and Ianugail in Ust-Yansky District. The head of Ianugail is I. I. Tomsky. The community's main activities are deer hunting and fishing. Tchaila is the biggest of the three. Its head is S. I. Kurilov. They have 4000 domesticated reindeer, 200 horses, and 20 cows. The community also hunts deer and polar foxes. There is also a shop where traditional skin and fur garments are made. The head of Teki Odulok is N. I. Shalugin. Their base is the village of Nelemnoe. This community is in the most difficult situation. Due to the ‚Äúcreative interpretation‚Äù of various Perestroika and privatization laws by the local and district administration and so-called businessmen, the community has lost all their reindeer, cows and even part of its land. All they have left are about 50 horses. They have no money for supplies for hunting and fishing. 80% of all adult population is de facto unemployed. The highest forum for Yukagir is the all-people gathering Suktuul. Culture The main traditional activity is nomadic and semi-nomadic hunting of deer, moose, wild sheep, and sable, as well as fishing. Reindeer are bred mostly for transportation. Horses are known among the Yukaghir as \\"domestic reindeer of Yakuts\\" (Yoqod ile in Tundra Yukaghir or Yaqad ƒÅ√ß…ô in Kolyma Yukaghir). A Yukaghir house is called a chum. The decline of traditional economic activities, the unfavorable environmental situation of the Yukaghir's traditional lands and waters, and the absence of local and federal laws and executive mechanisms protecting indigenous peoples in Russia, have not aided the welfare and continuation of traditional Yukaghir communities. The average life span for men is 45 years, and 54 years for women. Child mortality is the highest in the Yakut-Sakha Republic. In addition, one expedition made to the Yukaghir found that most had no knowledge of traditional Yukaghir culture. =Language= The Yukaghir languages are a small language family of two closely related languages, Tundra Yukaghir and Kolyma Yukaghir, although there used to be more. They are unclassified languages: their origin and relation to other languages are unknown; some scholars consider them distantly related to the Uralic languages, but this classification is not accepted by the majority of specialists in Uralic linguistics. The languages are regarded as moribund, since less than 370 people can speak either Yukaghir language. Most Yukaghirs today speak Yakut and Russian. =Religion= Alongside Russian Orthodox beliefs, Yukaghirs still practice shamanism. The dominant cults are ancestral spirits, the spirits of Fire, Sun (Pugu), Hunting, Earth, and Water, which can act as protectors or as enemies of people. The most important is the cult of Pugu, the Sun, who is the highest judge in all disputes. The spirits of the dead go to a place called Aibidzi. Every clan had a shaman called an alma. After death every alma was treated as a deity, and the body of the dead alma was dismembered and kept by the clan as relics. The Yukaghir still continue traditions stemming from their origins as nomadic reindeer-hunters: they practice dog sacrifice and have an epic poem based around crows. The animal cult was especially strong in the elk cult. There was a number of rituals and taboos connected with elk and deer hunting.Inside the New Russia (1994): Yukagirs See also *Paleosiberian languages *Uralic‚ÄìYukaghir languages *Uralic *Eurasiatic *Nostratic References=Notes= * Also free online available audio materials (tales, songs). =Footnotes=External links * Yukaghir portal in Arctic Megapedia Modern culture: * Irina Duskulova - \\"ƒåahadan\\" (live) * Irina Duskulova - \\"Ulegen Nume\\" (music video) * Concert @ 5th Yukaghir congress (20 March 2016) Category:Ethnic groups in Russia Category:Ethnic groups in Siberia Category:Indigenous peoples of North Asia Category:Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East Category:Indigenous peoples in the Arctic Category:Hunter-gatherers of Asia Category:Modern nomads Category:Nomadic groups in Eurasia Category:People from Chukotka Autonomous Okrug Category:People from Magadan Oblast Category:People from the Sakha Republic ","title":"Yukaghir people"},{"id":"165722","text":"Timeline Note: The death toll quoted here is just the sum of the listings.

Descended from an old aristocratic family from Brittany, Chateaubriand was a royalist by political disposition. In an age when large numbers of intellectuals turned against the Church, he authored the G√©nie du christianisme in defense of the Catholic faith. His works include the autobiography M√©moires d'Outre-Tombe (\\"Memoirs from Beyond the Grave\\"), published posthumously in 1849‚Äì1850. Historian Peter Gay says that Chateaubriand saw himself as the greatest lover, the greatest writer, and the greatest philosopher of his age. Gay states that Chateaubriand \\"dominated the literary scene in France in the first half of the nineteenth century\\".Peter Gay, \\"The Complete Romantic,\\" Horizon (1966) 8#2 pp 12-19.  Biography = Early years and exile = The ch√¢teau de Combourg, where Chateaubriand spent his childhood Born in Saint-Malo on 4 September 1768, the last of ten children, Chateaubriand grew up at his family's castle (the ch√¢teau de Combourg) in Combourg, Brittany. His father, Ren√© de Chateaubriand (1718‚Äì86), was a former sea captain turned ship owner and slave trader. His mother's maiden name was Apolline de Bed√©e. Chateaubriand's father was a morose, uncommunicative man, and the young Chateaubriand grew up in an atmosphere of gloomy solitude, only broken by long walks in the Breton countryside and an intense friendship with his sister Lucile. His youthful solitude and wild desire produced a suicide attempt with a hunting rifle, although the weapon failed to discharge. Chateaubriand was educated in Dol, Rennes and Dinan. For a time he could not make up his mind whether he wanted to be a naval officer or a priest, but at the age of seventeen, he decided on a military career and gained a commission as a second lieutenant in the French Army based at Navarre. Within two years, he had been promoted to the rank of captain. He visited Paris in 1788 where he made the acquaintance of Jean- Fran√ßois de La Harpe, Andr√© Ch√©nier, Louis-Marcelin de Fontanes and other leading writers of the time. When the French Revolution broke out, Chateaubriand was initially sympathetic, but as events in Paris became more violent he decided to journey to North America in 1791.Nitze, William A. \\"Chateaubriand in America\\", The Dial, Vol. LXV, June‚ÄìDecember 1918. He was given the idea to leave Europe by Guillaume-Chr√©tien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes, who also encouraged him to do some botanical studies.Tapi√©, V.-L. (1965) Chateaubriand. Seuil. = Journey to America = Anne-Louis Girodet (c. 1790) In Voyage en Am√©rique, published in 1826, Chateaubriand writes that he arrived in Philadelphia on 10 July 1791. He visited New York, Boston and Lexington, before leaving by boat on the Hudson River to reach Albany.Chateaubriand, F-R. (1826) Voyage en Am√©rique He then followed the Mohawk Trail up the Niagara Falls where he broke his arm and spent a month in recovery in the company of a Native American tribe. Chateaubriand then describes Native American tribes' customs, as well as zoological, political and economic consideration. He then says that a raid along the Ohio River, the Mississippi River, Louisiana and Florida took him back to Philadelphia, where he embarked on the Molly in November to go back to France. This experience provided the setting for his exotic novels Les Natchez (written between 1793 and 1799 but published only in 1826), Atala (1801) and Ren√© (1802). His vivid, captivating descriptions of nature in the sparsely settled American Deep South were written in a style that was very innovative for the time and spearheaded what later became the Romantic movement in France. As early as 1916,Leb√®gue, R. (1965) Le probl√®me du voyage de Chateaubriand en Am√©rique. Journal des Savants, 1,1 from http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jds_0021-8103_1965_num_1_1_1104 some scholars have cast doubt on Chateaubriand's claims that he was granted an interview with George Washington and that he actually lived for a time with the Native Americans he wrote about. Critics have questioned the veracity of entire sections of Chateaubriand's claimed travels, notably his passage through the Mississippi Valley, Louisiana and Florida. = Return to France = Chateaubriand returned to France in 1792 and subsequently joined the army of Royalist √©migr√©s in Koblenz under the leadership of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√©. Under strong pressure from his family, he married a young aristocratic woman, also from Saint-Malo, whom he had never previously met, C√©leste Buisson de la Vigne (in later life, Chateaubriand was notoriously unfaithful to her, having a series of love affairs). His military career came to an end when he was wounded at the Siege of Thionville, a major clash between Royalist troops (of which Chateaubriand was a member) and the French Revolutionary Army. Half-dead, he was taken to Jersey and exiled to England, leaving his wife behind. = Exile in London = Chateaubriand spent most of his exile in extreme poverty in London, scraping a living offering French lessons and doing translation work, but a stay in Suffolk (Bungay) proved to be more idyllic. Here Chateaubriand fell in love with a young English woman, Charlotte Ives, but the romance ended when he was forced to reveal he was already married. During his time in Britain, Chateaubriand also became familiar with English literature. This reading, particularly of John Milton's Paradise Lost (which he later translated into French prose), had a deep influence on his own literary work. His exile forced Chateaubriand to examine the causes of the French Revolution, which had cost the lives of many of his family and friends; these reflections inspired his first work, Essai sur les R√©volutions (1797). An attempt in 18th-century style to explain the French Revolution, it predated his subsequent, romantic style of writing and was largely ignored. A major turning point in Chateaubriand's life was his conversion back to the Catholic faith of his childhood around 1798. =Consulate and Empire= Chateaubriand took advantage of the amnesty issued to √©migr√©s to return to France in May 1800 (under the French Consulate); Chateaubriand edited the Mercure de France. In 1802, he won fame with G√©nie du christianisme (\\"The Genius of Christianity\\"), an apologia for the Catholic faith which contributed to the post-revolutionary religious revival in France. It also won him the favour of Napoleon Bonaparte, who was eager to win over the Catholic Church at the time. James McMillan argues that a Europe-wide Catholic Revival emerged from the change in intellectual climate from intellectually-oriented classicism to emotionally-based Romanticism. He concludes that Chateaubriand's book: :did more than any other single work to restore the credibility and prestige of Christianity in intellectual circles and launched a fashionable rediscovery of the Middle Ages and their Christian civilisation. The revival was by no means confined to an intellectual elite, however, but was evident in the real, if uneven, rechristianisation of the French countryside.James McMillan, \\"Catholic Christianity in France from the Restoration to the separation of church and state, 1815-1905.\\" in Sheridan Gilley and Brian Stanley, eds., The Cambridge history of Christianity (2014) 8: 217-232 Appointed secretary of the legation to the Holy See by Napoleon, he accompanied Cardinal Fesch to Rome. But the two men soon quarrelled and Chateaubriand was nominated as minister to Valais (in Switzerland). He resigned his post in disgust after Napoleon ordered the execution in 1804 of Louis XVI's cousin, Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond√©, duc d'Enghien. Chateaubriand was, after his resignation, completely dependent on his literary efforts. However, and quite unexpectedly, he received a large sum of money from the Russian Tsarina Elizabeth Alexeievna. She had seen him as a defender of Christianity and thus worthy of her royal support. Chateaubriand used his new-found wealth in 1806 to visit Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, Egypt, Tunisia, and Spain. The notes he made on his travels later formed part of a prose epic, Les Martyrs, set during the Roman persecution of early Christianity. His notes also furnished a running account of the trip itself, published in 1811 as the Itin√©raire de Paris √† J√©rusalem (Itinerary from Paris to Jerusalem). The Spanish stage of the journey inspired a third novella, Les aventures du dernier Abenc√©rage (The Adventures of the Last Abencerrage), which appeared in 1826. On his return to France at the end of 1806, he published a severe criticism of Napoleon, comparing him to Nero and predicting the emergence of a new Tacitus. Napoleon famously threatened to have Chateaubriand sabred on the steps of the Tuileries Palace for it, but settled for merely banishing him from the city. Chateaubriand therefore retired, in 1807, to a modest estate he called Vall√©e-aux-Loups (\\"Wolf Valley\\"), in Ch√¢tenay-Malabry, south of central Paris, where he lived until 1817. Here he finished Les Martyrs, which appeared in 1809, and began the first drafts of his M√©moires d‚ÄôOutre-Tombe. He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1811, but, given his plan to infuse his acceptance speech with criticism of the Revolution, he could not occupy his seat until after the Bourbon Restoration. His literary friends during this period included Madame de Sta√´l, Joseph Joubert and Pierre-Simon Ballanche. = Under the Restoration = Peer of France (1828) Chateaubriand became a major figure in politics as well as literature. At first he was a strong Royalist in the period up to 1824. His liberal phase lasted from 1824 to 1830. After that he was much less active. After the fall of Napoleon, Chateaubriand rallied to the Bourbons. On 30 March 1814, he wrote a pamphlet against Napoleon, titled De Buonaparte et des Bourbons, of which thousands of copies were published. He then followed Louis XVIII into exile to Ghent during the Hundred Days (March‚ÄìJuly 1815), and was nominated ambassador to Sweden. After Napoleon's final defeat in the Battle of Waterloo (of which he heard the distant cannon rumblings outside Ghent), Chateaubriand became peer of France and state minister (1815). In December 1815 he voted for Marshal Ney's execution. However, his criticism of King Louis XVIII in La Monarchie selon la Charte, after the Chambre introuvable was dissolved, got him disgraced. He lost his function of state minister, and joined the opposition, siding with the Ultra-royalist group supporting the future Charles X, and becoming one of the main writers of its mouthpiece, Le Conservateur. Chateaubriand sided again with the Court after the murder of the Duc de Berry (1820), writing for the occasion the M√©moires sur la vie et la mort du duc. He then served as ambassador to Prussia (1821) and the United Kingdom (1822), and even rose to the office of Minister of Foreign Affairs (28 December 1822 ‚Äì 4 August 1824). A plenipotentiary to the Congress of Verona (1822), he decided in favor of the Quintuple Alliance's intervention in Spain during the Trienio Liberal, despite opposition from the Duke of Wellington. Chateaubriand was soon relieved of his office by Prime Minister Joseph de Vill√®le on 5 June 1824, over his objections to a law the latter proposed that would have resulted in the widening of the electorate. Chateaubriand was subsequently appointed French ambassador to Genoa. Consequently, he moved towards the liberal opposition, both as a Peer and as a contributor to Journal des D√©bats (his articles there gave the signal of the paper's similar switch, which, however, was more moderate than Le National, directed by Adolphe Thiers and Armand Carrel). Opposing Vill√®le, he became highly popular as a defender of press freedom and the cause of Greek independence. After Vill√®le's downfall, Charles X appointed Chateaubriand ambassador to the Holy See in 1828, but he resigned upon the accession of the Prince de Polignac as premier (November 1829). In 1830, he donated a monument to the French painter Nicolas Poussin in the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina in Rome. = July Monarchy = His last home, 120 rue du Bac, where Chateaubriand had an apartment on the ground floor In 1830, after the July Revolution, his refusal to swear allegiance to the new House of Orl√©ans king Louis-Philippe put an end to his political career. He withdrew from political life to write his M√©moires d'Outre-Tombe (\\"Memoirs from Beyond the Grave\\"), published posthumously in two volumes in 1849‚Äì1850. It reflects his growing pessimism regarding the future. Although his contemporaries celebrated the present and future as an extension of the past, Chateaubriand and the new Romanticists couldn‚Äôt share their nostalgic outlook. Instead he foresaw chaos, discontinuity, and disaster. His diaries and letters often focused on the upheavals he could see every day ‚Äî abuses of power, excesses of daily life, and disasters yet to come. His melancholy tone suggested astonishment, surrender, betrayal, and bitterness.Peter Fritzsche, \\"Chateaubriand's Ruins: Loss and Memory after the French Revolution.\\" History and Memory 10.2 (1998): 102-117. onlinePeter Fritzsche, \\"Specters of history: On nostalgia, exile, and modernity.\\" American Historical Review 106.5 (2001): 1587-1618. His √âtudes historiques was an introduction to a projected History of France. He became a harsh critic of the \\"bourgeois king\\" Louis-Philippe and the July Monarchy, and his planned volume on the arrest of Marie-Caroline, duchesse de Berry caused him to be (unsuccessfully) prosecuted. Chateaubriand, along with other Catholic traditionalists such as Ballanche or, on the other side of the political divide, the socialist and republican Pierre Leroux, was one of the few men of his time who attempted to conciliate the three terms of Libert√©, √©galit√© and fraternit√©, going beyond the antagonism between liberals and socialists as to what interpretation to give the seemingly contradictory terms. Chateaubriand thus gave a Christian interpretation of the revolutionary motto, stating in the 1841 conclusion to his M√©moires d'Outre-Tombe: In his final years, he lived as a recluse in an apartment at 120 rue du Bac, Paris, leaving his house only to pay visits to Juliette R√©camier in Abbaye-aux-Bois. His final work, Vie de Ranc√©, was written at the suggestion of his confessor and published in 1844. It is a biography of Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Ranc√©, a worldly seventeenth-century French aristocrat who withdrew from society to become the founder of the Trappist order of monks. The parallels with Chateaubriand's own life are striking. As late as 1845-1847, he also kept revising M√©moires d‚ÄôOutre-Tombe, particularly the earlier sections, as evidenced by the revision dates on the manuscript. Chateaubriand died in Paris on 4 July 1848, in the midst of the Revolution of 1848, in the arms of his dear friend Juliette R√©camier,https://archive.org/details/chateaubriandhis00grib/page/344/mode/2up and was buried, as he had requested, on the tidal island Grand B√© near Saint- Malo, accessible only when the tide is out.  Influence  His descriptions of Nature and his analysis of emotion made him the model for a generation of Romantic writers, not only in France but also abroad. For example, Lord Byron was deeply impressed by Ren√©. The young Victor Hugo scribbled in a notebook, \\"To be Chateaubriand or nothing.\\" Even his enemies found it hard to avoid his influence. Stendhal, who despised him for political reasons, made use of his psychological analyses in his own book, De l'amour. Chateaubriand was the first to define the vague des passions (\\"intimations of passion\\") that later became a commonplace of Romanticism: \\"One inhabits, with a full heart, an empty world\\" (G√©nie du Christianisme). His political thought and actions seem to offer numerous contradictions: he wanted to be the friend both of legitimist royalty and of republicans, alternately defending whichever of the two seemed more in danger: \\"I am a Bourbonist out of honour, a monarchist out of reason, and a republican out of taste and temperament\\". He was the first of a series of French men of letters (Lamartine, Victor Hugo, Andr√© Malraux, Paul Claudel) who tried to mix political and literary careers. \\"We are convinced that the great writers have told their own story in their works\\", wrote Chateaubriand in G√©nie du christianisme. \\"One only truly describes one's own heart by attributing it to another, and the greater part of genius is composed of memories\\". This is certainly true of Chateaubriand himself. All his works have strong autobiographical elements, overt or disguised. George Brandes, in 1901, compared the works of Chateaubriand to those of Rousseau and others: > The year 1800 was the first to produce a book bearing the imprint of the new > era, a work small in size, but great in significance and mighty in the > impression it made. Atala took the French public by storm in a way which no > book had done since the days of Paul and Virginia. It was a romance of the > plains and mysterious forests of North America, with a strong, strange aroma > of the untilled soil from which it sprang; it glowed with rich foreign > colouring, and with the fiercer glow of consuming passion.George Brandes, > Main Currents in Nineteenth Century Literature, 1:The Emigrant Literature p. > 7 Chateaubriand was a food enthusiast; Chateaubriand steak is most likely to have been named after him.see the Chateaubriand steak article for discussion Honors and memberships Chateaubriand was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1816.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory A French school in Rome (Italy) is named after him.

Biography Yates was born in Manchester, the eldest of five children (and only son) of seed merchant Percy Yates and his wife Edith. He attended Wadham House, a private school, before gaining a scholarship to Clifton College in 1916. In 1920 he obtained a scholarship at St John's College, Cambridge and four years later graduated with a First Class Honours degree. He spent two years teaching mathematics to secondary school pupils at Malvern College before heading to Africa where he was mathematical advisor on the Gold Coast Survey. He returned to England due to ill health and met and married a chemist, Margaret Forsythe Marsden, the daughter of a civil servant. This marriage was dissolved in 1933 and he later married Prascovie (Pauline) Tchitchkine, previously the partner of Alexis Tchitchkine. After her death in 1976, he married Ruth Hunt, his long-time secretary. In 1931 Yates was appointed assistant statistician at Rothamsted Experimental Station by R.A. Fisher. In 1933 he became head of statistics when Fisher went to University College London. At Rothamsted he worked on the design of experiments, including contributions to the theory of analysis of variance and originating Yates's algorithm and the balanced incomplete block design. During World War II he worked on what would later be called operations research. After WWII, he worked on sample survey design and analysis. He became an enthusiast of electronic computers, in 1954 obtaining an Elliott 401 for Rothamsted and contributing to the initial development of statistical computing. During 1960‚Äì61, he was President of the British Computer Society, succeeding the founding president and computer pioneer, Maurice Wilkes. In 1960, he was awarded the Guy Medal in Gold of the Royal Statistical Society and, in 1966, he was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society. He retired from Rothamsted to become a senior research fellow at Imperial College London. He died in 1994, aged 92, in Harpenden.

It flows through Bangkok and then into the Gulf of Thailand. Etymology On many old European maps, the river is named the Menam or Mae Nam (Thai: ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥), which is simply the Thai word for \\"river\\". James McCarthy, F.R.G.S., who served as Director-General of the Siamese Government Surveys prior to establishment of the Royal Survey Department, wrote in his account, \\"Me Nam is a generic term, me signifying \\"mother\\" and Nam \\"water,\\" and the epithet Chao P'ia signifies that it is the chief river in the kingdom of Siam.\\" H. Warington Smyth, who served as Director of the Department of Mines in Siam from 1891 to 1896, refers to it in his book first published in 1898 as \\"the Me Nam Chao Phraya\\". In the English-language media in Thailand, the name Chao Phraya River is often translated as river of kings. Chao Phraya River, Bangkok Geography The Chao Phraya begins at the confluence of the Ping and Nan rivers at Nakhon Sawan (also called Pak Nam Pho) in Nakhon Sawan Province. After this it flows south for from the central plains to Bangkok and the Gulf of Thailand. In Chai Nat, the river then splits into the main course and the Tha Chin River, which then flows parallel to the main river and exits in the Gulf of Thailand about west of Bangkok in Samut Sakhon. In the low alluvial plain which begins below the Chainat Dam, there are many small canals (khlong) which split off from the main river. The khlongs are used for the irrigation of the region's rice paddies. Night view of Bangkok Chao Phraya River The rough coordinates of the river are 13 N, 100 E. This area has a wet monsoon climate, with over of rainfall per year. Temperatures range from in Bangkok. =River engineering= The original course of the river and its shortcut canals The lower Chao Phraya underwent several man-made modifications during the Ayutthaya period. Several shortcut canals were constructed to bypass large loops in the river, shortening the trip from the capital city to the sea. The course of the river has since changed to follow many of these canals. * In 1538, Thailand's first river engineering of a long canal was dug at the order of King Chairachathirat. It was called \\"Khlong Lat\\", and today forms a part of Khlong Bangkok Noi. It shortened the route by 13‚Äì14 km for ships from the Gulf of Siam to the then-capital city, Ayutthaya.Steve Van Beek: The Chao Phya, p.39 * In 1542, a two kilometer-long canal, \\"Khlong Lat Bangkok\\", was completed. The Chao Phraya then diverted along the new canal, its old course becoming part of Khlong Bangkok Noi and Khlong Bangkok Yai. It is said to have shortened the river route by . * In 1608, a seven kilometer-long \\"Khlong Bang Phrao\\" canal was completed and has shortened the Chao Phraya's original route by . * In 1636, the \\"Khlong Lat Mueang Nonthaburi\\" was completed. * In 1722, the two kilometre long \\"Khlong Lat Kret Noi\\" shortened the Chao Phraya by . This route formed the island of Ko Kret. River settlements Cities along the Chao Phraya include, from north to south, Nakhon Sawan Province, Uthai Thani Province, Chai Nat Province, Sing Buri Province, Ang Thong Province, Ayutthaya Province, Pathum Thani Province, Nonthaburi Province, Bangkok, and Samut Prakan Province. These cities are among the most historically significant and densely populated settlements of Thailand due to their access to the waterway. Transportation Chao Phraya River Chao Phraya River Food Vendor Chao Phraya River Food Vendor Major bridges cross the Chao Phraya in Bangkok: the Rama VI railroad bridge; Phra Pin-klao near the Grand Palace; Rama VIII, a single tower asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge; Rama IX, a semi-symmetric cable-stayed bridge; and Mega Bridge, on the Industrial Ring Road. In Bangkok, the Chao Phraya is a major transportation artery for a network of river buses, cross- river ferries, and water taxis (\\"longtails\\"). More than 15 boat lines operate on the rivers and canals of the city, including commuter lines. Tributaries The principal tributaries of the Chao Phraya River are the Pa Sak River, the Sakae Krang River, the Nan River (along with its principal confluent the Yom River), the Ping River (with its principal confluent, the Wang River), and the Tha Chin River. Each of these tributaries (and the Chao Phraya itself) is augmented by minor tributaries referred to as khwae. All of the tributaries, including the lesser khwae, form an extensive tree-like pattern, with branches flowing through nearly every province in central and northern Thailand. None of the tributaries of the Chao Phraya extend beyond the nation's borders.Google Earth The Nan and the Yom River flow nearly parallel from Phitsanulok to Chumsaeng in the north of Nakhon Sawan Province. The Wang River enters the Ping River near Sam Ngao district in Tak Province. Chao Phraya watershed China House on the Chao Phraya River The expanse of the Chao Phraya River and its tributaries, i.e., the Chao Phraya river system, together with the land upon which falling rain drains into these bodies of water, form the Chao Phraya watershed.River and Watershed Facts on the Chao Phraya The Chao Phraya watershed is the largest watershed in Thailand, covering approximately 35 percent of the nation's land, and draining an area of .Basins of Thailand The watershed is divided into the following basins: *Pa Sak Basin *Sakae Krang Basin *Greater Nan Basin (composed of the Nan Basin and the Yom Basin, and usually divided as such in drainage analyses) *Greater Ping Basin (composed of the Ping Basin and the Wang Basin, and usually divided as such in drainage analyses) *Tha Chin Basin (the basin of the Chao Phraya's most significant distributaries) *Finally the Chao Phraya Basin itself is defined as the portion of the Chao Phraya watershed drained by the Chao Phraya River itself, and not by its major tributaries or distributaries. As such, the Chao Phraya Basin drains of land. To the west, the central plain of Thailand is drained by the Mae Klong and the east by the Bang Pakong River. They are not part of the Chao Praya system. Iconsiam on Chao Phraya River bank The landscape of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area with an average of two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when rice growing intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855. Delta The mouth of Chao Phraya River. The Tha Chin River is the major distributary of the Chao Phraya River. The expanse of the Chao Phraya and Tha Chin Rivers and their distributaries, starting at the point at which the distributaries diverge, together with the land amid the triangle formed by the outermost and innermost distributary, form the Chao Phraya delta. The many distributaries of the Chao Phraya delta are interconnected by canals that serve both for irrigation and for transportation. Ecology Wat Arun, viewed from Chao Phraya River The lowland areas of the Chao Phraya watershed in central Thailand have been designated as the Chao Phraya freshwater swamp forests, a tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests ecoregion, an area about north to south and wide. The original swamp forests have almost entirely been removed as the plain has been converted to rice paddies, other agriculture, and urban areas like Bangkok. Much of the wildlife that once inhabited these plains has disappeared, including a large number of fish in the river systems, birds such as vultures, the Oriental darter (Anhinga melanogaster), white-eyed river martin (Pseudochelidon sirintarae), the sarus crane (Grus antigone)Madoc, G. 1950. Field Notes on some Siamese Birds. Bull. Raffles Mus. 23: 129‚Äì190. and animals such as tigers, Asian elephants, Javan rhinoceroses, and the much- hunted Schomburgk's deer.IUCN 1991. The Conservation Atlas of Tropical Forests: Asia and the Pacific. London and Basingstoke: Macmillan Press Ltd. Today we can only guess at the original habitat and wildlife by comparing it with neighbouring countries. It is believed that the area would have consisted of freshwater swamps inland and salty mangroves on the coast and the river estuaries. The swamp would have been covered in Phragmites marsh grasses. Today there is a small area of this remaining in Khao Sam Roi Yot National Park, a relic of the original landscape. As so much has been cleared or altered the potential for creating large protected areas to preserve original habitat no longer exists. However much wildlife does remain in the rice fields and steps may be taken to preserve these as urban and industrial development on the plains is ongoing and the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand has very little control or planning over this. Particular threats come from the conversion of rice paddies to large-scale production of prawns by pumping in seawater, and the use of pesticides to eliminate the introduced snail,Pomacea canaliculata, which damages rice plants. There are populations of threatened birds, including colonies of breeding water birds such as the world's largest populations of the near-threatened Asian openbill (Anastomus oscitans), and other birds such as the wintering black kite (Milvus migrans). Endemic mammals that remain are the limestone rat (Niviventer hinpoon), Neill's long-tailed giant rat (Leopoldamys neilli), and the near-endemic Thailand roundleaf bat (Hipposideros halophyllus). The Chao Phraya basin is home to about half a dozen endemic dragonflies and damselflies. The conservation status of most of these in unclear (they are rated as data deficient by the IUCN), but Cryptophaea saukra is critically endangered and Caliphaea angka is endangered.Allen, D.J.; Smith, K.G. & Darwall, W.R.T. (editors)(2008). The status and distribution of freshwater fishes of Indo-Burma. IUCN. . There are few areas of wetland protected as national parks, but these are mostly very small. =Fish= The giant barb is one of the world's largest freshwater fish weighing up to , but the natural population has been extirpated from Chao Phraya. The Chao Phraya basin is home to around 280 species of fish, including about 30 endemics.Freshwater Ecoregions of the World (2013). Chao Phraya . Retrieved 7 March 2015. By far the most diverse family is Cyprinidae with 108 species. The mainstream of the Chao Phraya River has about 190 native fish species. In general, the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong show clear similarities, and they are sometimes combined in a single ecoregion with 328 fish species. Despite their similarities, there are also differences between the aquatic fauna of Chao Phraya and Mae Klong; the latter (but not the former) is home to a few taxa otherwise only known in major Burmese rivers: the Irrawaddy, Salween, and Tenasserim. The aquatic fauna in Chao Phraya‚ÄìMae Klong also show clear similarities with that of the middle Mekong (the lower Mekong fauna more closely resembles that of the eastern Malay Peninsula). It is believed that the upper Mekong was connected to Chao Phraya (rather than present-day lower Mekong) until the Quaternary, which explains the similarities in their river faunas. This included the Nan River basin, a tributary of the Chao Phraya, which is home to a number of taxa (for example, Ambastaia nigrolineata and Sectoria) otherwise only known from Mekong. Of the fish species known from the Chao Phraya‚ÄìMae Klong, only about 50 are absent from the Mekong. The only remaining wild population of the red-tailed black shark is restricted to an area of less than . There has been extensive habitat destruction (pollution, dams, and drainage for irrigation) in the Chao Phraya basin and overfishing also presents a problem.Samorn Muttamara, S. & Sales, C. L.

Tropical Deltas and Coastal Zones: Food Production, Communities and Environment at the Land-water Interface. . Within mainland Southeast Asia, the only freshwater region with similar high levels of threat is the lower Mekong. It has been estimated that only around 30 native fish species still are able to reproduce in the mainstream of the Chao Phraya River. The catfish Platytropius siamensis is endemic to Chao Phraya and Bang Pakong, but has not been recorded since the 1970s and is considered extinct. Recent records of the near-endemic cyprinid Balantiocheilos ambusticauda are also lacking and it is possibly extinct. Three of the largest freshwater fish in the world are native to the river, but these are all seriously threatened: the critically endangered giant barb (wild populations have been extirpated from Chao Phraya, but remain elsewhere), critically endangered giant pangasius, and endangered giant freshwater stingray. The critically endangered red-tailed black shark, a small colourful cyprinid that is endemic to Chao Phraya, is commonly seen in the aquarium trade where it is bred in large numbers, but the only remaining wild population is at a single location that covers less than . The endangered dwarf loach, another species bred in large numbers for the aquarium trade, has been extirpated from most of its range in Chao Phraya. The critically endangered Siamese tigerfish has been entirely exirpated from Chao Phraya and Mae Klong, but small populations remain in the Mekong basin. Basa fish from the Chao Phraya and Mekong is an important food fish, and it is also farmed. Many other species that either are prominent in the aquarium trade or important food fish are native to the Chao Phraya basin, such as the climbing perch, blue panchax, Asian bumblebee catfish, giant snakehead, striped snakehead, walking catfish, banded loach, several Yasuhikotakia loaches, tinfoil barb, Siamese algae eater, silver barb, pearl danio, rainbow shark, Hampala barb, black sharkminnow, Leptobarbus rubripinna, long pectoral-fin minnow, bonylip barb, Jullien's golden carp, blackline rasbora, scissortail rasbora, Tor tambroides, finescale tigerfish, marble goby, Chinese algae eater, giant featherback, clown featherback, giant gourami, several Trichopodus gouramis, iridescent shark, several Pangasius, Belodontichthys truncatus, several Phalacronotus sheatfish, several Wallago catfish, largescale archerfish, smallscale archerfish, and wrestling halfbeak.FishBase: Fish Species in Chao Phraya River. Retrieved 7 March 2015. =Pollution= The Thai Pollution Control Department (PCD) reports that the water quality of major rivers flowing into the upper Gulf of Thailand has seriously deteriorated in the past decade. The department found the lower Chao Phraya contains bacteria and nutrient pollution from phosphates, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Nutrient pollution causes algae to grow faster than ecosystems can handle, harming water quality, food resources for aquatic animals, and marine habitats. It also decreases the oxygen that fish need to survive. PCD rated water quality at the mouth of Chao Phraya at Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian District as \\"very poor\\", worse than in 2014. PCD findings indicated large amounts of wastewater were discharged into the river from households, industry, and agriculture.

This is the largest land area retained by an indigenous tribe in the United States, with a population of 173,667 as of 2010. By area, the Navajo Nation is larger than ten U.S. statesWest Virginia, Maryland, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Islandand is less than one percent shy of being equal to the combined area of the last five (New Hampshire through Rhode Island). The original territory has expanded several times since the 19th century. Terminology In English, the official name for the area was \\"Navajo Indian Reservation\\", as outlined in Article II of the 1868 Treaty of Bosque Redondo. On April 15, 1969, the tribe changed its official name to the Navajo Nation, which is also displayed on the seal. Wilkins, David Eugene. The Navajo Political Experience. Din√© College Pres. Tsaile/Ts√©h√≠lƒØÃÅ: 1999. p. 3 In 1994, the Tribal Council rejected a proposal to change the official designation from \\"Navajo\\" to \\"Din√©.\\" It was remarked that the name Din√© represented the time of suffering before the Long Walk, and that Navajo is the appropriate designation for the future.Brenda Norell, \\"Navajo oppose name change,\\" Indian Country Today, 12 January 1994 In Navajo, the geographic entity with its legally defined borders is known as \\"\\". This contrasts with \\"\\" and \\"\\" for the general idea of \\"Navajoland\\".Young, Robert W & William Morgan, Sr. The Navajo Language. A Grammar and Colloquial Dictionary, Albuquerque, NM: University of New Mexico Press, 1987. Neither of these terms should be confused with \\",\\" the term used for the traditional homeland of the Navajo, which is situated in the area among the four sacred Navajo mountains of ' (San Francisco Peaks), ' (Hesperus Mountain), ' (Blanca Peak), and ' (Mount Taylor). History The Navajo people's tradition of governance is rooted in their clans and oral history. The clan system of the Din√© is integral to their society, as the rules of behavior found within the system extend to the manner of refined culture that the Navajo people call \\"to walk in Beauty\\". The philosophy and clan system extend from before the Spanish colonial occupation of Dinetah, through to the July 25, 1868, Congressional ratification of the Navajo Treaty with President Andrew Johnson, signed by Barboncito, Armijo, and other chiefs and headmen present at Bosque Redondo. The Navajo people have continued to transform their conceptual understandings of government since it joined the United States by the Treaty of 1868. Social, cultural and political academics continue to debate the nature of the modern Navajo governance and how it has evolved to include the systems and economies of the \\"western world\\". =Reservation and expansion= Aerial view looking south across Arizona's Painted Desert with part of the Navajo Reservation in the foreground In the mid-19th century, most Navajo were forced from their lands by the US government, and were marched on the Long Walk to imprisonment in Bosque Redondo. The Treaty of 1868 established the \\"Navajo Indian Reservation\\" and the Navajos left Bosque Redondo. The borders were defined as the 37th parallel in the north; the southern border as a line running through Fort Defiance; the eastern border as a line running through Fort Lyon; and in the west as longitude 109¬∞30‚Ä≤. As drafted in 1868, the boundaries were defined as: Border changes and expansions of the Navajo Reservation from 1868 to 1934 Though the treaty had provided for one hundred miles by one hundred miles in the New Mexico Territory, the size of the territory was ‚Äîslightly more than half. This initial piece of land is represented in the design of the Navajo Nation's flag by a dark-brown rectangle. As no physical boundaries or signposts were set in place, many Navajo ignored these formal boundaries and returned to where they had been living prior to captivity. A significant number of Navajo had never lived in the Hw√©eldi (near Fort Sumner). They remained or moved to near the Little Colorado and Colorado rivers, on Naatsis º√°√°n (Navajo Mountain) and some with Apache bands. The first expansion of the territory occurred on October 28, 1878, when President Rutherford Hayes signed an executive order pushing the reservation boundary 20 miles to the west. Further additions followed throughout the late 19th and early 20th century (see map). Most of these additions were achieved through executive orders, some of which were confirmed by acts of Congress; for example, President Theodore Roosevelt's executive order to add the region around Aneth, Utah in 1905 was confirmed by Congress in 1933.\\"Hubbell Trading Post. Site History\\", National Park Service, Accessed 2010-11-05. 1904 photograph of a young Navajo man. The eastern border was shaped primarily as a result of allotments of land to individual Navajo households under the Dawes Act of 1887. This experiment was designed to assimilate Native Americans to the majority culture. The federal government proposed to divide communal lands into plots assignable to heads of household ‚Äì tribal members ‚Äì for their subsistence farming, in the pattern of small family farms common among European Americans. The land allocated to Navajos was initially not considered as part of the reservation. Further, the government determined that land \\"left over\\" after all members had received allotments was to be considered \\"surplus\\" and available for sale to non-Native Americans. The allotment program continued until 1934. Today, this patchwork of reservation and non-reservation land is called \\"the checkerboard\\" area.Wilkins, David Eugene. The Navajo Political Experience. Din√© College Press. Tsaile/Ts√©h√≠lƒØÃÅ: 1999. page 58. In the southeastern area of the reservation, the Navajo Nation has purchased some ranches, which it calls its Nahata Dzil or New Lands. They are leased to Navajo individuals, livestock and grazing associations, and livestock companies. In 1996, Elouise Cobell (Blackfeet) filed a class action suit against the federal government on behalf of an estimated 250,000‚Äì500,000 plaintiffs, Native Americans whose trust accounts did not reflect an accurate accounting of monies owed them under leases or fees on trust lands. The settlement of Cobell v. Salazar in 2009 included a provision for a nearly $2 billion fund for the government to buy fractionated interests and restore land to tribal reservations. Individuals could sell their fractionated land interests on a voluntary basis, at market rates, through this program if their tribe participated. Through March 2017, under the Tribal Nations Buy-Back Program, individual Navajo members received $104 million for purchase of their interests in land; 155,503 acres were returned to the Navajo Nation for its territory by the Department of Interior under this program. The program is intended to help tribes restore the land bases of their reservations. Almost 11,000 Navajo citizens were paid for their interests under this program. The tribe intends to use the consolidated lands to \\"streamline infrastructure projects,\\" such as running power lines. =Clan governance= In the traditional Navajo culture, local leadership was organized around clans, which are matrilineal kinship groups. Children are considered born into the mother's family and gain their social status from her. The clan leadership have served as a de facto government on the local level of the Navajo Nation. Rejection of Indian Reorganization Act In 1933 during the Great Depression, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) attempted to mitigate environmental damage due to over-grazing on reservations. This created an environment of misunderstanding, as its representatives did not consult sufficiently with the Navajo. BIA Superintendent John Collier's attempt to reduce livestock herd size affected responses to his other efforts to improve conditions for Native Americans, as the herds were central to Navajo culture, and were a source of prestige. Also during this period, under the Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934, the federal government was encouraging tribes to revive their governments according to constitutional models shaped after the United States. Because of the outrage and discontent about the herd issues, the Navajo voters did not trust the language of the proposed initial constitution outlined in the legislation. This contributed to their rejection of the first version of a proposed tribal constitution. In the various attempts since, members found the process to be too cumbersome and a potential threat to tribal self-determination, as the constitution was supposed to be reviewed and approved by BIA. The earliest efforts were rejected primarily because segments of the tribe did not find enough freedom in the proposed forms of government. In 1935 they feared that the proposed government would hinder development and recovery of their livestock industries; in 1953 they worried about restrictions on development of mineral resources. They continued a government based on traditional models, with headmen chosen by clan groups. Navajo Nation and federal government jurisdictions , the \\"Window Rock\\" The United States still asserts plenary power and thus requires the territory of the Navajo Nation to submit all proposed laws to the United States Secretary of the Interior for Secretarial Review, through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The US Supreme Court in United States v. Kagama (1889) affirmed that Congress has plenary power over all Indian tribes within United States borders, saying that \\"The power of the general government over these remnants of a race once powerful ... is necessary to their protection as well as to the safety of those among whom they dwell\\". It noted that the tribes did not owe allegiance to the states within which their reservations were located. Most conflicts and controversies between the federal government of the United States and the Nation are settled by negotiations outlined in political agreements. The Navajo Nation Code comprises the rules and laws of the Navajo Nation as currently codified in the latest edition. Lands within the exterior boundaries of the Navajo Nation are composed of Public, Tribal Trust, Tribal Fee, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Private, State, and BIA Indian Allotment Lands. On the Arizona and Utah portions of the Navajo Nation, there are a few private and BIA Indian Allotments in comparison to New Mexico's portion which consists of a checkerboard pattern of all the aforementioned lands. The Eastern Agency, as it is referred to, consists of primarily Tribal Fee, BIA Indian Allotments, and BLM Lands. Although there are more Tribal Fee Lands in New Mexico, the Navajo Nation government intends to convert most or all Tribal Fee Lands to Tribal Trust. Government Vice President Myron Lizer, Congressman Tom O'Halleran and President Jonathan Nez in 2020. The Title II Amendment of 1989 established the Navajo Nation government as a three-part system (changes to the judicial branch had already begun in 1958). Two branches are independent of the council (where all government decision making was centralized before the change). The president and vice-president are elected every four years. The Executive nominates judges of the District Courts, and the Supreme Court. The nation consists of several divisions, departments, offices, and programs as established by law.2 Navajo Nation Code ¬ß¬ß 1001, 1002, 1003, 1005 (1995) =Constitution= In 2006, a committee for a \\"Navajo constitution\\" began advocating for a Navajo constitutional convention. The committee's goal was to have representation from every chapter on the Navajo Nation represented at a constitutional convention. The committee proposed the convention be held in the traditional naachid/modern chapter house format, where every member of the nation wishing to participate may do so through their home chapters. The committee was formed by former Navajo leaders: Kelsey Begaye, Peterson Zah, Peter MacDonald, writer/social activist Ivan Gamble, and other local political activists.Lee, Tanya. \\"Navajo group begins process of crafting a constitution\\", Indian Country Today. 19 June 2006 (retrieved 5 Oct 2009) =Judiciary branch= Prior to Long Walk of the Navajo, judicial powers were exercised by peace chiefs () in a mediation-style process.Yazzie, Robert (11 February 2003) \\"History of the Courts of the Navajo Nation\\", Navajo Nation Museum, Library & Visitor Center, archived 3 November 2010 at FreezePage While the people were held at Bosque Redondo, the U.S. Army handled severe crimes while lesser crimes and disputes remained in the purview of the villages' chiefs. After the Navajo return from Bosque Redondo in 1868, listed offenses were handled by the Indian Agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs with support of the U.S. Army while lesser disputes remained under Navajo control. In 1892, BIA Agent David L. Shipley established the Navajo Court of Indian Offenses and appointed judges.Austin, Raymond Darrel (2009), \\"The Navajo Nation court system\\", pp. 1‚Äì36, page 21 In Austin, Raymond Darrel (2009) Navajo Courts and Navajo Common Law: A Tradition of Tribal Self-Governance, University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, Minnesota, Previously, judicial authority was exercised by the Indian Agent. In 1950, the Navajo Tribal Council decided that judges should be elected. By the time of the judicial reorganization of 1958, the council had determined that, due to problems with delayed decisions and partisan politics, appointment was a better method of selecting judges.\\"Former justice, legal historian lists problems with electing judges\\", Navajo Times 29 October 2010, last accessed 3 November 2010 The president makes appointments subject to confirmation by the Navajo Nation Council; however, the president is limited to the list of names vetted by the Judiciary Committee of the council.French, Laurence (2002) Native American Justice, Burnham, Chicago, page 151, The current judicial system for the Navajo Nation was created by the Navajo Tribal Council on 16 October 1958. It established a separate branch of government, the \\"Judicial Branch of the Navajo Nation Government\\", which became effective 1 April 1959.Navajo Tribal Council Resolution No. CO-69-58 (16 October 1958) The Navajo Court of Indian Offenses was eliminated; the sitting judges became judges in the new system. The resolution established \\"Trial Courts of the Navajo Tribe\\" and the \\"Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals\\", which was the highest court and the only appellate court. In 1978, the Navajo Tribal Council established a \\"Supreme Judicial Council\\", a political body rather than a court. On a discretionary basis, it could hear appeals from the Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals.Navajo Tribal Council Resolution No. CMY-39-78 (4 May 1978) Subsequently, the Supreme Judicial Council was criticized for bringing politics directly into the judicial system and undermining \\"impartiality, fairness and equal protection.\\"Advisory Committee of the Navajo Tribal Council (9 November 1983) \\"Recommending the Rescission and Repeal of Resolution CMY-39-78, Which Established the Supreme Judicial Council, and Revocation of Any Inconsistent Authority\\" available as an attachment to Navajo Tribal Council Resolution CD-94-85 In December 1985, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the Judicial Reform Act of 1985, which eliminated the Supreme Judicial Council. It redenominated the \\"Navajo Tribal Court of Appeals\\" as the \\"Navajo Nation Supreme Court\\", and redenominated the \\"Trial Courts of the Navajo Tribe\\" as \\"District Courts of the Navajo Nation\\".Navajo Tribal Council Resolution No. CD-94-85 (4 December 1985) Navajo courts are governed by Title 7, \\"Courts and Procedures\\", of the Navajo Tribal Code. From 1988 to 2006, there were seven judicial districts and two satellite courts. , there are ten judicial districts, centered respectively in Alamo (Alamo/T√≥'hajiilee), Aneth, Chinle, Crownpoint, Dilkon, Kayenta, Ramah, Shiprock, Tuba City and Window Rock.\\"Judicial Districts of the Navajo Nation\\" Navajo Courts webpage, 29 May 2010, last accessed 3 November 2010 All of the districts also have family courts, which have jurisdiction over domestic relations, civil relief in domestic violence, child custody and protection, name changes, quiet title and probate. , there were 17 trial judges presiding in the Navajo district and family courts. =Executive branch= The Navajo Nation Presidency, in its current form, was created on December 15, 1989, after directives from the federal government guided the Tribal Council to establish the current judicial, legislative, and executive model. This was a departure from the system of \\"Council and Chairmanship\\" from the previous government body. Conceptual additions were added to the language of Navajo Nation Code Title II, and the acts expanded the new government on April 1, 1990. There are several qualifications for the position of president, including fluency in the Navajo language. (This has seldom been enforced and in 2015, the council changed the law to repeal this requirement.) Term limits allow only two consecutive terms. =Legislative branch= Navajo Nation Council Chamber, a National Historic Landmark The Navajo Nation Council, formerly the Navajo Tribal Council, is the legislative branch of the Navajo Nation. , the Navajo Nation Council consists of 24 delegates representing the 110 chapters, elected every four years by registered Navajo voters. Prior to the November 2010 election, the Navajo Nation Council consisted of 88 representatives. The Navajo voted for the change in an effort to have a more efficient government and to curb tribal government corruption associated with council members who established secure seats.\\"Majority of Din√© vote for 24-member council, line- item veto for president\\", The Navajo Times Online Chapters In 1927, agents of the U.S. federal government initiated a new form of local government entities called Chapters, modeled after governments such as counties or townships. Each Chapter elected officers and followed parliamentary procedures. By 1933, more than 100 chapters operated across the territory. The chapters served as liaisons between the Navajo and the federal government, and also acted as precincts for the elections of tribal council delegates. They served as forums for local tribal leaders. But, the chapters had no authority within the structure of the Navajo Nation government.David E. Wilkins, The Navojo Political Experience, 1999, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., pp. 81‚Äì82. In 1998, the Navajo Tribal Council passed the \\"Local Governance Act,\\" which expanded the political roles of the existing 110 chapters. It authorized them to make decisions on behalf of the chapter members and take over certain roles previously delegated to the council and executive branches. This included entering into intergovernmental agreements with federal, state and tribal entities, subject to approval by the Intergovernmental Relations Committee of the council. =Administrative divisions=Agencies and chapters The Navajo Nation is divided into five agencies across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah, with the seat of government located at the Navajo Governmental Campus at Window Rock/Ts√©gh√°hoodz√°n√≠. These agencies are similar to county entities and reflect the five Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) agencies created in the early years of the Navajo Nation. The five agencies within the Navajo Nation are the Chinle Agency in Chinle, Arizona; Eastern Navajo Agency in Crownpoint, New Mexico; Western Navajo Agency in Tuba City, Arizona; Fort Defiance Agency in Fort Defiance, Arizona; and Shiprock Agency in Shiprock, New Mexico. The BIA agencies provide various technical services under direction of the BIA's Navajo Area Office at Gallup, New Mexico. Agencies are further divided into chapters as the smallest political unit, similar to municipalities. The Navajo capital city of Window Rock is located in the Chapter of St. Michaels, Arizona. The Navajo Nation also has executive offices in the US capital of Washington, DC for lobbying services and congressional relations. Departments and divisions=Law enforcement= The Navajo law enforcement consists of roughly 300 tribal police officers with only 3 non-native officers. Certain classes of crimes, such as capital cases, are prosecuted and adjudicated in Federal courts. However, the Navajo Nation operates its own divisions of law enforcement via the Navajo Division of Public Safety, commonly referred to as the Navajo Nation Police (formerly Navajo Tribal Police). Law enforcement functions are also delegated to the Navajo Nation Department of Fish and Wildlife: Wildlife Law Enforcement and Animal Control Sections; Navajo Nation Forestry Law Enforcement Officers; and the Navajo Nation EPA Criminal Enforcement Section; and Navajo Nation Resource Enforcement (Navajo Rangers). Other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies routinely work on the Navajo Nation, including the BIA Police, National Park Service U.S. Park Rangers, U.S. Forest Service Law Enforcement and Investigations, Bureau of Land Management Law Enforcement, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), US Marshals, and Federal Bureau of Investigation; and other Native American units: the Ute Mountain Agency, and Hopi Agency; and Arizona Highway Patrol, Utah Highway Patrol, New Mexico Department of Public Safety (State Police and Highway Patrol), Apache County Sheriff's Office, Navajo County Sheriff's Office, McKinley County Sheriff's Office. =Other agencies= *Transportation *Health *Education Regional Commissions In addition, regional government functions are carried out by the \\"District Grazing Committees\\" and \\"Off-Reservation Land Boards\\", \\"Major Irrigation Projects Farm Boards\\", and \\"Agency Councils\\".David E.

Joe Shirley Jr. and Chris Deschene had the two highest vote counts. In the weeks following, two other primary candidates sued in tribal court, invoking a never-used 1990s law to require assessment of the candidates' skills in the Navajo Language. On October 23, 2014, the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the tribe held the first hearing on the complaint filed against Deschene. The meeting was presided by chief hearing officer Richie Nez. The court body ruled in favor of Dale Tsosie and Hank Whitethorne, the former primary candidates, and issued a default ruling against Deschene, who had refused to participate. Later that day, the Navajo Supreme Court, in a special session on the matter, enforced the ruling from the lower Court body and ordered that the Navajo government remove Deschene from the presidential ballot because of his lack of Navajo language skills. The High Court ruled that the presidential election scheduled for November 4 (12 days later), would be postponed, and ordered that it be held by the end of January 2015. Chief Justice Herb Yazzie and Associate Justice Eleanor Shirley ruled for the 2‚Äì1 majority; Justice Irene Black wrote in her dissent that the technicality must be sent back to the lower court for correction there. The decision did not outline who would act as executive at the end of the current president's term (January 2015). In the early hours of October 24, the Navajo Council passed legislative Bill 0298-14 amending the Navajo Nation Code. The legislation dissolved the language requirement of the qualifications sections for president. The legislation allowed for Chris Deschene's participation.Arizona Capitol Times: Navajo Nation Council passes emergency language requirement repeal. October 23, 2014. Accessed February 15, 2015. The following Monday, the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors (NBES) met but took no action to implement the court directives. Counsel for NBES motioned the High Court for further instruction. The next day, the Navajo Nation Election Board commissioner, Wallace Charley, (he was joined later by Kimmeth Yazzie, Navajo Election Administration) announced that Deschene's name would remain on the ballot. Though he vowed to continue, Deschene bowed out of the race on October 30. On October 29, Ben Shelly vetoed the bill repealing the language requirement. The Navajo General Election was held. The unofficial tally found Joe Shirley Jr. with the majority. The Navajo Council scheduled a primary and general election for June and August 2015. On Monday, January 5, 2015, President Shelly vetoed the language fluency bill. On January 7, five assistant attorneys-general filed petition with the Navajo Nation Supreme Court for clarification on the question of the presidential vacancy issue. Through a controversial agreement and resolution, the Court and the Council appointed Ben Shelly to act as interim President. In the special election, businessman Russell Begaye was elected as president and Jonathan Nez as vice- president. In May 2015, they were sworn in. Begaye supports encouraging native language use among the Navajo, who have the most members speaking a native language of nearly any tribe. Approximately half of its 340,000 members speak Navajo. He came to office supporting the Grand Canyon Escalade, a proposed project to increase tourism at the canyon, as well as initiatives to develop a rail port to export crops and coal from the reservation and to pursue clean coal technology.\\"Navajo Nation president sworn in after contentious race\\", Al- Jazeera (US), 12 May 2015; accessed 12 December 2016 Infrastructure The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority provides utility services for houses.

International cooperation In December 2012, Ben Shelly led a delegation of Navajos overseas to Israel, where they toured the country as representatives for the Navajo people. In April 2013, Shelly's aide, Deswood Tome, led a delegation of Israeli agricultural specialists on a tour of resources on the Navajo Nation. The visit was criticized by some indigenous people who view Palestinian plight as similar to their own. Geography Map showing populated places on the Navajo Nation Navajo. Seven riders on horseback and dog trek against background of canyon cliffs. Edward S. Curtis (1904) The land area of the Navajo Nation is over , making it the largest Indian reservation in the United States; it is approximately 8,000 km2 larger than the state of West Virginia. Adjacent to or near the Navajo Nation are the Southern Ute of Colorado, the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe of Colorado, Utah, and New Mexico, both along the northern borders; the Jicarilla Apache Tribe to the east; the Zuni and White Mountain Apache to the south, and the Hualapai Bands in the west. The Navajo Nation's territory fully surrounds the Hopi Indian Reservation. In the 1980s, a conflict over shared lands peaked when the Department of the Interior attempted to relocate Navajo residents living in what is still referred to as the \\"Navajo/Hopi Joint Use Area.\\" The litigious and social conflict between the two tribes and neighboring communities ended with \\"The Bennett Freeze\\" Agreement and was completed in July 2009 by President Barack Obama. The agreement lessened the contentious land disagreement with a 75-year lease to Navajos with claims dating to before the US occupation. Situated on the Navajo Nation are Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Monument Valley, Rainbow Bridge National Monument, the Shiprock monadnock, and the eastern portion of the Grand Canyon. Navajo Territory in New Mexico is popularly referred as the \\"Checkerboard\\" area since the Federal Government's attempt to diversify lands with non-native lands. Thus these Navajo lands are intermingled with fee lands, owned by both Navajos and non- Navajos, and federal and state lands under various jurisdictions. Three large non-contiguous sections located in New Mexico are also under Navajo jurisdiction and are the Ramah Navajo Indian Reservation, the Alamo Navajo Indian Reservation, and the Tohajiilee Indian Reservation near Albuquerque. =Climate= Much of the Navajo Nation is situated atop the Colorado Plateau. The large variation in altitude ( to ) throughout the Navajo Nation is responsible for considerable variations in climate, from an arid, desert climate, comprising 55% of the area, an intermediate steppe region, and the cold, sub-humid climate of the mountainous 8%. Average daily temperatures range from to , with a low of in mountainous regions and a high of in the desert. Average rainfall is at higher elevations, and in the desert. =Daylight saving time= To maintain consistent time throughout its territory, the Navajo Nation observes daylight saving time (DST) on its Arizona land as well as on its Utah and New Mexico land, even though the rest of Arizona, including the Hopi Reservation, an enclave within the Arizona portion of the Nation, have opted out of DST. Demographics According to the 2016 census, the Navajo Nation had a population of 356,890. According to the same source, 166,826 were Navajo or other Native American (previously reported here as 96% despite actually being only about 47%), 3,249 White, 401 Asian or Pacific Islanders, 208 African American, and the remainder identifying some other group or more than one ancestry. The 2010 census counts 109,963 individuals who report speaking a language at home that is neither Asian nor Indo-European. DiscoverNavajo.com reports that 96% of the Navajo Nation is American Indian, and 66% of Navajo tribe members live on Navajo Nation. The average family size was 4.1, and the average household was home to 3.5 persons. The average household income in 2010 was $27,389. Nearly half of the enrolled members of the Navajo tribe live outside the nation ºs territory, and the total population is 300,048, as of July 2011.Donovan, Bill. \\"Census: Navajo enrollment tops 300,000\\".

Education A Navajo man on horseback in Monument Valley Navajo girl Canyon de Chelly, (1941) Ansel Adams Historically, the Navajo Nation resisted compulsory western education, including boarding schools, as imposed by General Richard Henry Pratt in the aftermath of the Long Walk. This does not negate, however, the scope and breadth of traditional and home education provided by Navajo families and custom since before the US annexation. Education, and retention of the Navajo student, are significant priorities. Major problems faced by the Nations surrounds building competitive GPAs for students on a national level, coupled with a very high drop-out rate among high school students. Over 150 public, private and Bureau of Indian Affairs schools serve Nation students from kindergarten through high school. Most schools are funded from the Navajo Nation under the Johnson O‚ÄôMalley program. The Nation runs community Head Start Programs, the only educational program fully operated by the Navajo Nation government. Post-secondary education and vocational training are available on and off the territory. The Navajo Nation operates Ts√©hootsoo√≠ Din√© Bi'√≥lta', a Navajo language immersion school for grades K-8 in Fort Defiance, Arizona. Located on the Arizona-New Mexico border in the southeastern quarter of the Navajo Nation, the school strives to revitalize Navajo among children of the Window Rock Unified School District. Ts√©hootsoo√≠ Din√© Bi'√≥lta' has thirteen Navajo language teachers who instruct only in the Navajo language, and no English, while five English language teachers instruct in the English language. Kindergarten and first grade are taught completely in the Navajo language, while English is incorporated into the program during third grade, when it is used for about 10% of instruction. =Secondary education= The Nation has six systems of secondary academic institutions that serve Navajo students, including: * Arizona public schools * New Mexico public schools * Utah public schools * Bureau of Indian Affairs public schools * Association of Navajo-Controlled schools * Navajo Preparatory School, Inc. =Din√© College ‚Äì Tsaile campus= Tsaile campus The Navajo Nation operates Din√© College, a two-year community college with its main campus at Tsaile in Apache County, Arizona. The college also operates seven other sub-campuses throughout the nation. The Navajo Nation Council founded the college in 1968 as the first tribal college in the United States.Marjane Ambler, \\"While globalizing their movement, tribal colleges import ideas\\", Tribal College Journal of American Indian Higher Education, Vol. 16 No.4, Summer 2005, accessed 7 July 2011 Since then, tribal colleges had been established on numerous reservations and now total 32. Din√© College has 1,830 students enrolled, of which 210 are degree-seeking transfer students for four-year institutions. Center for Din√© Studies The college includes the Center for Din√© Studies. Its goal is to apply Navajo Sa'ah Naagh√°√≠ Bik'eh H√≥zh√≥√≥n principles to advance quality student learning through Nits√°h√°kees (thinking), Nahat'√° (planning), Iin√° (living), and Siihasin (assurance) in study of the Din√© language, history, and culture. Students are prepared for further studies and employment in a multi-cultural and technological world. =Navajo Technical University (NTU)= Located in Crownpoint, New Mexico, Navajo Technical University is a tribal university offering various vocational, technical, and academic degrees and certificates. NTU was originally opened in 1979 as the Navajo Skill Center with the intention of providing educational opportunity of the unemployed population of the Navajo Nation. The center has since been renamed multiple time in response to growth and expansion. In 1985 it was renamed Crownpoint Institute of Technology and in 2006 to Navajo Technical College. Finally, in 2013 it was named a \\"university\\" in recognition of its program expansion under resolution codified by The Navajo Nation Council. Health concerns=Uranium mining and large-scale effects on the Navajo People= Extensive uranium mining took place in areas of the Navajo Nation before environmental laws were passed or enforced on the control of hazardous wastes of such operations, or their fallout. Studies have proven the unregulated practices created severe environmental consequences for people living nearby. Several types of cancer occur at much higher rates than the national average in these locations.Raloff, 2004 Especially high are the rates of reproductive-organ cancers in teenage Navajo girls, averaging seventeen times higher than the average of girls in the United States. Residents of the Red Water Pond Road area have requested relocation to a new, off-grid village to be located on Standing Black Tree Mesa while cleanup progresses on the Northeast Church Rock Mine Superfund site, as an alternative to the EPA- proposed relocation of residents to Gallup.  Navajo Neurohepatopathology  The Navajo are uniquely affected by a rare and life-threatening autosomal recessive multisystem disorder called Navajo Neurohepatopathology (NNH), a genetic condition estimated to occur in 1 of every 1,600 live births. The most severe symptoms include neuropathy and liver dysfunction (hepatopathy), both of which may be moderate and progressive or severe and fatal, as it often is in cases that develop in infants (before 6 months of age) or children (1-5 years). Other symptoms include corneal anesthesia and scarring, acral mutilation, cerebral leukoencephalopathy, failure to thrive, and recurrent metabolic acidosis with intercurrent infections.Navajo woman and child, c.1880-1910 =Diabetes= Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among the Navajo, Hopi and Pima tribes, who are diagnosed at a rate about four times higher than the age-standardized U.S. estimate. Medical researchers believe increased consumption of carbohydrates, coupled with genetic factors, play significant roles in the emergence of this chronic disease among Native Americans.American Indians and Alaska Natives and Diabetes. National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse. =Severe combined immunodeficiency= One in every 2,500 children in the Navajo population inherits severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a genetic disorder that results in children with virtually no immune system. In the general population, the genetic disorder is much more rare, affecting one in 100,000 children. The disorder is sometimes known as \\"bubble boy disease\\". This condition is a significant cause of illness and death among Navajo children. Research reveals a similar genetic pattern among the related Apache. In a December 2007 Associated Press article, Mortan Cowan, M.D., director of the Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that, although researchers have identified about a dozen genes that cause SCID, the Navajo/Apache population has the most severe form of the disorder. This is due to the mutations in the gene DCLRE1C, which leads to a defective copy of the protein Artemis. Without the gene, children's bodies are unable to repair DNA or develop disease-fighting cells.Fonseca, Salt Lake Tribune, B10 = COVID-19 pandemic = The COVID-19 pandemic reached the Navajo Nation on March 17, 2020. On March 20, a stay-at-home order was issued after 14 cases of the coronavirus were confirmed, with an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew enforced. Beginning April 12, a 57-hour weekend curfew was declared. At that point, there were 698 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including 24 deaths, among members of the Navajo Nation living in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah. By April 18, there were 1,197 cases. On April 19, the Navajo Department of Health issued an emergency public health order mandating the use of masks outside the home, in addition to existing orders for sheltering in place and nightly and weekend curfews. By April 20, the Navajo Nation had the third-highest infection rate in the United States, after New York and New Jersey. On April 25, the Nation announced that it was joining 10 other tribes in a lawsuit against the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, over what the plaintiffs said was an unfair allocation of money to the tribes under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). On May 5, $600 million of aid money was delivered to the Navajo Nation, a month after the legislation was signed into law. As of 18 May 2020, the Navajo Nation surpassed New York as most affected U.S. region per capita, with 4,071 positive COVID-19 tests and 142 fatalities recorded. there are 8,187 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 401 deaths from the virus. Economy Number of Dib√© (sheep) on the Navajo Nation An important part of the Navajo economy and culture is based on the raising of sheep and goats. Navajo families process the wool and sell it for cash, or turn it into yarn and produce blankets and rugs for sale. The Navajo are noted for their skill in creating turquoise and silver jewelry. Navajo artists have other traditional arts, such as sand painting, sculpture, and pottery. Dib√© (sheep) remain an important aspect of Navajo culture and economy. The Navajo Nation has created a mixture of industry and business which has provided the Navajo with alternative opportunities to traditional occupations. The Nation's median cash household income is around $20,000 per year. However, using Federal standards, unemployment levels fluctuates between 40 and 45%. About 40% of families live below the Federal poverty rate. = Natural resources = Mining ‚Äì especially of coal and uranium provided significant income to both the Navajo Nation and individual Navajos in the second half of the 20th century.See the three volumes produced by the Bureau of Indian Affairs 1955‚Äì1956: Kiersch, George A. (1956) Mineral Resources, Navajo-Hopi Indian Reservations, Arizona-Utah: Geology, Evaluation, and Uses, volumes 1‚Äì3, United States. Bureau of Indian Affairs, University of Arizona Press, Tucson, Arizona, Many of these mines have closed. In the early 21st century, mining still provides significant revenues to the tribe in terms of leases (51% of all tribal income in 2003). Individual Navajos are part of the 1,000 people employed in mining. Coal The volume of coal mined on the Navajo Nation land has declined in the early 21st century. The Chevron Corporation's P&M; McKinley Mine was the first large-scale surface coal mine in New Mexico when it opened in 1961. It closed in January 2010. Peabody Energy's Black Mesa coal mine, a controversial strip mine, was shut down in December 2005 because of its environmental impact and lost an appeal to reopen in January 2010. The Black Mesa mine fed the 1.5 GW Mohave Power Station at Laughlin, Nevada, via a slurry pipeline that used water from the Black Mesa aquifer. The nearby Kayenta Mine used the Black Mesa & Lake Powell Railroad to move coal to the former Navajo Generating Station (2.2 GW) at Page, Arizona. The Kayenta mine provided the majority of leased revenues for the tribe. The Kayenta mine also provided wages to those Navajos who were part of its 400 employees. The Navajo Mine opened in 1963 near Fruitland, New Mexico, and employs about 350 people. It supplies sub-bituminous coal to the 2 GW Four Corners Power Plant via the isolated 13-mile Navajo Mine Railroad. Parts of the Navajo Nation acquired the mine and three mines in Montana and Wyoming. Uranium The uranium market, which was active during and after the second World War, slowed near the end of that period. The Nation has suffered considerable environmental contamination and health effects as a result of poor regulation of uranium mining. As of 2005, the Navajo Nation has prohibited uranium mining altogether within its borders. Oil and natural gas There are developed and potential oil and gas fields on the Navajo Nation. The oldest and largest group of fields is in the Paradox Basin in the Four Corners area. Most of these fields are located in the Aneth Extension in Utah but there are a few wells in Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona. The first well was drilled in the Aneth Extension in 1956. In 2006 the Paradox Basin fields were injected with water and Co2 to increase declining production. There are also wells in the Checkerboard area in New Mexico that are on leased land owned by individual Navajos. The selling of leases and oil royalties have changed over the years. The Aneth Extension was created from Public Domain lands as part a 1933 exchange for lands flooded by Lake Powell. Congress appointed Utah as trustee on behalf of Navajos living in San Juan County, Utah for any potential revenues that came from natural resources in the area. Utah initially created a 3-person committee to make leases, receive royalties and improve the living conditions for Utah Navajos. As the revenues and resulting expenditures increased, Utah created the 12 member Navajo Commission to do the operational work. The Navajo Nation and Bureau of Indian Affairs are also involved. There are several Navajo organizations that deal with oil and gas. The Utah Din√© Corporation is a nonprofit organization established to take over from the Navajo Commission. The Navajo Nation Oil and Gas Company owns and operates oil and natural gas interests primarily in New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah. Federally incorporated, it is wholly owned by the Navajo Nation. Renewables In early 2008, the Navajo Nation and Houston-based IPP entered into an agreement to monitor wind resources, with the potential to build a 500-megawatt wind farm some 50 miles (80 km) north of Flagstaff, Arizona. Known as the Navajo Wind Project, it is proposed as the second commercial wind farm in Arizona after Iberdrola's Dry Lake Wind Power Project between Holbrook and Overgaard-Heber. The project is to be built on Aubrey Cliffs in Coconino County, Arizona.ICTMN Staff, \\"Navajo-Owned Wind Farm in Works in Arizona\\", Indian Country Today, 17 August 2011; accessed 12 December 2016 In December 2010, the President and Navajo Council approved a proposal by the NTUA, an enterprise of the Navajo Nation and Edison Mission Energy, to develop an 85-megawatt wind project at Big Boquillas Ranch, which is owned by the Navajo Nation and is located 80 miles west of Flagstaff. NTUA plans to develop this to a 200-megawatt capacity at peak. This has been planned as the first majority-owned native project; NTUS was to own 51%. An estimated 300‚Äì350 people will construct the facility; it will have 10 permanent jobs. In August 2011, the Salt River Project, an Arizona utility, was announced as the first utility customer. Permitting and negotiations involve tribal, federal, state and local stakeholders.Alastair Lee Bitsoi, \\"Wind project holds promise for tribe\\", Navajo Times, 4 August 2011; accessed 12 December 2016 The project is intended not only as a shift to renewable energy but to increase access for tribal members; an estimated 16,000 homes are without access to electricity.Gerald Carr, \\"Asserting Treaty Rights to Harness the Wind on the Great Lakes\\", American Indian Law Journal, Fall 2013; accessed 12 December 2016 The wind project has foundered because of a \\"long feud between Cameron [Chapter] and Window Rock [central government] over which company to back.\\" Both companies pulled out. Negotiations with Clipper Windpower looked promising but that company was put up for sale after the recession.[ Cindy Yurth, \\"Waiting for a fair wind\\"], Navajo Times, 29 November 2012; accessed 12 December 2016 =Parks and attractions= Tourism is important to the Nation. Parks and attractions within traditional Navajo lands include: *Monument Valley (on the Utah and Arizona border, near the town of Kayenta, Arizona) *Shiprock Pinnacle (large volcanic remnants, elevation 7,178, located in New Mexico near Shiprock) *Navajo Mountain (mountain along Utah and Arizona border, elevation 10,318) *Navajo Nation Tribal Memorial Park *Chaco Canyon *Bisti/De-Na-Zin Wilderness *Canyon De Chelly *Window Rock Tribal Park *Navajo Nation Museum *Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park *Antelope Canyon *Lake Powell *Navajo Bridge *Little Colorado River Gorge *Kinlichee Ruins *Four Corners Monument *Hubbell Trading Post *Grand Falls *Rainbow Bridge National Monument *Narbona Pass Narbona Pass Chuska Mountains =Navajo arts and craft enterprise= An important small business group on the Navajo Nation is handmade arts and crafts industry, which markets both high- and medium-end quality goods made by Navajo artisans, jewelers and silversmiths. A 2004 study by the Navajo Division of Economic Development found that at least 60% of all families have at least one family member producing arts and crafts for the market.. A survey conducted by the Arizona Hospitality Research & Resource Center reported that the Navajo nation made $20,428,039 from the art and crafts trade in 2011. =Din√© Development Corp.= The Din√© Development Corporation was formed in 2004 to promote Navajo business and seek viable business development to make use of casino revenues. Media=Navajo Times= The Navajo Nation is served by various print media operations. The Navajo Times used to be published as the Navajo Times Today. Created by the Navajo Nation Council in 1959, it has been privatized. It continues to be the newspaper of record for the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Times is the largest Native American-owned newspaper company in the United States.Kristi Eaton (AP), \\"National Native American magazine going digital\\", Associated Press- The Big Story, 14 July 2013; accessed 8 December 2016. Note: In 2013 journalist Tim Giago, founder of Indian Country Today, said that the Navajo Times was \\"the largest Indian newspaper in America.\\" =KTNN= Established as a Navajo Nation Enterprise in 1985, KTNN is a commercial station that provides information and entertainment located on AM 660. =Other newspapers= Other newsprint groups also serve the Nation. The media outlets include the Navajo/Hopi Observer, serving Navajo, Hopi and towns of Winslow and Flagstaff, and the Navajo Post, a web-based with print outlet that serves urban Navajos from its offices at Tempe. Non-Navajo papers also target Navajo audiences, such as the Gallup Independent.

Vast numbers of Jews in the Jewish diaspora accepted his claims, even after he outwardly became an apostate due to his forced conversion to Islam in the same year. Sabbatai Zevi's followers, both during his \\"Messiahship\\" and after his forced conversion to Islam, are known as Sabbateans. Part of the Sabbateans lived on until well into 21st-century Turkey as descendants of the D√∂nmeh. Sabbateans who remained Jews Jewish Messiah, from Tikkun, Amsterdam, 1666 In Jewish history, many Jews after Sabbatai Zevi's feigned apostasy, although horrified, clung to the belief that Zevi could still be regarded as the true Jewish Messiah. They constituted the largest number of Sabbateans during the 17th and 18th centuries. By the 19th century, Jewish Sabbateans had been reduced to small groups of hidden followers who feared being discovered for their beliefs, that were deemed to be entirely heretical and antithetical to Rabbinic Judaism. These very Jews fell under the category of \\"sectarian\\" Sabbateans, which originated when many Sabbateans refused to accept that Zevi's feigned apostasy might have been indicative of the fact that their faith was genuinely an illusion. Another large group of Sabbateans succeeding Zevi's feigned apostasy began to view Islam in an extremely negative light. Polemics against Islam erupted directly after Zevi's forced conversion. Some of these attacks were considered part of a largely anti- Sabbatean agenda. Accusations coming from anti-Sabbatean Jews revolved around the idea that Sabbatai Zevi's feigned conversion to Islam was rightfully an indicator of a false claim of Messianship. Sabbatai Zevi's conversion to Islam Jewish historians have stated that it is hard to describe the national sense of shock and trauma that set in when the masses of Jews all over the world learned that someone as famous as Sabbatai Zevi had officially abandoned his faith for Islam. However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren. Sabbatean ‚Äì Sufi similarities Claims of ties between Sabbatean Kabbalah and Sufism go back to the days of Sabbatai Zevi.[2] This is largely based on the contention that Zevi's exile in the Balkans brought him into close contact with several forms of unorthodox Sufism which existed in the region. The D√∂nme community of Salonika came to play a significant role in the Sufi life of the region and its members actively involved with a number of Sufi orders, particularly the Mevlevi. Some alleged similarities between D√∂nme and unorthodox Sufi practice seem to exist, including the violation of kashrut/halal, sexual license, ecstatic singing, mystical interpretations of sacred scripture, and the practice of ritual meals. However, confirmed direct ties between Sabbatai Zevi and any Sufi order are conjectural and hearsay. The often claimed connection between the movement and Bektashi Sufism relies merely on circumstantial evidence and coincidence rather than any concrete substantiation. During Zevi's lifetime the Bektashi order had yet to attain widespread popularity in the Balkans; it came to dominate southern Albania only in the late 19th century. Nevertheless, there were a number of other heterodox Sufi movements in the region in the mid-17th century, including the Hamzevis, Melamis and Qalandars. =The D√∂nme= Inside the Ottoman Empire, those followers of Zevi who had converted to Islam but who secretly continued Jewish observances and Brit Mila became known as the D√∂nme ( \\"convert\\"). There were some internal sub-divisions within the sect, according to the geographical locations of the group, and according to who the leaders of these groups were after the death of Shabbatai Zevi. Sabbatean-related controversies in Jewish history=The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy= The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy was a serious rabbinical disputation with wider political ramifications in Europe that followed the accusations by Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697‚Äì1776) who was a fierce opponent of the Sabbateans, against Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz (1690‚Äì1764) whom he accused of being a secret Sabbatean. The Emden-Eybeschutz controversy arose concerning the amulets which Emden suspected Eybeschutz of issuing. It was alleged that these amulets recognized the messianic claims of Sabbatai Zevi. Emden then accused Eybeschutz of heresy. Emden was known for his attacks directed against the adherents, or those he supposed to be adherents, of Sabbatai Zevi. In Emden's eyes, Eybeschutz was a convicted Sabbatean. The controversy lasted several years, continuing even after Eybeschutz's death. Emden's assertion of heresy was chiefly based on the interpretation of some amulets prepared by Eybeschutz, in which Emden professed to see Sabbatean allusions. Hostilities began before Eybeschutz left Prague; when Eybeschutz was named chief rabbi of the three communities of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbek in 1751, the controversy reached the stage of intense and bitter antagonism. Emden maintained that he was at first prevented by threats from publishing anything against Eybeschutz. He solemnly declared in his synagogue the writer of the amulets to be a Sabbatean heretic and deserving of ·∏•erem (excommunication). The majority of the rabbis in Poland, Moravia, and Bohemia, as well as the leaders of the Three Communities, supported Eybeschutz: the accusation was \\"utterly incredible\\" - In July 1725, the Ashkenazic beit din of Amsterdam had issued a ban of excommunication on the entire Sabbatian sect (kat ha-ma‚Äôaminim). Writings of Sabbatian nature found by the beit Din at that time were attributed to Eybeschutz Emden, Beit Yehonatan ha-Sofer, fol. 4. In early September, similar proclamations were issued by the batei din of Frankfurt and the triple community of Altona, Hamburg, and Wandsbeck. The three bans were printed and circulated in other Jewish communities throughout Europe.Excerpts from the testimonies were printed by Emden in his Beit Yehonatan ha-Sofer, Altona 1762, fol. 4v; the full text of the testimonies, letters, and proclamations pertaining to the investigation can be found in [Josef Prager], Gahalei Esh, Oxford, Bodleian Library. Ms. 2186, Vol. I, fols. 70r -129 Rabbi Ezekiel Katzenellenbogen, the chief rabbi of the Triple Community and Rabbi Moses Hagiz Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54 were unwilling to attack Eybesch√ºtz publicly, mentioning that ‚Äògreater than him have fallen and crumbled‚Äô and that ‚Äòthere is nothing we can do to him‚Äô Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54 However, Rabbi Katzenelenbogen stated that one of the texts found by the Amsterdam beit din \\"Va-Avo ha-Yom el ha-Ayyin‚Äù was authored by Rabbi Jonathan Eybesch√ºtz and declared that the all copies of the work that were in circulation should be immediately burned. Prager, Gahalei Esh, Vol. I, fol. 54v. Emden later suggested that the rabbis decided against attacking Eybeschutz out of a reluctance to offend his powerful family and a fear of rich supporters of his living in their communities Emden, Sefer Hitabbkut, fos. 1v-2r As a result of Eyberschutz and other rabbis in Prague formulating a new (and different) ban against Sabbatianism in September of that year his reputation was restored and Eybeschutz was regarded as having been totally vindicated. [Prager], Gahalei Esh, fol.112r The issue was to arise again, albeit tangentially, in the 1751 dispute between Emden and Eyberschutz. The controversy was a momentous incident in Jewish history of the period, involving both Yechezkel Landau and the Vilna Gaon, and may be credited with having crushed the lingering belief in Sabbatai current even in some Orthodox circles. In 1760 the quarrel broke out once more when some Sabbatean elements were discovered among the students of Eybeschutz' yeshiva. At the same time his younger son, Wolf, presented himself as a Sabbatean prophet, with the result that the yeshiva was closed. =Sabbateans and early Hasidism= Some scholars see seeds of the Hasidic movement within the Sabbatean movement. When Hasidism began to spread its influence, a serious schism evolved between the Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. Those who rejected the Hasidic movement dubbed themselves as misnagdim (\\"opponents\\"). Critics of Hasidic Judaism expressed concern that Hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank. However the Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, came at a time when the Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment and disappointment engendered by the two Jewish false messiahs Sabbatai Zevi (1626‚Äì1676) and Jacob Frank (1726‚Äì1791) in particular. =Sabbateans and modern secularism= Some scholars have noted that the Sabbatean movement in general fostered and connected well with the principles of modern secularism. Related to this is the drive of the Donmeh in Turkey for secularizing their society just as European Jews promoted the values of Age of Enlightenment and its Jewish equivalent the haskalah. Disillusioned Jewish Sabbateans Former followers of Shabbatai do penance for their support of him. Sabbatai's conversion to Islam was extremely disheartening for the world's Jewish communities. Among the masses of the people the greatest confusion reigned. In addition to the misery and disappointment from within, Muslims and Christians jeered at and scorned the credulous and duped Jews. In spite of Sabbatai's apostasy, many of his adherents still tenaciously clung to him, claiming that his conversion was a part of the Messianic scheme. This belief was further upheld and strengthened by the likes of Nathan of Gaza and Samuel Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement. Rabbis who opposed the Sabbateans=Joseph Escapa= Rabbi Joseph Escapa (1572‚Äì1662) was especially known for having been the teacher of Zevi and for having afterward excommunicated him. =Aaron Lapapa= Rabbi Aaron Lapapa (1590‚Äì1674) was the rabbi at Smyrna in 1665, when Zevi's movement was at its height there. He was one of the few rabbis who had the courage to oppose the false prophet and excommunicate him. Zevi and his adherents retorted by deposing him and forcing him to leave the city, and his office was given to his colleague, Hayyim Benveniste, at that time one of Sabbatai's followers. After Sabbatai's conversion to Islam, Lapapa seems to have been reinstated. =Jacob Hagis= Rabbi Jacob Hagis (1620‚Äì1674) was one of Zevi's chief opponents, who put him under the ban. About 1673 Hagis went to Constantinople to publish his Lehem ha-Panim, but he died there before this was accomplished. This book, as well as many others of his, was lost. =Moses Hagiz= Rabbi Moses Hagiz (1671- c. 1750) was born in Jerusalem and waged a campaign against Sabbatean emissaries during 1725-1726. =Jacob ben Aaron Sasportas= Rabbi Jacob ben Aaron Sasportas (1610‚Äì1698) was one of the fiercest opponents of the Sabbatean movement. He wrote many letters to various communities in Europe, Asia, and Africa, exhorting them to unmask the impostors and to warn the people against them. He documented his struggle in his book Tzitzat Novel Tzvi, the title being based on Isaiah 28:4. He wrote a number of works, such as Toledot Ya'akob (1652), an index of Biblical passages found in the haggadah of the Jerusalem Talmud, similar to Aaron Pesaro's Toledot Aharon, which relates to the Babylonian Talmud only; and Ohel Ya'akov (1737), a volume of halachik responsa which includes polemical correspondence against Zevi and his followers. =David Nieto= Rabbi David Nieto (1654‚Äì1728) was the haham of the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community in London. He waged war untiringly on the Sabbateans, which he regarded as dangerous to the best interests of Judaism, and in this connection wrote his Esh Dat (London, 1715) against Nehemiah Hayyun (who supported Zevi). =Tzvi Ashkenazi= Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi (1656‚Äì1718) known as the Chacham Tzvi, for some time rabbi of Amsterdam, was a resolute opponent of the followers of Sabbatai Zevi. In Salonica he also witnessed the impact of the Sabbatai Zevi movement on the community, and this experience became a determining factor in his whole career. His son Jacob Emden served as rabbi in Emden and followed in his father's footsteps in combating the Sabbatean movement. =Jacob Emden= Rabbi Jacob Emden (1697‚Äì1776) was Talmudic scholar and leading opponent of the Sabbatians. He is best known as the opponent of Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschutz whom he accused of being a Sabbatean during The Emden-Eybesch√ºtz Controversy. =Naphtali Cohen= Rabbi Naphtali Cohen (1649‚Äì1718) was a kabbalist who was tricked into giving an approbation to a book by the Sabbatean Nehemiah Hayyun. Provided with this and with other recommendations secured in the same way, Hayyun traveled throughout Moravia and Silesia, propagating everywhere his Sabbatean teachings. Cohen soon discovered his mistake, and endeavored, without success, to recover his approbation, although he did not as yet realize the full import of the book. It was in 1713, while Cohen was staying at Breslau (where he acted as a rabbi until 1716), that Haham Tzvi Ashkenazi of Amsterdam informed him of its tenets. Cohen thereupon acted rigorously. He launched a ban against the author and his book, and became one of the most zealous supporters of Haham Tzvi in his campaign against Hayyun.

The Natural History Museum, London, p. 15. Through the 19th century, the word \\"kelp\\" was closely associated with seaweeds that could be burned to obtain soda ash (primarily sodium carbonate). The seaweeds used included species from both the orders Laminariales and Fucales. The word \\"kelp\\" was also used directly to refer to these processed ashes.\\"Kelp,\\" in Oxford English Dictionary (Second Edition). Oxford University Press, 1989. Retrieved 1 December 2006 Description In most kelp, the thallus (or body) consists of flat or leaf-like structures known as blades. Blades originate from elongated stem-like structures, the stipes. The holdfast, a root-like structure, anchors the kelp to the substrate of the ocean. Gas-filled bladders (pneumatocysts) form at the base of blades of American species, such as Nereocystis lueteana, (Mert. & Post & Rupr.) to hold the kelp blades close to the surface. Growth and reproduction Scuba diving in a kelp forest in California. Growth occurs at the base of the meristem, where the blades and stipe meet. Growth may be limited by grazing. Sea urchins, for example, can reduce entire areas to urchin barrens.Norderhaug, KM., Christie, H. 2009. Sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the NE Atlantic. Marine Biology Research 5: 515-528. Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science 95: 135-144 The kelp life cycle involves a diploid sporophyte and haploid gametophyte stage. The haploid phase begins when the mature organism releases many spores, which then germinate to become male or female gametophytes. Sexual reproduction then results in the beginning of the diploid sporophyte stage, which will develop into a mature individual. The parenchymatous thalli are generally covered with a mucilage layer, rather than cuticle. Kelp forests Kelp may develop dense forests with high production,Abdullah, M.I., Fredriksen, S., 2004.

While larger invertebrates and in particular sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (O.F. M√ºller) are important secondary consumers controlling large barren ground areas on the Norwegian coast, they are scarce inside dense kelp forests.Norderhaug, K.M., Christie, H., 2009. Sea urchin grazing and kelp re-vegetation in the NE Atlantic. Marine Biology Research 5, 515-528. Commercial uses Alaskan beach kelp Giant kelp can be harvested fairly easily because of its surface canopy and growth habit of staying in deeper water. Kelp ash is rich in iodine and alkali. In great amount, kelp ash can be used in soap and glass production. Until the Leblanc process was commercialized in the early 19th century, burning of kelp in Scotland was one of the principal industrial sources of soda ash (predominantly sodium carbonate). Around 23 tons of seaweed was required to produce 1 ton of kelp ash. The kelp ash would consist of around 5% sodium carbonate. Jonathan Pereira, Fred B. Kilmer, The Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Volume 1, 1854, p. 558 Once the Leblanc Process became commercially viable in Britain during the 1820s, common salt replaced kelp ash as raw material for sodium carbonate. Though the price of kelp ash went into steep decline, seaweed remained the only commercial source of iodine. To supply the new industry in iodine synthesis, kelp ash production continued in some parts of West and North Scotland, North West Ireland and Guernsey. The species Saccharina latissima yielded the greatest amount of iodine (between 10-15 lbs per ton) and was most abundant in Guernsey. Iodine was extracted from kelp ash using a lixiviation process. Edward C. C. Stanford, Wentworth L. Scott, ‚ÄòThe Economic Applications of Seaweed‚Äô, February 14 1862, Journal of the Royal Society of Arts, Vol 10, No. 482, 185-199 . As with sodium carbonate however, mineral sources eventually replaced seaweed in iodine production. John J. McKetta Jr. Taylor & Francis, Encyclopaedia of Chemical Processing and Design: Volume 27 - Hydrogen Cyanide to Ketones Dimethyl (Acetone), 1988, p. 283 Alginate, a kelp-derived carbohydrate, is used to thicken products such as ice cream, jelly, salad dressing, and toothpaste, as well as an ingredient in exotic dog food and in manufactured goods. Alginate powder is also used frequently in general dentistry and orthodontics for making impressions of the upper and lower arches.Powers, John M. Powers. Craig's Restorative Dental Materials, 12th Edition. C.V. Mosby, 022006. p. 270 Kelp polysaccharides are used in skin care as gelling ingredients and because of the benefits provided by fucoidan. Kombu (ÊòÜÂ∏É in Japanese, and Êµ∑Â∏¶ in Chinese, Saccharina japonica and others), several Pacific species of kelp, is a very important ingredient in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean cuisines. Kombu is used to flavor broths and stews (especially dashi), as a savory garnish (tororo konbu) for rice and other dishes, as a vegetable, and a primary ingredient in popular snacks (such as tsukudani). Transparent sheets of kelp (oboro konbu) are used as an edible decorative wrapping for rice and other foods.Kazuko, Emi: Japanese Cooking, p. 78, Hermes House, 2002, p. 78. Kombu can be used to soften beans during cooking, and to help convert indigestible sugars and thus reduce flatulence.Graimes, Nicola: The Best-Ever Vegetarian Cookbook, Barnes & Noble Books, 1999, p. 59. Because of its high concentration of iodine, brown kelp (Laminaria) has been used to treat goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid gland caused by a lack of iodine, since medieval times.Iodine Helps Kelp Fight Free Radicals and May Aid Humans, Too Newswise, Retrieved on July 8, 2008. In 2010, researchers found that alginate, the soluble fibre substance in sea kelp, was better at preventing fat absorption than most over-the-counter slimming treatments in laboratory trials. As a food additive, it may be used to reduce fat absorption and thus obesity. Kelp in its natural form has not yet been demonstrated to have such effects. =Commercial production= Commercial production of kelp harvested from its natural habitat has taken place in Japan for over a century. Many countries today produce and consume laminaria products; the largest producer is China. Laminaria japonica, the important commercial seaweed, was first introduced into China in the late 1920s from Hokkaido, Japan. Yet mariculture of this alga on a very large commercial scale was realized in China only in the 1950s. Between the 1950s and the 1980s, kelp production in China increased from about 60 to over 250,000 dry weight metric tons annually. =Renewable energy source= Kelp has a high rate of growth and its decay is quite efficient in yielding methane, as well as sugars that can be converted to ethanol. It has been proposed that large open-ocean kelp farms could serve as a source of renewable energy. Unlike some biofuels such as corn ethanol, kelp energy avoids \\"food vs fuel\\" issues and does not require freshwater irrigation. In history and culture Some of the earliest evidence for human use of marine resources, coming from Middle Stone Age sites in South Africa, includes the harvesting of foods such as abalone, limpets, and mussels associated with kelp forest habitats. In 2007, Erlandson et al. suggested that kelp forests around the Pacific Rim may have facilitated the dispersal of anatomically modern humans following a coastal route from Northeast Asia to the Americas. This \\"kelp highway hypothesis\\" suggested that highly productive kelp forests supported rich and diverse marine food webs in nearshore waters, including many types of fish, shellfish, birds, marine mammals, and seaweeds that were similar from Japan to California, Erlandson and his colleagues also argued that coastal kelp forests reduced wave energy and provided a linear dispersal corridor entirely at sea level, with few obstacles to maritime peoples. Archaeological evidence from California's Channel Islands confirms that islanders were harvesting kelp forest shellfish and fish, beginning as much as 12,000 years ago. During the Highland Clearances, many Scottish Highlanders were moved on to areas of estates known as crofts, and went to industries such as fishing and kelping (producing soda ash from the ashes of kelp). At least until the 1840s, when there were steep falls in the price of kelp, landlords wanted to create pools of cheap or virtually free labour, supplied by families subsisting in new crofting townships. Kelp collection and processing was a very profitable way of using this labour, and landlords petitioned successfully for legislation designed to stop emigration. The profitability of kelp harvesting meant that landlords began to subdivide their land for small tenant kelpers, who could now afford higher rent than their gentleman farmer counterparts. J. M. Bumsted, The People's Clearance: Highland Emigration to British North America, 1770-1815, 1981 But the economic collapse of the kelp industry in northern Scotland during the 1820s led to further emigration, especially to North America. Natives of the Falkland Islands are sometimes nicknamed \\"Kelpers\\". allwords.com definition for \\"Kelper\\", dictionary.com definition for \\"Kelper\\" This designation is primarily applied by outsiders rather than the natives themselves. In Chinese slang, \\"kelp\\" (), is used to describe an unemployed returnee. It has negative overtones, implying the person is drifting aimlessly, and is also a homophonic expression (, literally \\"sea waiting\\"). This expression is contrasted with the employed returnee, having a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean: the \\"sea turtle\\" () and is also homophonic with another word (, literally \\"sea return\\"). Conservation Overfishing nearshore ecosystems leads to the degradation of kelp forests. Herbivores are released from their usual population regulation, leading to over-grazing of kelp and other algae. This can quickly result in barren landscapes where only a small number of species can thrive.Dayton, P.K. 1985a. Ecology of kelp communities.

Fishing, trophic cascades, and the structure of algal assemblages: evaluation of an old but untested paradigm. Oikos 82: 425-439. Other major factors which threaten kelp include marine pollution and the quality of water, climate changes and certain invasive species.

Plot Upper-middle class Mathieu, is spending his summer vacation on the French coast before beginning studies in the autumn to become an architect. His mother is deeply depressed because of the death of his baby brother from cancer, and is cared for by her sister, while Mathieu and his moody younger sister cannot get along. Then he meets C√©dric at the beach, who is attractive and obviously looking for a boyfriend. The boys embark on a romance, and Mathieu's sudden secrecy and long hours away from home invite the curiosity of both his sister and aunt. A parallel plotline focuses on Mathieu eighteen months later, as he recovers from the shock of their separation. After Mathieu has tried to commit suicide, he chooses to go back to the small seaside town to learn how to deal with what happened. The film ends on a hopeful note when Mathieu looks up Pierre, another former boyfriend of C√©dric's living in the seaside town, and they overcome past tensions to discover that they understand each other.

The usage originated in American English. Scholars use it as a technical term regarding legislative control of local appropriations. In election campaigns, the term is used in derogatory fashion to attack opponents. One of the most explicit definitions of the ‚Äúpork barrel‚Äù is given by Sharma (2017): ‚ÄúThe term ‚Äúpork‚Äêbarrel politics‚Äù refers to instances in which ruling parties channel public money to particular constituencies based on political considerations, at the expense of broader public interests‚Äù. Typically, \\"pork\\" involves funding for government programs whose economic or service benefits are concentrated in a particular area but whose costs are spread among all taxpayers. Public works projects, certain national defense spending projects, and agricultural subsidies are the most commonly cited examples. Citizens Against Government Waste outlines seven criteria by which spending can be classified as \\"pork\\": # Requested by only one chamber of Congress # Not specifically authorized # Not competitively awarded # Not requested by the President # Greatly exceeds the President's budget request or the previous year's funding # Not the subject of Congressional hearings # Serves only a local or special interest. History and etymology The term pork barrel politics usually refers to spending which is intended to benefit constituents of a politician in return for their political support, either in the form of campaign contributions or votes. In the popular 1863 story \\"The Children of the Public\\", Edward Everett Hale used the term pork barrel as a homely metaphor for any form of public spending to the citizenry.The story first appeared in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, Jan. 24 and Jan. 31, 1863. However, after the American Civil War, the term came to be used in a derogatory sense. The Oxford English Dictionary dates the modern sense of the term from 1873.Oxford English Dictionary, pork barrel, draft revision June 2008. Retrieved October 22, 2008. Pork barrel originally came from storing meat. By the 1870s, references to \\"pork\\" were common in Congress, and the term was further popularized by a 1919 article by Chester Collins Maxey in the National Municipal Review, which reported on certain legislative acts known to members of Congress as \\"pork barrel bills\\". He claimed that the phrase originated in a pre-Civil War practice of giving slaves a barrel of salt pork as a reward and requiring them to compete among themselves to get their share of the handout. More generally, a barrel of salt pork was a common larder item in 19th-century households, and could be used as a measure of the family's financial well-being. For example, in his 1845 novel The Chainbearer, James Fenimore Cooper wrote: \\"I hold a family to be in a desperate way, when the mother can see the bottom of the pork barrel.\\" Quoted in: Examples An early example of pork barrel politics in the United States was the Bonus Bill of 1817, which was introduced by Democrat John C. Calhoun to construct highways linking the Eastern and Southern United States to its Western frontier using the earnings bonus from the Second Bank of the United States. Calhoun argued for it using general welfare and post roads clauses of the United States Constitution. Although he approved of the economic development goal, President James Madison vetoed the bill as unconstitutional. One of the most famous alleged pork-barrel projects was the Big Dig in Boston, Massachusetts. The Big Dig was a project to relocate an existing section of the Interstate Highway System underground. The official planning phase started in 1982; the construction work was done between 1991 and 2006; and the project concluded on December 31, 2007. It ended up costing US$14.6 billion, or over US$4 billion per mile. Tip O'Neill (D-Mass), after whom one of the Big Dig tunnels was named, pushed to have the Big Dig funded by the federal government while he was the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. During the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, the Gravina Island Bridge (also known as the \\"Bridge to Nowhere\\") in Alaska was cited as an example of pork barrel spending. The bridge, pushed for by Republican Senator Ted Stevens, was projected to cost $398 million and would connect the island's 50 residents and the Ketchikan International Airport to Revillagigedo Island and Ketchikan. Former Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye described himself as ‚Äúthe No. 1 earmarks guy in the U.S. Congress.‚Äù Inouye regularly passed earmarks for funding in the state of Hawaii including military and transportation spending. Pork-barrel projects, which differ from earmarks, are added to the federal budget by members of the appropriation committees of United States Congress. This allows delivery of federal funds to the local district or state of the appropriation committee member, often accommodating major campaign contributors. To a certain extent, a member of Congress is judged by their ability to deliver funds to their constituents. The Chairman and the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations are in a position to deliver significant benefits to their states. Researchers Anthony Fowler and Andrew B. Hall claim that this still does not account for the high reelection rates of incumbent representatives in American legislatures. The Madrid‚ÄìSeville high-speed line was a noted example of pork barrel politics in Spain. Pasqual Maragall revealed details of an unwritten agreement between him and Felipe Gonz√°lez, the prime minister at the time who was from Seville. The agreement was that Barcelona would receive the 1992 Summer Olympics and Seville would receive the high-speed railway line (which opened in 1992). This was in spite of position of the Madrid‚ÄìBarcelona high-speed rail line as Spain's most profitable high-speed line. Barcelona received its AVE connection in 2008, though with many advantages that the line to Seville does not have, e.g. full-speed bypasses LAV Madrid ‚Äì Sevilla and LAV Madrid ‚Äì Zaragoza ‚Äì Barcelona: the decision to construct the line to Seville was only taken in 1986 and construction was rushed, so that the line would be ready for the Seville Expo '92. Use of the term outside the United States In other countries, the practice is often called patronage, but this word does not always imply corrupt or undesirable conduct. = Australia = \\"Pork barrel\\" is frequently used in Australian politics, where marginal seats are often accused of receiving more funding than safe seats or, in the case of the 2010 election in negotiations with key independents, as well as in the 2019 election. = Central and Eastern Europe = Romanians speak of ' (literally, \\"electoral alms\\"), while the Polish ' means literally \\"election sausage\\". In Serbian, ' (\\"cutting the cake\\") refers to post-electoral distribution of state-funded positions for the loyal members of the winning party. The Czech ' (\\"pre-election goulash\\") has similar meaning, referring to free dishes of goulash served to potential voters during election campaign meetings targeted at lower social classes; metaphorically, it stands for any populistic political decisions that are taken before the elections with the aim of obtaining more votes. The process of diverting budget funds in favor of a project in a particular constituency is called ' (\\"portioning of the bear\\") in Czech usage. = India = In India, the term \\"pork barrel politics\\" has been employed to depict the pattern of distribution of discretionary grants by the national government (see for example Biswas et al. 2010; Rodden and Wilkinson 2004;Rodden and S. Wilkinson, 2005. The Shifting Political Economy of Redistribution in the Indian Federation Sharma, 2017. However (Sharma, 2017) is most explicit in drawing the parallel between the tactical distribution of grants in India and the notion of pork barrel politics. Chanchal Kumar Sharma demonstrates that the incentives of the Prime Minister's party under a coalition system create a universalisation effect which means \\"giving something to everyone\\". Thus, the states governed by non-affiliated parties do not suffer as much as in the dominant party era. In fact, a coalition party system limits opportunities to reward party loyalty (see Sharma 2017). =Ireland= The term parish pump politics is more commonly used in Ireland although Independent TD Shane Ross did refer to Pork Barrel politics at a press conference for the Independent Alliance in the run up to the 2016 general election, saying that the Alliance was \\"not interested in pork barrel politics\\".\\"Independents not interested in pork barrel politics says Shane Ross\\" Despite being appointed Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the 32nd D√°il he went on to prioritise the reopening of a police station in his own constituency which was eventually delivered on the eve of the election of new Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in June 2017. = German-speaking countries = The German language differentiates between campaign goodies (Wahlgeschenke, literally \\"election gifts\\") to occur around election dates and parish-pump politics (Kirchturmpolitik, literally \\"church tower politics\\") for concentrating funding and reliefs to the home constituency of a politician. While the former is a technical term (neutral or slightly derogatory) the latter is always derogatory meaning that the scope of actions is limited to an area where the steeple of the politician's village can still be seen. In Switzerland the wording of provincial thinking (Kant√∂nligeist, literally \\"cantonal mind\\") may cover these actions as well and it is understood as a synonym in Germany and Austria. = Philippines = Protest against pork barrel politics at the 2013 Million People March in Luneta In the Philippines, the term \\"pork barrel\\" is used to mean funds allocated to the members of the Philippine House of Representatives and the Philippine Senate to spend as they see fit without going through the normal budgetary process or through the Executive Branch. It can be used for both \\"hard\\" projects, such as buildings and roads, and \\"soft\\" projects, such as scholarships and medical expenses. The first pork barrel fund was introduced in 1922 with the passage of the first Public Works Act (Act No 3044). This pork barrel system was technically stopped by President Ferdinand Marcos during his dictatorship by abolishing Congress. It was reintroduced to the system after the restoration of the Congress in 1987. The program has had different names over the years, including the Countryside Development Fund, Congressional Initiative Fund, and currently the Priority Development Assistance Fund. Since 2006, the PDAF was ‚Ç±70.0 M for each Representative and ‚Ç±200.0 M for each Senator. During the presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, PDAF became the biggest source of corruption among the legislators. Kickbacks were common and became syndicated‚Äîusing pre-identified project implementers including government agencies, contractors and bogus non-profit corporations as well as the government's Commission on Audit. In August 2013, outrage over the ‚Ç±10 billion Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, involving Janet Lim-Napoles and numerous Senators and Representatives, led to widespread calls for abolition of the PDAF system. The so-called Million People March which occurred on August 26, 2013, National Heroes' Day in the Philippines, called for the end of \\"pork barrel\\" and was joined by simultaneous protests nationwide and by the Filipino diaspora around the world. Petitioners have challenged the constitutionality of the PDAF before the high court following reports of its widespread and systematic misuse by some members of Congress in cahoots with private individuals. Three incumbent senators and several former members of the House of Representatives have been named respondents in a plunder complaint filed with the Office of the Ombudsman in connection with the alleged ‚Ç±10 billion pork barrel scam. Public outrage over the anomaly has resulted in the largest protest gathering under the three-year-old Aquino administration. On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the controversial Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), or more commonly known as the pork barrel, as unconstitutional. In a briefing, the high court declared the PDAF Article in 2013 General Approriations Act and all similar provisions on the pork barrel system as illegal because it \\"allowed legislators to wield, in varying gradiations, non-oversight, post-enactment authority in vital areas of budget executions (thus violating) the principle of separation of powers\\". = Nordic countries = Similar expressions, meaning \\"election meat\\", are used in Danish ('), Swedish (') and Norwegian ('), where they mean promises made before an election, often by a politician who has little intention of fulfilling them.Nationalencyklopedin, NE Nationalencyklopedin AB. Article Valfl√§sk The Finnish political jargon uses ' (culvert politics) in reference to national politicians concentrating on small local matters, such as construction of roads and other public works at politician's home municipality. In Iceland, the term kj√∂rd√¶mapot refers to the practice of funneling public funds to key voting demographics in marginal constituencies. = United Kingdom = The term is rarely used in British English, although similar terms exist: election sweetener, tax sweetener, or just sweetener, which refers to the practise of a chancellor of the exchequer leaving room in their fiscal program to announce a big tax cut or spending boost in the budget immediately prior to an election, usually targeting a key voting demographic (such as the elderly) or benefitting marginal constituencies. The term \\"pork barrel\\" was, however, used in August 2013 by the Campaign for Better Transport in their criticism of Danny Alexander MP's involvement in securing funding for the A6 Manchester Airport Relief Road which passed through a marginal Liberal Democrat constituency. It was also used by Pete Wishart in the House of Commons on 26 June 2017 in reference to the deal between the Conservative Party and the Democratic Unionist Party to keep the former in power. In February 2019 it was used by shadow chancellor John McDonnell to criticise Theresa May‚Äôs rumoured attempts to persuade Labour MPs to vote for her Brexit deal.

As the daughter of missionaries, Buck spent most of her life before 1934 in Zhenjiang, China. Her novel The Good Earth was the best-selling fiction book in the United States in 1931 and 1932 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932. In 1938, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \\"for her rich and truly epic descriptions of peasant life in China and for her biographical masterpieces\\".The Nobel Prize in Literature 1938 Accessed 9 Mar 2013 She was the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. After returning to the United States in 1935, she continued writing prolifically, became a prominent advocate of the rights of women and minority groups, and wrote widely on Chinese and Asian cultures, becoming particularly well known for her efforts on behalf of Asian and mixed-race adoption. Early life The Stulting House at the Pearl Buck Birthplace in Hillsboro, West Virginia Originally named Comfort by her parents,Lian Xi, The Conversion of Missionaries, University Park, PA: Penn State University Press, 1996) 102 . Pearl Sydenstricker was born in Hillsboro, West Virginia, United States, to Caroline Maude (Stulting) (1857‚Äì1921) and Absalom Sydenstricker. Her parents, Southern Presbyterian missionaries, traveled to China soon after their marriage on July 8, 1880, but returned to the United States for Pearl's birth. When Pearl was five months old, the family arrived in China, first in Huai'an and then in 1896 moved to Zhenjiang (then often known as Jingjiang or, in the Chinese postal romanization system, Tsingkiang), near Nanking. (Entry for \\"Sydenstricker, Absalom\\") Of her siblings who survived into adulthood, Edgar Sydenstricker had a distinguished career with the United States Public Health Service and later the Milbank Memorial Fund and Grace Sydenstricker Yaukey (1899‚Äì1994) was a writer who wrote young adult books and books about Asia under the pen name Cornelia Spencer. Chinese man in Zhenjiang, Pearl recalled in her memoir that she lived in \\"several worlds\\", one a \\"small, white, clean Presbyterian world of my parents\\", and the other the \\"big, loving merry not- too-clean Chinese world\\", and there was no communication between them.Pearl S. Buck, My Several Worlds: A Personal Record (New York: John Day, 1954) p. 10. The Boxer Uprising greatly affected the family; their Chinese friends deserted them, and Western visitors decreased. Her father, convinced that no Chinese could wish him harm, stayed behind as the rest of the family went to Shanghai for safety. A few years later, Pearl was enrolled in Miss Jewell's School there and was dismayed at the racist attitudes of the other students, few of whom could speak any Chinese. Both of her parents felt strongly that Chinese were their equals (they forbade the use of the word heathen), and she was raised in a bilingual environment: tutored in English by her mother, in the local dialect by her Chinese playmates, and in classical Chinese by a Chinese scholar named Mr. Kung. She also read voraciously, especially, in spite of her father's disapproval, the novels of Charles Dickens, which she later said she read through once a year for the rest of her life.Peter Conn, Pearl S. Buck: A Cultural Biography, Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1996) 9, 19‚Äì23 . In 1911, Pearl left China to attend Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg, Virginia, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1914 and a member of Kappa Delta Sorority. Although she had not intended to return to China, much less become a missionary, she quickly applied to the Presbyterian Board when her father wrote that her mother was seriously ill. From 1914 to 1932, she served as a Presbyterian missionary, but her views later became highly controversial during the Fundamentalist‚ÄìModernist controversy, leading to her resignation.Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 70‚Äì82. Career in China In 1914, Pearl returned to China. She married an agricultural economist missionary, John Lossing Buck, on May 30, 1917, and they moved to Suzhou, Anhui Province, a small town on the Huai River (not to be confused with the better-known Suzhou in Jiangsu Province). This region she describes in her books The Good Earth and Sons. From 1920 to 1933, the Bucks made their home in Nanjing, on the campus of the University of Nanking, where they both had teaching positions. She taught English literature at the private, church-run University of Nanking, Ginling College and at the National Central University. In 1920, the Bucks had a daughter, Carol, afflicted with phenylketonuria. In 1921, Buck's mother died of a tropical disease, sprue, and shortly afterward her father moved in. In 1924, they left China for John Buck's year of sabbatical and returned to the United States for a short time, during which Pearl Buck earned her master's degree from Cornell University. In 1925, the Bucks adopted Janice (later surnamed Walsh). That autumn, they returned to China. The tragedies and dislocations that Buck suffered in the 1920s reached a climax in March 1927, during the \\"Nanking Incident\\". In a confused battle involving elements of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, Communist forces, and assorted warlords, several Westerners were murdered. Since her father Absalom insisted, as he had in 1900 in the face of the Boxers, the family decided to stay in Nanjing until the battle reached the city. When violence broke out, a poor Chinese family invited them to hide in their hut while the family house was looted. The family spent a day terrified and in hiding, after which they were rescued by American gunboats. They traveled to Shanghai and then sailed to Japan, where they stayed for a year, after which they moved back to Nanjing. Buck later said that this year in Japan showed her that not all Japanese were militarists. When she returned from Japan in late 1927, Buck devoted herself in earnest to the vocation of writing. Friendly relations with prominent Chinese writers of the time, such as Xu Zhimo and Lin Yutang, encouraged her to think of herself as a professional writer. She wanted to fulfill the ambitions denied to her mother, but she also needed money to support herself if she left her marriage, which had become increasingly lonely, and since the mission board could not provide it, she also needed money for Carol's specialized care. Buck went once more to the States in 1929 to find long-term care for Carol, and while there, Richard J. Walsh, editor at John Day publishers in New York, accepted her novel East Wind: West Wind. She and Walsh began a relationship that would result in marriage and many years of professional teamwork. Back in Nanking, she retreated every morning to the attic of her university bungalow and within the year completed the manuscript for The Good Earth.Conn, Pearl S. Buck, 345. Pearl Buck in 1932, about the time The Good Earth was published Photo: Arnold Genthe When John Lossing Buck took the family to Ithaca the next year, Pearl accepted an invitation to address a luncheon of Presbyterian women at the Astor Hotel in New York City. Her talk was titled \\"Is There a Case for the Foreign Missionary?\\" and her answer was a barely qualified \\"no\\". She told her American audience that she welcomed Chinese to share her Christian faith, but argued that China did not need an institutional church dominated by missionaries who were too often ignorant of China and arrogant in their attempts to control it. When the talk was published in Harper's Magazine,Pearl S. Buck, \\"Is There a Case for Foreign Missions?,\\" Harper's 166 (January 1933): 143‚Äì155. the scandalized reaction led Buck to resign her position with the Presbyterian Board. In 1934, Buck left China, believing she would return, while John Lossing Buck remained.Buck, Pearl S. The Good Earth. Ed. Peter Conn. New York: Washington Square Press, 1994. pp. xviii‚Äìxix. Career in the United States In 1935 the Bucks divorced in Reno, Nevada, and she married Richard Walsh that same day. He offered her advice and affection which, her biographer concludes, \\"helped make Pearl's prodigious activity possible\\". The couple lived in Pennsylvania until his death in 1960. During the Cultural Revolution, Buck, as a preeminent American writer of Chinese village life, was denounced as an \\"American cultural imperialist\\". Buck was \\"heartbroken\\" when she was prevented from visiting China with Richard Nixon in 1972. Her 1962 novel Satan Never Sleeps described the Communist tyranny in China. Following the Communist Revolution in 1949, Buck was repeatedly refused all attempts to return to her beloved China and therefore was compelled to remain in the United States for the rest of her life. Pearl S. Buck died of lung cancer on March 6, 1973, in Danby, Vermont, and was interred in Green Hills Farm in Perkasie, Pennsylvania. She designed her own tombstone. Her name was not inscribed in English on her tombstone. Instead, the grave marker is inscribed with Chinese characters representing the name Pearl Sydenstricker.Conn, Peter, Dragon and the Pearl Nobel Prize in Literature In 1938 the Nobel Prize committee in awarding the prize said: In her speech to the Academy, she took as her topic \\"The Chinese Novel.\\" She explained, \\"I am an American by birth and by ancestry\\", but \\"my earliest knowledge of story, of how to tell and write stories, came to me in China.\\" After an extensive discussion of classic Chinese novels, especially Romance of the Three Kingdoms, All Men Are Brothers, and Dream of the Red Chamber, she concluded that in China \\"the novelist did not have the task of creating art but of speaking to the people.\\" Her own ambition, she continued, had not been trained toward \\"the beauty of letters or the grace of art.\\" In China, the task of the novelist differed from the Western artist: \\"To farmers he must talk of their land, and to old men he must speak of peace, and to old women he must tell of their children, and to young men and women he must speak of each other.\\" And like the Chinese novelist, she concluded, \\"I have been taught to want to write for these people. If they are reading their magazines by the million, then I want my stories there rather than in magazines read only by a few.\\"Nobel Lecture (1938) The Chinese Novel Humanitarian efforts and later life Buck was highly committed to a range of issues that were largely ignored by her generation. Many of her life experiences and political views are described in her novels, short stories, fiction, children's stories, and the biographies of her parents entitled Fighting Angel (on Absalom) and The Exile (on Carrie). She wrote on diverse subjects, including women's rights, Asian cultures, immigration, adoption, missionary work, war, the atomic bomb (Command the Morning), and violence. Pearl S. Buck is receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature from King Gustav V of Sweden in the Stockholm Concert Hall in 1938 She was involved in the charity relief campaign for the victims of the 1931 China floods, writing a series of short stories describing the plight of refugees, which were broadcast on the radio in the United States and later published in her collected volume The First Wife and Other Stories.Courtney, Chris (2018), \\"The Nature of Disaster in China: The 1931 Central China Flood\\", Cambridge University Press [] In 1949, outraged that existing adoption services considered Asian and mixed-race children unadoptable, Buck co-founded Welcome House, Inc., the first international, interracial adoption agency, along with James A. Michener, Oscar Hammerstein II and his second wife Dorothy Hammerstein. In nearly five decades of work, Welcome House has placed over five thousand children. In 1964, to support kids who were not eligible for adoption, Buck established the Pearl S. Buck Foundation (name changed to Pearl S. Buck International in 1999) to \\"address poverty and discrimination faced by children in Asian countries\\". In 1964, she opened the Opportunity Center and Orphanage in South Korea, and later offices were opened in Thailand, the Philippines, and Vietnam. When establishing Opportunity House, Buck said, \\"The purpose ... is to publicize and eliminate injustices and prejudices suffered by children, who, because of their birth, are not permitted to enjoy the educational, social, economic and civil privileges normally accorded to children.\\"Pearl S. Buck International, \\"Our History ,\\" 2009. In 1960, after a long decline in health, her husband Richard died. She renewed a warm relation with William Ernest Hocking, who died in 1966. Buck then withdrew from many of her old friends and quarreled with others. In 1962 Buck asked the Israeli Government for clemency for Adolf Eichmann, the Nazi war criminal who was complicit in the deaths of five million Jews during WWII. In the late 1960s, Buck toured West Virginia to raise money to preserve her family farm in Hillsboro, West Virginia. Today the Pearl S. Buck Birthplace is a historic house museum and cultural center. She hoped the house would \\"belong to everyone who cares to go there\\", and serve as a \\"gateway to new thoughts and dreams and ways of life\\".Buck, Pearl S. My Mother's House. Richwood, WV: Appalachian Press. pp. 30‚Äì31. Long before it was considered fashionable or politically safe to do so, Buck challenged the American public by raising consciousness on topics such as racism, sex discrimination and the plight of Asian war children. During her life, Buck combined the careers of wife, mother, author, editor, international spokesperson, and political activist.Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xv‚Äìxvi. Final years In the mid-1960s, Buck increasingly came under the influence of Theodore Harris, a former dance instructor, who became her confidant, co-author, and financial advisor. She soon depended on him for all her daily routines, and placed him in control of Welcome House and the Pearl S. Buck Foundation. Harris, who was given a lifetime salary as head of the foundation, created a scandal for Buck when he was accused of mismanaging the foundation, diverting large amounts of the foundation's funds for his friends' and his own personal expenses, and treating staff poorly. Buck defended Harris, stating that he was \\"very brilliant, very high strung and artistic\\". Before her death Buck signed over her foreign royalties and her personal possessions to Creativity Inc., a foundation controlled by Harris, leaving her children a relatively small percentage of her estate. Buck died on March 6, 1973, from lung cancer. After her death, Buck's children contested the will and accused Harris of exerting \\"undue influence\\" on Buck during the last few years. Harris failed to appear at trial and the court ruled in the family's favor. Legacy Pearl S. Buck's former residence at Nanjing University A statue of Pearl S. Buck stands in front of the former residence at Nanjing University Many contemporary reviewers were positive and praised her \\"beautiful prose\\", even though her \\"style is apt to degenerate into over-repetition and confusion\\". Robert Benchley wrote a parody of The Good Earth that focused on just these qualities. Peter Conn, in his biography of Buck, argues that despite the accolades awarded to her, Buck's contribution to literature has been mostly forgotten or deliberately ignored by America's cultural gatekeepers.Conn, Pearl S. Buck, xii‚Äìxiv. Kang Liao argues that Buck played a \\"pioneering role in demythologizing China and the Chinese people in the American mind\\". Phyllis Bentley, in an overview of Buck's work published in 1935, was altogether impressed: \\"But we may say at least that for the interest of her chosen material, the sustained high level of her technical skill, and the frequent universality of her conceptions, Mrs. Buck is entitled to take rank as a considerable artist. To read her novels is to gain not merely knowledge of China but wisdom about life.\\" These works aroused considerable popular sympathy for China, and helped foment poor relations with Japan. Chinese- American author Anchee Min said she \\"broke down and sobbed\\" after reading The Good Earth for the first time as an adult, which she had been forbidden to read growing up in China during the Cultural Revolution. Min said Buck portrayed the Chinese peasants \\"with such love, affection and humanity\\" and it inspired Min's novel Pearl of China (2010), a fictional biography about Buck.NPR, \\"A Chinese Fan Of Pearl S. Buck Returns The Favor\\", All Things Considered, April 7, 2010. Accessed 7/4/10 In 1973, Buck was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame. Buck was honored in 1983 with a 5¬¢ Great Americans series postage stamp issued by the United States Postal Service In 1999 she was designated a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. Buck's former residence at Nanjing University is now the Sai Zhenzhu Memorial House along the West Wall of the university's north campus. U.S. President George H. W. Bush toured the Pearl S. Buck House in October 1998. He expressed that he, like millions of other Americans, had gained an appreciation for the Chinese people through Buck's writing. Pearl Buck's papers and literary manuscripts are currently housed at Pearl S. Buck International and the West Virginia & Regional History Center.

It is situated on the little River Lauter close to the border between France and Germany approximately north of Strasbourg and west of Karlsruhe. Wissembourg is a sub-prefecture of the department. The name Wissembourg is a Gallicized version of Wei√üenburg (Weissenburg) in German meaning \\"white castle\\". The Latin place-name, sometimes used in ecclesiastical sources, is Sebusium.Sebastian Franck, Germaniae Chronicon (Westermair 1538), p. CCCV verso. Jaucourt, L'Encylop√©die, 1st ed. (1751), Vol. XVII, pp. 595‚Äì96. The town was annexed by France after 1648 but then incorporated into Germany in 1871. It was returned to France in 1919, but reincorporated back into Germany on 1940. After 1944 it again became French. History Town hall Maison du sel Wissembourg Weissenburg (later Wissembourg) Abbey, the Benedictine abbey around which the town has grown, was founded in the 7th century, perhaps under the patronage of Dagobert I. The abbey was supported by vast territories. Of the 11th-century buildings constructed under the direction of Abbot Samuel, only the Schartenturm and some moats remain. The town was fortified in the 13th century. The abbey church of Saint-Pierre et Paul erected in the same century under the direction of Abbot Edelin was secularized in the French Revolution and despoiled of its treasures; in 1803 it became the parish church, resulting in the largest parish church of Alsace, only exceeded in size by the cathedral of Strasbourg. At the abbey in the late 9th century the monk Otfried composed a gospel harmony, the first substantial work of verse in German. In 1354 Charles IV made it one of the grouping of ten towns called the D√©capole that survived annexation by France under Louis XIV in 1678 and was extinguished with the French Revolution. On 25 January 1677 a great fire destroyed many houses and the H√¥tel de Ville; its replacement dates from 1741‚Äì52. Many early structures were spared: the Maison du Sel (1448), under its Alsatian pitched roof was the first hospital of the town. There are many 15th and 16th-century timber-frame houses, and parts of the walls and gateways of the town. The Maison de Stanislas was the retreat of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski, ex-king of Poland, from 1719 to 1725, when the formal request arrived, 3 April 1725 asking for the hand of his daughter in marriage to Louis XV. The First Battle of Wissembourg took place near the town in 1793. The ‚ÄúLines of Wissembourg,‚Äù () () originally made by Villars in 1706, were famous. They were a line of works extending to Lauterbourg nine miles to the southeast. Like the fortifications of the town, only vestiges remain, although the city wall is still intact for stretches. Austrian General von Wurmser succeeded in briefly capturing the lines in October 1793, but was defeated two months later by General Pichegru of the French Army and forced to retreat, along with the Prussians, across the Rhine River.www.retrobibliotek.de Wissembourg formed the setting for the Romantic novel L‚Äôami Fritz (1869) co-written by the team of Erckmann and Chatrian, which provided the material for Mascagni's opera L'Amico Fritz. Another Battle of Wissembourg took place on 4 August 1870. It was the first battle of the Franco-Prussian War. The Prussians were nominally commanded by the Crown Prince Frederick, but ably directed by his Chief of Staff, General Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal. The French defeat allowed the Prussian army to move into France. The Geisberg monument commemorates the battle; the town's cemetery holds large numbers of soldiers, including the stately tomb of French general Abel Douay who was killed in combat.

The 13th century Dominican church now serves as the cultural center 'La Nef'. The Grenier aux D√Æmes (tithe barn) belonging to the Abbey is 18th-century but an ancient foundation.

Consensus decision-making or consensus politics (often abbreviated to consensus) refers to group decision-making processes in which participants develop and decide on proposals with the aim, or requirement, of acceptance by all. The focus on avoiding negative opinion differentiates consensus from unanimity, which requires all participants to positively support a decision. Consensus comes from Latin meaning \\"agreement, accord,\\" which in turn comes from consentire, meaning \\"feel together\\". Both the process and outcome of consensus decision-making are referred to as consensus (e.g. \\"by consensus\\" and \\"a consensus\\" respectively). Objectives Characteristics of consensus decision-making include: *Collaborative: Participants contribute to a shared proposal and shape it into a decision that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible. *Cooperative: Participants in an effective consensus process should strive to reach the best possible decision for the group and all of its members, rather than competing for personal preferences. *Egalitarian: All members of a consensus decision- making body should be afforded, as much as possible, equal input into the process. All members have the opportunity to present, and amend proposals. *Inclusive: As many stakeholders as possible should be involved in the consensus decision-making process. *Participatory: The consensus process should actively solicit the input and participation of all decision-makers. Alternative to common decision-making practices Consensus decision-making is an alternative to commonly practiced group decision-making processes. Robert's Rules of Order, for instance, is a guide book used by many organizations. This book allows the structuring of debate and passage of proposals that can be approved through majority vote. It does not emphasize the goal of full agreement. Critics of such a process believe that it can involve adversarial debate and the formation of competing factions. These dynamics may harm group member relationships and undermine the ability of a group to cooperatively implement a contentious decision. Consensus decision- making attempts to address the beliefs of such problems. Proponents claim that outcomes of the consensus process include: *Better decisions: Through including the input of all stakeholders the resulting proposals may better address all potential concerns. *Better implementation: A process that includes and respects all parties, and generates as much agreement as possible sets the stage for greater cooperation in implementing the resulting decisions. *Better group relationships: A cooperative, collaborative group atmosphere can foster greater group cohesion and interpersonal connection. Decision rules Consensus is not synonymous with \\"unanimity\\"- though that may be a rule agreed to in a decision making process. The level of agreement necessary to finalize a decision is known as a \\"decision rule\\". Blocking and other forms of dissent To ensure the agreement or consent of all participants is valued, many groups choose unanimity or near-unanimity as their decision rule. Groups that require unanimity allow individual participants the option of blocking a group decision. This provision motivates a group to make sure that all group members consent to any new proposal before it is adopted. Proper guidelines for the use of this option, however, are important. The ethics of consensus decision-making encourage participants to place the good of the whole group above their own individual preferences. When there is potential for a block to a group decision, both the group and dissenters in the group are encouraged to collaborate until agreement can be reached. Simply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking. Some common guidelines for the use of consensus blocking include: *Providing an option for those who do not support a proposal to ‚Äústand aside‚Äù rather than block. *Requiring a block from two or more people to put a proposal aside. *Requiring the blocking party to supply an alternative proposal or a process for generating one. *Limiting each person's option to block consensus to a handful of times in one's life. *Limiting the option of blocking to decisions that are substantial to the mission or operation of the group and not allowing blocking on routine decisions. *Limiting the allowable rationale for blocking to issues that are fundamental to the group's mission or potentially disastrous to the group. =Dissent options= A participant who does not support a proposal may have alternatives to simply blocking it. Some common options may include the ability to: *Declare reservations: Group members who are willing to let a motion pass but desire to register their concerns with the group may choose \\"declare reservations.\\" If there are significant reservations about a motion, the decision-making body may choose to modify or re-word the proposal. *Stand aside: A \\"stand aside\\" may be registered by a group member who has a \\"serious personal disagreement\\" with a proposal, but is willing to let the motion pass. Although stand asides do not halt a motion, it is often regarded as a strong \\"nay vote\\" and the concerns of group members standing aside are usually addressed by modifications to the proposal. Stand asides may also be registered by users who feel they are incapable of adequately understanding or participating in the proposal. *Object: Any group member may \\"object\\" to a proposal. In groups with a unanimity decision rule, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal. Other decision rules may require more than one objection for a proposal to be blocked or not pass (see previous section, ). Process models The basic model for achieving consensus as defined by any decision rule involves: *Collaboratively generating a proposal *Identifying unsatisfied concerns *Modifying the proposal to generate as much agreement as possible All attempts at achieving consensus begin with a good faith attempt at generating full- agreement, regardless of decision rule threshold. =Specific models= In the ' model, affinity groups make joint decisions by each designating a speaker and sitting behind that circle of spokespeople, akin to the spokes of a wheel. While speaking rights might be limited to each group's designee, the meeting may allot breakout time for the constituent groups to discuss an issue and return to the circle via their spokesperson. In the case of an activist spokescouncil preparing for the A16 Washington D.C. protests in 2000, affinity groups disputed their spokescouncil's imposition of nonviolence in their action guidelines. They received the reprieve of letting groups self-organize their protests, and as the city's protest was subsequently divided into pie slices, each blockaded by an affinity group's choice of protest. Many of the participants learned about the spokescouncil model on the fly by participating in it directly, and came to better understand their planned action by hearing others' concerns and voicing their own. Consensus voting The group first elects, say, three referees or consensors. The debate on the chosen problem is initiated by the facilitator calling for proposals. Every proposed option is accepted if the referees decide it is relevant and conforms with the UN Charter on Human Rights. The referees produce and display a list of these options. The debate proceeds, with queries, comments, criticisms and/or even new options. If the debate fails to come to a verbal consensus, the referees draw up a final list of options - usually between 4 and 6 - to represent the debate. When all agree, the chair calls for a preferential vote, as per the rules for a Modified Borda Count, MBC. The referees decide which option, or which composite of the two leading options, is the outcome. If its level of support surpasses a minimum consensus coefficient, it may be adopted. Blocking Flowchart of basic consensus decision-making process. Groups that require unanimity commonly use a core set of procedures depicted in this flow chart. Once an agenda for discussion has been set and, optionally, the ground rules for the meeting have been agreed upon, each item of the agenda is addressed in turn. Typically, each decision arising from an agenda item follows through a simple structure: *Discussion of the item: The item is discussed with the goal of identifying opinions and information on the topic at hand. The general direction of the group and potential proposals for action are often identified during the discussion. *Formation of a proposal: Based on the discussion a formal decision proposal on the issue is presented to the group. *Call for consensus: The facilitator of the decision-making body calls for consensus on the proposal. Each member of the group usually must actively state whether they agree or consent, stand aside, or object, often by using a hand gesture or raising a colored card, to avoid the group interpreting silence or inaction as agreement. The number of objections is counted to determine if this step's consent threshold is satisfied. If it is, dissenters are asked to share their concerns with proceeding with the agreement, so that any potential harms can be addressed/minimized. This can happen even if the consent threshold is unanimity, especially if many voters stand aside. *Identification and addressing of concerns: If consensus is not achieved, each dissenter presents his or her concerns on the proposal, potentially starting another round of discussion to address or clarify the concern. *Modification of the proposal: The proposal is amended, re-phrased or ridered in an attempt to address the concerns of the decision-makers. The process then returns to the call for consensus and the cycle is repeated until a satisfactory decision passes the consent threshold for the group. Quaker-based model Quaker- based consensus is said to be effective because it puts in place a simple, time-tested structure that moves a group towards unity. The Quaker model is intended to allow hearing individual voices while providing a mechanism for dealing with disagreements. The Quaker model has been adapted by Earlham College for application to secular settings, and can be effectively applied in any consensus decision-making process. Its process includes: *Multiple concerns and information are shared until the sense of the group is clear. *Discussion involves active listening and sharing information. *Norms limit number of times one asks to speak to ensure that each speaker is fully heard. *Ideas and solutions belong to the group; no names are recorded. *Ideally, differences are resolved by discussion. The facilitator (\\"clerk\\" or \\"convenor\\" in the Quaker model) identifies areas of agreement and names disagreements to push discussion deeper. *The facilitator articulates the sense of the discussion, asks if there are other concerns, and proposes a \\"minute\\" of the decision. *The group as a whole is responsible for the decision and the decision belongs to the group. *The facilitator can discern if one who is not uniting with the decision is acting without concern for the group or in selfish interest. *Ideally, all dissenters' perspectives are synthesized into the final outcome for a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. *Should some dissenter's perspective not harmonize with the others, that dissenter may \\"stand aside\\" to allow the group to proceed, or may opt to \\"block\\". \\"Standing aside\\" implies a certain form of silent consent. Some groups allow \\"blocking\\" by even a single individual to halt or postpone the entire process. Key components of Quaker-based consensus include a belief in a common humanity and the ability to decide together. The goal is \\"unity, not unanimity.\\" Ensuring that group members speak only once until others are heard encourages a diversity of thought. The facilitator is understood as serving the group rather than acting as person-in-charge. In the Quaker model, as with other consensus decision-making processes, articulating the emerging consensus allows members to be clear on the decision in front of them. As members' views are taken into account they are likely to support it. Roles The consensus decision-making process often has several roles designed to make the process run more effectively. Although the name and nature of these roles varies from group to group, the most common are the facilitator, consensor, a timekeeper, an empath and a secretary or notes taker. Not all decision-making bodies use all of these roles, although the facilitator position is almost always filled, and some groups use supplementary roles, such as a Devil's advocate or greeter. Some decision-making bodies rotate these roles through the group members in order to build the experience and skills of the participants, and prevent any perceived concentration of power. The common roles in a consensus meeting are: *Facilitator: As the name implies, the role of the facilitator is to help make the process of reaching a consensus decision easier. Facilitators accept responsibility for moving through the agenda on time; ensuring the group adheres to the mutually agreed-upon mechanics of the consensus process; and, if necessary, suggesting alternate or additional discussion or decision- making techniques, such as go-arounds, break-out groups or role-playing. Some consensus groups use two co-facilitators. Shared facilitation is often adopted to diffuse the perceived power of the facilitator and create a system whereby a co-facilitator can pass off facilitation duties if he or she becomes more personally engaged in a debate. *Consensor: The team of consensors is responsible for accepting those relevant proposals which conform with the UN Charter on Human Rights; for displaying an initial list of these options; for drawing up a balanced list of options to represent the entire debate; to analyse the preferences cast in any subsequent MBC ballot; and, if need be, to determine the composite decision from the two most popular options. *Timekeeper: The purpose of the timekeeper is to ensure the decision-making body keeps to the schedule set in the agenda. Effective timekeepers use a variety of techniques to ensure the meeting runs on time including: giving frequent time updates, ample warning of short time, and keeping individual speakers from taking an excessive amount of time. *Empath or vibe watch: The empath, or 'vibe watch' as the position is sometimes called, is charged with monitoring the 'emotional climate' of the meeting, taking note of the body language and other non-verbal cues of the participants. Defusing potential emotional conflicts, maintaining a climate free of intimidation and being aware of potentially destructive power dynamics, such as sexism or racism within the decision-making body, are the primary responsibilities of the empath. *Note taker: The role of the notes taker or secretary is to document the decisions, discussion and action points of the decision-making body. Tools and methods Front face, back face and embossing mask for colored consensus cards * Some consensus decision-making bodies use a system of colored cards to indicate speaker priority. For instance, red cards to indicate feedback on a breach in rules or decorum, yellow cards for clarifying questions, and green cards for desire to speak. * Hand signals are another method for reading a room's positions nonverbally. They work well with groups of fewer than 250 people and especially with multi-lingual groups. The nature and meaning of individual gestures varies between groups, but a widely adopted core set of hand signals include: wiggling of the fingers on both hands, a gesture sometimes referred to as \\"twinkling\\", to indicate agreement; raising a fist or crossing both forearms with hands in fists to indicate a block or strong disagreement; and making a \\"T\\" shape with both hands, the \\"time out\\" gesture, to call attention to a point of process or order. One common set of hand signals is called the \\"Fist-to-Five\\" or \\"Fist-of-Five\\". In this method each member of the group can hold up a fist to indicate blocking consensus, one finger to suggest changes, two fingers to discuss minor issues, three fingers to indicate willingness to let issue pass without further discussion, four fingers to affirm the decision as a good idea, and five fingers to volunteer to take a lead in implementing the decision. A similar set of hand signals are used by the Occupy Wall Street protesters in their group negotiations. * First-past-the-post is used as a fall-back method when consensus cannot be reached within a given time frame. If the potential outcome of the fall-back method can be anticipated, then those who support that outcome have incentives to block consensus so that the fall-back method gets applied. Special fall-back methods have been developed that reduce this incentive. Criticism=Criticism of blocking= Critics of consensus blocking often observe that the option, while potentially effective for small groups of motivated or trained individuals with a sufficiently high degree of affinity, has a number of possible shortcomings, notably *Preservation of the status quo: In decision-making bodies that use formal consensus, the ability of individuals or small minorities to block agreement gives an enormous advantage to anyone who supports the existing state of affairs. This can mean that a specific state of affairs can continue to exist in an organization long after a majority of members would like it to change. The incentive to block can however be removed by using a special kind of voting process. *Susceptibility to widespread disagreement: Giving the right to block proposals to all group members may result in the group becoming hostage to an inflexible minority or individual. When a popular proposal is blocked the group actually experiences widespread disagreement, the opposite of the consensus process's goal. Furthermore, \\"opposing such obstructive behavior [can be] construed as an attack on freedom of speech and in turn [harden] resolve on the part of the individual to defend his or her position.\\" As a result, consensus decision-making has the potential to reward the least accommodating group members while punishing the most accommodating. *Stagnation and group dysfunction: When groups cannot make the decisions necessary to function (because they cannot resolve blocks), they may lose effectiveness in accomplishing their mission. *Susceptibility to splitting and excluding members: When high levels of group member frustration result from blocked decisions or inordinately long meetings, members may leave the group, try to get to others to leave, or limit who has entry to the group. *Channeling decisions away from an inclusive group process: When group members view the status quo as unjustly difficult to change through a whole group process, they may begin to delegate decision-making to smaller committees or to an executive committee. In some cases members begin to act unilaterally because they are frustrated with a stagnated group process. =Groupthink= Consensus seeks to improve solidarity in the long run. Accordingly, it should not be confused with unanimity in the immediate situation, which is often a symptom of groupthink. Studies of effective consensus process usually indicate a shunning of unanimity or \\"illusion of unanimity\\" that does not hold up as a group comes under real-world pressure (when dissent reappears). Cory Doctorow, Ralph Nader and other proponents of deliberative democracy or judicial-like methods view explicit dissent as a symbol of strength. In his book about Wikipedia, Joseph Reagle considers the merits and challenges of consensus in open and online communities. Available for free download in multiple formats at: . Randy Schutt, Starhawk and other practitioners of direct action focus on the hazards of apparent agreement followed by action in which group splits become dangerously obvious. Unanimous, or apparently unanimous, decisions can have drawbacks. They may be symptoms of a systemic bias, a rigged process (where an agenda is not published in advance or changed when it becomes clear who is present to consent), fear of speaking one's mind, a lack of creativity (to suggest alternatives) or even a lack of courage (to go further along the same road to a more extreme solution that would not achieve unanimous consent). Unanimity is achieved when the full group apparently consents to a decision. It has disadvantages insofar as further disagreement, improvements or better ideas then remain hidden, but effectively ends the debate moving it to an implementation phase. Some consider all unanimity a form of groupthink, and some experts propose \\"coding systems ... for detecting the illusion of unanimity symptom\\". In Consensus is not Unanimity, consensus practitioner and activist leader Starhawk wrote: Confusion between unanimity and consensus, in other words, usually causes consensus decision-making to fail, and the group then either reverts to majority or supermajority rule or disbands. Most robust models of consensus exclude uniformly unanimous decisions and require at least documentation of minority concerns. Some state clearly that unanimity is not consensus but rather evidence of intimidation, lack of imagination, lack of courage, failure to include all voices, or deliberate exclusion of the contrary views. =Criticism of majority voting processes= Some proponents of consensus decision-making view procedures that use majority rule as undesirable for several reasons. Majority voting is regarded as competitive, rather than cooperative, framing decision-making in a win/lose dichotomy that ignores the possibility of compromise or other mutually beneficial solutions. Carlos Santiago Nino, on the other hand, has argued that majority rule leads to better deliberation practice than the alternatives, because it requires each member of the group to make arguments that appeal to at least half the participants. A. Lijphart reaches the same conclusion about majority rule, noting that majority rule encourages coalition-building. Additionally, opponents of majority rule claim that it can lead to a \\"tyranny of the majority\\", a scenario in which a majority places its interests so far above those of an individual or minority group as to constitute active oppression. Some voting theorists, however, argue that majority rule may actually prevent tyranny of the majority, in part because it maximizes the potential for a minority to form a coalition that can overturn an unsatisfactory decision. Some advocates of consensus would assert that a majority decision reduces the commitment of each individual decision-maker to the decision. Members of a minority position may feel less commitment to a majority decision, and even majority voters who may have taken their positions along party or bloc lines may have a sense of reduced responsibility for the ultimate decision. The result of this reduced commitment, according to many consensus proponents, is potentially less willingness to defend or act upon the decision. Majority voting cannot measure consensus. Indeed,--so many 'for' and so many 'against' --it measures the very opposite, the degree of dissent. Consensus voting, in contrast, the Modified Borda Count, MBC, can identify the consensus of any electorate, whenever such a consensus exists. Furthermore, the rules laid down for this procedure can be the very catalyst of consensus. =Additional critical perspectives= Some formal models based on graph theory attempt to explore the implications of suppressed dissent and subsequent sabotage of the group as it takes action. High-stakes decision-making, such as judicial decisions of appeals courts, always require some such explicit documentation. Consent however is still observed that defies factional explanations. Nearly 40% of the decisions of the United States Supreme Court, for example, are unanimous, though often for widely varying reasons. \\"Consensus in Supreme Court voting, particularly the extreme consensus of unanimity, has often puzzled Court observers who adhere to ideological accounts of judicial decision making.\\" Historical evidence is mixed on whether particular Justices' views were suppressed in favour of public unity. Another method to promote agreement is to use a voting process under which all members of the group have a strategic incentive to agree rather than block. However, this makes it very difficult to tell the difference between those who support the decision and those who merely tactically tolerate it for the incentive. Once they receive that incentive, they may undermine or refuse to implement the agreement in various and non-obvious ways. In general voting systems avoid allowing offering incentives (or \\"bribes\\") to change a heartfelt vote. In the Abilene paradox, a group can unanimously agree on a course of action that no individual member of the group desires because no one individual is willing to go against the perceived will of the decision-making body. Since consensus decision-making focuses on discussion and seeks the input of all participants, it can be a time-consuming process. This is a potential liability in situations where decisions must be made speedily, or where it is not possible to canvass opinions of all delegates in a reasonable time. Additionally, the time commitment required to engage in the consensus decision-making process can sometimes act as a barrier to participation for individuals unable or unwilling to make the commitment. However, once a decision has been reached it can be acted on more quickly than a decision handed down. American businessmen complained that in negotiations with a Japanese company, they had to discuss the idea with everyone even the janitor, yet once a decision was made the Americans found the Japanese were able to act much quicker because everyone was on board, while the Americans had to struggle with internal opposition.  Examples  Outside of Western culture, multiple other cultures have used consensus decision-making. One early example is the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Confederacy Grand Council, which used a 75% supermajority to finalize its decisions, potentially as early as 1142. In the Xulu and Xhosa (South African) process of indaba, community leaders gather to listen to the public and negotiate figurative thresholds towards an acceptable compromise. The technique was also used during the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In Aceh and Nias cultures (Indonesian), family and regional disputes, from playground fights to estate inheritance, are handled through a musyawarah consensus-building process in which parties mediate to find peace and avoid future hostility and revenge. The resulting agreements are expected to be followed, and range from advice and warnings to compensation and exile. Consensus-building and direct democracy experimentation was a feature of voter registration projects by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the American South; the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP) of Students for a Democratic Society (mid-1960s), some women's liberation groups (late 1960s to early 1970s) and anti-nuclear and peace movement groups (late 1970s and early 1980s). For example, the anti-nuclear Clamshell Alliance and Movement for a New Society engaged in consensus decision-making processes. The origins of formal consensus-making can be traced significantly further back, to the Religious Society of Friends, or Quakers, who adopted the technique as early as the 17th century. Anabaptists, including some Mennonites, have a history of using consensus decision-making and some believe Anabaptists practiced consensus as early as the Martyrs' Synod of 1527. Some Christians trace consensus decision-making back to the Bible. The Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia references, in particular, Acts 15 as an example of consensus in the New Testament. The lack of legitimate consensus process in the unanimous conviction of Jesus by corrupt priests in an illegally held Sanhedrin court (which had rules preventing unanimous conviction in a hurried process) strongly influenced the views of pacifist Protestants, including the Anabaptists (Mennonites/Amish), Quakers and Shakers. In particular it influenced their distrust of expert-led courtrooms and to \\"be clear about process\\" and convene in a way that assures that \\"everyone must be heard\\". Consensus voting was advocated, among others, by Ram√≥n Llull in 1199, by Nicholas Cusanus in 1435, by Jean-Charles de Borda in 1784, by Hother Hage in 1860, by Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) in 1884, and by Peter Emerson in 1986. =Japanese business= Japanese companies normally use consensus decision-making, meaning that unanimous support on the board of directors is sought for any decision. A ringi-sho is a circulation document used to obtain agreement. It must first be signed by the lowest level manager, and then upwards, and may need to be revised and the process started over. =IETF rough consensus model= In the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), decisions are assumed to be taken by rough consensus. The IETF has studiously refrained from defining a mechanical method for verifying such consensus, apparently in the belief that any such codification leads to attempts to \\"game the system.\\" Instead, a working group (WG) chair or BoF chair is supposed to articulate the \\"sense of the group.\\" One tradition in support of rough consensus is the tradition of humming rather than (countable) hand-raising; this allows a group to quickly discern the prevalence of dissent, without making it easy to slip into majority rule. Much of the business of the IETF is carried out on mailing lists, where all parties can speak their views at all times. =Social constructivism model= In 2001, Robert Rocco Cottone published a consensus-based model of professional decision-making for counselors and psychologists. Based on social constructivist philosophy, the model operates as a consensus-building model, as the clinician addresses ethical conflicts through a process of negotiating to consensus. Conflicts are resolved by consensually agreed on arbitrators who are selected early in the negotiation process. =US Bureau of Land Management collaborative stakeholder engagement= The United States Bureau of Land Management's policy is to seek to use collaborative stakeholder engagement as standard operating practice for natural resources projects, plans, and decision-making except under unusual conditions such as when constrained by law, regulation, or other mandates or when conventional processes are important for establishing new, or reaffirming existing, precedent. =Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth= The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth of 1569‚Äì1795 used consensus decision-making in the form of liberum veto ('free veto') in its Sejms (legislative assemblies). A type of unanimous consent, the liberum veto originally allowed any member of a Sejm to veto an individual law by shouting Sisto activitatem! (Latin: \\"I stop the activity!\\") or Nie pozwalam! (Polish: \\"I do not allow!\\"). Over time it developed into a much more extreme form, where any Sejm member could unilaterally and immediately force the end of the current session and nullify any previously passed legislation from that session. Due to excessive use and intentional sabotage from neighboring powers bribing Sejm members, legislating became very difficult and weakened the Commonwealth. Soon after the Commonwealth banned liberum veto as part of its Constitution of 3 May 1791, it dissolved under pressure from neighboring powers.

He has directed three documentaries which have gone on to win Oscars, across three different decades. Educated at Harvard, Harris co-produced the short The Redwoods for the Sierra Club with Trevor Greenwood; the short won the 1967 Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject. The aforementioned Into The Arms and Long Way Home also landed Academy Awards. Harris started out as a crime reporter for the Chicago City News Bureau, and reports that on his first story he went into a police station and had his car stolen from in front of it. The police called him a few weeks later to ask if he had found his car. Harris tried investigative journalism next but quit after realizing he did not like to embarrass people. Harris believes that filmmakers can construct a cinema verite film beforehand by considering repeatable events‚Äîthat is, by determining which events are likely to recur frequently, and being there to film those events when they do. He tested this theory on a film on the Peace Corps in Colombia, in a small village 50 miles outside Bogot√°. The film was not especially positive about the Peace Corps experience; the Peace Corps decided not to use it for recruiting, but to use it for training people who have been in for about a year. Harris has also directed a film on migrant farmworkers and their dismal wages and living conditions;one of the \\"stars\\" of his documentary was Luis Valdez, who went on to direct the film La Bamba. Harris' film The Long Way Home deals with the experience of Jewish refugees after World War II. Spike Lee condemned the second half of the film as propaganda for the state of Israel; nonetheless the film won an Oscar in 1997 for Best Documentary. Harris next directed a film less complimentary towards the state, which had been commissioned specifically for the 50th anniversary of Israel. Harris intended the film, A Dream No More, to reflect Israel, \\"warts and all\\"; he spent 15 months and nearly $1.5 million U.S. making the film, which went over deadline as he tried to determine final structure for the film. He turned in a final print and had the film flagged the next day; it was never shown. Harris considers this film the second of his \\"Jewish trilogy\\". Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport, the third part of the trilogy, tells the stories of several people whose parents sent them on the kindertransport to escape the Germans, as well as one woman who was meant to go and did not because her father pulled her off the train. The film won the 2000 Academy Award for Documentary Feature. In 2003, Harris wrote Unchained Memories: Readings from the Slave Narratives. He was nominated for outstanding writing for non-fiction writing for this documentary. As a documentary filmmaker, Harris casts his films carefully, talking to people beforehand and deciding who has an interesting story and who tells it well on camera. He also refuses to start filming immediately, but prefers to talk with the subjects for about an hour beforehand. He is currently the producer of a documentary called \\"With One Hand Tied\\", which is based on the book \\"Black Warriors: The Buffalo Soldiers of World War II\\". Harris is also the author of various children's books, a side career he stumbled into the mid-1980s: he returned to journalism because he could not find funding for a documentary he wanted to make. After writing an article about a young child, he was contacted by an agent who asked him to write children's literature and has since written several children's books. Harris is currently a professor at the School of Cinematic Arts of the University of Southern California.

Sculpture is among the oldest of the arts. Even before painting cave walls, early humans fashioned shapes from stone. From these beginnings, artifacts have evolved to their current complexity. Material origin and qualities Thomas Ridgeway Gould, The West Wind. (frontal view) 1876 Marble is a metamorphic rock derived from limestone, composed mostly of calcite (a crystalline form of calcium carbonate, CaCO3). The original source of the parent limestone is the seabed deposition of calcium carbonate in the form of microscopic animal skeletons or similar materials. Marble is formed when the limestone is transformed by heat and pressure after being overlain by other materials. The finest marbles for sculpture have no or few stains, though natural stains can be incorporated into the work itself. =Advantages= Among the commonly available stones, only marble has a slight translucency i.e. subsurface scattering that is comparable to that of human skin. It is this translucency that gives a marble sculpture a visual depth beyond its surface and this evokes a certain realism when used for figurative works. Marble also has the advantage that, when first quarried, it is relatively soft and easy to work, refine, and polish. As the finished marble ages, it becomes harder and more durable. Preference to the cheaper and less translucent limestone is based largely on the fineness of marble's grain, which enables the sculptor to render minute detail in a manner not always possible with limestone. In contrast to limestone, marble is also extremely weather- resistant. As a result, surface changes due to the immediate environment are not always visible to the naked eye. This feature can pose challenges when dating ancient works. =Disadvantages= Thomas Ridgeway Gould. The West Wind. (profile) 1876. Marble does not bear handling well as it will absorb skin oils when touched, which leads to yellow brownish staining. While more resistant than limestone it is subject to attack by weak acids, and so performs poorly in outdoor environments subject to acid rain. For severe environments, granite is a more lasting material but one which is far more difficult to work and much less suitable for refined works. Compared to metals such as bronze, furthermore, marble is inflexible and vulnerable to fracturing. This drawback means that sculptors must incorporate specific supporting features into the sculpture to prevent collapse. In Thomas Ridgeway Gould's The West Wind, for example, he poised the figure's short and slender ankles delicately upon the balls of her small feet. This would not be possible without the deliberate decision by Gould to distribute almost all of the marble's weight to her massive, flowing skirt. Unlike bronze sculpture, this statue is not hollow; her drapery is one solid block of marble.For a description of the greater flexibility of bronze sculptures and the ease with which action and extension may be expressed through bronze, see bronze sculpture. Note especially the sculpture Jet√©. Diana of Versailles statue in the Louvre: note use of skirt, tree stump, and stag for support of the body and lower arm and the \\"pinning\\" of the upper arm to the arrows in the quiver, forming several closed loops that are thus stronger Developing a sculpture A pitching tool for carving stone Sculptors usually begin by knocking off, or \\"pitching,\\" large portions of unwanted stone. A suitable tool for this task is a point chisel, which is a long, hefty piece of steel with a point at one end and a broad striking surface at the other. A pitching tool may also be used at this early stage, which is a wedge-shaped chisel with a broad, flat edge. The pitching tool is useful for splitting the stone and removing large, unwanted chunks. The sculptor may also use a mallet, which is similar to a hammer with a broad, barrel-shaped head. When the mallet connects to the tool, energy is transferred through the tool, shattering the stone. Most sculptors work rhythmically, turning the tool with each blow so that the stone is removed quickly and evenly. This is the \\"roughing out\\" stage of the sculpting process. While a mallet provides the force needed to fracture the marble, it must be used accurately. The smallest miscalculation can ruin the intended sculpture and even injure the sculptor. Some artists prefer to carve directly onto the stone, without a model; the Renaissance artist Michelangelo, for example, claimed that his job was to free the human form trapped inside the block. Other artists sculpt a preliminary model out of clay or wax and then translate its features to stone through the use of calipers or a pointing machine. Once the general shape of the statue has been determined, the sculptor uses other tools to refine the figure. A toothed chisel or claw chisel has multiple gouging surfaces which create parallel lines in the stone. These tools are generally used to add texture to the figure. An artist might mark out specific lines by using calipers to measure an area of stone to be addressed and marking the removal area with pencil, charcoal or chalk. The stone carver generally uses a shallower stroke at this point in the process. Eventually, the sculptor has changed the stone from a rough block into the general shape of the finished statue. Tools called rasps and rifflers are then used to enhance the shape into its final form. A rasp is a flat, steel tool with a coarse surface. The sculptor uses broad, sweeping strokes to remove excess stone as small chips or dust. A riffler is a smaller variation of the rasp, which can be used to create details such as folds of clothing or locks of hair. Polishing is the last step of the carving process. Sculptors use a variety of fine, abrasive materials such as sandpaper or emery paper to highlight patterns in the stone and to accentuate its natural sheen.Marble Sculpture (c.600 BCE - present), Encyclopedia of Sculpture Some sculptors may also use tin oxide to achieve a high-lustre polish. Regardless of the method, however, a glossy marble sculpture will appear more translucent than one that has not been polished. Tools The Italian terms for the basic carving tools of stone sculpture are given here, and where possible the English terms have been included. *La Mazza ‚Äì The mallet. This is used to strike the chisel. *Gli Scalpelli ‚Äì The chisels. These come in various types: **La Subbia ‚Äì (the Point) a pointed chisel or punch **L'Unghietto ‚Äì (Round or Rondel Chisel) Literally, \\"little fingernail\\" **La Gradina ‚Äì (Toothed Chisel or Claw) a chisel with multiple teeth- **Lo Scalpello ‚Äì a flat chisel *Lo Scapezzatore ‚Äì (Pitcher or Pitching Tool) a hefty chisel with a broad blunt edge, for splitting. *Il Martello Pneumatico ‚Äì Pneumatic hammer *Il Flessibile ‚Äì an angle grinder, fitted with an electrolysis-applied diamond studded blade *Hand Drill In addition to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor uses a variety of hammers ‚Äì both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and hand drills) and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, Bush Hammer in English). Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of rasps, files and abrasive rubbing stones and/or sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form. Tool technique Winged Victory of Samothrace, Hellenistic marble sculpture of the 3rd century BC Hammer and point work is the technique used in working stone, in use at least since Roman times, as it is described in the legend of Pygmalion, and even earlier, the ancient Greek sculptors used it from c. 650 BC. It consists of holding the pointed chisel against the stone and swinging the hammer at it as hard as possible. When the hammer connects with the striking end of the chisel, its energy is transferred down the length and concentrates on a single point on the surface of the block, breaking the stone. This is continued in a line following the desired contour. It may sound simple but many months are required to attain competency. A good stone worker can maintain a rhythm of relatively longer blows (about one per second), swinging the hammer in a wider arc, lifting the chisel between blows to flick out any chips that remain in the way, and repositioning it for the next blow. This way, one can drive the point deeper into the stone and remove more material at a time. Some stoneworkers also spin the subbia in their fingers between hammer blows, thus applying with each blow a different part of the point to the stone. This helps prevent the point from breaking.

It draws moisture through direct contact. In households, several types of fabric towels are used, including hand towels, bath towels and kitchen towels. At the beach, people use beach towels. Paper towels are provided in commercial or office bathrooms for users to dry their hands. In households they are used for minor, precision, or particularly dirty jobs of wiping, cleaning, and drying. History According to Middle Ages archaeological studies, \\"... closely held personal items included the ever present knife and a towel.\\"Hatcler, Margret. Family Ties that Bind, Middle Ages Family Life. Oxford University Press, 1968, p. 112. However, the invention of the towel is commonly associated with the city of Bursa, Turkey, in the 17th century. These Turkish towels began as a flat, woven piece of cotton or linen called a pestamel, often hand- embroidered. Long enough to wrap around the body, pestamel were originally fairly narrow, but are now wider and commonly measure . Pestamel were used in Turkish baths as they stayed light when wet and were very absorbent. As the Ottoman Empire grew, so did the use of the towel. Weavers were asked to embroider more elaborate designs, aided by their knowledge of carpet-weaving. By the 18th century, towels began to feature loops sticking up from the pile of the material. These looped towels became known as havly; over time, this word has changed to havlu, the Turkish word for towel, and means ‚Äòwith loops‚Äô. Towels did not become affordable until the 19th century, with the cotton trade and industrialization. With mechanization, cotton terry-towelling became available by the yard as well as being stocked in shops as pre-made towels. Today towels are available in a variety of sizes, materials and designs. Some hotels which provide towels and bath robes embed washable RFID tags into their linens to deter theft. Types A hand-made African towel Close-up photo of a bath towel, made of terrycloth, showing the absorbing fibres, along with a decorative pattern A beach towel Fibres in a tea towel Tunisian fouta towel * A bath towel is used for drying the body when it is wet, such as after bathing or showering. It is typically rectangular, with a typical size around , and is made of terry cloth. * A beach towel is usually a little bit larger than a bath towel. Although it is often used for drying off after being in the water, its chief purpose is to provide a surface on which to lie. They are also worn for privacy while changing clothes in a public area, and for wiping sand from the body or objects. Beach towels often have colorful patterns. * A sheet towel or bath sheet is larger than a bath towel. The classic bath sheet size is 80√ó160 cm. A large bath sheet that can wrap the entire body is 100√ó150 or 90√ó160 cm. They are used in baths, saunas, on beaches, and for massage; * A foot towel is a small, rectangular towel which, in the absence of a rug, carpet or bathroom mat, is placed on the bathroom floor to stand on after finishing a shower or bath. * A hand towel is significantly smaller than a bath towel (perhaps ), and is used for drying the hands after washing them. * An oven towel or confectioner's mitten is a multipurpose household towel used for a kitchen or shop applications. The term came into use within Irish communities after a textile mogul, Owen Valley, created the line based on his own towel experiences. * A paper towel is a piece of paper that can be used once as a towel and then be disposed of. A perforated roll of paper towels is normally mounted on a rod a little longer than the width of the roll, or in an alternative type of hanger that has protrusions on ears, the protrusions fitting into the ends of the paper towel roll. Paper towels can also be found packaged like facial tissues, as individual folded sheets. * A disposable towel (or non-woven towel) is a towel intended for a single user, but not necessarily for a single use, as it can be reused but not washed. It is often made of non-woven fibers, and popular for the hospital, hotel, geriatric and salon or beauty industries because it guarantees cleanliness and hygiene every time. * A show towel is a bath or hand towel that has had trim‚Äîsuch as satin, lace or linen stitched onto it, or embroidery done on it‚Äîmainly to simply \\"look nice\\". They are used to add a decorative touch‚Äîusually to a bathroom‚Äîmost commonly in the United States. They are generally not to be used to for drying, as regular washing ruins the added trim, and the towel buckles as well (because the towel usually shrinks differently than the trim). * A sports towel, or (synthetic) chamois, is a towel originally developed for swimmers and divers, favored for its super-absorbent qualities. Sports towels can be wrung out when saturated, leaving the towel able to absorb water again, although not dry. Those qualities, along with their compact nature, have further popularized sports towels amongst general outdoor and athletic enthusiasts. The absorbent material in sports towels may be composed of viscose, PVA or microfiber, with polyester woven in for durability. Some manufacturers incorporate a silver ion or compound treatment into their towels to better inhibit microbial growth and associated odors. * A sweat towel or gym towel, often of similar size to a hand towel, is used during a workout to dry oneself from sweat or make a barrier between the gym machines and the skin. It may also be required in gyms in order to wipe down the machines after use. * The term kitchen towel refers to a dish towel in American English (called a tea towel in UK and Canadian English) and to a paper towel in British English. *Tea towels or tea cloths (UK and Canadian English), called dishtowels or dish towels in America, originated in 18th-century England. They are absorbent towels made from soft, lint-free linen. They are used in the kitchen to dry dishes, cutlery, etc. after they are washed. The towels are also used during tea time. They can be wrapped around the tea pot to keep the tea warm, prevent drips, and keep one's hand from being burned by the hot tea pot handle when serving the tea. *A cloth towel dispenser or continuous cloth towel is a towel manipulated by a series of rollers, used as an alternative to paper towels and hand dryers in public washrooms. These may have a lower environmental impact than paper towels,Celsias Retrieved on 31 Oct 09 though concerns over hygiene mean they are not used by some organisations and have greatly declined in popularity. They can also be used in dangerous \\"choking games\\". * A bar towel is an absorbent, usually small towel used in bars and often given away free as promotional items. * A fingertip towel is a small towel that is folded and placed next to the sink or in the guest bedroom.

A screen adaptation of the play was released in 1996 by Channel 4 Films, with a revised screenplay also by Harvey. Plot of the Screen Version The story is set in Thamesmead, a working class area of South East London dominated by post-war council estates. Jamie, a teen who is infatuated with his classmate, Ste, has to deal with his single mother Sandra, who is pre- occupied with ambitious plans to run her own pub and with an ever-changing string of lovers, the latest of whom is Tony, a neo-hippie. Sandra finds herself at odds with Leah, a sassy and rude neighbour who has been expelled from school, does several drugs, and constantly listens and sings along to her mother's Cass Elliot records. While Jamie's homosexuality remains concealed, his introvert nature and dislike of football are reason enough for his classmates to bully him at every opportunity. Ste, who is living together with his drug-dealing brother and abusive, alcoholic father in the flat next door, is one night beaten by his father so badly that Sandra takes pity and lets him sleep over. In the absence of a third bed, Ste has to make do with sleeping 'top-to-toe' with Jamie. On the second night they share a bed: after a massage and a minor conversation, the boys soon change sleeping arrangements and Jamie kisses Ste for the first time. The next morning, Ste panics and leaves before Jamie awakens, avoiding him for days. Jamie works up the nerve to steal a Gay Times from a newsagent, apparently starting to accept his sexuality and affection for Ste. Jamie finally spots Ste at a nearby party and confronts him; they prepare to leave together. The party ends badly, with Sandra taking vengeance on Leah for gossiping, who then threatens to 'spill the beans' about Ste and Jamie and confesses to having covered up for Ste in front of his father and brother. Ste reacts poorly, angrily rejecting Jamie and running away. Slowly, Ste accepts Jamie's love and their relationship begins to develop as they visit a gay pub together. Sandra follows them and discovers their secret, and the story reaches its climax as a bad trip by Leah (on an unnamed drug) precipitates Sandra's breakup with Tony; the news of Sandra's new job comes out; and Sandra confronts Ste and Jamie. Sandra comes to accept her son's relationship. The play ends with the two boys slow-dancing in the courtyard of their council flats to the Cass Elliot song \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me\\", while a guarding Sandra dances defiantly at their side with Leah as the local residents look on; some of them shocked, some of them enjoying the moment themselves.

In Major League Baseball (MLB), he pitched 17 seasons on the Detroit Tigers and Cleveland Indians, from 1939 through 1955. Newhouser was an All-Star for six seasons, and was considered to be the most dominating pitcher of the World War II era of baseball, winning a pitcher's triple crown for the Tigers in 1945. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1992. After his retirement from baseball, Newhouser was away from the sport for 20 years, serving as a bank vice president. He later worked as a scout for several MLB teams, including the Houston Astros. Angered when they rebuffed his recommendation to draft future Hall of Famer Derek Jeter in favor of Phil Nevin, he quit shortly after. Early life Newhouser was a schoolboy star at Wilbur Wright High School in his hometown of Detroit, Michigan. Before he was approached by professional baseball teams, he had been saving money to attend a trade school by working several jobs. The young Newhouser sold newspapers, collected pop bottles and worked in a bowling alley before signing on in professional baseball. He was signed by the Detroit Tigers in at the age of 18. A Tigers scout offered a $500 signing bonus to Newhouser, who found the sum of money to be unimaginable. Ten minutes after he signed, someone arrived from the Cleveland Indians; that employee had been prepared to offer $15,000 to his parents in addition to a $4,000 car. Playing career=Early career= Newhouser made his debut for Detroit on September 29, 1939. In , he earned a spot on the Tigers out of spring training. In his first two full big-league seasons, the young left-hander experienced control problems, walking more batters than he struck out while posting win-loss records of 9‚Äì9 and 9‚Äì11. He improved in and , posting excellent earned run averages (ERAs), but he still lost more than he won on a team with a weak offense. As World War II got under way, the Tigers moved up in the standings because several of their top players, including Newhouser, were classified as 4-F (ineligible to be drafted). Newhouser was 4-F due to a leaky heart valve; he attempted to join the service anyway but was turned down several times. He blossomed in , becoming a dominant pitcher in wartime baseball. That season, Newhouser rang up a 29‚Äì9 record, leading the league in wins and strikeouts (187). His 2.22 ERA was second in the league, as were his 25 complete games and six shutouts. The Tigers jumped into contention, finishing second in the American League, with Newhouser named MVP. Newhouser won the first Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award in 1944.Pitcher of the Year By the season, Newhouser had been selected for three consecutive AL All-Star teams. The 1945 All-Star Game was cancelled on April 24 because of travel restrictions and seven out of eight scheduled interleague games were played in place of the All-Star Game on July 9 and 10 to support the American Red Cross and War Relief fund.Baseball Did You Know? ‚Äì VII, 1945 All Star Game Replacements Retrieved July 28, 2015Baseball Almanac Retrieved July 8, 2015 Newhouser became the first pitcher to repeat as MVP that season and helped the team win the World Series. He won the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the AL in wins (25, against nine losses), ERA (1.81) and strikeouts (212); he also led the league in innings pitched, games started, complete games and shutouts. Newhouser pitched four innings of relief on the season's final day as Detroit rallied for the pennant. Newhouser won the second Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award. He became the youngest player (24) to win the award in two consecutive years. In that year's World Series, Newhouser won two games, including a complete-game victory in the deciding seventh game. =Later career= In , he went 26‚Äì9 with a 1.94 ERA, again leading the league in wins and ERA. His 275 strikeouts was second in the league. Newhouser was runner-up in the MVP race to Ted Williams. Newhouser continued to rate among the game's best pitchers for the next five years. He won 17 games in , led the AL with 21 wins in and rang up an 18‚Äì11 mark in . After a 15‚Äì13 season in , he hurt his arm and his workload was cut significantly. After being released by the Tigers following the season, Newhouser signed on with the Cleveland Indians and was their top long reliever in , when Cleveland won 111 games and the pennant. In his final big-league hurrah, he posted a 7‚Äì2 mark with a 2.54 ERA, and got to pitch in his second World Series. He ended his career with a record of 207‚Äì150 and a 3.06 ERA. He is the only pitcher ever to win consecutive MVP awards. As a hitter, Newhouser had a .201 career batting average (201-for-999) with 70 runs, 2 home runs, 81 RBI and 89 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .971 fielding percentage covering 488 games pitched. Later life A statue of Newhouser in Comerica Park Newhouser spent his first 20 years after retiring from baseball away from the sport, working as a bank vice president in Pontiac, Michigan. Eventually, he served as a scout for the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers, and Houston Astros. As a scout with the Orioles, Newhouser discovered Milt Pappas, a Detroit high schooler who went on to win 209 games in an All-Star career ‚Äî two more than Newhouser did. He also signed future Cy Young Award winner Dean Chance, who later earned the trophy with the Los Angeles Angels in 1964. While with the Astros, Newhouser was credited with discovering Derek Jeter, whom the Astros passed over for Phil Nevin. He quit his job with the Astros after they ignored his advice to draft Jeter, though he had planned to retire after that season in any case. In , he was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His induction class included Tom Seaver, Rollie Fingers and Bill McGowan. The ceremony was attended by a then-record-setting crowd of 20,000 people. The Tigers retired Newhouser's number 16 in . He died on November 10, 1998 in a hospital in Southfield, Michigan. He had been ill with emphysema and heart problems. Personal life During his playing days, Newhouser's teammates nicknamed him \\"Prince Hal\\" because of the way he carried himself. His wife, Beryl Newhouser, said that she could not ever remember seeing him with his shirttail untucked.

It is an original story by screenwriter Paul Rudnick. Joan Cusack was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The film was inspired by Tom Hanks's tearful speech when he accepted his 1994 Oscar (for his role in Philadelphia), in which he mentioned his high-school drama coach Rawley Farnsworth, and his former classmate John Gilkerson, \\"two of the finest gay Americans, two wonderful men that I had the good fortune to be associated with.\\" The film became one of mainstream Hollywood's few attempts at a comedic \\"gay movie\\" of its era, and was widely noted at the time for a 12-second kiss between Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck. Plot Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is a well-liked English literature teacher, living a quiet life in the fictional town of Greenleaf, Indiana, with his fianc√©e and fellow teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), who recently lost 75 pounds. The town is filled with anticipation over the nomination of Howard's former student Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) in the Best Actor category at the Academy Awards for his portrayal of a gay soldier in To Serve and Protect. Cameron does indeed win the award and, in his acceptance speech, thanks Howard, adding, \\". . . and he's gay.\\" Howard's family, friends, students, co-workers and Emily are shocked; but that is nothing compared to Howard's own reaction of disbelief and indignation. He angrily reassures those who know him that he is heterosexual. Reporters invade his hometown, harassing him for interviews, following the awards night telecast. Howard is placed under the scrutiny of his boss, Principal Tom Halliwell (Bob Newhart), who is uncomfortable with the attention being brought to the school. Although the other reporters leave after getting their story, one stays behind: on-camera entertainment reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck), who wants to wait the week out so he can cover Howard's wedding to Emily. Howard continues to be harassed and dismayed by the changed attitudes of everyone around him, and decides that he must sleep with Emily in order to prove his heterosexuality. Howard finds he cannot go through with it due to his conflicting emotions and Emily's concern for his well- being. Howard crosses paths with Peter, who reveals he is gay and, trying to provide a helpful ear, narrates his own experience in coming out to his family. Howard insists that he is not gay, prompting Peter to kiss him. Although shocked, Howard reacts somewhat positively to the kiss. Howard's final measure to restore his heterosexuality is the use of a self-help audio cassette, although that fails as well. During the wedding ceremony, Emily recites her vow without hesitation, but when Howard is prompted by the minister, he instead says, \\"I'm gay.\\" The wedding is called off, and although Peter is proud of Howard, Howard is angry with himself for hurting Emily. Howard is fired from the school because of his outing. Despite no longer being on the faculty, Howard attends the graduation ceremony to support his students. Having learned of the ensuing media blitz while in Los Angeles, Cameron flies to his hometown with his supermodel girlfriend (Shalom Harlow) and shows up at the ceremony. When he learns that his former teacher became ineligible for the \\"Teacher of the Year\\" award due to being dismissed for being gay, he publicly questions if the reason given, that the community would not have supported Howard's continued employment, is valid. Spurred on by this, when one student who got into college‚Äîthanks to Howard's hard work‚Äîproclaims to be gay, his classmates join him to proclaim themselves to be gay as well, showing their support. Howard's family follows suit, as do his friends, and all the townsfolk assembled. Although Howard does not win \\"Teacher of the Year\\", Cameron presents him with his Oscar. Howard's wedding- crazy mother (Debbie Reynolds) finally gets a wedding‚Äîher own, when she and her husband (Wilford Brimley) renew their vows. Howard, Peter and the rest of the townsfolk attend the reception. Among the crowd are Emily and Cameron, who appear to have begun a relationship. Everyone dances to the Village People's song \\"Macho Man\\".

Set in the fantasy land of Hyrule, the plot centers on an elf-like boy named Link, who aims to collect the eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom in order to rescue Princess Zelda from the antagonist, Ganon. During the course of the game, the player controls Link from a top-down perspective and navigates throughout the overworld and dungeons, collecting weapons, defeating enemies and uncovering secrets along the way. The first game of The Legend of Zelda series, it was originally released in Japan as a launch game for the Family Computer Disk System peripheral in February 1986. More than a year later, North America and Europe received releases on the Nintendo Entertainment System in cartridge format, being the first home console game to include an internal battery for saving data. This version was later released in Japan in 1994 under the title The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda 1. The game was ported to the GameCube and Game Boy Advance, and is available via the Virtual Console on the Wii, Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. It was also one of 30 games included in the NES Classic Edition system, and is available on the Nintendo Switch through the NES Switch Online service. The Legend of Zelda was a critical and commercial success for Nintendo. The game sold over 6.5 million copies, launched a major franchise, and has been regularly featured in lists of the greatest video games of all time. A sequel, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, was first released in Japan for the Famicom Disk System less than a year after its predecessor, and numerous additional successors and spinoffs have been released in the decades since its debut. Gameplay Link attacking Octorok monsters with his sword in the overworld The Legend of Zelda incorporates elements of action, adventure, and role-playing genres. The player controls Link from a flip-screen overhead perspective as he travels the overworld, a large outdoor map with various environments. While the player begins the game armed only with a small shield, a tantalizing cave immediately beckons them within, where a sword is entrusted to Link by an old man for use as their primary weapon with the auspicious first message, ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS DANGEROUS TO GO ALONE! TAKE THIS‚Äù. Throughout the adventure, Link will find or acquire various items that increase his abilities further; from Heart Containers that increase his life meter, to magic rings that decrease the amount of damage Link takes from enemy attacks, to stronger swords that let Link do more damage to enemies. These items are mainly found in caves scattered throughout the land. Some are easily accessible, while others are hidden beneath obstacles such as rocks, trees, and waterfalls. Deadly creatures roaming about everywhere drop Rupees, the game's currency, when defeated and Rupees can also be found in hidden treasure chests all over the game world. Rupees are used to buy equipment from shops such as bombs and arrows. Hidden on the overworld are entrances to the large underworld dungeons housing the pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom; Each a unique, maze-like layout of rooms connected by doors and secret passages, often barred by monsters which must be defeated or blocks moved to gain entrance. Dungeons also contain useful items which Link can add to his inventory, such as a boomerang for stunning enemies and retrieving distant items, and a magical recorder that let's Link teleport to the entrance of any dungeon he has previously cleared. By successfully completing each dungeon to obtain all eight pieces of the Triforce of Wisdom, the artifact allows entrance to the final dungeon to defeat Ganon and rescue Zelda. Apart from this exception, the order in which the game may be completed by traversing any given dungeon on the overworld is largely flexible to players, although they do steadily increase in difficulty by number, and some rooms can only be passed by using items gained in previous locations. There are even dungeons with secret entrances which must be uncovered while freely wandering the overworld, after acquiring useful items. This great freedom of where to go and what to do at any point allows for many ways of progressing through the game. It is even possible to reach the final boss without receiving the normally vital sword at its outset. After initially completing the game, one can begin its more difficult version referred to as the , which alters many locations, secrets, and includes entirely distinct dungeons, with stronger enemies as well.ZELDA: The Second Quest Begins (1988), p. 28 Although more difficult \\"replays\\" were not unique to Zelda, few games offered completely different levels upon the second playthrough. By starting a new file with the name entered as \\"ZELDA\\", this mode can instead be accessed without needing to beat the game first. Synopsis=Setting= Within the official Zelda Chronology, The Legend of Zelda takes place in an Era called \\"The Era of Decline\\", which exists within an alternative reality. In this era, Hyrule has been reduced to a small kingdom where the residents now live in caves, setting the background for The Legend of Zelda. =Story= The story of The Legend of Zelda is described in the instruction booklet and during the short prologue which plays after the title screen: A small kingdom in the land of Hyrule is engulfed by chaos when an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded and stole the Triforce of Power, one part of a magical artifact which alone bestows great strength. In an attempt to prevent him from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the three pieces, Princess Zelda splits it into eight fragments and hides them in secret underground dungeons. Before eventually being kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous enough to save the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, when a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. Upon hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, with which Ganon can then be defeated. During the course of the tale, Link locates and braves the eight underworld labyrinths, and beyond their defeated guardian monsters retrieves each fragment. With the completed Triforce of Wisdom, he is able to infiltrate Ganon's hideout in Death Mountain, confronting the prince of darkness and destroying him with the Silver Arrow. Obtaining the Triforce of Power from Ganon's ashes, Link returns it and the restored Triforce of Wisdom to the rescued Princess Zelda, and peace can return to Hyrule. History=Development and Japanese release= The game was first released in Japan as a disk for the Famicom Disk System. It was later converted to a cartridge for American release on the NES. The Legend of Zelda was directed and designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka (credited as S. Miyahon and Ten Ten respectively in the closing credits). Miyamoto produced the game, and Tezuka wrote the story and script. Keiji Terui, a screenwriter who worked on anime shows such as Dr. Slump and Dragon Ball, wrote the backstory for the manual, drawing inspiration from conflicts in medieval Europe. Development began in 1984, and the game was originally intended to be a launch game for the Famicom Disk System.Legend of Zelda Developer Interview with Shigeru Miyamoto, Legend of Zelda: Sound and Drama, 1994 The development team worked on The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Bros. concurrently, and tried to separate their ideas: Super Mario Bros. was to be linear, where the action occurred in a strict sequence, whereas The Legend of Zelda would be the opposite. In Mario, Miyamoto downplayed the importance of the high score in favor of simply completing the game. This concept was carried over to The Legend of Zelda. Miyamoto was also in charge of deciding which concepts were \\"Zelda ideas\\" or \\"Mario ideas.\\" Contrasting with Mario, Zelda was made non-linear and forced the players to think about what they should do next. According to Miyamoto, those in Japan were confused and had trouble finding their way through the multi-path dungeons, and in initial game designs, the player would start with the sword already in their inventory. Rather than merely simplifying matters for players, Miyamoto forced the player to listen to the old man who gives the player their sword, and encouraged interaction among people to share their ideas with each other to find the various hidden secrets, a new form of gaming communication. Relatedly, this concept turned into the root of another series to be developed many years in the future: \\"Zelda became the inspiration for something very different: Animal Crossing. This was a game based solely on communication.\\" With The Legend of Zelda, Miyamoto wanted to flesh out the idea of a game \\"world\\" even further, giving players a \\"miniature garden that they can put inside their drawer.\\" He drew his inspiration from his experiences as a boy around Kyoto, where he explored nearby fields, woods, and caves, always trying through Zelda games to impart players some sense of that limitless wonder he felt through unknown exploration. \\"When I was a child,\\" he said, \\"I went hiking and found a lake. It was quite a surprise for me to stumble upon it. When I traveled around the country without a map, trying to find my way, stumbling on amazing things as I went, I realized how it felt to go on an adventure like this.\\"Sheff (1993), p. 51 The memory of being lost amid the maze of sliding doors in his family's home in Sonobe was recreated in Zeldas labyrinthian dungeons.Sheff (1993), p. 52 The hero ‚ÄúLink‚Äù was so named in part to connect players inserted into this world with their interactive role, as something of a blank slate represent and not their individuality or methods. Designed by Miyamoto as a coming of age motif to identify with, journeying as an ordinary boy strengthened by trials to triumph over great challenges and rise to meet evil. The name of the titular princess came from Zelda Fitzgerald. Miyamoto explained, ‚ÄúZelda was the wife of famous novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a famous and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked the sound of her name. So I took the liberty of using [it] for the very first title.‚Äù Early Zelda concepts involved technological elements, with microchips for the Triforce made of electronic circuits and a time-travelling protagonist, another factor of their name relating to the idea of a computer hyper-‚Äùlink‚Äù. While the final game follows a more traditional heroic fantasy setting, subsequent games in the series have incorporated some technology based concepts. Koji Kondo (credited as Konchan) composed the game's five music tracks. He had planned to use Maurice Ravel's Bol√©ro as the title theme, but was forced to change it late in the development cycle after learning that the copyright for the orchestral piece had not yet expired. As a result, Kondo wrote a new arrangement of the overworld theme within one day, which has become an iconic motif echoing throughout continued entries of the series. In February 1986, Nintendo released The Legend of Zelda as the launch game for the Family Computer's new Disk System peripheral, joined by a re-release of Super Mario Bros., Tennis, Baseball, Golf, Soccer, and Mahjong as part of the system‚Äôs introduction. It made full use of Disk Card media's advantages over traditional ROM cartridges, with an increased size of 128 kilobytes which would be expensive to produce on cartridge format. Due to the still-limited amount of disk space, all of the text used in game was from only a single syllabary known as katakana, which under normal circumstances primarily relates more to foreign words which supplement those of traditional Japanese origin as with hiragana and kanji characters. Rather than passwords, rewritable disks saved players‚Äô game progress, and the extra sound channel provided by the system was utilized for certain sound effects; most notably Link's sword beam at full health, roars and growls of dungeon bosses, and those of defeated enemies. Sound effects had to be altered for the eventual cartridge release version of Zelda which used the Famicom's PCM channel. The game also took advantage of that system‚Äôs controller having a built-in microphone, a feature the NES model did not include. It was used to defeat the large-eared rabbit-like monster Pols Voice by blowing or shouting. The U.S. instruction manual still hints that this enemy \\"hates loud noise\\", confusing many into thinking the recorder item could be used to attack. (In actuality, it has no effect.) The cartridge version made use of the Memory Management Controller chip (specifically the MMC1 model), which could use bank-switching to allow for larger games than had previously been possible, and could also use battery-powered RAM letting players save their data for the first time on any cartridge-based medium. =American release= The gold-colored cartridge When Nintendo published the game in North America, the packaging design featured a small portion of the box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies.Sheff (1993), p. 172 Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card became a member of the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.Sheff (1987), p. 178 From the success of magazines in Japan, Nintendo knew that game tips were a valued asset. Players enjoyed the bimonthly newsletter's crossword puzzles and jokes, but game secrets were most valued. The Fun Club drew kids in by offering tips for the more complicated games, especially Zelda, with its hidden rooms, secret keys and passageways. The mailing list grew. By early 1988, there were over 1 million Fun Club members, which led then-Nintendo of America president Minoru Arakawa to start the Nintendo Power magazine.Sheff (1993), p. 178 Since Nintendo did not have many products, it made only a few commercials a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily four or five times more than most companies spent.Sheff (1993), p. 188 One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received a great deal of attention in the ad industry. In it, a wiry-haired, nerdy guy (John Kassir) walks through the dark making goofy noises, yelling out the names of some enemies from the game, and screaming for Zelda. Reception The Legend of Zelda received highly positive reviews from critics and was a bestseller for Nintendo, selling over 6.5 million copies; it was the first NES game to sell over 1 million. It was reissued in 1992 as part of Nintendo's \\"Classic Series\\" and featured a grey cartridge. The game placed first in the player's poll \\"Top 30\\" in Nintendo Powers first issue and continued to dominate the list into the early 1990s. The Legend of Zelda was also voted by Nintendo Power readers as the \\"Best Challenge\\" in the Nintendo Power Awards '88. The magazine also listed it as the best Nintendo Entertainment System video game ever created, stating that it was fun despite its age and it showed them new ways to do things in the genre such as hidden dungeons and its various weapons. GamesRadar ranked it the third best NES game ever made. The staff praised its \\"mix of complexity, open world design, and timeless graphics\\". Critics lauded the graphics, Kondo‚Äôs score, and writing. Another praised aspect is its gameplay, which they hailed as groundbreaking. Computer Gaming World in 1988 named the game as the best adventure of the year for Nintendo, stating that Zelda had been a \\"sensational success\\" in translating a computer RPG to consoles. In 1990 the magazine stated that the game was a killer app, causing computer CRPG players who had dismissed consoles as \\"mere arcade toys\\" to buy the NES. Zelda was reviewed in 1992 by Total! #2 where it received a 78% rating due in great part to mediocre subscores for music and graphics.Jarratt, Steve. The Legend of Zelda. Total!. Issue 2. Pg.20-21. February 1992. A 1993 review of the game was printed in Dragon #198 by Sandy Petersen in the \\"Eye of the Monitor\\" column. Petersen gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The Legend of Zelda has received critical acclaim from modern critics and remains well regarded. It is often featured in lists of games considered the greatest or most influential. It placed first in Game Informers list of the \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\" and \\"The Top 200 Games of All Time\\" (in 2001 and 2009 respectively), thirteenth in Electronic Gaming Monthlys 100th issue listing the \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\", Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article (on page 100) explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. fifth in Electronic Gaming Monthlys 200th issue listing \\"The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time\\", seventh in Nintendo Powers list of the 200 Best Nintendo Games Ever, 77th in Official Nintendo Magazine's 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time and 80th among IGN readers' \\"Top 99 Games\\". Zelda was inducted into GameSpy's Hall of Fame in August 2000 and voted by GameSpy's editors as the tenth best game of all time. Editors of the popular Japanese magazine Weekly Famitsu voted the game among the best on the Famicom. In 1997 Next Generation listed the North American release in their \\"Five Greatest Game Packages of All Time\\", citing the die-cut hole which revealed the gold cartridge, full color manual, and fold-out map. Impact and legacy The Legend of Zelda is considered a spiritual forerunner of the modern role-playing video game (RPG) genre. Though it is often not considered part of the genre since it lacked key RPG mechanics such as experience points, it had many features in common with RPGs and served as the template for the action role-playing game genre. The game's fantasy setting, musical style and action-adventure gameplay were adopted by many RPGs. Its commercial success helped lay the groundwork for involved, non-linear games in fantasy settings, such as those found in successful RPGs, including Crystalis, Soul Blazer, Square's Seiken Densetsu series, Alundra, and Brave Fencer Musashi. The popularity of the game also spawned several clones trying to emulate the game.An example is a clone for the TRS-80 Color Computer III called \\"The Quest for Thelda\\", written by Eric A. Wolf and licensed to Sundog Systems. The Legend of Zelda spawned a solitary sequel, many prequels and spin-offs and is one of Nintendo's most popular series. It established important characters and environments of the Zelda universe, including Link, Princess Zelda, Ganon, Impa, and the Triforce as the power that binds Hyrule together. The overworld theme and distinctive \\"secret found\\" jingle have appeared in nearly every subsequent Zelda game. The theme has also appeared in various other games featuring references to the Zelda series. An arcade system board, called the Triforce, was developed jointly by Namco, Sega, and Nintendo, with the first games appearing in 2002. The name \\"Triforce\\" is a reference to Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda series of games, and symbolized the three companies' involvement in the project. GameSpot featured The Legend of Zelda as one of the 15 most influential games of all time, for being an early example of open world, nonlinear gameplay, and for its introduction of battery backup saving, laying the foundations for later action-adventure games like Metroid and role- playing video games like Final Fantasy, while influencing most modern games in general. In 2009, Game Informer called The Legend of Zelda \\"no less than the greatest game of all time\\" on their list of \\"The Top 200 Games of All Time\\", saying that it was \\"ahead of its time by years if not decades\\". In 2011, Nintendo celebrated the game's 25th anniversary in a similar vein to the Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary celebration the previous year. This celebration included a free mailout Club Nintendo offer of the Ocarina of Time soundtrack to owners of the 3DS version of that particular game, the first digital for Nintendo eShop release of Link's Awakening DX, special posters that are mailed out as rewards through Club Nintendo, and a special stage inspired by the original Legend of Zelda in the video game Super Mario 3D Land for the Nintendo 3DS. =Re-releases= The Legend of Zelda was first re-released in cartridge format for the Famicom in 1994. The cartridge version slightly modified the title screen of the Disk Card version of the game, such that it displayed the number 1 at the end of the title. In 2001, the original game was re-released in the GameCube game Animal Crossing. The only way to unlock the game is by using an Action Replay. An official re-release was included in 2003's The Legend of Zelda: Collector's Edition for the GameCube, and the game was again re-released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 along with its sequel, The Adventure of Link, as part of the Famicom Mini/Classic NES Series. In 2006, it was released on the Wii's Virtual Console, and a timed demo of the game was released for the 2008 Wii game Super Smash Bros. Brawl, available in the Vault section. All re-releases of the game are virtually identical to the original, though the GameCube, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console versions have been altered slightly to correct several instances of incorrect spelling from the original, most notably in the intro story. A tech demo called Classic Games was shown for the Nintendo 3DS at E3 2010, showcasing more than a dozen classic games using 3D effects, including The Legend of Zelda. It was announced by Reggie Fils-Aim√©, president of Nintendo of America, that the games were slated for release on the 3DS, including The Legend of Zelda, Mega Man 2, and Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island and would possibly make use of some of the 3DS's features, such as 3D effects, analog control, or camera support. The Legend of Zelda was released to the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console on September 1, 2011 as a part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador program, and was later released to the Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2011 in Japan, April 12, 2012 in Europe and July 5, 2012 in North America. The version released to the Japanese 3DS Virtual Console was the cartridge version. The game was released for the Nintendo Switch as part of the Nintendo Switch Online - Nintendo Entertainment System service on September 18, 2018. A special \\"Living the life of luxury!\\" edition of the game, which grants players all equipment and extra items at the start of the game, was added to the service on October 10, 2018. =Sequels= There have also been a few substantially altered versions of the game that have been released as pseudo-sequels, and ura- or gaiden-versions.

From August 6, 1995, to September 2, 1995, Nintendo, in collaboration with the St.GIGA satellite radio network, began broadcasts of a substantially different version of the original The Hyrule Fantasy: Legend of Zelda for a Super Famicom peripheral, the Satellaview‚Äîa satellite modem add-on. The game, , was released for download in four episodic, weekly installments which were rebroadcast at least four times between the game's 1995 premier and January 1997. BS Zelda was the first Satellaview game to feature a \\"SoundLink\\" soundtrack‚Äîa streaming audio track through which, every few minutes, players were cautioned to listen carefully as a voice actor narrator, broadcasting live from the St.GIGA studio, would give them plot and gameplay clues. In addition to the SoundLink elements, BS Zelda also featured updated 16-bit graphics, a smaller overworld, and different dungeons. Link was replaced by one of the two Satellaview avatars: a boy wearing a backward baseball cap or a girl with red hair. Between December 30, 1995, and January 6, 1996, a second version of the game, , was broadcast to the Satellaview as the functional equivalent of the original The Legend of Zeldas Second Quest. MAP 2 was rebroadcast only once, in March 1996.

The Guisborough ward of Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council had a population of 7,662 at the 2011 census. The civil parish of Guisborough, including the outlying villages of Upleatham, Dunsdale and Newton under Roseberry, had a population of 17,777. History Guisborough, once in the North Riding of Yorkshire, was part of the County of Cleveland from 1974 to 1996, and is now in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland. Guisborough Priory Some archaeologists date the town to the Roman occupation, when it may have been a military fortification. Discovery of a few Roman artefacts support this, such as the elaborate ceremonial Guisborough Helmet (see below), but proof is still lacking. Gighesbore is recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as a place within Langbaurgh Wapentake.Open Domesday: Guisborough, accessed 15 February 2020. The ruined Gisborough Priory dates from the 12th century.The priory, Gisborough Hall (16th century, demolished and rebuilt) and some other features are spelt without the first \\"u\\". Guisborough market, held every Thursday and Saturday with a few stalls on Tuesday, has long been a focal point for the surrounding area. Originally selling cattle and other livestock, the market developed into a general market for fruit and vegetables, clothing and flowers. It is open from early morning to late afternoon on the recently restored cobbles of Westgate, the principal shopping street. Guisborough Museum, behind Westgate's Sunnyfield House, exhibits photos of Guisborough's history and inhabitants. There is a working watermill at Tocketts Mill. Extensive residential development occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, connected with the expansion of the chemical industry at Wilton and the steel industry at Redcar. =The Guisborough Helmet= Guisborough Helmet The Guisborough Helmet is a Roman cavalry helmet found near the town in 1864. It was originally fitted with protective cheek-pieces, which have not survived, but the attachment holes can be seen in front of the helmet's ear guards. It is lavishly decorated with engraved and embossed figures, indicating that it was probably used for display or cavalry tournaments, although possibly for battle as well. It was unearthed in what appears to be a carefully arranged deposition in a bed of gravel, distant from any known Roman sites. After its recovery during roadworks, it was donated to the British Museum for restoration and display. =St Nicholas Church= The Church of St Nicholas The Anglican Church of St Nicholas holds the De Brus Cenotaph. A church may have existed here in 1290. The chancel of the present one dates from the late 15th century and the nave and interior have been altered. The church in its present form resulted from major rebuilding in 1903‚Äì1908, to a design by Temple Moore. =Gisborough Hall= Gisborough Hall, a Victorian mansion, was built in the Jacobean style in 1856. Once the home of the family of Lord Gisborough, the estate was then owned by the Chaloner family from just after the dissolution of Gisborough Priory. Gisborough Hall is a Grade II listed building, now converted into a hotel. =Guisborough Town Hall= Guisborough's prominent Town Hall (Grade II listed) was built on Westgate in 1821. Its initial two storeys were topped with a third in 1870. The ground floor served as a \\"shambles\\" or meat-market, with rooms above, some used from the building's earliest days as solicitors' offices (Lewis 1831, 286 and Baines 1823, 3). The ground floor also contained a cell or vault (Harrison and Dixon 1981, 131). The town hall was last occupied by two firms of solicitors, which vacated it in 2014. Its proprietor, a limited company, entered receivership and the building was bought by Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council due to concern for its future. A community group has been formed to keep the building in use while maintaining its historic integrity. =Industrialisation= The town shared in the prosperity of the Industrial Revolution through its proximity to the ironstone mines of the North York Moors. One of Teesside's leading ironfounders, Sir Joseph Whitwell Pease, chose as his country seat the Alfred Waterhouse-designed Gothic revival Hutton Hall at Hutton Lowcross, near Guisborough. It had its own station on the Middlesbrough‚ÄìGuisborough branch of the North Eastern Railway, but this closed in 1964. Groups and societies Guisborough is the home of the Orion Explorer Scout Unit for young people aged 14‚Äì18, affiliated to the Scout Association. Activities include work within The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, Young Leaders volunteering, and over 200 different adventure activities. It has about 30 members from the district. The Third Scout Group on Belmangate was established in 1974.[scouts.org.uk] Guisborough is also home to a group of volunteer trail builders, who aim to provide free mountain bike trails in the local forest. Local musicians are catered for at an open mic/jam session held every Wednesday night. Education The Waterhouse Building, Prior Pursglove College Primary education is provided at Belmont, Galley Hill, Highcliffe, St Paulinus (Roman Catholic), and Chaloner Primary, an amalgamation of the earlier Northgate Junior and Park Lane schools. Laurence Jackson School, at the eastern end of the town, is the only secondary school, and doubles as a Specialist Sports College. It marked its 50th anniversary in 2008. Prior Pursglove College is a sixth form college teaching GCSE, A level and AS level students. It stands next to the parish church and the priory ruins on the former site of Guisborough Grammar School, which it replaced due to restructuring of the education system. The grammar school was founded in 1561 by Robert Pursglove, the last Prior of Gisborough, as a charitable school for poor boys. It was accompanied by a set of almshouses for twelve pensioners. Askham Bryan College of Agriculture has opened a Guisborough Centre on the same site as Prior Pursglove College. It consists of an animal management centre and a modern building, the Priory Centre, which the two colleges share. Access Highcliff Nab Two main roads cross at Guisborough, the A171 and the A173. The A171 leads west to Middlesbrough and east to Whitby, the A173 south- west to Stokesley and north-east as far as Skelton, where it joins the A174 coast road. Before the bypass was built, the A171 ran along Westgate, the town's main street, crossing the A173 at Chapel Beck Bridge. Just outside the bypass to the north-east, a B-road heads north from the A173 to Redcar. Another minor route out of the town, Wilton Lane, is a winding, almost single- track road northwards to the village of Wilton and on to the ICI Wilton chemical works. There are two other lanes that lead out of town into the hills. Hutton Lane ends at Hutton Village, a tiny settlement built mostly for local mining, agricultural and estate workers. Belmangate is an ancient funeral route. Arriva X56 Bus to Middlesbrough Until 1964, Guisborough was served by trains from Middlesbrough ‚Äì the Middlesbrough & Guisborough Railway had its terminus at the now-demolished Guisborough station. Before 1958 it had been possible to travel from Guisborough to Whitby and Scarborough, along the scenic North Yorkshire coast railway. The south of the town is bounded by the North York Moors National Park. Guisborough Forest, which is Forestry Commission land, clothes the edge of the moors. Through the forest, the ground rises sharply, climbing from the plain below to the moors behind. There are several rocky outcrops on the steep slope, including Highcliff Nab and the Hanging Stone. The woods are crossed by several rights of way, including Cleveland Way, but other paths and commission tracks are also open to walkers. Beyond the woods, the ground levels out to form Gisborough Moor. Economy Formerly, one main employer in the town was The Shirt Factory; towards the end of its existence this was acquired by Montague Burton of Leeds, but it closed in 1999. Other major local employers now gone were Blackett Hutton and Co., maker of medium high-integrity castings, and the civil engineering firm Henderson Campbell. Guisborough is a commuter town for nearby Middlesbrough, with many working in the chemical plants around Teesside. On 15 January 2004, Guisborough was granted Fairtrade Town status. Sports and recreation Guisborough's King George's Field, named in memory of King George V, hosts the town's football team, Guisborough Town FC. The area adjacent to its playing field has a small playground and a skate park. There is a swimming pool dating from 1968 located within the grounds. An eight-year campaign led by the late MP Dr Ashok Kumar secured extensive refurbishment of the pool, which was completed in 2008‚Äì2009. The Rugby Union Football club plays in North One East division of the Northern Section of the RFU leagues, after promotion from the Durham/Northumberland leagues in the 2014‚Äì2015 season. Guisborough Cricket Club plays in the North Yorkshire South Durham Premier league, and in 2001‚Äì2004 equalled its record of four successive league wins. Among the past players have been the professionals Murray Goodwin (Sussex and Zimbabwe), Desmond Haynes and Phil Simmons (both West Indies), Imran Jan (Trinidad and Tobago), Sean Clingeleffer (Tasmania) and Greg Todd (Otago).

(), also known as a chadareeAlso transliterated chadri or chadari. () in Afghanistan or a paranja (; ) in Central Asia, is an enveloping outer garment which covers the body and the face that is worn by women in some Islamic traditions. The Arab version of the burqa is called the boshiya, and is usually black in color. The term burqa is sometimes conflated with niqƒÅb. In more precise usage, niqab is a face veil that leaves the eyes uncovered, while a burqa covers the entire body from the top of the head to the ground, with only a mesh screen allowing the wearer to see in front of her. The burqa is also not to be confused with the hijab, a garment which covers the hair, neck and all or part of the chest, but not the face. The burqa and other types of face veils have been attested since pre-Islamic times. Face veiling has not been regarded as a religious requirement by most Islamic scholars, past or present. However, some scholars, especially those belonging to the Salafi movement, view it as obligatory for women in the presence of non-related (mahram) males. Women may wear the burqa for a number of reasons, including compulsion, as was the case in Afghanistan during Taliban rule. There are currently 15 nations that have banned the burqa, including Austria, Denmark, France, Belgium, Tajikistan, Latvia, Bulgaria, Smh.com.au: accessed 5 December 2016. Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Uzbekistan the Netherlands, and China. Pre-Islamic use of the face veil Temple of Baal, Palmyra, Syria, 1st century CE. The face veil was originally part of women's dress among certain classes in the Byzantine Empire and was adopted into Muslim culture during the Arab conquest of the Middle East.See for instance F. R. C. Bagley, \\"Introduction\\", in B. Spuler, A History of the Muslim World. The Age of the Caliphs, 1995, X; for a different view T. Dawson, \\"Propriety, practicality and pleasure : the parameters of women's dress in Byzantium, A.D. 1000-1200\\", in L. Garland (ed.), Byzantine women: varieties of experience 800-1200, 2006, 41-76. However, although Byzantine art before Islam commonly depicts women with veiled heads or covered hair, it does not depict women with veiled faces. In addition, the Greek geographer Strabo, writing in the first century AD, refers to some Median women veiling their faces;Geography 11.13.9-10.:\\"Some say that Medeia introduced this kind of dress when she, along with Jason, held dominion in this region, even concealing her face whenever she went out in public in place of the king \\" and the early third-century Christian writer Tertullian clearly refers in his treatise The Veiling of Virgins to some \\"pagan\\" women of \\"Arabia\\" wearing a veil that covers not only their head but also the entire face.The Veiling of Virgins Ch. 17. Tertullian writes, \\"The pagan women of Arabia, who not only cover their head but their whole face, so that they would rather enjoy half the light with one eye free than prostitute the face, will judge you. (Judicabunt vos Arabiae feminae ethnicae quae non- caput, sed faciem totam tegunt, ut uno oculo liberato contentae sint dimidiam frui lucem quam totam faciem prostituere).\\" Clement of Alexandria commends the contemporary use of face coverings. There are also two Biblical references to the employment of covering face veils in Genesis 38.14 and Genesis 24.65, by Tamar and by Rebeccah, Judah and Abraham's daughters-in-law respectively. These primary sources show that some women in Egypt, Arabia, Canaan and Persia veiled their faces long before Islam. In the case of Tamar, the Biblical text, 'When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot; because she had covered her face' indicates customary, if not sacral, use of the face veil to accentuate rather than disguise sexuality. The Afghan chadaree style of burqa has been worn by Pashtun women since pre-Islamic times and was historically seen as a mark of respectability. Face veiling in Islam Most Islamic scholars and most contemporary Islamic jurists have agreed that women are not required to cover their face. = Scriptural sources = Although the Quran commands both men and women to behave modestly and contains no precise prescription for how women should dress, certain Quranic verses have been used in exegetical discussions of face veiling. Coming after a verse which instructs men to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, verse 24:31 instructs women to do the same, providing additional detail: The verse goes on to list a number of other types of exempted males. Classical Quranic commentators differed in their interpretation of the phrase \\"except what is apparent outwardly\\". Some argued that it referred to face and hands, implying that these body parts need not be covered, while others disagreed. Another passage, known as the \\"mantle verse\\" (33:59), has been interpreted as establishing women's security as a rationale for veiling: Based on the context of the verse and early Islamic literature, this verse has been generally understood as establishing a way to protect the Muslim women from a hostile faction who had molested them on the streets of Medina, claiming that they confused them with slave girls. The exact nature of garments referred to in these verses, khimar and jilbab, has been debated by traditional and modern scholars. Islamic scholars who hold that face veiling is not obligatory also base this on a narration from one of the canonical hadith collections (sayings attributed to Muhammad), in which he tells Asma', the daughter of Abu Bakr: \\"O Asma ø, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this\\", pointing to her face and hands (Ab≈´ Daw≈´d, Book 32, Number 4092). According to Yusuf al-Qaradawi, traditional hadith scholars have not viewed this narration as providing proof on its own, because its recorded chain of transmission made them uncertain about its authenticity, but those who argued that face veiling is not required have used it as supporting evidence strengthened by other textual sources, such as those recording customary practice at the time of Muhammad and his companions. =Classical jurisprudence= When veiling was discussed in early Islamic jurisprudence beyond the context of prayer, it was generally considered an \\"issue of social status and physical safety\\". Later, during the medieval era, Islamic jurists began to devote more attention to the notion of awra (intimate parts) and the question of whether women should cover their faces. The majority opinion which emerged during that time, predominant among Maliki and Hanafi jurists, held that women should cover everything except their faces in public. In contrast, most medieval Hanbali and Shafi'i jurists counted a woman's face among the awra, concluding that it should be veiled, except for the eyes. The Hanbali jurist Ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1328 CE) was an influential proponent of the latter view, while the Hanafi scholar Burhan al- Din al-Marghinani (d. 1197 CE) stressed that it was particularly important for a woman to leave her face and hands uncovered during everyday business dealing with men. There was a difference of opinion on this question within the legal schools. Thus, Yusuf al-Qaradawi quotes classical Shafi'i and Hanbali jurists stating that covering the face is not obligatory. In the Shi'a Ja'fari school of fiqh, covering the face is not obligatory. =Salafi views= According to the Salafi point of view, it is obligatory (fard) for a woman to cover her entire body when in public or in presence of non-mahram men. Some interpretations say that a veil is not compulsory in front of blind, asexual or gay men.Queer Spiritual Spaces: Sexuality and Sacred Places, p. 89, Kath Browne, Sally Munt, Andrew K. T. Yip - 2010 The Salafi scholar Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani wrote a book expounding his view that the face veil is not a binding obligation upon Muslim women, while he was a teacher at Islamic University of Madinah. His opponents within the Saudi establishment ensured that his contract with the university was allowed to lapse without renewal.Meijer, Global Salafism, pg. 66. =Reasons for wearing= There exists no single reason why women may wear the burqa, and this practice must be understood within a particular social context. A woman may wear it to express her piety, her views on sexual modesty, her rejection of Western notions of sexuality, her desire for increased mobility or privacy in a social environment dominated by men, or her membership in a political movement. In the most publicized context, women were required, often against their will, to wear the burqa by the Taliban as a matter of policy during their rule of Afghanistan. Around the world A map of countries with a Burqa ban. Map current as of 2019 =Africa=Cameroon In July 2015, Cameroon banned the face veil including the burqa after two women dressed in the religious garments committed a suicide attack killing 13.BBC: \\"Cameroon bans Islamic face veil after suicide bombings\\", Bbc.com, 16 July 2015.\\"Another African country bans Islamic veil for women over terror attacks\\", Washingtonpost.com, 18 June 2015. Chad In June 2015, the full face veil was banned in Chad after veiled Boko Haram bombers disguised as women committed multiple suicide attacks. Republic of the Congo In May 2015, the Republic of the Congo banned the face veil in order to counter extremism.\\"Congo-Brazzaville bans women from wearing full veil - Security reasons cited as the reason behind the ban, according to an Islamic association\\", Aljazeera.com, 3 May 2015 The decision was announced by El Hadji Djibril Bopaka, the president of the country's Islamic High Council.  Gabon  In 2015, Gabon banned the face veil in order to counter extremism in public and places of work.  Morocco  The Moroccan government distributed letters to businesses on 9 January 2017 declaring a ban on the sale, production and import of burqas. The letters indicated that businesses were expected to clear their stock within 48 hours. It is not illegal to wear a burqa in Morocco. =Asia=Afghanistan Local Afghan women wearing burqas on a street in 2009 Women wearing burqas of different colors Afghanistan in 1975) The full Afghan chadaree covers the wearer's entire face except for a small region about the eyes, which is covered by a concealing net or grille. They are usually light blue in the Kabul area, white in the north in Mazar-i-Sharif and brown and green in Kandahar in the south. The chadaree has been worn by Pashtun women since pre- Islamic times and was historically seen as a mark of respectability. Before the Taliban took power in Afghanistan, the chadaree was rarely worn in cities, especially Kabul. While they were in power, the Taliban required the wearing of a chadaree in public. Officially, it is no longer required under the present Afghan regime, but some local feudal lords still enforce it in some parts of Afghanistan. Chadaree use in the remainder of Afghanistan is variable and is observed to be gradually declining in Kabul. Due to political instability in these areas, women who might not otherwise be inclined to wear the chadaree must do so as a matter of personal safety. China In 2017, China banned the burqa in the Islamic area of Xinjiang. India Among the Muslim population in India (about 14.2% as of 2011 census), the burqa (, ) is common in many areas Old Delhi, for example. In the locale of Nizamuddin Basti, the obligation of a woman to wear a burqa is dependent on her age, according to a local informant: young, unmarried women or young, married women in their first years of marriage are required to wear the burqa. However, after this the husband usually decides if his wife should continue to wear a burqa. In addition, the Indian burqa is a slim black cloak different from the style worn in Afghanistan. Israel A member of the Haredi burqa sect in Meah Shearim, Israel Some years ago , a group of Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish women in Israel began donning the Burqa as a symbol of piety. Following its adoption by Bruria Keren, an estimated 600 Jewish women took to wearing the veil. Keren claims to \\"follow these rules of modesty to save men from themselves. A man who sees a woman's body parts is sexually aroused, and this might cause him to commit sin. Even if he doesn't actually sin physically, his impure thoughts are sin in themselves.\\" However, a rabbinical authority said \\"There is a real danger that by exaggerating, you are doing the opposite of what is intended [resulting in] severe transgressions in sexual matters,\\" and issued an edict declaring burka-wearing a sexual fetish, that is as promiscuous as wearing too little. According to The Jerusalem Post, in 2010, a Member of the Knesset intended to put forward a bill to \\"prohibit the wearing of a full-body and face covering for women. [The] bill would not differentiate between Muslims and Jews\\".The Jerusalem Post. 26 April 2010. . Retrieved 16 February 2011.  Sri Lanka  In April 2019, face-covering clothing was banned in Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings by jihadists. Syria Syria is a Baathist state and discourages the wearing of hijab. Ghiyath Barakat, Syria's minister of higher education, announced that the government would ban students, teachers or staff from covering faces at universities, stating that the veils ran counter to \\"secular and academic principles of the country\\".  Tajikistan  In 2017 the government of Tajikistan passed a law requiring people to \\"stick to traditional national clothes and culture\\", which has been widely seen as an attempt to prevent women from wearing Islamic clothing, in particular the style of headscarf wrapped under the chin, in contrast to the traditional Tajik headscarf tied behind the head. =Europe= thumbright200pxBurqa bans in Europe. Map current . Austria In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing in public spaces was adopted by the Austrian parliament including Islamic face- covering garments. The government stated that accepting and respecting Austrian values is essential to the peaceful co-existence between the Austrian majority population and immigrants. The ban came into force on 1 October 2017 and carried a fine of 150 euros. It is reported that there are 150 Austrian women who wear the burqa.https://www.economist.com/graphic- detail/2019/08/09/burqa-bans-have-proliferated-in-western-europe Belgium On 29 April 2010, the lower house of parliament in Belgium passed a bill banning any clothing that would obscure the identity of the wearer in places like parks and in the street. The proposal was passed without dissent, and was then also passed by the Senate. BBC News estimates that \\"Only around 30 women wear this kind of veil in Belgium, out of a Muslim population of around half a million.\\" The ban came into effect in Belgium in July 2011. On 11 July 2017 the ban in Belgium was upheld by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed. Bulgaria The Parliament of Bulgaria outlawed the wearing of any clothing \\"that partially or completely covers the face\\" in public places such as government offices, educational and cultural institutions, and places of public recreation, except for health or professional reasons from 30 September 2016. Anyone who violates the law is liable to a fine of up to 1,500 levs (US$860). The Muslim community makes up 15% of the Bulgarian population of 7.1 million.Cooperman, Alan; Sahgal, Neha; Schiller, Anna (10 May 2017). \\"Religious Belief and National Belonging in Central and Eastern Europe\\", p. 52. Pew Research Center. Retrieved 10 February 2018.  Denmark  In Denmark, the garment is often described as oppressing women and incompatible with Danish values. In autumn 2017, the Danish government agreed to adopt a law prohibiting people to wear \\"attire and clothing masking the face in such a way that it impairs recognizability\\". A full ban on both niqabs and burqas was announced on 31 May 2018. The ban came into force on 1 August 2018 and carries a fine of 1000 DKK, then about 134 euro; repeat offenses are punishable with fines up to 10 000 DKK. The law targets all garments that cover the face, such as fake beards or balaclavas. Supporters of the ban claim that the ban facilitates integration of Muslims into Danish society, while Amnesty International claimed the ban violated women's rights. On the date the law came into force, a protest numbering 300-400 people was held in Copenhagen's N√∏rrebro district organised by Socialist Youth Front, Kvinder i Dialog and Party Rebels, with protesters wearing various head coverings including party masks. Friedrich Fiegenwald Coy, however, pointed out that it is \\"almost as if Allah has sent the corona\\", since the burka's are replaced by face masks. France Wearing the burqa has not been allowed in French public schools since 2004 when it was judged to be a religious symbol like the Christian cross. This ruling was the application of an established 1905 law that prohibits students and staff from wearing any clearly visible religious symbols. The law relates to the time where the secular French state took over control of most schools from the Catholic Church. It does not apply to private or religious schools. This was followed on 22 June 2009, when the president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, said that burqas are \\"not welcome\\" in France, commenting that \\"In our country, we cannot accept that women be prisoners behind a screen, cut off from all social life, deprived of all identity\\". The French National Assembly appointed 32 lawmakers from right- and left-wing parties to a six-month fact-finding mission to look at ways of restricting its use. On 26 January 2010, the commission reported that access to public services and public transport should be barred to those wearing the burqa. On Tuesday 13 July 2010 the Assembly overwhelmingly approved a bill banning burqas and niqabs. On 14 September 2010, the French Senate overwhelmingly approved a ban on burqas in public, with the law becoming effective beginning on 11 April 2011. When the measure was sent in May to the parliament they said \\"Given the damage it produces on those rules which allow the life in community, ensure the dignity of the person and equality between sexes, this practice, even if it is voluntary, cannot be tolerated in any public place\\".French Senate Approves Burqa Ban (CNN) The ban is officially called \\"The bill to forbid concealing one's face in public\\". \\"It refers neither to Islam nor to veils. Officials insist the law against face-covering is not discriminatory because it would apply to everyone, not just Muslims. They cite a host of exceptions, including motorcycle helmets, or masks for health reasons, fencing, skiing or carnivals\\". In 2014, the European Court of Human Rights upheld the French ban on burqa, accepting the argument of the French government that the law was based on \\"a certain idea of living together\\". Germany In a 2016 speech, accepting her nomination for reelection, the German chancellor Angela Merkel called for banning the burqa in Germany \\"wherever legally possible\\", which was interpreted as support for the earlier proposal by Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi√®re to outlaw full-face veils in public buildings. The announcement was seen as an attempt to counter public anger at Merkel's handling of the migrant crisis and electoral gains by the anti-immigration AfD party. In 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for soldiers and state workers during work was approved by the German parliament. Also in 2017, a legal ban on face-covering clothing for car and truck drivers was approved by the German Ministry of Traffic. In July 2017 the state of Bavaria approved a ban on face-covering clothing for teachers, state workers and students at university and schools. In August 2017, the state of Lower Saxony banned the burqa along with the niqab in public schools. This change in the law was prompted by a Muslim pupil in Osnabr√ºck who wore the garment to school for years and refused to take it off. Since she has completed her schooling, the law was instituted to prevent similar cases in the future. In July 2020, the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg banned face-covering veils for pupils, which extended the ban which was already in force for school staff. Italy In Italy, by an anti-terrorism Law passed in 1975, it is forbidden to wear any dress that hides the face of a person. At that time, Italy was facing domestic (not Islam-related) terrorism. In May 2010, it was reported that a Tunisian woman was fined ‚Ç¨500 for this offence. Latvia It was wrongly claimed in foreign media that a legal ban of face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Latvian parliament. After long public discussions draft legislation was approved by Latvian government on 22.08.2017, however it was never adopted by the parliament as a law. Malta Malta has no restrictions on Islamic dressing such as the veil (hijab) nor the full face veil (burqa and/or niqab)Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 4 p. 393. but strictly speaking face covering is illegal.Dalli, Miriam (2015), \\"MP calls for banning of the burqa: ‚ÄòDecision requires rational debate‚Äô\\", Malta Today.

It is guaranteed that individuals are allowed to wear as they wish at their private homes and at the Mosque. Imam El Sadi, without quoting anyone and speaking from his own beliefs, as a spiritual guidance, that banning of the niqab and the burka \\"offends Muslim women\\". Elsadi said that the Maltese's \\"attitude towards Muslim women\\" is positive and, despite cultural clashes, they tolerate the dressing.\\"Muslim women should be able to wear hijab\\". Some Muslim women share the belief that it is sinful to be seen in public without veiling themselves; however, they are legally required to remove it when needed.J√∏rgen Nielsen; Samim Akg√∂n√ºl; Ahmet Aliba≈°iƒá; Egdunas Racius (2014), Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 6, Brill, p.411. Netherlands On 27 January 2012, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning any clothing that would hide the wearer's identity. Fines for wearing a burqa in public could go up to 380 euros. However, it did not pass in Parliament. In October 2012, this law was mitigated by the succeeding cabinet to pertain only to public transport, health care, education and government buildings, rather than all public spaces. On 22 May 2015, a bill was agreed upon by the Dutch cabinet, banning wearing a burqa in public places. Public places would have included public transportation, educational institutes, public health institutes, and government buildings. In the courtroom a burqa or a nikab could not be worn. In the public space a burqa and nikab would have been allowed. Police officers could have requested one to remove face-covering clothing for identification purposes. There were exceptions, such as during carnival or other festivities, and when face-covering clothing was necessary as a sports or job requirement. Opposition party D66 commented on the burqa abolishment as tokenism, while PVV labelled the ban unsatisfactory. Minister of Internal Affairs, Plasterk, has stated that setting a norm is important. The May 2015 bill did not pass either, but a new bill was proposed in November 2015, which was eventually made into law. On 26 June 2018, a partial ban on face covering (including burqas) on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions was enacted, with a number of exceptions. From 1 August 2019 a national burka ban was introduced in the Netherlands. As of August 2019, 200-400 Dutch women are believed to wear a burqa or niqab.https://www.sbs.com.au/news/dutch-burqa-ban-unworkable-on-first-day-as- police-transport-refuse-to-enforce-it Norway In June 2018, the parliament of Norway passed a bill banning clothing covering the face at educational institutions as well as daycare centres, which included face- covering Islamic veils. The prohibition applies to pupils and staff alike.  Sweden  In 2012, a poll by Uppsala University found that Swedes responded that face-covering Islamic veils are either completely unacceptable or fairly unacceptable, 85% for the burqa and 81% for the niqab. The researchers noted these figures represented a compact resistance to the face- covering veil by the population of Sweden. In December 2019, the municipality of Skurup banned Islamic veils in educational institutions. Earlier, the municipality of Staffanstorp approved a similar ban. Switzerland The burka was outlawed in the canton of Ticino after a citizen initiative to hold a referendum. With 65% in favour of a ban and it was ruled that the ban was constitutional, the ban took effect in July 2016. Those who violate the law face a fine of up to CHF 10,000. In September 2018, a ban on face-covering veils was approved with a 67% vote in favour in the canton of St Gallen. The largest Islamic community organisation in Switzerland, the Islamic Central Council, recommended that Muslim women continue to cover their faces. United Kingdom Face veils caused debate in the United Kingdom. A senior member of the previous government, Jack Straw, asked Muslim women from his constituency to remove any veils covering their faces during face-to-face meetings with him. He explained to the media that this was a request, not a demand, and that he made sure that a woman staffer remained in the room during the meeting. A media outcry followed. Some Muslim groups said that they understood his concerns, but others rejected them as prejudicial. A poll in 2011 indicated that 66 percent of British people supported banning the burqa in all public places. However, a ban on burqas was ruled out by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat government, and in 2018 Theresa May stated \\"we do not support a ban on the wearing of the veil in public\\". =Oceania=Australia In 2010, Australian Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi called for the burqa to be banned in Australia, branding it \\"un-Australian\\". The ban did not go ahead but the debate about the burqa continues. In 2011, Carnita Matthews of Sydney was sentenced to six months jail for making a statement accusing a police officer of attempting to forcibly lift her niqab, which news sources initially referred to incorrectly as a burqa. The officer had pulled her over for a random breath test and then ticketed her for a licence infringement. Matthews allegedly then submitted a signed complaint to a police station while wearing a niqab. Judge Clive Jeffreys overturned the conviction in June 2011, citing what he thought were differences between the signature on her license and that on the complaint. She then proceeded to seek legal costs. Matthews was subsequently revealed to have a considerable record of unpaid fines and licence revocations that cast doubt on her character. On 4 July 2011, New South Wales became the first Australian state to pass laws allowing police to demand that burqas (and other head gear such as motorcycle helmets) be removed when asking for identification. In October 2014, the Speaker of the House and President of the Senate at Parliament House in Canberra decreed that female visitors wearing a face covering would have to sit in the separated glassed-in areas of the public gallery normally reserved for schoolchildren. This was in response to a planned disruptive action by a political activist group. Prime Minister Tony Abbott stated that he opposed this restriction.\\"Tony Abbott steps in to have Parliament House burka restrictions overturned\\". ABC News, 3 October 2014. Retrieved 3 October 2014. The decision was subsequently reversed. In August 2017, Senator Pauline Hanson arrived at the Senate wearing a burqa in protest, calling for the garment to be banned. Following the incident, ReachTEL polled 2,832 Australians and found that the majority supported banning the wearing of the burqa in public places.ReachTEL survey (23 August 2017) https://powr.s3.amazonaws.com/app_images%2Fresizable%2F8fb90f02-cdc2-4dcd-9d81-7d87d3a9487c%2FSkyNewsReachel24August2017.pdf =Canada=Quebec On 18 October 2017, the Quebec provincial government passed bill 21,http://www.assnat.qc.ca/en/travaux- parlementaires/projets-loi/projet-loi-21-42-1.html which requires people to show their face when giving or receiving public services. The bill allows exemptions (including for religious motives) on a \\"case by case\\" basis, but despite this, the legislation was still regarded as a ban on burqas and niqabs by its detractors. , the ban has been suspended by at least two judges for violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. It was first suspended in December 2017.

He is best known as the lyricist of many rock and roll hits. Pomus was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a non-performer in 1992, the Songwriters Hall of Fame (1992), and the Blues Hall of Fame (2012). Early life Born Jerome Solon Felder in 1925 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, he was the son of Jewish immigrants. He attended Brooklyn College from 1943 to 1945. Felder became a fan of the blues after hearing a Big Joe Turner record. Having had polio as a boy, he walked with the help of crutches. Later, due to post-polio syndrome, exacerbated by an accident, Felder eventually relied on a wheelchair. His brother is New York attorney Raoul Felder. Career Using the stage name \\"Doc Pomus\\", teenager Felder began performing as a blues singer. His stage name was not inspired by anyone in particular; he just thought it sounded better for a blues singer than the name Jerry Felder. Pomus stated that more often than not, he was the only Caucasian in the clubs, but that as a Jew and a polio victim, he felt a special \\"underdog\\" kinship with African Americans, while in turn the audiences both respected his courage and were impressed with his talent. Gigging at various clubs in and around New York City, Pomus often performed with the likes of Milt Jackson, Mickey Baker and King Curtis. Pomus recorded approximately 40 sides as a singer in the '40s and '50s for record companies such as Chess, Apollo, Gotham and others. In the early 1950s, Pomus started writing magazine articles as well as songwriting for artists such as Lavern Baker, Ruth Brown, Ray Charles and Big Joe Turner to earn more money to support a family, after he had married Willi Burke, a Broadway actress. His first big songwriting break came when the Coasters had a hit with his song \\"Young Blood\\", though the tune had been radically rewritten by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Still, Pomus had co-credit as author, and he soon received a royalty check for $2,500 (US$ in dollars), which convinced him that songwriting was a career direction worth pursuing. By 1957, Pomus had given up performing for full-time songwriting. He collaborated with pianist Mort Shuman, whom he met when Shuman was dating Pomus's younger cousin, to write for Hill & Range Music Co./Rumbalero Music at its offices in New York City's Brill Building. Pomus asked Shuman to write with him because Pomus didn't then know much about rock and roll, whereas Shuman was familiar with many popular artists of the day. Their songwriting efforts had Pomus write the lyrics and Shuman the melody, although often they worked on both. They wrote the hit songs \\"A Teenager in Love\\", \\"Save The Last Dance For Me\\", \\"Hushabye\\", \\"This Magic Moment\\", \\"Turn Me Loose\\", \\"Sweets For My Sweet\\" (a hit for The Drifters and then The Searchers), \\"Go, Jimmy, Go\\", \\"Little Sister\\", \\"Can't Get Used to Losing You\\", \\"Suspicion\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"(Marie's the Name) His Latest Flame\\". During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Pomus wrote several songs with Phil Spector (\\"Young Boy Blues\\"; \\"Ecstasy\\"; \\"What Am I To Do?\\"), Mike Stoller and Jerry Leiber (\\"Young Blood\\" and \\"She's Not You\\"), and other Brill Building-era writers. Pomus also wrote \\"Lonely Avenue\\", a 1956 hit for Ray Charles. In the 1970s and 1980s, in his eleventh-floor, two-room apartment at the Westover Hotel at 253 West 72nd Street, Pomus wrote songs with Dr. John, Ken Hirsch and Willy DeVille for what he said were \\"...those people stumbling around in the night out there, uncertain or not always so certain of exactly where they fit in and where they were headed.\\" These later songs (\\"There Must Be A Better World\\", \\"There Is Always One More Time\\", \\"That World Outside\\", \\"You Just Keep Holding On\\", and \\"Something Beautiful Dying\\" in particular)‚Äîrecorded by Willy DeVille, B.B. King, Irma Thomas, Marianne Faithfull, Charlie Rich, Ruth Brown, Dr. John, James Booker, and Johnny Adams‚Äîare considered by some, including writer Peter Guralnick, musician and songwriter Dr. John, and producer Joel Dorn, to be signatures of his best craft. The documentary film A.K.A. Doc Pomus (2012), conceived by Pomus' daughter Sharyn Felder, directed by filmmaker Peter Miller, edited by Amy Linton and produced by Felder, Hechter and Miller, details Pomus' life. Pomus died on March 14, 1991 from lung cancer, at the age of 65 at NYU medical center in Manhattan. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Doc Pomus among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Legacy and influence Together with Shuman and individually, Pomus was a key figure in the development of popular music. They co-wrote such hits as \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\", \\"This Magic Moment\\", \\"Sweets for My Sweet\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", \\"Little Sister\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"Can't Get Used to Losing You\\", \\"Suspicion\\", \\"Turn Me Loose\\" and \\"A Mess of Blues\\". *Pomus was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. *In 1991 he was the first non-African-American recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award. Ray Charles presented the award via a pre-recorded message. *The funk band Cameo was heavily influenced by Pomus's song-writing style and frequently acknowledges his impact before performing their hit song \\"Word Up.\\" *Longtime friend jazz singer Jimmy Scott performed at Pomus's funeral, which performance singularly resurrected his career. Other attendees included Seymour Stein, who subsequently signed Scott to Sire Records, and Lou Reed, who thereafter would regularly work with Scott until his death. Pomus had been imploring his friends to see Scott play for many years. *The song \\"Doc's Blues\\" was written as a tribute to Pomus by his close friend, Andrew Vachss. The lyrics originally appeared in Vachss‚Äô 1990 novel Blossom. \\"Doc's Blues\\" was recorded by bluesman Son Seals, on Seals' last album, Lettin‚Äô Go. *Responsible for Lou Reed's introduction to the music industry in the early 1960s, Pomus was one of two friends Reed memorialized on his 1992 album Magic and Loss (the other was Rotten Rita). *In 1995, Rhino Records released a tribute album to Pomus entitled Till The Night Is Gone. Pomus songs are performed by Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, Dion, Dr. John, Irma Thomas, Solomon Burke, John Hiatt, Shawn Colvin, Aaron Neville, Lou Reed, The Band, B.B. King, Los Lobos and Rosanne Cash. *In 2010, Ben Folds and Nick Hornby named their collaborative album Lonely Avenue, on which the song \\"Doc Pomus\\" appeared. The lyrics referenced an excerpt from Pomus's uncompleted memoir, February 21, 1984: \\"I was never one of those happy cripples who stumbled around smiling and shiny-eyed, trying to get the world to cluck its tongue and shake its head sadly in my direction. They‚Äôd never look at me and say, 'What a wonderful, courageous fellow.'\\" The album featured lyrics written by British author Hornby, set to music by American performer Folds. It was released on September 28, 2010. *John Goodman's character in the Coen brothers' 2013 dramedy Inside Llewyn Davis was loosely inspired by Pomus. Pomus' song catalog in the U.S. territory is managed by his son-in-law Will Bratton through Spirit One Music.

It is contrasted with taqlid (imitation, conformity to legal precedent). According to classical Sunni theory, ijtihad requires expertise in the Arabic language, theology, revealed texts, and principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh), and is not employed where authentic and authoritative texts (Qur'an and Hadith) are considered unambiguous with regard to the question, or where there is an existing scholarly consensus (ijma). Ijtihad is considered to be a religious duty for those qualified to perform it. An Islamic scholar who is qualified to perform ijtihad is called a mujtahid. By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading Sunni jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted. In the modern era, this gave rise to a perception among Western scholars and lay Muslim public that the so- called \\"gate of ijtihad\\" was closed at the start of the classical era. While recent scholarship has disproved this notion, the extent and mechanisms of legal change in the post-formative period remain a subject of debate. Starting from the 18th century, some Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to Islamic origins. Public debates in the Muslim world surrounding ijtihad continue to the present day. The advocacy of ijtihad has been particularly associated with Islamic modernists and purist Salafi thinkers. Among contemporary Muslims in the West there have emerged new visions of ijtihad which emphasize substantive moral values over traditional juridical methodology. Shia jurists did not use the term ijtihad until the 12th century, but they employed a rational mode of legal reasoning from the early period, and its scope was not narrowed as in the Sunni tradition, with the exception of Zaydi jurisprudence. Etymology and definition The word derives from the three-letter Arabic verbal root of -H-D (', 'struggle'): the \\"t\\" is inserted because the word is a derived stem VIII verb. In its literal meaning, the word refers to effort, physical or mental, expended in a particular activity. In its technical sense, ijtihad can be defined as a \\"process of legal reasoning and hermeneutics through which the jurist-mujtahid derives or rationalizes law on the basis of the Qur'an and the Sunna\\". The juristic meaning of ijtihƒÅd has several definitions according to scholars of Islamic legal theory. Some define it as the jurist‚Äôs action and activity to reach a solution. Al-GhazƒÅlƒ´ (d. 505/1111) defines it as the ‚Äútotal expenditure of effort made by a jurist for the purpose of obtaining the religious rulings.‚Äù Similarly the ijtihƒÅd is defined as ‚Äúthe effort made by the mujtahid in seeking knowledge of the a·∏•kƒÅm (rulings) of the sharƒ´‚Äòah (Islamic canonical law) through interpretation.‚Äù From this point of view that ijtihƒÅd essentially consists of an inference (istinbƒÅ·π≠) that extents to a probability (·∫ìann). Thus it excludes the extraction of a ruling from a clear text as well as rulings made without recourse to independent legal reasoning. A knowledgeable person who gives a ruling on the sharƒ´‚Äòah, but is not able to exercise their judgement in the inference of the rulings from the sources, is not called a mujtahid but rather a muqallid. Scriptural basis Islamic scholar Asghar Ali Engineer cites a hadith related by a sahabi (companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad) by the name of Muadh ibn Jabal (also Ma‚Äôadh bin Jabal), as the basis for ijtihad. According to the hadith from Sunan Abu- Dawud, Book 24, Muadh was appointed by Muhammad to go to Yemen. Before leaving he was asked how he would judge when the occasion of deciding a case arose. > Ma‚Äôadh said, according to the Quran. The Prophet thereupon asked what he > would do if he did not find the solution to the problem in the Quran, to > which Ma‚Äôadh said he would govern according to the Sunnah. But when the > Prophet asked if he could not find it in the Sunnah also, Ma‚Äôadh said \\"ana > ajtahidu\\" (I will exert myself to find the solution). The Prophet thereupon > patted his back and told him he was right.see also: History=Formative period= During the early period, ijtihad referred to the exercise of one's discretionary opinion (ra'y) on the basis of the knowledge of the precedent (‚Äòilm). Jurists used ra'y to help reach legal rulings, in cases where the Qur'an and Sunna did not provide clear direction for certain decisions. It was the duty of the educated jurists to come to a ruling that would be in the best interest of the Muslim community and promote the public good. As religious law continued to develop over time, ra'y became insufficient in making sure that fair legal rulings were being derived in keeping with both the Qur'an and Sunna. However, during this time, the meaning and process of ijtihad became more clearly constructed. Ijtihad was ‚Äúlimited to a systematic method of interpreting the law on the basis of authoritative texts, the Quran and Sunna,‚Äù and the rulings could be ‚Äúextended to a new problem as long as the precedent and the new situation shared the same clause.‚Äù As the practice of ijtihad transformed over time, it became religious duty of a mujtahid to conduct legal rulings for the Muslim society. Mujtahid is defined as a Muslim scholar that has met certain requirements including a strong knowledge of the Qur'an, Sunna, and Arabic, as well as a deep understanding of legal theory and the precedent; all of which allows them to be considered fully qualified to practice ijtihad. = Classical era= Around the beginning of the 10th century, most Sunni jurists argued that all major matters of religious law had been settled, allowing for taqlid (ÿ™ŸÇŸÑŸäÿØ), \\"the established legal precedents and traditions,\\" to take priority over ijtihƒÅd (ÿßÿ¨ÿ™ŸáÿßÿØ). This move away from the practice of ijtihƒÅd was made by the Hanafƒ´ and Malikƒ´ law schools, and the majority of Shafƒ´ øis, but not by Hanbalƒ´s or a number of prominent Shafƒ´ øi jurists who believed that \\"true consensus\\" (ijmƒÅ ø ÿßÿ¨ŸÖÿßÿπ), apart from that of Muhammad's Companions, did not exist\\" and that \\"the constant continuous existence of mujtahids (ŸÖÿ¨ÿ™ŸáÿØ) was a theological requirement.\\" After the 11th century, Sunni legal theory developed systems for ranking jurists according to their qualifications for ijtihad. One such ranking placed the founders of maddhabs, who were credited with being \\"absolute mujtahids\\" (mujtahid mu·π≠laq) capable of methodological innovation, at the top, and jurists capable only of taqlƒ´d at the bottom, with mujtahids and those who combined ijtihƒÅd and taqlƒ´d given the middle ranks. In the 11th century, jurists required a mufti (jurisconsult) to be a mujtahid; by the middle of the 13th century, however, most scholars considered a muqallid (practitioner of taqlƒ´d) to be qualified for the role. During that era some jurists began to ponder whether practitioners of ijtihad continued to exist and the phrase \\"closing of the gate of ijtihƒÅd\\" (ÿ•ÿ∫ŸÑÿßŸÇ ÿ®ÿßÿ® ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¨ÿ™ŸáÿßÿØ iƒ°lƒÅq bƒÅb al-ijtihƒÅd) appeared after the 16th century. The settling of Sunni law and increasing prominence of taqlid has at one point led most Western scholars to believe that the \\"gate of ijtihad\\" was in fact effectively closed around 900 C.E. In a 1964 monograph, which exercised considerable influence on later scholars, Joseph Schacht wrote that \\"a consensus gradually established itself to the effect that from that time onwards no one could be deemed to have the necessary qualifications for independent reasoning in religious law, and that all future activity would have to be confined to the explanation, application, and, at the most, interpretation of the doctrine as it had been laid down once and for all.\\" While more recent research has disproved the notion that the practice of ijtihad was abandoned in the 10th century ‚Äî or even later ‚Äî the extent of legal change during this period and its mechanisms remain a subject of scholarly debate.Wael B. Hallaq, \\"On the origin of the Controversy about the Existence of Mutahids and the Gate of Ijtihad,\\" Studia Islamica, 63 (1986): 129 Shi'i Muslims recognized ‚Äúhuman reasoning and intellect as a legal source that supplements the Quran and other revealed texts,‚Äù thus continuing to acknowledge the importance of ijtihad. = Modern era = During the turn of the 16th to 17th century, Sunni Muslim reformers began to criticize taqlid, and promoted greater use of ijtihad in legal matters. They claimed that instead of looking solely to previous generations for practices developed by religious scholars, there should be an established doctrine and rule of behavior through the interpretation of original foundational texts of Islam‚Äîthe Qur'an and Sunna. Islamic modernism Starting in the middle of the 19th century, Islamic modernists such as Sir Sayyid Ahmed Khan, Jamal al-din Al-Afghani, and Muhammad Abduh emerged seeking to revitalize Islam by re-establish and reform Islamic law and its interpretations to accommodate Islam with modern society. They emphasized the use of ijtihad, but in contrast to its original use, they sought to \\"apply contemporary intellectual methods\\" such as academic or scientific thought \\"to the task of reforming Islam\\". Al- Afghani proposed the new use of ijtihad that he believed would enable Muslims to think critically and apply their own individual interpretations of the innovations of modernity in the context of Islam. One modernist argument for applying ijtihad to sharia law is that while \\"the principles and values underlying Sharia (i.e. usul al-fiqh)\\" are unalterable, human interpretation of sharia is not. Another, (made by Asghar Ali Engineer of India), is that the adaat (customs and traditions) of Arabs were used in the development of the sharia, and form an important part of it. They are very much not divine or immutable, and have no more legal justification to be part of the sharia than the adaat of Muslims living beyond the home of the original Muslim in the Arab Hejaz.

In Indonesia, following considerable debate among the ulema, Indonesian adaat \\"become part of Sharia as applicable in that country\\". This use of ijtihad to apply adaat applies to mu‚Äôamalat (socio-economic matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance), rather than Ibadah fiqh (ritual salat, sawm, zakat, etc.). Asghar Ali Engineer argues that while the Arab adaat the Quran was revealed in was \\"highly patriarchal\\" and still informs what is understood as sharia, the \\"transcendental Quranic vision\\" is for \\"absolutely equal rights\\" between genders and should guide ijtihad of sharia. Islamism and Salafism Contemporary Salafis are major proponents of ijtihad. They criticize taqlid and believe ijtihad makes modern Islam more authentic and will guide Muslims back to the Golden Age of early Islam. Salafis assert that reliance on taqlid has led to Islam's decline. The Muslim Brotherhood traces its founding philosophies to al-Afghani's ijtihad. The Muslim Brotherhood holds that the practice of ijtihad will strengthen the faith of believers by compelling them to better familiarize themselves with the Quran and come to their own conclusions about its teachings. But as a political group the Muslim Brotherhood faces a major paradox between ijtihad as a religious matter and as a political one. Ijtihad weakens political unity and promotes pluralism, (which is also why many oppressive regimes reject ijtihads legitimacy). The Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini envisioned a prominent role for ijtihad in his political theory of \\"guardianship of the jurist\\" (vilƒÅyat-e faqƒ´h). Osama Bin Laden supported ijtihad. He criticized the Saudi regime for disallowing the \\"free believer\\" and imposing harsh restrictions on successful practice of Islam. Thus, Bin Laden believed his striving for the implementation of ijtihad was his \\"duty\\" (takleef). Qualifications of a mujtahid A mujtahid (, \\"diligent\\") is an individual who is qualified to exercise ijtihad in the evaluation of Islamic law. The female equivalent is a mujtahida. In general mujtahids must have an extensive knowledge of Arabic, the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and legal theory (Usul al-fiqh). Sunni Islam and Shi'i Islam, due to their divergent beliefs regarding the persistence of divine authority, have different views on ijtihad and the qualifications required to achieve mujtahid. In order to clarify how ijtihad differs in Sunni and Shi'i Islam it is necessary to explore the historical development of this position in both branches. =Sunni= In the years immediately following Mohammed's death, Sunni Muslims practiced ijtihad because they saw it as an acceptable form of the continuation of sacred instruction. Sunni Muslims, therefore, began to practice ijtihad primarily through the use of personal opinion, or ra'y. As Muslims turned to the Quran and Sunnah to solve their legal issues, they began to recognize that these divine proponents did not deal adequately with certain topics of law. Therefore, Sunni Muslims began to find other ways and sources for ijtihad such as ra'y, which allowed for personal judgment of Islamic law. Sunni Muslims justified this practice of ra'y with a particular hadith, which cites Muhammad's approval of forming an individual sound legal opinion if the Qur'an and Sunnah contain no explicit text regarding that particular issue. Therefore, during the first two and a half centuries of Islam there were no restrictions placed on scholars interested in practicing ijtihad. Beginning in the 9th century, jurists began to make more restrictions on who could practice ijtihad and the kinds of qualifications necessary. Therefore, the practice of ijtihad became limited to a qualified scholar and jurist otherwise known as a mujtahid. Abu'l-Husayn al-Basri provides the earliest and most expansive outline for the qualifications of a mujtahid, they include: * Enough knowledge of Arabic so that the scholar can read and understand both the Qur'an and the Sunnah. * Extensive comprehensive knowledge of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. More specifically, the scholar must have a full understanding of the Qur'an's legal contents. In regards to the Sunnah the scholar must understand the specific texts that refer to law and also the incidence of abrogation in the Sunnah. * Must be able to confirm the consensus (Ijma) of the Companions, the Successors, and the leading Imams and mujtahideen of the past, in order to prevent making decisions that disregard these honored decisions made in the past. * Should be able to fully understand the objectives of the sharia and be dedicated to the protection of the Five Principles of Islam, which are life, religion, intellect, lineage, and property. * Be able to distinguish strength and weakness in reasoning, or in other words exercise logic. * Must be sincere and a good person. From the declaration of these requirements of mujtahid onwards, legal scholars adopted these characteristics as being standard for anyone looking to practice ijtihad. In order for the reasoning of these mujtahids to be accepted as law multiple mujtahids had to reach ijma. This allowed for mujtahids to openly discuss their particular views and reach a conclusion together. The interaction required by ijma allowed for mujtahids to circulate ideas and eventually merge to create particular Islamic schools of law (madhhabs). This consolidation of mujtahids into particular madhhabs prompted these groups to create their own distinct authoritative rules. These laws reduced issues of legal uncertainty that had been present when multiple mujtahids were working together with one another. However, with this introduction of common laws for each madhhab, legal scholars began to dismiss the practice of independent ijtihad and instead maintained the title of mujtahid only for the founders of the four main schools of Islamic law (Hanafiyya, Malikiyya, Shafiyya, Hanbaliyya). Therefore, from the 12th century onwards jurists could occupy the position of a mujtahid or access ijtihad in only two cases, when distinguishing between the manifest and the obscure views of their particular schools or when they served as \\"imitators\\" of mujtahids, expressing the views of the more qualified mujtahids before them. Therefore, the practice of ijtihad was restricted in favor of taqlid. =Shi'a= The Shi'a Muslims understand the process of ijtihad as being the independent effort used to arrive at the rulings of sharia. Following the death of the Prophet and once they had determined the Imam as absent, ijtihad evolved into a practice of applying careful reason in order to uncover the knowledge of what Imams would have done in particular legal situations. The decisions the Imams would have made were explored through the application of the Qur'an, Sunnah, ijma and 'aql (reason). It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that the title of mujtahid became associated with the term faqih or one who is an expert in jurisprudence. From this point on religious courts began to increase in number and the ulama were transformed by Shi'i Islamic authorities into the new producer of ijtihad. In order to produce perceptive mujtahids that could fulfill this important role, principles of Shi'i jurisprudence were developed to provide a foundation for scholarly deduction of Islamic law. Shaykh Murtada Ansari and his successors developed the school of Shi'i law, dividing the legal decisions into four categories of certainty (qat), valid conjecture (zann), doubt (shakk), and erroneous conjecture (wahm). These rules allowed mujtahids to issue adjudications on any subject, that could be derived through this process of ijtihad, demonstrating their great responsibility to the Shi'i community Furthermore, according to Shi'i Islamic Jurisprudence a believer of Islam is either a Mujtahid (one that expresses their own legal reasoning), or a Muqallid (one performing Taqlid of a Mujtahid) and a Muhtat (one who acts with precaution). Most Shi'i Muslims qualify as Muqallid, and therefore are very dependent on the rulings of the Mujtahids. Therefore, the Mujtahids must be well prepared to perform ijtihad, as the community of Muqallid are dependent on their rulings. Not only did Shi'i Muslims require: * Knowledge of the texts of the Qur'an and Sunnah * Justice in matters of public and personal life * Utmost piety * Understanding of the cases where Shi'i mujtahids reached consensus * Ability to exercise competence and authority However, these scholars also depended on further training that could be received in religious centers called Hawza. At these centers they are taught the important subjects and technical knowledge a mujtahid need be proficient in such as: * Arabic grammar and literature * Logic * Extensive knowledge of the Qur'anic sciences and Hadith * Science of narrators * Principle of Jurisprudence * Comparative Jurisprudence Therefore, Shi'i mujtahids remain revered throughout the Shi'i Islamic world. The relationship between the mujtahids and muqallids continues to address and solve the contemporary legal issues. Participating in ijtihad, however, has been cautioned by scholars for those not properly educated in interpretation of the Qu'ran. This is narrated by Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, the great grandson of Muhammad, when he cautioned Aban ibn abi-Ayyash, a fellow companion, saying, \\"Oh brother from 'Abd Qays, if the issue becomes clear to you, then accept it. Otherwise remain silent and defer to Allah because your interpretation from the truth will be as far from the Earth as the sky.\\" =Female mujtahids= A woman can be a mujtahid and there are dozens who have attained the rank in the modern history of Iran (for instance, Amina Bint al- Majlisi in the Safavid era, Bibi Khanum in the Qajar era, Lady Amin in the Pahlavi era, and Zohreh Sefati during the time of the Islamic Republic).See: Mirjam K√ºnkler and Roja Fazaeli, ‚ÄúThe Life of Two Mujtahidas: Female Religious Authority in 20th Century Iran‚Äù, in Women, Leadership and Mosques: Changes in Contemporary Islamic Authority, ed. Masooda Bano and Hilary Kalmbach (Brill Publishers, 2012), 127-160. There are diverging opinions as to whether a female mujtahid can be a marja ª or not. Zohreh Sefati and some male jurists believe a female mujtahida can become a marja‚Äò, ‚Äîin other words, they believe that believers perform taqlid (emulation) of a female mujtahid‚Äî but many male jurists believe a marja ª must be male.

Background and education Mary Lilian Baels was born in London, England, where her parents had fled during World War I. She was one of the nine children of Henri Baels from Ostend and his wife, Anne Marie de Visscher, a member of the Belgian nobility from Dentergem. Lilian was called \\"Lily\\" in her family circle. Lilian was initially educated in English, but, upon her parents' return to Belgium, she attended the College of the Sacred Heart in Ostend, where she learned Dutch. Lilian continued her studies in French in Brussels. She was also fluent in German. Lilian completed her education by attending the Holy Child finishing school in London. In addition to academic work, Lilian participated extensively in sports, such as skiing, swimming, golfing, and hunting. Above all, however, she enjoyed, as did her father, literature and the arts. As a teenager, she was presented to King George V and Queen Mary of the United Kingdom at Buckingham Palace.Jean Cleeremans, L√©opold III, sa famille, son peuple sous l'occupation Friendship with the Belgian royal family In 1933, Lilian saw her future husband, King Leopold III of Belgium, then still Duke of Brabant, for the first time during a military review. A few years later, when her father, then Governor of West Flanders, took his daughter to a public ceremony, she had the occasion to meet King Leopold, who presided at the event, for the second time. In 1937, Lilian and her mother met the King, now a widower, again on another ceremonial occasion. Soon afterwards, King Leopold III contacted Governor Baels to invite him and his daughter to join him in a golfing party the next day. Lilian also saw the King in 1939 at a garden-party organised in honour of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, and later at the golf course at Laeken, where she was invited to lunch by Queen Elisabeth of Belgium, King Leopold's mother. A final golf party near the Belgian coast occurred in May 1940, shortly before the Nazi invasion of Belgium.Jean Cleeremans, ', Roger Keyes, Echec au Roi: L√©opold III, 1940‚Äì1951 Beginnings of World War II in Belgium Following the Nazi invasion of Belgium, Lilian's mother put herself at the service of the Red Cross during the Belgian and Allied military campaign against the invaders. Lilian helped her mother actively in her new role, transporting Belgian and French wounded by car to the hospital of St. John in Bruges. Meanwhile, her father, Governor Baels, attempted to alleviate the plight of his invaded province. On 18 May, Henri Baels went in search of the Minister of the Interior, thinking he had left for France, to obtain his signature for an important relief measure. On his journey, however, Governor Baels had a car accident and injured his legs. He was admitted to a hospital in Le Havre. As the military situation in Belgium headed towards disaster, his wife decided to bring her daughters to safety in France, and Lilian drove the family car on the trip. Governor Baels' wife and daughters met him again, by pure chance, in a hospital in Poitiers. Baels was subsequently accused of having abandoned his post as Governor without justification by fleeing to France. He succeeded, however, in obtaining an audience with the King following the capitulation of the Belgian army on 28 May 1940 and the King's own imprisonment by the Germans at Laeken Castle. Baels and his daughter Lilian, who drove him to the audience, explained the real circumstances of his departure from Belgium, and the Governor was thereby vindicated. Subsequently, Lilian and her father returned to France and occupied themselves with the care of Belgian refugees in the region of Anglet. After Belgium's liberation, Henri Baels was accused of collaborating with the Nazis during the war, but this is clearly false, since he did not act as governor during the occupation and lived in France throughout the period.Jean Cleeremans, ', Roger Keyes, ' Marriage and controversy In 1941, at the invitation of Queen Elisabeth, Lilian visited Laeken Castle, where King Leopold III, now a prisoner of war, was held by the Germans under house arrest. This visit was followed by several others, with the result that Leopold III and Lilian fell in love. Leopold proposed marriage to Lilian in July 1941, but Lilian declined his offer. \\"Kings only marry princesses,\\" she said. Queen Elisabeth, however, prevailed upon Lilian to accept the King's offer. Lilian agreed to marry the King, but declined the title of queen. Instead, the King gave Lilian the title Princess of Belgium, and Princess of R√©thy with the style Royal Highness. It was agreed that descendants of the King's new marriage would be titled Prince/Princess of Belgium with the style Royal Highness but excluded from succession to the throne. Leopold and Lilian initially planned to hold their official, civil marriage after the end of the war and the liberation of Belgium, but in the meantime, a secret religious marriage ceremony took place on 11 September 1941, in the chapel of Laeken Castle, in the presence of Queen Elisabeth, Henri Baels, and Cardinal van Roey, Archbishop of Mechelen and primate of Belgium. This actually contravened Belgian law, which required that the religious wedding be preceded by the civil one. Although Lilian and Leopold had originally planned to postpone their civil marriage until the end of the war, Lilian was soon expecting her first child, necessitating a civil marriage, which took place on 6 December 1941. The civil marriage automatically made Lilian a Princess of Belgium. Lilian proved a devoted wife to the King and an affectionate and vivacious stepmother to his children by his first wife, Queen Astrid.Jean Cleeremans, ', Roger Keyes, ' When the civil marriage of Leopold and Lilian was made public in a pastoral letter by Cardinal van Roey read throughout Belgian churches in December 1941, there was a mixed reaction in Belgium. Some showed sympathy for the new couple, sending flowers and messages of congratulations to the palace at Laeken.Jean Cleeremans, ' Others, however, argued that the marriage was incompatible with the King's status as a prisoner-of-war and his stated desire to share the hard fate of his conquered people and captive army, and was a betrayal of Queen Astrid's memory. They also branded Lilian as a social-climber.L√©opold III, by Vincent Dujardin, Mark van den Wijngaert, et al. One of the leading Belgian newspapers rebuked King Leopold: \\"Sire, we thought you had your face turned towards us in mourning. Instead you had it hidden in the shoulder of a woman.\\" Leopold and Lilian were also blamed for violating Belgian law by holding their religious marriage before their civil one. These criticisms would continue for many years, even after the war. According to Lilian's account, the news of her secret marriage with King Leopold upset and worried her mother, who foresaw that it would provoke a political storm. Her mother quoted \\"My little one, you don't know what's in store for you. It will be appalling, they will all attack you, you will have a terribly hard life.\\"Un couple dans la temp√™te: le destin malheureux de L√©opold III de Belgique et de la princesse Lilian (2004) (pp. 36-37). Queen Astrid's parents, Prince Carl and Princess Ingeborg of Sweden, did not take the hard line against King Leopold's remarriage. Princess Ingeborg told a Belgian journalist that she couldn't understand all the animus in Belgium against the king's second marriage, that it was perfectly natural for a young man not to want to remain alone forever. She said she was happy about her son-in-law's new marriage, both for his own sake and for the sake of her grandchildren. Deportation to Nazi Germany In 1944, the Belgian royal family was deported to Nazi Germany, where they were strictly guarded by 70 members of the SS, under harsh conditions. The family suffered from a deficient diet and lived with the constant fear that they would be massacred by their jailers, as an act of revenge on the part of the Nazis, angered at their defeat (by now becoming increasingly certain) by the Allies, or that they would be caught in the cross-fire between Allied forces and their captors, who might try to make a desperate last stand at the site of the royal family's internment. The family's fears were not unfounded. At one point, a Nazi official tried to give them cyanide, pretending it was a mixture of vitamins to compensate for the captives' poor diet during their imprisonment. Lilian and Leopold, however, were rightly suspicious and did not take the pills or give them to their children. During their period of captivity in Germany, (and later Austria), Leopold and Lilian jointly homeschooled the royal children. The King taught scientific subjects; his wife, arts and literature. In 1945, the Belgian royal family was liberated by American troops under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Patch, who thereafter became a close friend of King Leopold and Princess Lilian.Jean Cleeremans, in 'L√©opold III by Vincent Dujardin, Mark van den Wijngaert, et al. \\"Royal Question\\" and the aftermath Following his liberation, King Leopold was unable to return to Belgium (by now liberated as well) due to a political controversy that arose in Belgium surrounding his actions during World War II. He was accused of having betrayed the Allies by an allegedly premature surrender in 1940 and of collaborating with the Nazis during the occupation of Belgium. In 1946, a juridical commission was constituted in Brussels to investigate the King's conduct during the war and occupation. During this period, the king and his family lived in exile in Pregny-Chamb√©sy, Switzerland, and the King's younger brother, Prince Charles, Count of Flanders, was made regent of the country. The commission of inquiry eventually exonerated Leopold of the charges and he was able, in 1950, to return to Belgium and resume his royal duties. Political agitation against the King continued, however, leading to civil disturbances in what became known as the Royal Question. As a result, in 1951, to avoid tearing the country apart and to save the embattled monarchy, King Leopold III abdicated in favour of his 21-year-old son, Prince Baudouin. In the first nine years reign of her stepson, King Baudouin, Lilian acted as First Lady of Belgium. At the same period, Lilian also became the senior lady of the court and the lady of the household. King Leopold and Princess Lilian continued to live in the royal palace at Laeken until Baudouin's marriage to Do√±a Fabiola de Mora y Arag√≥n in 1960.  Life in Argenteuil  In 1960, following the marriage of King Baudouin, Leopold and Lilian moved out of the royal palace to a government property, the estate of Argenteuil, Belgium. Lilian employed various designers to transform the dilapidated mansion on the property into a distinguished and elegant residence for the ex-King. Argenteuil became a cultural centre under the auspices of Leopold and Lilian, who cultivated the friendship of numerous prominent writers, scientists, mathematicians, and doctors. Leopold and Lilian also travelled extensively all over the world. Following her son Alexandre's heart surgery in the United States during his childhood, Princess Lilian became very interested in medicine, and, in particular, in cardiology, and founded a Cardiological Foundation which, through its work, has saved the lives of hundreds of people. Both before and after her husband's death in 1983, Lilian pursued her interests in intellectual and scientific spheres with energy and passion.Michel Verwilghen, ' Her belongings from the chateau were put up at auction in Amsterdam.\\"Sotheby's Princess Lilian of Belgium Amsterdam 22 and 23 September 2003\\" (Catalogue, 185 pages) Character and reputation Lilian was known as a woman who was terribly strict and demanding towards herself, and, a result, as one who could be excessively severe with others as well. Due to the controversy surrounding King Leopold's wartime actions, and, in particular, his second marriage, Lilian was widely unpopular in Belgium. She also, however, had a circle of close friends, who saw her as a woman of great beauty, charm, intelligence, elegance, strength of character, kindness, generosity, humor and culture. They admired her for the courage and dignity with which she faced a long series of personal attacks, both during the Royal Question and for decades afterwards.Michel Verwilghen, ', 2006\\"\\", an article by Jacques Franck, published in ', 29 October 2003 Children Lilian had three children with King Leopold III: *Prince Alexandre of Belgium (1942‚Äì2009).

Before her death, she had expressed the desire to be buried at Argenteuil. Her wish was denied, however, and she was buried in the royal crypt of the Church of Our Lady, Laeken, Belgium, with King Leopold and his first wife, Queen Astrid. Queen Fabiola and Lilian's stepchildren attended the funeral, as did Lilian's son Alexandre and her daughter Marie-Esmeralda. Lilian's long-estranged daughter Marie-Christine did not attend. Following Princess Lilian's death, a cardiological conference was organised and prominent doctors and surgeons such as DeBakey and many others rendered an homage to Lilian and her contributions to cardiology.Jacques Franck, \\"\\", published 29 October 2003 in '  Titles and styles  *28 November 1916 ‚Äì 11 September 1941: Miss Mary Lilian Baels *11 September 1941 ‚Äì 7 June 2002: Her Royal Highness The Princess of R√©thy  References Bibliography *Jean Cleeremans.

A key characteristic is that design precedes manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator largely concurrent with the act of its creation. All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can take many forms. It can be conducted by an individual or a team, and such a team could include people with varied expertise (e.g. industrial designers, engineers, business experts, etc.). It can emphasize intuitive creativity or calculated scientific decision-making, and often emphasizes both. It can be influenced by factors as varied as materials, production processes, business strategy, and prevailing social, commercial, or aesthetic attitudes. Industrial design, as an applied art, most often focuses on a combination of aesthetics and user-focused considerations, but also often provides solutions for problems of form, function, physical ergonomics, marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.de Noblet, J., Industrial Design, Paris: A.F.A.A. (1993) History=Precursors= For several millennia before the onset of industrialisation, design, technical expertise, and manufacturing were often done by individual craftsmen, who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship. The division of labour that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era. The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as Florence, Venice, Nuremberg and Bruges, where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique. Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in Italy and Germany of pattern books: collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application. The use of drawing to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by architects and shipwrights during the Italian Renaissance. In the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as France led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomised by the Gobelins Manufactory, opened in Paris in 1667 by Louis XIV. Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from tapestries and furniture to metalwork and coaches, all under the creative supervision of the King's leading artist Charles Le Brun. This pattern of large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the Meissen porcelain workshops established in 1709 by the Grand Duke of Saxony, where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous. As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased. =Birth of industrial design= The emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in Great Britain in the mid 18th century. The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, urbanisation changed patterns of consumption, the growth of empires broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider middle class created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population. The first use of the term \\"industrial design\\" is often attributed to the industrial designer Joseph Claude Sinel in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade. Christopher Dresser is considered among the first independent industrial designers. Industrial design's origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance the Deutscher Werkbund, founded in 1907 and a precursor to the Bauhaus, was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the United States. The earliest use of the term may have been in The Art Union, A monthly Journal of the Fine Arts, 1839. The Practical Draughtsman's Book of Industrial Design by Jacques-Eug√®ne Armengaud was printed in 1853. The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a \\"complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing.\\" The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design. This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States. Robert Lepper helped to establish one of the country's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at Carnegie Institute of Technology.\\"Newsbriefs: Lepper show runs at Warhol.\\" Carnegie Mellon Magazine. Winter 2002. Retrieved January 17, 2014. Education Product design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design, information design, and interaction design. Various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called functionalist school.Pulos, Arthur J., The American Design Adventure 1940-1975, Cambridge, Mass:MIT Press (1988), p. 249 () Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, the former is considered an applied art while the latter is an applied science. Educational programs in the U.S. for engineering require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD). Of course, engineering education requires heavy training in mathematics and physical sciences, which is not typically required in industrial design education. =Institutions= Most industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two to four years of study. The study results in a Bachelor of Industrial Design (B.I.D.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as Master of Design, Master of Fine Arts and others to a Master of Arts or Master of Science. Definition Industrial design studies function and form‚Äîand the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who focus on the mechanical and other functional aspects of the product, assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations. Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers, because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from Carnegie Mellon's School of Design, \\"Design is the process of taking something from its existing state and moving it to a preferred state\\" (Simon, Herbert A. \\"The sciences of the artiÔ¨Åcial.\\" Cambridge, MA (1969, 1981, 1996)). This applies to new artifacts, whose existing state is undefined, and previously created artifacts, whose state stands to be improved. Industrial design can overlap significantly with engineering design, and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general engineering focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on aesthetic and user-interface aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by credentials and/or licensure required to engage in the practice of engineering. \\"Industrial design\\" as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of industrial engineering, except for the latter's sub-specialty of ergonomics. At the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows: \\"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences.\\" An extended version of this definition is as follows: \\"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what‚Äôs possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres. Industrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. \\"ICSID webÔºöDEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN Design process A Fender Stratocaster with sunburst finish, one of the most widely recognized electric guitars in the world Model 1300 Volkswagen Beetle Although the process of design may be considered 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, computer-aided industrial design and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use industrial CT scanning to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product. Product characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, colors, texture, form, and aspects concerning the use of the product. Additionally they may specify aspects concerning the production process, choice of materials and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the point of sale. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving usability, lowering production costs and developing more appealing products. Industrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to aesthetics, usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns‚Äîsuch as psychology, desire, and the emotional attachment of the user. These values and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary‚Äîbetween different schools of thought, and among practicing designers. Industrial design rights Industrial design rights are intellectual property rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. A design patent would also be considered under this category. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three- dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, a WIPO-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired. Examples of industrial design Lurelle Guild. Vacuum Cleaner, c. 1937. Brooklyn Museum Chair by Charles Eames Russel Wright. Coffee Urn, c. 1935 Brooklyn Museum A number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. Alvar Aalto, renowned as an architect, also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. Raymond Loewy was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the Royal Dutch Shell corporate logo, the original BP logo (in use until 2000), the PRR S1 steam locomotive, the Studebaker Starlight (including the later bulletnose), as well as Schick electric razors, Electrolux refrigerators, short-wave radios, Le Creuset French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items. Dick Teague, who spent most of his career with the American Motors Corporation, originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the Pacer, Gremlin, Matador coupe, Jeep Cherokee, and the complete interior of the Eagle Premier. Milwaukee's Brooks Stevens was best known for his Milwaukee Road Skytop Lounge car and Oscar Mayer Wienermobile designs, among others. Viktor Schreckengost designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art's school of industrial design. Oskar Barnack was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the Leica, which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design. Charles and Ray Eames were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the Eames Lounge Chair Wood and Eames Lounge Chair. Other influential designers included Henry Dreyfuss, Eliot Noyes, John Vassos, and Russel Wright. Dieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and the Functionalist school of industrial design. Many of Apple's recent products were designed by Sir Jonathan Ive.

The tenor (higher) voice was Sam Moore (born 1935) and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was Dave Prater (1937‚Äì1988). Nicknamed \\"Double Dynamite\\", \\"The Sultans of Sweat\\", and \\"The Dynamic Duo\\" for their gritty, gospel-infused performances, Sam & Dave are considered one of the greatest live acts of the 1960s. Many subsequent musicians have named them as an influence, including Bruce Springsteen, Al Green, Tom Petty, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Elvis Costello, The Jam, Teddy Pendergrass, Billy Joel and Steve Winwood. The Blues Brothers, who helped create a resurgence of popularity for soul, R&B;, and blues in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam & Dave ‚Äì their biggest hit was a cover of \\"Soul Man\\", and their act and stage show contained many homages to the duo. According to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Sam & Dave were the most successful soul duo and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records. Recorded primarily at Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee, from 1965 through 1968, these included \\"Soul Man\\", \\"Hold On, I'm Comin'\\", \\"You Don't Know Like I Know\\", \\"I Thank You\\", \\"When Something is Wrong with My Baby\\", \\"Wrap It Up\\", and many other Southern Soul classics. Except for Aretha Franklin, no soul act during Sam & Dave's Stax years (1965‚Äì1968) had more consistent R&B; chart success, including 10 consecutive top 20 singles and three consecutive top 10 LPs.An Anthology of Sam & Dave: The Stax Years: 1965 to 1968 CD liner notes page 1 Rob Bowman Their crossover charts appeal (13 straight appearances and two top 10 singles) helped to pave the way for the acceptance of soul music by white pop audiences, and their song \\"Soul Man\\" was one of the first songs by a black group to top the pop charts using the word \\"soul\\", helping define the genre. \\"Soul Man\\" was a number one Pop Hit (Cashbox: November 11, 1967) and has been recognized as one of the most influential songs of the past 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone magazine, and RIAA Songs of the Century. \\"Soul Man\\" was featured as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film and also a 1997‚Äì1998 television series, and Soul Men was a 2008 feature film. Sam & Dave are inductees in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Memphis Music Hall of Fame, and the Rhythm & Blues Music Hall of Fame. They won a Grammy Award for \\"Soul Man\\" and they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Rolling Stone ranked Sam & Dave No. 14 its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Early years Sam Moore and Dave Prater's early musical backgrounds involved listening to and singing gospel music in their homes and churches, and in Dave's case, also singing gospel in the choir in his church. Dave later sang with his older brother JT Prater in the gospel group The Sensational Hummingbirds, who recorded \\"Lord Teach Me\\" in the 1950s. Sam recorded \\"Nitey- Nite\\"/\\"Caveman Rock\\" in 1954 with the doo-wop group The Majestics, and later sang with the gospel groups The Gales and The Mellonaires. Moore and Prater listed Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke as influences on their styles,Sam & Dave ‚Äì An Oral History Moore & Marsh, Avon Books 1998 pp 24‚Äì25,27‚Äì28 and Moore was also influenced by Little Willie John, whom he and Dave opened for often in the early 1960s. Sam & Dave met working the gospel music circuit, and later in small clubs in Miami during amateur nights in 1961 according to Dave.Interview with Dave Prater and Dave Booth cover of 1984 I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down LP They sang together one night at the King of Hearts club, and started working together immediately thereafter, developing a live act featuring gospel-inspired call-and-response. Soul singer and record producer Steve Alaimo discovered them while performing during the same show with them at the King of Hearts nightclub in Miami and signed them to Marlin Records. After two singles in early 1962 were released on the local Marlin label owned by Miami's Henry Stone, Stone helped sign them to Roulette Records in New York City. They released six 45s from 1962 to 1964 (two were re-releases of Marlin recordings) with Roulette, and one single on Stone and Alaimo's Alston Label. A few of the singles received regional airplay, but did not achieve national chart success. The songs, some of which were produced by Steve Alaimo and some of which were produced by Henry Glover, were similar in many ways to R&B; recordings by Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Little Willie John. Prater was the lead vocalist on most of these singles, with Moore singing harmony and alternate verses. In summer 1964, Stone introduced the duo to Atlantic Records' Jerry Wexler, who signed them to Atlantic.Soulville, Bowman pp 66‚Äì69 Wexler asked Memphis, Tennessee-based Stax Records, which Atlantic distributed nationally, to work with Sam & Dave. Wexler wanted the Southern roots and gospel style of their live performances, so the pair were loaned to Stax to record, although they remained Atlantic Records artists. According to Wexler's autobiography Rhythms & Blues, \\"Their live act was filled with animation, harmony and seeming goodwill. I put Sam in the sweet tradition of Sam Cooke or Solomon Burke, while Dave had an ominous Four Tops' Levi Stubbs-sounding voice, the preacher promising hellfire.\\" Stax years (1965‚Äì1968)=Arrival at Stax and early Stax singles= Sam & Dave in 1966 When Sam & Dave arrived at Stax, they worked with producer & engineer Jim Stewart and songwriters including the MGs' guitarist Steve Cropper, who wrote or co-wrote four of their first eight recordings. The duo then moved to relative newcomer writers and producers Isaac Hayes and David Porter. Hayes and Porter wrote and produced the duo's biggest hits (although they did not receive production credits until the Soul Men LP and singles). According to Moore and Prater, they also greatly influenced the duo's singing style,Soulsville, Bowman pp 67‚Äì69 and shifted their recording style from the style of their Roulette records to a more live, more energetic gospel, call-and-response feel and beat driven soul style the group is known for today. Sam & Dave's Stax records also benefited from the musicians and engineering at Stax. The Stax house band, Booker T. & the M.G.'s, and the Stax horn section, the Mar-Keys, were world-class musicians who co-wrote (often without credit) and contributed to recordings‚Äîthe same musicians who recorded with Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, Carla Thomas and other soul artists. Sam & Dave's Stax recordings through 1967 were engineered by Stax founder Jim Stewart, who created the Memphis Sound by recording live in a single take. Stewart is credited for instrumental mixes that allowed for instrumental separation and the distinct contribution of each instrument to the overall feel of the song. While the first two Stax singles failed to chart, the third, the Hayes/Porter composition (with similarities, including the title, to a gospel standard) \\"You Don't Know Like I Know\\" hit #7 R&B; in 1966. This was the first of 10 consecutive Top Twenty R&B; chart hits over three years, and 14 R&B; chart appearances during their career. =\\"Hold On, I'm Comin single and Hold On, I'm Comin' LP= \\"Hold On, I'm Comin' (R&B;#1/Pop#21), released in March 1966, was an enormous R&B; hit for Sam & Dave, and also their first single to break into the Top 40 Pop charts. The song was named the #1 song of the year for 1966 by the Billboard R&B; charts, and spent 20 weeks on the R&B; charts in 1966, peaking at #1 in June. In 1988, Rolling Stone named it one of the best 100 songs of the past 25 years. \\"Hold On, I'm Comin received a belated RIAA gold record for one million sales in 1995, 29 years after its release.Soulville Bowman pp 91‚Äì92 \\"Hold On, I'm Comin has since been recorded by dozens of other artists. \\"Hold On, I'm Comin was also the first recording on which Moore took lead on the first verse and Prater was given the response role and second verse at Hayes and Porter's suggestion. The duo used this format (singing dual leads) on most of their songs. The song was created when Hayes called to Porter, who was in the bathroom. Porter supposedly said \\"Hold on, man. I'm comin',\\" and Hayes and Porter wrote the song within 10 minutes. \\"Hold On, I'm Comin', when released, received objections from radio stations over the suggestive title. This resulted in a name change by Stewart and quick re-recording and re-release, and nearly all the original U.S. copies of the single bear the title \\"Hold On, I'm A-Comin'\\". The LP Hold On, I'm Comin' (4/66) reached #1 for 19 weeks on the R&B; album charts in 1966. After Sam & Dave's chart success, Roulette quickly released the album Sam & Dave in 1966 as well, a collection of the A & B sides of their six Roulette 45s, which did not chart. =When Something is Wrong, Double Dynamite LP and singles= Sam & Dave's next huge R&B; hit was \\"When Something is Wrong With My Baby,\\" their only ballad single, which was released in January 1967. Stax author Rob Bowman called this \\"One of the most sublime records in soul music's history,\\" and Mar-Keys trumpet player Wayne Jackson called it the greatest song he has ever heard. This was the only Sam & Dave hit where Dave sang the first verse solo; their other hits started with Sam & Dave together or Sam singing the first verse. \\"When Something is Wrong With My Baby\\" has since become an often recorded and performed duet for male and female singers performing together. The duo also charted in late 1966 with the top 10 R&B; hits \\"Said I Wasn't Gonna Tell Nobody,\\" and \\"You Got Me Hummin\\". These three singles, along with other tracks, were compiled on Double Dynamite (12/66), Sam & Dave's second LP on Stax. The LP peaked at #7 R&B; and #118 Pop. =\\"Soul Man\\" single and Soul Men LP= Sam & Dave's biggest hit and best-remembered song, \\"Soul Man\\" (R&B; #1/Pop #2), was released in August 1967. It was the number #1 song in the US according to Cashbox magazine Pop charts in November 1967. Sam & Dave won the Grammy Award in 1967 for \\"Best Performance ‚Äì Rhythm & Blues Group\\" for \\"Soul Man,\\" their first gold record. \\"Soul Man\\" was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. The song helped name the emerging music genre as \\"Soul Music\\". According to co-writer Isaac Hayes, the title was inspired by news reports of soul pride that emerged after the 1967 race riots, where stores that painting the word \\"soul\\" on your door was a message for looters to bypass your house. Hayes-Porter extrapolated that to \\"I'm a soul brother, I'm a soul man.\\". It has been recognized as one of the best or most influential songs of 50 years by the Grammy Hall of Fame, The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Rolling Stone, and R.I.A.A. Songs of the Century. \\"Soul Man\\" was used as the soundtrack and title for a 1986 film, a 2008 film Soul Men, a 1997‚Äì1998 television series. In 2019, \\"Soul Man\\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". The Soul Men LP (October 1967) was Sam & Dave's third Stax LP (R&B; #5/Pop #68).Billboard.com list of chart placements Musicologist Rob Bowman called Soul Men \\"One of the greatest soul music albums of all time.\\" \\"Don't Knock It\\" from the LP was released as a single in France, but other songs were not released as U.S. singles due to the long run by \\"Soul Man\\" on the Pop charts (15 weeks), by which time \\"I Thank You/Wrap It Up\\" was ready for release. \\"May I Baby,\\" the B-side of \\"Soul Man,\\" is also regarded as a classic song on the LP by Whitburn's \\"Top Pop Singles\\" guide, and was a popular live song performed frequently by Sam & Dave. =\\"I Thank You\\" single and I Thank You LP= In 1968, Sam & Dave again charted with the gospel-inspired \\"I Thank You/Wrap It Up\\" (R&B; #4/Pop #9). Critics commented that the B-side \\"Wrap It Up\\" could have been a separate successful single, which it later became for The Fabulous Thunderbirds. Because the duo were so busy touring, Hayes & Porter traveled to Europe to record the vocal track on \\"Wrap It Up\\" in order to release the single. Due to the end of the distribution agreement between Stax and Atlantic Records in May 1968, \\"I Thank You\\" was Sam & Dave's final single on Stax. Although they continued to work at Stax with Hayes/Porter, as of May 1968, the duo's work was released on Atlantic Records. \\"I Thank You\\" sold over one million copies, earning it gold record status. Sam & Dave's first 1968 single for Atlantic was \\"You Don't Know What You Mean to Me,\\" written by Eddie Floyd and Steve Cropper (R&B; #19/Pop #48). Sam & Dave said it was their favorite of their songs.Blitz magazine ‚Äì July 1978, p8 Sam & Dave also released \\"Can't You Find Another Way (of Doing It)\\" (#20 R&B;/#54 Pop), but it was not included in the I Thank You LP. Their final single of 1968, \\"Everybody Got to Believe in Somebody,\\" charted in the lower levels of the pop charts and ended Sam & Dave's streak at 10 straight R&B; top 20 singles. Though on Atlantic, the I Thank You LP (10/68) included 1968 singles initially on both Stax and Atlantic. The LP peaked at #38 on the R&B; charts, and was the only LP of their Stax recordings not to chart on the Pop LP charts.Soulsville, Bowman pp 138 =Sam & Dave's live performances= Sam & Dave's live act earned them the nickname \\"Double Dynamite.\\" Phil Walden, Otis Redding's manager, said \\"I think Sam & Dave will probably stand the test of time as being the best live act that there ever was. Those guys were absolutely unbelievable. Every night they were awesome.\\" An article from Time in October 1968 reads: \\"Of all the R&B; cats, nobody steams up a place like Sam & Dave ... weaving and dancing (while singing!), they gyrate through enough acrobatics to wear out more than 100 costumes per year.\\" Jerri Hershey described in Nowhere to Run: They carried red suits, white suits, three piece lime green suits, all with matching patent boots and coordinated silk hankies woefully inadequate to absorb a soul man's nightly outpourings. Both Sam & Dave talk a lot about sweat. To Dave, its proof that he's worked for his pay. For Sam its essential, almost mystical. He says he cannot work without it. \\"Unless my body reaches a certain temperature, starts to liquefy, I just don't feel right without it.\\" Wayne Jackson said Sam & Dave left puddles of sweat onstage by the end of a performance. In March 1967, Sam & Dave were co- headliners for the Stax/Volt Revue in Europe, which included Booker T & the MGs, The Mar-Keys, Eddie Floyd, Carla Thomas, Arthur Conley and headliner Otis Redding. It was the duo's first trip to Europe. Although Redding headlined the tour, many agreed Sam & Dave stole the show on many nights. According to Redding's and Sam & Dave's manager Phil Walden, Redding refused to be booked on the same bill with Sam & Dave again, not wanting to have to follow their explosive act. A live version of \\"Soothe Me\\" from Sam & Dave's Double Dynamite LP was recorded in Paris during the 1967 tour. Released as a single in mid-1967, it continued Sam & Dave's string of top 20 U.S. R&B; hits and was their first in the UK Top 40. After the tour, Sam & Dave worked as headliners in the U.S. and in Europe during Fall 1967, Fall 1968 and January 1970, and in Japan in 1969 and 1970. They averaged 280 shows per year from 1967 through 1969 and in 1967, they only took ten days off. Other high points included headlining the Montreal World's Fair in 1967, performing at the tribute to Martin Luther King, Jr. at Madison Square Garden in June 1968, being the first black soul act to headline the Fillmore East in December 1968, and headlining the Texas International Pop Festival for two nights in August 1969. Sam & Dave also performed on U.S. and European television, including two appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1969, appearing on The Tonight Show and American Bandstand in 1967, and performing on The Mike Douglas Show in 1969 and 1970. Moore frequently recalls the performances on The Ed Sullivan Show as a career highlight. The Atlantic Records years (1968‚Äì1972)=Best of LP, Stax- recorded singles (1969)= The year 1969 started well, with the Atlantic release of The Best of Sam & Dave LP in January. It contained all of their Stax A sides except \\"A Place Nobody Can Find\\" and several B-sides, and peaked at #24 on the R&B; LP charts and #89 on the Billboard LP charts.Billboard Charts Online Their first single of the year, \\"Soul Sister, Brown Sugar,\\" returned Sam & Dave to the R&B; top 20, and was a #15 hit in the UK.database of UK chart singles:www.everyhit.com The follow-up \\"Born Again,\\" reached the lower levels of the charts, and was the last single Sam & Dave recorded at Stax. =Atlantic produced records, first break-up, and reunion (1969‚Äì1972)= Jerry Wexler with co-producer Tom Dowd tried producing Sam & Dave in New York, with Atlantic songwriters and musicians. It took eight months to issue \\"Ooh, Ooh, Ooh\\", the first Atlantic single in August 1969. It was not a very good record, by Sam's own admission, and it represented the first time in four years that a Sam & Dave single failed to chart. Two more singles followed in 1970, \\"Baby, Baby, Don't Stop Now,\\" and \\"One Part Love, Two Parts Pain.\\" The first was a leftover Hayes-Porter recording from Stax; the second was produced by Wexler and Dowd in New York, and was written by Stax executive Al Bell and Allen Jones. Both failed to chart. According to Wexler, \\"We just made some shit-ass records with them. I never really got into their sensibilities as a producer.\\"Soulsville, Bowman pp 140 Wexler then sent the duo south to Muscle Shoals and Miami to work with producers Brad Shapiro and Dave Crawford for their next single \\"Knock It Out The Park,\\" which also failed to chart. Sam & Dave split in June 1970, according to MooreInterview with Blues and Soul magazine (July 17‚Äì30, 1970) and later interviews as a result of Moore's dissatisfaction with the duo and his desire to pursue a career solo. According to Prater, they broke up because \\"[Moore] decided to do what he wanted to do on his own.\\" Moore recorded three solo singles (none of which charted) for Atlantic over the next year and was preparing an album produced by King Curtis, which was shelved after Curtis was stabbed to death in 1971. Prater recorded a single for Alston. Neither was commercially successful as a solo act, and they reunited in August 1971. In October 1971, their last Atlantic single, \\"Don't Pull Your Love,\\" was a cover of a hit by Hamilton, Joe Frank & Reynolds. This Shapiro/Crawford production was a minor hit (R&B; #36/Pop #102), but not a substantial enough commercial success to keep the duo signed to the label. Sam & Dave recorded four final songs for Atlantic in August, 1972, none of which was released by the label. Their contract with Atlantic expired shortly thereafter. Later years (1972‚Äì1981) Despite inability to attract a major label after Atlantic, there was still demand for public performances, especially in Europe.Blues and Soul August 6‚Äì19, 1971 p.6 They toured Turkey in Spring, 1972 and England in Spring, 1973. Sam & Dave also continued to be visible in the U.S., performing on TV shows including The Midnight Special and The Mike Douglas Show. According to Sam, most U.S. shows in the 1970s were small clubs, oldies shows, and whatever they could get. He attributed their poor bookings during this period to rumors of drug use and bad blood between the duo. Sam & Dave returned to the studio in 1974 and 1975, recording an album of new songs titled Back at Cha for United Artists. The album ‚Äì their first album of new material in 7 years ‚Äì was produced by Steve Cropper, and featured the MGs and The Memphis Horns and had a minor R&B; single, \\"A Little Bit of Good\\" (R&B; #89). Songwriters included Cropper, Allen Toussaint, and Jimmy Cliff.All Music Guide To Soul ed Boganov/Bush/Woodstra/Erlewine 2003 Backbeat Books p.58 Although the LP received positive reviews, it failed to chart. In a side project, they provided vocals on \\"Come On, Come Over\\" for Jaco Pastorius for his debut album on Epic in 1976. In 1976‚Äì77, Sam & Dave recorded songs in the UK with producer John Abbey. Two singles were released on Abbey's Contempo label in the UK and Germany, with limited success. Ironically, given the duo's disputes, one of the last singles by Sam & Dave was a cover of The Beatles \\"We Can Work It Out.\\" Sam & Dave also briefly retired in 1977, with Dave working at a Pontiac dealership in New Jersey and Sam working at an Austin, Texas, law firm as a process server. In 1978, Sam & Dave re-recorded old hits for the LP Sweet & Funky Gold (Gusto), and re-recorded songs and other soul hits during this period in Nashville for an album for K-Tel Records, The Original Soul Man.Sam & Dave ‚Äì An Oral History p.130 In Summer, 1978, they toured Germany for two weeks. In 1979, Sam & Dave enjoyed a significant resurgence of interest as a result of Dan Aykroyd's and John Belushi's sketch characters The Blues Brothers, and the comic actors' 1979 top 40 cover of \\"Soul Man.\\" Moore stated they were offered an opportunity to perform onstage with Belushi and Aykroyd on SNL but turned it down when Belushi said Sam & Dave had to perform the intro, then the Blues Brothers would take over. According to an April 1988 interview with Aykroyd in the Chicago Sun-Times, Aykroyd saw Sam & Dave as a teenager at the Montreal Expo in 1967 and said they were one of his biggest influences for creating The Blues Brothers. Aykroyd convinced director John Landis to include the Jake and Elwood Blues characters listening to \\"Hold On, I'm Comin and \\"Soothe Me\\" while riding in the Bluesmobile in the 1980 film The Blues Brothers as a tribute to Sam & Dave. Also in 1979, Sam & Dave opened shows for The Clash on their U.S. tour, including at the Palladium in New York City. In 1980, the duo performed in Paul Simon's film One Trick Pony and, finally, on Saturday Night Live. In 1980, they also were featured in a U.S. tour opening for the 1950s revival band Sha Na Na. In 1981, they re-recorded many hits along with Sam Cooke and Otis Redding covers for LPs titled Soul Study Vol. 1 and Soul Study Vol. 2 (Odyssey). The pair last performed on New Year's Eve, 1981, at the Old Waldorf in San Francisco. According to Moore, when they walked off stage it was the last time they spoke to each other.Sam & Dave ‚Äì An Oral History p.118 Dave Prater and Sam Daniels (1982‚Äì1988) In 1982, Prater started touring under the \\"Sam & Dave\\" name or as \\"The New Sam & Dave Revue\\" with Sam Daniels, who performed with Dave from October 1982 until Dave's death in 1988. Moore attempted to block Prater from using the group's name,San Diego Union Tribune 9/25/85 \\"Singer Finds Sour Note in New Duo's Name\\" PP B1 but was largely unsuccessful. The Daniels & Prater incarnation played 100 shows per year over the next seven years, including in Europe, Japan and Canada. In 1983, Sam & Dave called on J.C. \\"Billy\\" Davis to put together a band to back them at a concert at Pine Knob, in Clarkston, Michigan where they were opening for James Brown.Date: 08/13/1983, Venue: Pine Knob Music Theater, Featured Artist(s): James Brown, Bo Diddley, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Sam & Dave at theconcertdatabase In 1985, Prater and Sam Daniels released a newly sung medley of Sam & Dave hits recorded in The Netherlands, which peaked at #92 on the R&B; chart and was credited to \\"Sam & Dave\\". Sam Moore got the record company to recall the single for using the \\"Sam & Dave\\" name without permission, and the record was re-labelled and re- issued by \\"The New Sam & Dave Revue\\".Congressional Testimony 5/21/1998 \\"Protection Against Artistic Knock-Off's:Sam Moore\\" Prater last performed with Sam Daniels on April 3, 1988 at a Stax Reunion at the Atlanta Civic Center, which also featured Isaac Hayes, Eddie Floyd, and Rufus and Carla Thomas. Six days later, on April 9, 1988, Prater died in a car crash in Sycamore, Georgia while driving to his mother's house. Sam Moore solo career (1982‚Äìpresent) Moore has continued to perform and record as a solo artist, and has also performed in numerous duets with other popular artists. (See the Sam Moore article.) Conflict between Moore and Prater Sam & Dave were also famous for having a very tumultuous partnership during most of their 21 years together. According to Moore, they did not speak to each other offstage for almost 13 years. During the 1970s, they broke up many times, and typically would show up separately for shows, require separate dressing rooms, not look at each other onstage, and communicate through intermediaries.Jeri Hirshey from book Nowhere to Run They also had performances in the 1970s where only one of them would show up. Moore describes personal issues with Prater, drug use, touring fatigue, and a desire to do his own act with new material as contributing to their break-up. Prater attributed their rift and break-ups to Moore's frustrations in wanting to do his own act and diversify from repeatedly performing the Sam & Dave song catalog (which Prater has said that Moore didn't like very much). Covers by other artists/use in pop culture Sam & Dave songs have been recorded by other artists, including 29 covers of \\"Hold On, I'm Comin'.\\" Others who charted with Sam & Dave songs include ZZ Top -\\"I Thank You,\\" The Fabulous Thunderbirds -\\"Wrap It Up,\\" James & Bobby Purify -\\"I Take What I Want,\\" Linda Ronstadt featuring Aaron Neville -\\"When Something Is Wrong with My Baby,\\" Chuck Jackson & Maxine Brown -\\"Hold On, I'm Comin',\\" Elvis Costello ‚Äì \\"I Can't Stand Up for Falling Down\\" and Lydia Pense & Cold Blood -\\"I Take What I Want.\\" A diverse group of other successful artists also recorded Sam & Dave covers including: Aretha Franklin, Peter Frampton, The Temptations, Bonnie Raitt, Jackie Wilson, Eurythmics, Rory Gallagher, Tom Jones, The Band, Martha Reeves & the Vandellas, Michael Bolton, Patti LaBelle & Travis Tritt, Bryan Ferry, Marilyn McCoo & Billy Davis Jr., The Hollies, Paul Butterfield, Taj Mahal (musician), Guy Sebastian, and Eric Clapton & B.B. King. In 2003, the Stax Museum of American Soul Music opened in Memphis, and Sam & Dave are in the film made for the museum, titled Soulsville, and they have a permanent wall-and-video display. Barack Obama used \\"Hold On, I'm Comin as a theme song on the campaign trail until Sam Moore requested that he stop using it. Eleven months later, Sam Moore performed \\"Soul Man\\" with Sting and Elvis Costello at one of Obama's inaugural parties. A parody of \\"Soul Man\\" created by Moore, \\"I'm a Dole Man,\\" was used in the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign until the copyright owners objected and requested the campaign stop using it. Sam & Dave released the rare single \\"Hold On, Edwin's Coming\\" in 1982 to support Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards' third run for governor. Another parody, \\"I'm a Suns Fan,\\" was recorded by Moore and used for the Phoenix Suns basketball games. Sam & Dave songs have been used frequently in movie and TV soundtracks and commercials, including \\"Hold On, I'm Comin on the soundtrack of the 2007 hit film American Gangster. \\"Hold On, I'm Comin and \\"Soothe Me\\" played on the radio and 8 track player (album titled: \\"The Best of Sam & Dave\\") in the Bluesmobile during the 1980 hit movie The Blues Brothers. \\"A Place Nobody Can Find\\" was used in the background of a scene in HBO's series The Wire. Jay Leno used \\"Hold On, I'm Comin\\" while driving his AC Cobra on his 2009 Super Bowl commercial to announce his show's move to a new time. \\"Wrap It Up\\" was used as a transition to commercial break for The O'Reilly Factor. \\"Soul Man\\" was used as the title and title track in the 1986 movie featuring C. Thomas Howell, and also the 1997‚Äì1998 television series featuring Dan Aykroyd. The movie Tapeheads, released in 1988 and starring John Cusack and Tim Robbins, featured Sam Moore and Junior Walker as a fictitious, legendary soul duo called The Swanky Modes. The movie Soul Men, released in November 2008, was a comedy featuring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson as two feuding soul singers called \\"The Real Deal.\\" In February 2009, Moore filed suit against the film production company (The Weinstein Company) and the producers for infringing on the marks \\"Soul Man\\" and \\"Soul Men,\\" claiming the movie is based on the careers of Sam & Dave, and damaged both Moore's reputation and career. The suit was dismissed on summary judgment in May 2012.

The bedroom farce is perhaps the most common form of farce. Overview The most famous bedroom farceur is probably Georges Feydeau, whose collections of coincidences, slamming doors, and ridiculous dialogue delighted Paris in the 1890s and are now considered forerunners to the Theatre of the Absurd. The Viennese playwright Arthur Schnitzler took bedroom farce to its highest dramatic level in his La Ronde, which in ten bedroom scenes connect the highest and lowest of Vienna. Some of the English Aldwych farces by Ben Travers which were popular in the 1920s and 1930s have aspects of \\"bedroom farce\\", e.g. A Cuckoo in the Nest or Rookery Nook. However, in each case the sharing of a bedroom or house turns out to have an innocent explanation. In modern times, Woody Allen's A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy (1982) presents aspects of the bedroom farce. Michael Frayn's 1977 play Donkeys' Years is a classic bedroom farce; Frayn parodied the genre in his 1982 play Noises Off via its play-within-the-play, \\"Nothing On.\\" Alan Ayckbourn's play, entitled Bedroom Farce, looks at the lives of three couples seen in their own bedrooms, the stage being split into three sets for this purpose. There is much humour in the play, although few if any of the usual conventions of farce are observed. Boeing Boeing is a classic French farce for the stage by Marc Camoletti. Utilizing most of the conventions of bedroom farce's canon, it concerns a Parisian bachelor playboy with three international air stewardess fianc√©es he secretly keeps in careful rotation, until their flight schedules change and he, along with his provincial friend and sassy maid, must keep them from finding out about each other. Luckily they have enough doors in the apartment to keep the girls unwittingly flitting about for two hours. American three-camera situation comedy, an extension of proscenium stage tradition, often includes elements of farce, specifically in several episodes of Three's Company, the \\"Woody's Wedding\\" episode of Cheers, \\"The Ski Lodge\\" episode of Frasier, and the \\"Love Car Displacement\\" episode of The Big Bang Theory. Brian Rix performed many bedroom farces at the Garrick theatre in London, many of which were broadcast by the BBC. British dramatist Ray Cooney, whose Run For Your Wife was the longest running comedy in West End theater history, is a modern master of this genre.

The group was composed of five boys, all in their early to mid-teens. The original lineup of the Teenagers, an integrated group, included three African-American members, Frankie Lymon, Jimmy Merchant, and Sherman Garnes; and two Puerto Rican members, Joe Negroni and Herman Santiago. The Teenagers' first single, 1956's \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\\" was also their biggest hit. After Lymon went solo in mid-1957, both his career and that of the Teenagers fell into decline. He was found dead at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom from a heroin overdose. His life was dramatized in the 1998 film Why Do Fools Fall In Love. Biography=1942‚Äì56: Early life/Joining the Teenagers= Frankie Lymon (center) and the Teenagers Lymon was born in Harlem, New York on September 30, 1942 to Jeanette and Howard Lymon. Howard was a truck driver and Jeanette was a maid. Both also sang in the gospel group The Harlemaires; Frankie and his brothers Lewis and Howie sang with the Harlemaire Juniors (a fourth brother, Timmy, was a singer, though not with the Harlemaire Juniors). The Lymons struggled to make ends meet, so Lymon began working as a grocery boy at age 10. At 12 in 1954, Lymon heard a local doo-wop group known as the Coupe De Villes at a school talent show. He became friends with the lead singer, Herman Santiago, and he eventually became a member of the group, now calling itself both The Ermines and The Premiers. Dennis Jackson of Columbus, Georgia, was one of the main influences in Lymon's life. His personal donation of $500 helped start Lymon's career. One day in 1955, a neighbor gave The Premiers several love letters that had been written to him by his girlfriend, hoping to give the boys inspiration to write their own songs. Merchant and Santiago adapted one of the letters into a song called \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". The Premiers, now calling themselves The Teenagers, got their first shot at fame after impressing Richard Barrett, a singer with The Valentines. Barrett, in turn, got the group an audition with record producer George Goldner. On the day of the group's audition, original lead singer Santiago was late. Lymon stepped up and told Goldner that he knew the part because he helped write the song. The disc jockeys always called them \\"Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers\\". =1956: \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" success= Goldner signed the group to Gee Records, and \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" became its first single in January 1956. The single peaked at No. 6 on the Billboard pop singles chart, and topped the Billboard R&B; singles chart for five weeks. Six other top 10 blues singles followed over the next year or so: \\"I Want You to Be My Girl\\", \\"I Promise to Remember\\", \\"Who Can Explain?\\", \\"Out in the Cold Again\\", \\"The ABC's of Love\\", \\"I'm Not a Juvenile Delinquent\\", and \\"Baby Baby\\" were also popular Teenagers releases. \\"I Want You To Be My Girl\\" gave the band its second pop hit, reaching No. 13 on the national Billboard Hot 100 chart. \\"Goody Goody\\" (written by Matty Malneck and Johnny Mercer and originally performed by Benny Goodman) was a No. 20 pop hit but did not appear on the R&B; chart. The Teenagers placed two other singles in the lower half of the pop chart. With the release of \\"I Want You To Be My Girl\\", the group's second single, The Teenagers became Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers. An album, \\"The Teenagers Featuring Frankie Lymon\\", was released in December 1956. =1957‚Äì65: Solo career= In early 1957, Lymon and the Teenagers broke up while on a tour in Europe. During an engagement at the London Palladium, Goldner began pushing Lymon as a solo act, giving him solo spots in the show. Lymon began performing with backing from pre-recorded tapes. The group's last single, \\"Goody Goody\\" backed with \\"Creation of Love,\\" initially retained the \\"Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers\\" credit, but they were actually solo recordings (with backing by session singers). Lymon had officially departed from the group by September 1957; an in-progress studio album called Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers at the London Palladium was instead issued as a Lymon solo release. As a solo artist, Lymon was not nearly as successful as he had been with the Teenagers. Beginning with his second solo release, \\"My Girl\\", Lymon had moved to Roulette Records. On a July 19, 1957 episode of Alan Freed's live ABC TV show The Big Beat, Lymon began dancing with a white teenage girl while he was performing. His actions caused a scandal, particularly among Southern TV station owners, and The Big Beat was subsequently canceled. There is no surviving footage because the episode was taped over, according to Judith Fisher Freed.Quebec, Michael (May 2002). \\"Alan Freed\\". Retrieved May 13, 2020. Lymon's slowly declining sales fell sharply in the early 1960s. His highest-charting solo hit was a cover of Bobby Day's \\"Little Bitty Pretty One\\", which peaked at No. 58 on the Hot 100 pop chart in 1960 and which had been recorded in 1957. Addicted to heroin since the age of 15, Lymon fell further into his habit, and his performing career went into decline. According to Lymon in an interview with Ebony magazine in 1967, he was first introduced to heroin when he was 15 by a woman twice his age. In 1961, Roulette, now run by Morris Levy, ended their contract with Lymon and he entered a drug rehabilitation program. After losing Lymon, the Teenagers went through a string of replacement singers, the first of whom was Billy Lobrano. In 1960, Howard Kenny Bobo sang lead on \\"Tonight's the Night\\" with the Teenagers; later that year, Johnny Houston sang lead on two songs. The Teenagers, who had been moved by Morris Levy to End Records, were released from their contract in 1961. The Teenagers briefly reunited with Lymon in 1965, without success. =1966‚Äì68: Later years= Over the next four years, Lymon struggled through short-lived deals with 20th Century Fox Records and Columbia Records. He began a relationship with Elizabeth Mickey Waters, who became his first wife in January 1964 and gave birth to his only child, Francine, who died two days after birth at Lenox Hill Hospital. Lymon's marriage to Waters was not legal because she was still married to her first husband at the time. After the marriage failed, he moved to Los Angeles in the mid-1960s, where he began a romantic relationship with Zola Taylor, a member of the Platters. Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965 although their relationship ended several months later, purportedly because of Lymon's drug habits. Lymon, however, had been known to say that their marriage was a publicity stunt, and Taylor could produce no legal documentation of their marriage. In Major Robinson's gossip column of June 6, 1966, Zola said the whole thing was a joke that she went along with at the time (October 1965).Robinson, Major (June 6, 1966) The Pittsburgh Courier He appeared at the Apollo as part of a revue, adding an extended tap dance number. Lymon recorded several live performances (such as \\"Melinda\\" in 1959), but none rose on the charts. His final television performance was on Hollywood A Go-Go in 1965, where the then-22-or-23-year-old singer lip-synched to the recording of his 13-year-old self singing \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love.\\" On June 21, 1966, he was arrested on a heroin charge and was drafted into the United States Army in the lieu of a jail sentence. He reported to Fort Gordon, Georgia, near Augusta, Georgia, for training. While in the Augusta area, Lymon met and fell in love with Emira Eagle, a schoolteacher at Hornsby Elementary in Augusta. The two were wed in June 1967, and Lymon repeatedly went AWOL to secure gigs at small Southern clubs. Dishonorably discharged from the Army, Lymon moved into his wife's home and continued to perform sporadically. Traveling to New York in 1968, Lymon was signed by manager Sam Bray to his Big Apple label, and the singer returned to recording. Roulette Records expressed interest in releasing Lymon's records in conjunction with Big Apple and scheduled a recording session for February 28. A major promotion had been arranged with CHO Associates, owned by radio personalities Frankie Crocker, Herb Hamlett and Eddie O'Jay. Lymon, staying at his grandmother's house in Harlem where he had grown up, celebrated his good fortune by taking heroin; he had remained clean ever since entering the Army three years earlier. Death On February 27, 1968, Lymon was found dead of a heroin overdose at the age of 25 on the floor of his grandmother's bathroom with a syringe by his side. Lymon, a Baptist, was buried at Catholic Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Throggs Neck section of The Bronx, New York City, New York. \\"I'm Sorry\\" and \\"Seabreeze\\", the two songs Lymon had recorded for Big Apple before his death, were released later in 1968. Posthumous troubles Lymon's troubles extended to others after his death. After Diana Ross returned \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" to the Top Ten in 1981, a major controversy concerning Lymon's estate ensued. Zola Taylor, Elizabeth Waters and Emira Eagle each approached Morris Levy, the music impresario who retained possession of Lymon's copyrights and his royalties, claiming to be Lymon's rightful widow; Lymon had neglected to divorce any of them. The complex issue resulted in lawsuits and counter-lawsuits, and in 1986 the first of several court cases concerning the ownership of Lymon's estate began. Trying to determine who was indeed the lawful Mrs. Frankie Lymon was complicated by more issues. Waters was already married when she married Lymon; she had separated from her first husband, but their divorce was finalized in 1965, after she had married Lymon.Goldberg, Marv. \\"Marv Goldberg's R&B; Notebook: The Teenagers\\". Taylor claimed to have married Lymon in Mexico in 1965, but could produce no acceptable evidence of their union. Lymon's marriage to Eagle, on the other hand, was properly documented as having taken place at Beulah Grove Baptist Church in Augusta, Georgia, in 1967; however, the singer was still apparently twice-married and never divorced when he married Eagle. The first decision was made in Waters' favor; Eagle appealed, and in 1989, the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed the original decision and awarded Lymon's estate to Eagle.Matter of Lymon, 151 A.D.2d 248 (1989)Bennett, Joy. The Real Story of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". The 1998 Frankie Lymon biographical film concludes with a comical post-script stating that Elmira Eagle (now legally Elmira Eagle-Lymon) received only $15,000 from winning Lymon's estate, after legal and other expenses were paid off. An excerpt from this article states otherwise: \\"A major discrepancy in the movie left the impression that [Elmira Eagle-Lymon] only received a $15,000 settlement. After Diana Ross re-recorded Frankie's song \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love,\\" his estate was worth more than $1 million. Attorney [William] McCracken confirms that 'the settlement was well over seven figures.'\\" However, the details of the case brought about another issue: whether mobster Morris Levy was deserving of the songwriting co-credit on \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". Although early single releases of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" credit Frankie Lymon, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant as co- writers, later releases and cover versions were attributed to Lymon and George Goldner. When Goldner sold his music companies to Morris Levy in 1959, Levy's name began appearing as co-writer of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" in place of Goldner's. Lymon was never paid his songwriting royalties during his lifetime; one result of Emira Eagle's legal victory was that Lymon's estate would finally begin receiving monetary compensation from his hit song's success. In 1987, Herman Santiago and Jimmy Merchant, both by then poor, sued Morris Levy for their songwriting credits. In December 1992, the United States federal courts ruled that Santiago and Merchant were co-authors of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\". However, in 1996 the ruling was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit on the basis of the statute of limitations: copyright cases must be brought before a court within three years of the alleged civil violation, and Merchant and Santiago's lawsuit was not filed until 30 years later. Authorship of \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" currently remains in the names of Frankie Lymon and Morris Levy.Jimmy Merchant and Herman Santiago v. Morris Levy, Big Seven Music Corp, and Roulette Records, Inc. Appeal decided August 7, 1996. Legacy Although their period of success was brief, Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers' string of hits were highly influential on the rock and R&B; performers who followed them. Lymon's high-voiced sound is said to be a direct predecessor of the girl group sound, and the list of performers who name him as an influence include Michael Jackson, Ronnie Spector, Diana Ross, The Chantels, The Temptations, George Clinton, Smokey Robinson, Len Barry, The Beach Boys and Billy Joel, among others.Williams, Otis and Romanowski, Patricia (1988, 2002). Temptations [2nd edition]. New York: Cooper Square Press. Pg. 120-21. The performers most inspired by and derivative of Lymon and the Teenagers' style are The Jackson 5 and their lead singer and future superstar Michael Jackson. Motown founder Berry Gordy based much of the Jackson 5's sound on Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers' recordings, and the Teenagers are believed to be the original model for many of the other Motown groups he cultivated.Fotenot, Robert. \\"Profile: Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers.\\" In 1973, Lymon became known to a slightly younger generation than before with the release of American Graffiti, which included \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\" on its soundtrack. In September 1979 at the Santa Barbara Bowl, Joni Mitchell performed a version of \\"Why Do Fools Fall In Love\\" which subsequently appeared on the release of her album of the concert entitled \\"Shadows and Light\\" the following September. During the opening mix of the album, Joni Mitchell also spliced sections of \\"I'm Not A Juvenile Delinquent\\" into the title track refrains. The Fall referenced him in \\"No X-mas for John Quays\\" on their March 1979 album \\"Live at the Witch Trials.\\" The English band Everything but the Girl on their 1991 album Worldwide include the song \\"Boxing and Pop Music\\" which references Lymon throughout the song. Lymon was mentioned in the 1992 Stephen King short story \\"You Know They Got a Hell of a Band\\". Lymon is named as the one who cut off the waitress Sissy's finger for trying to help the protagonists, Mary and Clark Willingham, escape from the town of Rock & Roll Heaven, Oregon, which is inhabited by Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Roy Orbison, and other musicians who died young. In 1993, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2000. Lymon's music and story were eventually re- introduced to modern audiences with Why Do Fools Fall in Love, a 1998 biographical film directed by Gregory Nava, also the director of the Selena biopic. Why Do Fools Fall in Love tells a comedic, fictionalized version of Lymon's story from the points of view of his three wives as they battle in court for the rights to his estate. The film stars Larenz Tate as Frankie Lymon, Halle Berry as Zola Taylor, Vivica A. Fox as Elizabeth Waters and Lela Rochon as Emira Eagle.

Active from 1966 to 1983, it was pivotal in the development of funk, soul, rock, and psychedelic music. Its core line-up was led by singer-songwriter, record producer, and multi-instrumentalist Sly Stone, and included Stone's brother and singer/guitarist Freddie Stone, sister and singer/keyboardist Rose Stone, trumpeter Cynthia Robinson, drummer Greg Errico, saxophonist Jerry Martini, and bassist Larry Graham. It was the first major American rock group to have a racially integrated, male and female lineup. Formed in 1966, the group's music synthesized a variety of disparate musical genres to help pioneer the emerging \\"psychedelic soul\\" sound. They released a series of Top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits such as \\"Dance to the Music\\" (1968), \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), and \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" (1969), as well as critically acclaimed albums such as Stand! (1969), which combined pop sensibility with social commentary. In the 1970s, it transitioned into a darker and less commercial funk sound on releases such as There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Fresh (1973), proving as influential as their early work. By 1975, drug problems and interpersonal clashes led to dissolution,Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. xi‚Äìxix. though Sly continued to record and tour with a new rotating lineup under the name \\"Sly and the Family Stone\\" until drug problems forced his effective retirement in 1987. The work of Sly and the Family Stone greatly influenced the sound of subsequent American funk, pop, soul, R&B;, and hip hop music. Music critic Joel Selvin wrote, \\"there are two types of black music: black music before Sly Stone, and black music after Sly Stone\\".Selvin, Joel (1998), p. xi. In 2010, they were ranked 43rd in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time, and three of their albums are included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.  Career  Sylvester Stewart was born into the Dallas, Texas, family of K.C. and Alpha Stewart, followers of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) who encouraged musical expression in the household.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 1‚Äì4. After the Stewarts moved to Vallejo, California, the youngest four children (Sylvester, Freddie, Rose, and Vaetta) formed \\"The Stewart Four\\", who released a local 78 RPM single, \\"On the Battlefield of the Lord\\" b/w \\"Walking in Jesus' Name\\", in 1952. While attending high school, Sylvester and Freddie joined student bands. One of Sylvester's high school musical groups was a doo-wop act called The Viscaynes. The Viscaynes released a few local singles, and Sylvester recorded several solo singles under the name \\"Danny Stewart\\". By 1964, Sylvester had become Sly Stone and a disc jockey for San Mateo, California located R&B; radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a record producer for Autumn Records, producing for San Francisco-area bands such as The Beau Brummels and The Mojo Men. One of the Sylvester Stewart-produced Autumn singles, Bobby Freeman's \\"C'mon and Swim\\", was a national hit.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 12. Stewart recorded unsuccessful solo singles while at Autumn.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 8‚Äì9. = Early years = In 1966, Sly Stone formed a band called Sly & the Stoners, which included acquaintance Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. Around the same time, Freddie founded a band called Freddie & the Stone Souls, which included Gregg Errico on drums, and Ronnie Crawford on saxophone. At the suggestion of Stone's friend, saxophonist Jerry Martini, Sly and Freddie combined their bands, creating Sly and the Family Stone in November 1966. At first the group was called Sly Brothers and Sisters but after their first gig at the Winchester Cathedral, a night club in Redwood City, California, they changed the name to Sly & the Family Stone. Since both Sly and Freddie were guitarists, Sly appointed Freddie the official guitarist for the Family Stone, and taught himself to play the electronic organ. Sly also recruited Larry Graham to play bass guitar. Vanetta Stewart wanted to join the band as well. She and her friends, Mary McCreary and Elva Mouton, had a gospel group called The Heavenly Tones. Sly recruited the teenagers directly out of high school to become Little Sister, Sly and the Family Stone's background vocalists.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 88; interview with Elva \\"Tiny\\" Moulton. After a gig at the Winchester Cathedral, CBS Records executive David Kapralik signed the group to CBS's Epic Records label. The Family Stone's first album, A Whole New Thing, was released in 1967 to critical acclaim, particularly from musicians such as Mose Allison and Tony Bennett.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 59‚Äì60; interviews with David Kapralik and Jerry Martini. However, the album's low sales restricted their playing venues to small clubs, and caused Clive Davis and the record label to intervene.Fotenot, Robert. Profile: Sly and the Family Stone . About.com.

Upon its February 1968 release, \\"Dance to the Music\\" became a widespread ground- breaking hit, and was the band's first charting single, reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. Just before the release of \\"Dance to the Music\\", Rose Stone joined the group as a vocalist and a keyboardist. Rose's brothers had invited her to join the band from the beginning, but she initially had been reluctant to leave her steady job at a local record store. The Dance to the Music album went on to decent sales, but the follow-up, Life, was not as successful commercially.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas . [ Review for Life by Sly and the Family Stone]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on January 17, 2007. In September 1968, the band embarked on its first overseas tour, to England.

With its B-side \\"Sing a Simple Song\\", it served as the lead single for the band's fourth album, Stand!, which was released on May 3, 1969. The Stand! album eventually sold more than three million copies; its title track peaked at No. 22 in the U.S. Stand! is considered one of the artistic high points of the band's career. It contained the above three tracks as well as the songs \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\" (which was the B-side of the \\"Stand!\\" single), \\"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\\", \\"Sex Machine\\", and \\"You Can Make It If You Try\\". The success of Stand! secured Sly and the Family Stone a performance slot at the landmark Woodstock Music and Art Festival. They performed their set during the early-morning hours of August 17, 1969; their performance was said to be one of the best shows of the festival. A new non- album single, \\"Hot Fun in the Summertime\\", was released the same month and went to No. 2 on the U.S. pop chart (peaking in October, after the summer of 1969 had already ended). In 1970, following the release of the Woodstock documentary, the single of \\"Stand!\\" and \\"I Want to Take You Higher\\" was reissued with the latter song now the A-side; it reached the Top 40. The band previewed their Woodstock performance three weeks earlier, when they headlined the Harlem Cultural Festival, frequently dubbed, \\"The Black Woodstock,\\" before tens of thousands of spectators in Mount Morris Park. The full-length television program for which it was filmed never aired. = Internal problems and a change of direction = With the band's new-found fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146‚Äì152. Epic requested more marketable output.Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 24‚Äì25. The Black Panther Party demanded that Sly replace Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists and fire manager David Kapralik.Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 85.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 89; interview with David Kapralik. After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Sly Stone and his fellow band members became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and PCP.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94‚Äì98. As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Sly Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122. recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" / \\"Everybody Is a Star\\", released in December 1969. \\"Thank You\\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. During 1970, Sly Stone spent most of his waking hours on drugs.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 113‚Äì115. He became erratic and moody, and missed nearly a third of the band's concerts that year. The band did close out the Strawberry Fields Festival near Toronto, Ontario in August but live appearances on television talk shows such as The Mike Douglas Show and The Dick Cavett Show went unpredictably.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 120‚Äì122. Meanwhile, Sly hired his streetwise cohorts, Hamp \\"Bubba\\" Banks and J.B. Brown, as his personal managers; they in turn brought in gangsters such as Edward \\"Eddie Chin\\" Elliott and Mafioso J.R. Valtrano to be Sly's bodyguards. Sly enlisted these individuals to handle his business dealings, to retrieve drugs, and to protect him from those he considered his enemies, some of whom were his own bandmates and staff.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 99‚Äì100, 150‚Äì152. A rift developed between Sly and the rest of the band;Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 146‚Äì147. in early 1971, drummer Errico became the first to leave the band for other ventures. He was replaced with a succession of drummers until Sly settled on Gerry Gibson, who only remained with the band for a year before being replaced by Andy Newmark in 1973. To appease fan demand for new songs, Epic began re-releasing material. A Whole New Thing was reissued with a new cover, and several of the Family Stone's most popular recordings were packaged into the band's first Greatest Hits album. Greatest Hits reached number two on the Billboard 200 in 1970. During this period, Sly Stone negotiated a production deal with Atlantic Records, resulting in his own imprint, Stone Flower Productions. Stone Flower released four singles, including one by R&B; artist Joe Hicks, one by a group called 6IX, and two pop Top 40/R&B; Top 10 singles by Little Sister: \\"You're the One\\" and \\"Somebody's Watching You\\", a cover of a song from Stand!. For unclear reasons, Sly gradually withdrew his attention from Stone Flower, and the label was closed in 1971. Little Sister's \\"Somebody's Watching You\\" is the first popular recording to feature the use of a drum machine for its rhythm track.Lewis, Miles (2006), p. 74. = There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) = In 1971, Sly and the Family Stone returned with a new single, \\"Family Affair\\", which became a number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Family Affair\\" was the lead single from the band's long-awaited There's a Riot Goin' On. Instead of the optimistic, rock-laced soul that had characterized the Family Stone's 1960s output, There's a Riot Goin' On was urban blues, filled with dark instrumentation, filtered drum machine tracks, and plaintive vocals representing the hopelessness Sly and many other people were feeling in the early 1970s.Lewis, Miles (2006), pp. 74‚Äì75. The album is characterized by a significant amount of tape hiss ‚Äì the result of Sly's extensive re-recording and overdubbing during production.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 115‚Äì117. Allegedly, most of the album's instrumentation is performed by Sly alone, who enlisted the Family Stone for some of the additional instrumental parts and friends such as Billy Preston, Ike Turner, and Bobby Womack for others.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 115; interview with Stephen Paley. \\"(You Caught Me) Smilin'\\" and \\"Runnin' Away\\" were also released as singles, and performed well on the charts. After the release of Riot, additional lineup changes took place. In early 1972, reacting to Jerry Martini's probing about his share of the band's earnings, Sly hired saxophonist Pat Rizzo as a potential replacementSelvin, Joel (1998), p. 134. though both ended up remaining in the band. Later that year, the tension between Sly Stone and Larry Graham reached its peak. A post- concert brawl broke out between the Graham and Sly entourages; Bubba Banks and Eddie Chin, having heard that Larry had hired a hit man to kill Sly, assaulted Graham's associates.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 150‚Äì154. Graham and his wife climbed out of a hotel window to escape, and Pat Rizzo gave them a ride to safety. Unable to continue working with Sly, Graham immediately quit the Family Stone and went on to start Graham Central Station, a successful band in the same vein as Sly and the Family Stone. Graham was replaced in the interim by Bobby Womack, and then by nineteen-year-old Rusty Allen. = Fresh (1973) and Small Talk (1974) = Despite the loss of the original rhythm section and Sly's escalating cocaine use, the band's next album, Fresh, was released in 1973. By this time, Sly's sound had become more stripped down, yet more syncopated and rhythmically complex.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ Review for Fresh by Sly and the Family Stone]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on January 18, 2007. Sly obsessively overdubbed the masters, as he had done with Riot.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 164‚Äì167. Although the record received mixed reviews at its release and did not attract the attention enjoyed by the band's earlier work, Fresh has become recognized as one of the most important funk albums ever made. Rose Stone sang lead on a gospel-styled cover of Doris Day's \\"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\\", and the single \\"If You Want Me to Stay\\" became a Top 20 hit in the U.S. Its follow-up, Small Talk, was released in 1974 to mixed reviews and low sales.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 174.[ Sly and the Family Stone: Billboard Singles]. All Media Guide, LLC. (2006). Retrieved on February 4, 2007. The first Small Talk single, \\"Time For Livin'\\", became the band's final Top 40 hit single. \\"Loose Booty\\", the second single, peaked at No. 84. = Dissolution = The band's 1975 performance at Radio City Music Hall (shown 2003) was only one-eighth filled During the 1970s, Sly or another of the band members would often miss a gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use, impacting their live bookings.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 141‚Äì145. At many gigs, concert-goers rioted if the band failed to appear or if Sly walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group's promoter, and later their general manager, when other representatives would not work with the band because of their erratic attendance.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 186‚Äì189. In January 1975, the band booked itself at Radio City Music Hall. The famed music hall was only one-eighth filled, and Sly and company had to scrape together money to return home.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 188‚Äì191. Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved. Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham's group, Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for Back on the Right Track, he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married Leon Russell and worked with him on music projects.Ankeny, Jason. [ Leon Russell]. All Music Guide. Retrieved on February 5, 2007.

High On You was billed as a Sly Stone solo album; Heard You Missed Me was a Sly and the Family Stone album in name only. Although Sly continued to collaborate with some of the original Family Stone members on occasion, the actual band no longer existed. Sly played most of the instruments on record himself; he maintained a band to support him for live shows. Among his main collaborators were Cynthia Robinson and Pat Rizzo from the Family Stone, and background vocalists Lynn Mabry and Dawn Silva, who parted with Sly in 1977 and formed The Brides of Funkenstein in 1978. Epic released Stone from his contract in 1977, and in 1979 released 10 Years Too Soon, a remix album featuring disco versions of the 1960s Family Stone hits. Sly signed with Warner Bros. and recorded Back on the Right Track (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable to return to the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981.Birchmeier, Jason.

When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as Ain't But the One Way in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone toured the United States with various backup acts. In June 1983 in Ft. Myers, Florida, he was arrested on drug possession and entered court-ordered drug rehabilitation in 1983. Once released Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music. In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the Red Hot Organization's dance compilation album, Red Hot + Dance, contributing an original track,\\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix).\\" The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities. On August 16, 2011, the album I'm Back! Family & Friends was released. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly and the Family Stone's greatest hits with guest appearances from Jeff Beck, Ray Manzarek, Bootsy Collins, Ann Wilson, Carmine Appice, and Johnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs. One month later, on September 25, 2011, the New York Post reported that Sly Stone was now homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: \\"The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where 'Boyz n the Hood' was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house.\\" Musical style and legacy =Early years= Sly Stone produced for and performed with black and white musicians during his early career, and he integrated music by white artists into black radio station KSOL's playlist as a DJ. Similarly, the Sly and the Family Stone sound was a melting pot of many influences and cultures, including James Brown funk, Motown pop, Stax soul, Broadway showtunes, and psychedelic rock music.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas .

These calls against prejudice and self-hate were underscored by the band's on-stage appearance. Caucasians Gregg Errico and Jerry Martini were members of the band at a time when integrated performance bands were virtually unknown; integration had only recently become enforced by law. Females Cynthia Robinson and Rosie Stone played instruments onstage, rather than just providing vocals or serving as visual accompaniment for the male members.

Although \\"Dance to the Music\\" was the band's only hit single until late 1968, the impact of that single and the Dance to the Music and Life albums reverberated across the music industry. The smooth, piano-based \\"Motown sound\\" was out; \\"psychedelic soul\\" was in, and the band would become a leading exponent of the sound. Rock-styled guitar lines similar to the ones Freddie Stone played began appearing in the music of artists such as The Isley Brothers (\\"It's Your Thing\\") and Diana Ross & the Supremes (\\"Love Child\\"). Larry Graham invented the \\"slapping technique\\" of bass guitar playing, which became synonymous with funk music. Some musicians changed their sound completely to co-opt that of Sly and the Family Stone, most notably Motown in- house producer Norman Whitfield, who took his main act The Temptations into \\"psychedelic soul\\" territory starting with the Grammy-winning \\"Cloud Nine\\" in 1968.

The 14 original Art Deco buildings, commissioned by the Rockefeller family, span the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, split by a large sunken square and a private street called Rockefeller Plaza. Later additions include 75 Rockefeller Plaza across 51st Street at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza, and four International Style buildings located on the west side of Sixth Avenue. In 1928, the site's then-owner, Columbia University, leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who was the main person behind the complex's construction. Originally envisioned as the site for a new Metropolitan Opera building, the current Rockefeller Center came about after the Met could not afford to move to the proposed new building. Various plans were discussed before the current one was approved in 1932. Construction of Rockefeller Center started in 1931, and the first buildings opened in 1933. The core of the complex was completed by 1939. The original center has several sections. Radio City, along Sixth Avenue and centered on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, includes Radio City Music Hall and was built for RCA's radio-related enterprises such as NBC. The International Complex along Fifth Avenue was built to house foreign-based tenants. The remainder of the original complex originally hosted printed media as well as Eastern Air Lines. While 600 Fifth Avenue is located at the southeast corner of the complex, it was built by private interests in the 1950s and was only acquired by the center in 1963. Described as one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era, Rockefeller Center was declared a New York City landmark in 1985 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. It is noted for the large quantities of art present in almost all of its Art Deco buildings, its expansive underground concourse, and its ice-skating rink. The complex is also famous for its annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. History=Context= The first private owner of the site was physician David Hosack, who purchased twenty acres of rural land from New York City in 1801 for $5,000 and opened the country's first botanical garden, the Elgin Botanic Garden, on the site. The gardens operated until 1811, and by 1823, ended up in the ownership of Columbia University. Columbia moved its main campus north to Morningside Heights by the turn of the century. old Metropolitan Opera House (pictured). In 1926, the Metropolitan Opera started looking for locations to build a new opera house to replace the existing building at 39th Street and Broadway. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the Met to fund by itself, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. eventually gave his support to the project (John D. Rockefeller Sr., his father, was not involved). Rockefeller hired Todd, Robertson and Todd as design consultants to determine its viability. John R. Todd then put forth a plan for the Met. Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years at a cost of $3 million per year. The initial cost of acquiring the space, razing some of the existing buildings, and constructing new buildings was estimated at $250 million. The lease initially excluded a strip along Sixth Avenue on the west side of the plot, as well as another property on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets. Rockefeller hosted a \\"symposium\\" of architectural firms to solicit plans for the complex, but it did not yield any meaningful plans. He ultimately hired Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray; Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux; and Reinhard & Hofmeister, to design the buildings. They worked under the umbrella of \\"Associated Architects\\" so none of the buildings could be attributed to any specific firm. The principal builder and \\"managing agent\\" for the massive project was John R. Todd, one of the co-founders of Todd, Robertson and Todd. The principal architect and leader of the Associated Architects was Raymond Hood, a student of the Art Deco architectural movement. The other architects included Harvey Wiley Corbett and Wallace Harrison. L. Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister had been hired by John Todd as the \\"rental architects\\", who designed the floor plans for the complex. Today The Metropolitan Square Corporation (the precursor to Rockefeller Center Inc.) was formed in December 1928 to oversee construction. However, the Metropolitan Opera wanted to hold out for a more favorable lease because it worried about the site's profitability. After the stock market crash of 1929, the Metropolitan Opera could not afford to move anymore, and on December 6, 1929, the plans for the new opera house were abandoned completely. In order to make a profit on the site as quickly as possible, Rockefeller devised new plans within a month so that the site could become profitable. The developers entered into talks with Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May, RCA and its affiliates had made an agreement with Rockefeller Center managers to lease space and develop part of the complex. Todd released a new plan \\"G-3\\" in January 1930. Two months later, an \\"H plan\\" was released with facilities for \\"television, music, radio, talking pictures and plays\\", as well as four theaters. Under Rockefeller's plan, the demolition of the site's existing structures would start in the fall, and the complex would be complete by 1933. Another plan was announced in March 1931, but the proposal received mostly negative feedback from the public. An oval-shaped building with rooftop gardens, included in the original plan, was later replaced with four small retail buildings and a 41-story tower, comprising the current International Complex. The updated plan also included rooftop gardens and a recessed central plaza. The International Complex was eventually occupied by British, French, and Italian tenants, leading to its current name. The design of the complex was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required setbacks to all high street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings in order to increase sunlight for city streets. During early planning, the development was often referred to as \\"Radio City\\", \\"Rockefeller City\\", or \\"Metropolitan Square\\" (after the Metropolitan Square Corporation). Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller family's publicity adviser, suggested changing the name to \\"Rockefeller Center\\". John Rockefeller Jr. initially did not want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. The name was formally changed in December 1931. Over time, the appellation of \\"Radio City\\" devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex's western section, and by 1937, only the Radio City Music Hall contained the \\"Radio City\\" name. =Construction= For the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated. Demolition of the properties began in 1930. All of the buildings' leases had been bought by August 1931, though there were some tenants on the western and southeastern edges of the plot who refused to leave their property, and Rockefeller Center was built around these buildings. Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the complex began in July 1931, and construction on the first buildings‚Äîthe Music Hall and Center Theatre‚Äîbegan in September and November, respectively. The plans for the complex notably included Indiana Limestone on the facades of the fourteen planned buildings, and the builders ordered of limestone in December 1931, the largest such order at the time. Construction progress in December 1933 The RKO Building was the first structure to be completed, in September 1932, followed by the Music Hall in December 1932 and the British Empire Building in April 1933. The RCA Building's opening was delayed from May 1 to mid-May because of a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting in the building's lobby, which was later covered up and removed. A new street through the complex, Rockefeller Plaza, was constructed in stages between 1933 and 1937. The complex's famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza was erected for the first time in December 1933, and the complex's Prometheus statue was constructed in May 1934. By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened. Work on two more internationally themed retail buildings and a larger, 38-story, \\"International Building\\", started in September 1934. One of the two small buildings was already rented to Italian interests. The final small building would have been rented by Germany, but Rockefeller ruled this out in 1934 after noticing National Socialist extremism from the country's government. The empty office site was downsized and became the \\"International Building North\\", rented by various international tenants. In April 1935, developers opened the International Building and its wings. The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system between 48th and 51st streets was finished in early May. In 1936, an ice skating rink replaced the unprofitable retail space on the lower plaza, below ground level. The 36-story Time & Life Building, named for anchor tenant Time Inc., was completed in November 1936, replacing an empty plot on the southern block that had been used for vehicle parking. Eleven buildings had been completed by 1937 at a total cost of over $100 million. A building for Associated Press on the northern block's empty lot, which had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house, was topped out by June 1938 and occupied by December of that year. The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. The Guild, a newsreel theater, opened in 1938 along the curve of the truck ramp below the Associated Press Building. After Nelson Rockefeller became president of Rockefeller Center in 1938, he fired John Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. The Rockefeller family started occupying the 56th floor of the RCA Building, though the offices would later expand to the 54th and 55th floors as well. A proposed 16-story building in the center of the southernmost block was offered to the Dutch government in 1938. The Dutch government did not enter the agreement because of World War II, though it did move into temporary offices in the International Building. Instead, Eastern Air Lines signed a lease for the 16-story building in June 1940. Excavation started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939. At the same time, Rockefeller Center Inc. wanted to develop the western half of the southern plot, which was partially occupied by the Center Theatre. The United States Rubber Company agreed to occupy the plot. and excavation of the U.S. Rubber Company Building site commenced in May 1939. John Rockefeller installed the building's ceremonial final rivet on November 1, 1939, marking the completion of the original complex. However, although the final rivet had been driven, the Eastern Air Lines Building was not completed until October 1940. 50 Rockefeller Plaza, one of the last structures to be constructed in the original complex The construction of the project employed between 40,000 and 60,000 people. The complex was the largest private building project ever undertaken in contemporary times. Architectural historian Carol Herselle Krinsky describes the center as \\"the only large private permanent construction project planned and executed between the start of the Depression and the end of the Second World War\\". According to writer Daniel Okrent, Rockefeller Center was so extensive that it was said that \\"you could do anything you wanted except sleep (no hotels), pray (no churches), or not pay rent to\\" John Rockefeller Jr. By fall 1939, the complex had 26,000 tenants and 125,000 daily visitors. That year, 1.3 million people went on a guided tour of Rockefeller Center or visited the RCA Building's observation deck, while 6 million people visited the underground shopping mall, and 7 million saw a performance at Rockefeller Center. =World War II era= Even before the U.S. officially entered World War II in 1941, Rockefeller Center was affected by the war. The Dutch government had been slated to take up one-fifth of the space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, but could not do so because of World War II. Seven of the complex's eight travel agencies had to move elsewhere because of the war, and William Rhodes Davis, a tenant who shipped oil to Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, was denied a lease renewal in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Rockefeller Center Inc. terminated all lease agreements with German, Italian, and Japanese tenants because their respective countries comprised the Axis powers, whom the United States were fighting against. Art on Palazzo d'Italia was taken down because they were seen as being fascist, and the Rainbow Room was closed to the public from 1943 to 1950. Instructions for blackouts and sandbags for extinguishing fires were placed throughout the complex. During the war, the RCA Building's Room 3603 became the primary location of the U.S. operations of British Intelligence's British Security Co- ordination, organized by William Stephenson. It also served as the office of Allen Dulles, who would later head the Central Intelligence Agency. Rockefeller Center only became profitable after the last building in the original complex was completed. The complex had incurred $26 million in debt by 1935, which had increased to $39 million by 1940. However, the complex was already 87% rented by 1940, and by the next year, Rockefeller Center was nearly fully rented, making a profit for the first time in its history. By 1944, the complex's existing rentable area totaled , with 99.7% of the space being leased. Because the complex was almost completely rented, Rockefeller Center's managers kept waiting lists of potential tenants, and as a result of the waiting lists, the complex's office space became more desirable to these tenants. Two years later, there were 400 companies who wanted to rent space in Rockefeller Center, and the complex's managers determined that they would need to add of space in order to house all the prospective tenants. Rockefeller Center was also popular among visitors: for instance, the lines to enter one of the Music Hall's five daily shows stretched from Sixth Avenue and 50th Street to Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, a distance of four blocks. In light of the abundance of possible renters, John Rockefeller Jr. transferred his ownership of the complex to his sons. The father collected the $57.5 million loan that Rockefeller Center Inc. owed him, then distributed it to his sons in the form of a tax break. Rockefeller Center eventually became the family's \\"single largest repository\\" of wealth. In 1950, Rockefeller Center Inc. paid the last installment of the $65 million mortgage owed to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Three years later, the complex was making $5 million per year in profit, excluding the tax breaks. = Post-World War II expansion = 75 Rockefeller Plaza, built in 1947 Rockefeller Center Inc. had started working on plans to expand the complex during World War II, even though the outbreak of the war had stopped almost all civilian construction projects. In 1943, the complex's managers bought land and buildings on three street corners near the complex. Rockefeller Center unveiled plans for expansion to the southwest and north in 1944. Esso (now Exxon) was one of the tenants who wanted to expand, and the company signaled that it would build its own office tower if Rockefeller Center's managers did not construct a building for them. They were given land at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza. In February 1947, the under-construction Esso Building, at the north end of the existing property, became part of Rockefeller Center after ownership of the building was transferred from the Haswin Corporation to Rockefeller Center, Inc. The building was topped out the next month. Hugh Robertson stepped down as manager the next year, and he was replaced by Gustav Eyssell. Some tenants, such as the Sinclair Oil Corporation, indicated that they wanted to leave the complex after their leases expired in 1962‚Äì1963 because the original complex's buildings did not have air conditioning, while newer office buildings did. As Columbia University still owned the land underneath the complex, they were tasked with installing air conditioning in the buildings. The new building would add emphasis to any north-south views of the center, since the existing complex's building only formed west-east axes. Another problem befell Rockefeller Center's key tenants, NBC and RCA, who were approached by other developers with the promise of more leasable space, a commodity that was scarce in the fully leased complex. These problems were pushed aside temporarily by the onset of the Korean War in 1950. By 1951, Columbia had acquiesced to reimbursing Rockefeller Center, Inc., for AC installation, while NBC and RCA were given permission to use the Center Theatre for extra broadcasting space. In 1949, in the face of a shrinking congregation, the St. Nicholas Church leased the church building to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, who then leased three contiguous plots from Rockefeller Center for a proposed 28-story building. The congregation was dispersed to other churches, and the old church building at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street was subsequently demolished. Construction commenced on 600 Fifth Avenue in 1950, and the tower was completed by 1952. The building was named after the Sinclair Oil Company, who leased eight floors. As a result of Sinclair's relocation to 600 Fifth Avenue, as well as Esso's relocation to 75 Rockefeller Plaza, NBC and RCA could expand into the space that Sinclair and Esso formerly occupied in the original complex, and they moved out of the Center Theatre shortly after the Sinclair Oil Company moved into its own tower. In summer 1953, Columbia bought all of the land along Sixth Avenue that had been owned by the Underel Corporation, at a cost of $5.5 million. Rockefeller Center leased the land back to Columbia until 1973 for $200,000 a year. This allowed Columbia to install air conditioning, passing the costs on to the remaining tenants in return for lease extensions. The small Center Theatre was deemed redundant to the Radio City Music Hall, and in its final years, had been used as an NBC and RCA broadcasting space. After NBC and RCA expanded into the floor area formerly occupied by Sinclair, the U.S. Rubber Company indicated that it wanted to expand its office building into the space that was taken up by the underused theater. In October 1953, it was announced that the theater would be demolished. It was demolished in 1954. Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza was also becoming insufficient. In August 1953, Rockefeller Center, Inc., bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets. In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on that plot. The , $7 million building would include connections to the existing passageway system and to Roxy's Theater directly to its west. Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower's rent income between Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center. Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and the structure topped out in November of that year. The building officially opened in December 1959. Around 1960, Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp. Originally, the venture wanted to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center, but ultimately, a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building was built on the site. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, who leased eight floors in the future building. The hotel, New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, was built two blocks north in 1963. 600 Fifth Avenue was sold to Rockefeller Center's managers in 1963, thus officially becoming part of Rockefeller Center. The same year, officials from Esso (later renamed Exxon) proposed a new building for the complex because the company had outgrown the space in the buildings it already occupied. Rockefeller Center's managers hired the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz to design three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one tower on each block between 47th and 50th streets. The Exxon Building, at 1251 Avenue of the Americas between 49th and 50th streets, was formally announced in August 1967. Three months later, officials also announced plans for a tower housing McGraw-Hill, located one block south at 1221 Avenue of the Americas. Plans for a tower anchored by Celanese, to be located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas between 47th and 48th streets, would not be revealed until 1970. The Exxon Building opened in 1971, followed by the McGraw-Hill Building in 1973 and the Celanese Building in 1974. By the time all three of the new buildings were opened, Rockefeller Center contained 7% of Manhattan's of leasable office space. = Late 20th and early 21st centuries = Rockefeller Center's landmark plaque 600 Fifth Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza received renovations in the early 1970s. Unlike in the rest of the complex, where different components were renovated one at a time to avoid disturbing tenants, the two structures were renovated all at once because their space was largely vacant. Rockefeller Center Inc. renewed their lease on the complex in 1973. Through the 1960s, the Music Hall was successful regardless of the status of the city's economic, business, or entertainment sectors as a whole. However, by the early 1970s, the proliferation of closed-captioned foreign movies had reduced attendance at the Music Hall. The first round of staff and performer firings began in 1972. By January 1978, the Music Hall was in debt, and the hall's annual attendance had declined to 1.5 million visitors, down from 5 million in 1968. Officials stated that it could not remain open after April. A grassroots campaign formed the Showpeople's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall, and after several weeks of lobbying, the interior was made a city landmark in March, followed by a National Register of Historic Places listing in May. The hall was set to close on April 12, but five days before the planned closing date, the Empire State Development Corporation voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease the Music Hall. A New York Times report in 1982 stated that Rockefeller Center had been popular among tenants from its inception, being almost fully rented for much of the first half-century of its existence. The major exception was in the 1970s, when it was only 85% rented. However, Rockefeller Center was not popular as an entertainment complex, having been used for mainly commercial purposes through its history. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission extended the Music Hall's landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex's buildings in 1985. In its approval of the complex's status, the commission wrote, \\"Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States\\". The buildings became a National Historic Landmark two years later. The United States Department of the Interior wrote in its report that the center was \\"one of the most successful urban planning projects in the history of American architecture\\". Columbia University was not making enough money from Rockefeller Center leases by the 1970s, since a series of negotiations with Rockefeller Center Inc. (now Rockefeller Group) had effectively reduced the annual lease payment to $11 million. The university's funds had dwindled so much that by 1972, their expenses were paid for by their endowment fund. In 1983, Columbia University started looking to sell the land beneath Rockefeller Center. Two years later, Columbia agreed to sell the land to the Rockefeller Group for $400 million. The Rockefeller Group immediately set out to modernize many aspects of the complex. The Rainbow Room was closed for a $20 million restoration and expansion that brought the restaurant's floor area to , and it reopened in December 1987. The RCA Building's observation deck was subsequently closed because the Rainbow Room's expansion eliminated the only passageway to the observatory's elevator bank. In mid-1988, the RCA Building was renamed the GE Building. Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate company of the Mitsubishi Group, purchased the Rockefeller Group in 1989. Seven years later, in July 1996, the entire complex was purchased by a consortium of owners that included Goldman Sachs (which had 50 percent ownership), Gianni Agnelli, Stavros Niarchos, and David Rockefeller, who organized the consortium. Before the sale was even completed, the consortium sold of space in 30 Rockefeller Plaza to NBC, who had rented that space in the tower since the beginning. Tishman Speyer, led by Jerry Speyer, a close friend of David Rockefeller, and the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought the original 14 buildings and land in 2000 for $1.85 billion. Owing to the decline of the newsreel theater industry, the Guild was shuttered in late 1999 after Tishman Speyer decided not to renew its lease. Tishman Speyer also decided to renovate the complex's retail spaces and underground concourse. The Rainbow Room closed in 2009 in preparation for an extensive renovation that started in 2011. The restaurant reopened in October 2014. The Rockefeller family moved out of their offices in the GE Building in 2014 due to rising rents. They re-settled in less expensive offices on 49th Street, near their old headquarters. The next year, in July 2015, the GE Building was renamed after Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal. Buildings The current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building: the original 14 Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s, one building across 51st Street built in 1947, and a set of four International-style towers built along the west side of Avenue of the Americas during the 1960s and 1970s. The center spans in total, with some in office space. =Landmarked buildings= The landmarked buildings comprise in Midtown, bounded by Fifth and Sixth avenues between 48th and 51st streets. Built as a cohesive unit, the buildings have been owned by Tishman Speyer since 2000. The buildings are spread along six blocks, with three blocks facing each avenue. These six blocks are the size of three standard blocks. One of the landmark buildings' defining features is the Indiana limestone facade possessed by all 14 structures, as specified in the original plans. All of the structures were designed by Associated Architects, with Raymond Hood as the principal architect, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Radio City The east side of Sixth Avenue, officially known as Avenue of the Americas, contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex. These buildings, which comprise \\"Radio City\\", are 1230 Avenue of the Americas, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Music Hall and 1270 Avenue of the Americas. The idea for an integrated media complex somewhere came in 1920, when Owen D. Young, the chairman of RCA parent General Electric, suggested that RCA combine its then-disparate offices into one location. 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its former \\"GE\\" neon sign, viewed from 5th Avenue and 46th Street to the south The western half of the southernmost block of the complex along Sixth Avenue, between 48th and 49th streets, contains the former U.S. Rubber Company Building (now Simon & Schuster Building) at 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The last structure in the original complex to be built, it was topped out in November 1939. The 23-story building contains two 7-story wings on its north and south sides. It was renamed after Uniroyal in 1967, and again after Simon & Schuster in 1976. 1230 Avenue of the Americas was expanded to the east in 1954 after the Center Theatre adjacent to it was demolished. The 19-story annex, designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, had a glass facade on the lowest two stories‚Äîreflecting the design of the former American Airlines Building across Sixth Avenue‚Äîand a limestone facade above the second story. It is aligned with the axis of 10 Rockefeller Plaza on the eastern side of the block, and its northern and southern elevations contain five setbacks. The exterior also houses an abstract bas-relief created by Naum Gabo. The Center Theatre, at 1236 Sixth Avenue, was the only structure in the original Rockefeller Center to be demolished. Originally the \\"Roxy Theatre\\", it was renamed after William Fox sued Roxy Rothafel over the naming rights to the nearby Roxy Theatre, which Rothafel had originally managed. The 3,700-seat Center Theatre had a short massing (general shape) in place due to height restrictions at the time, which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums. The theater's stage was enlarged for musicals in 1936, and four years later, 380 seats were removed in order to make way for an ice rink for skating spectaculars. It showed film, musicals, ice-skating competitions, and television through its 21-year existence. Due to its duplication of the larger Radio City Music Hall's activities, it was deemed uneconomical almost from its opening, and was considered redundant by the 1950s. In 1954, it was replaced by the expansion of 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The block immediately to the north, on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is occupied by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its western annex at 1250 Sixth Avenue. The 70-floor, building anchors the entire complex, and is located on the eastern side of the block. Opened in 1933 as the RCA Building, the building has been renamed multiple times, first to the GE Building in 1988, after General Electric bought RCA, and then to the Comcast Building in 2014 after Comcast's purchase of NBC. 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. It has three main segments: the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, and, formerly, the Rockefeller family office; a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses NBC Studios; and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 Avenue of the Americas. As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex, with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels. The southwest corner of Radio City Music Hall, as seen diagonally across the intersection of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street Radio City Music Hall at 1260 Avenue of the Americas, occupying the southwestern portion of the block between 50th and 51st streets. The only remaining theater in the complex, it was similar in style to the Center Theatre, but at a larger scale. Construction started in December 1931, and the hall opened in December 1932. The Music Hall seats 6,000 people, and since opening has seen over 300 million visitors. Located in a niche adjacent to the neighboring 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the Music Hall is housed under the building's seventh-floor setback. The other building on the block between 50th and 51st streets is 1270 Avenue of the Americas, a 31-story structure with a setback on the sixth floor. Originally the RKO Building, it was built over the Music Hall and shares many of the same exterior architectural details. Construction of the building started in 1931, and the building was complete by September 1932. Henry Hofmeister designed the building, as well as several other office buildings in the city that were built over theaters. The building's entrance design, blending in with that of the other buildings in the Radio City section, is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by Robert Garrison for each of the building's three bays, signifying muses of Contemporary Thought, Morning, and Evening. In 1990, Robert Kushner created three bronze sculptures of winged spirits for the lobby. The RKO Building served as headquarters for its namesake company's movie production in the 1930s, and was renamed for the American Metal Climax Company (AMAX), its new owners, in the early 1960s. International complex The Channel Gardens between the British and French buildings The International Complex is located entirely along Fifth Avenue, with the tall International Building overshadowing four smaller country-themed buildings with retail outlets. Three of the buildings‚Äîthe tall tower and the two southern retail buildings‚Äîwere planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931, while the two retail buildings to the north were added later. The low rectangular structures that replaced the oval building were seen as a more suitable design for the avenue. The current international theme was decided on due to a lack of American tenants willing to rent there; eventually, the buildings were occupied by British, French, and Italian interests, although the Italian interests ultimately were the only foreign tenants who rented for the long term. All four retail buildings have identical limestone facades, roof gardens, and ground-floor storefronts, but differ in the artworks with which they were decorated. Contemporary advertisements for shopping on Fifth Avenue touted the complex's proximity to Saks Fifth Avenue and St. Patrick's Cathedral. When viewed from Fifth Avenue, the buildings provide a foreground for the taller 30 Rockefeller Plaza building behind them. The Channel Gardens separate the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The southernmost of the four retail buildings is La Maison Francaise (literally \\"the French House\\") at 610 Fifth Avenue, which opened in October 1933. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial -story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. Immediately across the Channel Gardens to the north of La Maison Francaise is its twin, the British Empire Building at 620 Fifth Avenue, which opened in April 1933. It is also a standalone building, with exactly the same massing as La Maison Francaise, down to the setback, rooftop garden, and half-penthouse. The International Building has the address 630 Fifth Avenue to its east, or 45 Rockefeller Plaza to its west. The tower stands at 41 stories high, including mechanical floors. One of two skyscrapers that opened in Manhattan in 1935, it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction, as well as the construction quality, overall design, and materials used. The building, located in the middle of the block between Rockefeller Plaza and Fifth Avenue, contains a central plaza on its east, facing the Fifth Avenue entrance, which contains the famous statue of Atlas. The Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North serve as six- story retail wings of the International Building. The Palazzo d'Italia is located at 626 Fifth Avenue, on the south side of the plaza, while International Building North is located at 636 Fifth Avenue, north of the plaza. Other buildings 1 Rockefeller Plaza, the original Time & Life Building The 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets, is the original Time & Life Building that was opened in April 1937. Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion. In 1960, the building was renamed for General Dynamics after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away. The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to St. Louis in 1971. 10 Rockefeller Plaza is located opposite 1 Rockefeller, on the west side of the plaza. Its planning name was the Holland House, but the Dutch government did not sign on, so the building became the Eastern Air Lines Building instead. 10 Rockefeller was built as a 16-story slab, basically a miniature version of 1 Rockefeller. 10 Rockefeller's six-story parking garage was the first in Rockefeller Center. Notable modern tenants include the Today Show studios, and since 2005, the Nintendo New York store. 50 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly the Associated Press Building, is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st streets. It was constructed in the spring of 1938. The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate‚Äînamely, a blocky structure with no setbacks. 600 Fifth Avenue is located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 48th Street and was built after the other buildings in the main complex, opening in 1952. The 28-story tower was once also known as the Sinclair Oil Building and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building. Its L-shaped footprint surrounds another building at the corner of 49th Street and Fifth Avenue, such that it fronts on 48th Street, on Fifth Avenue, but only midblock on 49th Street. Carson and Lundin designed 600 Fifth Avenue, along with 666 Fifth Avenue three blocks north, to complement the Rockefeller complex between the two towers. 600 Fifth Avenue contains a limestone facade, consistent with that of the original complex, as well as a seventh-story setback on its Fifth Avenue side and rooftop gardens on its setbacks. The building contains a main lobby at 48th Street, a service entrance to the same street, and a connection to 1 Rockefeller Plaza at its west end. Unlike other buildings in the complex, 600 Fifth Avenue's ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space, which was originally leased by Swiss interests and Pan Am Airlines. =Later buildings= 75 Rockefeller Plaza The buildings subsequently added are separately owned by multiple owners. The first subsequent building to be built was 75 Rockefeller Plaza, at 51st Street on the north end of the complex, was built in 1947. The building contains a low base that is level with the rooftops of the low-rise buildings on 51st and 52nd Street, as well as a tall slab rising from the base, aligned in a north-south direction. It was originally built privately, but ownership was transferred to Rockefeller Center in February 1947. The 33-story, building was originally called the Esso Building. It was the headquarters of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (later Exxon) until the early 1970s. The Esso Building was later renamed after Warner Communications, Time Warner and AOL Time Warner. It is now owned by Mohamed Al Fayed and managed by RXR Realty. The other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 47th and 51st streets. Erected from 1958 through 1974, they were all built by the same firm, Harrison, Abramovitz & Harris. The $300 million project was part of a drive to get large companies such as Celanese Corporation, McGraw-Hill, Exxon, and Time Inc. to invest in the center. The new project added a combined of space to the existing center when it was completed, and was attractive to potential tenants because of this. The following buildings are part of the newer Sixth Avenue expansion: * 1211 Avenue of the Americas, the former Celanese Building, is located between 47th and 48th streets. The tower opened in 1974. Now the News Corp Building, it is owned by an affiliate of Beacon Capital Partners, and leasing is managed by Cushman & Wakefield. * 1221 Avenue of the Americas, the former McGraw-Hill Building, is located between 48th and 49th streets. The building opened in 1973 and is owned by the Rockefeller Group. * 1251 Avenue of the Americas, the former Exxon Building, is located between 49th and 50th streets. This building was built from 1967 to 1971. Exxon's corporate headquarters moved into the structure in 1972, with co-ownership with Rockefeller Center's managers, and held an ownership stake there until 1986, when Mitsui & Company purchased the building. Exxon moved its headquarters to Texas in 1989, vacating all of the space in 1251 Avenue of the Americas.Pearson, Anne and Ralph Bivins. \\"Exxon moving corporate headquarters to Dallas\\". Houston Chronicle. October 27, 1989. p. A1. Retrieved on July 29, 2009. * 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the former Time & Life Building, is located between 50th and 51st streets. The building was completed in 1958 Construction on the Time-Life's Building's steelwork started in April 1958, and is owned by the Rockefeller Group. Other architectural elements=Lower Plaza= At the front of 30 Rock is the Lower Plaza, located in the very center of the complex and below ground level. The center plaza was part of the plans for the canceled Metropolitan Opera House. Although the opera house was canceled in 1929, the plaza was retained in subsequent plans. Originally, the plaza would have been located at ground level with a promenade called Channel Gardens, which led westward from Fifth Avenue to the plaza. In the March 1931 revision to the complex's blueprint, the center plaza was enhanced and sunken. The sunken plaza was originally supposed to be oval- shaped, but the plaza was later changed to a rectangular shape. The sunken rectangular plaza, planted with shrubs, provided a sense of privacy and enclosure when it was originally built. The plaza's main entrance is through the Channel Gardens, a , planted pedestrian esplanade running westward from Fifth Avenue between the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The steeply sloping promenade was originally furnished with six narrow pools in the center of the space, each surrounded by hedges. The pools are topped with fountain heads designed by Rene Chambellan, each representing a different attribute: leadership, will, thought, imagination, energy, and alertness. Chambellan also designed the fountains' drain covers with various bronze depictions of sea creatures such as turtles and crabs. During the winter, the Channel Gardens' fountains were shut off and decorated with Valerie Clarebout's sculptures of angels. The twelve sculptures, each measuring tall, have been placed in the gardens every winter since 1954. At the western end of the promenade is a plaque commemorating the original Elgin Gardens, as well as a bronze monumental plaque to John D. Rockefeller Jr (see below). From there, a flight of the steps descends toward the rink, then splits into two different stairs heading both north and south. The western end of the plaza contains Paul Manship's 1933 masterwork, Prometheus (see also ). The statue stands in a fountain basin in front of a grey rectangular wall. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is placed above the statue from November to January every year; it is usually put in place and lit the week after Thanksgiving, and taken down the week after New Year's Day. The first tree was erected in 1934, and as successive trees received more lavish decorations, the tradition gradually became known worldwide. The ice rink Much of the plaza's outdoor section is occupied by an ice rink. Installed in 1936, it replaced unprofitable retail space that had been constructed as part of the original center. Originally intended as a \\"temporary\\" measure, the rink became an immediate tourist attraction upon opening, becoming one of the world's most famous skating rinks in later years. In 1939, a permanent rink was installed, which necessitated the replacement of the center staircase from Channel Gardens.. * For a reference to the roller skating rink's opening, see: Its popularity inspired the construction of a skating rink in the former Center Theatre, and for a short time, there were also proposals to convert the lower plaza's ice rink to a roller skating rink during the springtime. The northern, southern, and eastern sides of the plaza are surrounded by a walkway that is several steps below street level, with staircases at either western end as well as at the plaza's Channel Gardens entrance. Some 200 flagpoles surround the plaza's perimeter at ground level, installed at regular intervals along the walkway and Rockefeller Plaza. The poles were installed in 1942 and were originally intended to be temporary. The flags later became permanent installations, fitting in with the nearby International Complex. The poles originally displayed the flags of the United Nations' member countries, although in later years they also carried flags of the U.S. states and territories, or decorative and seasonal motifs. Originally, there were 26 flags for each of the members of the United Nations, but as more countries became UN members, additional rows of poles were added on the north and south sides of the plaza. During national and state holidays, every pole carries the flag of the United States. The flags' ropes are secured with locks to prevent people from tampering with the flags. In July 1962, two years after John Rockefeller Jr.'s death, the center's management placed a plaque at the plaza, containing a list of ten principles in which he believed. The creed was first expressed in 1941. Rockefeller's beliefs include \\"the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" (the first principle) and \\"truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order\\" (the sixth principle). The architect I. M. Pei praised Rockefeller Center's lower plaza as being \\"perhaps the most successful open space in the United States, perhaps in the world\\", due to its success in drawing visitors. The plaza has also inspired similar developments around the world. =Rockefeller Plaza= Rockefeller Plaza Rockefeller Plaza is a pedestrian street running through the complex, parallel to Fifth and Sixth avenues. This street was also part of the original plans for the Metropolitan Opera, and Benjamin Morris originally intended for the road to stretch from 42nd to 59th streets. Only the section between 48th and 51st streets was built, and the road was open in its entirety by 1937. The road was given the name \\"Rockefeller Plaza\\" in 1933, despite the potential confusion with the Lower Plaza, because it was believed that the \\"Plaza\\" in the road's name would emphasize its \\"spatial unity\\" with the Lower Plaza and Channel Gardens. The original intention of the street's construction was to enhance the shopping district of Fifth Avenue, to its east, but this never happened, and Rockefeller Plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of Rockefeller Center's separate components. As with most numbered crosstown streets in Manhattan, Rockefeller Plaza is wide with curbs on either side of an asphalt surface. However, the sidewalks are much wider than on typical streets. In addition, Rockefeller Plaza is supported by a multi-level steel skeleton underneath, which houses the underground mall, storage rooms, and the complex's shipping and loading center. As such, it contains a layer of waterproofing. The surface of Rockefeller Plaza outside Radio City Music Hall, between 50th and 51st Street, contains small bronze circles for theatergoers to stand on while waiting to enter the hall. Until the 1980s, the plaza contained plaques that affirmed Columbia University's ownership of Rockefeller Center, but these were removed with the 1985 sale of the complex to the Rockefeller Group. Since Rockefeller Plaza is technically a purely private property to which the public is welcome, the plaza is closed for part of one day every year. =Rooftop gardens= Gardens on the roofs of Rockefeller Center's International Complex, as viewed from the International Building The gardens atop Rockefeller Center's roofs were designed by Ralph Hancock and Raymond Hood. They came about because both Hood and Todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex's beauty; in particular, Hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house. Originally, the gardens were supposed to be all interconnected via bridges between the roofs of each building. However, after Hood's death in 1935, the garden plan fell apart, as most of the complex's final buildings were built without provisions for gardens. The Associated Press Building's 15th-story roof, as well as the isolated location of the International Building and the high cost of these gardens, made this system infeasible. Ultimately, gardens were installed on 10 Rockefeller Plaza; 30 Rockefeller Plaza; the four International-themed retail buildings; the Center Theatre; and Radio City Music Hall. The gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 due to various expenses as well as a lack of interest among tourists. The largest and most grand of the gardens was the \\"Garden of the Nations\\" (alternatively \\"Gardens of the Nations\\"), which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and opened in April 1935. The construction effort involved of soil; of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers. They were originally composed of thirteen nation-specific gardens whose layouts were inspired by the gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the nation-themed gardens were separated by barriers. There was an \\"International Garden\\", a rock garden, in the center of the thirteen nation- themed gardens, which featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties. The Garden of the Nations also contained a children's garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch. Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, all of the nation-themed gardens were eventually removed, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were no longer open to the public. The International complex's gardens fared better. Hancock developed the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise's gardens, while A.M. van den Hoek designed the gardens atop the other two buildings. The British and French gardens both contain a lawn and pool surrounded by hedges, while the other two gardens atop the International Building's wings include ivy lawns surrounded by hedges. The Italian garden also contained a cobblestone walkway and two plaques from the Roman Forum, while International Building North's garden has a paved walkway with steps. The roof gardens of the International Building's wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each, followed by the gardens on the British and French buildings, which were restored the next year. =Underground concourse= Exit from the concourse to the subway station A series of shop- and restaurant-filled pedestrian passages stretch underground from 47th to 51st streets between Fifth and Seventh avenues. The pedestrian tunnel system was part of the updated 1931 plan for the center, and formal proposals for the system were submitted in 1933. It was supposed to comprise a system that stretched over , all air-conditioned and lined with shops. Meanwhile, the pair of four-lane roadways was supposed to be located underneath the pedestrian mall, with delivery ramps leading to a central loading area below ground. Later plans also included a people mover. Ultimately, the people mover was not built, but the 25-space mall opened in May 1935. The complex's owner Tishman Speyer renovated the concourse in 1999 in an effort to make the underground retail space more noticeable and attract more upscale tenants. The original bronze ornaments and lighting were replaced, air-conditioning was installed, two passageways were demolished, and both ground-level and underground retail spaces were refurbished as part of the renovation. The concourse is the uppermost level of the complex's four basement levels, as well as the only basement level open to the public. The lower three levels are home to storage rooms and the complex's shipping center, the latter of which is accessed by a delivery ramp at 50th Street. Access is via lobby stairways in the six landmark buildings, through restaurants surrounding the concourse-level skating rink, and via elevators to the north and south of the rink. There is also a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th‚Äì50th Streets‚ÄìRockefeller Center station, serving the . , the largest retailer in the concourse is Banana Republic. =Pre-existing buildings= Two small buildings abut the north and south corners of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza annex. These buildings exist as a result of two tenants who refused to sell their rights to Rockefeller during construction. The grocer John F. Maxwell would only sell his property at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street if he received $1 million in return. However, Rockefeller's assistant Charles O. Heydt mistakenly said that Maxwell would never sell, and Maxwell himself said that he had never been approached by the Rockefellers. Consequently, Rockefeller Center did not purchase Maxwell's property until 1970. Maxwell's demand paled to that of Daniel Hurley and Patrick Daly, owners of a speakeasy who, since 1892, had leased a property at 49th Street. They would sell for $250 million, roughly the cost of the entire complex. They initially gained a lease extension until 1942, but ended up leasing their property until 1975, and was built around Maxwell's and Hurley and Daly's properties. On the southeast corner of the complex, on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets, there were also two pre-existing buildings. Robert Walton Goelet owned a lot at 2‚Äì6 West 49th Street and wished to develop it; the lot was developed as 608 Fifth Avenue, which was completed in 1932. The St. Nicholas Church, located on 48th Street behind Goelet's land, also refused to sell the property despite an offer of up to $7 million for the property. The church was razed in 1949 to make way for 600 Fifth Avenue. Art News by Isamu Noguchi In November 1931, John Todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings. Hartley Burr Alexander, a noted mythology and symbology professor, was tasked with planning the complex's arts installations. Alexander submitted his plan for the site's artwork in December 1932. As part of the proposal, the complex would have a variety of sculptures, statues, murals, friezes, decorative fountains, and mosaics. In an expansion of Hood's setback-garden plan, Alexander's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings, which would create a \\"Babylonian garden\\" when viewed from above. At first, Alexander suggested \\"Homo Fabor, Man the Builder\\" as the complex's overarching theme, representing satisfaction with one's occupation rather than with the wage. However, that theme was not particularly well received by the architects, so Alexander proposed another theme, the \\"New Frontiers\\"; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced \\"after the conquest of the physical world\\". In theory, this was considered a fitting theme, but Alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would be commissioned for such works, so he was fired. It took several tries to agree on the current theme, \\"The March of Civilization\\", at which point some of the art had already been commissioned, including those which Alexander had proposed. The art that currently exists within Rockefeller Center was inspired by Professor Alexander's arts program. Sculptor Lee Lawrie contributed the largest number of individual pieces ‚Äì twelve, including the Atlas statue facing Fifth Avenue and the conspicuous friezes of Wisdom above the main entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Edward Trumbull coordinated the colors of the works located inside the buildings, and L√©on-Victor Solon did the same job for the exterior pieces. Isamu Noguchi's gleaming stainless steel bas-relief, News, over the main entrance to 50 Rockefeller Plaza (the Associated Press Building) was, at the time of commissioning, the largest metal bas-relief in the world. The complex's other sculptors included Rene Chambellan, Leo Friedlander, Robert Garrison, Alfred Janniot, Carl Paul Jennewein, Gaston Lachaise, Leo Lentelli, Paul Manship, Giacomo Manz√π, Hildreth Meiere, and Attilio Piccirilli. Other artists included Carl Milles, Margaret Bourke-White, and Dean Cornwell. Radio City Music Hall architect Donald Deskey commissioned many Depression-era artists to design works for the interior of the hall, including Stuart Davis's 1932 mural Men Without Women, named after the short story collection by Ernest Hemingway that had been published the same year.See: One of the center's more controversial works was Man at the Crossroads, created by Diego Rivera, which was originally commissioned for 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed. =Statues=Atlas Commissioned in 1936 and executed by Lee Lawrie and Rene Chambellan, the Atlas statue is located in the International Building's courtyard. It faces eastward toward St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The statue depicts Atlas the titan, with exaggerated muscles, supporting the celestial vault on his shoulders. Prometheus Paul Manship's highly recognizable bronze gilded Prometheus statue, commissioned in 1934, is located at the western end of the sunken plaza. It stands high and weighs . The statue depicts the Greek legend of the Titan Prometheus recumbent, bringing fire to mankind. The statue is flanked by two smaller gilded representations of Youth and Maiden, which were relocated to Palazzo d'Italia from 1939 to 1984 because Manship thought the representations did not fit visually. The model for Prometheus was Leonardo (Leon) Nole, and the inscription, a paraphrase from Aeschylus, on the granite wall behind, reads: \\"Prometheus, teacher in every art, brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends.\\" =Man at the Crossroads= Man, Controller of the Universe, a recreation of the destroyed Man at the Crossroads mural in 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobby In 1932, the Mexican socialist artist Diego Rivera (whose sponsor was the Museum of Modern Art and whose patron at the time was Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), was commissioned by their son Nelson to create a color fresco for the wall in the lobby of the then-RCA Building. This came after Nelson had been unable to secure the commissioning of either Matisse or Picasso. Previously Rivera had painted a controversial fresco in Detroit titled Detroit Industry, commissioned by Abby and John's friend, Edsel Ford, who later became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art. As expected, his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, which had not been apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln). As per Nelson's orders, Rivera was paid for his commission and the mural was papered over. Nine months later, after all attempts to save the fresco were explored‚Äîincluding relocating it to Abby's Museum of Modern Art‚Äîit was destroyed as a last option. (Rivera would later partially recreate the work as Man, Controller of the Universe, using photographs taken by an assistant, Lucienne Bloch.) Rivera's fresco in the Center was replaced with a larger mural by the Catalan artist Josep Maria Sert, titled American Progress, depicting a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America. Containing figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, it wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Grand Lobby. Critical review Rockefeller Center as depicted in a Lego Architecture model showing relationship of the buildings In its earliest years, Rockefeller Center received largely negative and pessimistic reviews from architectural critics. The most cynical opinion came from architectural scholar Lewis Mumford, who so hated the \\"weakly conceived, reckless, romantic chaos\\" of the March 1931 plans for Rockefeller Center that he reportedly went into exile in upstate New York. He blamed John Rockefeller Jr. for the complex's \\"inability to consider a new type of problem in any form except the skyscraper stereotype\\". Mumford's view of the complex was only marginally less negative when he revisited the issue in December 1933: he said that it could be \\"large, exciting, [and] romantic\\" at night, but that \\"a mountain or ash heap of the same size would do the trick almost as well, if the lights were cleverly arranged\\". Ralph Adams Cram, who adhered to a more classical architectural style, also had a pessimistic view of the plans unveiled in March 1931. He called the plan for Rockefeller Center \\"an apotheosis of megalomania, a defiant egotism\\" arising from an ostentatious display of wealth, and said that \\"the sooner we accomplish the destiny it so perfectly foreshadows, the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again\\". Douglas Haskell, who formerly edited Architectural Forum magazine, wrote that Rockefeller Center's ambiance was \\"gray, unreal, baleful\\". The urban planner Le Corbusier had a more optimistic view of the complex, expressing that Rockefeller Center was \\"rational, logically conceived, biologically normal, [and] harmonious\\". He wrote that although Rockefeller Center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years, it would eventually adhere to a certain \\"order\\", and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of \\"noble\\" and \\"efficient\\" construction. The writer Frederick Lewis Allen took a more moderate viewpoint, saying that negative critics had \\"hoped for too much\\" precisely because Rockefeller Center had been planned during an economically prosperous time, but was constructed during the Depression. Even though Allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted, he stated that Rockefeller Center had an aura of \\"festivity\\" around it, unlike most other office buildings in America. Sigfried Giedion wrote in his book Space, Time and Architecture that Rockefeller Center's design was akin to a \\"civic center\\" whose design represented the 1930s version of the future. Henry Luce, the founder of Time Inc., said in 1941 that Rockefeller Center represented \\"the true world of tomorrow\\", as opposed to the 1939 New York World's Fair, whose \\"World of Tomorrow\\" representations \\"are today junk piles under the winter snow\\". Novelist Gertrude Stein said in 1935, \\"The view of Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.\\" By the 1940s, most critics had positive views of Rockefeller Center. Even Mumford praised the complex, lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the United Nations on First Avenue had no \\"human scale\\" or \\"transition from the intimate to the monumental\\", whereas Rockefeller Center's buildings \\"produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size\\". Haskell wrote in 1966 that Rockefeller Center's designers \\"seemed to have regarded urban life as an enhanceable romance\\". In 1969, the art historian Vincent Scully wrote, \\"Rockefeller Center is one of the few surviving public spaces that look as if they were designed and used by people who knew what stable wealth was and were not ashamed to enjoy it.\\" The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation commissioned a report in 1974 entitled \\"Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center: A Historic-Critical Estimate of Their Significance\\", in which they concluded that Rockefeller Center, along with Central Park and Grand Central Terminal, were the only three developments that could slow down Manhattan's \\"remorseless process of expansion and decay\\". In 1976, New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote, \\"What makes Rockefeller Center work is that it is at once a formal Beaux‚ÄêArts‚Äêinfluenced complex of dignified towers and a lively, utterly contemporary amalgam of shops, plazas and street life. It is as natural a home for a 1970's street festival as for a 1930's movie about cafe society: few designs can join such disparate worlds so comfortably.\\" See also * Early skyscrapers * Architecture of New York City * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan from 59th to 110th Streets * National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan above 59th to 110th Streets  Notes  References = Citations  Sources = # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # Further reading  A more extensive list of sources can be found in ; ; ; and .

In the mid-1960s, he worked as both a record producer for Autumn Records and a disc jockey for San Francisco radio station KSOL. In 1966, Stone formed Sly & the Family Stone, among the first racially integrated, male and female acts in popular music. The group would score hits such as \\"Dance to the Music\\" (1968), \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" (1969) and \\"Family Affair\\" (1971) and acclaimed albums such as Stand! (1969) and There's a Riot Goin' On (1971). By the mid-1970s, Stone's drug problems and erratic behavior effectively ended the group, leaving him to record several unsuccessful solo albums. In 1993, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the group. Biography=Early life= The Stewart family was a deeply religious middle-class household from Denton, Texas. Born March 15, 1943,Santiago, Eddie. Sly: The Lives of Sylvester Stewart and Sly Stone. Eddie Santiago, 2008. Print. before the family had moved to Vallejo, California, in the North Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area, Sylvester was the second of the family's five children. As part of the doctrines of the Church of God in Christ (COGIC), to which the Stewart family belonged, the parents ‚Äì K.C and Alpha Stewart ‚Äì encouraged musical expression in the household.Selvin, Joel (1998). For the Record: Sly and the Family Stone: An Oral History. New York: Quill Publishing. . Sylvester and his brother Freddie along with their sisters Rose and Vaetta formed \\"The Stewart Four\\" as children, performing gospel music in the Church of God in Christ and even recording a single local release 78 rpm single, \\"On the Battlefield\\" b/w \\"Walking in Jesus' Name\\", in 1952. The eldest sister, Loretta, was the only Stewart child not to pursue a musical career. All of the other Stewart children would later adopt the surname \\"Stone\\" and become members of Sly & the Family Stone. Sylvester was identified as a musical prodigy. By the time he was seven, Sylvester had already become proficient on the keyboards, and by the age of eleven, he had mastered the guitar, bass, and drums as well. While still in high school, Sylvester had settled primarily on the guitar and joined a number of high school bands. One of these was the Viscaynes, a doo-wop group in which Sylvester and his friend Frank Arellano‚Äîwho was Filipino‚Äîwere the only non- white members. The fact that the group was integrated made the Viscaynes \\"hip\\" in the eyes of their audiences, and would later inspire Sylvester's idea of the multicultural Family Stone. The Viscaynes released a few local singles, including \\"Yellow Moon\\" and \\"Stop What You Are\\"; during the same period, Sylvester also recorded a few solo singles under the name Danny Stewart. With his brother, Fred, he formed several short-lived groups, like the Stewart Bros.\\"Sly & The Family Stone.\\" Rolling Stone. Web. The nickname Sly was a common one for Sylvester throughout his years in grade school. Early on, a classmate misspelled his name \\"Slyvester,\\" and ever since, the nickname followed him. In the mid-1960s, Stone worked as a disc jockey for San Francisco, California, soul radio station KSOL, where he included white performers such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones in his playlists. During the same period, he worked as a staff record producer for Autumn Records, producing for predominantly white San Francisco-area bands such as The Beau Brummels, The Mojo Men, Bobby Freeman, and Grace Slick's first band, The Great Society. Stone was influential in guiding KSOL-AM into soul music and started calling the station K-SOUL. The second was a popular soul music station (sans the K-SOUL moniker), at 107.7 FM (now known as KSAN). The current KSOL has a different format and is unrelated to the previous two stations. While still providing \\"music for your mind, body, and your soul\\" on KSOL, Sly Stone played keyboard for dozens of major performers including Dionne Warwick, Righteous Brothers, Ronettes, Bobby Freeman, George & Teddy, Freddy Cannon, Marvin Gaye, Dick & Dee Dee, Jan & Dean, Gene Chandler, and many more, including at least one of the three Twist Party concerts by then chart topper Chubby Checker held at the Cow Palace in San Francisco in 1962 and 1963. The concerts were put together by \\"Big Daddy\\" Tom Donohue and Bobby Mitchell from the then infamous KYA 1260 AM radio station and largely choreographed by Jerry Marcellino and Mel Larson who went on to produce many Motown artists including Michael Jackson, Diana Ross, and some of the top artists of the day. Adopting the stage name \\"Sly Stone,\\" he then formed \\"The Stoners\\" in 1966 which included Cynthia Robinson on trumpet. With her he started his next band, Sly and the Family Stone. Stone, Robinson, and Fred Stewart were joined by Larry Graham, Greg Errico, and Jerry Martini, all of whom had studied music and worked in numerous amateur groups. Working around the Bay Area in 1967, this multiracial band made a strong impression. On the first recordings Little Sister's Vet Stone, Mary McCreary, and Elva Mouton did backup vocals. In 1968 sister Rosie Stone (piano and vocals) joined the band. =Sly and the Family Stone's success= Along with James Brown and Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly and the Family Stone were pioneers of late 1960s and early '70s funk. Their fusion of R&B; rhythms, infectious melodies, and psychedelia created a new pop/soul/rock hybrid the impact of which has proven lasting and widespread. Motown producer Norman Whitfield, for example, patterned the label's forays into harder- driving, socially relevant material (such as The Temptations' \\"Runaway Child\\" and \\"Ball of Confusion\\") based on their sound. The pioneering precedent of Stone's racial, sexual, and stylistic mix, had a major influence in the 1980s on artists such as Prince and Rick James. Legions of artists from the 1990s forward ‚Äì including Public Enemy, Fatboy Slim, Beck, Beastie Boys and LL Cool J's popular \\"Mama Said Knock You Out\\" along with many others ‚Äì mined Stone's seminal back catalog for hook-laden samples. \\"The most talented musician I know is Sly Stone,\\" Bootsy Collins said in an interview with Mojo. \\"He's more talented than anybody I ever have seen ‚Äì he's amazing. I worked with him in Detroit from 1981 to '83, and to see him just fooling around, playing, jamming, is a whole other trip. He's the most amazing musician.\\" After a mildly received debut album, A Whole New Thing (1967), Sly & The Family Stone had their first hit single with \\"Dance to the Music\\", which was later included on an album of the same name (1968). Although their third album, Life (also 1968), also suffered from low sales, their fourth album, Stand! (1969), became a runaway success, selling over three million copies and spawning a number one hit single, \\"Everyday People\\". By the summer of 1969, Sly & The Family Stone were one of the biggest names in music, releasing two more top five singles, \\"Hot Fun in the Summertime\\" and \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" / \\"Everybody Is a Star\\", before the end of the year, and appearing at Woodstock. After the group began touring following the success of Dance to the Music, The Family Stone drew praise for their explosive live show, which attracted black and white fans in equal measure. When Bob Marley first played in the U.S. in 1973 with his band The Wailers, he opened on tour for Sly and The Family Stone. =Personal problems= With the band's newfound fame and success came numerous problems. Relationships within the band were deteriorating; there was friction in particular between the Stone brothers and Larry Graham.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 107, 146‚Äì152 Epic requested more marketable output.* Kaliss, Jeff (2008). I Want to Take You Higher: The Life and Times of Sly & the Family Stone. New York: Hal Leonard/Backbeat Books. . The Black Panther Party demanded that Stone make his music more militant and more reflective of the black power movement, replace Greg Errico and Jerry Martini with black instrumentalists, and replace manager David Kapralik.Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 89; interview with David Kapralik. After moving to the Los Angeles area in fall 1969, Stone and his bandmates became heavy users of illegal drugs, primarily cocaine and PCP.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 94‚Äì98 As the members became increasingly focused on drug use and partying (Stone carried a violin case filled with illegal drugs wherever he went),Selvin, Joel (1998), p. 122 recording slowed significantly. Between summer 1969 and fall 1971, the band released only one single, \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\"/\\"Everybody Is a Star\\", released in December 1969. The former song was one of the first recordings to employ the heavy, funky beats that would be featured in the funk music of the following decade. It showcased bass player Larry Graham's innovative percussive playing technique of bass \\"slapping\\". Graham later said that he developed this technique in an earlier band in order to compensate for that band's lack of a drummer.Bass Legend Graham Lays Down the Millennial Funk: Larry Graham. Rolling Stone. Retrieved October 25, 2008. \\"Thank You\\" reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1970. The single also peaked at No. 5 on the R&B; chart and remained there for five weeks, while also remaining at No. 1 on the Pop chart for two weeks in the spring of 1970, before selling over a million copies.[ allmusic: Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)]. All Media Guide, LLC. Retrieved October 25, 2008. Having relocated to Los Angeles with his then girlfriend Deborah King, later Deborah Santana (wife of Carlos Santana from 1973 until filing for divorce in 2007), Stone's behavior became increasingly erratic. Epic was anticipating new material in 1970, but with none forthcoming, finally released Greatest Hits that November. One year later, the band's fifth album, There's a Riot Goin' On, was released. Riot featured a much darker sound as most tracks were recorded with overdubbing as opposed to the Family Stone all playing at the same time as they had done previously. Stone played most of the parts himself and performed more of the lead vocals than usual. This was the first major label album to feature a drum machine. The band's cohesion slowly began to erode, and its sales and popularity began to decline as well. Errico withdrew from the group in 1971 and was eventually replaced with Andy Newmark. Larry Graham and Stone were no longer on friendly terms, and Graham was fired in early 1972 and replaced with Rustee Allen. The band's later releases, Fresh (1973) and Small Talk (1974), featured even less of the band and more of Stone. Live bookings for Sly & the Family Stone had steadily dropped since 1970, because promoters were afraid that Stone or one of the band members might miss the gig, refuse to play, or pass out from drug use.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 141‚Äì145 These issues were regular occurrences for the band during the 1970s, and had an adverse effect on their ability to demand money for live bookings. In 1970, 26 of 80 concerts were cancelled, and numerous others started late. At many of these gigs, concertgoers rioted if the band failed to show up, or if Stone walked out before finishing his set. Ken Roberts became the group's promoter, and later their general manager, when no other representatives would work with the band because of their erratic gig attendance record.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 186‚Äì189. In January 1975, the band booked itself at Radio City Music Hall in New York. The famed music hall was only one-eighth occupied, and Stone and company had to scrape together money to return home.Selvin, Joel (1998), pp. 188‚Äì191. Following the Radio City engagement, the band was dissolved. Rose Stone was pulled out of the band by Bubba Banks, who was by then her husband. She began a solo career, recording a Motown-style album under the name Rose Banks in 1976. Freddie Stone joined Larry Graham's group, Graham Central Station, for a time; after collaborating with his brother one last time in 1979 for Back on the Right Track, he retired from the music industry and eventually became the pastor of the Evangelist Temple Fellowship Center in Vallejo, California. Little Sister was also dissolved; Mary McCreary married Leon Russell and released recordings on Russell's Shelter Records label.Ankeny, Jason. \\"[ Leon Russell]\\". Allmusic.

Retrieved February 5, 2007. =Later years= Stone went on to record four more albums as a solo artist (only High on You (1975) was released under just his name; the other three were released under the \\"Sly & The Family Stone\\" name). In 1976, Stone assembled a new Family Stone and released Heard Ya Missed Me, Well I'm Back. 1979's Back on the Right Track followed, and in 1982 Ain't But the One Way was released, which began as a collaborative album with George Clinton, but was scrapped and later completed by producer Stewart Levine for release. None of these later albums achieved much success. Stone also collaborated with Funkadelic on The Electric Spanking of War Babies (1981), but was unable to reinvigorate his career. In the early 1980s Sly Stone was also part of a George Clinton/Funkadelic family project with Muruga Booker called \\"The Soda Jerks,\\" who recorded an album worth of material, of which only one song has been released. However, Muruga still has plans to release the material from the project. In June 1983, Stone was arrested and charged with cocaine possession in Fort Myers, Florida. Stone managed to do a short tour with Bobby Womack in the summer of 1984, and he continued to make sporadic appearances on compilations and other artists' records. In 1986, Stone was featured on a track from Jesse Johnson's album Shockadelica called \\"Crazay\\". The music video featured Stone on keyboards and vocals, and received some airplay on the BET music network. In 1987, Stone released a single, \\"Eek- a-Boo Static Automatic\\", from the Soul Man soundtrack, and the song \\"I'm the Burglar\\" from the Burglar soundtrack. He also co-wrote and co-produced \\"Just Like A Teeter-Totter,\\" which appeared on a Bar-Kays album from 1989. From 1988 to 1989 Sly Stone wrote and produced a collection of unreleased recordings in his home studio in New Jersey, \\"Coming Back for More\\" and \\"Just Like A Teeter- Totter\\" are a part of that collection of about 20 songs. In 1990, he gave an energetic vocal performance on the Earth, Wind and Fire song, \\"Good Time.\\" In 1991, he appeared on a cover of \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\" performed by the Japanese band 13CATS, and shared lead vocals with Bobby Womack on \\"When the Weekend Comes\\" from Womack's 1993 album I Still Love You. In 1992, Sly and the Family Stone appeared on the Red Hot Organization's dance compilation album, Red Hot + Dance, contributing an original track,\\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin) (Todds CD Mix).\\" The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities. In 1995, ex-landlord Chase Mellon III accused Stone of trashing the Beverly Hills mansion Mellon rented to him in 1993. Mellon says that he found bathrooms smeared with gold paint, marble floors blackened, windows broken and a gaunt Stone emerging from a guest house to say, \\"You‚Äôre spying on me.\\" Sly Jr., then studying to be a recording engineer, told People, \\"Nobody purposely destroyed the house. I‚Äôd thrown parties. My dad had a few get-togethers. We weren't aware of the damage.\\" The damage, however, was not just superficial. \\"Sly never grew out of drugs,\\" says ex-wife Silva. \\"He lost his backbone and destroyed his future.\\" His last major public appearance until 2006 was during the 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony where Stone showed up onstage to be entered into the Hall of Fame along with the Family Stone. In 2003, the other six members of the original Family Stone entered the studio to record a new album. Stone was invited to participate, but declined. \\"I feel like Sly just doesn't wanna deal with it no more,\\" Bootsy Collins told Mojo. \\"It's like he's had it ‚Äì it ain't no fun no more. It's a curse and a blessing. The curse part of it is the business you have to deal with, and then the blessing part is you get to be a musician and have fun‚Ä¶\\" A few home-studio recordings (most likely from the late 1980s) with Stone's voice and keyboards over a drum machine have made their way onto a bootleg. One Stone-penned demo called \\"Coming Back for More\\" appears to be autobiographical and includes the verse: \\"Been so high, I touched the sky and the sky says 'Sly, why you tryin' to get by?' Comin' back for more.\\" His son, Sylvester Stewart Jr., told People Magazine in 1997 that his father had composed an album's worth of material, including a tribute to Miles Davis called \\"Miles and Miles.\\" On August 15, 2005, Stone drove his younger sister Vet Stone on his motorcycle to Los Angeles' Knitting Factory, where Vet was performing with her Sly & the Family Stone tribute band, the Phunk Phamily Affair. Stone kept his helmet on during the entire performance, and was described by one concertgoer as looking a little like Bootsy Collins. A film crew doing a documentary on Sly & the Family Stone, later released as On the Sly: In Search of the Family Stone, was at the show and captured this rare sighting on film. Stone, according to his web site, is producing and writing material for the group's new album. In addition, Stone renamed the group \\"Family Stone.\\" In 2009, the documentary film Coming Back for More detailed his dire financial situation. Stone filed suit against Jerry Goldstein, the former manager of Sly and the Family Stone for $50 million in January 2010. The litigation claimed that Goldstein had used fraudulent practices to convince him to deliver the rights to his songs to Goldstein. In the suit, he made the same claim about the Sly and the Family Stone trademark.The Detroit Free Press, January 30, 2010, page 11A Goldstein filed a countersuit for slander following a rant by Stone at the Coachella Festival. In January 2015, a Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of Stone, awarding him $5 million. However, in December 2015, a superior court judge ruled that Stone would not be able to collect the royalties because he had previously assigned them to a production company. On August 16, 2011, the album I'm Back! Family & Friends was released. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly and the Family Stone's greatest hits with guest appearances from Jeff Beck, Ray Manzarek, Bootsy Collins, Ann Wilson, Carmine Appice, and Johnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs. One month later, on September 25, 2011, the New York Post reported that Sly Stone was now homeless and living out of a white camper-van in Los Angeles: \\"The van is parked on a residential street in Crenshaw, the rough Los Angeles neighborhood where Boyz n the Hood was set. A retired couple makes sure he eats once a day, and Stone showers at their house.\\" =Mid 2000s tributes= A Sly and the Family Stone tribute took place at the 2006 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2006, at which Stone gave his first live musical performance since 1987. Sly and the original Family Stone lineup (minus Larry Graham) performed briefly during a tribute to the band, for which the headliners included Steven Tyler, John Legend, Van Hunt, Nile Rodgers and Robert Randolph. Sporting an enormous blonde mohawk, thick sunglasses, a \\"Sly\\" beltbuckle and a silver lam√© suit, he joined in on \\"I Want To Take You Higher.\\" Hunched over the keyboards, he wore a cast on his right hand (the result of a recent motorcycle mishap), and a hunched back caused him to look down through most of the performance. His voice, though strong, was barely audible over the production. Stone walked to the front of the stage toward the end of the performance, sang a verse and then with a wave to the audience, sauntered offstage before the song was over. \\"He went up the ramp [outside the theater], got on a motorcycle and took off,\\" Ken Ehrlich, executive producer of the Grammy Awards show told the Chicago Sun-Times. Ehrlich said Stone refused to leave his hotel room until he was given a police escort to the show and then waited in his car until the performance began. A Sly and the Family Stone tribute album, Different Strokes by Different Folks, was released on July 12, 2005 by Starbucks' Hear Music label, and on February 7, 2006 by Epic Records. The project features both cover versions of the band's songs and songs which sample the original recordings. Among the artists for the set are The Roots (\\"Star\\", which samples \\"Everybody is a Star\\"), Maroon 5 and Ciara (\\"Everyday People\\"), John Legend, Joss Stone and Van Hunt (\\"Family Affair\\"), The Black Eyed Peas' will.i.am (\\"Dance to the Music\\"), and Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, and Robert Randolph (\\"I Want to Take You Higher\\"). Epic Records' version of the tribute album, which included two additional covers (\\"Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey\\" and \\"Thank You (Falletinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\") was released in January 2006. =Re-emergence= On Sunday, January 14, 2007 Stone made a short guest appearance at a show of The New Family Stone band he supports at the House of Blues. On April 1, 2007, Stone appeared with the Family Stone at the Flamingo Las Vegas Showroom, after George Wallace's standup act. On July 7, 2007 Stone made a short appearance with the Family Stone at the San Jose Summerfest. He sang \\"Sing a Simple Song\\" and \\"If You Want Me to Stay,\\" and walked off stage before the end of \\"Higher\\". Stone cut the set short, in part, because the band began their set over 90 minutes late and had to finish before a certain time. While many blamed Stone for this incident, others believed that the promoter was at fault. The same scenes were repeated at the Montreux Jazz Festival on July 13, 2007 with over half the sold-out venue walking out in disgust even earlier than his stage exit. The same happened again one day later at the Blue Note Records Festival in Ghent, Belgium. There he left the stage after saying to the audience that \\"when waking up this morning he realized he was old, and so he needed to take a break now\\". He did the same again one day later, performing at the North Sea Jazz Festival. Stone in 2007. As the tour progressed, however, Stone seemed to be more confident and animated, often dancing and engaging the audience. He performed \\"Stand\\", \\"I Want To Take You Higher\\", \\"Sing A Simple Song\\", \\"If You Want Me To Stay\\", and \\"Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)\\", which at one point morphed into \\"Thank you For Talkin' To Me Africa\\", a track rarely performed in public. But the show was marred by sound problems and the vocals were barely audible through much of the show. On October 17, 2008, Sly played with the Family Stone at the Wells Fargo Center for the Arts in Santa Rosa, CA. He played a 22-minute set and ventured offstage, telling the crowd \\"I gotta go take a piss. I'll be right back.\\" He never returned. On Memorial Day, May 25, 2009, Stone re-emerged once again, granting an hour-long interview with KCRW-FM, a Los Angeles NPR affiliate, to discuss his life and career. On August 18, 2009, The Guardian reported that a forthcoming documentary, Coming Back for More by Dutch director Willem Alkema, claims Stone is homeless and living off welfare while staying in cheap hotels and a camper van. The film alleges that Stone's former manager, Jerry Goldstein, cut off his access to royalty payments following a dispute over a 'debt agreement', forcing Stone to depend on welfare payments. On September 25, 2011, Alkema wrote in the New York Post that Stone was homeless and living in a van in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles, although a subsequent report by Roger Friedman of Showbiz411 stated that Stone is not homeless, and lives in the van by choice. On Labor Day, September 7, 2009, Stone appeared at the 20th annual African Festival of the Arts in Chicago, Ill. He performed a 15-minute set during George Clinton's performance. He performed his popular hits along with George Clinton's band. He left immediately after his short performance. On December 6, 2009, Stone signed a new recording contract with the LA-based Cleopatra Records and on August 16, 2011, I'm Back! Family & Friends was released, his first album since 1982's Ain't But the One Way. The album features re-recorded versions of Sly & the Family Stone hits with guest appearances from Jeff Beck, Ray Manzarek, Bootsy Collins, Ann Wilson, Carmine Appice and Johnny Winter, as well as three previously unreleased songs. Stone has appeared in later years with George Clinton and performed with his daughter Novena's band, Baby Stone. In Jan 2015, Sly Stone along with four of his bandmates appeared at a convention dedicated to honoring the band and its legacy. Called LOVE CITY CONVENTION it occurred in Oakland at the Den Lounge inside the Fox Oakland Theater. Sly was in good spirits, answered questions from fans and signed autographs. Stone sued his former managers in 2010, accusing them of cheating him out of years' worth of royalty payments for the songs he had written. He testified that he had not been paid any royalties between 1989 and 2009. A jury in Los Angeles awarded him $5 million in damages in January 2015, but in December the award was overturned because, the appellate court ruled, the trial judge had not told the jury to take into account the fact Stone had assigned his royalties to a production company in exchange for a 50% ownership stake. In May 2016, Stone's attorneys appealed that decision. Personal life Stone married model-actress Kathy Silva on June 5, 1974 during a sold- out performance at Madison Square Garden. Their outfits were designed by Halston. They made elaborate plans for a laser-light show, a real-life \\"angel\\" flying on wires dropping gold glitter all over the crowd, and for thousands of doves to be released. The ASPCA threatened a lawsuit, which kept the doves from flying, and the Garden wouldn't let the human \\"angel\\" fly unless Stone and company posted a $125,000 security bond. They declined to pay the fee, and also opted not to pay for the 200 extra security guards the venue demanded in order to allow the wedding party to stage a processional right through the audience. They separated in 1976 after their son was mauled by Stone's dog. Silva later told People magazine. \\"I didn't want that world of drugs and weirdness.\\" Still, she remembers, \\"He'd write me a song or promise to change, and I'd try again. We were always fighting, then getting back together.\\" =Children= Sylvester Jr., born late 1973. His mother is Kathy Silva. Sylvyette, born c. 1976. Her mother was Cynthia Robinson (1944‚Äì2015). Novena Carmel, born c. 1982. She is a singer and performer and also a booking agent at the Little Temple club in Los Angeles, now known as The Virgil. She is also a member of pop/hip hop group Wallpaper. =Family= Stone's cousin is Moses Tyson, Jr., who is a gospel musician and organist.

It contrasts with circulating capital such as raw materials, operating expenses and the like. It was first theoretically analyzed in some depth by the economist David Ricardo. Thus fixed capital is that portion of the total capital outlay that is invested in fixed assets (such as land improvements, buildings, vehicles, plant and equipment), that stay in the business almost permanently‚Äîor at the very least, for more than one accounting period. Fixed assets can be purchased by a business, in which case the business owns them. They can also be leased, hired or rented, if that is cheaper or more convenient, or if owning the fixed asset is practically impossible (for legal or technical reasons). Refining the classical distinction between fixed and circulating capital in Das Kapital, Karl Marx emphasizes that the distinction is really purely relative, i.e. it refers only to the comparative rotation speeds (turnover time) of different types of physical capital assets. Fixed capital also \\"circulates\\", except that the circulation time is much longer, because a fixed asset may be held for 5, 10 or 20 years before it has yielded its value and is discarded for its salvage value. A fixed asset may also be resold and re-used, which often happens with vehicles and planes. In national accounts, fixed capital is conventionally defined as the stock of tangible, durable fixed assets owned or used by resident enterprises for more than one year. This includes plant, machinery, vehicles and equipment, installations and physical infrastructures, the value of land improvements, and buildings. The European system of national and regional accounts (ESA95) explicitly includes produced intangible assets (e.g. mineral exploitation, computer software, copyright protected entertainment, literary and artistics originals) within the definition of fixed assets. Land itself is not included in the statistical concept of fixed capital, even though it is a fixed asset. The main reason is that land is not regarded as a product (a reproducible good). But the value of land improvements is included in the statistical concept of fixed capital, being regarded as the creation of value-added through production. Estimating the value Attempts have been made to estimate the value of the stock of fixed capital for the whole economy using direct enterprise surveys of \\"book value\\", administrative business records, tax assessments, and data on gross fixed capital formation, price inflation and depreciation schedules. A pioneer in this area was the economist Simon Kuznets. Simon Kuznets, Gross capital formation, 1919-1933. New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1934. The so-called \\"perpetual inventory method\\" (PIM) used to estimate fixed capital stocks was invented by Raymond W. Goldsmith in 1951 and subsequently used around the world.Raymond W. Goldsmith, A Perpetual Inventory of National Wealth. Studies in Income and Wealth, Vol. 14. New York: NBER, 1951, pp. 5-74. The basic idea of the PIM method is, that one starts off from a benchmark asset figure, and adds on the net additions to fixed assets year by year (using gross fixed capital formation data), while deducting annual depreciation, all data being adjusted for price inflation using a capital expenditure price index. In this way, one obtains a time series of annual fixed capital stocks. This data series can also be modified further with various other adjustments for prices, asset lifetimes etc. (several variants of the PIM approach are nowadays used by economic historians and statisticians). However, it is widely acknowledged that it is extremely difficult to obtain any accurate measurement of the value of fixed capital, especially because even the owner himself or herself may not know what the assets are currently \\"worth\\". What they are worth may become apparent only at the point where they are definitely sold for a price. Some valuations for fixed assets may refer to historic cost (acquisition cost) or book value, others to current replacement cost, current sale value in the market, or scrap value. The depreciation write-off permitted for tax purposes may also diverge from so-called \\"economic depreciation\\" or \\"real\\" depreciation rates. Economic depreciation rates are calculated on the basis of the observed average market prices that depreciated assets at different ages actually sell for. Sometimes statisticians try to estimate the average \\"service lives\\" of fixed assets as a basis for calculating depreciation and scrap values, based on the observed length of time that fixed assets are actually held and used by their owners who own the business. Almost always, the capital stock estimate which statisticians arrive at is a theoretical estimate based on a variety of data sources, and it does not correspond to the historical cost of fixed assets nor to actual depreciation write-offs. However, it is believed to be a more accurate representation of the true value of the fixed capital stock. Investment risk A business executive who invests in or accumulates fixed capital is tying up wealth in a fixed asset, hoping to make a future profit. Thus, such an investment usually implies a risk. Sometimes depreciation write- offs are also viewed partly as a compensation for this risk. Often leasing or renting a fixed asset (such as a vehicle) rather than buying it is preferred by enterprises because the cost of using it is lowered thereby, and the real owner may be able to obtain special tax advantages. Sources of funding for fixed capital investment An owner can obtain funding for purchase of fixed capital assets from the aptly named capital market, where loans are given on a long-term basis. Funding can also come from reserve funds, the selling of shares, and the issuing of debentures, bonds or other promissory notes. Factors which influence fixed-capital requirements *The nature of the undertaking: the nature of the business certainly plays a role in determining fixed capital requirements. A florist, for example, needs less fixed capital than a vehicle-assembly factory. * The size of the undertaking: a general rule applies: the bigger the business, the higher the need for fixed capital. * The stage of development of the undertaking: the requirement of capital for a new undertaking is usually greater than that needed for an established business that has reached optimum size.

Paintballs are usually shot using low-energy air weapons called paintball markers that are powered by compressed air (nitrogen) or carbon dioxide and were originally designed for remotely marking trees and cattle. The game was initially developed in May 1981 in New Hampshire by Hayes Noel, a Wall Street stock trader, and Charles Gaines, an outdoorsman and writer. A debate arose between them about whether a city- dweller had the instinct to survive in the woods against a man who had spent his youth hunting, fishing, and building cabins. The two men chanced upon an advertisement for a paint gun in a farm catalogue and were inspired to use it to settle their argument with 10 other men all in individual competition, eventually creating the sport of paintball. The sport is played for recreation and is also played at a formal sporting level with organized competition that involves major tournaments, professional teams, and players. Paintball technology is also used by military forces, law enforcement, paramilitary, and security organizations to supplement military or other training. Games can be played on indoor or outdoor fields of varying sizes. A playing field may have natural or artificial terrain which players use for tactical cover. Game types and goals vary, but include capture the flag, elimination, defending or attacking a particular point or area, or capturing objects of interest hidden in the playing area. Depending on the variant played, games can last from minutes to hours, or even days in \\"scenario play\\". The legality of the sport and use of paintball markers varies among countries and regions. In most areas where regulated play is offered, players are required to wear protective masks, use barrel-blocking safety equipment, and strictly enforce safe game rules. Equipment Players with woodsball equipment The paintball equipment used may depend on the game type, for example: woodsball, speedball, or scenario; on how much money one is willing to spend on equipment; and personal preference. However, almost every player will utilize three basic pieces of equipment: * Paintball marker: also known as a \\"paintball gun\\", this is the primary piece of equipment, used to mark the opposing player with paintballs. The paintball gun must have a loader or \\"hopper\\" or magazines attached to feed paint into the marker, and will be either spring-fed, gravity-fed (where balls drop into the loading chamber), or electronically force-fed. Modern markers require a compressed air tank or CO2 tank. In contrast, very early bolt-action paintball markers used disposable silver capsules ( CO2 cartridges) normally seen in pellet guns. In the mid to late 1980s, marker mechanics improved to include constant air pressure and semi-automatic operation. Further improvements included increased rates of fire; carbon dioxide (CO2) tanks from 100 to 1,180 ml (3.5 to 40 US fluid ounces), and compressed-air or nitrogen tanks in a variety of sizes and pressure capacities up to 34,000 kPa (5,000 psi). The use of unstable CO2 causes damage to the low-pressure pneumatic components inside electronic markers, therefore the more stable compressed air is preferred by owners of such markers. * Paintballs (pellets): Paintballs, the ammunition used in the marker, are spherical gelatin capsules containing primarily polyethylene glycol, other non-toxic and water-soluble substances, and dye. The quality of paintballs is dependent on the brittleness of the ball's shell, the roundness of the sphere, and the thickness of the fill; higher-quality balls are almost perfectly spherical, with a very thin shell to guarantee breaking upon impact, and a thick, brightly colored fill that is difficult to hide or wipe off during the game. The highest-grade paintballs incorporate cornstarch and metallic flake into the fill to leave a thick glittery \\"splat\\" that is very obvious against any background color, and hard to wipe off. Almost all paintballs in use today are biodegradeable. All ingredients used in the making of a paintball are food-grade quality and are harmless to the participants and environment. Manufacturers and distributors have been making the effort to move away from the traditional oil-based paints and compressed CO2 gas propellant, to a more friendly water-based formula and compressed air in an effort to become more \\"eco-friendly\\". Paintballs come in a variety of sizes, including of 13mm (0.50 in) and 17mm (0.68 in). * Mask or goggles: Masks are safety devices players are required to wear at all times on the field, to protect them from paintballs. The original equipment used by players were safety goggles of the type used in labs and wood shops; today's goggles are derived from skiing/snowboarding goggles, with an attached shell that completely covers the eyes, mouth, ears and nostrils of the wearer. Masks can also feature throat guards. Modern masks have developed to be less bulky compared with older designs. Some players may remove the mouth and/or ear protection for aesthetic or comfort reasons, but this is neither recommended nor often allowed at commercial venues. A good paintball mask will protect the eyes from vision distortion caused by fogging, glare, and scratches. Players who do not wear a paintball masks can be hurt badly. Additional equipment, commonly seen among frequent players, tournament participants, and professional players include: * Pods and pod packs: The most common addition to the above \\"mandatory\\" equipment, pods are plastic containers, usually with flip-open lids, that store paintballs in a ready-to-use manner. Pods are available in many sizes, including 10, 80, 100 and 140-round sizes, with the larger 140-round pods being most common among tournament players. Pods are carried by the player in pod packs or harnesses which facilitate easy access to the pods during play. There are several designs of pod packs, from belt loops allowing a recreational player to carry one or two extra pods, to harness designs generally designed for either tournament-style or scenario- style players. * Squeegee/swab ‚Äì From time to time, a paintball will break inside the player's marker. When this happens it coats the inner surfaces of the marker with paint, especially the barrel, which considerably reduces accuracy. While speedball and tournament players generally have no time to clear this obstruction and instead simply \\"shoot through it\\", woodsball and scenario players generally carry a tool to allow them to clear the barrel following a break. There are several types of squeegee, most of which are advantageous in two of three areas and disadvantageous in the last: cleaning time, effectiveness, and storage space. * Paintball jerseys and pants: Originally derived from motocross and BMX attire, tournament players commonly wear special outer clothing with integrated padding that allows the player a free range of motion, and helps protect the player both from paintball hits and from incidental contact with rocks and hard ground. Certain designs of jersey and pant even advertise lower incidence of hits, due to increased \\"bounce-offs\\" and \\"breakaways\\". In indoor fields, where shooting generally happens at very close range, hard-shelled armor is sometimes worn to protect the player from bruising and welts from close-range hits. * Elbow and knee pads: Common among outdoor sports, players can choose to help protect knee, elbow and even hip joints from jarring impact with the use of pads. For paintball, these pads are generally soft foam worn inside a player's pants to prevent abrasion of the pad against the ground. * Gloves: Paintball impacts to the hands, knuckles and fingers can be extremely painful and temporarily debilitating. In addition, this being an outdoor sport, players are often prone or crawling which can cause scrapes to the hands. Padded or armored gloves help reduce the potential for injury to the hands from these things. * Athletic supporter: Also called a jockstrap with cup pocket and protective cup. Also common in other sports involving potential impact of fast-moving objects, players generally take care to protect sensitive or vulnerable anatomical areas from painful hits and injury; men commonly wear an athletic supporter with a rigid cup similar to types used in cricket, American football, lacrosse, hockey or baseball, while women often wear a pelvic protector and a padded or hard-shelled sports bra also commonly seen in the aforementioned sports. * Other paint marking equipment: Normally seen in scenario play only, and disallowed at all tournaments, other forms of paint- marking equipment are sold, such as paint-grenades (paint-filled balloons or lengths of surgical hose). * Vehicles: Again normally only seen in scenario play, a variety of vehicles have been devised based on go-karts, pickup trucks, ATVs, small off-road vehicles, etc. to create \\"armored vehicles\\", within which players are protected from hits and can move around on the field. Such vehicles may employ a wide range of mounted paint-discharging weaponry. * Hats/Toques/Bandanas: Commonly worn by all levels of players to protect the forehead from direct paintball hits, and stop sweat from running down in to the mask. * Remote lines: Used to increase maneuverability, a remote line is a high- pressure hose connecting the fuel tank to the marker allowing the tank to be stored in a backpack or harness. It is mostly found in Mil-Sim, woodsball and scenario events. * Cell phone: A common piece of equipment. Players are increasingly live streaming their game play to services such as Twitch.  Gameplay  Paintball is played with a potentially limitless variety of rules and variations, which are specified before the game begins. The most basic game rule is that players must attempt to accomplish a goal without being shot and marked with a paintball. A variety of different rules govern the legality of a hit, ranging from \\"anything counts\\" (hits cause elimination whether the paintball broke and left a mark or not) to the most common variation: the paintball must break and leave a mark the size of a US quarter or larger. Eliminated players are expected to leave the field of play; eliminations may also earn the opposing team points. Depending on the agreed upon game rules, the player may return to the field and continue playing, or is eliminated from the game completely. The particular goal of the game is determined before play begins; examples include capture the flag and elimination. Paintball has spawned popular variants, including woodsball, which is played in the natural environment and spans across a large area. Conversely, the variant of speedball is played on a smaller field and has a very fast pace with games as brief as two minutes fifteen seconds in the (NSL) or lasting up to twenty minutes in the PSP (Paintball Sports Promotions). Another variant is scenario paintball, in which players attempt to recreate historical, or fictional settings. = Tournament = Tournaments are skill based competitions. These are often bracket tournaments with 5 person teams, taking place on Speedball (paintball) fields. Tournaments such as the NXL hold different events throughout the summer months all over the United States with a range of skill divisions. Other series such as the Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL) play tournaments with large teams on large wooded fields. The types of tournaments and applicable skill divisions vary wildly to serve the diverse interest of paintball competitors. = Speedball = Speedball is played in an open field that could be compared to a soccer field, it is flat with a minimum of natural obstacles, and sometimes artificial turf is used, especially in indoor fields. The first speedball fields were constructed with flat wooden obstacles staked into the ground to provide cover; this concept was further developed into a number of urban-scenario field styles with larger building- like obstacles for casual play, but speedball itself progressed to using smaller obstacles made from plastic drainage pipe, which offered a more variable field layout and some \\"give\\" to the obstacles for increased safety. Eventually, inflatable fabric \\"bunkers\\" were developed based on common obstacle shapes from previous fields, such as \\"snake\\" and \\"can\\" bunkers. The use of inflatable obstacles both increases player safety by reducing potential injury from collisions with obstacles, and allows them to be easily moved to reconfigure the field or to set up temporary fields. = Woodsball = Woodsball, or \\"Bushball\\", is a fairly recent term that refers to what was the original form of the game: teams competing in a wooded or natural environment, in which varying amounts of stealth and concealment tactics can offer an advantage. The term is commonly used as a synonym for specialized scenario- based play, but it technically refers to virtually any form of paintball played in fields primarily composed of natural terrain and cover such as trees and berms, instead of manmade obstacles. Usually the gamemode is TDM (aka team death match) although some times it is capture the flag, or protect the president. = Scenario = Commonly referred to as \\"Big Games\\" or \\"Scenario Games\\". \\"Big Games\\" refer to territory control based gameplay, while a \\"Paintball Scenario\\" refers to a game where tasks are given to each side at timed intervals. Pioneered by Wayne Dollack, \\"Scenario Paintball\\" focus much more heavily on Live Action Roleplaying events, elevating their immersion, storyline, and game play mechanics above the paintball aspect of play. Many variations and combinations of these games are currently played and are unique to each event and event producer. The game uses the entire venue it is at, combining all normal gaming fields into 1 large playing area. Popular examples of the scenario format are Cousin's Big Game in Coram, New York (on Long Island), Hell Survivor's Monster Game (just outside Pinckney, Michigan), Invasion of Normandy at Skirmish U.S.A in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma D-Day (in Wyandotte, Oklahoma), Fight For Asylum at PRZ Paintball (Picton, Ontario), Battle Royale at Flag Raiders Paintball (Kitchener, Ontario), the Sherwood Classic at Sherwood Forest (La Porte, Indiana), and Free Finale at Low Country Paintball (Ludowici, GA) events which draws in 100 to 5000 players and run at least 6 hours of uninterrupted play, most often averaging 12 hours of play in 2 days. \\"True24\\" scenario events run at least 24 hours continuously, the most recent one taking place in May 2019 at Sherwood Forest. These formats vary widely and are frequently historical MilSim, movie, or pop culture themed. = MilSim = MilSim (\\"Military Simulation\\") is a mode of play designed to create an experience closer to military reality, where the attainment of specific objectives is the most important aspect of the game. MilSim addresses the logistics of combat, mission planning and execution, and dealing with limited resources and ammunition. Players are typically eliminated from the game when struck by paint just like in any traditional game of paintball. MilSim is a popular gamemode also played in Airsoft, which is a similar sport to paintball. With the advent of shaped projectiles, such as the First Strike, and the resulting development of magazine fed markers, a considerable increase in range, accuracy and MILSIM realism was gained. Functionally speaking, magazine-fed markers are no different than any other paintball marker, with one exception. Instead of paintballs being gravity fed from a bulky hopper, which sits above the marker, shaped projectiles (or paintballs) are fed from a spring-loaded magazine from the bottom of the marker. The caliber of both the gravity fed and magazine fed markers are the same (.68 caliber) and the velocities are also generally the same. The increased range and accuracy of the shaped projectile comes from the higher ballistic coefficient that the shaped projectile has, and the gyroscopic spin imparted onto the projectile from a rifled barrel and fins on the projectile itself. Magazine fed markers and shaped projectiles have allowed marker designs to more closely approximate the styling and functionality of actual (real steel) firearms, which in turn has given paintball a better avenue to compete with Airsoft in the MilSiM environment. = MFOG = Mag-Fed Only Game. An increasingly popular style of game play that forbids bulk loading devices such as the traditional paintball \\"hopper\\" or \\"loader\\" and under or back mounted bulk loaders such as the Dye BoxRotor, Maxxloader backpack, and AGD Warp Feed. In this style of play all markers must accept a magazine, greatly limiting paint capacities and creating a type of paintball much more similar to popular First Person Shooter video games. = eSport Paintball = A type of paintball where each participant uses a smartphone to interact with the event they are playing. A mobile app and massively multiplayer gaming server is used to connect players and staff to the game and provide access to a variety of features. These include live scoreboards, Voice Over IP communications, location sharing and mapping, Augmented Reality interactivity, player statistics, AI assistants, and much more. = Time Trials = A single player paintball attraction in which participants move through a closed course and shoot at a succession of targets. Runs are timed and competition among players is through a leader board, competing to be the quickest. = Zombie Hunt = A static or mobile entertainment attraction. Venue staff are padded up and dressed as zombies. Paintball markers are mounted to a flat bed trailer. Participants are taken on a \\"Haunted Hay Ride\\" style attraction, towed through the property, where they defend themselves from the zombie hordes with paintballs. = Enforcement of game rules = Regulated games are overseen by referees or marshals, who patrol the course to ensure enforcement of the rules and the safety of the players. If a player is marked with paint, they will call them out, but competitors may also be expected to follow the honor code; a broken ball means elimination. Field operators may specify variations to this rule, such as requiring a tag to certain body locations only ‚Äì such as the head and torso only. There are game rules that can be enforced depending on the venue, to ensure safety, balance the fairness of the game or eliminate cheating. * Masks On Even when a game isn't in progress, virtually all venues enforce a masks-on rule while players are within the playing area. More generally, within any given area of the park, either all players'/spectators'/officials' masks must be on, or all players' markers must either have a barrel block in place or be disconnected from their gas source, to ensure that a paintball cannot be fired from any nearby marker and cause eye injury. Some fields encourage players to aim away from opponents' heads during play if possible; splatter from mask hits can penetrate ventilation holes in the goggles and cause eye irritation, close-range hits to the mask can cause improperly maintained lenses to fail, and hits to unprotected areas of the face, head and neck are especially painful and can cause more serious injury.Paintball Shooting Tactics at ExtremeSports101 - Getting a head shot looks cool and because there‚Äôs so much hard surface, there‚Äôs a good chance that the paint will break. However, there are definite downsides to going for an opponent‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also a good chance that the player will end up eating some paint or - worse yet - get hit in the neck, which is quite painful. If players don‚Äôt change their lenses as often as they should (and few players do!), a hit to the lenses may cause them to break. * Minimum distance ‚Äì When being tagged, depending on the distance from where the shot was fired, a direct paintball impact commonly causes bruises. In certain areas and at close range, these impacts may leave welts, or even break the skin and cause bleeding. To decrease these risks and the severity of associated injuries, commercial venues may enforce a minimum distance, such as , within which players cannot shoot an opponent. Many fields enforce a modified minimum distance surrender rule; a player who advances to within minimum range must offer his opponent the chance to surrender before shooting. This generally prevents injury and discord at recreational games, however it is seldom used in tournaments as it confers a real disadvantage to the attacking player; he must hesitate while his opponent is free to shoot immediately. The act of shooting a player at close range is colloquially called \\"bunkering\\"; it happens most often when a player uses covering fire to force his opponent behind the cover of a bunker, then advances on that bunker while still shooting to eliminate the opponent point-blank. A tap of the targeted player with the barrel of a marker, sometimes called a \\"barrel tag\\", \\"Murphy\\" or \\"tap-out\\", is generally considered equivalent to marking them with a paintball and is sometimes used in situations where one player is able to sneak up on an opponent to point-blank range. * Hits - A player is hit if a paintball leaves a solid mark of a specified minimum size (often nickel- or quarter-sized) anywhere on the player's body or equipment. Some variations of paintball don't count hits to the gun or the pod pack, or require multiple hits on the arms or legs. Most professional fields and tournaments, though, count any hit on a person, the equipment on his person, or even objects picked up at random from the field. A grey area of \\"splatter\\" often occurs when a paintball breaks on a nearby surface and that paint deflects onto the player; this usually does not count as a hit but it can be difficult to tell the difference between significant splatter and a genuine direct hit. * Overshooting ‚Äì Fields may discourage players from overshooting (also regarded as bonus balling, \\"ramping\\", \\"overkill\\", or lighting up), which is to repeatedly shoot an opposing player after he is eliminated from the game. It is also considered overshooting if a player knew the opponent was eliminated but continued to shoot, disregarding the safety of the opposing player and risking dangerous injury to others. * Ramping ‚Äì Ramping is a feature of many electronic markers, where after a certain number of rapid shots or upon a threshold rate-of-fire being achieved by the player, the gun will begin firing faster than the trigger is being pulled. Ramping of rate of fire is prohibited or sharply limited at most paintball fields, however it is allowed in various tournament formats with specific rules governing when and how the marker may ramp. * Wiping ‚Äì Players may attempt to cheat by wiping paint from themselves, to pretend they were not hit and stay in the game. If caught, \\"wipers\\" are generally called out of the game, and in recreational paintball may be ejected from the field for multiple instances of wiping. Various tournament rules state additional penalties for players or teams caught wiping, such as \\"3-for-1\\" (calling the wiping player and the nearest three players out) in PSP capture-the-flag, or a prescribed number of \\"penalty minutes\\" in XBall. * Non- contact - While paintball does involve tagging players with paintball projectiles, this is generally considered the sole point of physical contact between members of opposing teams. Players are generally prohibited from physically contacting other players, such as colliding with them, physically restraining them, and especially using fists, feet, protective gear or the markers themselves to hit other players. Fisticuffs in particular are dangerous not only to the participants but to all players on or off the field, and referees are generally trained to respond immediately and aggressively to stop the fight, and to eject and ban instigators of these fights. * Velocity - Though most paintball markers are capable of firing at muzzle velocities of around 300 fps, The players paintball marker is generally limited to a muzzle velocity of 280 fps for safety reasons.https://www.liveabout.com/mph- paintball-gun-shoot-2565741 = Strategy = Player and team strategy varies depending on the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents to reduce the number of directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options they have for choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has. A key element of intermediate and advanced strategy is the concept of \\"firing lanes\\". These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is \\"occupied\\" if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it's \\"active\\" if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between themselves and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied firing lanes there are; when most available firing lanes on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent's location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs in the course of a game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most firing lanes on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening firing lanes and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent. Typically, strategy is limited for casual walk-on style paintball play. Some teamwork will be seen at the beginning of the games with brief discussions on tactics and strategy, such as distributing players between bunkers and assigning defenders that will stay back and cover attackers that advance. However, mid to late game tactics tend to be limited to groups of players sticking together or doing isolated attacks rather than a coordinated sweep down the field. In team paintball tournaments, more serious planned team tactics and strategy is seen throughout each game from the opening to the endgame. Teams generally practice together and have planned tactics they can use in the tournament, and know what each of their teammates will be trying to do in various situations during the game.  Playing venues  A \\"speedball\\" field consisting of inflatable paintball bunkers A non- commercial, community paintball field with wooden structures in Mexico, which is used in playing \\"renegade\\" or \\"gotcha\\" paintball Paintball is played at both commercial venues, which require paid admission, and private land; both of which may include multiple fields of varying size and layout. Fields can be scattered with either natural or artificial terrain, and may also be themed to simulate a particular environment, such as a wooded or urban area, and may involve a historical context. Smaller fields (such as those used for speedball and tournament play) may include an assortment of various inflatable bunkers; these fields are less prone to cause injury as the bunkers are little more than air bags, which can absorb the impact of a player colliding with them. Before these inflatable fields became available and popular, speedball fields were commonly constructed of various rigid building materials, such as plywood and framing timber, shipping pallets, even concrete and plastic drainage pipe. The use of plastic pipe tethered with stakes became common, as it allowed for relatively easy reconfiguration of fields and at least some impact-absorption, and was the precursor to the modern inflatable bunker (in fact, certain common features in inflatable fields, such as \\"can\\" and \\"snake\\" bunkers, were derived from similar features built with plastic drainage pipe). Recreational fields still commonly use these older materials for their higher durability and novelty; inflatable bunkers are prone to bursting seams or otherwise developing holes and leaks. Other fields have wooden or plastic barriers. Commercial venues may provide amenities such as bathrooms, picnic areas, lockers, equipment rentals, air refills and food service. Countries may have paintball sports guidelines, with rules on specific safety and insurance standards, and paid staff (including referees) who must ensure players are instructed in proper play to ensure participants' safety. Some fields are \\"BYOP\\" (Bring Your Own Paint), allowing players to buy paint at unrelated retail stores or online and use it at their field. However, most fields are FPO (Field Paint Only,) meaning players must buy paint at the venue or at a pro shop affiliated with the park. This is largely for revenue reasons; field and rental fees generally do not cover expenses of a paintball park. However, other reasons relating to player safety are generally cited and have some merit, as poor quality or poorly stored paint can cause gun failures or personal injury to targeted players. Other times, FPO policies are in keeping with municipal laws for wastewater and runoff; paintballs contain food dyes, and some formulations have metallic flakes and/or cornstarch to make them more visible, all of which can pose problems in water reservoirs and treatment plants. So, fields that must wash paintball paint into municipal wastewater facilities, or that have substantial rain runoff into bodies of water that are used as sources of drinking water, are generally required by the municipality to restrict players to only certain paint formulations; the easiest way to achieve this is to sell only approved paint and require that field paint be used. Playing on a non-established field is sometimes referred to as renegade or gonzo play or outlaw ball (with the players nicknamed renegade ballers or outlaws). Though less expensive and less structured than play at a commercial facility, the lack of safety protocols, instruction, and oversight can lead to higher incidence of injuries.  Organized play  Green paintballs The first organized paintball game in record was held by Charles Gaines and his friends in New Hampshire in 1981, with the first paintball field opening approximately a year later in Sutton, New Hampshire. In 1983, the first National Survival Game (NSG) championship was held, with a $14,000 cash award for the winning team. , tournaments are largely organized by paintball leagues. = Leagues = A Speedball league is an organization that provides a regulated competition for Speedball players to compete. Leagues can be of various sizes (for example, regional, national or international) and offer organized tournaments and or games for professional, semi-professional, and amateur teams, sometimes with financial prizes. The first British national league was the British Paintball League created in 1989 by Gary Morhall, Richard Hart and Derek Wildermuth in Essex England. As of 2017, the major leagues in the United States are the National X-ball League (NXL), Carolina Field Owners Association (CFOA), Maximum Velocity Paintball Series (MVPS), the Northern Xtreme Paintball League (NXPL). Internationally, the Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) in Asia, the Millennium Series in western Europe, the Centurio series in Eastern Europe, and the National Collegiate Paintball Association in the US and Canada (A league was also created for high school and college players, the NCPA.*Not recognized by the NCAA*). See list of current leagues under North American Leagues menu They are supplemented by various regional and local leagues spread worldwide. Within these leagues it is narrowed down further to divisions. There are six divisions from division 5 to division 1 besides various professional leagues. = Tournament format = The nature and timing of paintball events are specified by the league running the tournament, with the league also defining match rules ‚Äì such as number of players per team (anywhere from 3-7 players per team), or acceptable equipment for use. The number of matches in a tournament is largely defined by the number of available teams playing. However, the NSL offers non-tournament game play where a more traditional game day format has been adopted. Two teams face off at a set time and play only one game per game day in the season as beginners play a 24-minute game and amateur and professionals play a 32-minute game, both requiring 90 minutes to resolve. A match in a tournament is refereed by a judge, whose authority and decisions are final. Tournament rules can vary as specified by the league, but may include for example ‚Äì not allowing players to use devices to communicate with other persons during a game, or not allowing players to unduly alter the layout of terrain on the field. In contrast to a casual game designed for fun, a tournament is much stricter and violations of rules may result in penalties for the players or entire teams. Though tournament paintball was originally played in the woods, speedball became the standard competitive format in the 1990s. The smaller fields made use of artificial terrain such as bunkers, allowing symmetrical fields that eliminate terrain advantages for either team; woodsball fields having no such guarantee. Most recently, fields using inflatable bunkers, tethered to the ground with stakes, have become standard for most tournament formats; the soft, yielding bunkers reduce the occurrence of injuries, the bunkers deflate to store in a compact space and anchor to the ground with tent stakes, allowing for temporary fields to be set up and torn down with less impact on the ground underneath, and the arrangement of bunkers can be easily re-configured to maintain novelty of play or to simulate a predetermined field layout for an upcoming event. = Professional teams = A professional paintball team is one that plays paintball with the financial, equipment or other kind of support of one or more sponsors, often in return for advertising rights. Professional teams can have different names in different leagues due to franchising and sponsorship issues.  Accused terrorists' usage  In the past, unlawful groups and terrorists have been accused of using paintball for tactical training purposes in connection with the following incidents: Mohamed Mahmood Alessa and Carlos \\"Omar\\" Eduardo Almonte, two men arrested in June 2010 as they were bound for Somalia, and charged with terrorism and conspiring to kill, maim, and kidnap people outside the U.S., had simulated combat at an outdoor paintball facility in West Milford, New Jersey, according to the complaint against them. Similarly, 11 men, convicted in 2003‚Äì04 of composing the Virginia Jihad Network, engaged in paintball training in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, to simulate guerrilla operations and develop combat skills to prepare for jihad, according to prosecutors. In 2006, Ali Asad Chandia of the Virginia Jihad Network was sentenced to 15 years in prison aiding the Pakistani terrorist organization, Lashkar-e-Taiba, including arranging a shipment of 50,000 paintballs from the U.S. to Pakistan. In addition, two of the 2005 London 7/7 bombers were filmed while training in June 2005 at a paintball center in Tonbridge, Kent. Also, the suspects in the 2006 Toronto Terrorism case played paintball to prepare for their attack. In 2007, paintball training was engaged in by five terrorists to prepare for an attack aimed at killing American soldiers in Fort Dix, New Jersey; they were later convicted.  Safety statistics  Paintball players in mid-game The rate of injury to paintball participants has been estimated as 45 injuries per 100,000 participants per year. Research published by the Minnesota Paintball Association has argued that paintball is one of the statistically safest sports to participate in, with 20 injuries per 100,000 players annually,(2003): National Injury Information Clearinghouse of the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission in Washington D.C. (Published by Minnesota Paintball Association) Paint-ball.org . Retrieved 2007-02-19. and these injuries tend to be incidental to outdoor physical activity (e.g. trip-and- fall). A 2003 study of the 24 patients with modern sports eye injuries presenting to the eye emergency department of Porto S√£o Jo√£o Hospital between April 1992 and March 2002 included five paintball eye injuries. Furthermore, a one-year study undertaken by the Eye Emergency Department, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston has shown that most sports eye injuries are caused by basketball, baseball, hockey, and racquetball. Another analysis concluded that eye injuries incurred from paintball were in settings where protective equipment such as masks were not enforced, or were removed by the player. Eye injuries can occur when protective equipment is not properly used and such injuries often cause devastating visual loss. For safety, most regulated paintball fields strictly enforce a 'masks-on' policy, and most eject players who consistently disobey. Regardless, paintball has received criticism due to incidents of injury. In Canada in 2007, an eleven-year-old boy lifted his mask and was shot point blank in the eye by an adult playing on the same field, leading to calls by the Montreal Children's Hospital to restrict the minimum age of paintball participants to 16 years. In Australia, the sport attracted criticism when a 39-year-old man playing at a registered field in Victoria died of a suspected heart attack, after being struck in the chest. Additionally, the use of paintball markers outside a regulated environment has caused concern. In the United States in 1998, 14-year-old Jorel Lynn Travis was shot with a paintball gun while standing outside a Fort Collins, Colorado ice cream parlor ‚Äì blinding her in one eye. In 2001, a series of pre-meditated and racially motivated drive-by shootings targeted Alaska Natives in Anchorage, Alaska, using a paintball marker. In Ottawa, Canada in 2007, Ashley Roos was shot in the eye and blinded with a paintball gun while waiting for a bus. In 2014 in the UK, as a marketing strategy, one company advertised and hired a Human Bullet Tester.  Legality = Argentina = Paintball has been considered an inappropriate game, that promotes violence, by the Parliament of the Province of Buenos Aires. The approved law 14,492 (December 2012) regulates its use: it is totally forbidden for children under 16 years old, but can be played with written authorization by the parents, or responsible person in charge, of youths between 16 and 18 years old. Originally, the initiative had proposed the total prohibition for players under 21 years old. The penalties are also established by law, as 30 days of communitarian work or other modalities. = Australia = Paintballing in Australia is controlled by the police in each state, with differing minimum age requirements. Players under 18 are required to have a guardian sign a consent form. The minimum ages are 12 for South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia, 15 for Queensland, 16 for Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. Previously the minimum age for Victoria was 18, but legislation has recently been introduced to lower the legal age for paintball to 16.http://crumpets.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/bill/jlaaomb2014550/ Both major parties in Victoria have supported the changes. To own a paintball marker privately in Australia (outside Tasmania and the Northern Territory) one must hold a valid firearms license endorsed for paintball use. In the Northern Territory they are considered a Class C firearm and private ownership is illegal. In Western Australia they are considered a Category E(5) miscellaneous weapon. In New South Wales, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and Queensland they are considered Class A firearms for the purposes of licensing and storage. In Victoria they are now classified as a Category P firearm. Operators must adhere to legislation on gun storage, safety training and field sizes; private owners have to secure their markers according to state law on storage, as by law paintball markers are considered firearms in Australia. = Cyprus = As in Australia, paintballing in the Republic of Cyprus is controlled by police, i.e. all paintball markers must be registered and licensed, the field must be in certain standards that is inspected by police in order to obtain the license for a paintball field. The process of buying one's own paintball marker is just as complicated, the buyer must have completed military service, have a clean police record and be over the age of 18 years. Minimum age for paintball is 14 years old with parents consent, from 16 and up no parental consent is required. It is required that all players must wear protective mask as well and neck and chest protection. Paintball markers are not allowed to exceed 290 fps velocity and a maximum of 12 bit/s firing rate. = Germany = In Germany, paintball is restricted to players over 18 years of age. Paintball markers are classified as weapons that do not require a license or permit; they are legal to buy and use, but restricted to adults. Markers are limited to a kinetic energy of 7.5 J. Tampering with the marker to increase muzzle velocity above 214 fps can lead to confiscation/destruction of the marker and a fine. All paintball markers sold officially in Germany must be certified by the government \\"Physikalisch- Technische Bundesanstalt\\" (PTB) (Federal Physical and Technical Institute) to operate within these limits and must have a registered serial number and an official stamp on the firing mechanism. In May 2009, reacting to the Winnenden school shooting, German lawmakers announced plans to ban games such as paintball as they allegedly trivialized and encouraged violence but the plans were retracted a few days later. Most Indoor-Paintball-Areas in Germany have a strict \\"No-Mil-Sim\\"-Policy, meaning that no camouflage clothing or real-life looking markers are allowed. = Ireland = Paintballing is widely accepted as a recreational pastime in Ireland and is not directly subject to any governing regulations. In Northern Ireland all paintball guns are classified as firearms and as such all gun owners needs to obtain a license from the PSNI (Police Service of Northern Ireland). There is also a minimum age where all players need to be 16 or older. Paintball is governed by the local Garda√≠ in the Republic of Ireland. A firearms licence is required for both personal and site use. Weapon storage guidelines and security must also be strictly adhered to. = New Zealand = Paintball markers are classified as Airguns under New Zealand law, and as such are legal for persons 18 and over to possess (those between the ages of 16 and 18 require a firearms license). Following the Arms (Military Style Semi-automatic Firearms and Import Controls) Amendment Act 2012 (Which came into effect on December 1, 2013), fully automatic Paintball guns are legal to purchase and use, although a permit to procure from the New Zealand Police is required in order to legally import them into the country. Military replicas require a permit for import. = United Kingdom = Paintballing venues in the United Kingdom are accredited by bodies such as the United Kingdom Paintball Association and the UKPSF (UK Paintball Sports Federation). These bodies define codes of practice for venue operators, but accredition with these bodies is voluntary. Laws pertaining to paintball markers in the United Kingdom classify them as a type of air gun, although some could be considered to be imitation firearms.rown Prosecution Service: Firearms Owners do not require a license unless the marker fires above . Only approved paintballs may be used, and the marker must not be fully automatic. The minimum age to be in possession of a marker is seventeen, except in target shooting clubs or galleries, or on private property so long as projectiles are not fired beyond the premises. It is prohibited to be in possession of a paintball marker in public places. The minimum age for a commercial venue is generally 10, although some venues provide lower-powered guns for children of a younger age. = United States = In the United States, eight states define explicit legislation for paintball guns. In Pennsylvania, paintball markers have transport requirements, cannot be used against anyone not participating in a paintball activity, and cannot be used for property damage.New Hampshire and Rhode Island require players be at least eighteen years of age to own a marker, with students in New Hampshire faced with the possibility of expulsion from school for possessing a marker. In Illinois, owners must be at least 13 years of age, and Illinois law makes it unlawful to fire a paintball gun from or across a street, sidewalk, road, highway, public land, or public place except on a safely constructed target range.https://www.cga.ct.gov/2008/rpt/2008-R-0571.htm Virginia is one of two states that permit its towns to adopt ordinances on paintball guns, allowing its local authorities to do so. Delaware on the other hand only authorizes Wilmington to do so, but does allow paintball to be played on farms as it is considered an agritourism activity. Florida and Texas limit government liability if a government entity allows paintball on its property. In virtually all jurisdictions, the use of a paintball marker in a manner other than its intended purpose and/or outside the confines of a sanctioned game or field can result in criminal charges such as disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, vandalism, criminal mischief or even aggravated assault. Paintball guns may also be considered air guns in some states. The possession and use of paintball guns in public places may also provoke officer-involved shootings from police.https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2018/04/27/detroit- police-paintball-gun-use/559337002/  Paintball around the world = Australia = Despite stiff legislation, paintball is growing in popularity as a competitive sport, with several leagues and tournaments across the country. There are paintball fields in every state except Tasmania that allows paintball marker ownership. In Victoria the Paintball Association of Victoria runs a number of events including scenario, 3v3 and 5v5 competitions. = Canada = Certain paintball fields opened in the Eastern Townships and in the Laurentians. In the beginning it was mostly fields with regular open fields with barricades of wood, old tires and barrels, and very basic infrastructure. Harry Kruger has operated a paintball venue known as \\"Capture the Flag\\" in Alberta since the late 1980s. In 1995 Bigfoot Paintball opened in St. Alphonse-Rodriguez in the region of Lanaudi√®re. After only a few years it became more and more prominent in Qu√©bec. In 2013, paintball has become relatively mainstream in Canada, with multiple commercial indoor paintball facilities located in most large cities across Canada, as well as a variety of outdoor style commercial paintball fields located in the countryside around the cities. In 2016, the Ontario Paintball League (OPL) was created. The league offers four divisions with cash and gear prizes for the different divisions. In 2018, the most recent NXL World Cup winners, Edmonton Impact, or just Impact, were based out of Canada. = Cyprus = There are about ten fields in Cyprus, the most recognized of them being the Lapatsa Paintball Ranch in Nicosia, DNA-Paintball in Paphos, and Paintball Cyprus in Limassol. The Republic of Cyprus has a number of ongoing paintball leagues, including CRL (Cyprus Rec-ball League) and CSL (Cyprus Speedball League). Each league has tournaments every month for the duration of the season which is usually about 7‚Äì9 months. = Denmark = In Denmark paintball is a popular sport. There are around 25 paintball outdoor and indoor fields in Denmark. The largest indoor paintball center in Europe is in Copenhagen. = India = In India as of 2018, paintball fields are found in many cities. The youth have taken a liking to this adventure sport. In India, paintball dates back to 2005 when TPCI (The Paintball Co India) joined with PALS (Paintball Asia League Series) which then was the biggest paintball tournament organizer in the Asian circuit and introduced this sport to the country by starting the first commercial paintball park on the outskirts of the national capital at Damdama Lake in Gurgaon, Haryana. With the growth of outsourcing and offshoring of IT companies, especially in New Delhi and Bangalore, paintball as a sport is being used as a tool for corporate training. There has been a sharp increase in woodsball, speedball and scenario gaming arenas and is growing at a fast pace. Many semi-urban Indian cities have built indoor and outdoor paintball fields in recent years. National Paintball League - India (Now Disfunc) was the first paintball operator to organise an international paintball championship in India in 2011. PaintBall X Bangalore, has the only International Standard \\"Speedball\\" arena in India. Started in 2010 they are actively involved with promoting paintball as a sport in India. They sponsor teams to play international paintball events with the latest being the NXL - Asia (National X Ball League - Asia) held at Penang - Malaysia in July 2019. Team X is the only Indian team that has made it to the podium in International participations in the last decade. Last concluded India Level paintball tournament was the PaintBall X - India Cup 2018. War Lords - The Paintball Field in Rajasthan is India's most versatile scenario based Paintball field with over 3 different terrains for Paintball which includes two \\"Woodsball\\" Paintball. Woodsball paintball is only available in Paintball Jodhpur. their unique \\"Point based paintball game\\" is unique to every other paintball field in India. Bootcamp Adventure Zone in Gujarat has four outlets, three in Ahmedabad and one in Statue of Unity, Vadodara. Delta 9 Adventures hosts three paintball fields at their Vadodara arena. They host multiple tournaments throughout the year for various paintball divisions. India has been participating in world championships since 2009. The following are few of India's top paintball teams: Paint Mechanix (Chennai) Team X (Bangalore) Hooliguns (Bangalore) Skwad 7 (Bangalore) Goan Dominance (Goa) = Iran = In Iran, paintball is a popular recreation but also considered an expensive and/or dangerous sport. Nearly every city has one or more paintball fields but only a few of them offer woodsball and realistic terrain, and every province has one or more teams that play in the national paintball league. Iran itself has a national team. = Lebanon = Hezbollah, the militant group and political party based in Lebanon, has trained with paintball. = Malaysia = Paintball is a very popular sport in Malaysia. The Malaysian paintball community is considered the largest in Asia. The Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) is headquartered in Petaling Jaya near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. They organize tournaments and events around the Asian region. There are also the Malaysian Paintball Official Circuit (MPOC), Malaysian National Paintball League (MY-NPL), the Malaysian Super Sevens Series, World Paintball Players League (WPPL), the Malaysian Ultimate Woodsball League (UWL Malaysia), and Tactical Paintball Championship (TPC). The Paintball World Cup Asia is also held annually in Langkawi island. Several woodsball and scenario big games are also held throughout the year such as the International Scenario Paintball Games (ISPG) and by Paintball Warfare Group Malaysia (PWG-Malaysia). There are many commercial paintball fields operating in almost every major city across the country, with most of them concentrated around the Klang Valley region. However, in December 2013, the Royal Malaysian Police stated that all paintball markers must be owned with a licence and owners must hand in their markers. Some paintball organizations have stated that this will be \\"a big blow\\" to paintball in the country while others stated that this will not affect the sport at all. In February 2019 The high court has said that paintball markers do not fall under the firearms act but look alike weapons do fall under the category of imitation firearms. This means that paintball markers that do not look like firearms can be owned by anyone with a licence. = South Africa = In South Africa, organised paintball has been played since the late 1980s. The only legal enforcement regarding paintball is the concealment of paintball (and airsoft) guns in public areas. There are no license requirements or age limitations in place, but with the threat of the implementation of the \\"Dangerous Weapons Act\\", this could change. South Africa has seen a steady growth of the sport of paintball since its introduction. Recreational bushball is the most popular form throughout the country, but the last couple of years have seen a big increase in the popularity of speedball. The South African Paintball League has been in existence since 2002. During 2013 South Africa was invited to send a representative paintball team to the first ever Paintball World Cup held in Paris, France. The South African team got officially ranked 13th in the world. Popular tournaments such as The Tippmann Challenge, D-Day and the Navy Festival SWAT Challenge, see hundreds of players from around the entire country participate. The first ever public paintball performance in South Africa was held at the Swartkop Airshow during 2013. More than 80 paintball players took part a in a simulated a counter terrorist raid on a weapons dealer. Currently, the biggest national speedball league in South Africa is the SARPL (South African Regional Paintball League) with over 500 members and hosting both a 3-man and 5-man series events in 5 provinces (including Gauteng, Kwazulu Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and the Free State). The league hosts around 31 events per year on a regional and national level with the national finals that takes place at Oviston, Lake Gariep beginning December of each year starting at the end of 2013. The SARPL currently play PSP Race-to-2 format and use the PSP rule set as well as using APPA system for player classification. = Thailand = Paintball is a very niche yet extremely competitive sport in Thailand. Thai paintball teams are considered to be one of the strongest, if not the strongest in Asia. Thai teams have taken home the Division 1 Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) World Cup and series titles in year 2012, 2014, and 2015. In 2014, Thai teams made history by taking victories in all Divisions 1, 2, and 3 at the PALS World Cup at Langkawi Island, Malaysia. This trend continued into 2015, with Thai teams taking victories in Divisions 1 and 2 during the PALS World Cup 2015. Along with winning the PALS World Cup titles in 2014 and 2015, all respective teams also took the overall series titles for their respective divisions in 2014 and 2015. Thai paintball continues to grow at a slow pace, thus allowing the community to be a very well knit family. = Turkey = At first, paintball was engaged to the Turkey Shooting and Hunting Federation in 2006, it has grown especially in recent years in Turkey. It has organized at least four tournaments each year in different cities. Particularly on the European side of Istanbul, there are some paintball areas opened in the last decade. = United Arab Emirates = Paintball is a growing sport in the United Arab Emirates. Paintball was first introduced in the UAE and the Middle East in 1996. The very first paintball facility was established in Dubai with the technical assistance of some of the best European and American Paintball operators in the industry. = Bangladesh = In Bangladesh paintball is rear game. It just came somewhere in this country and some people got interested in this game. This game was first initiated in the BD and the Middle East in 1996. Somewhere in Dhaka established paintball game by following the rules of this game. = Singapore = Paintball in Singapore started in the late 1990s as a recreational team building activity for corporate sectors. Singapore was one of the earliest countries in South East Asia to introduce paintball as a team building tool. TAG Paintball which was originally located in Downtown East shifted its operations to Orchid Country Club (Yishun) and remained there for almost a decade. Speedball which is the competitive side of paintball was introduced in 2007 by Red Dynasty Paintball Park through a competition known as the Singapore Paintball Novice Series (SPNS). The first tournament saw the participation of 8 3on3 teams which PSG Warfreakz taking the Champion title. The SPNS was later renamed as the Singapore Paintball Series in 2010 to cater to the growing sport. Over the years, Singapore held many international paintball tournaments notably the Paintball Asia League Series (PALS) Singapore edition in 2015 and 2016, the GI.Sportz Cup in 2017 and the Asia Girls Paintball International Championship (AGPIC) in 2018. The AGPIC is the only All-Female paintball tournament to promote women's paintball in Asia. All tournaments were held in Red Dynasty Paintball Park which houses 2 internationally sized speedball fields with artificial turf grass.

In semi-direct democracy, representatives administer daily governance, but citizens keep the sovereignty, being able to control their governments and laws through different forms of popular action: binding referendum, popular initiative, revocation of mandate, and public consultations. The first two forms‚Äîreferendums and initiatives‚Äîare examples of direct legislation.  History  Modern-era citizen lawmaking began in the towns of Switzerland in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the \\"statute referendum\\" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the \\"constitutional amendment initiative\\". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative. In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.  Application  A government is elected, but unlike the representative system, there are binding mechanisms of control, where the people take power and can veto laws of parliament, or propose new laws, which will subsequently be subject to a binding referendum. These mechanisms are the binding referendum and the popular legislative initiative. There are other mechanisms such as the revocation of the mandate, the avocation and the plebiscite. The main countries of application are Switzerland and Liechtenstein. = Switzerland = Switzerland, with no need to register, every citizen receives the ballot papers and information brochure for each vote, and can return it by post. Switzerland has various directly democratic instruments; votes (and elections) are organised about four times a year; here, to Berne's citizen in November 2008 about 5 national, 2 cantonal, 4 municipal referendums, and 2 elections (government and parliament of the City of Berne) to take care of at the same time. The pure form of direct democracy exists only in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus. The Swiss Confederation is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy). The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in German also called the Subsidiarit√§tsprinzip). Landsgemeinde in Sarnen Most western countries have representative systems.Vincent Golay and Mix et Remix, Swiss political institutions, √âditions loisirs et p√©dagogie, 2008. . Switzerland is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, cantons, and federal state). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution (popular initiative), or ask for an optional referendum to be held on any law voted by the federal, cantonal parliament and/or municipal legislative body. The list for mandatory or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well. Swiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level, such as financial approvals of a school house or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland, four times a year. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions. During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums. In Switzerland, simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and cantonal level, but at the federal level double majorities are required on constitutional issues. A double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. popular initiative) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005). In 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the United States Congress, in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the states. According to its supporters, this \\"legitimacy-rich\\" approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, \\"Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer.\\" Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a multi-level governance context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of European Union integration.Trechsel (2005) = United States = Some of the states of United States have a form of semi-direct democracy where citizens can start the referendum process if they are able to gather enough petition signatures. If enough petition signatures are gathered then the entire state's electorate can vote to approve or disapprove of the ballot measure.

Richardson) (guitar), Rick Skatore (born Kenneth D. Lucas) (bass), Kindu Phibes (drums), and P. Fluid (born Peter Forrest) (vocals). The band is best known for mixing R&B;, soul, funk and reggae with heavy metal and hardcore punk. The fact that they are African Americans playing variations of heavy metal led critics to compare them to bands such as Living Colour and Bad Brains. Though they were pioneers in the fusion of these particular music styles, influencing many bands, they have never achieved substantial commercial success. After several lineup changes, the band broke up in 1998, but reformed in 2003 before releasing their first new album of original material in over a decade in 2006. As of January 2020, the lineup of the band includes Hazel, Skatore, and drummer Tony Lewis. Band history=Early days and In-Effect Records= Upon their formation in 1986, the band, consisting of Jimi Hazel, Rick Skatore, Kindu Phibes, and P. Fluid, quickly earned a dedicated following in New York City due to the eclectic mix of their music. The band would switch gears from Motown and soul sounds with lush vocal harmonies to violent heavy metal and hardcore punk with ease, sometimes several times within the course of one song. Phibes left the band in 1987. In 1988, In-Effect Records, a subsidiary of Relativity, signed the band which now included Anthony Johnson, formerly of the three-piece New York ska band, A-Kings, replacing Phibes on drums. The band released their debut album, the genre-hopping Harder Than You, produced by Bob Musso and Jimi Hazel, in December 1988. The first single was a cover of the Kool & the Gang song \\"Jungle Boogie.\\" Critics and fans took notice of the band's left-wing political stance and the unique sound of their tight-knit, high-energy music. The album sold just under 300,000 units due to non-stop touring worldwide and became an underground hit. It remains a pioneering classic in the rock/funk/hip hop genre made popular in later years by such bands as 311, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock. The video for \\"Jungle Boogie\\" was the first single video on MTV to air on all of the following specialty shows: 120 Minutes, Yo! MTV Raps, Hard 60, and Headbanger's Ball. The band's second album, 1990's Gumbo Millennium, produced by Jimi Hazel and Tom Soares, was once again released through In-Effect Records. The album was much softer than the previous effort, focusing mostly on clean guitar and lush R&B; harmonies and grooves although it still contained elements of thrash metal and punk. The first single, \\"Don't Break My Heart!,\\" while commercially viable, failed to receive radio airplay. Regardless, the album sold over 300,000 units once again due to massive amounts of touring and proved to be an underground success. It soon brought the attention of several major labels. The band were soon opening for Jane's Addiction on their 'Ritual De Lo Habitual' tour. The tour brought the band to a new audience but their growing success could not halt the sudden departure of Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid. Fluid made the announcement of his departure during the band's live performance on the final date of the Jane's Addiction tour. Allegedly, he had not made it known to his bandmates beforehand. Johnson followed suit and, as a result of the departures, the band dropped out of a planned co-headlining tour with Suicidal Tendencies. Fluid soon made it known that he intended to start a new band named The P. Fluid Foundation. { class=\\"toccolours\\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\\"float: right; width: 375px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\\" + 24-7 Spyz personnel - ! bgcolor=\\"#E7EBEE\\"  (1986‚Äì1987)  * P.

Jeff Brodnax was brought in as the new vocalist along with former Cro-Mags and Bad Brains drummer, Mackie Jayson. Jayson only rehearsed with the band for a short time before leaving, to be replaced by Joel Maitoza. The new lineup received rave reviews and the band was soon signed to East West Records America, a division of Atlantic Records headed by label president, Sylvia Rhone. The company tested the marketability of the new band by releasing a five-song EP titled This is...24-7 Spyz!, produced by Jimi Hazel and Bruce Calder in 1991. In 1992, the band received their largest commercial exposure to date by appearing in a Budweiser television commercial that aired for the first five months of the year. Soon after, the hour-long Strength In Numbers album, produced by Terry Date and Jimi Hazel, was released and proved to be the band's most critically acclaimed release to date. The album saw the band depart from its New York hardcore roots to concentrate more on heavy metal and soul. Unfortunately, by that time, popular music had begun shifting away from musical dexterity and in favor of the simplicity of grunge. The album's single, \\"Break The Chains,\\" received minor radio airplay and MTV exposure but Sylvia Rhone pulled the label's support before dropping the band altogether. To the band's dismay, the label only pressed 18,000 pieces and allotted 2,000 for press purposes, thus making the disc widely unavailable almost immediately. Disgusted by their dealings with East West and Sylvia Rhone, the band members began working on other musical projects. Hazel and Skatore looked to form a new band, Black Angus, with Follow for Now drummer Bernard \\"Enrique\\" Coley. The Black Angus sessions were eventually recorded with drummer and longtime friend Carlton Smith of the Royal Crescent Mob. Maitoza formed Shockhead with vocalist Joseph McCraw and Nixons bassist Ricky Wolking, recording one disc, titled Television, which was produced by Jimi Hazel. Brodnax concentrated on his band, Egypt. =The Enemy Label= When Hazel and Skatore discovered how popular the first two albums remained in Europe, they reunited with Anthony Johnson and P. Fluid, now performing as Forrest (his real last name) to release Temporarily Disconnected, produced by Jimi Hazel. The album was released exclusively in Europe by Enemy Records, and was followed by a quick tour of the continent before Johnson and Fluid left the band once again. In March 1996, 6, produced by Jimi Hazel, was released exclusively in Europe through the Enemy label. The album contained covers of The Association's \\"Along Comes Mary\\" and Love's \\"7 and 7 Is.\\" The album was titled 6 due to it being the sixth release by the band. In September 1996, What Are Records released Heavy Metal Soul by the Pound, the American version of 6. The track listing would remain almost identical to 6 with the exception of the removal of \\"Along Comes Mary\\" and \\"7 and 7 Is\\" and the additions of \\"Earth And Sky\\" and \\"Save The World\\" as replacements. Both versions of the album saw the band returning as a trio with Jimi Hazel on guitar and lead vocals, Rick Skatore on bass and Joel Maitoza returning to the drums for the first time in four years. Two tracks recorded before Maitoza's return featured guest drummer Carlton Smith of Royal Crescent Mob. Additional vocals were contributed by Doug Pinnick of King's X for the songs \\"Love And Peace\\" and \\"Yeah X 3\\". The next release was the If I Could EP, available exclusively through their fan club and featuring remixes and live performances of several songs. In 1998, a disagreement between Hazel and Skatore led to the dissolution of 24-7 Spyz. =Solo albums and reformations= In 2000, Hazel co-wrote several songs for a band named Crime, who were using the material to shop for labels. Skatore re- emerged in 2001, playing bass in a band named Blockk-16 alongside Savatage guitarist Chris Caffery. The band's first release, Too Brutal For Radio also featured appearances by Andrew Freeman, Ray Freeman Jr, Mosh Ben-Ari, Ronen Barak and Spread Eagle vocalist, Ray West. After the release of the album, Skatore suffered from a collapsed lung. Despite their prior disagreement, Hazel came to the aid of his friend by performing together as 24-7 Spyz for a benefit concert at New York City's CBGB's. Proceeds from the show went towards Skatore's medical bills. Jimi Hazel with 24-7 Spyz in 2012 In 2002, Hazel released his first solo CD, 21stCenturySouthBronxRockStar on his own label, The Gumbo Recording Company. It was followed by the formation of Maitoza's new band, Crown 10, in May 2003. 2003 also saw Hazel and Skatore reunite for a second CBGB's performance with Tony Lewis on drums. Later that year, Hazel and Skatore would announce the official re-formation of 24-7 Spyz. In 2005, the band released a limited edition DVD titled HMS4L: The Many Lives of Walter Rattamus through their website. The DVD tells the history of the band through the various incarnations and also includes commentary from Jimi Hazel and Rick Skatore. Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal with Jimi Hazel at a show in Brooklyn In 2006, the band released Face the Day, with new drummer Tobias Ralph, through The Gumbo Recording Company label. The disc was produced by Jimi Hazel and Ron \\"Bumblefoot\\" Thal and was the first 24-7-Spyz studio album in a decade. Shortly thereafter, the band released a live performance from 1998 as a digital download and CD titled Can You Hear the Sound?. In 2009, Hazel and Skatore began focusing their attention on a new side project called A.N.M. (Anti Nigger Machine). Other members of the band included Doug Pinnick (vocals), Greg Fulton (guitar and vocals), Spacey T (guitar and vocals) plus Philip \\"Fish\\" Fisher (drums and percussion). Later that year, they released a four-song demo via their MySpace page. In 2010, the band began soliciting donations to fund the recording of their first album. On August 6, 2011, 24-7 Spyz performed at the Highline Ballroom in New York City. The show saw former members Jeff Brodnax and Joel Maitoza return for a reunion of the Strength in Numbers era lineup. In November 2011, the band announced that the lineup would continue performing together with the Strength In Numbers Twentieth Anniversary Tour beginning with a string of European dates from late February through March, 2012. In September 2012, it was announced that the band had officially parted ways with Brodnax and Maitoza once again. It was also stated that Maitoza, Ralph and Lewis would all take part in recording drum tracks for a planned upcoming album. In November 2012, the band announced that Sekou Lumumba of Bedouin Soundclash had officially joined the band on drums. Guitarist Ronny Drayton would join the band soon after. On April 27, 2014, an image posted by the band on their official Facebook page stated that the band was on hiatus. In October 2014, the band announced via their official Facebook page that Phillip \\"Fish\\" Fisher, a founding member of Fishbone, had taken the position as drummer for the band. In January 2015, it was officially announced that the band had emerged from their self-imposed hiatus with plans to not only perform select dates in Europe but also to release a single and a new EP later in the year. The digital single, \\"Jungle (for Jef)\\" was credited as 24-7 Spyz & Family and featured a core lineup of Hazel and Drayton alongside drummer Lenny White and bassist Chico Huff, with additional instrumentation performed by Jesse Johnson, Eddie Martinez, Vernon Reid and Skatore. The song was a tribute to Jef Lee Johnson, a friend and fellow musician who had died in 2013 at age 54 due to complications from pneumonia and diabetes, and was released via iTunes and Soundcloud. The band's next release came in April 2016 in the form of CD and digital single for a song titled \\"Anthem\\" that would also be featured on their upcoming album. It was announced in 2017 that The Soundtrack To The Innermost Galaxy was expected to be released in 2018. In April 2018, the band started accepting pledges through PledgeMusic.com to fund the release of the album although a release date has yet to be announced. At Fishbone's August 24, 2018 Brooklyn, New York show, a three-piece version of the band consisting of Hazel, Skatore and Fish performed a short, unannounced opening set. On January 28, 2019, The Soundtrack to the Innermost Galaxy, their eighth studio album, was released. In January 2020, a three-piece version of the band, once again including Hazel, Skatore and the returning Tony Lewis, announced their \\"Sex, Juice & Heavy Metal Soul\\" tour which was scheduled to from April through October 2020. However, the tour was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On February 7, 2020, Ronnie Drayton died of Non Hodgkins Lymphoma at the age of 67. =Activity of former members= Anthony Johnson reappeared as the drummer for the band Middle Man before moving on to perform a lead role in the Off-Broadway production of Stomp. He was also featured in the HBO film Stomp Out Loud. While performing in Stomp, Johnson was recruited to play drums for Japanese pop star, Bonnie Pink. Johnson relocated to Japan where he lived and toured with the band for a time. He was named as the drummer for Ben Folds during a tour supporting Folds' solo album, Rockin' the Suburbs. In 2005, he made an appearance on the self-titled, five-song release by Lost Tricks, a band fronted by actor Trevor Oswalt. He has also performed with artists such as Eagle-Eye Cherry, Dionne Farris and Vanessa Daou. Johnson lives in New York City where he continues to participate in music, as a member of The Morning After Girls, and theatre. P. Fluid and the P. Fluid Foundation performed in clubs in and around New York City but never released an album. Shortly after leaving 24-7 Spyz for the second time, P. Fluid, now using the name Forrest Thinner, formed BlkVampires. The band released a five-song EP titled The Collector's Item through the Catch A Fire website. These five songs had previously been recorded by 24-7 Spyz and released on Temporarily Disconnected. In 2005, the New York City based band released their debut, self-titled album, compiling seven previously unreleased tracks as well as the five songs previously included on The Collector's Item EP. In 2010, the band released a follow-up ten-song EP/DVD titled Blkcula. A five-song release, titled The Devil's Music, followed in 2012. Also in 2012, Thinner was the creative director and publisher of a book titled The HarlequinX. The book, based on a short film and characters created by Thinner, was written by CJ Cassidy and edited by Hector Valle. Thinner also appeared in the film Riot on the Dance Floor, a documentary about City Gardens, a nightclub formerly located in Trenton, New Jersey. In 2015, the band released the two-song Eric Garner EP. In 2019, Thinner announced that BlkVampires had broken up and that he was embarking on his first solo project, BlkVampiresX. Joel Maitoza has continued playing drums with bands such as Crown 10, Shockhead, Headtrip Superstar, Don Lithgow, Sahara, Seventrain and Kerry Conally. He remains heavily involved in session work, songwriting and producing and has appeared on a total of 22 albums as of 2016. From 2000 to 2006, Maitoza managed the thrash-groove metal act Brick Bath on the Pavement/Crash Music label. In 2007, Maitoza began working with French guitarist, Christophe Godin. Maitoza reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 for a reunion of the Strength in Numbers lineup and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band's European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Maitoza and the band had parted ways again, but that Maitoza would contribute drum tracks to the band's planned 2013 album along with other previous Spyz drummers. In 2013, Maitoza joined the hard rock band, Seventrain, which also features former members of Cage and Tourniquet. Their self-titled debut album, produced by Maitoza, was released in 2014, along with a video for the single \\"Bittersweet Seduction.\\" The band was nominated for Best Hard Rock Album of the Year at the 2014 San Diego Music Awards and charted on the CMJ Top 40 Loud Rock chart in February 2014. Seventrain released their second album, titled Back on Track, also produced by Maitoza, in 2019. Maitoza parted with Seventrain in early 2019 citing irreconcilable differences. In early 2020, Maitoza announced his solo project called The Frequency Conspiracy and released two singles and accompanying videos of cover versions of \\"Rock Candy\\" by Montrose and \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" by Kansas. In September 2020, Maitoza was putting finishing touches on an album of cover tunes titled Quarantine Covers. The album features vocalist Andrew Freeman (Last in Line, Lynch Mob), bassist Jaimie Scott (Tyketto), bassist Rick Skatore (24-7 Spyz), guitarist Joshua Jones (Poster Child), guitarist Christophe Godin (M√∂rglbl, The Prize), guitarist Craig Soderberg (Shockhead, -ITIS) and guitarist Jason (JMR) Richardson (Year of the Dragon, David Pastorius), and is slated to be released in early 2021. A self-titled, full- length album of original material will be released as well. Jeff Brodnax went on to join the band Egypt. During his time with the band, they released two albums, Drowning in the Promised Land and Soul Hammer. The singer later released a solo album titled Acoustic EP in 2002. It was followed in 2009 by an album titled Forcing Me To Bend which he continues to support through touring. Like Maitoza, Brodnax reunited with 24-7 Spyz in 2011 and continued to tour with the band through 2012 for the band's European tour dates. In September 2012, it was announced that Brodnax had parted with the band for a second time. In 2019, Jeff announced his new band The Soulvation Society.

It is characterized by a decision- making structure which involves and takes into account as broad a range of opinions as possible, as opposed to systems where minority opinions can potentially be ignored by vote-winning majorities.Glossary definition from Direct Democracy in Switzerland The latter systems are classified as majoritarian democracy. Consensus democracy also features increased citizen participation both in determining the political agenda and in the decision- making process itself. Some have pointed to developments in information and communication technology as potential facilitators of such systems, for example the usage of DemocracyOS being used in Buenos Aires. Examples Consensus democracy is most closely embodied in certain countries such as Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Lebanon, Sweden, Iraq, and Belgium, where consensus is an important feature of political culture, particularly with a view to preventing the domination of one linguistic or cultural group in the political process.Lijphart, A., Patterns of Democracy: Government Forms & Performance in Thirty-six Countries. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999. The term consociational state is used in political science to describe countries with such consensus based political systems. An example of such a system could be the Dutch Poldermodel. Many parties in Lebanon call for applying consensus democracy, especially at times of crisis. =Canada= In Canada, the territorial governments of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut operate on a consensus model, unlike the oppositional political party structure that prevails elsewhere in Canada. =Guernsey= Consensus (non- party) government operates in Guernsey in the Channel Islands. Guernsey also operates a non-ministerial system of government in which government departments are headed not by ministers with executive authority, but by committees of five members. Members of the committees are elected by the 40-member States of Deliberation, which is both the parliament and the executive. The States of Guernsey (the island's parliament) last endorsed the system of consensus government by committees in 2002, when it rejected, by a very significant majority, a proposition to replace the system with executive/cabinet-style government. In 2004 Guernsey last made changes to its system of government. All major items of policy are proposed to the Assembly, by which they are approved, amended or rejected. Most items are determined by simple majority voting. At the most recent general election of people's deputies (members), all candidates campaigned as independents without affiliation with any party. Political parties have existed from time to time, but with little success. In 2009, a majority of members of Guernsey's parliament signed a letter describing their continuing commitment to consensus government by committees and opposition to executive/cabinet-style government. At their meeting on 16 July 2009, the States of Deliberation resolved to establish a Tribunal by the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence)(Guernsey) Law, 1949, as amended to inquire into the facts and circumstances of the industrial action by the Airport Fire Fighters at Guernsey Airport during May 2009, including the circumstances in which the dispute was resolved. The Resolution followed presentation of a Requ√™te dated 29 June 2009 petitioning for a Tribunal of Inquiry to be established, signed by Deputy M M Lowe and seventeen other members of the States soon after the events being investigated. The Tribunal of Inquiry's ReportGov.gg was published on 23 April 2010 and included the following text: The failure to deal with the underlying problem, which led to the industrial action 'by the firefighters, stems from the system of government which does not encourage either a corporate approach or collective responsibility. In our view there was a systemic failure to act in a corporate and strategic manner.Gov.gg During debate on the findings of the Tribunal, it was confirmed that the Tribunal's statements in respect of corporate and strategic planning related only to the topic of industrial relations and were not a more general commentary about the island's system of government. In 2010 the island's parliament indicated its continuing endorsement of government by committees and consensus when it approved by a large majority a motion which proposed that governance arrangements should be improved strictly within the existing system of government. Immediately after the 2012 general election, the States of Deliberation elected a States Review Committee to review the extent to which the legislature and the executive are capable of fulfilling expectations of good governance with particular reference to policy development, accountability, and policy co-ordination and to make recommendations for any reforms considered necessary. The States Review Committee is due to report to the States of Deliberation in two stages before the end of 2014.....

Dice The pips on these dice can be quickly counted as totalling 9 On dice, pips are small dots on each face of a common six-sided die. These pips are typically arranged in patterns denoting the numbers one through six. The sum of opposing faces traditionally adds up to seven. Pips are commonly colored black on white or yellow dice, and white on dice of other colors, although colored pips on white/yellow dice are not uncommon; Asian dice often have an enlarged red single pip for the \\"one\\" face, while the dice for the game Kismet feature black pips for 1 and 6, red pips for 2 and 5, and green pips for 3 and 4. Dominoes A domino with four pips on one side, and none on the other Dominoes use pips that are similar to dice. Each half of a domino tile can have anywhere from no pips all the way up to six or nine pips (depending on countries) arranged in the same manner to dice pips. Regardless of dominoes having up to six or up to nine pips on one half of the tile, the game is generally played for up to four players only, individually or in partners (pairs). Playing cards The Nine of Clubs with nine pips and two corner index pips. In playing cards, pips are small symbols on the front side of the cards that determine the suit of the card and its rank. For example, a standard 52-card deck consists of four suits of thirteen cards each: spades, hearts, clubs, and diamonds. Each suit contains three face cards ‚Äì the jack, queen, and king. The remaining ten cards are called pip cards and are numbered from one to ten. (The \\"one\\" is almost always changed to \\"ace\\" and often is the highest card in many games, followed by the face cards.) Each pip card consists of an encoding in the top left-hand corner (and, because the card is also inverted upon itself, the lower right-hand corner) which tells the card- holder the value of the card. In Europe, it is more common to have corner indices on all four corners which lets left-handed players fan their cards more comfortably. The center of the card contains pips representing the suit. The number of pips corresponds with the number of the card, and the arrangement of the pips is generally the same from deck to deck. Pip cards are also known as numerals or numeral cards. Many of these 52-card poker decks contain a variation on the pip style for the Ace of Spades, often consisting of an especially large pip or even a representative image, along with information about the deck's manufacturer.

Various schools of thought within Islamic jurisprudence may define this consensus to be that of the first generation of Muslims only; or the consensus of the first three generations of Muslims; or the consensus of the jurists and scholars of the Muslim world, or scholarly consensus; or the consensus of all the Muslim world, both scholars and laymen. Sunni Muslims regard ijmƒÅ' as the third fundamental source of Sharia law, after the Qur'an, and the Sunnah. The opposite of ijma (i.e., lack of consensus on a point of Islamic law) is called ikhtilaf. Usage=Sunni view= The hadith of Muhammad which states that \\"My ummah will never agree upon an error\\"Narrated by al-Tirmidhi (4:2167), ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings. and similar hadiths are often cited as a proof for the validity of ijmƒÅ'. Justification for this doctrine presented a challenge, since these hadiths were transmitted through only a limited number of isnads (transmission chains) and did not qualify as providing certain knowledge under the classical science of hadith criticism. Sunni scholars argued that the nature of human society was such that a community could not mistakenly agree that a statement had been made, and further that the consensus of the ummah about its inability to agree upon an error in itself certified the authenticity of this hadith. Sunni Muslims regard ijmƒÅ' as the third fundamental source of Sharia law, just after the divine revelation of the Qur'an, and the prophetic practice known as Sunnah. There are differing views over who is considered a part of this consensus, whether \\"the consensus is needed only among the scholars of a particular school, or legists, or legists of an early era, or the Companions, or scholars in general, or the entire Muslim community.\\"See F. Ziadeh, Lawyers and the rule of law, and liberalism in modern Egypt 146-47 (1968) supra note 4, at 118 see generally: K. Faruki, ISLAMIC JURISPRUDENCE 68 (1962)D. Mullah & M.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005. Thus, if even one individual out of millions would hold a differing view, then consensus would not have been reached. In an attempt to define consensus in a form which was more likely to ever occur, Al-Ghazali expanding on al-Shafi'i's definition to define consensus as including all of the Muslim community in regard to religious principles and restricting the meaning to only the religiously learned in regard to finer details.Majid Khadduri, Introduction to Al-Shafi'i's al- Risala, pg.38-39 Abu Hanifa, Ahmad bin Hanbal and Dawud al-Zahiri, on the other hand, considered this consensus to only include the companions of Muhammad, excluding all generations which followed them, in Medina and elsewhere.Muhammad Muslehuddin, \\"Philosophy of Islamic Law and Orientalists,\\" Kazi Publications, 1985, p. 81Dr. Mohammad Omar Farooq, \\"The Doctrine of Ijma: Is there a consensus?,\\" June 2006 Views within Sunni Islam branched off even further in later generations, with Abu Bakr Al Jassas, a hanafi scholar, defining even a simple majority view as constituting consensus and Ibn Taymiyyah restricting consensus to the view of the religiously learned only. Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari's position was not entirely clear, as modern scholarship has attributed to him both the view that consensus means a simple majority, and that it means only the consensus of the companions of Muhammad.Devin J. Stewart, \\"Muhammad b. Jarir al-Tabari's al-Bayan 'an Usul al-Ahkam and the Genre of Usul al-Fiqh in Ninth Century Baghdad,\\" pg. 339. Taken from Abbasid Studies: Occasional Papers of the School of Abbasid Studies, Cambridge, 6‚Äì10 January 2002. Edited by James Montgomery. Leuven: Peeters Publishers and the Department of Oriental Studies, 2004. According to Ahmad Hasan, the majority view is split between two possibilities: that religiously binding consensus is the consensus of the entire Muslim community, or that religiously binding consensus is just the consensus of the religiously learned.Ahmad Hasan, \\"The Doctrine of Ijma': A Study of the Juridical Principle of Consensus,\\" New Delhi, India: Kitab Bhaban, 2003, pg.81 The names of two kinds of consensus are: * ijma al-ummah - a whole community consensus. * ijma al-aimmah - a consensus by religious authorities. =Shia view= Initially, for Shia the authority of the Imams rendered the consensus as irrelevant. With the development of sectarian communities of Imami Shƒ´a Islam, the question of guidance and interpretation between different ulamas became an issue, however the importance of ijmƒÅ never reached the level and certainty it had in Sunni Islam. Later, since Safavid and with the establishment of Usuli school at the turn the 19th century the authority of living mujtahid is accepted, however it dies with him. For Shia, the status of ijmƒÅ is ambiguous. =Mu'tazilite view= The ancient Mu'tazilite sect did not consider consensus to be a valid source of law, primarily due to their rationalist criticism of the first generation of Muslims, whom the Mu'tazila viewed as possessing defective personalities and intellects.Devin Stewart, \\"Muhammad b. Dawud al- Zahiri's Manual of Jurisprudence.\\" Taken from Studies in Islamic Law and Society Volume 15: Studies in Islamic Legal Theory. Edited by Bernard G. Weiss. Pg. 107. Leiden: 2002. Brill Publishers. Shi'ite theologians Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid and Sharif al-Murtaza held the Mu'tazilite theologian Nazzam's book Kitab al-Nakth, in which his student Al-Jahiz reports that he denied the validity of consensus for this reason, in high esteem.Josef van Ess, Das Kitab al-nakt des Nazzam und seine Rezeption im Kitab al-Futya des Gahiz. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck & Reprecht, 1971. Modern scholarship has suggested that this interest was motivated by the desire of Shi'ite theologians to impugn the character of the first three leaders of the Rashidun Caliphate, Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman.

They have been described as one of the most innovative and commercially successful acts of all time. Rolling Stone called them \\"innovative, precise yet sensual, calculated yet galvanizing\\" and declared that the band \\"changed the sound of black pop\\". VH1 has also described EWF as \\"one of the greatest bands\\" ever. The band was founded in Chicago by Maurice White in 1969, having grown out of a previous band known as the Salty Peppers. As well other prominent members of EWF have included Philip Bailey, Verdine White, Ralph Johnson, Larry Dunn, Al McKay, Roland Bautista, Robert Brookins, Sonny Emory, Fred Ravel, Ronnie Laws, Sheldon Reynolds and Andrew Woolfolk. The band is known for its kalimba sound, dynamic horn section, energetic and elaborate stage shows, and the contrast between Philip Bailey's falsetto vocals and Maurice White's baritone. The band has won six Grammys from their 17 nominations and four American Music Awards out of 12 nominations. They have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the NAACP Image Award Hall of Fame, and Hollywood's Rockwalk, in addition to receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With sales of over 90 million records, they are one of the world's best-selling bands of all time. The band has also received an ASCAP Rhythm & Soul Heritage Award, BET Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Soul Train Legend Award, as well as a NARAS Signature Governor's Award, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, the 2012 Congressional Horizon Award, and the Kennedy Center Honors in 2019, along with Sally Field, Linda Ronstadt, Sesame Street and Michael Tilson Thomas. History=1969‚Äì1970: Beginnings= In 1969, Maurice White, a former session drummer for Chess Records and former member of the Ramsey Lewis Trio, joined two friends in Chicago, Wade Flemons and Don Whitehead, as a songwriting team composing songs and commercials in the Chicago area. The three friends eventually got a recording contract with Capitol Records. Calling themselves \\"The Salty Peppers\\", they went on to have a marginal hit single in the Midwestern area titled \\"La La Time\\". The Salty Peppers' second single, \\"Uh Huh Yeah\\", did not fare as well. Maurice moved on from Chicago to Los Angeles. He added to the band singer Sherry Scott and percussionist Yackov Ben Israel, both from Chicago, and then asked his younger brother Verdine how he would feel about heading out to the West Coast. On June 6, 1970, Verdine left Chicago to join the band as their new bassist. Maurice began shopping demo tapes of the band, featuring Donny Hathaway, around to different record labels and the band was eventually signed to Warner Bros. Records. =1970‚Äì1974: Formation and early years= Maurice's astrological sign, Sagittarius, has a primary elemental quality of Fire and seasonal qualities of Earth and Air, according to classical triplicities. Sagittarius in the northern hemisphere occurs in the autumn, whose element is earth, and in the southern hemisphere, it is spring, whose element is air. Hence the omission of Water, the fourth classical element. Based on this, he changed the band's name, to \\"Earth, Wind & Fire\\". Maurice held further auditions in L.A. where he added Michael Beal on guitar, Chester Washington on reeds, and Leslie Drayton on trumpet. With Maurice as a percussionist and lead vocalist Drayton also served as the group's musical arranger. Trombonist Alex Thomas completed the then ten-man EWF lineup. Warner Bros also designated Joe Wissert to be the band's producer. The band's self-titled debut album was released in February 1971 on Warner Bros. The album got to No. 24 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and has been certified Gold in France by the SNEP. Lester Bangs of Rolling Stone noted a \\"heavy Sly influence\\" and the \\"smooth harmonies\\" of The Fifth Dimension on the LP. Bob Talbert of the Detroit Free Press also wrote \\"I'm not sure what to call this group. Afro-gospel-jazz-blues-rock? Must there be a label?\\". EWF went on to perform the entire soundtrack of the Melvin Van Peebles feature film Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song. The soundtrack, composed by Van Peebles, was released in April 1971 on Stax Records. The album reached No. 13 on the Billboard Top R&B; Albums chart. In November 1971, EWF's second album titled The Need of Love was issued. The LP got to No. 35 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. Bruce Lindsay of Jazz Journal called The Need of Love \\"a worthwhile album\\". Al Rudis of The Chicago Sun Times also wrote the LP \\"works beautifully and while the elements of Earth, Wind & Fire aren't new, this mixture of them is a unique sound\\". A single from the album called \\"I Think About Lovin' You\\" reached No. 44 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. The band developed a growing popularity on college campuses but, in spite of this, some members of EWF started to become restless. As such the band eventually split apart. With only Verdine left, Maurice decided to re-form the group. During 1972, Maurice added vocalist Helena Davis, Ronnie Laws on the flute and saxophone, rhythm guitarist Roland Bautista, keyboardist Larry Dunn, vocalist Philip Bailey and percussionist Ralph Johnson to the group. Davis was soon replaced by Jessica Cleaves, a former member of the R&B; group The Friends of Distinction. The band successfully auditioned for managers Bob Cavallo and Joe Ruffalo. Cavallo's management of John Sebastian led to a series of gigs as the opening act for the pop/folk singer and The Lovin' Spoonful founder. A performance at New York's Rockefeller Center introduced EWF to Clive Davis, then the President of Columbia Records. Davis was very impressed with the band's performance and bought out their contract from Warner Bros. Wissert also, went along with the band to Columbia, as their producer. Their debut album on CBS/Columbia Records, Last Days and Time was issued in October 1972. The album got to No. 15 on the US Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 9 on the UK Blues & Soul Top British Soul Albums chart. Paul Sexton of Record Mirror proclaimed \\"Musical historians and EW&F; fans alike will welcome\\" Last Days and Time. Ovid Goode Jr. of The Los Angeles Daily News also declared that the LP is full of \\"moving tunes\\" that \\"sprouts forth with a fresh sound which sets it apart from many of the ho-hum aggregations around today\\". A single called \\"Mom\\" got to No. 39 on the Cashbox Top R&B; Singles chart. Soon thereafter, Roland Bautista and Ronnie Laws left the band to pursue new musical opportunities. Denver native Philip Bailey recommended his former East High School classmate, saxophonist Andrew Woolfolk as a replacement for Laws. Woolfolk had been busy in New York studying sax with sax maestro Joe Henderson and was due to start a career in banking at the time. To fill the void created by Bautista's departure, rhythm guitarists Al McKay and Johnny Graham were added to round out the new lineup. Graham previously played with the R&B; group New Birth while McKay was a former member of the Ike and Tina Turner Revue and The Watts 103rd St. Rhythm Band. EWF's fourth studio album Head to the Sky was released in May 1973. The album rose to No. 2 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 27 on the Billboard 200 chart. Head to the Sky has also been certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA. Vince Aletti of Rolling Stone declared that EWF \\"sound like a cosmic choir and generate a Sly Stone effect\\" on an album that's \\"certainly beyond all expectations\\". Variety also described the record as \\"a movin' new package. A single off the LP titled \\"Evil\\" got to No. 19 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Songs and No. 25 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs charts respectively. Another single called \\"Keep Your Head to the Sky\\" rose to No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. Jessica Cleaves left the band after the release of this album. The band's follow-up album was co-produced by Maurice and Joe Wissert. This LP was recorded at Colorado's Caribou Ranch Studio and issued under the title of Open Our Eyes in March 1974. Ken Emerson of Rolling Stone called Open Our Eyes \\"a pleasant miscellany of Africana, Latin rhythms, well-mannered funk, smooth jazz, Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder and the Fifth Dimension\\". The Village Voices Robert Christgau also described the album as a complete \\"tour de force\\". The album rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 15 on the Billboard 200 chart. Open Our Eyes was certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA. A single from the LP called \\"Mighty Mighty\\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Another single titled \\"Kalimba Story\\" rose to No. 6 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. A song called \\"Devotion\\" also got to No. 23 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 33 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. After Open Our Eyes was issued, Maurice's younger brother, Fred White, joined the band. He had previously played in Chicago clubs as a drummer with Donny Hathaway and Little Feat. On April 6, 1974, EWF performed at the California Jam, a West Coast rock festival that attracted an audience of 200,000. The concert was televised in the US on May 10, 1974 by ABC. In September 1974, a compilation double album titled Another Time with all the songs from EWF's first two studio albums was released by Warner Bros. The album got to No. 29 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart. The band then collaborated with Ramsey Lewis on his album Sun Goddess which was produced by Maurice and issued in late 1974 by Columbia. The album got to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 12 on the Billboard 200 chart. The LP's title track rose to No. 20 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. Sun Goddess was certified Gold in the US by the RIAA. =1975‚Äì1980: Ornate sound= During 1975, EWF was approached by Sig Shore, producer of the motion picture Super Fly, to record the soundtrack to a new film titled That's the Way of the World. With a screenplay from Robert Lipsyte, the film was produced and directed by Shore. The film starred Harvey Keitel, Ed Nelson, EWF as \\"The Group\\" and Maurice as Early, \\"The Group\\"'s leader. Keitel played the role of a record producer who hears \\"The Group\\" performing and is wowed by their act. When the band saw the film they were convinced that it would become a box office bomb, which it eventually was. They therefore released the film's soundtrack before the film's premiere. The LP was produced by White and Charles Stepney and recorded at the Caribou Ranch Studio. Stepney had previously worked with artists such as the Dells, Terry Callier and Minnie Riperton and the collective group the Rotary Connection, of which Riperton was a member. Stepney's writing and production style included a more ornate, orchestral flourish, which influenced the production of the soundtrack album. That's the Way of the World was eventually issued in March 1975 by Columbia. The album rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Top Soul Albums charts. Stephen Curwood of the Boston Globe called the LP \\"a sound you shouldn't miss.\\" Daryl Easlea of the BBC also described That's the Way of the World as a \\"soul masterpiece.\\" The album was certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. From the LP came the single \\"Shining Star\\", which rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts. By this achievement, EWF became the first black act to top both the Billboard album and singles charts. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. The album's second single was title track \\"That's the Way of the World\\". It reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 12 on the Hot 100 chart. With the album's success the band was able to hire their own horn section, dubbed the Phenix Horns. They were composed of saxophonist Don Myrick, trombonist Louis Satterfield, and trumpeters Rahmlee Davis and Michael Harris. Myrick and Satterfield had both previously worked with White during his days as a session drummer at Chess Records. After their first tour of Europe, EWF returned to the studio in June 1975 for a follow-up release. The band eventually came away with an album of mostly live concert material together with some newly recorded tracks. As a double LP the new album titled Gratitude was issued in November 1975. It rose to No. 1 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Soul Albums charts respectively. The album was certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. With the LP came the song \\"Sing a Song\\", which rose to numbers 1 and 5 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. The single \\"Can't Hide Love\\" got to No. 11 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. \\"Can't Hide Love\\" was Grammy nominated for Best Arrangement For Voices. The album's title track was also nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. During 1975, White also established a production company called Kalimba Productions. Artists such as his former bandleader Ramsey Lewis; singer Deniece Williams, who had once been a member of Stevie Wonder's \\"Wonderlove\\" backup group; and girl group the Emotions, were signed to the production company. Maurice loaned the band's signature Phenix Horns and most of the other band members and put these and others artists who were signed to Kalimba Productions on tour with EWF. While co-producing and arranging EWF's follow-up LP, Williams's debut album, This Is Niecy, Ramsey Lewis's Salongo, and the Emotions' Flowers, their first album on Columbia Records, Charles Stepney died of a heart attack on May 17, 1976 in Chicago at the age of 43. With Stepney's death, White went on to produce on his own the band's new LP, Spirit, which was issued in October 1976. With the album's title EWF paid tribute to Stepney. The LP rose to No. 2 on both the Billboard Top Pop Albums and Top Soul Albums charts. Craig Werner of Vibe called Spirit \\"one of the group's defining moments\\" and \\"gospel soul for the ages.\\"John Rockwell of The New York Times also declared \\"what is most interesting about Maurice White and his musicians..is their refusal to be locked into any stylistic format.\\" Spirit was certified double platinum in the US by the RIAA. A single off the LP called \\"Getaway\\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart. The song also rose to No. 12 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Dance Club Play charts. Another single titled \\"Saturday Nite\\" reached numbers 4 and 21 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs and Hot 100 charts respectively. \\"Saturday Nite\\" also rose to No. 12 on both the Billboard Dance Club Songs and UK Pop Singles charts respectively. The album cut \\"Earth, Wind and Fire\\" was Grammy nominated for Best Instrumental Composition. During this period, EWF concerts started to become loaded with pyrotechnics, magic, laser lights, flying pyramids, levitating guitarists and elaborate production tricks that included the entire group ascending in a pyramid and a disappearing act. The stage magician Doug Henning was thus with many of their tours with his young assistant and eventual successor, David Copperfield. The band also began to be choreographed by George Faison. In November 1977, EWF released All 'n All, their eighth studio album. It was inspired via a month long trip by Maurice White through Argentina and Brazil. The album rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. John Rockwell of The New York Times declared \\"All ‚Äòn All shows Maurice White and his cohorts pushing their music ever more in a febrile jazz‚Äêrock direction.\\" Monroe Anderson of The Chicago Tribune also called the album as a \\"rare blend of poetry, passion and artistic progression.\\" All 'n All won a Grammy for Best R&B; Vocal Performance By A Duo, Group Or Chorus. The album was certified triple platinum in the US by the RIAA. A song from the LP called \\"Serpentine Fire\\" rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Another single titled \\"Fantasy\\" reached No. 12 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 14 on the UK Singles Chart. \\"Fantasy\\" was Grammy nominated in the category of Best R&B; Song. A track off the LP called \\"Runnin\\" won a Grammy Award for Best R&B; Instrumental. In April 1978, the band featured on Natalie Cole's special aired on CBS where they performed a medley. EWF also appeared in the July 1978 feature film Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band where they performed a cover of the Beatles' \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\". The song was eventually added to the film's soundtrack. However, the film was a commercial failure, as That's the Way of the World had been years before. EWF's rendition of \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\" was the biggest hit from the film's soundtrack, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard R&B; songs chart and No. 9 on the Billboard Pop singles chart. The song was Grammy-nominated in the category of Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus. It went on to win a Grammy for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s). The film's soundtrack was certified platinum in the US by the RIAA. In 1978, White established a vanity label of CBS titled The American Record Company (ARC), and alongside sound engineer George Massenburg, a new recording studio called 'The Complex' in West Los Angeles. In November 1978, EWF issued a compilation album on the new vanity label entitled The Best of Earth, Wind & Fire, Vol. 1. It rose to No. 3 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart. The album was certified quintuple platinum in the U.S. by the RIAA. A single titled \\"September\\" rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"September\\" also reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. In January 1979, the band performed \\"September\\" and \\"That's the Way of the World\\" at the Music for UNICEF Concert. The concert was broadcast worldwide from the United Nations General Assembly by NBC. Other artists who performed at the event were ABBA, the Bee Gees, Olivia Newton- John, Donna Summer and Rod Stewart. The concert was Emmy-nominated in the category of Outstanding Individual Achievement - Special Class. During June 1979, EWF issued their ninth studio album, I Am. The LP rose to No. 1 on the Billboard Top Soul Albums chart and No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart. I Am was certified double platinum in the US by the RIAA. Connie Johnson of The Los Angeles Times proclaimed that the album was \\"freshly innovative for EW&F.;\\" Eric Sieger of The Baltimore Sun also described I Am as being \\"faultlessly produced.\\" A song from the LP titled \\"Boogie Wonderland\\", featuring the Emotions, got to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot Soul Songs chart and No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was also Grammy nominated in the categories of Best Disco Recording and Best R&B; Instrumental Performance. Another single called \\"After the Love Has Gone\\" reached No. 2 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Soul Songs charts. The song also reached No. 3 on both the Billboard Adult Contemporary Songs and UK Pop Singles charts. The ballad was Grammy- nominated in the category of Record of the Year. \\"After the Love Has Gone\\" also won a Grammy for the Best R&B; Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. During October 1980, EWF issued a double album titled Faces. This LP was in the emerging post-disco style and was partly recorded on the Caribbean island of Montserrat.

The cemetery is located between South Slope/Greenwood Heights, Park Slope, Windsor Terrace, Borough Park, Kensington, and Sunset Park, and lies several blocks southwest of Prospect Park. It is generally bounded by 20th Street to the northeast, Fifth Avenue to the northwest, 36th and 37th Streets to the southwest, Fort Hamilton Parkway to the south, and McDonald Avenue to the east. Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in 1838 as a rural cemetery, in a time of rapid urbanization when churchyards in New York City were becoming overcrowded. Described as \\"Brooklyn's first public park by default long before Prospect Park was created\\",, p.687. Green-Wood Cemetery was so popular that it inspired a competition to design Central Park in Manhattan, as well as Prospect Park nearby. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and was made a National Historic Landmark in 2006. In addition, the 25th Street gates, the Weir Greenhouse, and the Fort Hamilton Parkway Gate & Green-Wood Cemetery Chapel were separately designated as city landmarks by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission at various times.  Design  Richard Upjohn's memorial to Hezekiah Pierrepont and his family was built c. 1840s and sits on one of the few man-made hillocks in the cemetery Green-Wood's site is characterized by varied topography created by glacial moraines, particularly the Harbor Hill Moraine. Battle Hill (also known as Gowan's Heights), the highest point in Brooklyn, is on cemetery grounds, rising approximately above sea level. It was the site of an important action during the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776. A Revolutionary War monument by Frederick Ruckstull, Altar to Liberty: Minerva, was erected there in 1920. From this height, the bronze Minerva statue gazes towards the Statue of Liberty across New York Harbor. Green-Wood was less inspired by P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, which at the time retained the primarily axial formality of Alexandre Th√©odore Brongniart's original design,Plan of P√®re Lachaise in 1824 than by Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where a cemetery in a naturalistic park-like landscape in the English manner was first established.Moylan, Richard J. \\"Green-Wood Cemetery\\" in , pp. 557-58 It has been called \\"Brooklyn's first public park by default long before Prospect Park was created.\\" The architecture critic Paul Goldberger, quoting The New York Times from 1866, observed that \\"it is the ambition of the New Yorker to live upon the Fifth Avenue, to take his airings in the [Central] Park, and to sleep with his fathers in Green-wood\\". Green-Wood Cemetery contains 600,000 graves and 7,000 trees spread out over . The rolling hills and dales, several ponds, and an on-site chapel provide an environment that still draws visitors. In 2017 it received 280,000 visitors. Though at one point there were numerous gravediggers at Green-Wood, there were just a few gravediggers due to a decrease in the number of burials, as well as the limited amount of space for new burials. Because of this shortage of space, some plots are composed of \\"stacked\\" graves in which several family members may be buried atop each other. Several wooden shelters were also built, including one in a Gothic Revival style, one resembling an Italian villa, and another resembling a Swiss chalet. A descendant colony of monk parakeets that are believed to have escaped their containers while in transit now nests in the spires of the gate, as well as other areas in Brooklyn. The article presents information concerning the year-round tours led by Steve Baldwin in Brooklyn, New York to the nests of parrots. Baldwin volunteers to lead walking tours to the nests of an extended family of wild Quaker parrots that escaped from a shipping crate at JFK International Airport in the late 1960s. In 2008, Green-Wood started to acquire a collection of art pertaining to those buried in the cemetery. = Landscaping and circulation = Green-Wood Cemetery contains numerous landscape features, which in turn are named after terms that evoke a naturalistic scene. These names include Camellia Path, Halcyon Lake, Oaken Bluff, Sylvan Cliff, and Vista Hill. David Bates Douglass, Green-Wood's landscape architect, mostly kept the cemetery's natural landscaping intact. Much of Douglass's plan is still in place with its original plantings and curving-road systems. The original street names and original cast-iron perimeter fence have been retained, but many of the roads have been paved. The cemetery has been expanded several times. Most of these regions have been landscaped to resemble the original plot, except the area near Fort Hamilton Avenue to the north, which is flatter because it was acquired last. = Monuments = There are several famous monuments and mausoleums located there, designed in several architectural styles including the Classical, Egyptian, Gothic, and Romanesque styles. In addition, many tombs contain ornate sculptural decoration. The National Register of Historic Places designation subdivides these monuments into four primary categories: those honoring events or professions; those with architectural significance; those whose graves contain people of historical significance; and \\"monuments of sculptural interest\\". Among the first monuments was a statue of DeWitt Clinton, built in 1853. There is also a memorial erected by James Brown, president of Brown Brothers bank and the Collins Line, to the six members of his family lost in the disaster of 1854. This incorporates a sculpture of the ship, half- submerged by the waves, as well as a Civil War Memorial. During the American Civil War, Green-Wood Cemetery created the \\"Soldiers' Lot\\" for free veterans' burials; this lot included less than of land. In 1868-1876, after the war ended, the Civil War Soldiers' Monument was erected at the highest point in Green-Wood. Other monuments of note include the Pilot's Monument and the Sea Captain's Monument, each dedicated to a notable person in these respective professions. J. Marion Sims, a monument of gynecologist J. Marion Sims by Ferdinand Freiherr von Miller, is also planned to be installed in Green-Wood; the statue was formerly in Bryant Park and Central Park but was removed from the latter in 2017. Some elaborate monuments honor notable figures, such as William Niblo's Grand Gothic mausoleum, the Steinway & Sons family's Classical mausoleum, Abiel Abbot Low's tomb, and the Lispenard family's Norman-style mausoleum. Numerous other monuments to notable figures exist but are extremely simple in design, such as the tombs of Samuel Morse, William M. Tweed, Lola Montez, Henry Ward Beecher, and Currier and Ives. On the other hand, several monuments commemorate less well-known figures, including a Gothic memorial for 17-year-old Charlotte Canda, and a High Victorian pier designed by William or Edward Potter for their relatives. = Gates = The gates were designed by Richard Upjohn in Gothic Revival style. There are four gates in total. Two are city landmarks: the main gate at 25th Street to the northwest, which is closest to South Slope/Greenwood Heights, and Fort Hamilton Parkway to the south, which is in Kensington. Two additional gates exist. One of these, at 20th Street and Ninth Avenue, provides access from the northeast and is in Windsor Terrace. The other, at 34th Street and Fourth Avenue, provides access from the southwest and is located next to Sunset Park and the 36th Street station of the New York City Subway, serving the . These gates were developed from the 1840s to the 1860s. A fifth gate at Ninth Avenue and 37th Street no longer exists.  25th Street gate  The main entrance to the cemetery, a double-gate located at 25th Street and Fifth Avenue near its northwestern corner, was built in 1861‚Äì65, though the entrance itself opened in 1862. It is composed of Belleville, New Jersey brownstone. The sculptured groups on Nova Scotia limestone panels depicting biblical scenes of death and resurrection from the New Testament including Lazarus, The Widow's Son, and Jesus' Resurrection over the gateways are the work of sculptor John M. Moffitt. In between the two gateways is a clocktower in the Flamboyant style. A cemetery office is located to one side of the gate, while the chapel and reception room are located on opposite side. A Designated Landmarks of New York plaque was erected on it in 1958 by the New York Community Trust, and it was designated an official New York City landmark in 1966.  Fort Hamilton gate  Visitor building at Fort Hamilton entrance to Green-Wood Cemetery The Fort Hamilton gate is located at Fort Hamilton Parkway and Macieli Place. Similar to the 25th Street gate, it is made of a double gateway made of brownstone. It is also flanked by two structures, a visitor's lounge and the gatekeeper's residence. The gate was built in 1876 and completed the next year; it was designated as an official New York City landmark in 2016. To the east of the entrance is the visitor's lounge, a brownstone building. It is a -story structure with an entrance located inside a center bay on the west side of the building. The visitor's lounge contains two side bays, each with a porch, as well as restrooms for men and women. The hip roof is made of gray slate with metal ornamentation along the ridge at the top. The roof slopes down toward the perimeter walls of the building, though each of the four sides of the roof is punctuated by dormers with small windows. The corner porches feature stone banisters, and contain four yellow sandstone bas-reliefs sculpted by Moffitt. The west side of the entrance, also a brownstone structure, contains the gatekeeper's residence, a -story structure that is similar in design to the visitor's lounge. Only the center section is stories, while the two pavilions to the west and east are stories. The residence's main entrance is through the eastern pavilion, while there is another pavilion on the western facade. Both pavilions have hip roofs of gray slate, and the second floor contains dormers with windows that project from the hip roof. The central \\"tower\\" section contains entrances to both the north and south, as well as windows on the second, third, and attic floors that face north and south. The roof of the central tower contains a stone chimney. = Chapel = A side view of the chapel The Green-Wood Cemetery chapel is located near the 25th Street gate.\\"Chapel Services\\" Green-Wood Cemetery website Built in 1911‚Äì1913 by Warren and Wetmore, the chapel is located on the site of one of Green-Wood's original ponds. Though it is generally designed in the late Gothic style, its massing is in the Beaux-Arts style. It is made of limestone, and consists of multiple towers, including a central octagonal tower and four octagonal turrets, one at each corner. The chapel contains three levels: ground level, clerestory level, and the second story in the central tower. It is a reduced version of the upper sections of Christopher Wren's Tom Tower at Christ Church College in Oxford. Plans for the Green-Wood chapel date to shortly after the chapel's establishment, when a \\"Chapel Hill\\" was set aside within the cemetery. Though Richard Upjohn submitted plans for such a chapel in 1855, Green-Wood initially voted against such a chapel. A new location was selected near Arbor Water in the first decade of the 20th century, and plans were solicited from three firms in 1909. After Warren and Wetmore were selected, work started in 1911, and the chapel was officially opened in June 1913. The chapel was made a city landmark in 2016.  History = Founding and construction = Side view of the 25th Street entrance Following the founding of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Massachusetts in 1831, leaders of the cities of New York and Brooklyn began discussing locations to build a cemetery of their own. At the time, over 10,000 people were being buried per year in the two cities. The cemetery was the idea of Henry Evelyn Pierrepont, a Brooklyn social leader. As early as 1832, Pierrepont was considering constructing such a cemetery on a hilly area to the east of Gowanus Bay. Acts of incorporation for \\"The Greenwood Cemetery\\" were passed on April 18, 1838, entitling the corporation to a capital of $300,000 and the right to of land. On April 11, 1839, a modification to that act was enacted, changing the corporation to a nonprofit organization. Construction started in May 1839 and the first interment was performed on September 5, 1840. At that point, the cemetery commissioners decided to enclose the site with a long picket fence (later replaced with a metal fence in 1860). David Bates Douglass, Green-Wood's landscape architect, mostly kept the cemetery's natural landscaping intact, but worked on the cemetery until he resigned in 1841. Douglass modeled his two subsequently designed garden cemeteries upon Green-Wood: Albany Rural Cemetery (1845‚Äì1846), located in Menands, New York, and Mount Hermon Cemetery (1848), in Quebec City. Initially some of roads were paved inside Green-Wood to showcase its natural scenery. The earliest map dating from 1846 indicates that there were originally three ponds in Green-Wood: Sylvan Water, Green-Isle Water, and Arbor Water, all on the western side of the modern cemetery. Initially there were very few burials per year; by 1843, there had been 352 burials total, though the number of burials doubled just in the next year. Throughout the 1840s, several churches were allocated plots in Green-Wood Cemetery These included the Presbyterian, Unitarian, and German Lutheran churches of Brooklyn. By the 1850s, various fauna were being introduced to the cemetery. After the initial opening of Green-Wood Cemetery, it was expanded multiple times. Originally 175 acres were enclosed, stretching between 21st and 37th Streets from 5th to 9th Avenue. The first additional acquisition in 1847 was for at the southwest corner of the cemetery, adjacent to the contemporary border of the city of Brooklyn. Another to the east was acquired in 1852 through the annexation of land in the then-separate village of Flatbush. Finally, in 1858 another was acquired at the southeastern corner of the cemetery grounds. A plot at the southeast corner of the cemetery was purchased in 1863, allowing the commissioners to straighten out that border. This era was also associated with the construction of other structures. A receiving tomb was installed in 1853, and around the same time, the ponds were cleaned and landscaped. In addition, several gates to the cemetery were added. The main gate at 5th Avenue and 25th Street was built in 1861-65, followed by other entrances near the cemetery's service yard; at 9th Avenue and 20th Street; and at 9th Avenue and 37th Street (later removed). In addition, a gatekeeper's house was installed at the original southern entrance in 1848, the \\"Thirty Vaults\\" catacombs in 1854, and a well house in 1855. Furthermore, the paths were paved in the 1860s to allow for easier transport within the cemetery. Several additional ponds were carved out through the 1870s, including Border Water, Dell Water, Crescent Water, Dale Water, and Meadow Water. = Growing popularity = Governor DeWitt Clinton statue at Green-Wood Cemetery At first, lots were being sold for $100 apiece, and it soon became a frequent place for burials, with 7,000 annual burials and 100,000 graves by the 1860s. To accommodate those who came to the cemetery, a ferry service to the cemetery was established in 1846. Green-Wood became more popular after former governor DeWitt Clinton was disinterred from a cemetery in Albany, the New York state capital, and moved to Green-Wood, where a monument to him was erected in 1853. By the early 1860s it was drawing annual crowds second in size only to Niagara Falls. At the same time, Prospect Park was being constructed and public streetcar and elevated lines were established across Brooklyn. In particular, the opening of the Fifth Avenue Elevated station at 25th Street, near the main entrance, proved to be a benefit to lot owners in Green-Wood Cemetery. As a result, in 1876, Green-Wood built the Fort Hamilton gate to accommodate the anticipated extra crowds. By the end of the 19th century, several florists, greenhouses, and monument sellers had opened shops near each of the gates. One such structure was the Weir Greenhouse, located across from the 25th Street entrance; that building is now both a National Register of Historic Places listing and a city landmark. Improvements also continued throughout the late 19th century. In 1871, Border Water was partially eliminated to make extra burial space, and in 1874, the cemetery was slightly expanded to . Also, an underground drainage system, extra roads, and a permanent stone fence were built through the late 1870s. The cemetery was enlarged again in 1884 to via the acquisition of land on the northern border. To prevent the view being marred by the construction of tenements, Green-Wood also purchased lots on the southwest corner. By the 1890s, a reservoir was added atop Mt. Washington, the highest point in the cemetery, while two ponds had been removed. At the turn of the century, an old engine house, stables, and several enclosures were being removed, while waiting rooms and restrooms were added at the southern entrance. During this period, thousands of trees were planted, and roads continued to be graded. Mount Greenwood, Brooklyn, c. 1872‚Äì1887, by George Bradford Brainerd Most famous New Yorkers who died during the second half of the 19th century were buried at Green-Wood. Starting in 1862, free interments were offered to the families of New York soldiers who died in war. In 1868, work started on the installation of the Civil War Soldiers' Monument at the highest point in Green-Wood to commemorate hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who fought in the war. The monument was not dedicated until 1876. On December 5, 1876, the Brooklyn Theater Fire claimed the lives of at least 278 individuals, with some accounts reporting over 300 dead. Out of that total, 103 unidentified victims were interred in a common grave at Green-Wood Cemetery. An obelisk near the main entrance marks the burial site. = 20th century = Green-Wood has remained non-sectarian, but was generally considered a Christian burial place for white Anglo-Saxon Protestants of good repute. One early regulation was that no one executed for a crime, or even dying in jail, could be buried there. However, the family of infamous political leader \\"Boss\\" Tweed managed to circumvent this rule even though he died in the Ludlow Street Jail.The Irish of Green-Wood Cemetery, Michael Burke, Irish America magazine The cemetery's chapel was completed in 1913 by Warren and Wetmore, on the site of Arbor Water. By 1916, the cemetery had 325,000 burials. Modifications to Green-Wood's landscape continued through the 20th century. In 1915, the entrance at 20th Street was realigned to connect with 9th Avenue/Prospect Park West (the entrance there being completed in 1926), and another pond was drained. The landscape was in decline by the late 1910s, but this was followed shortly after by dead-tree removals in the 1920s and a five-year road repaving project began in 1924. Road reconstructions continued through the mid-1930s and demolition of enclosures continued. Notably, the clock tower at the 34th Street entrance was demolished in 1941, and iron fences were removed during World War II for the war effort. The old main entrance was demolished in 1951, and four years later, the first new crematorium in New York City in a half-century was built at Green-Wood, with a columbarium. By the end of the 1950s, another reservoir had been filled for new lots. More than 1,000 enclosures were removed from 1950 to 1961, the same year that work on a new crematorium began. The columbarium was expanded from 1975 to 1977. However, through the 1970s, vandalism was common at Green- Wood Cemetery. The cemetery was also affected by labor strikes among the gravediggers in 1966, 1973, and 1982. The cemetery also continued to add new structures: the Garden Mausoleum and Community Mausoleum were finished in the late 1980s, and the Hillside Mausoleum was expanded. In addition, in 1994, the north gate was restored and new offices were built. This was followed by the restoration of the chapel in the late 1990s, and it reopened in 2000 after having been closed for four decades. = 21st century = Koi pond in the cemetery In 1999, The Green-Wood Historic Fund, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit institution, was created to continue preservation, beautification, educational programs and community outreach as the current \\"working cemetery\\" evolves into a Brooklyn cultural institution. The Historic Fund's Civil War Project, an effort to identify and remember Civil War veterans buried at Green-Wood, was created following the rededication ceremony of the Civil War Soldiers' Monument. These early graves had either sunk into the soil, been damaged, or had their markers erased before the monument was restored between 2000 and 2002. Further, construction of the last phase of the Hillside Mausoleum began in 2001, and the same year 50 victims of the September 11 attacks were buried there. By 2009, there was little space for new interments at Green-Wood Cemetery. In December 2010, a memorial was unveiled for the 134 victims of the 1960 New York mid-air collision; the cemetery contains the common grave in which were placed the remains of unidentified victims . On October 13, 2012, another Angel of Music was installed to replace the one vandalized in 1959, this one made by sculptors Giancarlo Biagi and Jill Burkee, was unveiled to memorialize Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Two weeks later, Hurricane Sandy toppled or damaged at least 292 of the mature trees, 210 gravestones, and 2 mausoleums in the cemetery. The damage was estimated at $500,000. In December 2012 the statue The Triumph of Civic Virtue by Frederick MacMonnies was moved to Green- Wood. In August 2013, in partnership with the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati, signage in the Battle Hill area of the cemetery was updated to reflect new research on Battle Hill's importance in the Battle of Brooklyn.  Notable burials  Among the burials at the cemetery are six British Commonwealth service personnel whose graves are registered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, three from World War I and three from World War II.CWGC Cemetery Report. Breakdown obtained from casualty record.  Landmark designations  The gates of the cemetery were designated a New York City landmark in 1966,, p. 250 and the Weir Greenhouse, used as a visitor's center, was designated as such in 1982. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997 and was granted National Historic Landmark status in 2006 by the U.S. Department of the Interior. The Fort Hamilton Parkway Gate and the cemetery's chapel were designated as official New York City landmarks in 2016.  Gallery  File:Monument of Miss Charlotte Canda, Battle Avenue, by E. & H.T.

The band was formed in 1988 by vocalist and guitarist Nick Hexum, lead guitarist Jim Watson (a member briefly, before being replaced by Tim Mahoney in 1990), bassist Aaron \\"P-Nut\\" Wills, and drummer Chad Sexton. In 1992, Doug \\"SA\\" Martinez joined to sing and provide turntables for 311's later albums. 311 has released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, four compilation albums, four EPs and four DVDs. After a series of independent releases, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records in 1992 and released the albums Music (1993) and Grassroots (1994) to moderate success. They achieved greater success with their 1995 triple platinum self-titled album, which reached number 12 on the Billboard 200 on the strength of the singles \\"Down\\" and \\"All Mixed Up\\", the former of which topped the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks in 1996. The band's next three albums‚ÄîTransistor (1997), Soundsystem (1999) and From Chaos (2001)‚Äîwere also successful, with the first going platinum and the last two going gold. Their 2004 compilation album Greatest Hits '93‚Äì'03 was also certified platinum. The band's most recent studio album is 2019's Voyager. As of 2011, 311 has sold over 8.5 million records in the United States. The band's name originates from the police code for indecent exposure in Omaha, Nebraska, after the original guitarist for the band was arrested for streaking. History=Early recordings (1988‚Äì1992)= 311's first independent release was the Downstairs EP, which was recorded in 1989 in Nick Hexum's basement. Unlike many of their releases, it had no cover art. It features the song \\"Feels So Good,\\" which was recreated/remastered in the album Music, and a staple of most of 311's live shows. In 1990, 311 produced their second independent release, Dammit!, recorded at IEV Studios in Papillion, Nebraska. In 1991, Tim Mahoney replaced Jim Watson on guitar and 311 released their third independent release, Unity, recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios in Omaha, which was released with greater numbers than Dammit!. While Dammit! only printed 300 cassettes, Unity had 1000 CDs and 500 cassettes printed and was distributed through consignment and also sold at shows. The band began to headline shows in local clubs, such as The Ranch Bowl and Sokol Auditorium. In 1992, S.A. Martinez, who had been making various appearances with 311 over the past years as a vocalist, was officially asked to join the band. 311 recorded a six-track demo, called Hydroponic, also recorded at Rainbow Recording Studios, and moved to Los Angeles. Within their first few months, 311 was signed to Capricorn Records. 311 considers their first show to be held on June 10, 1990, opening for Fugazi in Omaha, Nebraska, at the Sokol Auditorium. =Music and Grassroots (1993‚Äì1994)= Their first major record, Music was released in 1993. The single \\"Do You Right\\" received airplay on modern rock stations and reached No. 27 on Billboard's Modern Rock Tracks chart. However, the album failed to chart at the time. Also notable, the album was produced by Eddie Offord, who famously produced Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Financing their own tour, the band drove around in an old RV borrowed from Sexton's father, and towed a Volkswagen bus which held their equipment. After tackling a steep incline while en route to an Omaha show, the RV caught fire. The only door out of the vehicle was surrounded by flames so the band jumped through the fire. All of their equipment and possessions were lost, though no one was seriously injured. The band continued their tour, using borrowed equipment. The following year, they released their second studio album, Grassroots. =Mainstream breakthrough (1995‚Äì2001)= In 1995, 311 released the self- titled 311 (also known as The Blue Album). Produced by Ron St. Germain, the album was recorded live in contrast to their previous two albums in which all instruments were recorded separately. The first single \\"Don't Stay Home\\" was a modest success, reaching No. 29 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. But the follow-up single \\"Down\\", which was released 14 months after the album, received heavy airplay on mainstream radio, and the accompanying music video was on MTV's rotation. The song hit No. 1 on the Modern Rock chart. The band made their network television debut on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on August 23. The third single, \\"All Mixed Up\\", enjoyed almost identical success, reaching No. 4 on the Modern Rock chart. They also appeared on Late Show with David Letterman playing \\"Down\\". In the following years, 311 continued touring and on August 5, 1997, they released Transistor which debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200, their highest position on that chart. The album went platinum. In 1998, 311 released Live, a live album from a 1997 performance in New Orleans, Louisiana. 311 also released Omaha Sessions, a compilation album from their early independent releases. In 1999, 311 released their fifth major album, Soundsystem. The song \\"Come Original\\" reached No. 6 on Billboards Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single, \\"Flowing\\", had American Pie's Eddie Kaye Thomas featured in the music video. In 1995, the band purchased a recording studio in North Hollywood, California, called The Hive. The band has recorded every album at The Hive since 2000, beginning with the sessions for From Chaos, 311's sixth major record release. From Chaos was released in late 2001. Its first single, \\"You Wouldn't Believe\\" featured basketball star Shaquille O'Neal in the video. =Evolver and Don't Tread on Me (2002‚Äì2006)= Their seventh major release, Evolver (Produced By Ron Saint Germain), came in 2003. In Summer 2003, 311 launched their inaugural Unity Tour. The tour included openers G. Love & Special Sauce, OAR and Something Corporate. In 2004, 311 covered The Cure's \\"Love Song\\" which became a No. 1 hit on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. It also reached No. 59 on the Billboard Hot 100, their first single to reach that chart. It was featured on the soundtrack for the motion picture 50 First Dates and then a few months later on their own Greatest Hits '93-'03. The compilation featured two new songs: \\"How Do You Feel?\\" and \\"First Straw\\". In Summer 2004, 311 played a free show at a city park in Omaha for that city's 175th Anniversary Celebration, where they changed all the weed lyrics in the songs they played for the show, then the band kicked off their second annual Unity Tour with openers The Roots and Medeski Martin & Wood. On August 16, 2005, 311 released their eighth studio album, titled Don't Tread on Me. \\"Don't Tread on Me\\", the first single, reached No. 2 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart and No. 7 at Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles. In mid-2005, 311 kicked off their third annual Unity Tour with openers Papa Roach and Unwritten Law. On July 20, 2006, 311 kicked off their Summer Unity Tour, playing 37 shows in 27 states and featuring opening bands Pepper and Wailers. After completion of the tour, 311 announced they would be taking a break, their first official one in over eight years. =Uplifter and Universal Pulse (2007‚Äì2011)= In January 2007, 311 stepped back into their Hive Studios with Nick's younger brother Zack Hexum. They recorded a cover of Toots & the Maytals song \\"Reggae Got Soul\\" for the soundtrack from the film Surf's Up, which was released on June 5, 2007. 311 is also one of bands that have been able to successfully tour \\"off-cycle\\", headlining amphitheaters each summer. Their Summer Unity Tour in 2007 included supporting acts Matisyahu and The English Beat. In 2008, they featured opening acts Snoop Dogg and Fiction Plane. In 2009, they had another Summer Unity Tour which featured opening acts Ziggy Marley and The Expendables while in 2010, supporting act The Offspring and opening act Pepper were featured. In 2011, Sublime With Rome and DJ Soulman & DJ Trichrome were the openers on the Unity Tour. Uplifter, 311's ninth studio album, was released on June 2, 2009. The album, produced at 311's Hive Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Bob Rock, debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, the band's highest chart position in the U.S. to date. The band followed up the release of the album with tours in Summer and Fall 2009. They have completed their Spring 2010 tour, which included 311 Day 2010, held in Las Vegas, Nevada. A Summer tour with The Offspring began in June 2010. 311 also held a 2010 fall tour. In early 2011, 311 finished recording their tenth studio album called Universal Pulse at the Hive in Los Angeles, with producer Bob Rock. The album was released July 19, 2011. The album's first single, \\"Sunset in July\\" was released on June 3, 2011. Universal Pulse is their shortest album yet, only having 8 songs. =Stereolithic, Archive Compilation and Mosaic (2012‚Äì2017)= In Summer 2012, 311 embarked on their tenth annual Unity Tour with Slightly Stoopid, SOJA, and The Aggrolites. On August 24, 2012, Doug \\"SA\\" Martinez told Phoenix's Up on the Sun that an eleventh 311 studio album was in the works and planned for release in 2013. However, on July 15, 2013, their eleventh album was announced to be released on March 11, 2014, to coincide with 311 Day 2014. According to P-Nut, the album is to have \\"darker themes\\", and was produced by Scotch Ralston. On July 2, 2013, 311 started their eleventh annual Unity Tour with Cypress Hill and G. Love & Special Sauce. The tour ended on August 4, 2013. Stereolithic, the band's first independently released studio album since 1991's Unity, was released on March 11, 2014. On November 18, 2014, 311 released a live album, 311 with the Unity Orchestra ‚Äì Live from New Orleans ‚Äì 311 Day 2014. The album documents part of the 311 Day 2014 concert wherein the band was accompanied onstage by a symphony orchestra for nine songs. 311 Archive, a four disc compilation album featuring 81 previously unreleased songs, b-sides and demos, was released on June 30, 2015. As of February 2016, according to Nick Hexum, 311 was working on a new album, and in February 2017, the band revealed the new album's title, Mosaic, on their PledgeMusic update feed. Six song titles were released to the public, \\"Hey Yo\\", \\"Island Sun\\", \\"Extension\\", \\"Too Much to Think\\", \\"Syntax Error\\", and \\"Too Late\\"; with the first two being debuted at 311 Day 2016. 311 invited their fan base to submit a photo of themselves to be featured on the album artwork. Mosaic was released on June 23, 2017, and was met with positive reviews. It was their 12th studio album and their 10th consecutive to debut in the Top 10 of US Billboard 200. It debuted at number six, with 39,000 album-equivalent units, of which 37,000 were pure album sales. On March 9, 2017, the band released \\"Too Much to Think\\", the first single from Mosaic. Following that, 311 released singles \\"Too Late\\" and \\"Perfect Mistake\\" =Voyager and next album (2018‚Äìpresent)= In 2018, 311 and The Offspring toured together on the Never-Ending Summer tour. That summer, The Offspring released a cover of 311's \\"Down\\" and 311 released a \\"reggaefied\\" cover of The Offspring's \\"Self Esteem\\". Hexum states that 311 has \\"the bulk of an album written\\" and is working with producer/co- writer John Feldmann of Goldfinger on some tracks. Later that summer, Mahoney confirmed that they were working with both Scotch Ralston and John Feldmann on Voyager. Voyager released on July 12, 2019. The documentary Enlarged to Show Detail 3 was released to theaters for one day only on March 11, 2019. When asked in an interview with PRS Guitars, conducted on March 11, 2020 (311 Day), if 311 were planning to make a new live album or follow-up to Voyager, guitarist Tim Mahoney said, \\"This year is all about playing live and celebrating 30 years. Although we do have a few blocks of time set aside for new music writing and recording, the soonest for any new release would be 2021.\\" As part of their 30th anniversary tour, the band was scheduled to co- headline a North American trek with Incubus in the summer of 2020, but it was cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 311 Day On March 11, 2000, 311 began celebrating an unofficial holiday of their own creation, which they called 311 Day. The band chose the date because March 11 is written in the United States as 3/11. Every other year on March 11, the band performs an extended concert for thousands of their fans. In 2000, the band played 47 songs. In 2002, they increased the set list to 59 songs. In 2004, 311 played 68 songs. The band played entire albums, rarities and covers. Later that year, a DVD was released of the performance that contained 64 of the 68 songs. 311 Day in 2006 was held at the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, Tennessee, where the band played 65 songs. The intended set list was cut short from 69 songs because of a strict midnight curfew. The band recorded the entire show in high definition,and a 2-hour edit of the show aired on HDTV on December 10. In 2008, 311 Day was held in the New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. Over three separate sets, the band played 63 songs to a sold-out crowd of 14,000 fans, who represented all 50 states and 13 countries. In 2010, 311 Day took place at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. All 60 songs, 32 of which were different from 311 Day in 2008, were broadcast live on the web in a video on demand format described as a \\"professional multi-camera HD production.\\" In 2012, 311 Day took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas and, for the first time, was split into two days. The band performed 79 songs during the two-day concert. On July 3, 2013, the band announced at the Unity Tour show in Chicago that 311 Day 2014 would be returning to New Orleans. 311 Day 2016 took place in New Orleans, at the Smoothie King Center (New Orleans Arena) on November 3, 2016 & December 3, 2016. 311 Day 2018 took place on 3/10 and 3/11 in Las Vegas at the Park Theatre at the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino. 86 songs were played, including a cover of Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\" with an In Memoriam video tribute to late musicians and 311 fans Renee O'Neal, Meredith Hight, and Nick Hexum's youngest brother Patrick. 311 Caribbean Festival Cruises and 311 Pow Wow Festival In March 2011, 311 began hosting a Festival Cruise. The environment is similar to an outdoor music festival involving camping. The 2011 Caribbean Festival Cruise departed on March 3, 2011 from Miami, FL aboard the Carnival Destiny for Grand Turk, Turk and Caicos. The festival cruise featured three shows, over four days leaving from Miami to Turks and Caicos, and featured guest bands: The Movement, DJ Soulman and Nocturnal Arts, Full Service, Pepper and The Expendables. On May 10, 2012, 311 hosted their second Caribbean Festival Cruise on the Carnival Destiny, departing from Miami and landing on a private island, Half Moon Cay, in the Bahamas for three consecutive nights and featured guest bands including: The Dirty Heads, Shwayze, 2 Skinnee J's, DJ Soulman, Outlaw Nation, Shootyz Groove, BALLYHOO!, Passafire, Cisco, Full Service, DJ Trichrome, Exes Of Evil, Trailer Park Ninjas, Moral Defect among others. 311's 2013 Caribbean Festival Cruise departed Miami on March 1, 2013 on its new home, the Norwegian Pearl, but this time went to a different private island in the Bahamas, Great Stirrup Cay. The 2013 Caribbean Cruise featured guest bands and comedians including: Rebelution, Less Than Jake, Exes of Evil, DJ ABD, The Urge, Tom Green, Doug Benson, SA Martinez and Exes of Evil performing in their side project Ghostwolf. DJ Kilmore (From Incbus), BALLYHOO!, Badfish: A Tribute to Sublime, Bad Rabbits, The Aggrolites, DJ Soulam, Full Service, J Randy, Krooked Treez, Beat Squad, Trailer Park Ninjas, Hey Monea, DJ Trichome, DJ ABD 311's 2015 Caribbean Festival departed from Miami on February 25, 2015 aboard the Norwegian Pearl. It made port in Jamaica. The line up included 311 with three sets, Dirty Heads, Pepper, Chali 2na, RX Bandits, The Green, RDGLDGRN, Full Service, The Funk Hunters, Doug Benson, DJ Soulman, J Randy, Andy Haynes, Papafish, Beatcake, Singles, Tony Hinchcliffe, DJ Native Wayne, DJ Trichrome, The Unity All Stars, Headphone Disco among others. 2017 marked the fifth 311 Caribbean Cruise! Departed from Tampa to Cozumel, March 2‚Äì6, 2017, on board the Norwegian Jade as the Pearl was in drydock. Lineup of bands, DJs and comedians, including Rebelution, Reel Big Fish, Stick Figure, People Under the Stairs, Ballyhoo!, RDGLDGRN, Los Stellarians (side project of 311 member SA Martinez) and ILL Communication. The band headlined set lists as usual and hosted other bands as well. 311 played their hit songs plus debuting two new tracks; \\"Extension\\" and \\"Too Late\\" while also covering Prince's \\"Let's Go Crazy\\". 311 hosted their first \\"Pow Wow\\" Festival from August 4 to 6, 2011, at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, FL. Along with 311, it featured DJ Trichome, Murs, SOJA, Deftones, DJ Soulman, The Movement, Full Service, Streetlight Manifesto, The Dirty Heads, Sublime with Rome, Shinobi Ninja, Ballyhoo!, The Supervillains, Ozomatli, G. Love & Special Sauce, and comedians Doug Benson and Graham Elwood. Along with fire performances by Nocturnal Arts. 311 played four sets and the album Transistor in its entirety. 311 business collaborations 311 sponsored the NASCAR stock car of Jeb Burton in 2015 Since 2015, the band has collaborated with Nebraska Brewing Company and Rock Brother Brewing on 311 Amber Ale. The beer is currently available in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Nebraska, and southern California with more midwest locations coming soon. That year they also released a cannabis vapor pen dubbed the \\"Grassroots Uplifter.\\" The pen is be available in Colorado, Washington, Oregon and California. In 2018, Grassroots Uplifter v2 was released in California. 311 are also official media sponsors for BK Racing on the NASCAR Sprint Cup series. The 311 logo appears on all BK Racing cars Musical style and influences 311's music is a blend of rock, reggae, hip hop and funk. 311 has been described as alternative rock, reggae rock, rap rock, funk metal, funk rock, rap metal, post-grunge, alternative metal and nu metal. 311's influences include The Clash, The Cure, Descendents, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Cypress Hill, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley, Fishbone, and Bad Brains.

Glial cells function to support neurons and in the PNS, also include satellite cells, olfactory ensheathing cells, enteric glia and glia that reside at sensory nerve endings, such as the Pacinian corpuscle. The two types of Schwann cells are myelinating and nonmyelinating. Myelinating Schwann cells wrap around axons of motor and sensory neurons to form the myelin sheath. The Schwann cell promoter is present in the downstream region of the human dystrophin gene that gives shortened transcript that are again synthesized in a tissue-specific manner. During the development of the PNS, the regulatory mechanisms of myelination are controlled by feedforward interaction of specific genes, influencing transcriptional cascades and shaping the morphology of the myelinated nerve fibers. Schwann cells are involved in many important aspects of peripheral nerve biology‚Äîthe conduction of nervous impulses along axons, nerve development and regeneration, trophic support for neurons, production of the nerve extracellular matrix, modulation of neuromuscular synaptic activity, and presentation of antigens to T-lymphocytes. Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease, Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and leprosy are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells. Structure Schwann cells are a variety of glial cells that keep peripheral nerve fibres (both myelinated and unmyelinated) alive. In myelinated axons, Schwann cells form the myelin sheath. The sheath is not continuous. Individual myelinating Schwann cells cover about 100 Œºm of an axon‚Äîequating to about 10,000 Schwann cells along a 1-m length of the axon. The gaps between adjacent Schwann cells are called nodes of Ranvier. 9-O-Acetyl GD3 ganglioside is an acetylated glycolipid which is found in the cell membranes of many types of vertebrate cells. During peripheral nerve regeneration, 9-O-acetyl GD3 is expressed by Schwann cells. Function The vertebrate nervous system relies on the myelin sheath for insulation and as a method of decreasing membrane capacitance in the axon. The action potential jumps from node to node, in a process called saltatory conduction, which can increase conduction velocity up to 10 times, without an increase in axonal diameter. In this sense, Schwann cells are the PNS's analogues of the central nervous system's oligodendrocytes. However, unlike oligodendrocytes, each myelinating Schwann cell provides insulation to only one axon (see image). This arrangement permits saltatory conduction of action potentials with repropagation at the nodes of Ranvier. In this way, myelination greatly increases speed of conduction and saves energy.Kalat, James W. Biological Psychology, 9th ed. USA: Thompson Learning, 2007. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells are involved in maintenance of axons and are crucial for neuronal survival. Some group around smaller axons (External image here) and form Remak bundles. Myelinating Schwann cells begin to form the myelin sheath in mammals during fetal development and work by spiraling around the axon, sometimes with as many as 100 revolutions. A well-developed Schwann cell is shaped like a rolled-up sheet of paper, with layers of myelin between each coil. The inner layers of the wrapping, which are predominantly membrane material, form the myelin sheath, while the outermost layer of nucleated cytoplasm forms the neurilemma. Only a small volume of residual cytoplasm allows communication between the inner and outer layers. This is seen histologically as the Schmidt-Lantermann incisure. = Regeneration = Schwann cells are known for their roles in supporting nerve regeneration. Nerves in the PNS consist of many axons myelinated by Schwann cells. If damage occurs to a nerve, the Schwann cells aid in digestion of its axons (phagocytosis). Following this process, the Schwann cells can guide regeneration by forming a type of tunnel that leads toward the target neurons. This tunnel is known as band of B√ºngner, a guidance track for the regenerating axons, which behaves like an endoneural tube. The stump of the damaged axon is able to sprout, and those sprouts that grow through the Schwann-cell ‚Äútunnel‚Äù do so at the rate around 1 mm/day in good conditions. The rate of regeneration decreases with time. Successful axons can, therefore, reconnect with the muscles or organs they previously controlled with the help of Schwann cells, but specificity is not maintained and errors are frequent, especially when long distances are involved.Carlson, Neil R. Physiology of Behavior, 9th ed. USA: Pearson Education, Inc., 2007. Because of their ability to impact regeneration of axons, Schwann cells have been connected to preferential motor reinnervation, as well. If Schwann cells are prevented from associating with axons, the axons die. Regenerating axons will not reach any target unless Schwann cells are there to support them and guide them. They have been shown to be in advance of the growth cones. Schwann cells are essential for the maintenance of healthy axons. They produce a variety of factors, including neurotrophins, and also transfer essential molecules across to axons.A Schwann cell in culture.  Genetics = Schwann cell formation = Sox10  SOX10 is a transcription factor active during embryonic development and abundant evidence indicates that it is essential for the generation of glial lineages from trunk crest cells. When SOX10 is inactivated in mice, satellite glia and Schwann cell precursors fail to develop, though neurons are generated normally without issue. In the absence of SOX10, neural crest cells survive and are free to generate neurons, but glial specification is blocked. SOX10 might influence early glial precursors to respond to neuregulin 1 (see below).  Neuregulin 1  Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) acts in a number of ways to both promote the formation and ensure the survival of immature Schwann cells. During embryonic development, NRG1 inhibits the formation of neurons from neural crest cells, instead contributing to neural crest cells being led down a path to gliogenesis. NRG1 signaling is not, however, required for glial differentiation from the neural crest. NRG1 plays important roles in the development of neural crest derivatives. It is required for neural crest cells to migrate past the site of dorsal root ganglia to find the ventral regions of sympathetic gangliogenesis. It is also an essential axon-derived survival factor and a mitogen for Schwann cell precursors. It is found in the dorsal root ganglion and motor neurons at the point in time that Schwann cell precursors begin to populate spinal nerves and therefore influences Schwann cell survival. In embryonic nerves, the transmembrane III isoform likely is the primary variant of NRG1 responsible for survival signals. In mice that lack the transmembrane III isoform, Schwann cell precursors are eventually eliminated from spinal nerves. = Formation of myelin sheath = P0  Myelin protein zero (P0) is a cell-adhesion molecule belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the major component of peripheral myelin, constituting over 50% of the total protein in the sheath. P0 has been shown to be essential for the formation of compact myelin, as P0 null mutant (P0-) mice showed severely aberrant peripheral myelination. Although myelination of large caliber axons was initiated in P0- mice, the resulting myelin layers were very thin and poorly compacted. Unexpectedly, P0- mice also showed degeneration of both axons and their surround myelin sheaths, suggesting that P0 plays a role in maintaining the structural integrity of both myelin formation and the axon with which it‚Äôs associated. P0- mice developed behavioral deficits around 2 weeks of age when mice began to show signs of slight trembling. Gross incoordination also arose as the animals developed, while trembling became more severe and some older mice developed convulsing behaviors. Despite the array of impaired motor behavior, no paralysis was observed in these animals. P0 is also an important gene expressed early within the Schwann cell lineage, expressed in Schwann cell precursors after differentiating from migrating neural crest cells within the developing embryo.  Krox-20  Several important transcription factors are also expressed and involved at various stages in development changing the features on the Schwann cells from an immature to mature state. One indispensable transcription factor expressed during the myelination process is Krox-20. It is a general zinc-finger transcription factor and is expressed in the rhombomeres 3 and 5. Krox-20 is considered as one of the master regulators of PNS myelination and is important in driving transcription of specific structural proteins in the myelin. It has been shown to control a set of genes responsible for interfering with this feature in the axon changing it from a pro-myelinating to myelinating state. In this way, in Krox-20 double knock out mice, it has been recorded that hindbrain segmentation is affected as well as myelination of Schwann cell associated axons. Indeed, in these mice, the Schwann cells are not able to perform their myelination properly as they only wrap their cytoplasmic processes one and half turn around the axon and despite the fact that they still express the early myelin marker, late myelin gene products are absent. In addition, recent studies have also proven the importance of this transcription factor in maintaining the myelination phenotype (and requires the co-expression of Sox 10) as its inactivation leads to dedifferentiation of the Schwann cells. Clinical significance Charcot‚ÄìMarie‚ÄìTooth disease (CMT), Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome (GBS, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy type), schwannomatosis, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), leprosy, and Zika Virus are all neuropathies involving Schwann cells. =Transplantation= A number of experimental studies since 2001 have implanted Schwann cells in an attempt to induce remyelination in multiple sclerosis-afflicted patients. In the past two decades, many studies have demonstrated positive results and potential for Schwann cell transplantation as a therapy for spinal cord injury, both in aiding regrowth and myelination of damaged CNS axons. Schwann cell transplants in combination with other therapies such as Chondroitinase ABC have also been shown to be effective in functional recovery from spinal cord injury.

As part of Interstate 80 and the direct road between San Francisco and Oakland, it carries about 260,000 vehicles a day on its two decks. It has one of the longest spans in the United States. The toll bridge was conceived as early as the California Gold Rush days, but construction did not begin until 1933. Designed by Charles H. Purcell, and built by American Bridge Company, it opened on Thursday, November 12, 1936, six months before the Golden Gate Bridge. It originally carried automobile traffic on its upper deck, with trucks, cars, buses and commuter trains on the lower, but after the Key System abandoned rail service, the lower deck was converted to all-road traffic as well. In 1986, the bridge was unofficially dedicated to James Rolph. The bridge has two sections of roughly equal length; the older western section, officially known as the Willie L. Brown Jr. Bridge (after former San Francisco Mayor and California State Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr.), connects downtown San Francisco to Yerba Buena Island, and the newer unnamed eastern section connects the island to Oakland. The western section is a double suspension bridge with two decks, westbound traffic being carried on the upper deck while eastbound is carried on the lower one. The largest span of the original eastern section was a cantilever bridge. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a portion of the eastern section's upper deck collapsed onto the lower deck and the bridge was closed for a month. Reconstruction of the eastern section of the bridge as a causeway connected to a self-anchored suspension bridge began in 2002; the new eastern section opened September 2, 2013, at a reported cost of over $6.5 billion, a 2,500% cost overrun from the original estimate of $250 million (for a seismic retrofit of the existing span). Unlike the western section and the original eastern section of the bridge, the new eastern section is a single deck with the eastbound and westbound lanes on each side making it the world's widest bridge, according to Guinness World Records, as of 2014. Demolition of the old east span was completed on September 8, 2018. Background Bridges crossing San Francisco Bay The bridge consists of two crossings, east and west of Yerba Buena Island, a natural mid-bay outcropping inside San Francisco city limits. The western crossing between Yerba Buena and downtown San Francisco has two complete suspension spans connected at a center anchorage. Rincon Hill is the western anchorage and touch-down for the San Francisco landing of the bridge connected by three shorter truss spans. The eastern crossing, between Yerba Buena Island and Oakland, was a cantilever bridge with a double-tower span, five medium truss spans, and a 14-section truss causeway. Due to earthquake concerns, the eastern crossing was replaced by a new crossing that opened on Labor Day 2013. On Yerba Buena Island, the double-decked crossing is a concrete viaduct east of the west span's cable anchorage, the Yerba Buena Tunnel through the island's rocky central hill, another concrete viaduct, and a longer curved high-level steel truss viaduct that spans the final to the cantilever bridge.\\"Yerba Buena Crossing (Contract No. 04-5)As Built Drawings\\" Caltrans 2006 The toll plaza on the Oakland side (since 1969 for westbound traffic only) has eighteen toll lanes, of which six are FasTrak-only. Metering signals are about west of the toll plaza. Two full-time bus-only lanes bypass the toll booths and metering lights around the right (north) side of the toll plaza; other high occupancy vehicles can use these lanes during weekday morning and afternoon commute periods. The two far-left toll lanes are high-occupancy vehicle lanes during weekday commute periods. Radio and television traffic reports will often refer to congestion at the toll plaza, metering lights, or a parking lot in the median of the road for bridge employees; the parking lot is about long, stretching from about east of the toll plaza to about west of the metering lights. During the morning commute hours, traffic congestion on the westbound approach from Oakland stretches back through the MacArthur Maze interchange at the east end of the bridge onto the three feeder highways, Interstate 580, Interstate 880, and I-80 toward Richmond. Since the number of lanes on the eastbound approach from San Francisco is structurally restricted, eastbound backups are also frequent during evening commute hours. The western section of the Bay Bridge is currently restricted to motorized freeway traffic. Pedestrians, bicycles, and other non-freeway vehicles are not allowed to cross this section. A project to add bicycle/pedestrian lanes to the western section has been proposed but is not finalized. A Caltrans bicycle shuttle operates between Oakland and San Francisco during peak commute hours for $1.00 each way. Freeway ramps next to the tunnel provide access to Yerba Buena Island and Treasure Island. Because the toll plaza is on the Oakland side, the western span is a de facto non-tolled bridge; traffic between the island and the main part of San Francisco can freely cross back and forth. Those who only travel from Oakland to Yerba Buena Island, and not the entire length to the main part of San Francisco, must pay the full toll. History San Francisco, at the entrance to the bay, was perfectly placed to prosper during the California Gold Rush. Almost all goods not produced locally arrived by ship. But after the first transcontinental railroad was completed in May 1869, San Francisco was on the wrong side of the Bay, separated from the new rail link. The fear of many San Franciscans was that the city would lose its position as the regional center of trade. The concept of a bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay had been considered since the Gold Rush days. Several newspaper articles during the early 1870s discussed the idea. In early 1872, a \\"Bay Bridge Committee\\" was hard at work on plans to construct a railroad bridge. The April 1872 issue of the San Francisco Real Estate Circular contained an item about the committee: The self-proclaimed Emperor Norton saw fit to decree three times in 1872 that a suspension bridge be constructed to connect Oakland with San Francisco. In the third of these decrees, in September 1872, Norton, frustrated that nothing had happened, proclaimed: Sketch of the proposed \\"Rush San Francisco Trans-Bay Suspension Bridge\\" (1913) Unlike most of Emperor Norton's eccentric ideas, his decree to build a bridge had wide public and political appeal. Yet the task was too much of an engineering and economic challenge, since the bay was too wide and too deep there. In 1921, over forty years after Norton's death, a tube was considered, but it became clear that one would be inadequate for vehicular traffic. Support for a trans-bay crossing finally grew in the 1920s with the increasing popularity and availability of the automobile. =Planning= Preliminary layout studies for the bridge A law became effective in 1929 to establish the California Toll Bridge Authority (Stats. 1929, Chap 763) and to authorize it and the State Department of Public Works to build a bridge connecting San Francisco and Alameda County (Stats. 1929, Chap 762).Statutes of California, 48th Session, 1929, Chaps. 762-3, p.1489California Highways and Public Works, May-June, 1929, p.15 A commission was appointed to evaluate the idea and various designs for a bridge across the Bay, the Hoover-Young Commission. Its conclusions were made public in 1930.California Highways and Public Works, December, 1930, p.8 In January 1931, Charles H. Purcell, the State Highway Engineer of California, assumed the position of Chief Engineer for the Bay Bridge. To make the bridge feasible, a route was chosen via Yerba Buena Island, which would reduce both the material and the labor needed. Since Yerba Buena Island was a U.S. Navy base at the time, the approval of the U.S. Congress, which regulates the armed services and supervises all naval and military bases, was necessary for this island to be used. After a great deal of lobbying, California received Congressional approval to use the island on February 20, 1931, subject to the final approval of the Departments of War, Navy and Commerce.U.S. Statutes at Large, 71st Congress, Chap.238, pp.1192-3 Permits were immediately applied for from the 3 federal departments as required. The permits were granted in January, 1932, and formally presented in a ceremony on Yerba Buena Island on February 24, 1932.[California Highways and Public Works, February, 1932, p.22] On May 25, 1931, Governor James Rolph Jr. signed into law two acts: one providing for the financing of state bridges by revenue bonds, and another creating the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge Division of the State Department of Public Works. On September 15, 1931, this new division opened its offices at 500 Sansome Street in San Francisco.California Highways and Public Works, November, 1936, p.12 During 1931, a series of aerial photographs was taken of the chosen route for the bridge and its approaches.\\"Aerial photographs of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Approaches-1931\\", Fairchild Aerial Surveys Inc. The final design concept for the western span between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island was still undecided in 1931, although the idea of a double-span suspension bridge was already favored.California Highways and Public Works, June, 1931, p.5 In April 1932, the preliminary final plan and design of the bridge was presented by Chief Engineer Charles Purcell to Col. Walter E. Garrison, Director of the State Department of Public Works, and to Ralph Modjeski, head of the Board of Engineering Consultants. Both agencies approved and preparation of the final design proceeded.California Highways and Public Works, October, 1931, p.12California Highways and Public Works, April, 1932, p.22 =Construction= The Bay Bridge under construction at Yerba Buena Island in 1935 Before work got underway, 12 massive underwater telephone cables were moved 1,000 feet north of the proposed bridge route by crews of the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Co. during the summer of 1931.\\"Spectacular Job at Bottom of Sea; 10 Boals, 33 Men Remove Phone Cables\\", California Highways and Public Works, July, 1931, p.12-13 Construction began on July 9, 1933. Ultimately, twenty- four men would die constructing the bridge. The western section of the bridge between San Francisco and Yerba Buena Island presented an enormous engineering challenge. The bay was up to deep in places and the soil required new foundation-laying techniques. A single main suspension span some in length was considered but rejected, as it would have required too much fill and reduced wharfage space at San Francisco, had less vertical clearance for shipping, and cost more than the design ultimately adopted.Leboski, pp. 339‚Äì40 The solution was to construct a massive concrete anchorage halfway between San Francisco and the island, and to build a main suspension span on each side of this central anchorage.\\"World's Largest Bridge rest on sunken skyscrapers\\" Popular Science, February 1935 East of Yerba Buena Island, the bay to Oakland was spanned by a combination of double cantilever, five long-span through-trusses, and a truss causeway, forming the longest bridge of its kind at the time. The cantilever section was longest in the nation and third-longest anywhere.Petroski, p. 340 Much of the original eastern section was founded upon treated wood pilings. Because of the very deep mud on the bay bottom it was not practical to reach bedrock, although the lower levels of the mud are quite firm. Long wooden pilings were crafted from entire old-growth Douglas fir trees, which were driven through the soft mud to the firmer bottom layers.Reisner, p. 113 =Approaches= A double balanced cantilever bridge, five truss bridges, and two truss causeways that connected Yerba Buena Island to Oakland. Demolished in 2016. The original western approach to (and exit from) the upper deck of the bridge was a long ramp to Fifth, branching to Harrison St for westward traffic off the bridge and Bryant St for eastward traffic entering. There was an on-ramp to the upper deck on Rincon Hill from Fremont Street (which later became an off-ramp) and an off-ramp to First Street (later extended over First St to Fremont St). The lower deck ended at Essex and Harrison St; just southwest of there, the tracks of the bridge railway left the lower deck and curved northward into the elevated loop through the Transbay Terminal that was paved for buses after rail service ended.\\"The old Transbay Terminal: When trains came first\\", San Mateo Daily Journal online edition, September 24, 2018 The eastern approach to the bridge included a causeway landing for the \\"incline\\" section, and the construction of three feeder highways, interlinked by an extensive interchange,California Highways and Public Works, November, 1936, p.27 which in later years became known as \\"The MacArthur Maze\\". A massive landfill was emplaced, extending along the north edge of the existing Key System rail mole to the existing bayshore, and continuing northward along the shore to the foot of Ashby Avenue in Berkeley.\\"'Great Fill and Wall for Bay Bridge Approach\\", California Highways and Public Works, Dec. 1933, p.13 The fill was continued northward to the foot of University Avenue as a causeway which enclosed an artificial lagoon, subsequently developed by the WPA as \\"Aquatic Park\\". The 3 feeder highways were U.S. 40 (Eastshore Highway) which led north through Berkeley, U.S. 50 (38th Street, later MacArthur Blvd.) which led through Oakland, and State Route 17 which ran parallel to U.S. 50, along the Oakland Estuary and through the industrial and port sections of the city. =Yerba Buena Tunnel= Traveling through the westbound Yerba Buena tunnelThe Yerba Buena passage utilizes the Yerba Buena Tunnel, wide, high, and long. It is the largest diameter transportation bore tunnel in the world. The large amount of material that was excavated in boring the tunnel was used for a portion of the landfill over the shoals lying adjacent to Yerba Buena Island to its north, a project which created the artificial Treasure Island. Reminders of the long-gone bridge railway survive along the south side of the lower Yerba Buena Tunnel. These are the regularly spaced refuge bays (\\"deadman holes\\"), escape alcoves common in all railway tunnels, along the wall, into which track maintenance workers could safely retreat if a train came along. (The north side, which always carried only motor traffic, lacks these holes.)State of California, Dept. of Public Works, Tunnel Section and Details, Yerba Buena Crossing, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, June 1934, Sup. Drawing No. 19A, PDF p.28 =Opening day= The bridge opened on November 12, 1936, at 12:30 p.m. In attendance were the former US president Herbert Hoover, Senator William G. McAdoo, and the Governor of California, Frank Merriam. Governor Merriam opened the bridge by cutting gold chains across it with an acetylene cutting torch. The San Francisco Chronicle report of November 13, 1936, read: Embarcadero in San Francisco Schematic drawing of the Bay Bridge The total cost was US$77 million. Before opening the bridge was blessed by Cardinal Secretary of State Eugene Cardinal Pacelli, later Pope Pius XII. Because it was in effect two bridges strung together, the western spans were ranked the second and third largest suspension bridges. Only the George Washington Bridge had a longer span between towers. As part of the celebration a United States commemorative coin was produced by the San Francisco Mint. A half dollar, the obverse portrays California's symbol, the grizzly bear, while the reverse presents a picture of the bridge spanning the bay. A total of 71,369 coins were sold, some from the bridge's tollbooths. Roadway plan Until the 1960s the upper deck ( wide between curbs) carried three lanes of traffic in each direction and was restricted to automobiles only. The lower deck carried three lanes of truck and bus traffic, with autos allowed, on the north side of the bridge. In the 1950s traffic lights were added to set the direction of travel in the middle lane, but there still remained no divider. Two interurban railroad tracks on the south half of the lower deck carried the electric commuter trains.Ford, Robert S. Red Trains in the East Bay (1977) Interurbans Publications p.258 In 1958 the tracks were replaced with pavement, but the reconfiguration to what the traffic eventually became did not take place until 1963. The Federal highway on the bridge was originally a concurrency of U.S. Highway 40 and U.S. Highway 50. The bridge was re-designated as Interstate 80 in 1964, and the western ends of U.S. 40 and U.S. 50 are now in Silver Summit, Utah, and West Sacramento, California, respectively. The off-ramp for Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island is unusual in that it is on the left-hand side in the eastbound direction. This off ramp presents an unusual hazard ‚Äì drivers must slow within the normal traffic flow and move into a very short off-ramp that ends in a short radius turn left turn; accordingly, a 15 MPH advisory is posted there. The turn has been further narrowed from its original design by the installation of crash pads on the island side. Eastbound and westbound on- ramps are on the usual right-hand side, but these do not have dedicated merge lanes, forcing drivers to await gaps in traffic and then accelerate from a stop sign to traffic speeds in a short distance. In 2016, a new on-ramp and off-ramp to Treasure Island were opened in the western direction on the right- hand side of the roadway, replacing the left-hand side off-ramp in that direction. =Rail service= On January 14, 1939, the San Francisco Transbay Terminal was dedicated. The following morning, January 15, 1939, the electric commuter trains started running across the south side of the lower deck of the bridge. The terminal originally was supposed to open the same time as the Bay Bridge, but was delayed. The trains were operated by the Sacramento Northern Railroad (Western Pacific), the Interurban Electric Railway (Southern Pacific) and the Key System. Freight trains never used the bridge. The tracks left the lower deck in San Francisco just southwest of the end of 1st St. They then went along an elevated viaduct above city streets, looping around and into the terminal on its east end. Departing trains exited on the loop back onto the bridge.\\"Building Bay Bridge Railroad\\", California Highways and Public Works, v.16 no.5, May, 1938, pp.8-11 The loop continued to be used by buses until the terminal's closure in 2010. The tracks left the lower deck in Oakland. The Interurban Electric Railway tracks ran along Engineer Road and over the Southern Pacific yard on trestles (some of it is still standing and visible from nearby roadways) onto the streets and dedicated right-of-ways in Berkeley, Albany, Oakland and Alameda. The Sacramento Northern and Key System tracks went under the SP tracks through a tunnel (which still exists and is in use as an access to the EBMUD treatment plant) and onto 40th St. Due to falling ridership, Sacramento Northern and IER service ended in 1941.Red Trains in the East Bay, Robert Ford, Interurbans Special 65, 1977 After World War II Key System ridership began to fall as well.The Key Route, Harre Demoro, Interurbans Special 95, 1985 Despite the vital role the railroad played, the last train went over the bridge in April 1958. The tracks were removed and replaced with pavement on the Transbay Terminal ramps and Bay Bridge. The Key System handled buses over the bridge until 1960 when its successor, AC Transit, took over operations. It still handles service today. There have been several attempts to restore rail service on the bridge, but none have been successful. =Later events=Modification to remove rail service Daytime view of the Bay Bridge and San Francisco seen from Yerba Buena Island A view of the Bay Bridge from the Bank of America building Automobile traffic increased dramatically in the ensuing decades while the Key System declined, and in October 1963, the Bay Bridge was reconfigured with five lanes of westbound traffic on the upper deck and five lanes of eastbound traffic on the lower deck. The Key System originally planned to end train operations in 1948 when it replaced its streetcars with buses, but Caltrans did not approve of this. Trucks were allowed on both decks and the railroad was removed. Owing to a lack of clearance for trucks through the upper-deck portion of the Yerba Buena tunnel, it was necessary to lower the elevation of the upper deck where it passes through the tunnel, and to correspondingly excavate to lower the elevation of the lower portion. Additionally, the upper deck was retrofitted to handle the increased loads due to trucks, with understringers added and prestressing added to the bottom of the floor beams. This retrofit is still in place and is visible to Eastbound traffic. 1968 aircraft accident On February 11, 1968, a U.S. Navy training aircraft crashed into the cantilever span of the bridge, killing both reserve officers aboard. The T2V SeaStar, based at NAS Los Alamitos in southern California, was on a routine weekend mission and had just taken off in the fog from nearby NAS Alameda. The plane struck the bridge about above the upper deck roadway and then sank in the bay north of the bridge. There were no injuries among the motorists on the bridge. One of the truss sections of the bridges was replaced due to damage from the impact. Cable lighting The series of lights adorning the suspension cables was added in 1986 as part of the bridge's 50th-anniversary celebration. Ship accident In 2007, a container ship then named the Cosco Busan, and subsequently renamed the Hanjin Venezia, struck the bridge, resulting in the Cosco Busan oil spill. 2013 public \\"light sculpture\\" installation A view of Bay Bridge lights from a pier next to the Ferry Building in San Francisco On March 5, 2013, a public art installation called \\"The Bay Lights\\" was activated on the western span's vertical cables. The installation was designed by artist Leo Villareal and consists of 25,000 LED lights originally scheduled to be on nightly display until March 2015. However, on December 17, 2014, the non-profit Illuminate The Arts announced that it had raised the $4 million needed to make the lights permanent; the display was temporarily turned off starting in March 2015 in order to perform maintenance and install sturdier bulbs and then re-lit on January 30, 2016. In order to reduce driver distractions, the privately funded display is not visible to users of the bridge, only to distant observers. This lighting effort is intended to form part of a larger project to \\"light the bay\\".The Bay Lights (thebaylights.org) Villareal used various algorithms to generate patterns such as rainfall, reflections on water, bird flight, expanding rings, and others. Villareal's patterns and transitions will be sequenced and their duration determined by computerized random number generator to make each viewing experience unique.Bay Bridge light display dazzles San Francisco Includes video (following a too-long advertisement) Owing to the efficiency of the LED system employed, the estimated operating cost is only US$15.00 per night. Bus lane proposal In January 2020, the AC Transit and BART boards of directors supported the establishment of dedicated bus lanes on the bridge. In February 2020, Rob Bonta introduced state legislation to begin planning bus lanes. Earthquake damage and subsequent upgrades A collapsed section of roadway deck after the 1989 earthquake On the evening of October 17, 1989 during the Loma Prieta earthquake, which measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale, a section of the upper deck of the eastern truss portion of the bridge at Pier E9 collapsed onto the deck below, indirectly causing one death. The bridge was closed for just over a month as construction crews repaired the section. That same year, the bridge reopened to traffic on November 18. The lighter pavement of the replacement section is visible in aerial photographs at the east end of the through-truss part of the bridge (). =Western section retrofitting= The western section has undergone extensive seismic retrofitting. During the retrofit, much of the structural steel supporting the bridge deck was replaced while the bridge remained open to traffic. Engineers accomplished this by using methods similar to those employed on the Chicago Skyway reconstruction project. The entire bridge was fabricated using hot steel rivets, which are impossible to heat treat and so remain relatively soft. Analysis showed that these could fail by shearing under extreme stress. Therefore, at most locations each given rivet was removed by breaking off the head with a jack- hammer [rivet buster] and punching out the old rivet, the hole precision reamed and the old rivets replaced with heat-treated high-strength tension- control [TC] bolts and nuts. Most bolts had domed heads placed facing traffic so they looked similar to the rivets that were removed.[Caltrans contract 04-0435U4, 1999‚Äì2004]. This work had to be performed with great care as the steel of the structure had for many years been painted with lead based paint, which had to be carefully removed and contained by workers with extensive protective gear. laced ties (left, eastern span) and bolted box beam retrofit (right, western span) Most of the beams were originally constructed of two plate -beams joined with lattices of flat strip or angle stock, depending upon structural requirements. These have all been reconstructed by replacing the riveted lattice elements with bolted steel plate and so converting the lattice beams into box beams. This replacement included adding face plates to the large diagonal beams joining the faces of the main towers, which now have an improved appearance when viewed from certain angles. Diagonal box beams have been added to each bay of the upper and lower decks of the western spans. These add stiffness to reduce side-to-side motion during an earthquake and reduce the probability of damage to the decking surfaces. Analysis showed that some massive concrete supports could burst and crumble under likely stresses. In particular the western supports were extensively modified. First, the location of existing reinforcing bar is determined using magnetic techniques. In areas between bars holes are drilled. Into these holes is inserted and glued an L-shaped bar that protrudes 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches). This bar is retained in the hole with a high-strength epoxy adhesive. The entire surface of the structure is thus covered with closely spaced protrusions. A network of horizontal and vertical reinforcing bars is then attached to these protrusions. Mold surface plates are then positioned to retain high-strength concrete, which is then pumped into the void. After removal of the formwork the surface appears similar to the original concrete. This technique has been applied elsewhere throughout California to improve freeway overpass abutments and some overpass central supports that have unconventional shapes. (Other techniques such as jacket and grout are applied to simple vertical posts; see the seismic retrofit article.) The western approaches have also been retrofitted in part, but mostly these have been replaced with new construction of reinforced concrete. =Eastern section replacement= For various reasons, the eastern section would have been too expensive to retrofit compared to replacing it, so the decision was made to replace it. The replacement section underwent a series of design changes, both progressive and regressive, with increasing cost estimates and contractor bids. The final plan included a single-towered self-anchored suspension span starting at Yerba Buena island, leading to a long inclined viaduct to the Oakland touchdown. Separated and protected bicycle lanes are a visually prominent feature on the south side of the new eastern section. The bikeway and pedestrian path across the eastern span opened in October 2016 and carries recreational and commuter cyclists between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island. The original eastern cantilever span had firefighting dry standpipes installed. No firefighting dry or wet standpipes were designed for the eastern section replacement, although, the firefighting wet standpipes do exist on the original western section visible on both the north-side upper and lower decks. The original eastern section closed permanently to traffic on August 28, 2013, and the replacement span opened for traffic five days later. The old original eastern section was dismantled between January 2014 and November 2017.

Working in parallel with the retrofit, California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and its contractors and subcontractors, were able to design, engineer, fabricate, and install the pieces required to repair the bridge, delaying its planned opening by only hours. The repair was not inspected by the Federal Highway Administration, which relied on state inspection reports to ensure safety guidelines were met. On October 27, 2009 during the evening commute, the steel crossbeam and two steel tie rods repaired over Labor Day weekend snapped off the Bay Bridge's eastern section and fell to the upper deck.Bay Bridge Closed for Eyebar Assessment and Repair Caltrans.

KGO-TV-7 ABC7News. October 28, 2009, 9:33 pm. Three vehicles were either struck by or hit the fallen debris, though there were no injuries. On November 1, Caltrans announced that the bridge would probably stay closed at least through the morning commute of Monday, November 2 after repairs performed during the weekend failed a stress test on Sunday. BART and the Golden Gate Ferry systems added supplemental service to accommodate the increased passenger load during the bridge closure. The bridge reopened to traffic on November 2, 2009. The pieces that broke off on October 27 were a saddle, crossbars, and two tension rods.KSBW Action News Sunrise (5-7am), October 28, 2009 Name A view of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge western span from the waterfront in San Francisco The bridge was unofficially \\"dedicated\\" to James B. \\"Sunny Jim\\" Rolph, Jr.,\\"Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California\\", California Department of Transportation, 2013, p. 43. but this was not widely recognized until the bridge's 50th-anniversary celebrations in 1986. The official name of the bridge for all functional purposes has always been the \\"San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge\\", and, by most local people, it is referred to simply as \\"the Bay Bridge\\". Rolph, a Mayor of San Francisco from 1912 to 1931, was the Governor of California at the time construction of the bridge began. He died in office on June 2, 1934, two years before the bridge opened, leaving the bridge to be named for him out of respect. In 1932, with an inability to finance the bridge, Joseph R. Knowland, (a former U.S. Congressman) travelled to Washington and helped to persuade President Herbert Hoover and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance $62 million for the building of the bridge. =Emperor Norton naming campaigns= In 1872, the San Francisco entrepreneur and eccentric Emperor Norton issued three proclamations calling for the design and construction of a suspension bridge between San Francisco and Oakland via Yerba Buena Island (formerly Goat Island).The Emperor Norton Trust, \\"Emperor Norton's Bridge Proclamations\\". A 1939 plaque honoring Emperor Norton for the original idea for the Bay Bridge was dedicated by the fraternal society E Clampus Vitus and was installed at The Cliff House in February 1955. In November 1986, in connection with the bridge's 50th anniversary, the plaque was moved to the Transbay Terminal, the public transit and Greyhound bus depot at the west end of the bridge in downtown San Francisco. When the terminal was closed in 2010, the plaque was placed in storage.\\"A Plaque in 1939\\", The Emperor Norton Trust There have been two recent campaigns to name all, or parts, of the Bay Bridge for Emperor Norton.Two Hits and a Pop Foul in 2004, The Emperor Norton Trust.The Petition and the Trust, The Emperor Norton Trust. =2004= In November 2004, after a campaign by San Francisco Chronicle cartoonist Phil Frank, then-San Francisco District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin introduced a resolution to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors calling for the entire two-bridge system, from San Francisco to Oakland, to be named for Emperor Norton.Resolution in Support of the Emperor Norton Bridge, introduced to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors by District 3 Supervisor Aaron Peskin, 2004. On December 14, 2004, the Board approved a modified version of this resolution, calling for only \\"new additions\\" ‚Äî i.e., the new eastern crossing ‚Äî to be named \\"The Emperor Norton Bridge\\". Neither the City of Oakland nor Alameda County passed any similar resolution, so the effort went no further. =2013= In June 2013, nine state assemblymen, joined by two state senators, introduced Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 65 (ACR 65) to name the western crossing of the bridge for former California Assembly Speaker and former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown.California Legislature, 2013‚Äì14 Regular Session, Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 65 ‚Äì Relative to the Willie L. Brown, Jr. Bridge, June 12, 2013. Six weeks later, a grassroots petition was launched seeking to name the entire two-bridge system for Emperor Norton.Justin Slaughter, \\"Petition to name Bay Bridge after Emperor Norton gains 1,000 signatures\\", San Francisco Bay Guardian, August 13, 2013. In September 2013, the petition's author launched a nonprofit, The Emperor's Bridge Campaign ‚Äî now known as The Emperor Norton Trust ‚Äî that advocates for adding \\"Emperor Norton Bridge\\" as an honorary name (rather than \\"renaming\\" the bridge) and that undertakes other efforts to advance Norton's legacy. =2014= The state legislative resolution naming the western section of the Bay Bridge the \\"Willie L. Brown, Jr., Bridge\\" passed the Assembly in August 2013 and the Senate in September 2013.Official California Legislative Information, \\"Documents associated with ACR 65\\", Legislative Counsel of California. A ceremony was held on February 11, 2014, marking the resolution and the installation of signs on either end of the section. The larger entity of which the western section is a part retains the separate and independent designation \\"San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge\\". =Alexander Zuckermann Bike Path= The pedestrian and bicycle route on the eastern section opened on September 3, 2013, and is named after Alexander Zuckermann, founding chair of the East Bay Bicycle Coalition. This forms a transbay route for the San Francisco Bay Trail. Until October 2016, the path did not connect to Yerba Buena and Treasure Island sidewalks, due to the need to demolish more of the old eastern section before final construction. As of December 2016, the path is open only on weekends and holidays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. \\"to ensure public safety during torch cutting and other old Bay Bridge demolition activities\\". On May 2, 2017, public access was extended to seven days a week, 6 a.m. to 9 p.m., with occasional closure days for continued demolition of the old bridge foundations. This work was completed on November 11, 2017. Financing and tolls=Two-way collection= When the Bay Bridge opened in 1936, the toll was 65 cents, collected in each direction by men in booths fronting each lane of traffic. Within months, the toll was lowered to 50 cents in order to compete with the ferry system, and finally to 25 cents since this was shown sufficient to pay off the original revenue bonds on schedule. In 1951 there were eighty collectors working various shifts.C.H. Garrigues, \\"Most Polite Man,\\" Nation's Business, February 1951, pages 72-74 =One-way collection= On Monday, September 1, 1969, (Labor Day) a change of policy resulted in the toll being collected thereafter only from westbound traffic, at twice the previous rate; eastbound vehicles were toll-exempt.\\"One-Way Tolls to Start Monday on All Bridges,\\" The Argus, Fremont, California, August 29, 1969, image 5 Tolls were subsequently raised to finance improvements to the bridge approaches, required to connect with new freeways, and to subsidize public transit in order to reduce the traffic over the bridge. Caltrans, the state highway transportation agency, maintains seven of the eight San Francisco Bay Area bridges. (The Golden Gate Bridge is owned and maintained by the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District.) The basic toll (for automobiles) on the seven state bridges was raised to $1 by Regional Measure 1, approved by Bay Area voters in 1988.Regional Measure 1 Toll Bridge Program. bata.mtc.ca.gov; Bay Area Toll Authority. A $1 seismic retrofit surcharge was added in 1998 by the state legislature, originally for eight years, but since then extended to December 2037 (AB1171, October 2001). On March 2, 2004, voters approved Regional Measure 2, raising the toll by another dollar to a total of $3. An additional dollar was added to the toll starting January 1, 2007, to cover cost overruns concerning the replacement of the eastern span. The Metropolitan Transportation Commission, a regional transportation agency, in its capacity as the Bay Area Toll Authority, administers RM1 and RM2 funds, a significant portion of which are allocated to public transit capital improvements and operating subsidies in the transportation corridors served by the bridges. Caltrans administers the \\"second dollar\\" seismic surcharge, and receives some of the MTC-administered funds to perform other maintenance work on the bridges. The Bay Area Toll Authority is made up of appointed officials put in place by various city and county governments, and is not subject to direct voter oversight. Due to further funding shortages for seismic retrofit projects, the Bay Area Toll Authority again raised tolls on all Bay Area bridges in its control (this excludes the Golden Gate Bridge) in July 2010. The toll rate for autos on other Bay Area bridges was increased to $5, but in the Bay Bridge a variable pricing tolling scheme based on congestion was implemented. The Bay Bridge congestion pricing scheme charges a $6 toll from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m., Monday through Friday. During weekends cars pay $5. Carpools before the implementation were exempted but now they pay $2.50, and the carpool toll discount is now also available only to drivers with FasTrak electronic toll devices. The toll remained at the previous toll of $4 at all other times on weekdays. The Bay Area Toll Authority reported that by October 2010 fewer users are driving during the peak hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge before and after the 5‚Äì10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect. Commute delays in the first six months dropped by an average of 15% compared with 2009. For vehicles with at least 3 axles, the toll rate is $5 per axle. In June 2018, Bay Area voters approved Regional Measure 3 to further raise the tolls on all seven of the state-owned bridges to fund $4.5 billion worth of transportation improvements in the area. Under the passed measure, the tolls on the Bay Bridge will be raised by $1 on January 1, 2019, then again on January 1, 2022, and again on January 1, 2025. Thus under the congestion pricing scheme, the tolls for autos during the peak weekday rush hours will be $7 in 2019, $8 in 2022, and $9 in 2025; for the non-rush periods, $5 in 2019, $6 in 2022, and $7 in 2025; and on weekends, $6 in 2019, $7 in 2022, and $8 in 2025. In September 2019, the MTC approved a $4 million plan to eliminate toll takers and convert all seven of the state-owned bridges to all-electronic tolling, citing that 80 percent of drivers are now using Fastrak and the change would improve traffic flow. On March 20, 2020, at midnight, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all-electronic tolling was temporarily placed in effect for all seven state-owned toll bridges.

The City of Austin created the reservoir in 1960 as a cooling pond for a new city power plant. The lake, which has a surface area of , is now used primarily for recreation and flood control. The reservoir is named in honor of former First Lady of the United States Lady Bird Johnson. Lady Bird Lake is the easternmost lake of a chain of reservoirs on the river, which is completely located in Texas, and should not be confused with the larger Colorado River located in the Southwestern United States. This chain, known locally as the Texas Highland Lakes, also includes Lake Buchanan, Inks Lake, Lake LBJ, Lake Marble Falls, Lake Travis, and Lake Austin. History Longhorn Dam impounds Lady Bird Lake. The City of Austin constructed Longhorn Dam in 1960 to form Town Lake. The city needed the reservoir to serve as a cooling pond for the Holly Street Power Plant, which operated from 1960 until 2007. Before 1971, the shoreline of Town Lake was mostly a mixture of weeds, unkempt bushes, and trash. Local television station KTBC referred to the lake as an \\"eyesore\\". Some concerned Austinites led small projects to clean up the lake. Roberta Crenshaw, chair of the Austin Board of Parks and Recreation, purchased nearly 400 trees and shrubs in an effort to spearhead parkland development around the lake. During his two terms in office (1971‚Äì75), the Mayor of Austin Roy Butler led the Austin City Council to establish the Town Lake Beautification Committee, and he appointed Lady Bird Johnson as the project's honorary chairman. Johnson's involvement brought attention and money (including $19,000 of her own) to the Town Lake project, allowing for the planting of hundreds of shrubs and trees.Wear, Ben. \\"Lady Bird helped turn Town Lake into town treasure\\". Austin American-Statesman, July 13, 2007. pA1, A6. The city also built a system of hike and bike trails along the shoreline of the lake. On July 26, 2007, the Austin City Council passed a controversial resolution authorizing the renaming of the reservoir from Town Lake to Lady Bird Lake in honor of Lady Bird Johnson, who had died earlier that month.Raskin, Amy (2007). \\"Austin changes Town Lake name to Lady Bird Lake\\". Houston Chronicle. July 26, 2007. Johnson had declined the honor of having the lake renamed for her while she was alive. In renaming the lake, the City Council recognized Johnson's dedication to beautifying the lake and her efforts to create a recreational trail system around the lake's shoreline.Wilson, Janet (2007). \\"Lady Bird Johnson dies at 94\\" . Austin American-Statesman. July 12, 2007. In 2009, non-profit organization Keep Austin Beautiful launched \\"Clean Lady Bird Lake\\". The program mobilizes thousands of community volunteers annually to conduct large-scale cleanups along the lake every other month and targeted cleanups throughout the year. Recreational uses East Riverside neighborhood. Lady Bird Lake is a major recreation area for the City of Austin. The lake's banks are bounded by the Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, and businesses offer recreational watercraft services along the lakefront portion of the trail. Austin's largest downtown park, Zilker Park, is adjacent to the lake, and Barton Springs, a major attraction for swimmers, flows into the lake. The City of Austin prohibits the operation of most motorized watercraft on Lady Bird Lake.Ellis, Luke (2006). \\"The Common Law: Boating on Town Lake ‚Äì What's the Law?\\" March 17, 2006. As a result, the lake serves as a popular recreational area for paddleboards, kayaks, canoes, dragon boats, and rowing shells. Austin's warm climate and the river's calm waters, nearly length and straight courses are especially popular with crew teams and clubs. Along with the University of Texas women's rowing team and coeducational club rowing team, who practice on Lady Bird Lake year-round, teams from other universities (including the University of Chicago, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of Nebraska) train on Lady Bird Lake during Christmas holidays and spring breaks. Other water sports along the shores of the lake include swimming in Deep Eddy Pool, the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Barton Springs Pool, a natural pool on Barton Creek which flows into Lady Bird Lake. Below Tom Miller Dam is Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 collapse of the McDonald Dam that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing.\\"Austin Parks and Recreation Department, Red Bud Isle\\" Swimming in Lady Bird Lake is illegal not due to poor water quality from the run-off from area streets, which is a false rumor, but rather due to several drownings as well as debris in the water from bridges and dams destroyed by floods in years past. The City of Austin enacted the ban in 1964, and the fine can be up to $500. Music venues on the banks of Lady Bird Lake are home to a number of events year-round, including the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the fall, the Austin Reggae Festival and Spamarama in the spring, and many open-air concerts at Auditorium Shores on the south bank and Fiesta Gardens on the north bank. The Austin Aqua Festival was held on the shores of Lady Bird Lake from 1962 until 1998. The late Austin resident and blues guitar legend, Stevie Ray Vaughan played a number of concerts at Auditorium Shores and is honored with a memorial statue on the south bank. =Ann and Roy Butler Hike- and-Bike Trail= Many Austinites take advantage of the Butler Trail to keep fit by walking, running or cycling. The Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail, formerly the Town Lake Hike and Bike Trail, creates a complete circuit around Lady Bird Lake. It is one of the oldest urban Texas hike and bike paths. The trail is the longest trail designed for non-motorized traffic maintained by the City of Austin Parks and Recreation Department. A local nonprofit, The Trail Foundation, is the Trail's private steward and has made Trail-wide improvements by adding user amenities and infrastructure including trailheads and lakefront gathering areas, locally-designed jewel box restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing trailwide ecological restoration work on an ongoing basis. The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile Boardwalk project, which was spearheaded by The Trail Foundation. The trail is long and mostly flat, with 97.5% of it at less than an 8% grade. The trail's surface is smooth and is mostly crushed granite except for a few lengths of concrete and a boardwalk on the South-side of the lake. A pedestrian bridge incorporated into the trail bridges Barton Creek. The Roberta Crenshaw Pedestrian Walkway spans Lady Bird Lake beneath MoPac Boulevard and provides the trail's westernmost crossing of Lady Bird Lake. =Fishing= Lady Bird Lake has been stocked with several species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. The predominant fish species in Lady Bird Lake are largemouth bass, catfish, carp, and sunfish. Fishing is regulated, requiring a fishing license, and daily bag and length limits apply for most species. A ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was issued by the City of Austin in 1990, as a result of excessively high levels of chlordane found in the fish.Texas Environmental Almanac .\\"Water Quality\\". Texas Environmental Almanac. ch. 2, p. 6. Although the use of chlordane as a pesticide was banned in the United States in 1988, the chemical sticks strongly to soil particles and can continue to pollute groundwater for years after its application. The ban on the consumption of fish caught in the lake was finally lifted in 1999.Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission (1999). \\"Regulations Committee Meeting\\". Commission meeting transcript.

She is married to heavy metal singer-songwriter Ozzy Osbourne and came to prominence after appearing on The Osbournes (2002‚Äì2005), a reality television show that aired on MTV, which followed her family's daily life. Osbourne later became a talent show judge on television shows, such as The X Factor (2004‚Äì2007, 2013, 2016‚Äì2017) and America's Got Talent (2007‚Äì2012). Osbourne is credited with reviving her husband's heavy metal career by founding the summer Ozzfest tour. She has hosted her own television talk show The Sharon Osbourne Show (2003‚Äì2006). In 2010, Osbourne was a contestant on NBC's The Celebrity Apprentice (2010), in which she finished in third place. Since 2010, she has been a co-host on the CBS talk show The Talk. In 2014 and 2017, Osbourne appeared as an occasional panellist on the ITV talk show Loose Women. Osbourne has also released three autobiography books and one novel. Her first autobiography, Extreme, debuted at number one on the Sunday Times bestseller list, where it remained for 15 weeks and sold over 621,000 copies, becoming the biggest-selling autobiography since British records began.  Early life  Sharon Rachel Levy was born on 9 October 1952 in London, United Kingdom, as the daughter of Don Arden (born Harry Levy, 1926‚Äì2007), who was a music promoter and rock and roll entrepreneur, and his wife, Hope (n√©e Shaw, 1916‚Äì1999). She has a brother, David. She describes herself as of Irish and Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. Osbourne revealed she was surrounded by violence during her childhood and that it was a normal occurrence to see her father threatening someone, or brandishing a firearm. Osbourne's father, Don Arden, was a rock and roll entrepreneur who managed Black Sabbath and fired Ozzy Osbourne from the group. Levy began dating future husband Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 after Black Sabbath fired him and took over his management from the Arden organisation. Levy coordinated the recruitment of a backing band (Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, and Lee Kerslake) for the recording of the Blizzard of Ozz album and helped Ozzy launch what became a successful solo career. Arden resented his daughter for dating Ozzy and managing his career. In her memoir, Osbourne relates that he had robbed her, once tried to kill her, and once told Ozzy that she had tried to seduce him, in an effort to turn Ozzy against her. She soon lost contact with her father and did not speak to him for 20 years. In an interview in 2001, she commented that her father has never seen her children and that \\"he never will\\". Osbourne had told her children that their grandfather was dead, but they unknowingly saw him for the first time when Osbourne was shouting abuse at him on a street in Los Angeles. When asked who she was shouting at, she replied Tony Curtis. They were reunited in 2001 and he then had a role in their reality show, The Osbournes. In August 2004, Osbourne stated her father had Alzheimer's disease and she paid for his care in the last years of his life. Osbourne's relationship with her mother was also damaged. At the age of 17, Osbourne lost her virginity and realized two months later that she was pregnant. By her account, pressure from others, principally her mother, influenced her decision to have an abortion, which Osbourne has described as the biggest mistake in her life. While visiting her parents on a later occasion, her mother's dogs attacked her and it was some time before her mother appeared to call them off. She was pregnant at the time and subsequently lost the baby. According to a 2009 article in The Guardian, Hope Arden was a cold woman who became even stranger after a serious car accident, something which Osbourne said \\"unhinged her\\". When Osbourne was informed of her mother's death, she said \\"Oh, what a shame\\" and simply put the phone down. Sharon and Ozzy, March 2004 Career= Ozzfest = A series of high-selling albums and world tours followed through the 1980s, eventually bringing about Ozzy's popularity. In 1996, Osbourne created the Ozzfest summer touring festival. It went on to become a regular rock occasion and celebrated a 10th anniversary in 2006. By 2007, the ticket prices had reached ¬£76 and Osbourne announced that the tickets would be free to allow more people the opportunity to attend the concert. Prior to the founding of Ozzfest, Osbourne approached Lollapalooza, another rock/pop festival, to request that Ozzy play at that year's festival, only to be rejected and told that Ozzy was \\"uncool\\" and too drugged up. It was then that she decided to launch her own festival. Controversy ensued when she pulled the plug on Iron Maiden's set three times in one performance. She also harassed the singer Bruce Dickinson, and threw eggs at the band. = Sharon Osbourne Management = In light of her success managing her husband, Osbourne branched out into managing other acts by creating Sharon Osbourne Management. The new company, with Osbourne as its sole employee, managed artists such as Gary Moore, Mot√∂rhead, Lita Ford, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Coal Chamber. She co-managed a band called Cube, with Cud guitarist Mike Dunphy. Cube were signed to Polydor Records but had limited success. She has also turned down career guidance requests from Fred Durst, Guns N' Roses, and Courtney Love.  Television career = Early work (2002‚Äì2007) = Osbourne gained celebrity status as one of the stars of MTV's reality show, The Osbournes, which followed her family's daily life and had a national audience. As the person who negotiated with MTV to screen the show, she is often credited with bringing about her husband's emergence from heavy metal icon into mainstream celebrity. The show began airing in early 2002, and when, in July 2002, Osbourne was diagnosed with cancer, she insisted that filming should continue. The final episode of the show aired in the US on 21 March 2005. MTV's British affiliate has been airing the show since 2003. The show brought MTV its highest ratings ever in both America and Britain. The Osbournes' Beverly Hills home (made famous on the show) has since been sold and the Osbournes have taken up residence in another home in Beverly Hills. Her Beverly Hills home was later seen in The X Factor during series two. The show saw that Osbourne was responsible for the livelihood of 12 dogs and employs a dog walker named Cherie. From the mid-1990s until the end of The Osbournes in 2005, she was primarily based in Los Angeles with the rest of her family. Osbourne earned an estimated ¬£11.5 million from The Osbournes. In 2009, she was included in Yahoo!'s Top 10 TV Moms from Six Decades of Television for the time period 2002‚Äì2005. In 2003, Osbourne became the host of her own television talk show, The Sharon Osbourne Show, which was syndicated to various US channels and also shown in the UK on Sky One. The show was meant to be a reflection of her personality and home life, similar to her reality show but with the inclusion of guest interviews and performances. During the episodes, she conducted some of her interviews on a giant bed. However, the ratings were never successful and critics panned her inability to perform the basic tasks required of a talk show host, such as reading cue cards and conducting interviews. The show was cancelled in early 2004 after one season. In 2006, UK TV network ITV commissioned a new chat show, initially to be called Mrs Osbourne Presents, but eventually just named The Sharon Osbourne Show. Osbourne signed a deal with ITV for a reputed ¬£2 million. The show began on Tuesday 29 August 2006, and was scheduled to run for six weeks in the 5 pm weekday timeslot. The premiere episode proved a close competition as the show received 1.9 million viewers with 17% share ‚Äì 400,000 viewers (and 3% share) ahead of Richard & Judy on Channel 4. Her second show attracted 2.1 million viewers. However, ratings appeared to decrease after Channel 4 moved its game show Deal Or No Deal, hosted by Noel Edmonds, into the timeslot, with Osbourne managing 1.2 million viewers compared to Deal Or No Deal's 2.9m. Channel 4's The New Paul O'Grady Show returned on Monday 25 September 2006 with 2.3 million viewers compared to Osbourne's 1.6 million. Osbourne was a judge and mentor on the UK's The X Factor every year, from 2004 through to 2007. In the first series she mentored the 16‚Äì24s and chose Roberta Howett, Cassie Compton and Tabby Callaghan to represent her in the live rounds of the show. The best placed of these was Tabby, who finished third overall. The final was contested between Simon Cowell's act Steve Brookstein and Louis Walsh's act G4, with Steve winning. Osbourne's outburst against Steve on the night of the final is widely credited with helping him to win, although according to her autobiography he was well ahead at all stages of the voting. In the second series she mentored the 25-and-overs, and selected Andy Abraham, Brenda Edwards, Chico Slimani and Maria Lawson to contest the final rounds. Andy Abraham finished in second place to Louis Walsh's act Shayne Ward. During this series, the judges were again required to bring the selected candidates to their homes. Osbourne chose her Beverly Hills home as a suitable location, which saw Osbourne inviting her neighbours and husband Ozzy Osbourne to attend live performances by the candidates. During Chico's performance, he jumped into her functioning fountain with a live microphone, and proceeded to splash water. Osbourne also appeared in the spin-off show The X Factor: Battle of the Stars. She was not required to choose her celebrity singing contestants but was selected to manage the 16‚Äì24s which were made up of Nikki Sanderson, Matt Stevens and Michelle Marsh. In the third series of The X Factor in 2006, she was mentoring the 25-and-overs, and selected Ben Mills, Dionne Mitchell, Robert Allen and Kerry McGregor. Kerry and Dionne were voted out in a double elimination on 28 October, Robert was voted out on 18 November and Ben was voted out on 9 December, sending Osbourne out of the competition. During the filming of the third series, Osbourne lived at the Dorchester Hotel in central London. Osbourne was criticised for her outbursts on the show, where before a live show in series three she reportedly spoke out against Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? presenter Chris Tarrant, who was in the show's audience prior to filming. Tarrant had made a joke about her husband Ozzy to which Osbourne took offence, but most of her outburst focused on criticising Tarrant's recent infidelity to his wife Ingrid from whom he was in the process of separating. It was rumoured that Cowell, fellow judge and creator of the show, was displeased with her performance in series three, and was thinking of replacing her and Walsh for the next series. However, it was confirmed that Osbourne had been contracted to return for the fourth series of the show. She then appeared in the fourth series along with judges Cowell, Walsh and new judge, Dannii Minogue, and mentored the Girls category during the series. During the first live show, aired on 20 October 2007, Osbourne walked out on the panel after learning of two of her own acts, Kimberley Southwick and Alisha Bennett, being in the bottom two. However, on The Paul O'Grady Show, aired on 23 October 2007, Osbourne confirmed she would return on the next episode and stated that it is part of her personality to say things in the heat of the moment and not to contrive anything that she says. Two weeks into the live shows, a number of happy slapping videos of Emily Nakanda, the only other act in Osbourne's category, appeared in the media, apparently showing her beating another teenaged girl. The resulting backlash resulted in Nakanda withdrawing from the show. On 17 November, Bennett was voted out of the competition, leaving Osbourne with no acts halfway through the series. = Later work (2007‚Äìpresent) = Osbourne joined the judging panel on the second season of America's Got Talent, along with Piers Morgan and David Hasselhoff, replacing Brandy Norwood. Osbourne later worked on the show with Howie Mandel and Howard Stern as judges and Nick Cannon as host. The season premiered in the United States on 5 June 2007. In her first episode, Osbourne came into a conflict with Piers Morgan when she felt he judged a child contestant too harshly. She threatened to leave the show in the middle of filming, saying \\"I didn't sign up for this\\", but was talked out of it. The incident was shown on air. Osbourne has since stayed with the show for its third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh seasons. The new season was announced in a promotional video shown during a commercial break for season seven's second live show. Osbourne initially stated that she will not return for the season, but later said that she was staying with the show \\"for now\\". Following this, she announced she was quitting after a dispute with NBC and the producers of Stars Earn Stripes involving what she believed was disability discrimination against her son Jack. On 6 June 2008, it was announced in a statement on behalf of Osbourne that she has decided to step down as an X Factor judge after four series on the show. The statement read \\"Sharon would like to thank the wonderful British public for their enormous support during what's been an exciting ride. She would also like to take this opportunity to thank Simon Cowell and ITV while wishing them all the best for the next series.\\" A spokesman from ITV commented \\"She has been a tremendous judge and mentor on the programme, but we respect her wish to leave and wish her the very best.\\" Osbourne was replaced by Cheryl Cole. During an interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, broadcast on 22 February 2009, Osbourne admitted that the reason for her departure from The X Factor was her fractured relationship with Minogue. She stated \\"I didn't enjoy working with her at all and didn't fancy the prospect of spending six months sitting next to her.\\" Osbourne hosted the second season of Rock of Love: Charm School with co-hosts Riki Rachtman and Daniella Clarke on VH1. Osbourne had a physical altercation on 13 December 2008 with contestant Megan Hauserman on the reunion special for the show after Hauserman made derogatory statements about Osbourne's husband, Ozzy. Hauserman reportedly filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department and has since filed a lawsuit against Osbourne, claiming battery, negligence and infliction of emotional distress. In 2011, Osbourne reached a settlement with Hauserman. In July 2008, Fox announced that the Osbourne family would be hosting a new variety show titled Osbournes: Reloaded (working title was Osbournes: Loud and Dangerous). The show started filming at CBS Studios in Hollywood in December 2008 before a live audience. The show premiered in March 2009. Fremantle Media North America is producing the show. The show was canceled after its premiere episode. In March 2010, Osbourne appeared on NBC's The Celebrity Apprentice, coming in third place. Osbourne co-hosts The Talk, which is a talk show that premiered 18 October 2010. This decision came after CBS canceled the soap opera As the World Turns. The show is similar to The View and seeks to address motherhood and other contemporary issues. Osbourne is the last original co-host following the departure of fellow co-host and series creator Sara Gilbert. In September 2010, Osbourne made a return to The X Factor at the Judges' Houses round of series 7 where she assisted Walsh at Adare Manor, County Limerick, Ireland to pick the final 3 contestants of the Over 28s category, Then in September 2012, she joined Walsh again this time in Las Vegas, for the 9th series Judges' Houses segment of the competition, to help him choose his final 3 groups. Osbourne has expressed interest in reprising her role on the judging panel, notably in September 2012, when she said that she would 'love' to return for the show's tenth series. Media outlets reported in December 2012 that X Factor producers had approached Osbourne for a return in 2013, reportedly to replace Tulisa. In April 2013, the show's creative director Brian Friedman said that he was \\"confident\\" of Sharon Osbourne's return, following her departure from America's Got Talent and replacement by Heidi Klum. It was later announced by ITV that Osbourne would indeed be returning for the tenth series of the show, replacing Tulisa. She returned to the judging panel alongside Gary Barlow, Nicole Scherzinger, and original panellist Walsh. During the live shows, she mentored the Over 25s category which included Lorna Simpson, Shelley Smith and Sam Bailey. Bailey was eventually announced as the winner of the show on 15 December, marking Osbourne's first victory as a mentor in the show's ten-year history. Osbourne did not return for the eleventh series of The X Factor UK and was replaced by Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. In 2014 and 2017, Osbourne appeared as a guest panellist on ITV's daytime programme Loose Women. On 1 June 2016, it was announced that once again, Osbourne would return to The X Factor for the show's thirteenth series to replace Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. She judged alongside Cowell, Walsh (who replaced Nick Grimshaw) and Scherzinger (who replaced Rita Ora). She once again mentored the Over 25s category, choosing Saara Aalto, Relley C and Honey G as her final three contestants. Aalto went on to become the series' runner-up. Although initially casting doubt on returning for another series due to her commitments with The Talk, Osbourne returned to The X Factor for the fourteenth series. This time she again mentored the Girls category; her last act Grace Davies finished as the runner-up. In 2020, she portrayed herself in season 5, episode 2 of Lucifer.  Media appearances  In January 2003, Osbourne and the rest of her family hosted the 30th Annual American Music Awards. The night was marked with constant \\"bleeping\\" due to some of the lewd and raunchy remarks made by both Osbourne and Ozzy. Additionally, the night was met with some controversy, as critics panned their hosting and presenter Patricia Heaton walked out midway in disgust. In January 2005, she was contracted to feature in a television advertising campaign for UK supermarket chain, Asda and later in 2007, Osbourne became the new face of Galabingo when she was featured in television advertisements promoting the gambling website. She has co-hosted one of the Royal Variety Performances with Jonathan Ross. Osbourne appeared in Days of Our Lives, It's a Boy Girl Thing. On Friday 15 June 2007, Osbourne guest hosted The Friday Night Project with Justin Lee Collins and Alan Carr. Osbourne also made a cameo appearance on 23 June 2007 in an episode of the science fiction series Doctor Who. The episode \\"The Sound of Drums\\" saw her appearing in a spoof party political broadcast, which featured testimonials from British celebrities such as Osbourne and the band McFly showing their support for Mr Saxon to become Prime Minister. On 20 February 2008, Sharon Osbourne co-hosted the 28th edition of the BRIT Awards at Earls Court in London, along with her husband and daughter Kelly. During the awards Osbourne caused controversy and sparked complaints by calling Vic Reeves, who was presenting one of the awards, a \\"piss head\\" and a \\"bastard\\" after he appeared to be drunk, although he claimed that he was having trouble reading the autocue. On 22 August 2008, Osbourne took part in the 2008 MediaGuardian Edinburgh International Television Festival in Scotland. In 2009 she co-hosted WWE Raw with her husband Ozzy. On 1 April 2010, Sharon Osbourne (along with Kelly Osbourne) joined Cyndi Lauper in the launch of her Give a Damn campaign to bring a wider awareness of discrimination of the LGBT community as part of her True Colors Fund. The organisation campaigns to urge straight people to stand up with the gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender community and stop discrimination. Other names included in the campaign are Whoopi Goldberg, Jason Mraz, Elton John, Judith Light, Cynthia Nixon, Kim Kardashian & Clay Aiken. Anna Paquin is also part of the campaign and came out as bisexual. This news clogged the Give A Damn website. Osbourne has a recurring voice role as Mama Hook in the animated television series Jake and the Never Land Pirates, which was broadcast in 2012. In 2016, Osbourne appeared in two videos for PETA, explaining why she gave up wearing fur and encouraging others to do the same.\\"Sharon Osbourne Fronting New Anti-fur Campaign,\\" Contactmusic.com, 25 January 2016.  Autobiographies  Sharon Osbourne's first autobiography, Extreme (co-authored by Penelope Dening), was published in October 2005 and tells of her difficult childhood growing up with her father, Don Arden, and also documents the highs and lows of her marriage to husband Ozzy Osbourne, shedding light on areas of her life previously not commented on. Domestic violence, drug abuse, alcoholism, affairs, bribery, colon cancer, robberies, a plane crash, therapy, and cosmetic surgery are also documented in the autobiography. Published by Time WarnerBooks, it went to Number 1 on the Sunday Times Bestseller List (UK) where it remained for 15 weeks and sold over 621,000 copies in hardback, becoming the biggest-selling autobiography since British records began, beating the previous record set by David Beckham's autobiography by 100,000 copies. In March 2006 it won Biography of the Year at the British Book Awards. The autobiography has proceeded to sell in excess of two million copies which has become the most successful female autobiography ever. Osbourne later released another autobiography named Survivor, the title coming from surviving cancer. It was released in 2007. In August 2013, Osbourne announced on Twitter that her third autobiography named Unbreakable, would be released on 10 October 2013.

More than 7,000 votes were cast in a range of categories. * During Osbourne's time battling cancer, she attended an award ceremony to collect a gong for the success of her family's television show The Osbournes. She attended the Creative Arts Emmy Awards in Los Angeles with her daughter Kelly Osbourne, to receive the best reality television show award. * In late 2004, Osbourne attended the Woman of the Year awards in London to collect an award that she had previously won at the 2002 event, but was unable to accept due to illness. * Osbourne was voted Freemans Celebrity Mum of the Year in 2006, fending off competition from Jordan, Kate Moss and the Duchess of Cornwall. * In 2006, Osbourne's autobiography won Biography of the year at the British Book Awards. * There is a wax figure of Osbourne at Madame Tussauds. * She is an honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation. Public image On the Sunday Times Rich List 2006, Osbourne was listed as the 44th richest woman in Britain and the 60th richest woman on the 2007 list. In the overall British list in 2006, Osbourne and her husband appeared together as the 554th richest people with a combined wealth of ¬£100 million. As of 2008, the couple was ranked as the 724th richest people in Britain with an estimated joint wealth of ¬£110 million. Osbourne has sent her son or daughter's feces in Tiffany boxes on more than one occasion to people she felt had unreasonably criticised her or her family. When a journalist criticised her teenage children, Osbourne sent a box of excrement with a note saying, \\"I heard you've got an eating disorder. Eat this.\\" The popular British comedy Dead Ringers, features and spoofs Osbourne (played by Jan Ravens) quite prominently alongside her husband (played by Jon Culshaw). Also, she was spoofed by impressionist Ronni Ancona on Alistair McGowan's Big Impression and was also featured in comedy 2DTV. On Saturday Night Live, Amy Poehler played her on \\"Celebrity Jeopardy!\\" skit on 14 May 2005. Sharon Osbourne appeared in season nine of Celebrity Apprentice. On 16 May 2010, she was fired during the double elimination round. Impressionist Francine Lewis performed an impression of her in the seventh series of Britain's Got Talent. Personal life Sharon Osbourne (then Sharon Levy) met her future husband Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, at the age of 18, while working for her father, Don Arden, who was managing Black Sabbath at the time. When Ozzy was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Sharon started to date him and took over his management as a solo artist. The two were married in Maui, Hawaii, on 4 July 1982. Together, Sharon and Ozzy have three children: Aimee, Kelly and Jack. For years, the Osbourne marriage was plagued by alcohol, drug use, and violence, with Osbourne having even been arrested for driving while intoxicated. The couple used to physically fight regularly and, according to Osbourne, they would \\"beat.\\" She has described herself as \\"a beaten woman\\" when she was at the hands of husband Ozzy where he once knocked out her front teeth. She once retaliated by throwing a full bottle of scotch at his head. The most notorious incident arose in August 1989, when Ozzy was arrested for attempted murder after he had returned from the Moscow Music Peace Festival, and tried to strangle Osbourne in a haze of alcohol and drugs. After the incident, he spent six months in rehabilitation as a result of his actions, after which time, Osbourne said she regained her strength in their relationship and did not press charges. In July 2002, after colon cancer claimed the life of Reagan Erin Marcato, the mother of her daughters' friend, then-18-year-old son Robert, Osbourne told the BBC that she had adopted Robert; however, when he was later sent to live with his father following a nervous breakdown, Osbourne denied having legally adopted him. = Health = In 1999, Osbourne lost after lap-band surgery (adjustable gastric band). Osbourne commented that being large was an essential part of her persona when she worked for her father and that being larger, she made a more dramatic entrance. On 26 October 2006, she went on the Howard Stern Show and revealed that she gained 15 pounds in the last year and would be having her plastic band removed. In July 2002, Osbourne had surgery for cancer. She announced it was colon cancer and had spread to her lymph nodes and was more serious than originally thought. She survived the disease against a 33% survival prognosis. Despite battling cancer, she insisted that the MTV cameras document her illness during the filming of the second season of The Osbournes. When Osbourne's hair fell out during her subsequent treatment, her wigs were custom made by Cher's wigmaker. Ozzy Osbourne admitted that he \\"fell apart\\" during her treatment and recovery, and it was revealed that her son, Jack Osbourne, tried to commit suicide because of his depression stemming from his mother's condition. In August 2004, she founded the Sharon Osbourne Colon Cancer Program at Cedars Sinai Hospital. In addition, she was the honoured guest at the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's 2003 Fall Gala, where she spoke of her struggle against cancer. Osbourne has lent her support to design limited edition T-shirts or vests for the 'Little Tee Campaign' for Breast Cancer Care which donates money for breast cancer research. Osbourne has freely admitted to having extensive cosmetic surgery. As well as documenting this in her autobiography, she appeared on Dr. Phil on 14 December 2006, and commented on everything that had been surgically changed on her body to improve her appearance. She stated that she had had a full rhytidectomy, abdominoplasty, mastopexy, as well as many other procedures, but commented that she would not have any surgery performed on her eyes or lips. She has admitted to spending ¬£300,000 on plastic surgery. In early November 2012, Osbourne revealed she had undergone a double mastectomy after learning she had a gene that increases the risk of developing breast cancer. = Household incidents = In 2004, Osbourne's home in Jordans, Buckinghamshire, was burgled by a man who stole gems worth ¬£2 million. The burglar managed to get away with the gems despite being put in a headlock by Ozzy. Items taken during the burglary included wedding rings, an engagement ring, pearl and diamond necklaces, a large 52 carat (10 g) sapphire ring and two pairs of diamond earrings. After the incident, Osbourne appeared on Crimewatch and offered a reward of ¬£100,000 for the return of her valuable jewellery. In March 2005, there was an incident in the Osbournes' mansion in Jordans, Buckinghamshire. Ozzy and Sharon were forced to flee their mansion when a blaze broke out as they slept. They were not injured but had to be treated for smoke inhalation. In 2006, another fire broke out at the Osbourne's mansion; however, none of the family was at home. = Political statements =Brexit In 2016, Osbourne voted for Brexit in the referendum regarding the issue. She subsequently stated in an interview with the Sunday Times that there had been too much foreign immigration into England, and that its society was being adversely affected by it.'Sharon Osborne is under fire from fans over her Brexit confession'. 'Metro', 28 August 2016. https://metro.co.uk/2016/08/28/sharon-osborne-is-under-fire-over- her-brexit-confession-6095515/ Labour Party In September 2019, in widely reported comments made in an interview with The Sun, Osbourne said of Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, \\"Oh my God, I hate him so much. I want to hurt him; I want to physically hurt this man. He is the most arrogant, ugly fuck. I want to hurt him. Oh my God, he is revolting; so ugly, inside and out. This ugliness oozes from him, he's repulsive.\\" John Wayne Airport Osbourne has shown support for a campaign to rename Orange County‚Äôs John Wayne Airport. She said \\"‚ÄòIt just gives me the creeps. There has always been this reputation of him of really hating blacks, Jews, anybody that wasn‚Äôt white\\". ‚ÄòWhen the airport came, I was like: ‚ÄúWhy would you give this man this honour of having an airport named after somebody like that, who is just a bad man, a really ugly man?‚Äù  Controversies = Iron Maiden = At Iron Maiden's last Ozzfest performance, on 20 August 2005 at the Hyundai Pavilion at Glen Helen in San Bernardino, California, several negative events took place, allegedly the fault of Sharon Osbourne. Osbourne's actions were reportedly in retaliation to lead singer Bruce Dickinson slighting reality TV, with claims that this was an attack on Ozzy Osbourne himself. During the first Iron Maiden song, several members of the front row of the crowd (reportedly a combination of Osbourne's entourage and a few members from other bands persuaded by Osbourne or her entourage) were reported to have bombarded the band with eggs, bottle caps, and ice. Some reports also say that Sharon's daughter, Kelly, was throwing objects at the band. During three of Iron Maiden's songs, the PA system was switched off, cutting power to Dickinson's microphone and the band's instruments. In audio captured during the concert, it is reported that Dickinson can be heard accusing the festival's organisers of deliberately cutting off the band's power. Also unknown to Iron Maiden, played secretly through the PA at the very beginning and end of their set was a tape with the chant \\"Ozzy ‚Äì Ozzy ‚Äì Ozzy\\". On Iron Maiden's departure, Sharon made a few statements on stage in front of the 40,000 people in attendance. She told the audience that while she \\"absolutely loved Iron Maiden,\\" she thought lead singer Bruce Dickinson was a \\"prick\\" and had \\"disrespected Ozzfest since they began their stint with the tour.\\" Her words were met with booing, and soon afterwards she walked off the stage. Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smallwood, issued a statement shortly after the debacle condemning the attack on the band as \\"vile, dangerous, criminal and cowardly\\" as well as disrespectful to fans who had paid to see the band perform \\"a full unhindered performance.\\". Dickinson later denied making a personal attack on Ozzy Osbourne; \\"Did I have a go at Ozzy and Black Sabbath? No. Why would I? But I do find The Osbournes TV series loathsome, and the whole cult of reality TV celebrities disgusting.\\" = The Smashing Pumpkins = In 2000, Osbourne resigned from managing The Smashing Pumpkins by releasing a memo which said, \\"It was with great pride and enthusiasm that I took on management of the Pumpkins back in October, but unfortunately I must resign today due to medical reasons ... [The Smashing Pumpkins frontman] Billy Corgan was making me sick!!!\\" In an October 2008 interview, Osbourne revealed that she and Corgan had recently made up: \\"I saw him at the Scream Awards. We hadn't seen each other since that whole thing in Germany. The first time we ran into each other and we hugged and kissed and laughed.\\" = The Talk = In July 2011, Osbourne and some of her fellow The Talk panelists were criticised for their conduct when discussing the story of Catherine Kieu. Osbourne described Kieu's cutting off of her husband's penis and putting it in a garbage disposal as \\"quite fabulous\\", Osbourne also laughed about the incident with her fellow panellists and members of the audience. Osbourne's cohost Sara Gilbert offered the counterpoint \\"Not to be a total buzz kill, but it is a little bit sexist. If somebody cut a woman's breast off, nobody would be sitting laughing.\\", Osbourne replied by saying \\"It's different\\". Osbourne later apologised for her behaviour, stating \\"she was sorry she offended people\\" and that she \\"did not condone genital mutilation\\". Osbourne's co-hosts on The Talk, Leah Remini and Holly Robinson Peete were released from their contracts in 2011. Osbourne spoke of their dismissals in December 2011 on The Howard Stern Show, stating: \\"Some people don't really know who they are, and you have to know who you are when you're in something like this. You can't pretend to be something you're not. You have to know your brand. You can't be all things to everyone.\\" Remini later protested her dismissal and leveled accusations aimed at Osbourne through a series of tweets. = Fired assistant revelation = In 2019, Osbourne appeared on the British panel show Would I Lie to You? in which guests make statements about themselves and fellow panelists decide whether it is true or a lie. She claimed that during a house fire she made her assistant go back into the house to save pieces of art. She also claimed that she ripped an oxygen mask off the assistant and gave it to her dog. She then proceeded to fire him when he did not find the situation funny, believing he might have lung damage from smoke inhalation, saying ‚Äúhe showed absolutely no sense of humour‚Äù during the fire. After the usual deliberations by fellow panelists, she confirmed the incident to be true. The clip of Sharon's story on the show that was uploaded by the official BBC YouTube Channel was met with an overwhelmingly negative reception. There was also a considerable backlash from Twitter users.

It forms the outermost layer of the nerve fiber in the peripheral nervous system. The neurilemma is underlain by the myelin sheath (also known as the medullary sheath). In the central nervous system, axons are myelinated by oligodendrocytes, thus lack neurilemma. The myelin sheaths of oligodendrocytes do not have neurilemma because excess cytoplasm is directed centrally toward the oligodendrocyte cell body. Neurilemma serves a protective function for peripheral nerve fibers. Damaged nerve fibers may regenerate if the cell body is not damaged and the neurilemma remains intact.

As these are Sundays anyway, they have been left away by the other states, nor counted in the table above (the state of Hesse even declared all Sundays public holidays). Quiet days A couple of days are designated stille Tage (quiet days) by state legislation, which regularly means that public dancing events, music at inns (if live or if not much quieter than usual) etc. are prohibited. Some public holidays are quiet days: * Good Friday * Prayer and Repentance Day (where it is a public holiday and in a couple of other states) * All Saints (where it is a public holiday) One de facto public holiday (not determined by law, because it is always on a Sunday, but with officially organized celebrations) is a quiet day: * Memorial Day (33rd Sunday of Ordinary Time) One other Sunday is a quiet day: * Totensonntag (the German-Protestant equivalent of All Souls Day), on the last Sunday of the ecclesiastical year Some days may be quiet days without being public holidays: * Christmas Eve (beginning in the afternoon, in some states) * Ash Wednesday (in Bavaria) * Holy Thursday (in some states; in some of them beginning in the evening) * Holy Saturday (in some states) * All Souls' Day (in Lower Saxony and the Saarland) In a limited number of cases ‚Äì apart from All Saints which, however, has long been associated in popular understanding with remembrance of the dead. The status of quiet days is also given to festivities joyous in nature: in Hesse, the highest Christian holidays are half-quiet days (until midday) and in Rhineland-Palatinate, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day are two-thirds-quiet days (until 16 o'clock). For details see the German article on the dancing ban.  Flag days  A yet third category that may, sometimes, be called \\"holidays\\" in a sense are the \\"flag days\\" (Beflaggungstage). Only the very highest institutions, and the military, use the national flags at every day, so the directives when flags are to be displayed mark the days in question as special. Flags are to be shown by Federal Decree on * Holocaust Memorial Day (27 January, half-mast) * Labour Day (1 May) * Europe Day (9 May) * Constitution Day (23 May) * Remembrance of 17 June. This day was public holiday under the title of \\"German Unity Day\\" from 1954 until 1990 that unity actually was achieved. * World Refugee Day (20 June) * Remembrance of 20 July * German Unity Day (3 October) * Memorial Day (half-mast) (two Sundays before the first day of Advent) * Election Day (Bundestag, European Parliament) and by state decrees on other days, such as election days for state parliaments, state constitution days, anniversary of the election of the Federal President (in Berlin) and so forth. Frequently flags are ordered ad hoc to be shown at half-mast in cases of national mourning.  Unofficial holidays  Either Carnival Monday (\\"Rosenmontag\\") or Mardi Gras is a de facto holiday in some towns and cities in Catholic western and southern Germany which have a strong Carnival tradition. Also, Christmas- Eve is developing into a sort of semi-holiday: from the middle of the afternoon, it is practically treated as a holiday, and while in the morning shops are still open, working for other businesses (apart from those that work even on holidays) is becoming more and more unusual; schools are closed in any case. Customs about holidays Ascension Day (Christi Himmelfahrt) and Corpus Christi (Fronleichnam) are both always on Thursdays. By taking only one day's leave, employees can have a four-day weekend.

Fuxi was counted as the first of the Three Sovereigns at the beginning of the Chinese dynastic period. Origin Pangu was said to be the creation god in Chinese mythology. He was a giant sleeping within an egg of chaos. As he awoke, he stood up and divided the sky and the earth. Pangu then died after standing up, and his body turned into rivers, mountains, plants, animals, and everything else in the world, among which is a powerful being known as Huaxu. Huaxu gave birth to a twin brother and sister, Fuxi and N√ºwa. Fuxi and N√ºwa are said to be creatures that have faces of human and bodies of snakes. Fuxi was known as the \\"original human\\", and he was said to have been born in the lower-middle reaches of the Yellow River in a place called Chengji (possibly modern Lantian, Shaanxi province, or Tianshui, Gansu province). In reality, many Chinese people believe that Huaxu (Fuxi's mother) was a leader during the matriarchal society (BC) as early Chinese developed language skill while Fuxi and N√ºwa were leaders in the early patriarchal society (BCE) while Chinese began the marriage rituals. Creation legend According to the Classic of Mountains and Seas, Fuxi and N√ºwa were the original humans who lived on the mythological Kunlun Mountain (today's Huashan). One day they set up two separated piles of fire, and the fire eventually became one. Under the fire, they decided to become husband and wife. Fuxi and N√ºwa used clay to create offspring, and with the divine power they made the clay figures come alive. These clay figures were the earliest human beings. Fuxi and N√ºwa were usually recognized by Chinese as two of the Three Sovereigns in the early patriarchal society in China (BCE), based on the myth about Fuxi establishing marriage ritual in his tribe. The creation of human beings was a symbolic story of having a larger family structure that included the figure of a father. Social importance On one of the columns of the Fuxi Temple in Gansu Province, the following couplet describes Fuxi's importance: \\"Among the three primogenitors of Huaxia civilization, Fu Xi in Huaiyang Country ranks first.\\" During the time of his predecessor N√ºwa, society was matriarchal. Fuxi taught his subjects to cook, to fish with nets, and to hunt with weapons made of bone, wood, or bamboo. He instituted marriage and offered the first open-air sacrifices to heaven. A stone tablet, dated AD 160, shows Fuxi with N√ºwa. Traditionally, Fuxi is considered the originator of the I Ching, which work is attributed to his reading of the He Map (or the Yellow River Map). According to this tradition, Fuxi had the arrangement of the trigrams of the I Ching revealed to him in the markings on the back of a mythical dragon horse (sometimes said to be a tortoise) that emerged from the Luo River. This arrangement precedes the compilation of the I Ching during the Zhou dynasty. This discovery is said to have been the origin of calligraphy. Fuxi is also credited with the invention of the Guqin musical instrument, though credit for this is also given to Shennong and Yellow Emperor. The Figurists viewed Fuxi as Enoch, the Biblical patriarch.

In 2017, the monument's size was reduced by a succeeding presidential proclamation. The land is among the most remote in the country; it was the last to be mapped in the contiguous United States.\\"Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante National Monument\\". blm.gov. Bureau of Land Management. 2017. Retrieved December 10, 2017. There are three main regions: the Grand Staircase, the Kaiparowits Plateau, and the Canyons of the Escalante (Escalante River). All regions are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as part of the National Conservation Lands system. President Bill Clinton designated the area as a national monument in 1996 using his authority under the Antiquities Act. Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante is the largest national monument managed by the BLM. On December 4, 2017, President Donald Trump ordered that the monument's size be reduced by nearly 47% to , with the remainder divided into three areas, two of which border one another along the Paria River. Conservation, angling, hunting, and outdoor recreation groups have filed suit to block any reduction in the national monument, arguing that the president has no legal authority to materially shrink a national monument.Environmental, conservation groups sue Trump over monument changes. CNN, 4 December 2017 Management The monument is managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) rather than the National Park Service. This was the first U.S. national monument managed by the BLM. Visitor centers are located in Cannonville, Big Water, Escalante, and Kanab. Geography The monument stretches from the towns of Big Water, Glendale, and Kanab, Utah in the southwest, to the towns of Escalante and Boulder in the northeast. Originally encompassing , the monument was slightly larger in area than the state of Delaware. After a reduction ordered by presidential proclamation in December 2017, the monument now encompasses . Willis Creek in the Grand Staircase The western part of the monument is dominated by the Paunsaugunt Plateau and the Paria River, and is adjacent to Bryce Canyon National Park. This section shows the geologic progression of the Grand Staircase. Features include the slot canyons of Bull Valley Gorge, Willis Creek, and Lick Wash which are accessed from Skutumpah Road. The center section is dominated by a single long ridge, called the Kaiparowits Plateau from the west, and Fifty-Mile Mountain when viewed from the east. Fifty-Mile Mountain stretches southeast from the town of Escalante to the Colorado River in Glen Canyon. The eastern face of the mountain is a escarpment. The western side (the Kaiparowits Plateau) is a shallow slope descending to the south and west. East of Fifty-Mile Mountain are the Canyons of the Escalante. The monument is bounded by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area on the east and south. The popular hiking, backpacking and canyoneering areas include Calf Creek Falls off Utah Scenic Byway 12, and Zebra Canyon, Harris Wash, and the Devils Garden. The latter areas are accessed via the Hole-in-the-Rock Road which extends southeast from Escalante, near the base of Fifty-Mile Mountain. The Dry Fork Slots of Coyote Gulch and lower Coyote Gulch are also located off the Hole-in-the-Rock Road; however, since December 2017, they are no longer within monument boundaries (see map). Paleontology Utahceratops gettyi Since 2000, numerous dinosaur fossils over 75 million years old have been found at Grand Staircase‚ÄìEscalante. In 2002, a volunteer at the monument discovered a 75-million-year-old dinosaur near the Arizona border. On October 3, 2007, the dinosaur's name, Gryposaurus monumentensis (hook-beaked lizard from the monument) was announced in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. G. monumentensis was at least long and tall, and has a powerful jaw with more than 800 teeth. Many of the specimens from the Kaiparowits Formation are reposited at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City. Two ceratopsid (horned) dinosaurs, also discovered at the monument, were introduced by the Utah Geological Survey in 2007. They were uncovered in the Wahweap formation, which is just below the Kaiparowits formation where the duckbill was extracted. They lived about 80 million or 81 million years ago. The two fossils are called the Last Chance skull and the Nipple Butte skull. They were found in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Both were later identified as belonging to Diabloceratops. In 2013 the discovery of a new species, Lythronax argestes, was announced. It is a tyrannosaur that is approximately 13 million years older than Tyrannosaurus, named for its great resemblance to its descendant. The specimen can be seen at the Natural History Museum of Utah. Human history Anthropomorphic petroglyph along the Escalante River Humans did not settle permanently in the area until the Basketmaker III Era, somewhere around AD 500.Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. Kane County Utah Office of Tourism and Film Commission. Retrieved 2011-10-14. Both the Fremont and ancestral Puebloan people lived here; the Fremont hunting and gathering below the plateau and near the Escalante Valley, and the ancestral Puebloans farming in the canyons. Both groups grew corn, beans, and squash, and built brush-roofed pithouses and took advantage of natural rock shelters. Ruins and rock art can be found throughout the monument. The first record of white settlers in the region dates from 1866, when Captain James Andrus led a group of cavalry to the headwaters of the Escalante River. In 1871 Jacob Hamblin of Kanab, on his way to resupply the second John Wesley Powell expedition, mistook the Escalante River for the Dirty Devil River and became the first Anglo to travel the length of the canyon. In 1879 the San Juan Expedition crossed through the monument on their way to a proposed Mormon colony in the far southeastern corner of Utah. Traveling on a largely unexplored route, the group eventually arrived at the 1200-foot (400 m) sandstone cliffs that surrounded Glen Canyon. They found the only breach for many miles in the otherwise vertical cliffs, which they named Hole-in-the- Rock. The narrow, steep, and rocky crevice eventually led to a steep sandy slope in the lower section and eventually down to the Colorado River. With winter settling in, the company decided to go down the crevice, rather than retreat. After six weeks of labor, including excavation and the use of explosives to shift rock, they rigged a pulley system to lower their wagons and animals down the resulting road and off the cliff. There they built a ferry, crossed the river and climbed back out through Cottonwood Canyon on the other side. Controversy Metate Arch in Devils Garden The national monument was declared on September 18, 1996 at the height of the 1996 presidential election campaign by President Bill Clinton, and was controversial from the moment of creation. The declaration ceremony was held at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona, rather than in Utah. Local officials such as Democratic U.S. Representative Bill Orton from Utah objected to the designation of the national monument, questioning whether the Antiquities Act allowed such vast amounts of land to be designated. However, United States Supreme Court decisions have long established the president's discretion to protect land under the Antiquities Act, and several lawsuits filed in an effort to overturn the designation were dismissed by federal courts.Utah Ass'n of Counties v. George W. Bush, District Court, D. Utah, 2004.The Monumental Legacy of the Antiquites Act of 1906, Mark Squillace, Georgia Law Review, 2003. Monument designation also nixed the Andalex Coal Mine that was proposed for a remote location on the Kaiparowits Plateau. Wilderness designation for the lands in the monument had long been sought by environmental groups; however, designation of the monument is not the same as wilderness designation, as activities such as motorized vehicle and mountain bike use are allowed. There are contentious issues peculiar to the state of Utah. Certain plots of land were assigned when Utah became a state (in 1896) as School and Institutional Trust Lands (SITLa, a Utah state agency), to be managed to produce funds for the state school system. These lands included scattered plots in the monument that could no longer be developed. The SITLa plots within the monument were exchanged for federal lands elsewhere in Utah, plus equivalent mineral rights and $50 million cash by an act of Congress, the Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998, supported by Democrats and Republicans, and signed into law as Public Law 105-335 on October 31, 1998. A more difficult problem is the resolution of United States Revised statute 2477 (R.S. 2477) road claims. R.S. 2477 (Section 8 of the 1866 Mining Act) states: \\"The right-of-way for the construction of highways over public lands, not reserved for public uses, is hereby granted.\\" The statute was repealed by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, but the repeal was subject to valid existing rights. A process for resolving disputed claims has not been established, and in 1996, the 104th United States Congress passed a law which prohibited the R.S. 2477 (proposed resolution regulations) written by the Clinton Administration from taking effect without congressional approval. The right to maintain and improve the many unpaved roads in the national monument is disputed, with county officials placing county road signs on the roads they claim and occasionally applying bulldozers to grade claimed roads, while the BLM tries to exert control over the same roads. Litigation between the state and federal government over R.S. 2477 and road maintenance in the national monument is an ongoing issue.

It is named after its benefactor, Andrew Jackson Zilker, who donated the land to the city in 1917. The land was developed into a park during the Great Depression in the 1930s. Today the park serves as a hub for many recreational activities and the hike and bike trail around Lady Bird Lake, both of which run next to the park. The large size of the park makes it a capable venue for large-scale events such as the Austin City Limits Music Festival and the Zilker Park Kite Festival. The park was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. History The land surrounding Barton Springs was claimed by its namesake, William Barton, in the 1830s for his cattle ranch. In the 1860s it was acquired by the Rabb family, who operated mills on Barton Creek. In the early twentieth century Andrew Jackson Zilker bought a plot of land between the Colorado River and Barton Creek, including the Springs, and used the spring water in his ice-making business. Zilker sold his land to the City of Austin in a series of sales in 1917, 1923 and 1931; he donated the proceeds of the sale to a trust dedicated to funding Austin's public schools. In the 1930s the city transformed the ranch into a space for public recreation, building park amenities and buildings with help from the Civil Works Administration. Barton Springs Pool was given a concrete dam and an enlarged swimming area. In 1934 the park was named Zilker Metropolitan Park, after its donor and patron. Attractions In addition to general-purpose lawns, sports fields, cross country courses, historical markers, concession stands and picnic areas, the park includes numerous public attractions. The Zilker Botanical Garden features several independently maintained gardens located near the center of the park and hosts the Zilker Gardens Festival every spring. The Austin Nature & Science Center offers ecological exhibits, nature hike trails, and children's educational programming. The Umlauf Sculpture Garden adjoins the southeast end of the park, displaying sculptural works by artist Charles Umlauf and others. The Zilker Hillside Theater hosts regular performances by local theatre companies, including free \\"Shakespeare in the Park\\" every May and an annual summer musical. Barton Springs Pool adjoins the park on the east, offering public swimming; other water activities are available in Barton Creek. The Beverly S. Sheffield Education Center by Barton Springs Pool offers exhibits about the natural history of the Edwards Aquifer that feeds Barton Springs. Every winter the Zilker Holiday Tree is illuminated, along with a Trail of Lights display. The Zilker Zephyr gauge miniature railway carries passengers on a tour around the park. The park's amenities and wide open spaces allow it to host a variety of large events each year. Most notably, the Austin City Limits Music Festival fills the park for two weekends each fall with numerous live musical performances by prominent artists.

A Field Guide to 101 of the Most Odd, Extreme, and Outrageous American Subcultures, Adams Media, 2010, , p. 108 Origins= Etymology = The term electronic body music was coined by Ralf H√ºtter of the German electronic band Kraftwerk in November 1977,http://www.djfood.org/kraftwerk-and-the-cold-wave-in-sounds-26-11-77/ and later again in 1978 to explain the more physical sound of their album The Man- Machine.(2007-11-25) Klein, MJ WSKU Radio (Kent - Ohio) - Ralf H√ºtter - 19/06/1978 kraftwerk.technopop.com.br (retrieved on 2008-01-28) \\"Body Music\\" had been used in 1972 by Robert Christgau to describe the amplified beat and art rock component of hard rock bands such as Led Zeppelin, Mott the Hoople, Black Sabbath, and Slade: \\"Bands like Led Zep... make body music of an oddly cerebral cast, arousing aggression rather than sexuality.\\" In 1980/1981, DAF from Germany used the term \\"K√∂rpermusik\\" (body music) to describe their danceable electronic punk sound. The term was later used by Belgian band Front 242 in 1984https://www.discogs.com/Front-242-No-Comment/release/102862 to describe the music of their EP of that year called No Comment,(2004-06-20) Monsoon, Jon EBM - A revolution in progress iAfrica.com (retrieved on 2007-08-03)Ernie Rideout, interview with Front 242, Keyboard Presents the Best of the '80s, Backbeat, 2008, p. 57. using it alongside their preferred description \\"Electro Disco Terrorist Music.\\" =Precursors= The EBM sound was derived from a combination of post-punk sources, including: the industrial music of Cabaret Voltaire and Throbbing Gristle; the synthesizer-based tracks of New Order and Killing Joke; the work of DAF and Kraftwerk; and the Eurodisco dance sound pioneered by Giorgio Moroder. Daniel Bressanutti of Front 242, who helped coin the term EBM to describe their music, named the synthesizer music of Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze as additional influences along Kraftwerk, Throbbing Gristle's Chris Carter, the \\"extended rhythmic disco of [Giorgio] Moroder,\\" and the punk scene. History=1981‚Äì1987= Emerging in the early 1980s, the genre draws heavily on the music of bands such as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire, DAF, Die Krupps,Release Magazine: Die Krupps - Too Much History Liaisons Dangereuses, Portion Control, danceable electropop of Kraftwerk, the \\"extended rhythmic disco of [Giorgio] Moroder,\\" and krautrock.Hillegonda C Rietveld (1998) This Is Our House: House Music, Cultural Spaces and Technologies Aldershot: Ashgate. Archetypes of the genre are tracks \\"Verschwende Deine Jugend\\" and \\"Der Mussolini\\" by Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, \\"Wahre Arbeit, Wahrer Lohn\\" and \\"F√ºr einen Augenblick\\" by Die Krupps, \\"Etre assis ou danser\\" and \\"El Macho y la Nena\\" by Liaisons Dangereuses, and Body to Body and U-Men by Front 242. Front 242 characterized their approach as somewhere between Throbbing Gristle and Kraftwerk. Nitzer Ebb and Skinny Puppy, both influenced by DAF and Cabaret Voltaire, followed soon after. Groups from this era often applied socialist realist aesthetics, with ironic intent. Other prominent artists include Vomito Negro, Borghesia, The Neon Judgement, √†;GRUMH..., A Split- Second, and The Invincible Spirit.\\"The Invincible Spirit\\". Retrieved 15 December 2014. =1988‚Äì1993= In the second half of the 1980s, the genre became popular in Canada (Front Line Assembly) and the U.S. (Ministry,\\"...this album probably owes more to Front 242 than anything.\\" Revolting Cocks, Schnitt Acht) as well as in Sweden (Inside Treatment, Poupp√©e Fabrikk, Cat Rapes Dog) and Japan (2nd Communication, DRP). North American bands started to use typical European EBM elements and combined them with the roughness of (hardcore) punk and thrash metal (cf. industrial metal). Nine Inch Nails continued the cross-pollination between EBM and rock music resulting in the album Pretty Hate Machine (1989). Meanwhile, EBM became popular in the underground club scene, particularly in Europe. In this period the most important labels were the Belgian Play It Again Sam and Antler-Subway, the German Zoth Ommog, the North American Wax Trax! and the Swedish Energy Rekords. At the time, significant artists included And One, Armageddon Dildos, Bigod 20, Insekt,Insekt. Retrieved 15 December 2014. Scapa Flow, Orange Sector, Attrition, and Oil In The Eye. Between the early and the mid-1990s, many EBM artists split up, or changed their musical style, borrowing more distorted \\"industrial\\" elements or elements of rock or metal. The album Tyranny For You by EBM pioneers Front 242 initiated the end of the EBM epoch of the 1980s. Nitzer Ebb, one of the most important artists, became an alternative rock band. Without the strength of its figureheads, the original electronic body music faded by the mid-1990s. =Revival= In the late 1990s and after the millennium, Belgian, Swedish and German groups such as Ionic Vision, Tyske Ludder, and SpetsnazVorndran, Daniela: Spetsnaz, Reflections of Darkness: A Dark Music webzine, March 6, 2006. had reactivated the style. In the same time period, a number of artists from the European techno scene started including more elements of EBM in their sound. This tendency grew in parallel with the emerging electroclash scene and, as that scene started to decline, a number of artists associated with it, such as The Hacker, DJ Hell, Green Velvet, and Black Strobe, moved towards this techno/EBM crossover style. There has been increasing convergence between this scene and the old school EBM scene. Bands and artists have remixed each other. Most notably, Terence Fixmer joined with Nitzer Ebb's Douglas McCarthy to form Fixmer/McCarthy. Subculture Industrial music sub-genres including power electronics follow the transgressive approach of industrial music (e.g. \\"demystification of symbols\\"Bennett A, Guerra P (2018). DIY Cultures and Underground Music Scenes, Routledge, . Quote: \\"[T]he dark symbolism of industrial music, the typically crude appearance associated with the punk era and, above all, underground collages and drawings oriented towards alternative contemporary art. While very particular aesthetic principles may be shared in some extreme subgenres such as power electronics or old-school noise, following the path of industrial music and its demystification of symbols (Obodda, 2002), the aesthetic judgements embraced by labels and listeners often demonstrate the rejection of imagery that is considered unoriginal.\\") and the use of provocative extreme imagery is common (e.g. Nazi paraphernaliaKingsepp, Eva (2011). \\"Nazi Symbolism in Black Metal/National Socialist Black Metal,\\" Stockholm University, Faculty of Humanities, Department of Journalism, Media and Communication (JMK).

Putnam (2013, McFarland). Appropriating far-left and far-right totalitarian, Fascist references, symbols, and signifiers has been a recurring topic of debate between fans and outsiders to the genre alike due to its stylistical ambiguity that stems from industrial music's contrarian nature.. Principal quote: \\"Regarding the emergence of the dance-driven EBM from the industrial scene, a;GRUMPH...'s Jacques Meurrens says, \\"In [1985], the people who liked industrial and the people who liked EBM were mostly the same crowd,\\" but even by the time, audiences were starting to form subgenre-based expectations.\\" In one instance, military-themed band Laibach \\"ma[de] no attempt to subvert this image [so] it has the aura of authenticity\\" so \\"[m]any Laibach fans began to revel in the evils of the band and to take their stage act at face value.\\" Within the larger gothic scene continuum, the so-called \\"dark society,\\" with festivals all over the United States and the United Kingdom, fashion includes the wave style (wide clothes, spiky shoes, Mohawk-style hair, approaching a military look), medieval/romantic style (Victorian and Edwardian fashion- inspired), the \\"common\\" style (black clothes), and the fetish style (latex, sexually provocative, sometimes incorporating a sexualized Nazi aesthetic). Highlighting contrast with makeup; wearing a white face with black eyeliner, lipstick, and nail polish is common. Compared to more feminine-leaning androgynous Gothic styles, classic military style has a \\"part-human part- machine\\" gestalt typical of transhumanist or cyberpunk movements. EBM asserts a hyper-masculine image of \\"triumphalism, combat postures, and paranoia,\\" and is known for its \\"tough-guy\\" or machismo attitudes displayed by both men and women.Martina O, Ernst W (2008). Performativit√§t und Performance: Geschlecht in Musik, Theater und MedienKunst, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, p. 124, . According to Gabi Delgado-L√≥pez of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft, the duo who adopted an aesthetic of black leather and military paraphernalia in the early 1980s was inspired by the male homosexual sado-masochistic scene and is not meant to represent \\"machismo ideology\\" but part of a \\"role.\\"  Derivatives and alternative terms =Electro-industrial= Electro-industrial is an outgrowth of the EBM and industrial music that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound, incorporating elements of ambient industrial. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front 242 and Front Line Assembly. In the early '90s, the style spawned the dark electro genre, and in the end of the decade a strongly techno- and hard-trance-inspired style called \\"hellektro\\" or \\"aggrotech\\". =Industrial dance= Industrial dance is a North American alternative term for electronic body music, which is also used for electro-industrial music as well. Fans associated with this music scene call themselves rivetheads. In general, \\"industrial dance\\" is characterized by its \\"electronic beats, symphonic keyboard lines, pile-driver rhythms, angst-ridden or sampled vocals, and cyberpunk imagery\\". Since the mid-1980s, the term \\"industrial dance\\" has been used to describe the music of Cabaret Voltaire (early 1980s),Holly George-Warren / Patricia Romanowski / Jon Pareles: The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 140, Fireside, 2001, early Die Krupps,David Nobahkt: Suicide: No Compromise, p. 166, SAF Publishing Ltd., 2004, Portion Control,The Wire, Volume 269-274, p. 32, C.

Reiser supported squatting in the early 1970s and later the green political party Die Gr√ºnen. After the German reunification, he joined the Party of Democratic Socialism.  Life  His father was an engineer for Siemens AG, and the family moved several times because of his father's work; they lived in West Berlin, Upper Bavaria, Nuremberg, Mannheim, and Fellbach. Reiser was never really able to feel at home in any of these places. Many of his friends said, when they were asked in an interview which was broadcast on the TV channel arte in 1998, 2 years after his death, that he started playing music to create a place where he felt at home. Reiser was known by his friends as someone who had a very special mind of his own. For example, he managed to persuade his mother Erika M√∂bius that he was allowed to stop attending school and start an apprenticeship in a studio for photography, which he then quit in order to join a music conservatory and later to follow his two older brothers to West Berlin at the early age of 17 in order to put the world's first \\"Rock Opera\\" onto stage. His mother supported his musical and artistic ambitions since she had soon realized that he was an autodidact; he never learned things when he was taught by someone else. Thus he taught himself how to play cello, guitar, the piano and other instruments, wrote lyrics and poetry and later also assumed jobs as actor in some movies and TV shows or at the theatre. He was awarded his nickname Rio as teenager from an eccentric artist friend of the family who invented the name \\"Rio de Galaxis\\" for him in an \\"intergalactic youth ordination\\". He kept the nickname and later decided to completely change his name from Ralph M√∂bius to Rio Reiser because he played a leading role in the movie \\"Johnny West\\" and needed a catchy artist name. He took the idea for the name Reiser from his older brother Gert who had occasionally used it as artist name before. The name makes reference to the main character of the autobiographical novel ' by Karl Philipp Moritz. As an adult, Rio soon discovered his musical talents which opened a way for him to express himself, thus enabling him to overcome restraints he otherwise felt due to a certain, intrinsic insecurity or shyness towards other people. The ability to reach out to others‚Äîeven to the unknown masses in a concert audience‚Äîthrough his musical performance was later often referred to as being the core of his special talent to touch his listeners, or even to \\"build a relationship\\" with each of them for the period of a concert. During his teenage years, Rio Reiser first discovered‚Äîand immediately became a big fan of‚ÄîThe Beatles at age 13 who represented the sound‚Äîand way of life‚Äîof the future for him and also inspired him to learn to play guitar, to compose his own songs and to form his first band. Later he preferred the rough, direct sound of The Rolling Stones. In reference to John Lennon and Paul McCartney, who were usually credited as \\"Lennon/McCartney\\" with respect of the songs they wrote, Rio and his band colleague and best friend R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz) as composers of most of the Ton Steine Scherben-songs were often credited as \\"M√∂bius/Steitz\\". Besides contemporary rock bands which became the soundtrack of the social changes beginning in the Sixties, Rio Reiser was also influenced by other music styles including orchestral film soundtracks, German \\"folk songs\\" and traditional music and German singers such as Marlene Dietrich. Reiser was unique among German rock stars of his time in being openly gay, although he didn't come out publicly until the 1980s. At the beginning of his career, Reiser sometimes felt misfit among the political groups and various movements which, in the early Seventies, did not strongly approve of homosexuality, but later gained more confidence while working with artists who were engaged in the newly forming gay movement of Berlin, including the gay performance group \\"Br√ºhwarm\\" which recorded two LPs with music composed by Ton Steine Scherben.  Musical career  While he still went to school, Reiser became singer in his first rock band The Beat Kings. The band had been founded by R.P.S. Lanrue (real name Ralph Peter Steitz), a boy living in the neighbourhood, who had heard of Reiser's singing talents and had asked him to join the band after letting Reiser perform a few songs to give a sample (as R.P.S. Lanrue later claimed in an interview, the Rolling Stones song \\"Play with fire\\" tipped the balance). Lanrue, who was of the same age as Reiser, soon became Reiser's closest friend and musical counterpart who went on to support Reiser as musician and lived with him most of the time until his death. After having quit school, Reiser left his then hometown, as well as The Beat Kings, to follow his two older brothers' call to Berlin in order to compose the music for their common project, the first Beat-Opera, which turned out to be, in the words of Rio, an \\"absolute flop\\". Nevertheless, Reiser stayed in Berlin, where he was later joined by Lanrue. After occasionally having toured the countryside with the theatre group \\"Hoffmans Comic Theater\\" (consisting in Reiser, his brothers and a group of friends), Reiser went on to continue theatrical projects in Berlin where he joined an improvisation theatre group which played scenes from the everyday life of pupils and trainees, thus adopting and reflecting the social problems among young people in West Berlin in the Sixties, as well as its tense and sense of imminent social change. The theatre was very successful with young people and toured through Germany until 1969. The involvement in the context of the student and youth movement‚Äînot only as musician and actor, but often in the political debates which were to follow the theatre performance as well, played an important role for Rio Reiser's development of political awareness and for his lifelong commitment‚Äîboth privately and as musician‚Äîto liberation movements of various kinds, including, in particular, the left-wing political movement characteristic for the Sixties and Seventies (while he liked to put an emphasis on supporting the workers' and \\"simple people's\\" interests rather than the students' intellectual approach), the Gay liberation movement and later, the German ecological movement. His musical work to a large extent reflects these political influences and convictions and thus can hardly be detached from his political positions. In 1970, Reiser recorded his first single with the band Ton Steine Scherben. The band name was chosen in a lengthy democratic decision procedure among the members, friends and supporters of the band. The original name idea was actually \\"VEB Ton Steine Scherben\\", but the \\"VEB\\" was soon dropped. The band name can be translated both as \\"clay stones shards\\" and as \\"sound stones shards\\", thus offering different approaches to interpretation (sometimes also understood as a political program) and, last not least, making reference to Reiser's favorites The Rolling Stones. In that same year the group performed their first public concert and recorded their first full-length record. The band soon became very popular with the squatter scene, left-wing student and workers' movement and was invited to numerous political events to provide the soundtrack to demonstrations, parties and rallies across Germany which often inspired the audience to translate the message into action afterwards. Thus, many buildings were seized after the end of a concert, and the band often ended up sitting in some commune discussing the political agenda with their hosts. Reiser later revealed in his autobiography that he sometimes would have preferred to just get away with some nice person. This farmhouse in Fresenhagen became Reiser's residence in 1975. 15 years of touring, four more LPs and various film projects and collaborations with other musicians followed, including the recording of two children's records. Reiser lived together with the band and a large group of friends and supporters most of that time, first sharing a commune in Berlin. In 1975‚Äîafter the band was tiring of the numerous demands and expectations by all kinds of political groups‚Äîthe group settled down on a farm in Fresenhagen, in North Germany which continued to be Reiser's refuge and place of inspiration even after moving back to Berlin a couple of years later. One of the band's most important and ambitious albums, the \\"Black Album\\", was recorded there. Ton Steine Scherben were musically very successful and, being one of the first rock bands in Germany which actually wrote and performed German rock songs, opened the door for countless successful German rock and pop bands to follow. Due to their refusal to adapt to the demands of the mainstream music business, as well as to financial mismanagement, a certain \\"outlawish\\" image in the eyes of the large radio and TV stations and a fan community which often forgot that the band had to make a living out of the music and would have despised any commercial ambitions, they were not able to translate their musical success and widespread popularity into financial stability. In 1985, Reiser and the band finally split, partly due to a feeling that it was time to move on, but to a large extent because of a disastrous financial situation. Reiser had a large debt with the group, but his early solo career went so well that he was free from debt in a short time. His first solo record-album was called \\"Rio I\\" and included the popular song K√∂nig von Deutschland (\\"King of Germany\\"). The album was produced by Annette Humpe, a renowned German music producer who had already produced Reiser's very first solo single, \\"Dr. Sommer\\", some time ago when he was in need of cash and had asked her for support. The song \\"K√∂nig von Deutschland\\" became one of the few real hits of Reiser, has been covered and cited by many artists ever since and is still known among most people in Germany. Other hit singles of the first album included the love song \\"F√ºr immer und dich\\" and the melancholic \\"Junimond\\". Reiser could not repeat the commercial success of the first album, nevertheless he released five further studio albums until his death, most of them highly praised by the critics. Many of his fans from the Ton Steine Scherben-days thought that he was selling out to mainstream, capitalist music business, and blamed him for becoming‚Äîat least for a period of time‚Äîa commercially successful musician. However, when listening closely to the lyrics, it can be noted that Reiser never abandoned his personal approach to music, politics, life and love, although the message was delivered in a more subtle way now. Reiser sometimes admitted that the objections to his solo music, even hatred by some old-time fans was a serious problem for him. Wandering on the edge of commercial adaptability, while trying to conform with the expectations of old friends, fans and political movements which he supported meant a difficult struggle for Reiser which sometimes drove him to despair and depression. At the same time, he continued to be a very creative, productive musician and songwriter who collaborated with other musicians and friends and underwent strenuous concert tours which often brought him close to physical exhaustion. One of the highlights of his career were two concerts performed in East Berlin in 1988 where he faced a sold-out concert hall filled with young people on the verge of the revolution which one year later led to the collapse of the political system of the German Democratic Republic and the opening of the Berlin wall. Recordings of the concerts prove that the east German audience knew the lyrics of his solo songs, and in particular all of the \\"Ton Steine Scherben\\" songs which he performed by heart, even though the albums were hard to come by in the GDR. Reiser wrote and performed most of his songs entirely by himself, although he was often accompanied by his longtime friend R.P.S. Lanrue who continued to support him as lead guitar player and also delivered many musical ideas, while a few of his song lyrics were also written by or together with his long-term partner Misha Schoeneberg. Reiser's sixth and last solo album, which was recorded in 1995, was called Himmel und H√∂lle (Heaven and Hell). The album was the last one which he was contractually obliged to deliver to his major music company, and both the musical approach as well as the lyrics imply that Reiser was about to return to a state of inner independence from the major business not only personally, but also in artistic terms, including a sound and concept which is often seen as more authentic than the previous studio albums. After the release of the last album, which was not strongly marketed by his company, even though praised by the critics, Reiser was preparing new songs which he would have produced independently again, the completion of which was interrupted by his sudden and unexpected death. Some critics say that Rio Reiser created a new image of a German folk singer; he was even called a \\"Schlager\\" artist, and a \\"Volksmusik\\" musician (sometimes translated as \\"folk music\\", but in a literary sense it means music of the people). To other critics, Rio Reiser was simply a singer in a rock band. However, Reiser sometimes approved of being referred to a Volksmusik musician, because he thought that this would simply mean he sang music for the people.  Death  Grave of Reiser in Berlin Rio Reiser died on 20 August 1996 from a circulatory collapse after internal bleeding at his home in Fresenhagen, where he was buried on his own property under an apple tree. His grave was moved to Berlin in March 2011, because Reiser's heirs sold the Fresenhagen property.

It was directed by Stanley Tong, with action choreographed by Chan and Tong. Released in Hong Kong in 1995, Rumble in the Bronx had a successful worldwide theater run, and brought Chan into the North American mainstream. The film is set in the Bronx area of New York City, but was filmed in and around Vancouver, Canada. The film grossed worldwide (approximately adjusted for inflation), against a budget, making it one of the most profitable films at the time. Plot Ma Hon Keung (Jackie Chan), a Hong Kong cop, comes to New York to attend the wedding of his Uncle Bill (Bill Tung). Uncle Bill owns the Wa-Ha Supermarket in The Bronx, an area with a high level of crime. He meets Bill's neighbor Danny (Morgan Lam), a disabled Chinese-American boy, and his aunt-to-be Whitney (Carrie Cain Sparks), an African-American woman working at Bill's supermarket. Bill is trying to sell his supermarket, and he meets a potential buyer, Elaine (Anita Mui), who is reluctant to buy it for Bill's price. Nonetheless, Bill invites Elaine to his wedding, hoping that there's still a chance to sell it. Unbeknownst to Keung and Elaine, Bill's market is a victim of frequent shoplifting and a protection racket, and he is desperate to sell it. The next day, at the wedding, Keung helps negotiate a deal that convinces Elaine to buy the market. One day, when Keung is helping Elaine at the market, members of a local biker gang led by Tony (Marc Akerstream)) attempt to shoplift many goods the market, but Keung thwarts and beats them. Later that night, Keung notices a woman (Francoise Yip) getting abducted. He scares away her would-be kidnappers. However, when Keung \\"rescues\\" the woman, she attacks him, revealing a ploy to lure him into a spot where Tony's gang attacks him again. Keung is cornered into a dead-end alleyway. The gang severely injures him with glass bottles. Afterwards, Keung almost makes it back to his Uncle's apartment, but not before fainting in front of Nancy, who is Tony's girlfriend and the woman who lured Keung earlier. It is revealed that Nancy is Danny's neglectful older sister. She fixes Keung's wounds upon realizing that he is also Danny's friend. Danny informs Keung about Nancy's help the next morning, but Keung still doesn't know that Nancy was the one who lured him. Later that morning, Keung goes to Elaine's market to inform her that he lost the contract (during the alleyway brawl with the gang). The supermarket is a mess due to a failed attempt to stop thieves, and Elaine informs Keung about her desire to back out of the deal upon realizing how often the market is a victim of theft and a protection racket. When two thugs demanding \\"protection money\\" come by, Keung scares them away. However, Tony and his gang come back to the store, demanding \\"compensation\\" for Keung hurting them earlier. Elaine gives into their demand, and they rob and vandalize the store. Keung confronts them outside, and tells the gang that he's the boss of the store and that he has called the police on them. The gang disperses upon the police's arrival. Later, Tony and his gang attempt to chase down Keung for revenge, which leads to Keung making a daring escape by jumping from the roof of a parking garage to a fire escape on a building across the street. Later, a member of Tony's gang named Angelo (Garvin Cross) gets involved in an illegal diamond deal gone bad and steals the diamonds. A criminal syndicate led by White Tiger (Kris Lord) is after the diamonds. Keung and Danny are outside together, and they witness some of the carnage go down. Keung and Danny run inside for safety, leaving Danny's wheelchair in the apartment hallway. Unable to run and hide from the syndicate, Angelo stuffs the diamonds in Danny's wheelchair cushion. Some of the syndicate members are arrested (along with Angelo), but all are let go due to a lack of evidence. Meanwhile, at Danny and Nancy's apartment, Nancy eavesdrops on a conversation between Keung and Danny, where she listens to Danny talk about the emotional difficulty of being disabled. Upon hearing this, she comes out into the living room and tearfully apologizes to Keung and Danny, while both Keung and Danny agree to keep their previous encounter a secret. Meanwhile, Elaine tries to scare away the thugs from the protection racket. However, they are not intimidated, and they assault her while taking her money. After this, she tries to sell the market to another Chinese couple, selling it using the same lies and tactics that Uncle Bill used to convince her. Keung witnesses this, and gives her back the check she used to buy the market, asking that she only pay him back once she makes money. Later that evening, Keung goes out, but not before being questioned by the syndicate men (who are posing as FBI agents) looking for the diamonds. They give Keung a number to call if he finds anything. Later Keung visits Nancy at a nightclub where she is a lingerie dancer and model. When the gangsters see this, they chase Keung and Nancy, but they escape after Nancy knocks over their motorcycles. Keung advises her to stay away from Tony's gang and to look after Danny. A romantic relationship develops between them. After failing to confront Keung, the bikers trash Elaine's supermarket. During the commotion, two of Tony's men are captured by White Tiger's men, who are searching for Angelo. Angelo's friends are unaware of his diamond heist and one of them is executed in a tree-shredder. Meanwhile, Keung and Nancy go to the bikers' headquarters after the latest supermarket attack, and Keung defeats them in another brawl. After the brawl, he berates and insults the gang for their criminal lifestyle and urges them to change for the better. Immediately after, one of the gangsters comes back to the hideout, with the executed gangster's remains, which he reveals was a warning to return the goods that Angelo stole. Keung agrees to help Tony and his gang find Angelo. Keung contacts the syndicate (which he thought was the FBI) after they find Angelo. Angelo reveals that he hid the diamonds in Danny's wheelchair. Tony, Angelo, and Nancy are taken hostage while some of White Tiger's thugs go with Keung to Danny and Nancy's apartment. Keung eventually subdues the gangsters after they find the diamonds. When White Tiger calls one of the gangsters, Keung takes the cell phone and reveals that he has his diamonds and his thugs held hostage. White Tiger tells him that he'll arrange an exchange and warns him not to contact the police. Keung makes Danny wait at school for his own safety. When one of the syndicate thugs interrogates Tony, demanding Keung's whereabouts, Tony tells him that Keung is the owner of the Wa-Ha supermarket. Keung goes to Elaine for advice, but later, the syndicate's thugs destroy the supermarket with a tow truck as a warning to Keung. Keung calls the police for help. They give Keung recording equipment and instruct him to just show the gangsters one diamond, and to try to get the gang to talk about the murder and robbery. However, during their meeting, Keung reveals that he knows of the name \\"White Tiger\\", which make the syndicate men realize that Keung is working with the police. They take Keung to a secret place to have him executed. But before they can execute him, Keung overpowers them and escapes. Later, the police come and chase the gangsters away. White Tiger's men hijack a hovercraft and are pursued by Keung and the New York Police Department in the Hudson River. The hovercraft ends up running through the streets, causing much damage to property. Keung ends the chase by stealing a large sword from a museum, clamping it onto a sports car window and driving into the hovercraft, shredding the rubber skirt and crashing the vehicle. Keung forces them to reveal White Tiger's location, Keung drives the repaired hovercraft to a golf course where White Tiger is playing. He runs them over, leaving White Tiger naked on the ground.

The shot still made it into the finished movie. In his autobiography, I am Jackie Chan: My life in Action, Jackie Chan talked about the initial difficulty of filming a movie in Vancouver that is set in New York. The production team initially had to put up fake graffiti during the day and take it all down during the evening, while simultaneously making sure that no mountains made it into the background. However, Chan decided that it was best that the production team focus on the action only without worrying too much about scenery. Viewers have noted mountains in the background, which are not present in the NYC landscape, as well as the NYC helicopter which displays a Canadian civil registration (C-GZPM - A Bell Jet Ranger). The original spoken dialogue consisted of all of the actors speaking their native language most of the time. In the completely undubbed soundtrack, available on the Warner Japanese R2 DVD release, Jackie Chan actually speaks his native Cantonese while Fran√ßoise Yip and Morgan Lam (the actors playing Nancy and Danny) speak English. All of the original dialogue was intended to be dubbed over in the international and Hong Kong film markets, and New Line cinema overdubbed and slightly changed the original English dialogue. During filming, Chan injured his right leg while performing a stunt. He spent much of the remaining shooting time with one leg in a cast. When it came to the film's climax, the crew colored a sock to resemble the shoe on his good foot, which Chan wore over his cast. His foot still had not completely healed when he went on to shoot his next film, Thunderbolt (filmed the same year, 1994, but released earlier in the U.S.). The lead actress and several stunt doubles were also injured during the shooting of a motorcycle stunt, with several people suffering broken limbs and ankles. The film had a production budget of . Release New Line Cinema acquired the film for international distribution and commissioned a new music score and English dub (with participation from Jackie Chan). A scene of Keung's airplane flying into John F. Kennedy International Airport was added to the opening credits. Three scenes were added exclusively for the international version: a shot of the syndicate's car pulling up to the diamond deal, Keung and Nancy escaping from the nightclub after the bikers spot them together, and White Tiger taking a golf shot before a subordinate approaches him with his phone. None of these scenes were in the original Hong Kong release. In comparison to the Hong Kong version, 17 minutes of cuts were made, and the new English dub changed some of the context of the characters' conversations. Keung being a cop and having a girlfriend in Hong Kong is never mentioned. Keung's father being shot by a robber years ago is also not mentioned. In the New Line Cinema edit, Elaine buys the grocery store upon her first meeting with Uncle Bill, but in the Hong Kong version, she decides to buy the market at Bill's wedding. The new soundtrack replaced Chan's song over the closing credits with the song \\"Kung Fu\\" by the band Ash, the lyrics of which mention Jackie Chan, as well as other Asian figures and characters ubiquitous in the west.

It was one of the most profitable films of 1996, grossing over ten times its budget. =Critical reception= When released in North America, Rumble in the Bronx received generally positive reviews, as most critics were happy that a Jackie Chan film was finally getting a wide theatrical release in North America. The film currently has an 80% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Most critics agreed that the plot and acting were lacking, but the action, stunts, and Chan's charm made up for it. Roger Ebert gave the film a positive review, rating it 3 out of 4 stars. His review for the Chicago Sun- Times stated: > \\"Any attempt to defend this movie on rational grounds is futile.

Skiing, or traveling over snow on skis, has a history of at least eight millennia. The earliest archaeological examples of skis were found in Russia and date to 6000 BCE. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, 5000-year-old wall paintings suggest use of skis in the Xinjiang region of what is now China; however, this continues to be debated. Originally purely utilitarian, starting in the mid-1800s skiing became a popular recreational activity and sport, becoming practiced in snow-covered regions worldwide, and providing a market for the development of ski resorts and their related communities. Etymology The word ski comes from the Old Norse word which means \\"cleft wood\\", \\"stick of wood\\" or \\"ski\\".Caprona, Yann de: Norsk etymologisk ordbok. Oslo: Kagge forlag, 2014. . In Old Norse common phrases describing skiing were fara √° sk√≠√∞um (to travel, move fast on skis), renna (to move swiftly) and skr√≠√∞a √° sk√≠√∞um (to stride on skis).Gr√∏nvik, Ottar (2000). OÃßndurd√≠s og oÃßndurgo√∞: studier over den f√∏rkristne religion i Norden. Oslo: Det norske videnskaps-akademi. . Modern Norwegian and Swedish, however, do not form a verb from the noun.Bleken, Brynjulv (1973). Riksm√•l og moderat bokm√•l: en sammenlignende oversikt. Oslo: Aschehoug. . Other languages make a verb form out of the noun, such as to ski in English, in French, in Spanish and Portuguese, in Italian, in Dutch, or (as above also or ) in German. Finnish has its own ancient words for skis and skiing: \\"ski\\" is and \\"skiing\\" is . The Sami also have their own words for \\"skis\\" and \\"skiing\\": for example, the Lule Sami word for \\"ski\\" is and skis are called . The Sami use for the verb \\"to ski\\" (the term may date back to 10,000 years before present). Early archaeological evidence Kalvtr√§skskidan at the ski exhibition in Ume√•. The oldest information about skiing is based on archaeological evidence. Two regions present the earliest evidence of skis and their use: the Altaic region of modern China where 5000-year-old paintings suggest the aboriginal use of skis, and northern Russia, where the oldest fragments of ski-like objects, dating from about 6300-5000 BCE were found about 1,200 km northeast of Moscow at Lake Sindor. =Rock carvings= Skier hunting with bow and arrow, Rock carvings at Alta, Norway, about 1000 BCE. The earliest Scandinavian examples of skiing date to 3000 or 4000 BCE with primitive carvings. An image of a skier holding a single pole or an ax with both hands, is found in Norway. The R√∏d√∏y carving shows skis of equal length. A rock carving at Norway, from about 1000 or 500 BCE depicts a skier seemingly about to shoot with bow and arrow, with skis positioned in an angle (rather than parallel) to offer good support.Weinstock, J. (2005). The Role of Skis and Skiing in the Settlement of Early Scandinavia. Northern Review, (25/26), 172-196. Rock drawings in Norway dated at 4000 BC depict a man on skis holding a stick. Near the White Sea in Russia, rock carvings were discovered in 1926 and dated to 2000 or 2500 BCE. One of the Russian carvings depicts hunting of big game with hunters on equal length skis. The hunters apparently used their bow and spear as poles. =Ski samples= The first primitive Scandinavian ski was found in a peat bog in Hoting in J√§mtland County in Sweden which dates back to 4500 or 2500 BCE. In 1938 a ski was found from Salla, Finland that has been dated back to 3245 BCE. Noted examples are the Kalvtr√§skskidan ski, found in Sweden and dated to 3300 BCE, and the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in Norway and dated to 3200 BCE.http://snl.no/ski/historikk accessed May 25, 2013. There are some 20 findings of ancient, well-preserved skis in drained bogs in Norway, indicating that skis have been widely used in Norway, particularly Northern Norway, since prehistoric times. Skis have also been uncovered in ancient graves.Gotaas, Thor: Norge: skisportens vugge. Oslo: Font forlag, 2011. In 2014, a ski complete with leather bindings, emerged from a glacier in Reinheimen mountains, Norway. The binding is at a small elevated area in the middle of the 172 cm long and 14,5 cm wide ski. According to the report the ski is some 1300 years old. A large number of organic artifacts have been well preserved for several thousand years by the stable glaciers of Oppland county and emerge when glaciers recede.Fant 1300 √•r gammel ski i Reinheimen, NRK News, published October 6, 2014, accessed October 11, 2014. A ski excavated in Greenland is dated to 1010. Based on findings in the Nordic countries and elsewhere, researchers have identified at least 3 main types: arctic, southern and central Nordic. The arctic type was short and covered with fur, and used from northern Japan in the east to Ob river in the west. The Sami people probably brought this type to the Nordic region. The southern type had one short and one long ski, and was used in forest areas of Southern Scandinavia and the Baltic countries. The central Nordic type also had one short with fur (the andor) and one long, and was used in large parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Skiing as transportation British troops with skis in Norway, April 1940 Norse mythology describes the god Ullr and the goddess Ska√∞i hunting on skis, Ullr and Ska√∞i has later been regarded as the god and goddess of skiing and hunting. Early historical evidence includes Procopius' (around CE 550) description of Sami people as skrithiphinoi (or skridfinns) translated as \\"ski running samis\\" (Sami people were commonly referred to as Finn). Birkely argues that the Sami people have practiced skiing for more than 6000 years, evidenced by the very old Sami word ƒçuoigat for skiing.Birkely, Hartvig (1994): I Norge har lapperne f√∏rst indf√∏rt skierne. Idut. Paulus Diaconus mentioned what may have been Sami and described how they chased animals by a twisted piece of wood that they painstakingly shaped into resembling a bow.Egil Skallagrimsson's 950 CE saga describes King Haakon the Good's practice of sending his tax collectors out on skis. The Gulating law (1274) stated that \\"No moose shall be disturbed by skiers on private land.\\" Fridtjof Nansen and his crew posing for the photographer with some of their gear for the 1888 Greenland expediton. From left: Ravna, Sverdrup, Nansen, Kristiansen, Dietrichson and Balto. Ravna and Balto in their Sami clothing. The saga of king Sverre of Norway reports how Sverre around year 1200 sent troops on ski to patrol the Aker area near Oslo. During Sverre's siege of T√∏nsberg Fortress, soldiers boldly skied down the steep cliff. According to the saga, Haakon IV of Norway as a baby in 1206 was transported by soldiers on skis through the hills between Gudbrandsdalen and √òsterdalen valleys, this event inspired modern day Birkebeinerrennet ski marathon. Ski warfare, the use of ski- equipped troops in war, is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. The speed and distance that ski troops are able to cover is comparable to that of light cavalry. Swedish writer Olaus Magnus's 1555 A Description of the Northern Peoples describes skiers and their climbing skins in Scricfinnia in what is now Norway. The garrison in Trondheim used skis at least from 1675, and the Danish-Norwegian army included specialized skiing battalions from 1747 - details of military ski exercises from 1767 are retained.Bergsland, Einar (1946): P√• ski. Oslo: Aschehoug. Skis were used in military exercises in 1747. In 1799 French traveller Jacques de la Tocnaye visited Norway and wrote in his travel diary: Norwegian immigrants used skis (\\"Norwegian snowshoes\\") in the US midwest from around 1836. Norwegian immigrant \\"Snowshoe Thompson\\" transported mail by skiing across the Sierra Nevada between California and Nevada from 1856. In 1888 Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his team crossed the Greenland icecap on skis. Norwegian workers on the Buenos Aires - Valparaiso railway line introduced skiing in South America around 1890. In 1910 Roald Amundsen used skis on his South Pole Expedition. In 1902 the Norwegian consul in Kobe imported ski equipment and introduced skiing to the Japanese, motivated by the death of Japanese soldiers during snow storm. Skiing as sport Ski jumping in Trondheim 1907 The first recorded organized skiing exercises and races are from military uses of skis in Norwegian and Swedish infantries. For instance details of military ski exercises in the Danish-Norwegian army from 1767 are retained: Military races and exercises included downhill in rough terrain, target practice while skiing downhill, and 3 km cross-country skiing with full military backpack. Slalom (Norwegian: slal√•m) is a word of Norwegian origin that has entered the international skiing vocabulary. In the 1800s skiers in Telemark challenged each other on \\"wild slopes\\" (ville l√•mir), more gentle slopes had the adjective \\"sla\\". Some races were on \\"bumpy courses\\" (kneikel√•m) and sometimes included \\"steep jumps\\" (spr√∏ytehopp) for difficulty. These 19th century races in Telemark ran along particularly difficult trails usually from a steep mountain, along timber-slides and ended with a sharp turn (\\"Telemark turn\\") on a field or icy lake.B√∏, Olav (1993).

On one leg the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and on the other a shorter ski for kicking. The bottom of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in similar manner to modern ski waxing. Early record of this type of skis survives in works of Olaus Magnus.Olaus Magnus, 1555:1,4 He associates them to Sami people and gives Sami names of savek and golos for the plain and skinned short ski. Finnish names for these are lyly and kalhu for long and short ski. The seal hunters at the Gulf of Bothnia had developed a special long ski to sneak into shooting distance to the seals' breathing holes, though the ski was useful in moving in the packed ice in general and was made specially long, 3‚Äì4 meters, to protect against cracks in the ice. This is called skredst√•ng in Swedish.\\"V√§sterbotten 1971 nr. 2\\" magazine in Swedish, includes copious pictures of the ski and the associated equipment. Around 1850 artisans in Telemark, Norway invent the cambered ski. This ski arches up in the middle, under the binding, which distributes the skier's weight more evenly across the length of the ski. Earlier plank-style skis had to be thick enough not to bow downward and sink in the snow under the skier's weight. Norheim's ski was also the first with a sidecut that narrowed the ski underfoot while the tip and tail remained wider. This enabled the ski to flex and turn more easily. In 1950 Howard Head introduced the Head Standard, constructed by sandwiching aluminum alloy around a plywood core. The design included steel edges (invented in 1928 in Austria,) and the exterior surfaces were made of phenol formaldehyde resin which could hold wax. This hugely successful ski was unique at the time in having been designed for the recreational market, rather than for racing. 1962: a fibreglass ski, Kneissl's White Star, was used by Karl Schranz to win two gold medals at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships. By the late '60s fibreglass had mostly replaced aluminum. In 1975 the torsion box ski construction design is patented. The patent is referenced by K√§stle, Salomon, Rottefella, and Madshus, but in fact torsion box skis became common beginning in 1962 with the introduction of the Dynamic VR7 and VR17 race skis. In 1993 Elan introduced the Elan SCX. These introduced a new ski geometry, common today, with a much wider tip and tail than waist. When tipped onto their edges, they bend into a curved shape and carve a turn. Other companies quickly followed suit, and it was realized in retrospect that \\"It turns out that everything we thought we knew for forty years was wrong.\\" The modern Twin-tip ski was introduced by Line in 1995. = Bindings = Old ski binding In the early days of skiing the binding was also similar to those of a contemporary snowshoe, generally consisting of a leather strap fastened over the toe of the boot. In the 1800s, skiing evolved into a sport and the toe strap was replaced by a metal clip under the toe. This provided much greater grip on the boot, allowing the ski to be pushed sideways. The heel strap also changed over time; in order to allow a greater range of motion, a spring was added to allow the strap to lengthen when the boot was rotated up off the ski. This buckled strap was later replaced by a metal cable. The cable binding remained in use, and even increased in popularity, throughout this period as cross-country skiing developed into a major sport of its own. Change eventually came through the evolution of the Rottefella binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.\\"About Us\\" , Rottefella It has now generally been replaced by the NNN system. The introduction of ski lifts in 1908 led to an evolution of skiing as a sport. In the past, skiers would have to ski or walk up the hills they intended to ski down. With the lift, the skiers could leave their skis on, and would be skiing downhill all the time. The need to unclip the heel for cross- country use was eliminated, at least at resorts with lifts. As lifts became more common, especially with the introduction of the chairlift in 1936, the ski world split into cross-country and downhill, a split that remains to this day. In 1937 Hjalmar Hvam broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding. = Boots = A typical \\"universal\\" ski boot of the leather era. This example, by G. H. Bass, includes an indentation around the heel where the cable binding would fit, and a metal plate at the toe for a Saf-Ski release binding. The leather strap is a \\"long thong\\", used by downhill skiers to offer some level of lateral control. Ski boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross-country skiing.Seth Masia \\"A Short History of Ski Boots\\" at SkiingHistory.org Modern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot.Wolfgang Lert, \\"A Binding Revolution\\", Ski Heritage Journal, March 2002, pp. 25-26 Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch became common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose. With the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. =Glide and grip= Johannes Scheffer in Argentoratensis Lapponi√¶ (History of Lapland) in 1673 probably gave the first recorded instruction for ski wax application He advised skiers to use pine tar pitch and rosin. Ski waxing was also documented in 1761. 1934 saw limited production of solid aluminum skis in France. Wax does not stick to aluminum, so the base under the foot included grips to prevent backsliding, a precursor of modern fish scale waxless skis. In 1970 waxless Nordic skis were made with fishscale bases. Klister, a sticky material, which provides grip on snow of all temperatures that has become coarse-grained as a result of multiple freeze- thaw cycles or wind packing, was invented and patented in 1913 by Peter √òstbye. Recent advancements in wax have been the use of surfactants, introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax, and fluorocarbons, introduced in 1986, to increase water and dirt repellency and increase glide. Many companies, including Swix, Toko, Holmenkol, Briko, and Maplus are dedicated to ski wax production and have developed a range of products to cover various conditions. =Poles= Early skiers used one long pole or spear. The first depiction of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741. In 1959 Ed Scott introduced the large- diameter, tapered shaft, lightweight aluminum ski pole.

In reggae, dancehall, calypso, soca, grime, and reggaeton parlance it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song. These genres consist of the riddim plus the \\"voicing\\" (vocal part) sung by the deejay. The resulting song structure is distinctive in many ways. A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens‚Äîor even hundreds‚Äîof songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances. Since the 1970s, riddims have accompanied reggae music and through the 1980s, more widely known as dancehall. As seen in dancehall music, there is a voicing part ‚Äì sung by the DJ ‚Äì over some riddim that has probably been widely used in many other songs. There is a unique establishment in the combination of riddims and voicing. This redistribution of riddims creates a complexity of diasporic transference through the constant re-versions which could be comparable to hip-hop‚Äôs use of sampling. The situation is certainly different from U.S. hip-hop as the redistribution of riddims is relative to the Jamaican culture that relied heavily on sound systems and studio production. With redistribution, there has been a tricky history with copyright laws in Jamaica. Since the culture heavily relied on sound systems and vinyl records since the early beginning, there was not a heavy implementation of copyright protections. Throughout the 70s and 80s, there still remained no formal copyright system, as the work of producers on various records remained often anonymous. By 1993, Jamaica finally established a copyright act, but producers still face difficulty in establishing profit. Through proper registration, many artists now work on negotiating their royalties and taking it more seriously. The unique nature of dancehall and riddims have been highly influential on the numerous remixes that now circulate R&B; and hip-hop music. Definition Some classic riddims, such as \\"Nanny Goat\\" and \\"Real Rock\\" both produced by Clement \\"Coxsone\\" Dodd, are essentially the accompaniment tracks of the original 1960s reggae songs with those names. Since the 1980s, however, riddims started to be originally composed by producers/beatmakers, who give the riddims original names and, typically, contract artists to voice over them. Thus, for example, \\"Diwali\\" is the name not of a song, but of a riddim created by Steven \\"Lenky\\" Marsden, subsequently used as the basis for several songs, such as Sean Paul's \\"Get Busy\\" and Bounty Killer's \\"Sufferer.\\"Goodman, Steve (2009). Sonic Warfare: Sound, Affect, and the Ecology of Fear, p.161. ; and Manuel, Peter, and Wayne Marshall (2006). \\"The Riddim Method: Aesthetics, Practice, and Ownership in Jamaican Dancehall,\\" in Popular Music 25(3), pp. 447-70. \\"Riddims are the primary musical building blocks of Jamaican popular songs.... At any given time, ten to fifteen riddims are widely used in dancehall recordings, but only two or three of these are the now ting (i.e., the latest riddims that everyone must record over if they want to get them played in the dance or on radio).... In dancehall performing, those whose timing is right on top of the rhythm are said to be riding di riddim.Stolzoff, Norman C. (2000). Wake the Town and Tell the People: Dancehall Culture in Jamaica, p.126. . Bass culture The bass culture of Jamaican sonic sensibilities is characterized with less emphasis on melody and large emphasis on the drum beats and low frequency bass vibrations to draw attention to the social grounding to the culture. These aspects of Jamaican music are expressed visually through the Dancehall choreography and its African inspired folk traditions, which emphasize earthly connection through flat-footed stamping and ‚Äúbumper-grinding sexually explicit choreography, where the bass note is struck by the body itself‚Äîdisplaying its fecundity and celebrating its fertility‚Äù This bass culture is also embodied sonically by the music‚Äôs heartbeat, the bass lines often described as riddims, produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These riddims offer a sonic foundation on top of which different other sounds are incorporated to form innumerable versions. Usage Riddims are the instrumental backgrounds of reggae, lovers rock, dub, ragga, dancehall, soca, bouyon, and also reggaeton, which itself is largely based on the Dem Bow and Poco riddims by Steely & Clevie from the early 1990s, feature a riddim, such as Ivy Queen and Sasha's \\"Dat Sexy Body\\", which uses the Bookshelf riddim produced by Tony Kelly of the K-Licious reggae label. In other musical contexts, a riddim would be called a groove or beat. In most cases, the term riddim is used in reference to the entire background track or rhythm section, but in older roots riddims, riddim is used to reference a certain bass line and drum pattern. Often a melody is associated with the riddim, and occasionally an artist will produce two different songs with the same riddim (e.g. Elephant Man's \\"Ele Melody\\" and \\"Father Elephant\\" were both produced using the Kopa riddim, produced by Supa Dups). Riddims began forming popular in the early 1960s with the evolving role of the DJ. The work of DJs became less of shouting throughout points during a song, but more focused on an aesthetic with the voicings over these instrumental riddims. A specific DJ, DJ U-Roy, revolutionized the practice with studio recordings of these DJ voicings as his recordings skyrocketed on the charts in Jamaica in the 70s, thus leading to the beginning stages of dancehall. Riddims, therefore, became the standard practice for dancehall as it has progressed. Today, the same practices combining riddim and voicing still takes precedence in dancehall. Other live performances like at clubs or along the streets feature the use of sound systems in which there are usually medleys of different songs that all use the instrumental accompaniment. Some urban contemporary songs may become riddims as well. The instrumental of Ne- Yo's \\"Miss Independent\\" became a popular riddim; many dancehall artists have recorded songs using the track. Other songs have inspired riddims as well, such as George Michael‚Äôs song ‚ÄúFaith\\", which became a riddim of the same name, The Cure's song \\"Close to Me\\", which became the Cure riddim, and R. Kelly‚Äôs \\"Snake\\", which became the Baghdad riddim. JoJo's \\"Baby It's You\\" inspired a hip hop fusion riddim in the mid-2000s. Whilst mainly reggae-based music, an emerging electronic music genre as a sub-genre of dubstep also called riddim has recently emerged. Types African in origin (see clave (rhythm) and bell pattern),Martin, Billy and Thress, Dan (2006). Riddim: Claves of African Origin, p.4. . riddims can generally be categorized into three types. One of the oldest types of riddim is the classical riddim providing roots reggae, dub, and lovers rock with instrumentals, such as Bam Bam, produced by Sly & Robbie. The second type is the ragga riddim backing raggamuffin and dancehall songs, such as the Juice riddim, produced by Richard \\"Shams\\" Browne. The third type is the digital riddim, such as Sleng Teng, Punaany Riddim & Duck Riddim produced by King Jammy. So-called digital riddims refer to riddims created around the time that Jamaican producers incorporated drum machines and synthesizers into reggae-music production (e.g. Big Stage Riddim - produced by Penthouse Records). Nowadays, however, most dancehall and soca riddims are created by electronic instruments, so, in essence, almost all are digital. A number of riddims take their name and influence from African-Jamaican religious drumming such as the Kumina riddim, created in 2002 by Sly and Robbie, and Burru. In creating riddims, there are many popular digital techniques that producers will use. For example, the Korg Triton keyboard and the Akai MPC are used often to create drum patterns, as well as other popular software and digital programs that Jamaican engineers are utilizing. Not only is digital software used, but acoustic instruments still are very important. In creating the instrumentals, usually riddims are created first and then the voicing part will take place afterward. There's fluidity in the fact that a riddim could have so many different voicings attached and on the flip side, a certain voicing could have so many different riddims which again reflects the diasporic transference. Producers Different producers often develop their own versions of the same riddim, such as the Punaany riddim, which has distinct versions crafted by Steely & Clevie and by Ward 21, the Buzz Riddim, which was produced by Troyton Rami & Roger Mackenzie and officially launched dancehall rapper Sean Paul into superstardom (\\"Gimme the Light\\" from the Buzz Riddim won them their first Grammy for Best Reggae Album). Different artists often perform on top of the same riddims with different lyrics and different vocal styles, ranging from singing to toasting. As an example, Beenie Man's song \\"My Wish\\", Mr. Vegas' song \\"Go Up\\", and T.O.K.'s \\"Man a Bad Man\\" are all based on the Juice riddim. Many riddims are named after the song that was recorded on that instrumental track for the first time (or, in some cases, the song that becomes the most popular on a given riddim). For example, the Satta Massagana riddim is named after the Abyssinians' original song \\"Satta Massagana\\". Notable reggae producers include: * Coxsone Dodd * Duke Reid * Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry * Bunny Lee * Sly & Robbie * Mikey Dread * Black Chiney * Bobby \\"Digital\\" Dixon * King Jammy * Dave Kelly * King Tubby * Steven \\"Lenky\\" Marsden * Henry \\"Junjo\\" Lawes * Joe Gibbs * Donovan Germain * Steely & Clevie * Bost & Bim Compilation albums Since 2000, Greensleeves Records has released a series of compilation albums, based on new and occasionally classic riddims, known as Greensleeves Rhythm Album series. In 2001, VP Records followed suit, releasing the Riddim Driven series. Also following suit was the Jet Star label, with its Riddim Rider series.

It expresses the solution in terms of the determinants of the (square) coefficient matrix and of matrices obtained from it by replacing one column by the column vector of right-hand-sides of the equations. It is named after Gabriel Cramer (1704-1752), who published the rule for an arbitrary number of unknowns in 1750, although Colin Maclaurin also published special cases of the rule in 1748 (and possibly knew of it as early as 1729). Cramer's rule implemented in a na√Øve way is computationally inefficient for systems of more than two or three equations. In the case of equations in unknowns, it requires computation of determinants, while Gaussian elimination produces the result with the same computational complexity as the computation of a single determinant. Cramer's rule can also be numerically unstable even for 2√ó2 systems. However, it has recently been shown that Cramer's rule can be implemented in O(n3) time, which is comparable to more common methods of solving systems of linear equations, such as Gaussian elimination (consistently requiring 2.5 times as many arithmetic operations for all matrix sizes), while exhibiting comparable numeric stability in most cases. General case Consider a system of linear equations for unknowns, represented in matrix multiplication form as follows: : Ax = b where the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and the vector x = (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)^\\\\mathsf{T} is the column vector of the variables. Then the theorem states that in this case the system has a unique solution, whose individual values for the unknowns are given by: : x_i = \\\\frac{\\\\det(A_i)}{\\\\det(A)} \\\\qquad i = 1, \\\\ldots, n where A_i is the matrix formed by replacing the -th column of by the column vector . A more general version of Cramer's rule considers the matrix equation : AX = B where the matrix has a nonzero determinant, and , are matrices. Given sequences 1 \\\\leq i_1 < i_2 < \\\\ldots < i_k \\\\leq n and 1 \\\\leq j_1 < j_2 < \\\\ldots < j_k \\\\leq m , let X_{I,J} be the submatrix of with rows in I := (i_1, \\\\ldots, i_k ) and columns in J := (j_1, \\\\ldots, j_k ) . Let A_{B}(I,J) be the matrix formed by replacing the i_s column of by the j_s column of , for all s = 1,\\\\ldots, k . Then : \\\\det X_{I,J} = \\\\frac{\\\\det(A_{B}(I,J))}{\\\\det(A)}. In the case k = 1 , this reduces to the normal Cramer's rule. The rule holds for systems of equations with coefficients and unknowns in any field, not just in the real numbers. Proof The proof for Cramer's rule uses just two properties of determinants: linearity with respect to any given column (taking for that column a linear combination of column vectors produces as determinant the corresponding linear combination of their determinants), and the fact that the determinant is zero whenever two columns are equal (which is implied by the basic property that the sign of the determinant flips if you switch two columns). Fix the index j of a column. Linearity means that if we consider only column j as variable (fixing the others arbitrarily), the resulting function (assuming matrix entries are in ) can be given by a matrix, with one row and n columns, that acts on column j. In fact this is precisely what Laplace expansion does, writing for certain coefficients C1, ..., Cn that depend on the columns of other than column j (the precise expression for these cofactors is not important here). The value is then the result of applying the one-line matrix to column j of . If is applied to any other column k of , then the result is the determinant of the matrix obtained from by replacing column j by a copy of column k, so the resulting determinant is 0 (the case of two equal columns). Now consider a system of linear equations in unknowns x_1, \\\\ldots,x_n, whose coefficient matrix is , with det(A) assumed to be nonzero: :\\\\begin{matrix}a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2+\\\\cdots+a_{1n}x_n&=&b;_1\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2+\\\\cdots+a_{2n}x_n&=&b;_2\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots&\\\\vdots\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{n1}x_1+a_{n2}x_2+\\\\cdots+a_{nn}x_n&=&b;_n.\\\\end{matrix} If one combines these equations by taking C1 times the first equation, plus C2 times the second, and so forth until Cn times the last, then the coefficient of will become , while the coefficients of all other unknowns become 0; the left hand side becomes simply det(A)xj. The right hand side is , which is applied to the column vector b of the right hand side . In fact what has been done here is multiply the matrix equation on the left by . Dividing by the nonzero number det(A) one finds the following equation, necessary to satisfy the system: :x_j=\\\\frac{L_{(j)}\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{b}}{\\\\det(A)}. But by construction the numerator is the determinant of the matrix obtained from by replacing column j by b, so we get the expression of Cramer's rule as a necessary condition for a solution. The same procedure can be repeated for other values of j to find values for the other unknowns. The only point that remains to prove is that these values for the unknowns, the only possible ones, do indeed together form a solution. But if the matrix is invertible with inverse , then will be a solution, thus showing its existence. To see that is invertible when det(A) is nonzero, consider the matrix M obtained by stacking the one-line matrices on top of each other for j = 1, ..., n (this gives the adjugate matrix for ). It was shown that where appears at the position j; from this it follows that . Therefore, :\\\\frac1{\\\\det(A)}M=A^{-1}, completing the proof. For other proofs, see below. Finding inverse matrix Let be an matrix. Then :A\\\\,\\\\operatorname{adj}A = (\\\\operatorname{adj}A)\\\\,A=\\\\operatorname{det}(A) I where adj(A) denotes the adjugate matrix of , is the determinant, and I is the identity matrix. If det(A) is invertible in R, then the inverse matrix of is :A^{-1} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\operatorname{det}(A)} \\\\operatorname{adj}(A). If R is a field (such as the field of real numbers), then this gives a formula for the inverse of , provided . In fact, this formula will work whenever R is a commutative ring, provided that det(A) is a unit. If det(A) is not a unit, then is not invertible.

Then, with help of determinants, and can be found with Cramer's rule as :\\\\begin{align} x &= \\\\frac{\\\\begin{vmatrix} {\\\\color{red}{c_1}} & b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\color{red}{c_2}} & b_2 \\\\end{vmatrix}}{\\\\begin{vmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\\\end{vmatrix}} = { {\\\\color{red}c_1}b_2 - b_1{\\\\color{red}c_2} \\\\over a_1b_2 - b_1a_2}, \\\\quad y = \\\\frac{\\\\begin{vmatrix} a_1 & {\\\\color{red}{c_1}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & {\\\\color{red}{c_2}} \\\\end{vmatrix}}{\\\\begin{vmatrix} a_1 & b_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & b_2 \\\\end{vmatrix}} = { a_1{\\\\color{red}c_2} - {\\\\color{red}c_1}a_2 \\\\over a_1b_2 - b_1a_2} \\\\end{align}. The rules for matrices are similar. Given :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{matrix}a_1x + b_1y + c_1z&= {\\\\color{red}d_1}\\\\\\\\\\\\a_2x + b_2y + c_2z&= {\\\\color{red}d_2}\\\\\\\\\\\\a_3x + b_3y + c_3z&= {\\\\color{red}d_3}\\\\end{matrix}\\\\right. which in matrix format is \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_1 & b_1 & c_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_2 & b_2 & c_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_3 & b_3 & c_3 \\\\end{bmatrix}\\\\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\\\\\\\\\ y \\\\\\\\\\\\ z \\\\end{bmatrix}=\\\\begin{bmatrix} {\\\\color{red}d_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\color{red}d_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ {\\\\color{red}d_3} \\\\end{bmatrix}.

In particular, Cramer's rule can be used to prove that the divergence operator on a Riemannian manifold is invariant with respect to change of coordinates. We give a direct proof, suppressing the role of the Christoffel symbols. Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold equipped with local coordinates (x^1, x^2, \\\\dots, x^n). Let A=A^i \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i} be a vector field. We use the summation convention throughout. :Theorem. :The divergence of A, : \\\\operatorname{div} A = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^i} \\\\left( A^i \\\\sqrt{\\\\det g} \\\\right), :is invariant under change of coordinates.'' Let (x^1,x^2,\\\\ldots,x^n)\\\\mapsto (\\\\bar x^1,\\\\ldots,\\\\bar x^n) be a coordinate transformation with non-singular Jacobian. Then the classical transformation laws imply that A=\\\\bar A^{k}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}} where \\\\bar A^{k}=\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^{k}}{\\\\partial x^{j}}A^{j}. Similarly, if g=g_{mk}\\\\,dx^{m}\\\\otimes dx^{k}=\\\\bar{g}_{ij}\\\\,d\\\\bar x^{i}\\\\otimes d\\\\bar x^{j}, then \\\\bar{g}_{ij}=\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^{m}}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{i}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^{k}}{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^{j}}g_{mk}. Writing this transformation law in terms of matrices yields \\\\bar g=\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)^{\\\\text{T}}g\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right), which implies \\\\det\\\\bar g=\\\\left(\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)\\\\right)^{2}\\\\det g. Now one computes :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{div} A &=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^{i}}\\\\left( A^{i}\\\\sqrt{\\\\det g}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\bar g}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^k}{\\\\partial x^{i}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^{i}}{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}}\\\\bar{A}^{\\\\ell}\\\\det\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\bar g}\\\\right). \\\\end{align} In order to show that this equals \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\bar g}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}}\\\\left(\\\\bar A^{k}\\\\sqrt{\\\\det\\\\bar{g}}\\\\right), it is necessary and sufficient to show that :\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}}{\\\\partial x^{i}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x^{i}}{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}}\\\\det\\\\\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!-1}\\\\right)=0\\\\qquad\\\\text{for all } \\\\ell, which is equivalent to :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial \\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}}\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right) =\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}}{\\\\partial x^{i}}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}x^{i}}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{k}\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}}. Carrying out the differentiation on the left-hand side, we get: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}}\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right) &=(-1)^{i+j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}x^{i}}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{j}}\\\\det M(ij)\\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2}x^{i}}{\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{\\\\ell}\\\\partial\\\\bar x^{j}}\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)\\\\frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)}\\\\det M(ij)=(\\\\ast), \\\\end{align} where M(ij) denotes the matrix obtained from \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right) by deleting the ith row and jth column. But Cramer's Rule says that :\\\\frac{(-1)^{i+j}}{\\\\det\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial\\\\bar{x}}\\\\right)}\\\\det M(ij) is the (j,i)th entry of the matrix \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\bar{x}}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right).

Computing derivatives implicitly Consider the two equations F(x, y, u, v) = 0 and G(x, y, u, v) = 0. When u and v are independent variables, we can define x = X(u, v) and y = Y(u, v). An equation for \\\\dfrac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} can be found by applying Cramer's rule. First, calculate the first derivatives of F, G, x, and y: :\\\\begin{align} dF &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} dx + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} dy +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial u} du +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial v} dv = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] dG &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} dx + \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} dy +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial u} du +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial v} dv = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] dx &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial X}{\\\\partial u} du + \\\\frac{\\\\partial X}{\\\\partial v} dv \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] dy &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial u} du + \\\\frac{\\\\partial Y}{\\\\partial v} dv. \\\\end{align} Substituting dx, dy into dF and dG, we have: :\\\\begin{align} dF &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) du + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right) dv = 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ [6pt] dG &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial u} \\\\right) du + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial v} \\\\right) dv = 0. \\\\end{align} Since u, v are both independent, the coefficients of du, dv must be zero. So we can write out equations for the coefficients: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} & = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial u} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u} & = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial u} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} & = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial v} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y} \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v} & = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial v}. \\\\end{align} Now, by Cramer's rule, we see that: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} = \\\\frac{\\\\begin{vmatrix} -\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial u} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\ -\\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial u} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y}\\\\end{vmatrix}}{\\\\begin{vmatrix}\\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial y} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial x} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial G}{\\\\partial y}\\\\end{vmatrix}}. This is now a formula in terms of two Jacobians: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial u} = -\\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial (F, G)}{\\\\partial (u, y)}\\\\right)}{\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial (F, G)}{\\\\partial(x, y)}\\\\right)}. Similar formulas can be derived for \\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial v}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial u}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial y}{\\\\partial v}. =Integer programming= Cramer's rule can be used to prove that an integer programming problem whose constraint matrix is totally unimodular and whose right-hand side is integer, has integer basic solutions. This makes the integer program substantially easier to solve. =Ordinary differential equations= Cramer's rule is used to derive the general solution to an inhomogeneous linear differential equation by the method of variation of parameters. Geometric interpretation Geometric interpretation of Cramer's rule. The areas of the second and third shaded parallelograms are the same and the second is x_1 times the first. From this equality Cramer's rule follows. Cramer's rule has a geometric interpretation that can be considered also a proof or simply giving insight about its geometric nature. These geometric arguments work in general and not only in the case of two equations with two unknowns presented here. Given the system of equations :\\\\begin{matrix}a_{11}x_1+a_{12}x_2&=b_1\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{21}x_1+a_{22}x_2&=b_2\\\\end{matrix} it can be considered as an equation between vectors :x_1\\\\binom{a_{11}}{a_{21}}+x_2\\\\binom{a_{12}}{a_{22}}=\\\\binom{b_1}{b_2}. The area of the parallelogram determined by \\\\binom{a_{11}}{a_{21}} and \\\\binom{a_{12}}{a_{22}} is given by the determinant of the system of equations: :\\\\begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a;_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{21}&a;_{22}\\\\end{vmatrix}. In general, when there are more variables and equations, the determinant of vectors of length will give the volume of the parallelepiped determined by those vectors in the -th dimensional Euclidean space. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram determined by x_1\\\\binom{a_{11}}{a_{21}} and \\\\binom{a_{12}}{a_{22}} has to be x_1 times the area of the first one since one of the sides has been multiplied by this factor. Now, this last parallelogram, by Cavalieri's principle, has the same area as the parallelogram determined by \\\\binom{b_1}{b_2}=x_1\\\\binom{a_{11}}{a_{21}}+x_2\\\\binom{a_{12}}{a_{22}} and \\\\binom{a_{12}}{a_{22}}. Equating the areas of this last and the second parallelogram gives the equation :\\\\begin{vmatrix}b_1&a;_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\b_2&a;_{22}\\\\end{vmatrix} = \\\\begin{vmatrix}a_{11}x_1&a;_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{21}x_1&a;_{22}\\\\end{vmatrix} =x_1 \\\\begin{vmatrix}a_{11}&a;_{12}\\\\\\\\\\\\a_{21}&a;_{22}\\\\end{vmatrix} from which Cramer's rule follows. Other proofs=A proof by abstract linear algebra = This is a restatement of the proof above in abstract language. Consider the map \\\\vec{x}=(x_1,\\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\mapsto \\\\frac{1}{\\\\det A} (\\\\det (A_1),\\\\ldots, \\\\det(A_n)), where A_i is the matrix A with \\\\vec{x} substituted in the ith column, as in Cramer's rule. Because of linearity of determinant in every column, this map is linear. Observe that it sends the ith column of A to the ith basis vector \\\\vec{e}_i=(0,\\\\ldots, 1, \\\\ldots, 0) (with 1 in the ith place), because determinant of a matrix with a repeated column is 0. So we have a linear map which agrees with the inverse of A on the column space; hence it agrees with A^{-1} on the span of the column space. Since A is invertible, the column vectors span all of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, so our map really is the inverse of A. Cramer's rule follows. =A short proof= A short proof of Cramer's rule can be given by noticing that x_1 is the determinant of the matrix :X_1=\\\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 & 1 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ x_3 & 0 & 1 & \\\\dots & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots &\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_n & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix} On the other hand, assuming that our original matrix is invertible, this matrix X_1 has columns A^{-1}b, A^{-1}v_2, \\\\ldots, A^{-1}v_n , where v_n is the n-th column of the matrix . Recall that the matrix A_1 has columns b, v_2, \\\\ldots, v_n , and therefore X_1=A^{-1}A_1. Hence, by using that the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of the determinants, we have : x_1= \\\\det (X_1) = \\\\det (A^{-1}) \\\\det (A_1)= \\\\frac{\\\\det (A_1)}{\\\\det (A)}. The proof for other x_j is similar. = Proof using Clifford algebra = Consider the system of three scalar equations in three unknown scalars x_1, x_2, x_3 :\\\\begin{align} a_{11} x_{1} +a_{12} x_{2} +a_{13} x_{3} & = c_{1}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{21} x_{1} +a_{22} x_{2} +a_{23} x_{3} & = c_{2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{31} x_{1} +a_{32} x_{2} +a_{33} x_{3} & = c_{3} \\\\end{align} and assign an orthonormal vector

a_{13} \\\\mathbf{e}_{1} +a_{23} \\\\mathbf{e}_{2} +a_{33} \\\\mathbf{e}_{3} \\\\end{align} Adding the system of equations, it is seen that :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{c} & = c_{1} \\\\mathbf{e}_{1}

Incompatible and indeterminate cases A system of equations is said to be incompatible or inconsistent when there are no solutions and it is called indeterminate when there is more than one solution. For linear equations, an indeterminate system will have infinitely many solutions (if it is over an infinite field), since the solutions can be expressed in terms of one or more parameters that can take arbitrary values. Cramer's rule applies to the case where the coefficient determinant is nonzero. In the 2√ó2 case, if the coefficient determinant is zero, then the system is incompatible if the numerator determinants are nonzero, or indeterminate if the numerator determinants are zero. For 3√ó3 or higher systems, the only thing one can say when the coefficient determinant equals zero is that if any of the numerator determinants are nonzero, then the system must be incompatible. However, having all determinants zero does not imply that the system is indeterminate. A simple example where all determinants vanish (equal zero) but the system is still incompatible is the 3√ó3 system x+y+z=1, x+y+z=2, x+y+z=3.

W. Borgward (1890‚Äì1963). It produced cars of four brands, which were sold to a diversified international customer base: Borgward, Hansa, Goliath and Lloyd. Borgward's Isabella was one of the most popular German premium models in the 1950s, while Lloyd's Alexander / Lloyd 600 model offered affordable mobility to many working-class motorists. The group ceased operations in 1961, following controversial insolvency proceedings. The brand was revived in the 21st century, with the Stuttgart-based Borgward Group AG designing and marketing cars manufactured in China. Origins of the component companies The origins of the company go back to 1905 with the establishment in Varel (near Bremen) of Hansa Automobilgesellschaft and the foundation in Bremen itself of NAMAG, maker of the Lloyd car. These two businesses merged in 1914 to form the \\"Hansa-Lloyd-Werke A.G.\\". After the war, in the troubled economic situation then confronting Germany, the business failed to prosper and by the late 1920s faced bankruptcy. For Carl Borgward, already the successful creator of the Goliath-Blitzkarren business, the misfortunes of Hansa-Lloyd presented an opportunity to greatly expand the scope of his auto business, and he took control of it. Carl Borgward's first \\"car\\", the Blitzkarren The first \\"automobile\\" Carl Borgward designed was the 1924 Blitzkarren (lightning cart), a tiny three-wheeled van with , which was an enormous success in the market gap it filled. Traders with a small budget bought it for delivery. The Reichspost ordered many of them for postal service. Hansa-Lloyd In 1929, Borgward became the director of Hansa-Lloyd AG having been able to merge his Goliath-Werke Borgward & Co. with Hansa-Lloyd. The small Goliath-Blitzkarren had by now evolved into the three-wheeled timber-framed synthetic-leather- bodied 5 or 7 hp Goliath Pionier. Borgward turned his attention to the other businesses and led the development of the Hansa Konsul. In February 1937, there came the new Hansa Borgward 2000 and in 1939 its name was shortened to Borgward 2000.Odin, L.C. World in Motion 1939 - The whole of the year's automobile production. Belvedere Publishing, 2015. ASIN: B00ZLN91ZG. The 2000 model was followed by the Borgward 2300 which remained in production until 1942. After World War II, in 1946 Carl Borgward used some of the brand names from businesses he had acquired over the years to found three separate companies: Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd. This was intended to increase the quantity of steel allocated to his business at a time of austerity and rationing. For many purposes the companies would be run as a single entity; but in a business operated by a man to whom delegation did not come naturally, the proliferation of legal entities nevertheless added unhelpful layers of complexity through the 1950s and encouraged a broadening of the range which in the end proved financially unsustainable with the sales volumes achievable. In 1949 the company presented the Borgward Hansa 1500. One of the top engineers at Borgward from 1938-1952 was Dipl. Ing. Hubert M. Meingast. Isabella and P100 Production of the Borgward Isabella began in 1954. The Isabella would become Borgward's most popular model and remained in production for the life of the company. In 1959 the Borgward P100 was introduced, equipped with pneumatic suspension.Peter Kurze: Borgward Typenkunde. Delius Klasing Verlag, Bielefeld 2009, , Page 84 and 96. Sports racers Borgward introduced a line of 1500 cc sports racers in the 1950s, with the 16-valve engine from these becoming a successful Formula Two power unit (which was also used by some F1 privateers in 1961).Heinrich Volker: Silberpfeile aus Bremen ‚Äì Rennsportwagen der Borgward-Werke. Verlag Peter Kurze, Bremen 2004, . Financial problems Although Borgward pioneered technical novelties in the German market such as air suspension and automatic transmission, the company had trouble competing in the marketplace. While larger companies like Opel and VW took advantage of economies of scale and kept their prices low to gain market share, Borgward's cost structure was even higher than necessary for its size, as it basically operated as four tiny independent companies and never implemented such basic cost reduction strategies as joint development and parts sharing between the company's makes. Borgward suffered quality problems as well. The Lloyd Arabella was technically advanced as a water-cooled boxer with front wheel drive, but plagued with problems such as water leakage and gearbox software glitches. Lloyd lost money on the car even though it was more expensive than its direct competitors. Controversial company bankruptcy In 1961, the company was forced into liquidation by creditors. Carl Borgward died in July 1963, still insisting the company had been technically solvent. This proved to be true in the sense that after the creditors were paid in full, there was still 4.5 million Marks left over from the business.Borgward History = Controversy over the bankruptcy persists = Reports of difficulties at Borgward surfaced in an article that appeared in Germany's news magazine Der Spiegel on 14 December 1960. A Spiegel article was highlighted by means of a picture of Borgward, cigar in mouth, on the magazine's front cover. It was strongly critical of his business approach, and included many of the arguments later advanced to explain or justify the company's demise. The widest range of cars from any manufacturer in Germany, produced by three till recently operationally autonomous companies (Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd) was supporting a turnover of only 650 million Marks, placing the overall sales value from the combined Borgward auto businesses only in fifth position among Germany's auto-makers. The 70-year-old Carl Borgward's \\"hands-on\\" insistence on an increasingly manic proliferation of new and modified models featuring adventurous, but under-developed technological innovations (fast manisch[e] Konstruierwut) gave rise to components which too often did not work, broke down or fell apart, resulting in massive bills for pre-delivery remediation and/or post delivery warranty work that found their way back to the company. The December 1960 Der Spiegel article was not the only serious public criticism targeting Borgward at this time: suddenly stridently negative (if more succinct) comments also turned up in the mass-market Bild newspaper and in television reports. Critical media commentaries also appeared concerning large loans to the Borgward Group provided by the local Landesbank. It is apparent that the business was confronting cash-flow difficulties at the end of 1960. Capital intensive businesses such as auto manufacturing use their expensive machines and tools most efficiently if they use them constantly at full capacity, but the car market in Europe in the 1950s/60s was more seasonal than today, with sales diminishing in Winter, then peaking in the early summer months: Borgward's inventory of unsold cars at the end of 1960 was higher than usual, reflecting ambitious growth plans, most obviously in respect of the United States market The December 1960 Der Spiegel article speculated that of the 15,000 Borgward cars ordered by the North American dealers in 1960 (and of the 12,000 delivered to them) 6,000 might have to be taken back following a slump in North American demand. (Borgward was not the only European auto maker hit by a North American slump in demand for imported cars during 1960. In the same year two ships carrying Renault Dauphines were turned back in mid- Atlantic because the docks in New York were overcrowded with unsold Dauphines.\\") At the end of December 1960 Borgward approached the bank for a further one million Marks of credit, the loan to be backed by a guarantee from the Bremen regional government which initially the Bremen senators agreed to provide. However, following the flood of critical press comment the senators withdrew their guarantee. They now required Carl Borgward to pledge the company itself to the state in return for the guarantee. After a tense 13-hour meeting widely reported in a still hostile media, Borgward agreed to the senate‚Äôs terms on 4 February 1961, thereby averting the bankruptcy of the business. The Bremen Senate also insisted on appointing its own nominee as chairman of the company‚Äôs supervisory board. The man they chose was Johannes Semler whom reports generally describe as a ‚ÄúWirtschaftspr√ºfer‚Äù (public auditor), though this designation, especially once translated into English, does less than full justice to the breadth of Semler‚Äôs career. He had studied law at university and worked initially as a lawyer. The scion of a leading Hamburg political family, in 1945 he had himself been a founding member of the centre-right CSU party, and was a member of the Bundestag between 1950 and 1953. Despite his Hamburg origins, Semler was by this time based in Munich, with a network of contacts in the Bavarian establishment that probably included fellow CSU politician and the future German chancellor, Ludwig Erhard, who in 1948 had succeeded Semler in a top administrative position within the Bizone. The appointment of Johannes Semler as the representative of the Bremen senators to chair the Borgward supervisory board would, in retrospect, contribute to the controversy that followed the Borgward bankruptcy. alt= On 28 July 1961, Semler, as Chairman of the supervisory board, joined the directors of the three companies Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd to instigate proceedings for the establishment of a ‚ÄúVergleichsverfahren‚Äù, which would have provided for a court sanctioned scheme of arrangement enabling the business to continue to trade while at the same time protecting the interests of creditors.A similar process in the USA would involve a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Two months later, however, in September 1961, the Borgward and Goliath businesses were declared bankrupt, followed in November by the Lloyd business. Subsequent ‚Äúconspiracy theorists‚Äù have suggested that Semler, for reasons of his own, never had any intention of allowing the Borgward auto-businesses to survive. =Conspiracy theory= Carl Borgward himself would not accept that the Borgward, Goliath and Lloyd auto businesses were technically insolvent, and the fact that none of the companies‚Äô creditors lost money supports his case. In the light of what was known at the time, and increasingly in the light of subsequent events, the argument that the business was not really insolvent at all has, if anything, gained support. Nevertheless, evaluation of the issues requires informed and careful judgement, and the opposite case can also be made, that had the company continued trading beyond 1961 there was no reasonable prospect that it would generate sufficient cash to repay existing debts within a contractually established or reasonable period nor, indeed, to repay all necessary subsequently incurred financing and other business debts. At best, Borgward by the middle of 1961 was seen by potential investors and lenders as a much riskier prospect than it had been a year earlier. Case for a conspiracy It has been suggested that the media onslaught launched against Borgward at the end of 1960 was part of a well orchestrated covert campaign by other German auto-makers, jealous of Borgward's success and spotting an opportunity to eliminate a significant rival. Even now, the Spiegel article of 14 December 1960 is strangely shrill, partisan, and out of line with the dry tone that characterised most serious business reporting at the time. Johannes Semler, appointed by the city fathers to chair the supervisory board, ostensibly in order to guide the business towards a more secure future, appeared a strange choice for the role despite his excellent network of contacts and long experience at the interface between business and public life. The appointment appeared stranger still after his simultaneous appointment, in 1960, to the board of BMW in Munich, his more recent political power base and by now his adopted home city. BMW had lost its old manufacturing facility in 1945 when Eisenach had ended up under Soviet control and since then had itself struggled to survive financially. =Cui bono?= In fact, the appointment of Semler to the BMW board was one of several events which, in rapid succession, marked an improvement in the fortunes of BMW. BMW had itself come close to bankruptcy in 1959, but had been rescued thanks to a massive additional investment by Herbert Quandt, who became, behind the scenes, a remarkably successful ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù principal BMW shareholder. Key to the company's future was a new saloon/sedan smaller and more sporty than a Mercedes-Benz yet larger than a Volkswagen, and more stylish than anything then to be expected from Opel or Ford. Quandt also recruited an energetic sales director for BMW called Paul G. Hahnemann who later would assert that the BMW 1500, launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 1961, created an important new niche in the German car market. Hahnemann repeated his boast so often that he gained the soubriquet \\"Nischen- Paule\\" in the press. Those who contend that Semler's role in the Borgward bankruptcy was part of a conspiracy orchestrated on behalf of BMW to bring down Borgward point out that the ‚Äúniche‚Äù allegedly defined by the mid-weight BMWs from 1961 bore an uncanny resemblance to the niche previously occupied by the Borgward Isabella during the 1950s. Case against a conspiracy Cases against conspiracies are seldom as compelling as cases in support of conspiracies. Nevertheless, Carl Borgward's management style had never been collegial, and during several decades as a swash-buckling engineer- entrepreneur he had never shown much appetite for opinions at variance with his own. The Spiegel article that kicked off the press onslaught in December 1960 included a withering attack on Borgward for having recently laid off 2,000 people as part of a belated attempt to streamline administration and production. In a period of boom there was little doubt that the affected workers would have found job opportunities with other German automakers, but they would have needed to relocate away from Bremen, and the Spiegel's description of Carl Borgward's implementation of the redundancies savagely implied a singular absence of human sensitivity. One way and another, Borgward had over several decades enjoyed plenty of opportunities to create enemies, able to feed toxic stories to the media without any need for a conspiracy among rival auto-makers. Borgward's approach to ‚Äúproduct planning‚Äù was remarkably profligate. In West Germany only Opel, at this time, came close to Borgward in terms of frequency of model changes and facelifts. But Opel were backed by the financial muscle and the strong management support of General Motors, the world's largest auto-maker and at that time itself a fabulously profitable corporation. In contrast, Borgward had only a generous (but not bottomless) credit facility from the local state bank which he coupled with a personal disinclination to delegate or discuss business decisions. Opel, for all their flamboyant marketing and a domestic market share second only to that of Volkswagen, at this time offered only two models, the Rekord and the Kapit√§n. It is difficult to keep up with how many different models the Borgward group was supporting. In addition to various commercial vehicles, the 1961 passenger car range included the Lloyd Alexander, the Lloyd Arabella, the Goliath 1100 (rebadged in 1959 as the Borgward 1100), the Borgward Isabella and the Borgward P100. The company's reputation for serious teething troubles on new models was not simply the result of malicious press reporting. Borgward was managed by a 70-year-old autocrat without an obvious succession plan. At the height of the crisis talks in 1961 Carl Borgward received (and robustly rejected) a 200 Million Mark offer for his business from Chrysler corporation. Even without his own personal BMW connections, chairman Semler might reasonably have concluded that the Borgward business as then configured had no realistic prospect of remaining solvent for more than few more months without collapsing into a yet more destructive bankruptcy from which creditors would not recover all their cash, and which could easily end up with the company becoming a third significant foreign transplant to compete on financially unequal terms with the domestically-owned auto industry. =Post mortem= The German magazine Der Spiegel published a thoughtful piece in 1966, implying that with a little more support, and if the proprietor had been more willing to take advice from his own directors, the Borgward company could have easily overcome its financial problems of 1961. But Carl Borgward was financially naive and reluctant to accept advice: his preferred source of credit had always involved shunning the banks and simply taking extra time to pay his creditors, rejecting advice on the financing of his business from his own Finance Director. By Autumn 1960 he was holding on to unpaid creditor invoices worth more than 100 Million Marks for sheet metal and tyres alone.History of Borgward Given that all the company's creditors were eventually paid in full, the liquidation decision appeared nevertheless to have been taken prematurely. =Production in Argentina= Borgward Argentina was founded in 1954 as a joint venture of Carl F. Borgward HMBH and IAME (Aeronautics and Mechanical Industries) intended to equip the Rastrojero, a small pickup truck. The engine was manufactured at the plant that Borgward had in the town of Isidro Casanova, Buenos Aires province, at a production rate of 20 units per day with almost 800 employees. The production of Borgward Isabella was carried out in Cordoba city, by using Argentine engines, local components (glass, batteries, tires) and other pieces from Germany. This model production started in 1960 at the booming of Argentina automotive industry development, with a production plan of 500 units for that year. When the German parent company closed its doors in 1961, the operation happened to have local control, and continued for a short time to complete the total manufacture of 1,050 cars during its short life in Argentine territory. =Production in Mexico= As part of the bankruptcy process, in 1963, all manufacturing equipment for the Borgward Isabella and P100 was sold to a buyer in Monterrey, Mexico. Production in Mexico was delayed, but was started in August 1967 by entrepreneur Gregorio Ramirez Gonzalez. Production in Mexico ceased in 1970. Revival Borgward BX7 at IAA 2015 In 2008, the Borgward Group AG was formed in Lucerne by Christian Borgward (grandson of Carl F. W. Borgward) and Karlheinz L. Kn√∂ss. The new company later moved to Stuttgart. With both investment and manufacture by Beiqi Foton Motor (a subsidiary of BAIC, a major Chinese automotive group), the Borgward group had started to sell SUVs by January 2017.
