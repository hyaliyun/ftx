Political views  Sharfuddin Ahmad thinks that political empowerment is the key for those communities which are being harassed and victimised by different kinds of atrocities because of their personal identity such as Dalits, Minorities, Progressives, etc. Recently, he gave the suggestion to waive off all the farmer loans to save them from committing suicide. He also raised worries regarding the unpatriotic and anti- nationals labels put on various people and said that now a constitutional crisis is being developed. He said that the caste terror is being developed by some organisations in the country and the democracy of the country is at stake.

He is the Tocqueville Associate Professor of Religion & Public Life in the Department of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame. He is the author of a book on three of the Founding Fathers' views on the separation of church and state in the United States, and the editor of a second book on Supreme Court cases on religious liberty. Early life Vincent Phillip Mu√±oz graduated from Claremont McKenna College, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1993. He went on to earn a master of arts degree from Boston College in 1995 and a PhD from the Claremont Graduate University in 2001. Career Mu√±oz is Tocqueville Associate Professor of Religion & Public Life in the Department of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame. He is also the director of the Tocqueville Program for Inquiry into Religion and Public Life and the Potenziani Program in Constitutional Studies. In March 2017, Mu√±oz invited Charles Murray to campus despite opposition from junior faculty and students; he argued that Murray's presence would signal that Notre Dame is a safe space for free speech. Mu√±oz authored God and the Founders: Madison, Washington, and Jefferson in 2009. The book analyzes the different positions on church and state of three Founding Fathers (James Madison, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson) and contextualizes them in modern-day judicial conundra like school prayers or public funding of religious institutions. It won the Hubert Morken Award from the American Political Science Association in 2011. The book was widely reviewed. In Perspectives on Politics, Professor Isaac Kramnick of Cornell University, called it a \\"very important book\\", although he regretted Mu√±oz's decision to look at only three founders, concluding that other founders could illuminate modern-day jurists further. Meanwhile, in Law and History Review, Professor Mark D. McGarvie of the College of William and Mary argued that the ahistorical nature of the analysis was problematic, but that the book was nevertheless engaging. Professor Ellis M. West of the University of Richmond dismissed the book for lacking \\"balance and nuance\\", despite recognizing that Mu√±oz is correct to argue that \\"none of the Founders believed that religious liberty gave people the right to be exempt from obeying valid laws that unintentionally burden the exercise of their religion.\\" Furthermore, in Revue fran√ßaise de science politique, Professor Fran√ßois Foret of the Universit√© libre de Bruxelles praised Mu√±oz for laying out the differences between the Founders. Finally, in a review for the Journal of the Early Republic, Professor Mark Y. Hanley of Truman State University praised the book for \\"granting the founders their separate ways while acknowledging the continuing vitality of their political and philosophical ideas that can still offer Constitutional guidance in a new century.\\" Mu√±oz edited a second book, Religious Liberty and the American Supreme Court: The Essential Cases and Documents, in 2015. It is a collection of Supreme Court cases on religious liberty, with annotations by Mu√±oz.

Class 351000 trains were manufactured and delivered between 1993 and 2013.  Technical details  =Formation= The Class 351000 cars are arranged in 6-car trains. Details of the car types of each train are listed below: 3510XX (ex-20XX) - Tc (trailer driving car with SIV, air compressor, and battery) 3511XX (ex-22XX) - M (motor car with inverter and controller) 3512XX (ex-23XX) - M' (motor car with pantograph, transformer, inverter, and controller) 3513XX (ex-24XX) - T (trailer car) 3514XX (ex-25XX) - M' 3519XX (ex-21XX) - Tc = Electrical parts = Trains 351-09, 351-11~351-12, 351-14, 351-17~351-18, and 351-20~351-28 use Toshiba GTO-based VVVF controls with active cooling, while all other trains use IGBT controls with passive cooling through a heat pipe. The trains are equipped with regenerative braking, reducing energy consumption and simplifying train inspection. The trains feature a more powerful air conditioning system than that on the Class 1000 trains. = Interior design = The 1st and 2nd generation Class 351000 trains used an ivory-colored interior with a long sheet prior to their overhauls. All 1st and 2nd generation trains, as well as subsequent generation, use a white interior. LED display monitors are installed on the top of each car. The end cars have a space for wheelchairs. = Cabin = The Class 351000 trains equipped with TGIS use color displays, and service machines can be automatically controlled in TGIS after a refurbishment of these trains in 2005. Dead section notifiers are also installed.  Depot  The Class 351000 trains used on the Bundang Line are stored at the Bundang Depot, which is located between Jukjeon Station and Bojeong Station. The Class 351000 trains used on the Suin Line are stored at the Siheung Depot, which is located between Oido Station and Darwol Station. Generations = 1st generation = Class 351000 (1st generation) train 351-06 (ex-Class 2030 train 2-57) The first generation of Class 351000 trains were built from 1993 to 1999 by Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries. Because of the flat front ends, the trains are nicknamed \\"flat face\\" (ÎÇ©ÏûëÏù¥). The trains are numbered 351-01~351-22; the trains were renumbered from trains 2-47~2-48, 2-50, 2-55~2-69, and 2-73~2-76. Trains 351-01~341-18 were manufactured from 1993 to 1995 by Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hanjin Heavy Industries to address the opening of the Bundang Line from Suseo Station to Ori Station. Meanwhile, trains 351-19~351-22 were manufactured in 1999 by Hanjin Heavy Industries to expand the rolling stock on Bundang Line. = 2nd generation = Class 351000 (2nd generation) train 351-27 (ex-Class 2030 train 2-86) The second generation of Class 351000 trains were built in 2003 by ROTEM (Railroading Technology System) to address the extension of the Bundang Line from Suseo Station to Seolleung Station. The car body as a whole was redesigned; the cab ends of the driving cars were changed completely, and the side windows are now coated and in a single piece (as opposed to the two-window setup between doors). Because of the circular front view, the trains are nicknamed \\"round face\\" (ÎèôÍ∏ÄÏù¥). The trains are numbered 351-23~351-28. = 3rd generation = Class 351000 (3rd generation) train 351-61 on the Suin Line, prior to its repaint The third generation Class 351000 trains were built from 2011 to 2014 by Hyundai Rotem to address numerous extensions of the Bundang Line as well as the opening and the first extension of the rebuilt Suin Line. The front ends have been updated once again, and the trains feature snake-like headlights, giving the trains the nickname \\"Î±ÄÎààÏù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"snake eyes\\"). The interior was also updated, and the door motors are now electric-powered as opposed to air- powered. The third generation trains operating on the Bundang Line are numbered 351-29~351-43, while the third generation trains operating on the Suin Line are numbered 351-61~351-72. Trains 351-29~351-33 and 351-61~351-68 were manufactured in 2011 to address the extension of the Bundang Line from Bojeong Station to Giheung Station, and the opening of the rebuilt Suin Line from Oido Station to Songdo Station. Because the Suin Line had not yet opened before the trains were delivered, trains 351-61~351-64 provided additional service on the former Jungang Line when existing trains on the line were suddenly reduced from eight cars to six cars. Trains 351-34~351-40 were originally manufactured in 2012 to address the extension of the Bundang Line from Giheung Station to Mangpo Station. These trains originally used two converted Class 321000 cars per train, but when the Class 321000 trains were re-extended to eight cars per train, the trains were taken out of service until two new cars were created per train in 2014. Trains 351-41~351-43 and 351-69~351-72 were manufactured in 2013 to address the extension of the Bundang Line from Mangpo Station to Suwon Station and the extension of the Suin Line from Songdo Station to Incheon Station. They were among the first cars to be delivered with LED headlights. Because the Suin Line extension had not yet opened before the trains were delivered, trains 351-69~351-72 provided additional service on the Bundang Line while trains 351-34~351-40 were held out of service. = 4th generation = The fourth generation Class 351000 trains were built in 2017 by Hyundai Rotem to address the final extension of the rebuilt Suin Line, which is envisioned to interconnect with the Bundang Line and create a seamless \\"Bundang-Suin\\" line. The front ends have been updated once again, and the trains feature updates such as single-arm pantographs (similar to those used on ITX-Saemaeul trains and KTX trains), CCTV cameras, and a third headlight in the same compartment as the destination sign and the run number indicator, giving the trains the nickname \\"ÏÇºÎààÏù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"3 eyes\\"). The fourth generation trains are numbered 351-73~351-78. = 5th generation = The fifth generation of Class 351000 trains will be built by Hyundai Rotem starting in 2021 likely to replace the aging first generation trains, which are nearing the end of their service lifespans. The trains sport some minor changes, such as the change in the propulsion system (from an IGBT-based system to an interior permanent magnet- based system). The cab ends of the driving cars changed completely; as a result, railfans nicknamed the trains \\"Ï£ºÎë•Ïù¥\\" (roughly translated as \\"snout face\\"). The trains will be delivered in the new livery. At this time, 18 trains are expected to be delivered before 2023.https://v.kakao.com/v/20191219110613029  Refurbishment  The first and second generation Class 351000 trains were overhauled from 2003 to 2005 (though minor refurbishments were started in 2002). Major and minor refurbishments are listed below. = Overhaul = The Daegu subway fire compelled Korail to introduce flame-resistant interiors for passenger safety. As a result, all first and second generation trains were overhauled with fire- retardant interiors from 2003 to 2005. All third and fourth generation trains were delivered to be fire-retardant from the beginning. = New livery = Refurbished interior of a first batch train All first and second generation trains featured a livery consisting of red and orange stripes. These trains were repainted into a two-tone blue and yellow livery from 2003 to 2005. The new livery has a metaphor of Taegeuk, but was criticized as being too primitive-looking. The livery is applied only on front and on the doors. Until 2017, trains 351-61~351-72 used a two-tone red and blue livery, the same livery used on Line 1 and Gyeongui-Jungang Line trains. = Electric parts = * 2002: Trains 351-01~351-22 were retrofitted with Comonet broadcasting systems. They have since been removed. * 2003: All 1st generation trains except trains 351-09, 351-11~351-12, 351-14, 351-17~351-18, and 351-20~351-22 had their GTO inverters replaced with IGBT inverters. * 2004: All trains' braking systems are refurbished to generate less noise. * 2004-2005: SIV traction systems were replaced with IGBT traction systems built by Woojin Industrial Systems. * 2005: Various new components in all trains (public address systems, newer cooling systems, and LED destination signs) are added. From July 2008, all 1st and 2nd generation trains were retrofitted with automatic gangway doors (similar retrofits were also done in Class 311000, Class 321000, and Class 341000 trains). This retrofit included the installation of automatic doors to replace the older doors that were manually pulled open; gangway doors can now be automatically opened by the push of a button. This retrofit process was completed by February 2012. All trains that were delivered with incandescent headlights are now being retrofitted with LED headlights, following the successful testing of LED headlights on the Korail Class 311000 cars. = Renumbering = In 2011, the 1st and 2nd generation Class 351000 trains were renumbered from the 2030-series to the 351000-series as a part of a new numbering scheme by Korail (the leading \\"3\\" indicating a metro car).

History Ecuador and India established diplomatic relations in 1969. Ecuador first opened its embassy in New Delhi in 1973, but closed it in 1977. The embassy operated again between 1984‚Äì85, before opening again in February 2005, and a consulate general in Mumbai in 2013. The repeated opening and closure of the embassy was because of the expense incurred by Ecuador to maintain an embassy. India's embassy in Bogot√°, Colombia is jointly accredited to Ecuador. The two countries signed an MoU on holding regular foreign consultations in 2000. The first Foreign Consultation was held in 2005, followed by 2008, 2011 and 2014\\\\. Several ministerial level visits between the two countries have taken place. Several Ecuadorean Foreign Ministers and other dignitaries have visited India. From India, the highest level visits to Ecuador have been at the level of minister of state. The two countries have signed several bilateral agreements on co-operation in the fields of education (2006), agriculture (2008), and economic co-operation (2013). India and Ecuador signed a Protocol on Joint Economic and Trade Committee (JETCO) in October 2015 in New Delhi. Trade Bilateral trade between Ecuador and India rose from US$98.9 million in 2009 to $1.29 billion in 2014‚Äì15. Bilateral trade declined to $553.14 million in 2015‚Äì16. India exported $415.45 million worth of goods to Ecuador, and imported $137.69 million in 2015‚Äì16. The main commodities exported by Ecuador to India are mineral fuels/oils, wood and wood articles, cocoa and cocoa preparations, aluminum and related articles, machinery and mechanical appliances, lead, copper, zinc and articles thereof, and miscellaneous manufactured articles. The major commodities imported by Ecuador from India are mineral fuels/oils, iron and steel, pharmaceutical products, vehicles, organic chemicals, plastics and related articles, machinery and mechanical appliances, electrical machinery and equipment, rubber and articles. On 16 November 2008, the Foreign Minister of Ecuador Maria Isabel Salvador met her counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee, and discussed co-operation in oil and defence. The new government in Ecuador reversed the earlier revenue-sharing arrangements with western oil companies and was keen to start a new partnership with state-owned ONGC Videsh. An MoU was signed between two state-owned oil companies ONGC Videsh and Petroecuador, and another between the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and the Export and Investment Promotion Council of Ecuador (CORPEI) in 2006. Defence Ecuador was the first country to purchase Dhruv helicopters, of which one was for use by its president. The Government of Ecuador signed an agreement with HAL to purchase 7 Dhruv helicopters at a total cost of $45.2 million in November 2008. HAL delivered the 7 helicopters to Ecuador between 2009 and 2012. On 11 October 2015, Ecuador stated that it was grounding the fleet, after four of the seven helicopter crashed in separate incidents. The Ecuador Government stated that two helicopters crashed due to pilot error, while the other two were the result of mechanical failures. The Government also accused HAL of failing to ship some spare parts for the helicopters. HAL defend its helicopters stating that over 200 Dhruv helicopters were in service with the Indian military and operating without incident. The company blamed Ecuador's operation of the helicopters for the crashes, and also added that the 24-month warranty period of after-sales service support for the helicopters had already expired. HAL also offered to send a team to Ecuador to resolve any outstanding issues. Ecuador put its three remaining helicopters up for sale in 2016. Ecuadorian Vice Chief, General Rodrigo Bohorquez, attended Aero India in February 2007 and Brigadier General Ra√∫l Banderas Due√±as attended the Defence Expo in February 2010. Ecuador and India signed an MoU on defence co-operation in 2011. The Government of Ecuador maintains a Defence Attach√© in its embassy in New Delhi. The Defence Attach√© at the Embassy of India in Santiago, Chile is jointly accredited to Ecuador. Cultural relations Ecuador and India signed an MoU on cultural co-operation in 2006, and a cultural exchange programme between the two countries was held from 2009 to 2011. As of December 2016, about 350 Indian nationals reside in Ecuador, the majority of whom are employed in the service sector and in small businesses. Foreign aid India and Ecuador agreed to set up a Centre for Excellence in Information Technology in August 2009. The Centre, located at Northern Technical University (UTN) in Ibarra, was opened in 2015. India donated medicines worth $1 million in 2008 and 2010 at the request of Ecuador. India donated 15 tons of medicines to Ecuador in the aftermath of an earthquake on 16 April 2016. Citizens of Ecuador are eligible for scholarships under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.

Her dissertation, on approximation algorithms, was supervised by Seffi Naor. She has been at the Toyota Technological Institute since 2007, and also holds a position in the Computer Science Department of the University of Chicago. Contributions and recognition Chuzhoy won the best paper award at the 2012 Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science for her paper with Shi Li on approximating the problem of connecting many given pairs of vertices in a graph by edge-disjoint paths. She is also known for her work showing a polynomial relation between the size of a grid graph minor of a graph and its treewidth. This connection between these two graph properties is a key component of the Robertson‚ÄìSeymour theorem, is closely related to Halin's grid theorem for infinite graphs, and underlies the theory of bidimensionality for graph approximation algorithms.

For example, before the Great Depression in the US many people thought that it is cognitively adequate to think of getting rich quickly through land speculation.

The IEQJ was based in Paris at 21 rue La Bo√©tie in a building belonging to art dealer Paul Rosenberg, who was owner of a major art gallery in Paris that had been requisitioned by the Nazis. As a private organization under direct control of the German authority, the IEQJ had no formal link with the Vichy regime. Its main role was the spreading of anti-Semitic propaganda and the publication of the magazine ' directed by Andr√© Chaumet which published 13 issues between November 1941 and February 1943. This was followed by a second magazine entitled Revivre (with the subtitle \\"The great illustrated magazine about race\\") published from March 1943 to July 20, 1944, this time in direct connection with Vichy, and this, too, directed by Chaumet. The IEQJ also published La Question juive en France (\\"The Jewish Question in France\\").

Life His father was Henry Radcliffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex, and his mother was Henry's second wife Anne Calthorpe. When a young man he took part in the Rising of the North of 1569, an attempt by Catholic nobles to depose Queen Elizabeth I. He was so active that special instructions were given for his capture on its suppression. He managed, however, to escape over the Scottish border, and was for some time, with other rebels, the guest of the Scotts of Buccleuch. A ship was provided to convey the party to Flanders, but news of the efforts the English government were making to intercept them having reached them, they seem to have sailed by way of Orkney. Once at Antwerp, Radcliffe received a pension of eight hundred ducats from the King of Spain. The diplomat Thomas Randolph heard in April 1571 that he had shot and killed an English merchant in Antwerp who refused to lend him money.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1569-1571, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1903), p. 527. In the early part of 1572 he went on a mission to Madrid, where he was imprisoned for debt at the end of 1573; in 1574, having returned to the Low Countries, he went to France, and quit \\"the King of Spain's entertainment\\". He wrote many letters to Queen Elizabeth's adviser William Cecil and others about his pardon, and in February 1574‚Äì5 Thomas Wilson, writing to Cecil, spoke of him as \\"marvellously repentant\\"; he offered to serve in Ireland, and later in the same year he sent a letter to Wilson \\"full of submission, with great moan of his necessity\\". He moved in 1575 to Calais. Radcliffe came in November 1575 to London; but when he showed himself at court he was sent to the Tower of London. About April 1577 he made petition to be allowed to take exercise in the little garden facing his prison, and to have a servant. He was confined in the Beauchamp Tower, where he cut his name, with the date 1576 and the motto \\"pour parvenir\\", in the wall of one of the cells. On 10 May 1578 he was secretly released from prison, and exiled. He went to Flanders; here he incurred suspicion of being mixed up in a plot to poison Don John of Austria, presumably as the agent of the English government, and was consequently beheaded in the market-place of Namur. Bernardino de Mendoza, the Spanish ambassador in England, describes him as \\"a rash and daring young man, ready for anything\\". Radcliffe was author of Politique Discourses translated out of French (London, 1578), dedicated to Sir Francis Walsingham, written while in the Beauchamp Tower.

History The name Hawsker derives from Old Norse and means Haukr's enclosure. The settlement was listed in the Domesday Book as belonging to Earl Hugh in Nortreding. Hawsker was originally in the parish of Whitby, but in 1878 it was split off into its own parish (Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre) along with neighbouring hamlet of Stainsacre where the parish church of All Saints is located. the population of the parish is 790 and includes the hamlet of Stainsacre and the wider parish which amounts to over in area. The two settlements of High and Low Hawsker are divided by the A171 road between Whitby and Scarborough; Low Hawsker lies to the west of the road and High Hawsker lies to the east. Low Hawsker used to have a working windmill; this was built in 1861 by George Burnett and was known to be in use up until 1915. The upper storeys were removed in 1960, but the lower portion is still in the village. Between July 1885 and March 1965, Hawsker had a station on the Scarborough & Whitby Railway line. The track was left in situ for potash traffic that never was realised, however, a new potash mine at Sneatonthorpe (to the west) is due to open for mining in 2021. The trackbed is now a long distance path and cycleway, with the old station now housing a cycle hire business. There is a primary school in the village that caters for students from the Hawsker-cum-Stainsacre parish and was rated as being 'Good' by Ofsted in 2013. Caedmon College and Eskdale School, both in Whitby, provide secondary education for students from Hawsker and Stainsacre.

Characters =Twin Star Exorcists= The are a couple of exorcists destined to be the parents of the \\"Miko\\", the reincarnation of Abe no Seimei and the ultimate exorcist that is said to be capable of cleansing every kind of evil spirit. The Twin Star Exorcists also have a special, exclusive ability called \\"Resonance\\", that allows them to combine their forces to increase the power of their attacks or access abilities that no other exorcist possess. It is also revealed that the Twin Stars are not proper exorcists, but rather \\"Vessels\\" made by Abe no Semei and Ashiya Doman. They do not have guardian spirits, but rather their powers come from the entire world around them. The Male Twin star , made by Semei, (in this case, Rokuro) is a vessel for the Yang energy and the Female Twin Star , made by Doman, (in this case, Benio) is a vessel for the Yin energy. Both energies normally act as polar opposites to each other, but it is only through a fusion of both powers that the Miko is born, who is not a reincarnation of any spirit, but rather an embodiment of the two powers in one form. ; : :The main protagonist. A brash and headstrong 14-year old exorcist who once motivated to be the strongest and cleanse all Kegare and sins. Rokuro was found by Seigen in Magano when he was 6 and had no memory of his past, after which Ryougo took him in. However, Yuuto Ijika caused a tragedy at the Hiinatsuki Dormitory which forced Rokuro in taking the lives of his friends who had been forcibly corrupted. Following this, his right arm was corrupted as well and became part Impurity with great offensive power. This tragedy made him nearly abandon exorcism until he met Benio, who inspires him to fight as an exorcist again. Despite not liking the idea of being her groom at first, he later develops feelings for her. During the time skip, Rokuro elevates in his studies and training, making him popular in high school. Rokuro becomes head of the former Adashino House on Tsuchimikado Island. In the climax of Kegare escaping into reality, Rokuro and Benio are rejoined after a long separation. Benio's fate as an Impurity doesn't change Rokuro's feelings for her. The pair live peacefully on the island in the process of four years. Rokuro soon obtains a fragment of Yuto's yang energy that slightly awakens his own transformation. After persuading the islanders to make an exception of Benio's misconduct, she and Rokuro officially get married. In the manga, it is eventually revealed that the Twin stars are not truly human, and Rokuro is a vessel for Yang energy. He was created by Abe no Seimei, in other words her son, so it appears as though his Guardian Spirit is Seimei, but in reality neither him nor Benio has a Guardian spirit. In the anime, he is actually the Hajo-√≥ (Cataclysm King or Star Destroyer King), an extremely powerful Impurity created by Abe no Seimei who is destined to wipe out humanity should they become a threat to the world. ; : :The main heroine. A serious, 14-year old girl, she vowed to become the strongest exorcist and destroy all Kegare in order to avenge her parents' death, who died protecting her. She wears a fox mask during battle. Upon meeting Rokuro she inspired him to return to being an exorcist, and despite not agreeing with the idea of becoming his bride, she secretly admires him for his tenacity, claiming that it is his sole redeeming quality. Benio has a taste for Ohagi. She admired her brother Yuuto until she learns his true colors. She loses both of her legs in the battle against Yuuto, but in the process, gets Impurity legs as replacements from Kamui (like Rokuro's arm) increasing her speed abilities to fight beside Rokuro. After the time skip, both seem to have become even closer with Benio silently noting that she has fallen in love with him. When receiving Sayo's enchantment, Benio's guardian appears to be of a dark entity that rivals with the Basara Impurity and is revealed by Kuzunoha to be Ashiya Doman, Abe no Seimei's archrival. She later loses her ability to exorcise and decides to stay while Rokuro leaves to Tsuchimikado Island ahead of her, but before that, she confirms her love for him and kisses him for the first time. She later learns from Chinu, the first impurity, that she has not actually lost her powers, but is awakening her real powers instead; the powers of Yin, as Benio is not a human, but an Impurity in a human's skin. Experiencing the oppression of past Lunas and noticing a weren't beside them, Benio unlocks her Impurity transformation and rejoins Rokuro just in time for their rematch against Yuuto. After the second time skip, Benio, gains an eyepatch similar to Yuto's. Benio's secret is eventually expose and place in custody. Rokuro busted her out and convinces the exorcist community to trust Benio again and accept their marriage. =Seika Dormitory= ; : :Rokuro's friend and fellow exorcist, who often acts as a surrogate big brother.

Second only to Arima Tsuchimikado among the exorcists in power, each use one of the twelve familiars of Abe no Seimei and inherit a portion of his power through their use of his familiars. The twelve families that they come from are descended from the twelve original companions of Abe no Seimei.

After recovering, Mayura dedicates herself to follow Rokuro's path as a useful exorcist and requests Seigen to train her for the next two years. Initially timid with herself, she acquires Seigen's charm, Byakko, and soon takes her father's place as head of the Amakawa House and one of the Heavenly Commanders. She has feelings for Rokuro and feels envious of Benio's relationship to Rokuro and her strength at first, but later becomes her closest friend, deciding to support her relationship with him instead. Mayura may have a romantic interest in Shimon, as shown while she comforted Shimon for his permanent injury. She forms a partnership with Shimon. In the video game, Mayura is one of the Twin Star candidates along Benio and three other new characters. ; : :Considered a child prodigy who despite only being 2 years older than Rokuro has attained the rank of Heavenly Commander, holding the title \\"Suzaku\\". Shimon is also Seigen's former student. He possesses the ability of flight and hates vehicles. His goal is to end the 1000-year war and break Sayo's heavy burden to let her live a long and free life. While he initially looked down on Rokuro and co, after they saved Sayo from two Basaras, he sees them in a new light and with a new respect and states that he looks forward to the day they will fight together. Shimon aims to surpass Tenma, due to their childhood rivalry. When Tenma used a prohibited enchantment that severed Shimon's leg during the Exorcist Games, he thought his days as a exorcist are done. Fortunately he gained a prosthesis replacement and proven Tenma that fate is not set in stone. ; : :She is a exorcist, holding the title \\"Tenk≈ç\\", who is Benio's former master.

He is childhood friends with Kankurou. ; :Narumi Ioroi's second daughter who inherits the title of \\"K≈çchin\\" after his death, Shizuru aims to be the strongest of all female exorcists. She has a tomboyish personality and initially disregards exorcists from the mainland though her opinion changes after Rokuro saves her, developing a crush on him since then. She had received a scar on her face that might have imbued her with Yin energy. ; : :Cordelia is an exorcist equipped with mechanical devices. Her suited title is \\"Tenk≈´\\". Most of the time she shows no facial expression and speaks in a robotic voice by spelling her words out which do not come from her mouth. ; : :He is labeled as the strongest among the Heavenly Commanders, he can slice his enemies with his sword and bring total annihilation in its surroundings without any use of talisman enhancements. His title is \\"Kijin,\\" that contains the source of deceased female Twin Stars. In the manga, they state that his latent power is so high, that he may not even know how to use talismans because they are useless to him. For generations, selected candidates of the Unomiya House are force kill one another during a remote dark ritual till the last standing will be Heavenly Commander, the latest being Tenma who endured the sorrow of his brethren. An oracle and the death of his sister cursed the world around him making Tenma incomprehensible. In the major battle against Yuuto, Tenma's heritage allows him and Rokuro to perform Resonance. Yuuto's sudden Unchain evolution takes them by surprise and then Tenma blocks the attack for Rokuro and lost several of his limbs and barely survives in the end. Former Members ; : :Mayura's divorced father who was the former master of Rokuro and Yuuto, he left his family as he did not wish for his duties to interfere with their lives. He displays a cold exterior yet caring. Seigen renounces his status as a Heavenly Commander due from losing his right arm to his traitorous student Yuuto. Despite the loss of his arm, he is not heavily impeded while fighting regular Kegare and still dominates Rokuro in sparring matches. When Mayura's skills is approved Seigen passes over his \\"Byakko\\" the White Tiger title to her. ; : :He is a muscular exorcist who has faith in strength that cannot be left unused. His title is \\"K≈çchin\\". His earth elements allow him to uproar structures made out of the environment to attack his enemies. He has a short-standard wife and nine children. His schoolmates, Arima, Arata, and Seigen made a formidable quest for leading a squad of fifty against Chikura, the previous eighth nurse-like Basara, that posed a centuries old threat. He is mortally wounded in a battle against Gabura and has Shizuru inherit his title before passing away. ; : :Miku is an exorcist with long, pink, curly hair. She expresses strict responsibility as a Heavenly Commander, and execute missions in cleansing all Kegare regardless of any unusual situation. Her title is \\"Daion\\". She is older than she looks, stated by Tenma to be 56. Her enchantment is based on plush dolls. In the anime, she was paired with Sakura's father (for whom she had feelings as well) long before she was born. When she discovered Sakura's father was to be married, she accepted the fact sadly without complaint. In a dreadful battle in Magano, Miku used her last remaining strength on saving Sakura and Ioroi's squad from an unbeatable Basara. =Antagonist= ; : :The main antagonist of the series. Yuuto is Benio's twin brother and an old friend turned enemy of Rokuro who supposedly died two years ago at the Hiinatsuki Dormitory. The truth is Yuuto had been using the cadets as experimental subjects, including Rokuro, the only successful subject, being forced to kill them, an event therefore known as the \\"Hiinatsuki Tragedy\\", that inflicted such a trauma on Rokuro that he decided to quit exorcism until he met Benio. Yuuto's objective is to become the ultimate exorcist by attaining the complete power of yang (the spiritual powers of humanity) and yin (the spiritual powers of the Kegare); which would result in eradicating all life in existence. Upon learning his plans, Rokuro and Benio started to focus on their training with the main purpose of defeating him as Rokuro wants to avenge his dead friends, and Benio intends to defeat her brother as a sign of atonement for the sake of her family's honor. His entire body had direct contact with a Fallen Impurity; transforming into one in the battle with Rokuro and Benio. In the anime, Yuuto was born with an unnecessary existence and acts as an guidance for Rokuro, so that one of them can become the King of Impurities, and sees Benio as an inferior to his only means of living due to her engagement with Rokuro. In the manga, Yuuto was aspired to protect his family in his youth, until an accident caused him to fall comatose for half a year. Due to being a Twin Star's sibling, Yuuto experienced visions of the catastrophe prophecy of exorcists and mankind, thus rendering his personality to mental disorder and guilty conscience. A dying Yuuto could be heard singing a song from his childhood. =Basara= The Basara are the most powerful Impurities in existence with each gaining intelligence, speech, and a human-like body by absorbing the energy of the exorcists they killed. Like exorcists, they can use their own version of enchanted gear and talismans to strengthen their powers. Unlike regular Impurities, their bodies do not disappear once they are killed. In the manga, there are a total of 11 in existence while several 7 original Basara were created exclusive for the anime series. ; :The first and oldest of the eleven Basara. She is labeled as \\"most powerful\\" though inexplicably has low enchantments and shares a striking resemblances to Abe no Seimei. Chinu's actually a prototype Impurity long experimented in Ashiya Doman's research to countermeasure the King of Impurities. Unlike other Basara, she takes keen interest in human society. Meeting Benio in person, like many previous female Twin stars, Chinu offered her dormant powers to be awakened at the cost of her humanity. ; :The second and the de facto leader of the eleven Basara. His role in the manga is same as Kuranashi in the anime. Unlike Chinu, Sakanashi has no qualms killing humans or impurities for power. Not only his \\"Pitch Black Puppet\\" enchantment allows him to engulf the boundaries of physics; Sakanashi's final white form called \\"Unchain\\" can effortlessly match a Head Exorcist. He misled the Basaras into cooperating with him. By the end of the exorcist games, Sakanashi implements his diabolic plan to keep the Heavenly Commanders at bay, luring Arima onto the battlefield to kill him otherwise, and releasing a herd of Impurities through the gateway and into Tsuchimikado Island to lead humanity to oblivion. He is destroyed by a suicide attack from Arima. His death led the Yang embodiment that he confined a millennium ago to being set free and seeks out its vessel, Rokuro, to devour and forcibly his awakening. ; :The third of the eleven Basara. His risk level is SS. In the manga, he is the one responsible for the death of Tsubaki Sada, Sakura's father. Strangely, he slightly resembles Tsubaki, having similar hairstyles. Gabura is playful in killing humans as like some sport. He uses instant shock wave enchantments, similar to Rokuro's gold smash, shown while targeting the Ioroi squad. Sakura and Miku arrived with reinforcements to focus all fire on Gabura for the long-waited battle. However, Gabura proved to be too much of a challenge, and so Sakura and Shizuru opened a portal to transport him to a far distance location, while a dying Miku used her last remaining energy to mighty push Gabura in it. ; :The fourth of the eleven Basara. Hijirimaru enjoys toying with humans and has absolutely no pity for them. He enjoys killing his opponents to awake the rage and hatred of their loved one, in order to gain more power after killing them too. He and Higano kidnap Sayo into Magano in order to feed on her spiritual power but is stopped by Shimon, Rokuro, Benio and Mayura. After absorbing Higano's enchanted powers in order to get stronger, Hijirimaru is destroyed by the Twin Star Exorcists' combined power. He is revealed to be motivated to obtain enough power to let Higano and himself watch the sky on Earth without the risk of being turned to dust by Earth's yang energy. ; :The fifth of the eleven Basara. He wears a magician's outfit and hat. He summons impurities the size of fortresses to ambush Rokuro's squad with the determination of avenging Hijirimaru, his former partner. Shiromi is returning the flavor by taking hostages that are close to Rokuro. Rokuro escapes from a Impurity devouring him, and his squad set up a distraction to surprise Shiromi, while Rokuro hits him hard. Despite this, a still standing Shiromi impales Rokuro and his team, that leaves a repeated disaster image of his peers from the Hinatsuki Dormitory to his eyes. Before Rokuro could muster an unprepared power to fight back, Arima emerges and saves the team. Shiromi then died realizing Sakanashi may have been using him. ; :The sixth of the eleven Basara. Kaguya is a foul mouthed and mentally unstable impurity. She wears a lieutenant uniform and using a whip, obsessive about her \\"darling,\\" which is a male exorcist-turned zombie. Her enchantments are base on water elements, to which she can transform into a full body liquid. The source of her hatred to all human and Impurity comes from her past relationship with a human lover once believing that hope for love is real, until she was betrayed and discriminated. Kaguya rages further knowing the fact that Benio, who is now a Impurity could actually be allowed see a human (Rokuro), and witnessing Kaguya's darling's corpse get smashed. In her retaliation, Kaguya completely alters her body into effective water substance to drown Kamui and Benio, only to fail, and Kaguya's body then vaporized leading to her death. ; :The seventh of the eleven Basara. He has a scarred left eye and controls yang energy to create magnetic fields. Subaru and Gaja seem to have a history with each other. Despite being an formidable foe, Gaja doesn't have real fighting spirit. ; :The eighth of the eleven Basara. Shioji wears a girlish custom-made private school uniform and narrates his speech. He specializes in reanimating former exorcists from the dead and enforce them to fight other fellow brethren. The realization of Sakanashi's delude doesn't sway Shioji's strategy, as he exasperatingly resumes annihilate many exorcists he could. Until then Tatara ambushes Shioji and impales him through the chest. With his last thoughts in mind, he deeply wishes for rebirth but not as a mere impurity. ; :The ninth of the eleven Basara, he has followed Hijimaru since the later found him as an ordinary juvenile Impurity. Unlike his partner, he is calm and collected and is not interested in obtaining more enchanted powers for himself. On the other hand, Higano is highly dedicated to the latter and his dream, up to the point of sacrificing himself to take a mortal attack for him and transferring his enchanted powers to Hijimaru to make him stronger. ; :The tenth of the eleven Basara. She wears a bunny outfit with great sensing abilities to spell power. Having to be a masochist, Yuzuriha has no qualms posing as bait to progress Sakanashi's plan to direct Impurities out to the real world. She is last seen carrying Sakanashi's disfigure head. ; : :The youngest and eleventh of the eleven Basara. He is also responsible for the death of Benio's parents. Though, he tends to let his opponents choose the death of their preference, and always gives them ten seconds to decide. He seeks entertainment by fighting humans without caring about which side (Human or Impurity) will be destroyed, and loves humans because they are weak yet strive to grow stronger. Despite knowing of Benio's hatred towards him, he usually appears to help her, hoping to fight her once she becomes a worthy opponent. Kamui seems on good terms with Chinu. Over the course of the series Kamui's interest in Benio grows until he comes to care for her unconditionally without realizing it. When Kaguya severely wounded him, Kamui questioned if he should die for his crimes but Benio encouraged him not to throw his life away. He awakened his ultimate white form (Unchain) to protect Benio from Kaguya. He waits the day to willingly fight the Twin Stars, and is implied to have stopped killing humans due to Benio's influence. =Other characters= ; : :The leader of all exorcists in Japan, and the one who arranges the marriage between Benio and Rokuro. He later relocates them to a fancy villa. While eccentric and comedic, he also possesses an enigmatic, devious, and even sinister side. His greatest enchantment is summoning the Avalokite≈õvara. On the other hand, he is also powerful enough that two of the Heavenly Commanders declined to join him on the battlefield as they would be merely a hindrance to him. Sometimes he appear uncaring in the case of the Twin Stars, when they are in danger, although in fact he wants them to prove themselves worthy of their title and strengthen their powers and bonds together unlike the previous couples that were chosen to become the Twin Stars, who died due to their carelessness. In the manga, in his battle against Sakanashi, Arima executes his Fallen Impurity transformation as a last resort, sacrificing himself to defeat the Basara. ; : :Benio's familiar who is very protective of her. He has the ability to possess vehicles and machines to assist the Twin Stars in their missions. While he appears since the beginning in the anime series, Kinako only appears in the manga when Rokuro takes ownership of Benio's house, which was abandoned after her clan was disbanded following her parents' deaths and Yuuto's betrayal, guarded by him since then. ; :Mayura's mother and the ex- wife of Seigen Amawaka. She is a biologist on the mainland. ; :She is Shimon's younger cousin addressed as his little sister. He nicknames her \\"Chiiko\\". Despite being 11-years old she is the heir and Proctor of the Ikaruga House. Sayo is the host of the guardian Kuzunoha that allows her to bestow a ceremony of divination on exorcists to see their quality essence. However, harboring such a strong guardian spirit greatly shortens her lifespan to less than two decades. Spending her entire life on the closed-off island, she gains the wonderful opportunity to visit the mainland upon Rokuro's request to be tested rather he'll be chosen worthy, making Sayo fall for him and considers him her prince and was clingy towards him whenever she's near him and managed to make Benio appear envious towards Sayo in her own way. Four years later, Sayo trained to harness Kuzunoha's powers and participate in exorcising impurities. Once learnt of Rokuro's proposal to Benio, she hastily challenges Benio on a mission in Magano in doing so to get Sayo's approval. ; :The unreliable son of Arima. He only makes his debut, when Rokuro enrolls at Seiyouin Exorcist Academy on Tsuchimikado Island. Arima is initially acknowledged by all lower clansmen, until he decides to resign in living in the Enmado's house after Rokuro taken over its property as a branch member. Prideful of wanting loyalty from his father, Arimori swore his allegiance to Rokuro instead. Arimori tricked several young exorcists in signing for Enmado House, who thought it would be the Tsuchimikado House, regardless of the deception the members serve affiliation and companionship to Rokuro and Arimori. He and Kinako cheered for Rokuro's victory in the Exorcist Games. In the battle between Sakanashi and Arima, Arimori finally earns his father's acceptance. Following Arima's death, Arimori is brought back to the Tsuchimikado House as the next Head Exorcist- in-training. ; : :A young girl in anime-only. She is intelligent and very enthusiastic towards Rokuro and Benio. Similar to Rokuro, Sae is found in Magano with no memory. Rokuro and the others bring her to Seika Dormitory. She travels with the Twin Stars on the pursuit to exterminate the Dragon Spot outburst. Its proven that Sae possesses strong abilities she could deflect Basara's attacks. Eventually it is revealed that Sae came from a branch broken off from the Ame-no-mihashira, a gigantic tree barrier that separates Magano and the real world, and attained human form just like a tsukumogami, upsetting the balance between both realms, which is only restored when she returns to her former self, much to Rokuro and Benio's grief. She refers to Rokuro as \\"Papa\\", possibly due to his connection with Abe no Seimei. ; : :An anime-only member of the Tsuchimikado family. He serves Arima, as his right-hand man, and after Arima's disappearance, he serves as the Stand-in for Head Exorcist. Unlike Arima, he is mostly silent, speaking only when needed. It is later revealed that Mikage is actually Abe no Seimei's Shikigami, created to watch his plan go into account, that the world will be rid of impurities. ; : :A Basara with a moral colorful personality and hobby for metal rock and role playing. Suzu is an unnatural Basara who spawned without the use of absorbing spiritual energy from other exorcists. She prefers to fight her opponents in battle dancing performances, although she despises those who are cowards. Her music affects low spiritual users thus rendering them to mutation. She has an interest in Rokuro (who is her first time meeting a human). While she first appeared as an anime original character, Suzu officially appears in the manga as of chapter 76. Anime Original ; : :He is a mysterious Basara and is very powerful. He is always seen wearing a mask, which seems to hold a portion of his power. He is the main perpetrator who achieved in tampering the Ame-no- mihashira to access the Dragon Spots across the country pretending it's a game, in order to lure the Heavenly Commanders in a trap to extract their spiritual energy for ultimate strength. Having lived for hundreds of years as a Basara, Kuranashi has evolved long enough to display features almost human- like. His consciousness is overtaken by Yuuto when he attempts to absorb Yuuto's body, marking that Kuranashi was merely a pawn, as Yuuto all along been waiting for him to do so in order to take his stolen powers. ; : :A Basara and Kuranashi's loyal servant. Moro can generate enchantments into her muscles from an armor. She is responsible for the death of Sakura's father twenty-years prior, until she finally faces justice against Sakura herself and Miku. ; :A flashy Basara that declares superiority. He adores gigantic shape Kegare that are helpful in combat. He is later defeated by the hands of Kankuro and Kengo. ; : :A powerful butler-like Basara that the Twin Stars were helpless to defeat, who precisely shoots them his musket, until Tenma steps in and singlehandedly cleanses him in half. ; : :They are the only Basara Twins. Chijiwa always wears a black suit, while Momochi wears white. Following Momochi's defeat, Chijiwa swears revenge against the Twin Stars (unaware that Kuranashi seppuku Momochi for seeing him useless and gave Chijiwa his brother's spiritual energy) but fails after being defeated by Shimon and Rokuro. ; : :A lion faced True Serpent (a Kegare on the verge of becoming a Basara) who came from Magano to Human World through a Dragon spot to just see something beautiful. He became friend with Sae but later killed by an unhesitant Sakura and Miku. =Video game-only characters= ;Ran Ikuno : :The youngest of the Twin Star candidates in the game, she is an innocent, airhead \\"little sister\\" type character with no real desire to be an exorcist. ;Rimu Tenn≈çji : :Another of the Twin Star candidates in the game, she is a tomboy who lost part of her memory. ;Ai Katsuj≈ç : :The third of the original Twin Star candidates in the game.

Since 2009, she has been a key player in Australian Jewish media. Her activism utilises multimedia tools, focusing on social justice, good epistemic practice in biomedical research and policy development, transparency, Orthodox Judaism and feminism. New media activism Fein was an early adopter of various online channels in organising for social justice. Her blog, The Sensible Jew, was at the forefront of a campaign against homophobia in Australia's Jewish community, and she has since been an outspoken proponent of LGBTQI inclusion in organised Jewish communal life. In 2013, she took over the editorship of online Jewish affairs magazine, Galus Australis. Here and elsewhere, Fein campaigned against the culture of cover up that emerged from the Royal Commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Fein contended that there was a rabbinic culture inimical to transparency and the rule of law. Fein was also responsible for 'outing' federal politician, Michael Danby, who in the 2013 Federal Elections produced separate 'how to vote' cards which Fein contended pandered to ultra- Orthodox prejudices. Feminism and Orthodox Judaism The worldwide push to redress systemic discrimination against women in Orthodox Judaism became central to Fein's activism after her marriage to an Orthodox Rabbi in 2011. A long time feminist, she is an advocate of a systems approach to the religious community's pathologies, identifying the ultra-Orthodox hegemony over the rabbinate and their attitudes towards sex and sexuality as common factors linking such issues as homophobia, the cover up of sexual abuse, and violence against women (including igun/gett refusal). She contends that there is space within authentic Orthodoxy for reconciling feminism and the rights of the individual. She is a firm believer in the need for Orthodox women to have the skills and capacities to lead their congregations. Interfaith work In 2015 Fein, together with Bracha Rafael established an interfaith publication called, The Colony. It formed a launchpad for Fein's activism against Islamophobia. Macroscope Fein founded Macroscope, a communications and product development company specialising in biomedical research counter- disinformation. Judy Wilyman incident Following The University of Wollongong's conferring a PhD on Judy Wilyman for a thesis propagating anti- vaccination misinformation, Fein opened a change.org petition calling on the Department of Education and Training to take disciplinary action against the university. The petition was unsuccessful.http://archive.is/uKsyL Controversies Fein has strongly condemned what she perceives as a corrupted organisational and philanthropic culture in Jewish Australia. Her own philanthropic activity has been unconventional, and her opposition to establishment practices has been criticised as simplistic and naive.

In the field of physics, he is best known for his work on gas discharges and plasma physics, as well as his collaborations with Denisa Popescu in laser spectroscopy. He also had pioneering contributions in the field of gamma-ray lasers with Carl B. Collins and Silviu Olariu. As of 2006, the focus of Iovitzu Popescu's work has shifted towards the field of linguistics, in cooperation with leading linguist Gabriel Altmann.  Early life  Iovitzu Popescu was born in Burila Mare village, Mehedin»õi County. He is the son of Dumitru Popescu and Elvira (n√©e Iovitz). In 1951 he graduated from Traian High School in Turnu Severin. Between 1951 and 1955 he was a student at University of Bucharest, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, from which he graduated in 1955 with the thesis \\"Sodium-Vapor Lamp\\", supervised by Radu Grigorovici.  Career  In 1955, following graduation, Iovitzu Popescu was offered a position at the University of Bucharest by Eugen BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, in the Department of Optics and Gas Discharges, which he accepted. In 1961, he obtained his Ph.D. on a thesis entitled \\"The mechanism of cathodic parts of glow discharges\\", under BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu's supervision. Between 1960 and 1972 Iovitzu Popescu was head of the Plasma Physics Laboratory at the Institute of Physics, Bucharest. In 1969, he co-authored one of the first experimental studies on nano-clustering in high pressure gases. From 1967 to 1969 he was a Humboldt fellow at University of Kiel, Germany. He worked on atomic spectroscopy with Walter Lochte-Holtgreven and Johannes Richter. In 1970, he started his collaboration with Professor Carl B. Collins, head of the Center for Quantum Electronics at University of Texas, Dallas, on multiphoton spectroscopy and induced gamma emission. In 1974, they co-authored the first experimental report on multiphoton spectra. In 1972, Iovitzu Popescu became a tenured professor at University of Bucharest, Faculty of Physics. He was the Dean of the Faculty of Physics from 1972 to 1977. Between 1977 and 1981 he headed the newly founded Institute of Physics and Technology of Radiation Devices. In May 1981 Iovitzu Popescu became Rector of University of Bucharest, a position he held until October 1989. In 1990 he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy, having been a corresponding member for 16 years. He presided over the Physical Sciences Section of the Romanian Academy between 1990 and 1992. In 1982, Iovitzu Popescu wrote that the aether is \\"a form of existence of the matter, but it differs qualitatively from the common (atomic and molecular) substance or radiation (photons)\\". The fluid aether is \\"governed by the principle of inertia and its presence produces a modification of the space-time geometry\\". Built upon Le Sage's ultra-mundane corpuscles, Popescu's theory posits a finite Universe \\"filled with some particles of exceedingly small mass (of about 10‚àí69 kg), traveling chaotically at speed of light\\" and material bodies \\"made up of such particles called etherons\\". In recent years, the interest of Iovitzu Popescu has shifted to the field of quantitative linguistics, which has become one of his favorite leisure activities.  Personal life  Iovitzu Popescu was married to Denisa-Georgeta Popescu from 1963 until her death in 2003. Together they co-authored 35 papers on optogalvanic and laser spectroscopy.  Awards  The excellence of Iovitzu Popescu's work has been widely recognized: * 1961 - Physics Prize, awarded by the Ministry of National Education. * 1966 - \\"Constantin Miculescu\\" prize for Physics awarded by the Romanian Academy. * 1997 - Honorary Citizen of Mehedin≈£i County. * 1998 - Doctor Honoris Causa of the University of Craiova. * 2000 - Commander of the Order of Faithful Service awarded by the President of Romania. * 2002 - \\"Meritul Academic\\" diploma awarded by the Romanian Academy. * 2002 - \\"Diploma of Excellence\\" awarded by the Ministry of Education and Research. * 2009 - \\"Opera Omnia\\" prize for lifetime achievements in science awarded by CNCSIS. * 2009 - \\"Diploma of Excellence\\" of Drobeta-Turnu Severin City. * 2010 - \\"Medal of Honor\\" awarded by the Institute of Atomic Physics. * 2012 - \\"Grigore Moisil\\" award for exact sciences awarded by the National Grand Lodge of Romania. * 2012 - \\"Diploma of Excellence\\" awarded by the Ministry of Education and Research.  Bibliography  To date, the most cited peer-reviewed publication of Iovitzu Popescu remains his collaborative review, with Silviu Olariu, on the quantum effects of electromagnetic fluxes. Prof. Popescu's handwritten textbook on geometrical optics, first published in 1988, was recently translated into English and is freely available online. His most notable books and scientific publications are: * The quantum effects of electromagnetic fluxes * Accelerated emission of gamma rays from the 31-yr isomer of 178 Hf induced by X-Ray irradiation * Word frequency studies * The coherent and incoherent pumping of a gamma ray laser with intense optical radiation * Use of space-charge-amplification techniques in the absorption spectroscopy of Cs and Cs 2 * Multiphoton excitation and ionization of atomic cesium with a tunable dye laser * Œ≥ emission from the 31-yr isomer of 178 Hf induced by x-ray irradiation * Tunable synchrotron radiation used to induce Œ≥-emission from the 31 year isomer of 178Hf See also *Luminiferous aether *Aether theories  References   External links  * Iovitzu Popescu's web site * Ioan-Iovitz Popescu as seen by Dr. Gheorghe Dinescu * Iovitzu seen by Nicholas Ionescu-Pallas * Life and scientific works of Ioan-Iovitz Popescu at the 75 year anniversary * Ioan-Iovitz Popescu: Opera Omnia * On the symbiosis of physicists and linguists * Selected Books by Ioan-Iovitz Popescu * Radu Grigorovici * Eugen Badarau * The works and the school of Eugen Badareu * Journal Ranking and Average Impact Factors of Basic and Allied Sciences - Ioan-Iovitz Popescu * Science Journal Ranking by Average Impact Factors - Ioan-Iovitz Popescu * Finnegans Wake Seen from the Angle of Mathematics * Denisa & Iovitzu - Photo Album * Heralding Laser Spectroscopy - Dr. Denisa- Georgeta Popescu * Significant Isomer References - Center for Quantum Electronics, University of Texas at Dallas * Ioan-Iovitz Popescu - Ether and Etherons.

Pugasaing is played using thirteen counters of bone carved into various shapes (men, snakes, war clubs, fish and ducks), along with four circular brass counters. These are thrown from a bowl, and a score is derived from the way in which they fall, depending on which sides land uppermost. The best possible score is 158, which occurs when all the pieces land red-side up and one of the men lands upright on top of one of the brass counters. Pugasaing was often used for gambling, with players staking personal belongings, family members and their own servitude on the results of the throw. Some players became professional gamblers, travelling around the country and making their living from the game.

The first church was consecrated in 1908 and was dedicated to St Hugh of Lincoln while the modern church which replaced it was built in 1963. It comes under the Diocese of Westminster. The Original Church - 1907-1963 The original church of 1908, now 'Fortescue Hall' When Adrian Fortescue was appointed Missionary Rector of Letchworth in Hertfordshire in November 1907 he faced the task of building a church from scratch. Much of the original church he designed and paid for personally, and parish records show that he in fact donated more each year than he received in his annual stipend. The first small church on the site in Pixmore Way opened in 1908 and was designed by Sir Charles Spooner RIBA with a Romanesque facade and was intended to be a temporary church with a presbytery, added in 1909. The church was blessed by Patrick Fenton, the Bishop of Amycla, on 6 September 1908Letchworth Garden City - St Hugh of Lincoln - Taking Stock: Catholic Churches of England & Wales and was dedicated to St Hugh of Lincoln. Fortescue's scholarly interest in the Byzantine Church and his connection with craftsmen of the Arts and Crafts Movement influenced the design of the church's interior, various liturgical items and artwork from which can still be seen in the new church. Today this original church is the Church Hall and has been named 'Fortescue Hall' in memory of its founder.A Brief History of the Church of St Hugh of Lincoln, Letchworth on the parish website Gradually this church became famous for its music and rich liturgical life.Davies, Michael, The Wisdom of Adrian Fortescue, Roman Catholic Books (1999) The Present Church Looking East towards the Sanctuary Looking West The original church had always been intended to be temporary until funds could be found for a larger and permanent building and Fortescue created designs for a new church before his death in 1923. In 1938 a design for a new church was drawn up by John Edward Dixon- Spain of Nicholas and Dixon-Spain and Partners and building of this new church should have started in September 1939 but was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II. In the end work did not start until May 1961, still largely following Dixon-Spain's original stripped modern Romanesque design and with John Willmott & Sons of Hitchin as the builders. The church has a frame of reinforced concrete and steel which is externally clad in brick with Clipsham stone window and door surrounds. The nave is broad and long nave with narrow aisles and with a western narthex and baptistery and a Sanctuary and Lady Chapel to the south. The original flat roof was later replaced with a shallow- pitched concrete roof. The foundation stone was blessed by Cardinal William Godfrey on 7 April 1962, and the first Mass was held on 21 February 1963. Several church furnishings from the old church were moved into the new including the holy water font, the ciborium (removed in the renovations of 2007) and the four stained-glass windows and stone tablet dedicated to Fortescue. Also moved from the old church was the distinctive square alabaster baptismal font designed by Spooner which stands on stone columns and has the inscription ORATE PRO ANIMA EDMONDI FAVRIEL TREVELYAN DEF. XI DEC. MCMXI in memory of Dr Edmond Fauriel Trevelyan (1859-1911), a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and a Justice of the Peace.Edmond Fauriel Trevelyan - Lives of the Fellow - Royal College of Physicians website The Lady Chapel has a marble altar inset with carved panels of loaves and fishes. The three stained-glass panels depicting the Virgin and Child, St Hugh and St Lawrence were brought here from the old church together with the engraved stone memorial to Adrian Fortescue. Hanging in the Sanctuary is a large sixteen-feet in diameter carved icon of the Crucifixion of Jesus by Stephen Foster. In January 2007 at the beginning of the centenary year of the founding of St Hugh‚Äôs Church the Sanctuary and other areas of the church were renovated in order to conform with modern liturgical requirements. On 24 November 2007 the church was consecrated by Bishop George Stack as part of the same celebrations.Dedication of St Hugh of Lincoln Church in Letchworth - Diocese of Westminster - 28 November 2007 In November 2013 Archbishop Vincent Nichols celebrated Mass in the church on the feast day of St Hugh of Lincoln in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the opening of the present church building.

Kneale's practice explores the impact of digital technology on our perception of reality and art. His works have been included in the Moscow International Biennale for Young Art 2016 and are part of important private collections such as the Rubell Family Collection and the Collezione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo. Since early 2015, he has been working closely with ARTUNER. He has taught at the Zurich University of Art and has contributed theoretical articles to Frieze and Spike magazine. He is also the author of the short story Ex Oriente Lux and of the eBook New Abject, a response to Julia Kristeva's 1980 text ‚ÄòPowers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection‚Äô.http://users.clas.ufl.edu/burt/touchyfeelingsmaliciousobjects/Kristevapowersofhorrorabjection.pdf  Education  Paul Kneale obtained a BA in Visual Studies and Art History from University of Toronto. He then moved to the United Kingdom and received his MFA from the Slade School of Fine Art (London) in 2011.http://www.evelynyard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/paul-kneale-cv.pdf. See also http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/mar/21/artist-profile-paul-kneale/  Work  The significance of Paul Kneale's production resides as much in the process of creation as well as it does in the final result. His so-called ‚Äòscanner paintings‚Äô are emblematic of the artist's practice. Resulting from productively misusing copying machines, Kneale's works are obtained by making low and high-resolution scans with nothing placed on the copy-bed in order to capture the twinkle of neon light, atmospheric conditions and the trembling light of the studio by keeping the machine's lid open Finally, the resulting file is printed on canvas, where this otherwise obscure microcosm is transposed through the visual lexicon of the digital, which can assume the form of acidic colours, evocative shapes and oblique stripes. The final goal of his scanner paintings is to crystallise ‚Äì through the gaze of the digital ‚Äì immaterial entities such as space and time, which we all inhabit but that often elude human perception. To do that, Paul Kneale often creates what he defines as a ‚Äòtime sandwich‚Äô; a technique consisting in the overlapping of a fast, low-resolution scan over a slow high resolution one. This way, not only several moments in time co-exist and are captured on the same surface, but also two distinct ways of ‚Äòstretching‚Äô time are recorded on the same work. Kneale also uses everyday objects to address metaphysical questions and ideas. In the ongoing sculptural series ‚ÄòEvent Horizon‚Äô Paul Kneale employs found objects ‚Äì thus expanding on the tradition of the readymade ‚Äì and glass-encased neon components. The title 'Event Horizon' of the original work in the series is a reference to the edge of a black hole, the place from which no light escapes, and thus also where time stops. Here, trash cans, satellite dishes and surveillance mirrors are transformed into contemporary deities by being surrounded by an incandescent halo. The neons themselves are a small simulacrum of the cosmic. They are made using some of the noble gases, such as neon and argon. These gases are contained in glass tubes, and the illumination is activated by high voltage electricity passing through them. However, in sharp contrast with their divinised nature, they also represent objects of transition; transition from using to disposing, from satellite waves to pixels and from reality to distorted records of it. Kneale is interested in the relationship between these abstract, sometimes cosmic theories which exist as ideas, and the scale of the body that both encounters and contemplates things in the world. This series has been developing across several exhibitions and has recently been shown at Palazzo Capris Torino, Moscow Biennale, Rubell Family Collection Miami, Cassina Projects NYC, and Thetis Gardens in the Arsenale Novissimo during the Venice Biennale in 2017. In spring 2018, Kneale had his first solo show Compression in Brussels, which was featured in the Financial Times How to Spend It. In Autumn, his works will be exhibited in Peindre la Nuit, a show taking place at the Centre Pompidou Metz. Paul Kneale's room at 'High Anxiety: New Acquisitions', Rubell Foundation, November 2016- August 2017. In an interview for Spike, Paul Kneale surprisingly states that digital photography is more akin to traditional painting than to analogue photography. Indeed, while analogue photography is generated by a physical trace left by light on the photographic film (index), digital photography is the result of a process of elaboration and interpretation of the objects of reality, as it happens in traditional painting. Indeed, digital photography ‚Äì and therefore, by extension, Paul Kneale's scanner paintings ‚Äì and traditional painting are not a mechanical representation of the elements of reality, but an elaborated reinterpretation of them, mediated in the latter case by the gaze of the human eye and in the former by digital devices which have been programmed according to certain standards by their manufacturers, and subsequently are freely manipulated by the artist.

Singapore‚ÄìSouth Korea relations refer to the relations between the Republic of Singapore and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The relations between the both countries started when a trade mission from South Korea visited the Colony of Singapore in 1950. The two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1975, but South Korea established a trade office and a consulate-general, and sent a special envoy to visit Singapore before that. Both countries are the only two United Nations members in the Four Asian Tigers. In 2014, South Korea was the fourth-largest import source of Singapore.  History  The earliest contact between Singapore and South Korea was dated to April 1950, when South Korean trade delegation paid a 5-day visit to Singapore. South Korea then established a Korea Trade Centre in Singapore in 1964. After Singapore's independence in 1965, the two countries established a fishing venture in 1967. In August 1969, Han Pyo-wook, the Ambassador of South Korea to Thailand, visited Singapore as the special envoy of Park Chung-hee, the President of South Korea, becoming the first official contact between the two countries. During his visit, Han met S. Rajaratnam, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Singapore and handed a \\"special message\\" to Yusof Ishak, the President of Singapore. Some political observers believed that the visit of Han was a \\"counterbalance\\" to the visit of a North Korean special envoy team in the previous month. In 1971, South Korea and Singapore established consular relations by renaming the Korea Trade Centre to a consulate-general. The two countries established formal diplomatic relations in 1975. In 1979, Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore visiting South Korea. The two countries started regular ministerial meetings in the same year. In 1981, Chun Doo-hwan, the President of South Korea paid a state visit to Singapore, making him the first President of South Korea to do so. In 2002, S. R. Nathan became the first President of Singapore visiting South Korea. In 2005, Lim Hng Kiang, the Minister for Trade and Industry of Singapore and Ban Ki-moon, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of South Korea signed Korea-Singapore Free Trade Agreement. It was valid in 2006. When Lee Kuan Yew died in 2015, Park Geun-hye, then President of South Korea, visited Singapore to attend his funeral. Trade relations According to the data from The Observatory of Economic Complexity, the exported value from Singapore to South Korea increased between 1995 and 2014. It reached a peak of 12 billion US dollars in 2014. Singapore mainly exported machines and chemical products to South Korea. The proportion of refined oil in the exported value had increased since 2007. The exported value from South Korea to Singapore was between 4 billion and 6 billion US dollars from 1995 to 2003, and it started increasing since 2004. It reached a peak of 26 billion US dollars in 2012. South Korea mainly exported machines and chemical products to Singapore. The proportion of refined oil in the exported value had increased since 2003, while the proportion of commercial vessels in the exported value had increased after that.  Cultural relations  Lawrence Wong, the Acting Minister for Culture, Community and Youth of Singapore, visited South Korea twice in 2013 for the launch of the exhibition entitled ‚ÄúThe Peranakan World: Cross-cultural Art from Singapore and the Straits‚Äù at the National Museum of Korea and attending the inaugural ROK-Southeast Asia Culture Ministers‚Äô Meeting held in Gwangju, separately. On November 12, 2014, Singapore organized the first ASEAN K-pop Dance Cover Festival.

It is situated on a 35-meter-high coastal headland which closes the northeast side of Cala Morell's bay. This promontory is protected by a dry-stone wall, which is found in the area where the promontory connects to solid ground. It shares many features with another site which is located some kilometers away from it: Es Castellet des Pop Mosquer.http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/fichero_articulo?codigo=3421698&orden;=0 It is one of the 32 Menorcan prehistoric sites that compose the series for the Talayotic Menorca nomination to become World Heritage by UNESCO.http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IDIOMA=3&IdPub;=8675  Characteristics Around twelve dwelling navetes can be seen throughout the site, which are the Bronze Age dwellings that can be found in Menorca and Majorca. There is also an indeterminate 4-meter diameter circular structure built with large stone slabs which was put up on the promontory's highest part. There are two large hollows which were cut through the bedrock towards the settlement's central area, which could have been used to collect rainwater. All the structures within the settlement are enclosed by a dry- stone wall which closes access to the promontory from solid ground. In the side of the promontory which faces the sea there are no remains of defensive structures, since the rocks are high and sheer enough, forming a natural defence.JUAN i BENEJAM, G. i PLANTALAMOR MASSANET, L.

A planimetry was drawn by a research team from the Museum of Menorca in 1996. Nowadays a team of archaeologists in partnership with the Municipal Museum of Ciutadella and the History Museum of Manacor (Majorca) are conducting archaeological excavations in this site. This project, which is called \\"Entre Illes\\" (Between Islands) is in charge of carrying out archaeological research in two coastal headlands: Sa Ferradura (Porto Cristo, Mallorca) and Es coll de Cala Morell (Ciutadella, Menorca), following the same aims and methods in both sites http://www.cime.es/WebEditor/Pagines/file/Ambit/Gener2012/Cala_Morell.pdf. During the past few years two dwelling navetas (11 and 12) and the circular construction erected on the highest part of the settlement have been excavated. Both navetas are oriented to the south and are domestic units which abut the outer wall. Inside these navetas there are benches surrounding a hearth. There is a grinding stone base and a clay structure outside naveta 11 and facing its fa√ßade, and both elements are most likely related to food preparation (cereal grinding). Naveta 12 does not have this type of elements related to it, although it has two small stretches of wall that close its entrance.Anglada, M.; Ferrer, A.; Ramis, D. & Salas, M. 2013.

Manacor: Ajuntament de Manacor: 113-124. Base of grinding stone outside naveta 11 One of the navetas which have been excavated All the evidence, including the structures, the recovered artifacts (pottery, bone tools such as awls and spatulas, grinding stones, etc.) and the huge quantity of domesticated animal bones (goats, sheep, pigs and, above all, cow) ) suggest that the function of these navetas was domestic. Moreover, the complete absence of marine animals (fish, mollusks, crustaceans, etc.) seems to indicate that the inhabitants of this place, despite living by the sea, did not consume or use marine resources. This fact, even though it can seem surprising, is something attested in all sites dating to the Prehistory of the island.Anglada, M.; Ferrer, A.; Ramis, D. & Salas, M. 2013.

Manacor: Ajuntament de Manacor: 113-124. Radiocarbon dating of the site offers an approximate chronology of its occupation between 1600 and 1200 BC.http://www.menorcatalayotica.info/Contingut.aspx?IDIOMA=3&IdPub;=8675 The researchers working at the site sustain the hypothesis of the settlement being located on a promontory due to defence needs caused by social conflict.

In The Remains, John moves his family after his wife passes, but the items that had been left in the house turn out to be haunted. Plot In 1891, a couple visit a spiritualist named Madame Addison at 3:00 AM‚Äîthe so-called witching hour‚Äîin order to try to find their lost daughter. Due to demonic intervention, all five people in the house die that night. Present day, John, whose wife has recently passed, purchases the same house, having no knowledge of the deaths that occurred there more than a century earlier. He is joined by his elder daughter, Izzy, and his two younger children, Victoria and Aiden. One day, while playing hide-and-seek, Victoria and Aiden come across a chest in the attic containing pictures, an old camera, an old doll, and an old pocket watch. Victoria becomes attached to the doll, saying it reminds her of her mother, while Aiden becomes attached to the old camera. John becomes concerned, but at the same time finds himself becoming attached to the pocket watch. His concern grows when Victoria faints, and grows further when he has a dream in which he brutally murders Aiden in his sleep. When he questions the realtor, however, she claims to know nothing about the house's history. Meanwhile, his elder daughter, Izzy, remains aloof, caring more about spending time with her boyfriend than being an active member of the family. One day, in the attic, John sees a girl‚Äîthe daughter of the couple in 1891. John thinks it's just some girl who has wandered into their house, but she tells him to \\"burn them,\\" referring to the contents of the chest, before disappearing. John takes the items that had been in the chest away from the kids and places them in a cardboard box at the end of his sidewalk, but the items reappear in the house. One night, at 3:00 AM, the younger kids, now fully possessed, beat their father nearly to death. When Izzy comes home, she finds her father, on the cusp of death; he tells her to \\"burn the chest.\\" Izzy goes to John's room, collects the items, takes them to the back yard, and burns them. Unfortunately, it is too late. The ghost of Madame Addison kills John. Izzy and the children (now released from the power of Madame Addison) go back into the house and call 911. The call is disconnected and the lights go out. Madame Addison reappears; killing Izzy, Victoria, and Aiden off screen. The film ends with the house being sold to another family by Claire, who remarks that they are right on time, 3:00.

The ES-350T is a further development of the Gibson ES-350 model from 1948 and as such has a completely hollow body. The unique feature of the Gibson ES-350T at the time of its market introduction was the reduced width of the frames. As a result, the guitar has a thinner body compared to instruments with a resonance body that is of full height. The ES-350T, together with its sister models Gibson ES-225 TDN and Gibson Byrdland, was one of the first models of the thinline guitar type. Design The letter T in the model name of the ES 350T stands for thinline and was given by Gibson at the same time as the three new models of hollow-bodies with narrow sides and flat bodies were introduced.May. Vintage guitars and their stories, p. 22 The body of the ES-350T ‚Äì the arched top and bottom as well as the frames ‚Äì is made entirely of laminated maple. The neck of the guitar, glued into the body, is made of maple and has a rosewood fingerboard. The neck is glued to the body at the 14th fret. The fretboard has 22 frets and has inlays in the form of double parallelograms between the frets. Also made of rosewood is the base plate of the two-piece bridge with individually adjustable string rulers made of metal. The lower ends of the strings are held by a trapezoidal metal string holder, which is attached to the lower frame.Gruhn/Carter. Electric Guitars & Basses, p. 205 In addition to the thinline body, another feature of the Gibson ES-350T is its shortened length of only 597 mm (23¬Ω inch compared to Gibson's otherwise 25¬Ω inch). It has been stated that this short scale is due to the jazz guitarist Tal Farlow, who had expressed the desire to make difficult chords and melodies easier to grasp. Against this assumption, when Gibson honoured Tal Farlow with his own signature model in 1962, the Gibson Valley Farlow, ‚Äì it had a standard scale of 648 mm.Franz Holtmann: 'Archtop Heaven ‚Äì Super 400 CES & Valley Farlow 1965,' 'in:' 'Electric Guitars; Special edition of the magazine Guitar & Bass on the history of the electric guitar. MM-Musik- Media-Verlag, Ulm 2004. It is more likely that the short scale came about as Gibson developed the ES-350T from the Byrdland using less-costly hardware and detailing, and offered it as a less expensive model.Duchossior, Andre \\"Gibson Electrics, The Classic Years\\" pp. 57‚Äì60 Hal Leonard Corp., 1998 Both the early ES-350T models and Byrdland models have particularly narrow spacing between the individual strings, which required the manufacture of special, narrow- built pickups for these models. The scale length was extended from 1977 to 1981 to 25.5 inches. The first edition of the ES-350T from the year 1955 was equipped with two Gibson P-90s, which are single coil pickups. By 1957, these were replaced by the newly developed Gibson PAF double coil humbucker pickups, which were developed in the same year.Bacon. Guitar classics ‚Äì all models and manufacturers, p. 137 The pickups are adjusted by means of four potentiometers mounted on the top (one volume control and one sound control) and a three- stage toggle switch close to the cutaway at the neck. This cutaway begun with a rounded \\"Venetian\\" shape in 1955. In 1960 Gibson changed to the \\"Florentine\\" cutaway form with a sharp edge in the frame. Later re-editions of the ES-350T again have the outwardly rounded frame at the cutaway. Gibson's custom shop reissued the ES350T in 1992 as a limited edition in both a traditional vintage sunburst and natural (blonde) finish. These models had gold hardware, Gibson PAF humbuckers, Curly Maple Body, the longer 25.5\\" scale (like the 1977-81 run), and a 1 11/16\\" nut width. Other examples in blonde can be found online dating from 1996, but it remains unclear whether these examples are customer orders or from a specific Gibson issue. From 1996 onward the ES350T has been available as a custom order only, with buyers including Jimmy Page (Led Zeppelin) who acquired a twin p90 model in 2006, which was used in the O2 Arena show on December 10, 2007.http://www.led-zeppelin.org/studio-and-live- gear/80-reference/studio-and-live-gear/jimmy-page-gear/1018-gibson- es-350-electric-archtop Other users include Keith Richards and James Blood Ulmer, who uses an ES350T with a fitted Bigsby alongside his trademark Gibson Byrdland. The ES-350T and Chuck Berry One of the first prominent users of the Gibson ES-350T was American rock and roll guitarist Chuck Berry. Berry used the model exclusively from his first recordings at Chess Records. He first played an ES-350T with two P-90 pickups. This instrument can be seen on most of his early promotional photos, and he recorded most of his legendary recordings of the mid-1950s on it. In 1957, Chuck Berry bought a similar ES-350T, but it was equipped with two PAF humbucker pickups, and he used it on most of his hits from the end of the 1950s.Rockabilly Pickers article on the site \\"Rockabilly Hall of Fame\\" Chuck Berry probably would have continued to play the model, but Gibson's production of the ES-350T was discontinued in 1963, so he switched to the Gibson ES-355, which became his new trademark.

Although the details of Czupryn‚Äôs paintings are hyper-realistic, the overall image is surrealistic, evoking the atmosphere of dreams and imagination. The characters of his paintings‚Äô narrative, usually inspired by acquaintances of the artist, are transformed into machine-like figures whose body is fragmented in independent sections made of natural and artificial elements. In his hypersensitivity to the deconstruction of bodies, and to how bodily parts form a consistent whole, Czupryn‚Äôs paintings are reminiscent of Samuel Beckett literary enquiry.http://www.artuner.com/insight/david-czupryn-and-samuel-beckett-a- comparison-of-somatic-oddities/ Last accessed on 23/03/2017. The difference between the two, however, lies in the fact that for Beckett the dissection of bodies is a way to represent or allude to death, while for Czupryn, it is an attempt to confer a sense of life to the inanimate subjects of his paintings. Although Salvador Dal√≠ and Giorgio de Chirico are important reference points for Czupryn, his main sources of inspiration are the photographer Diane Arbus and American artist Matthew Barney. Thanks to his meticulous, multi-layered technique, his paintings appear flat and digital-like, and the brushstrokes are almost invisible. A further way to achieve flatness is to employ a specific form of lighting - famously used by the photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher - as if it were noon and cloudy. In the guise of an architectural setting, which can narrow or broaden the format of the canvas, the background is usually the first element to be painted by Czupryn. In this way, the characters in the foreground seem to be protruding from the frame in the direction of the viewer, calling for his involvement in the narrative of the portrait.http://www.artuner.com/insight/interview-with-david-czupryn/.

Career  Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© has spent his entire career in finance, more particularly in asset management, covering Continental Europe, the UK, the Middle East, the USA and in Asia-Pacific. He started his career in 1990 at Transoptions Finance, a subsidiary of Cr√©dit Agricole. Between 1996 and 1999, he oversaw the investment management equities and derivatives department at Alfi Gestion and UBS Asset Management France; the company that was acquired by Dexia Asset Management in 1995. From 2000 to 2006, he served as Chief Investment Officer (CIO) for alternative investments and a member of the Executive Committee of Dexia Asset Management. In 2007, he held the positions of member of the Executive Committee of Dexia SA and Chairman of the Executive Committee of Dexia Asset Management, and was named Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Dexia Asset Management. Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© was one of the key actors to lead the company through the 2008 financial industry turmoil. He also steered the acquisition of Dexia Asset Management by New York Life Investments, which was announced in February 2014. Dexia Asset Management then became a New York Life company and changed its name to \\"Candriam Investors Group\\", which stands for 'Conviction and Responsibility In Asset Management.' Next to his role as CEO of Candriam, he was appointed Chairman of New York Life Investment Management International in September 2015, responsible for the activities and development of New York Life Investments' global business outside the USA. Under the leadership of Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√©, Candriam diversified its positioning through three main acquisitions: a 40% stake in London-based private equity real estate manager Tristan Capital Partners, the integration of ABN Amro Investment Management's Paris-based direct investment management teams to Candriam, and the transfer of Rothschild & Co alternative multi-asset unit.  Social responsibility  Candriam has been a pioneer in responsible investment portfolios since 1996. Under the leadership of Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√©, the company further developed its social responsibility engagement. His vision on the future of financial services, and in particular of asset management, is that it should be one of social responsibility and engagement. He has the strong belief that economic agents have a huge responsibility to future generations to help build a sustainable tomorrow. European CEO magazine named Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© \\"Best CEO in the sustainable investment industry\\" and Hedge Fund Review rewarded Candriam with the ‚ÄúBest ESG/SRI management company‚Äù award in 2020. Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© is an active promoter of bridging the ESG knowledge gap in the finance industry. In 2017, Candriam developed the CANDRIAM Academy, a global sustainable investing educational resource, in order to help investors better understand how to analyse, identify, and evaluate sustainable investments. CANDRIAM Academy has more than 4,000 members who have conducted over 8,000 hours of accredited training across 15 countries. He has also been a strong advocate of the development of numerous initiatives and partnerships between Candriam and top- tier academic bodies: LUMSA (Italy), KEDGE (France), Ecole Polytechnique (France), LSE (UK), Imperial College (UK) and Columbia (US), UCL (Belgium). For instance, Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© is overseeing a partnership between Candriam and Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (GRI) at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) on the ‚ÄúJust Transition‚Äù. The initiative will facilitate innovative research, strengthen dialogue and promote the international exchange of ideas on ways to ensure that climate action delivers positive social impact. Na√Øm Abou-Jaoud√© has spoken at many international conferences to foster awareness and regularly refers to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals defined by the United Nations. He has also led Candriam into new areas of the finance sphere: investing with a positive impact. Since 2014, Candriam has allocated over ‚Ç¨5 billion towards companies that demonstrate innovation in biotech, healthcare, climate action, and circular economy. For instance, a dedicated oncology fund has helped advance AI-assisted cancer detection and personalised medicine, while also donating 10% of management fees to leading cancer research institutions.

The Sydney Morning Herald's Harry Robinson claimed that the program was, to any \\"savvy\\" listener, a mash of 1930's folksy corn and a dopey gnome in the ABC's garden. Robinson claimed not much happens on the program apart from a lot of phone calls with little substance, consisting only of lengthy discussions about wombats, curlews, white-tailed spiders and mopokes. Robinson also claimed that it was easy for the program to cater to \\"One Nation types\\", by telling them their world of nice, bland, decent folk is the best of all possibles because they considered change an abomination. In a 2013 article in The Sydney Morning Herald relating to Australian radio personalities, Neil McMahon claimed that few national radio announcers ‚Äúget on your goat‚Äù more than Ian McNamara hosting Australia All Over. To illustrate his point, McMahon included actual complaints about McNamara, which included listeners criticising the way he described an Australian Federal Police officer \\"too pretty to be a geek\\", and the way he asked who the woman was that got ‚Äúthrottled‚Äù by her husband. McMahon also cited another self-proclaimed ‚Äúglued-on ABC listener for 50 years‚Äù who said that he would welcome the day when \\"Macca\\" retires.Radio's good, bad and the ugly, Neil McMahon, The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 December 2013. Retrieved 29 March 2017. Former ABC managing director David Hill has said he understands why McNamara receives some vitriolic criticism as he is philosophically an old Australian working-class conservative and a real non-progressive traditionalist uncomfortable with change. Despite this, it was Hill who convinced the metropolitan ABC stations to take Australia All Over, growing the program‚Äôs estimated audience to 1.5 million.  Awards  In 1988, a 20-minute radio documentary on the re-enactment of The First Fleet Voyage recorded aboard the Swedish barquentine, the Amorina, as it sailed from Hobart to Newcastle produced by Tasmanian Country Hour presenter Tom Murrell, won Best Special Talks and Documentary - Radio International Open for the Bicentennial Media Awards, the Paters sponsored by the Australian Academy of Broadcast Arts and Sciences. Merchandise Since McNamara assumed the role of presenting Australia All Over, the program has spawned a number of books written by McNamara, along with a number of albums featuring music and content from the show, including songs performed by McNamara himself.

It runs within the area of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Neckar (Rhene-Neckar transport association, VRN). It was built in 1875 to shorten the route for trains on the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn) running to Kaiserslautern. In the following years, several express trains ran over this line. Passenger traffic was discontinued in 1987, but it was reactivated ten years later.  History = Planning, construction and opening (1870‚Äì1875) = As early as 1863, a proposal was presented in a memorandum to build the so-called Donnersbergerbahn (Donnersberg railway) from Kaiserslautern via Kirchheimbolanden to a connection on the Rhineland border in Alzey. (Bavarian State Library, Signatur 4 BAVAR 550 dn) The course of the line was planned to run parallel to an important long-distance road that was already important at that time and later became federal highway B 40 and is now largely replaced by the A 63\\\\. During the development of this proposal, a route from Kaiserslautern via Enkenbach was conceived for the first time. Since it was feared that it would have negative effects on the operation and above all the income of the Palatine Ludwig Railway (Pf√§lzischen Ludwigsbahn), it was not built. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and 1871, there was an increased interest in strategic lines in South-West Germany. As a result, demands were made for a direct connection between Kaiserslautern and Enkenbach since the previous line via Hochspeyer was regarded as too indirect, especially after 1873 and 1874, when the Zeller Valley Railway (Zellertalbahn) between Langmeil and Monsheim and the Donnersberg Railway (Donnersbergbahn) between Alzey and Marnheim had been completed. The town of Kaiserslautern was particularly supportive of this, as it stood to benefit. The connection between Kaiserslautern and Enkenbach eventually came into operation on 15 May 1875. It included the intermediate stations of Kaiserslautern Nord and Eselsf√ºrth. = Developments up to the Second World War (1875‚Äì1945) = The operator of the railway was the Palatine Northern Railway Company (Gesellschaft der Pf√§lzischen Nordbahnen). Because the Enkenbach‚ÄìEselsf√ºrth‚ÄìKaiserslautern route is shorter than the route via Hochspeyer, most of the trains in the subsequent period‚Äîespecially long distance trains‚Äîran towards Kaiserslautern via Eselsf√ºrth. They ran via the Alsenz Valley Railway to Langmeil and from there to the Rhine-Main area via Worms to Frankfurt am Main or via Alzey to Mainz. Although it was originally planned to build a second track, it has always remained single-track. On 1 January 1909, the line, together with the remaining railway routes within the Palatinate, were absorbed into the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂nigliche Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen). The line was absorbed into Deutsche Reichsbahn on 1 April 1920. The line was integrated into the newly founded Reichsbahndirektion Ludwigshafen (Railway division of Ludwigshafen) in 1922. After the extension of the Eis Valley Railway (Eistalbahn), which was opened from Gr√ºnstadt to Eisenberg (Pfalz) in 1876, to Enkenbach in 1932, some of its trains ran over the connecting line to Kaiserslautern. During the dissolution of the railway division of Ludwigshafen, the Kaiserslautern‚ÄìEselsf√ºrth section was transferred to the responsibility of the railway division of Saarbr√ºcken on 1 April 1937, while the rest of the line was taken over by the railway division of Mainz. = Recent past = After the Second World War, Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) integrated the railway into the railway division of Mainz, which was assigned all the railway lines within the newly created state of Rhineland-Palatinate. DB received financial support from the federal government, which aimed to maintain the line for strategic reasons within the context of the Cold War. On 1 August 1971, the line came within the sphere of responsibility of Saarbr√ºcken during the dissolution of the railway division of Mainz. Passenger traffic on the line ceased on 29 May 1987. Military considerations prevented a total closure. A year later, after the train crash in the Heiligenberg Tunnel on the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway and its closure between Kaiserslautern and Hochspeyer for about three days, it served as a diversion route for the trains of the Alsenz Valley Railway and for some trains on the trunk line from Saarbr√ºcken to Mannheim. The latter trains were hauled by a diesel locomotive that was attached in Kaiserslautern in front of the electric locomotive and had to reverse in both Enkenbach and Hochspeyer, in order to subsequently follow their regular route. On 1 June 1997, the line was reactivated for passenger operations in order to save trains running on the Alsenz Valley Railway to or from Kaiserslautern having to make the detour via Hochspeyer. However, the two intermediate stations have not been served since then.  Route The route begins at Kaiserslauter Hauptbahnhof and runs next to the Mannheim‚ÄìSaarbr√ºcken railway to the east and then turns northwards. It crosses federal highway 37 and reaches Kaiserslautern Nord station. This is followed by a turn to the north-east and it crosses the A6 and runs parallel to the Eselsbach stream to Eselsf√ºrth station. A few kilometres further east, it reaches the southern edge of the residential area of Enkenbach. It passes through the watershed between the Lauter and the Alsenz and ends shortly after crossing federal highway 48. It joins the Alsenz Valley Railway coming from Hochspeyer to run to Enkenbach station.  Operations The last express trains to use the line ran in 1985. These ran from Paris via the Alsenz Valley Railway and Mainz to Frankfurt.  Operating points = Kaiserslautern Hauptbahnhof = Kaiserslautern Hbf., starting point of the Kaiserslautern‚ÄìEnkenbach railway The station was opened on 1 July 1848 with the opening of the Homburg‚ÄìKaiserslautern section of the Palatine Ludwig Railway. Half a year later the line was extended to Frankenstein and in 1849 the whole route from Rheinschanze (now Ludwigshafen) to Bexbach was open to traffic. In spite of its great importance, it was not until 1875 that it became a railway junction with the opening of the Kaiserslautern‚ÄìEnkenbach railway. It gained additional importance with the opening of the Lauter Valley Railway in 1883 and the completion of the Bieberm√ºhl Railway to Pirmasens in 1913. = Kaiserslautern Nord = The station was on the north-eastern outskirts. The entrance building was built of red sandstone and was thus typical of buildings of the Palatine Northern Railways Company. It had been abandoned even before the temporary cessation of the passenger traffic and it is still not served by passenger trains. = Eselsf√ºrth = The station is located in the Eselsf√ºrth settlement, which is part of Kaiserslautern. The station has a mechanical signal box, which was put into operation in 1938 and is now out of service. The entrance building was also built in the 1930s. No passenger trains stop at this station. A siding connects to a US barracks. = Fr√∂hnerhof = Little is known about the Fr√∂hnerhof operating point. It was used from the 1940s until 29 May 1976. The operating point formed a four-way junction on the single-track line. = Enkenbach = The station is located on the eastern outskirts of Enkenbach. It was opened in 1870 along with the Hochspeyer‚ÄìWinnweiler section of the Alsenz Valley Railway. With the opening the line to Kaiserslautern it became a railway junction. From 1932 it was the western terminus of the Eis Valley Railway.

Frank, then a legal academic, published the book after having undergone six months of psychoanalysis. In it, he argued against the \\"basic legal myth\\" that judges never make law but simply deduce legal conclusions from premises that are clear, certain, and substantially unchanging. Drawing on psychologists such as Sigmund Freud and Jean Piaget, Frank proposed that judicial decisions were motivated primarily by the influence of psychological factors on the individual judge.Walter E. Volkomer, \\"Frank, Jerome N.\\", in Roger K. Newman, ed., The Yale Biographical Dictionary of American Law (2009), p. 201-202.

The performance took place in Los Angeles, California in 1977 as a response to the rapes and murders covered by the media in the \\"Hillside Strangler\\" case.\\"As if the horror of these crimes wasn't enough, the press coverage of the events sensationalized the sexual nature of the crimes. For feminist activists in Los Angeles involved in the movement to end violence against women, this analysis was unacceptable.\\" A continuation of Three Weeks in May, Lacy and Labowitz designed In Mourning and in Rage as a personal response to the sensationalized media coverage of violence against women as well as an expression of grief and rage towards the loss of life. The performance was a collaboration between Lacy, Labowitz, Bia Lowe, Holly Near, City Councilwoman Pat Russel, the Woman's Building, Women Against Violence Against Women, and Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The event was staged for mass media coverage at the Los Angeles City Hall. The performance consisted of a large funeral motorcade of black-clad women lead by a hearse from the Woman's Building to the Los Angeles City Hall. Once there, nine seven-feet-tall women draped in black emerged from the hearse along with a women dressed in red. The mourners then climbed the steps of city hall where each of the nine women gave a statement into a microphone expressing their solidarity with the murdered women, emphasized by a chorus of \\"In memory of our sisters, we fight back!\\" from the rest of the motorcade. By making this performance public as well as highly crafted for media coverage, Lacy and Labowitz looked to highlight not only the deaths of the ten women killed by the Hillside Strangler, but the significantly larger population of women victims whose stories went uncovered by mainstream media. The piece concluded with direct statements to the press explaining the rationale for the piece as well as a speech demanding resources for women's self defense. Singer- songwriter Holly Near performed her song \\"Fight Back\\" which was written specifically for this event.  Legacy  In Mourning and in Rage was highly covered by the press and resulted in increased support from Los Angeles City Council members and a pledge from the Rape Hotline Alliance to provide self defense classes. To further the conversation about social action and art, Lacy and Labowitz produced a video documenting In Mourning and in Rage as well as a pamphlet entitled What is Social Art?.

Now a private residence, it was built in 1796, and served in the 19th century as a stagecoach stop along the main route between Springfield, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The former Bissell Tavern is located in northern Windsor, on the east side of Palisado Avenue (Connecticut Route 159), south of its junction with Hayden Station Road. Palisado Avenue is the major non-highway north-south route along the west bank of the Connecticut River. The tavern house is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof, end chimneys, and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance topped by a four-light transom window. There is a 19th- century porch attached to the south side, and a single-story ell to the rear. The tavern was built in 1796 by Ebenezer Fitch Bissell, Sr. The Bissells were one of the first families to settle Windsor, arriving in 1640. Bissell was a veteran of the American Revolutionary War who had been captured in the Battle of Long Island. The Palisado Green area, just south of the tavern, developed in the early 19th century as a trading nexus, and Bissell's son turned the house into a tavern, a role it apparently kept until about 1833. It has remained in the interrelated Bissell and Hayden families as a private residence since then.

Precursors Before 1855 the supply of guns and ammunition to the Royal Navy was the responsibility of the Ordnance Board, which was also concerned with supplying ordnance to the Army and which tended to concentrate on the latter function, although naval officers served on the board and on the Ordnance Select Committee which succeeded it. The Ordnance Board was abolished in May 1855, its responsibilities for naval ordnance passed to the War Office, where a naval officer was appointed Naval Director-General of Artillery within the Artillery Branch. He retained that title from 1858 to 1868, when he was also Director of Stores, War Office ; he was also the Vice-President of the Ordnance Select Committee.30px This article contains text from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. History A Director-General, subsequently Director of Naval Ordnance, in the Controller's Department of the Admiralty was first appointed in 1866, but he did not take over procurement of naval ordnance from the War Office until 1888 or custody and supply until 1891, when a Naval Ordnance Department was finally established at the Admiralty. By stages from 1908 the Admiralty also took over responsibility from the War Office for inspecting naval ordnance when a Chief Inspector of Naval Ordnance was appointed. The Royal Ordnance Factories, under the control of the War Office, continued, however, to manufacture naval ordnance though a large proportion, including most of the heaviest guns, was let to private contract. From 1917 until the department was responsible for mines and torpedoes. Between 1918 and 1923 and again from 1939 there was a separate Armament Supply Department.The Naval Ordnance Inspection Department was set up in 1922 to control quality in the manufacture and testing of weapons and ammunition for the fleet. Chemical and metallurgical analysis was carried out at its laboratories at Sheffield (the Bragg laboratory) and Caerwent. During the First World War the directorate was divided, and a separate Department of the Director of Torpedoes and Mining was created. After the Second World War in 1946 this became the Underwater Weapons Department. The Bragg laboratory, so-called from 1938, continued unchanged until 1968, when its chemical analysis work became part of the Army Department's Directorate of Chemical Inspection at Woolwich. From 1941 to 1945 there was a Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. In 1958 the two were re-united as divisions of the Weapons Department, under the Director General of Weapons (Director General, Weapons from 1960 to 1964). Bragg continued as the Naval Ordnance Inspection (later Service) and Metallurgical Unit (NOIMU, later NOSMU) until 1984 when it was closed and its work transferred to Woolwich. Caerwent laboratory continued investigating propellants until 1971. Directors Included: =Directors of Naval Ordnance= * Rear-Admiral Astley Cooper Key, September 1866-July 1869 * Captain Arthur W. A.

Early life and education  Mathers, son of Elizabeth Bonsall and John Thomas Mathers, was born in a one-room log cabin in Monroe County, Indiana, four miles south of Bloomington. He graduated from Bloomington High School in 1899. Mathers received the A.B. degree in Chemistry from Indiana University (Bloomington) in 1903. He joined the I.U. faculty as Instructor of Chemistry, while also doing graduate work in electroplating with Oliver W. Brown (1873‚Äì1967) for the M.A. degree in 1905. Mathers was granted a leave of absence (1905‚Äì1907) to work toward his 1907 Ph.D.Frank Curry Mathers, A Study of the Atomic Weight of Indium (Easton, PA, 1907). at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. His doctoral research was directed by Louis Munroe Dennis (1863‚Äì1936). He also studied with Wilder Dwight Bancroft (1867‚Äì1953) at Cornell.  Career and research  Mathers returned to Indiana University in 1907 as Assistant Professor of Inorganic Chemistry. He was promoted to Associate Professor with tenure in 1913, and to Professor in 1923. In 1946-1947, he was Interim Head of the Department of Chemistry. He retired as Emeritus Professor of Chemistry in 1950. Among Mathers' first graduate students was Albert Fredrick Ottomar Germann (1886 ‚Äì 1976) Frank C. Mathers and Albert F. O. Germann, ‚ÄúStudies on Perchloric Acid: Mercurous Perchlorate Voltameter,‚Äù Indiana University Studies, vol. 1, no. 5 (1910), pp. 41‚Äì49; and Frank C. Mathers and Albert F. O. Germann, ‚ÄúMercurous Perchlorate Electrolytic Meter,‚Äù Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society, vol. 19, pp. 69‚Äì80 (1911). In that 68-page issue of Indiana University Studies were four research papers by Frank Mathers; two were publications of master‚Äôs theses. Mathers attended his first Electrochemical Society meeting at St. Louis in the fall of 1904, and joined the Society that year. He was also a member of Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi Lambda Upsilon, and Sigma Xi. Mathers devoted his life to university teaching and electrochemical research. His first research was on electroplating lead from perchlorate solutions. This work was published in Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society in 1910. He continued working on electrodeposition of metals from perchloric solutions. During the first World War, he was asked to come to Washington to prepare fluorine by Wilder Dwight Bancroft, then a Major in the Chemical Warfare Service. Mathers designed an electrochemical cell which was named after him. It produced fluorine by electrolysis of potassium hydrogen fluoride. A modification of his process was used to make fluorine for the preparation of uranium fluoride for the nuclear reactor. Most of his research carried out independently and with his students was on electroplating. He developed a process for the plating of tin and found that aluminum could be plated successfully from a bath of aluminum halides and aromatic hydrocarbons. He authored more than 130 papers in Transactions of the American Electrochemical Society. In addition to his academic work, he spent many summers working in industry.  Personal life  Mathers met his wife, Maude, in class at Indiana University. They married in 1911. They had two sons, Thomas Nesbit Mathers (Indiana University A.B. 1936, J.D. 1939) and William Hammond Mathers (A.B. 1938). William became ill with skin cancer in his final year at Indiana University, dying in September 1938. It is after William that the Mathers Museum of World Cultures at Indiana University is named.

This type of sanitation involves a commercial service which provides toilets and delivers empty containers when picking up full ones. The service transports and safely disposes of or reuses collected excreta. A key benefit of container-based sanitation systems is relative low-cost. In addition, the process assures there is no human contact with excreta. Feces can be contained, carried, transported and emptied into treatment facilities without exposing humans to pathogens. Since 2010, container-based sanitation has typically been used in low-income settings where it is not feasible or appropriate to use or construct sewerage systems. This includes densely- populated urban neighborhoods, informal settlements, areas with high water tables, or where there is risk of frequent flooding. Container-based sanitation systems are a possible, low-cost sanitation solution. They can be used in rapidly growing urban areas, refugee camps and emergency sanitation situations. They are in line with the United Nations‚Äô Sustainable Development Goal 6 to \\"ensure sanitation for all by 2030\\". Background Container-based sanitation systems can be used in rapidly growing urban areas. The pressure to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 ‚Äì ‚Äúto ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation services for all‚Äù ‚Äì is increasing. Current operators of container-based sanitation systems have developed different approaches. As of 2017, several systems are being tested for scalability. With suitable development, support and effective partnerships, some believe that container-based sanitation can be scaled up to provide more low-income urban populations with safe sanitation. Costs for containment, collection, transport and treatment of excreta are expected to be lower than the cost of sewers and water treatment plants.  Overview  Example of a container-based toilet - \\"EkoLakay\\" by SOILA study by Worldbank published in 2019 states that CBS emerged as an alternative service approach for the urban poor in about 2009.World Bank (2019). Evaluating the Potential of Container-Based Sanitation. World Bank, Washington, DC., United States Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a commercial service, typically for a weekly or monthly fee for a 'household subscription', that provides toilets and regularly collects excreta. All infrastructure associated with a container-based sanitation system is typically situated above ground. Excreta-filled containers are sealed and transported by container-based sanitation service providers to a designated treatment or disposal site. Water usage is limited to the amount required for hand washing and anal cleansing. Households do not have to build their own toilets (such as pit latrines) but can sign up for a service by the CBS service provider. One of the main advantages of container-based sanitation is that it is a modular system. Each aspect of the system (from technology to business model) can be adapted to fit the context. Like pay-per-use public toilets, household subscription container-based sanitation services enable customers to discontinue usage if they so choose. The advantage of low upfront cost is another similarity to public toilets. The capital required for installing some household toilets and sanitation systems can be prohibitive. Container-based sanitation toilets can be installed with very little upfront cost. The underlying principles of a container-based system can appear superficially similar to models of excreta management, which also contain excreta in-situ. These might be bucket toilets or pan latrines. Excreta is carried in open containers which are likely to be emptied before proper treatment. In India, the term, manual scavenging refers to emptying pit latrines. The key distinction is that while a container-based sanitation system can include manual collection of containers, the containers or cartridges are sealed and the excreta is treated. People do not come into contact with waste throughout the entire service chain of containment, emptying, transportation, treatment and disposal or reuse. Proponents also note that users have more freedom of choice in that container-based toilets are portable and customers could choose another service provider. = Service chain =  The toilet  A container-based sanitation toilet typically requires no water and can often be moved quite easily. The removable container for excreta is routinely exchanged for an empty container when it is full. The toilet bowl often has a lid. Odor is eliminated by adding a dry cover material or using a biodegradable plastic film. The goal is to eliminate human contact with feces, reduce odor and avoid attracting insects. In most cases, but not all, container-based sanitation systems require separation of urine and excrement. Therefore, a urine-diverting dry toilet is often used. These types of toilets are simple and minimize the volume of waste in the excreta container. Diverted urine is often drained into the soil if the water table is low enough. It can also be stored long enough for pathogen die-off so it can be used as plant fertilizer.  Container transport  Containers vary in size from 5 liters to 208 liters, depending on the particular system. After sealing, the containers are transported by service providers to centralized facilities where the waste is removed and processed. Containers are then disinfected before being delivered to a customer again.  Treatment, disposal and reuse  Waste processing can take many different forms, from simple pathogen reduction to full resource recovery techniques. Resource recovery from human waste collected by a container-based sanitation system is comparatively easier to convert into energy, animal feed or soil amendments. There is far less liquid to remove and treat since toilet waste has not been mixed with water from other household tasks. Currently, the most common method of resource recovery is thermophilic composting. Others options are conversion to uncarbonized and carbonized biomass fuel, using black soldier fly larvae to produce protein-rich animal feed, and anaerobic digestion for biogas production.  Applications CBS systems may be applicably especially for poor urban populations in dense urban slums. Other applications can include areas where: * Floods are possible or they are difficult to reach (such as hilly terrains or settlements above or very near to water courses). * The ground conditions are not suitable for the installation of latrine pits, septic tanks, or sewers * Landlords are not willing to invest in toilets; * Water shortages make sewer-based solutions more challenging * Refugee camps have been built = Humanitarian response = In 2017 at the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya, the container-based sanitation system run by Sanivation was shown to be cheaper than pit latrines, given the costs associated with installation and frequent de-sludging.Diego Hakspiel, Andrew Foote and Julian Parker (2018) Container-based Toilets with Solid Fuel Briquettes as a Reuse Product - Best Practice Guidelines for Refugee Camps, Sanivation and UNHRC Due to quick installation, minimal permanent infrastructure and relatively low costs, container-based sanitation proved to be a system that was easily shipped to new areas and quickly scaled to match refugee, emergency sanitation or disaster response needs. In response to the earthquake that struck Port-au- Prince Haiti in January 2010, the non-profit organization SOIL mounted the first large-scale humanitarian response using container-based sanitation. The organization constructed over 200 public toilets in 32 camps for internally displaced people throughout the city. Over their five-year humanitarian response program more than 20,000 people accessed these container-based sanitation toilets. Over 700 metric tons of waste was converted into compost and sold to the agricultural sector.  Costs  Families pay significantly less for a household subscription (that includes a toilet) compared to the cost of constructing a latrine or pour flush toilet. For example, Ghana households of up to five users pay about 9 USD a month. For the public sector, container-based sanitation systems offer a cost-effective option. Low infrastructure investment relative to sewer-based sanitation systems make systems attractive. Costs are also kept down because water and energy are not needed. Although container-based sanitation systems have shown considerable potential for cost recovery through service fees and sales of final products, the need to continue experimenting and identifying the right elements for business models and public financing remain.  Society and culture  = Government approvals = Container-based sanitation has gained official recognition in Kenya as a safe and cost-effective alternative to sewers and on-site sanitation systems. However, many regions have yet to take any official stance on container-based sanitation. Some service providers are currently working together with local government partners to conduct World Health Organization Sanitation Safety Planning, which is a modular risk assessment process used to systematically understand and mitigate health- related hazards for each link of the sanitation chain. The Container-Based Sanitation Alliance was formed in November 2016 to share information on ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù and collaborate on building industry standards of safety. =Trivia= A packaging toilet may have been imagined for the movie The Martian (film). The protagonist gets the nutrients to grow potatoes by cutting open many sealed aluminum pouches, each holding the solid waste of other astronauts.  Examples and types  Schematic showing how container-based sanitation can achieve hygienic and productive recycling of feces. The basic concept of the container-based sanitation system is being applied by various organizations and businesses around the world, differentiated mainly by the types of toilet interface used, financing models, and reuse or disposal methods. =Social enterprises as service providers=  Clean Team  Clean Team is a social enterprise providing safe, affordable in-home container-based sanitation toilets for low-income families in Kumasi, Ghana. It began operations in 2011 as a joint venture between Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) and Unilever. Toilets are provided at no initial cost, with a weekly charge paid by customers for a ‚ÄòSwap & Go‚Äô service to collect full sealed containers and replace them with clean, empty containers.[8] Clean Team transports the waste and ensures its safe disposal and treatment at a processing center owned by Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly.  Loowatt  Loowatt is an enterprise that develops safe, closed-loop container-based sanitation solutions. Loowatt toilets are waterless and linked to value-generating treatment systems. Loowatt works across global markets serving diverse users, including customers at events and festivals in the UK, and urban households in low-income markets. In 2017, Loowatt toilets were being tested in five countries.  Sanergy: Fresh Life Toilet  Sanergy is a social enterprise making safe sanitation accessible and affordable in Africa's urban informal settlements where there are no sewer connections. Sanergy's approach to solving the sanitation crisis involves five key steps: building a network of container-based sanitation franchises offering affordable ‚ÄòFresh Life Toilets‚Äô; supporting its operating partners with access to finance, training, and marketing; collecting the waste regularly and safely removing it from the community; converting the waste into valuable end products, such as organic fertilizer, insect-based animal feed, and renewable energy; and selling the end products to Kenyan farms. As of October 2017, Sanergy serves 50,000 people daily through a network of 1,300 facilities in Nairobi.  Sanitation First: GroSan Toilet  Sanitation First, a UK and India based non-profit organization, has developed a container-based system suitable for use in India that does not contravene the country's strict manual scavenging laws. The toilet, which they call a \\"GroSan Toilet\\" has an interface based around that of a urine-diverting dry toilet. Within the toilet superstructures are two spaces: one for the toilet and another for anal cleansing with water. Underneath, containers separately receive the three types of excreta: feces, urine, and anal wash water. Once full, the containers are taken to a central treatment facility. The waste products are stored, treated and disposed of safely, generally as an agricultural compost. As of November 2017 some 5,000 people were daily using these kinds of toilets in the Union Territory of Puducherry and Cuddalore, in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.  EcoLakay Toilets  The non-profit organization SOIL was established in Haiti in 2006, providing affordable household container-based sanitation services in some of the world's poorest communities. Feces collected in locally made, urine-diverting container ‚ÄòEkoLakay‚Äô toilets are transported to a composting facility, where they are safely transformed into agricultural-grade compost. This compost is then sold for agricultural application, improving both the fertility and water-holding capacity of local soils. Revenue from monthly user fees and compost sales are used to cover a part of the ongoing service costs.C. Remington, M. Cherrak, N. Preneta, S. Kramer, B. Mesa (2016) A social business model for the provision of household ecological sanitation services in urban Haiti, 39th WEDC International Conference, Kumasi, Ghana, 2016  Sanivation  Sanivation is a social enterprise based in Kenya that partners with institutions to turn feces into a sustainable fuel. Sanivation offers mobile or permanent models of their ‚ÄòBluebox‚Äô toilet: a locally built, urine-diverting, dry container-based sanitation toilet. This waste is processed using their proprietary treatment technology, which harnesses solar-thermal energy to safely treat the waste and transform it into charcoal briquettes for sale, creating a financially sustainable and business model for sanitation services that can also be replicated.  x-runner  x-runner Venture is a women-led enterprise that works in Lima, Peru. Operations began in early 2012, piloting a dry-toilet and waste collection system, as well as a treatment process. x-runner provides customer households with a portable dry toilet from Separett. In less than an hour, a toilet is installed in a user's home and accumulated waste is collected on a weekly basis. The waste is then safely processed into compost by x-runner. Households pay a monthly fee for the toilet rental and collection service. In the past six years, x-runner has been providing safe sanitation to hundreds of households in Lima, Peru. Mosan Mosan is a Swiss social enterprise active in Guatemala providing circular sanitation systems, which include the Mosan Urine-Diverting Dry Toilet for in-home use. The toilet itself is mobile, contains two removable containers and a smell valve to avoid smell from urine. It is produced from PE plastics which make it easy to clean, long-lasting and aspirational for users. The Mosan services provides collection and transport of excreta and ensures safe transformation into fertilizers. The comprehensive systemic solution improves health conditions, protects the environment and water sources, while creating local business opportunities. =Packaging toilet= A packaging toilet is a dry toilet which seals all the excreta from one bowel movement into its own package. It does not use water. The smell of excreta is sealed away from other users of the toilet. The design goes back to 1936, where it was used in Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion house. That toilet used shrinkwrap plastic for packaging the waste. Other designs are currently marketed by various companies.

The building is on the western side of Nassau Street, spanning the entire block from Fulton Street to Ann Street. It has three street addresses: 93-99 Nassau Street, 139 Fulton Street, and 30 Ann Street. The building was designed by Arthur D. Gilman in the French Second Empire style, with expansions by James M. Farnsworth that closely followed Gilman's original design. The Bennett Building contains a fully realized cast- iron facade, the largest known such example in the world, and is one of two remaining Second Empire-style office buildings south of Canal Street with cast-iron faces. The building's three fully designed facades face Fulton, Nassau, and Ann Streets, while the fourth side faces an adjacent property and is made of plain brick. The building's namesake was James Gordon Bennett Jr., who commissioned the project as an investment. The original structure designed by Gilman was seven stories tall, including a mansard roof. After real estate investor John Pettit bought the building in 1889, he commissioned Farnsworth to design two additions. The original mansard roof was demolished and the top four stories were added from 1890 to 1892, while an eleven-story annex was erected on Ann Street in 1894. After Pettit disappeared in 1898, ownership of the Bennett Building passed to several other companies and individuals, who made minor modifications to the building. In 1995, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the building a New York City landmark. The Bennett Building is also a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district created in 2005.  Site  The Bennett Building is located in the Financial District of Manhattan. The building faces Nassau Street to the east, Fulton Street to the south, and Ann Street to the north. Having frontage on all three streets, it has three street addresses: 93-99 Nassau Street, 139 Fulton Street, and 30 Ann Street. Nearby buildings include the Fulton Center to the west; the Keuffel and Esser Company Building to the southeast; 5 Beekman Street and the Park Row Building to the north; and St. Paul's Chapel to the west. A staircase to the New York City Subway's Fulton Street station (served by the ) is outside the Bennett Building's southern facade. The Bennett Building's plot is \\"L\\" shaped, measuring about on Fulton Street, on Nassau Street, and on Ann Street. According to the New York City Department of City Planning, the lot covers . When built, the Bennett Building occupied a smaller lot, quoted as being on Nassau Street, on Fulton and Ann Streets, and on the western lot line. The annex has a frontage of about on Ann Street and is deep.  Design  The Bennett Building is a cast-iron loft building designed in the French Second Empire style. It contains ten full stories as well as a two-story penthouse. The Bennett Building was originally seven stories, with the top story as a mansard roof. The original section was designed by Arthur D. Gilman and is the only remaining building in Manhattan that he designed. The mansard was a characteristic of the Second Empire style, but the cast-iron facade was a new design at the time of its completion. The top three floors and penthouse was added in 1890‚Äì1892, and an 11-story extension of the building on Ann Street was added in 1894, both to designs by James M. Farnsworth. Both of Farnsworth's additions carefully followed Gilman's original design. The Bennett Building is largely a commercial and office building, with 159 units, seven of which are residential. With a height of , the Bennett Building was described as being probably the world's tallest building with a facade made of cast-iron. In addition, it is one of two remaining Second Empire office buildings in Manhattan south of Canal Street with a cast-iron facade, the other being 287 Broadway. Although there are other cast-iron buildings from the same era below Canal Street, such as the Cary Building and 90‚Äì94 Maiden Lane, they were used for other purposes, mainly mercantile. =Facade= The three facades contain paneled vertical pilasters, segmental-arched windows, and cornices. The facade is split into eight bays on Fulton Street, twelve bays on Nassau Street, and eleven bays on Ann Street, as well as two bays at the northeastern and southeastern corners. The corners were originally framed with corner pavilions, and the ground floor was originally designed as a raised basement. Like cast-iron contemporaries, the Bennett Building contains several repeating sections on its facade, but unlike similar buildings, the columns are not stacked atop each other. The base, seen at the corner of Fulton and Nassau Streets in 2020At ground level, there were originally four entrances: one on either end of the Nassau Street side, as well as one each on the western ends of the Fulton and Ann Street sides. The original entrances were decorated with columns and entablatures, which originally supported round arches. The Nassau Street entrances were one bay wide, within the third and tenth bays from south to north, while the Fulton and Ann Street entrances were two bays wide, spanning the seventh and eighth bays from east to west. Following renovations in the 1980s, the Bennett Building has three entrances: a main entrance on Fulton Street (east of the original entrance arch there), a second-story entrance on the southern portion of the Nassau Street side, and a freight entrance on Ann Street. The ground story was initially designed as a raised basement, with each bay separated by cast-iron rusticated vertical piers. The Ann Street facade is still designed in this way, but the Fulton and Nassau Street sides are recessed behind storefronts. The Bennett Building's facade above the ground floor consists of bays separated by paneled pilasters; projecting cornices with moldings above each floor; arched door and window openings; and scrolled corbels flanking the window openings. Large projecting pilasters flank the corner bays, the original entrance bays on Fulton and Ann Street, and the easternmost two bays on Fulton and Ann Streets. Near the top of each window frame, there are molded labels on each pilaster. A entablature with dentils and a parapet runs above the tenth floor. The three westernmost bays on Ann Street are part of the 1894 annex. They are designed nearly identically to the rest of the facade, with minor differences in decorative detailing, and rise eleven stories instead of ten. The western facade of the building and the twelfth-story penthouse are designed in plain brick and faces a small light court rising above the first story. =Features= The lowest six stories of the original structure on Fulton and Ann Streets are load- bearing walls, while the Nassau Street side is a non-bearing curtain wall. The top four stories, the penthouses, and the front wall of the Ann Street annex are also non-bearing walls, as these sections were built with cage construction. At the time of the Bennett Building's construction, cast-iron was typically used for a single curtain wall, and most cast iron buildings were five to six stories high. Structures at corners such as the E. V. Haughwout Building could use cast-iron for two walls, one being a bearing wall and another being a non-bearing wall. Records from the New York City Department of Buildings reported that the interior structure of the original building was made of timber. Architectural writers Sarah Landau and Carl Condit, however, stated that timber girders would have been unusual for a building as large and prominent as the Bennett Building was. Landau and Condit's observations found that the floors were instead carried on brick arches, set between wrought-iron beams, whose centers were spaced apart. The beams, in turn, rested on cast-iron brackets attached to the building's brick partition walls. According to an 1873 advertisement in the New York Herald (whose owner James Gordon Bennett Jr. had developed the Bennett Building), the structure's offices ranged from small \\"cubicles\\" to relatively large spaces measuring . The Herald advertisement indicated that the building had a $125,000 rent roll per year, with rent rolls on the upper floors being progressively lower than on the lower floors, except for the ground-floor storefronts. The building was meant to attract insurance, mercantile, brokerage, and legal firms at the first floor, and bank and insurance company offices on the second floor. The Bennett Building was built with two elevators and two stairs. The elevators reportedly ran at a then-unprecedented speed of , but their precise location is unclear. When the building was completed, elevator technology was still relatively new, which was one possible reason for why the rent roll was smaller on the upper floors. The building had steam heating from the outset, and after the advent of electric lighting, its owners added a generating plant. =Plaque= In 1916, the Maiden Lane Historical Society erected a plaque on the building that reads: \\"Nassau StreetKnown originally as'The Street that Runs by the Pye Woman'And was named in honor ofThe House of NassauWhose head at the time wasWilliam the ThirdKing of EnglandAnd sometime Stadtholder of the Dutch RepublicNassau Street became identified withThe jewelry tradeMore than half a century ago.\\"  History  James Gordon Bennett Sr. founded the New York Herald in 1835, and within ten years, it become one of the United States' most profitable newspapers. After moving the Herald multiple times in its first decade, Bennett Sr. bought the northwest-corner lot at Fulton and Nassau Streets in 1843. He eventually owned all the buildings at 135‚Äì139 Fulton Street, 30‚Äì34 Ann Street, and 93‚Äì99 Nassau Street. After the burning of the adjacent Barnum's American Museum at Broadway and Ann Street in 1865, Bennett Sr. hired Kellum & Son to build a fireproof structure for the Herald on the Barnum's site, completed in 1866. At the time, residential buildings in the area were being replaced by commercial developments. These tended to be fireproof structures of between four and six stories, utilizing the most advanced technology available at the time, such as elevators. Furthermore, Nassau Street had become one of New York City's busiest areas for office workers by the 1870s. = Construction and early years = Bennett Sr. turned over control of the Herald to his son James Bennett Jr. in April 1867. Bennett Jr. commissioned Gilman to design a new building to replace the Herald old headquarters at Fulton and Nassau Streets, to replace several smaller buildings at that site. Gilman filed building plans several days after Bennett Sr. died in June 1872. Gilman proposed constructing a cast-iron building with seven stories, the top story being located within a mansard roof, with then-modern features such as fireproofing and elevators. The fireproof features were a precautionary measure added after the Great Chicago Fire in 1871 and the Great Boston Fire of 1872. The building was ready to receive its first tenants by May 1873. Among these early tenants was a private bank named L.S. Lawrence & Company, which was involved in currency exchange and collections. At the time of its completion, it was one of New York City's tallest buildings, towering over other structures on Nassau Street. The Bennett Building was not particularly close to either the courts of the Civic Center to the north or the financial firms physically surrounding Wall Street to the south. The financial downturn of the Panic of 1873 temporarily slowed down construction in the city, but when the economy recovered, buildings such as the Morse Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the Temple Court Building were built nearer the Civic Center to cater to lawyers. This led the Real Estate Record and Guide to describe Bennett Jr.'s development of the Bennett Building as \\"a little too previous\\" in 1882. Additionally, its height had been surpassed by other structures like the Morse Building by the 1880s. = Expansion = alt= Real estate developer John Pettit bought the Bennett Building from Bennett in October 1889 for $1.6 million. By then, the elevators and other mechanical systems were antiquated. In addition, the interiors were dirty, the management staff was considered inadequate, and the high ceilings were considered to be an inefficient use of space. The New York Times stated that the building \\"had since been left in the rear by the march of improvement\\". Pettit specialized in developing office buildings in New York City, and he often partnered with architect James M. Farnsworth, who had helped design the Morse and Temple Court buildings. A contemporary publication stated of the sale, \\"The name of Pettit is in itself a sufficient guarantee of bona fide transactions so long has it been connected with honorable and upright dealing\\". Shortly after Pettit bought the Bennett Building, was hired to design a three-story extension to the building, which entailed demolishing the sixth floor mansard and adding three floors plus a penthouse. Workers also refurbished the interior and replaced the elevators and other mechanical systems. The floor additions commenced in 1890 and were completed in 1892. The tenants of the newly expanded building included a Postal Telegraph Company branch, a United States Congress member, architects, bankers, publishers, and manufacturers. Pettit bought a lot at 28 Ann Street, to the west of his existing property, in 1894. Farnsworth was hired to constructed an extension of the building along the new lot, in almost exactly the same style as the old building. The renovations cost $200,000 in total, but because Pettit had taken out a $300,000 second mortgage, he did not have to invest any of his own money. By the time the expansion was completed, tenants were quickly filling up the vacant space. In May 1894, Pettit sold the original Bennett Building, but not its annex, to Theodore A. Havemeyer for $1.5 million. However, the sale fell through following month because of disagreement over whether Bennett Jr. had a right to bid at the sale of his father's estate's properties. The annex was initially considered a separate building, but it had no entrance of its own, leading the New-York Tribune to describe the annex as \\"the only office structure without its own entrance in this city\\". After the annex was completed, the building was said to be worth $2 million, and the New York Life Insurance Company held a $500,000 mortgage on the property. = Early and mid-20th century = In the years following the renovation, Pettit fell into debt, and New York Life appointed a receiver to collect the Bennett Building's rents. With a lawsuit pending against him, Pettit disappeared in mid-1898. That August, the building was sold to Henry B. Sire for $1.5 million. In 1904, as a result of a foreclosure suit, the Bennett Building was sold to New York Life for $907,000. The building was characterized at the time as \\"an unfortunate experiment made in real estate\\" by Pettit. The Bennett Building was then resold for $1 million in April 1906 to Philadelphia investor Felix Isman, who planned to renovate the Bennett Building. Isman also anticipated acquiring the Ann Street annex at an upcoming foreclosure sale against Sire, the annex's owner. George B. Wilson took ownership of the building the same year. That December, a controversy emerged over an unmetered water pipe in the building: the owners were found to have owed $2,550 () over seventeen years, but Wilson, Isman, and New York Life would not take responsibility. In response, city officials ripped out the water pipe during the middle of the day, while a bathhouse in the building was operating, causing the bathhouse's patrons to complain. Ultimately, Isman and the city came to an agreement, and the water pipe was put back with a meter. Wilson's family retained ownership until at least 1919, when the New York- Tribune reported that it had been sold to a \\"syndicate of well-known real estate men\\". However, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) stated that the building remained in the Wilson family's ownership through the 1940s. Either way, the building was sold to Jackadel Associates by 1949. Jackadel closed the northern entrance on Nassau Street, and moved the Ann Street entrance and the southern Nassau Street entrance to street level. The original entrance from Fulton Street had been closed by then, because a staircase to the Fulton Street subway station was directly in front of the doorway. The Bennett Building was sold again in 1951 to Harry Shekter, who planned to use the building as an investment. At the time, the Bennett Building was assessed at $700,000. = Late 20th and early 21st centuries = The Bennett Building was sold to Haddad & Sons Limited in 1983. Under Haddad's ownership, the building's exterior was slightly modified. New storefronts were added on Fulton Street and on the southern portion of the Nassau Street side; the ground-level facades on these sides were moved outward by . The main entrance was moved to Fulton Street from Nassau Street, while the Nassau Street entrance was changed so that it led to a staircase to the second floor. A canopy was added on all three sides above the ground floor. The Bennett Building was also repainted in aqua, cream, and pink. ENT Realty Corporation bought the building in 1995 and leased it to a consortium led by Robert Galpern. Around the same time, preservationist Margot Gayle led an effort to have the Bennett Building preserved as an official city landmark. Galpern objected that landmark status would make it harder for him to conduct even basic repairs. On November 21, 1995, the LPC made the building a New York City designated landmark. On September 7, 2005, the Bennett Building was designated as a contributing property to the Fulton‚ÄìNassau Historic District, a National Register of Historic Places district.  Critical reception  Shortly after the Bennett Building was finished, it was described as \\"one of the most substantial and beautiful\\" buildings within New York City. In its first two decades, it had become known as an unofficial landmark of Lower Manhattan, and was described as \\"one of the largest and stateliest piles down-town\\". In 1991, Christopher Gray of The New York Times described the building as appearing to \\"have been swarmed by herds of brackets\\". Following the Bennett Building's landmark designation in 1995, Gray stated that the building, \\"once one of New York's notable skyscrapers\\", had become \\"lost among the retail pandemonium of Upper Nassau Street.\\" See also * List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street References =Notes= =Citations= =Sources=  * External links * 1873 establishments in New York (state) Buildings and structures completed in 1873 Cast-iron architecture in New York City Financial District, Manhattan Historic district contributing properties in Manhattan New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan Office buildings in Manhattan ","title":"Bennett Building (New York City)"},{"id":"53631032","text":"Alex Wilkinson (born 4 September 1996) is an English cricketer.

The strikes come as a response to a budget cut of 450 million dollars to the public university system, proposed by the controversial Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act. A national assembly, which took place on the 5th of April, was attended by 10 of the 11 campuses, the University High School, the Conservatory of Music of Puerto Rico, and the Escuela de Artes Pl√°sticas y Dise√±o de Puerto Rico. They voted in favor of an indefinite systemwide strike, which began on April 6. However, the systemwide strike affected 8 of the 11 campuses immediately, as 3 campuses attending the assembly had not reached the required amount of attendants for their votes to be counted. Despite this, each of these campuses held individual assemblies which saw them vote in favor of going on strike, both indefinitely and definitely. The strike ended on June 7, 2017, when the last remaining campus still on strike, Humacao, voted during an assembly to end their shutdown.

Personal life Born to a prestigious religious family of the Rahanweyn clan, Abbas spent an overwhelming majority of his life living in Dadaab Refugee Camps. By the age of 5, his parents moved with him and his siblings to Liboi Refugee camps in 1991 and later relocated to Dadaab refugee camp in 1992. Abbass as a bright young kid started his education with Qur'anic Dugsi (school) and completed learning the holy Qur'an before the age of 10. His father was a Sheikh and a respected scholar in the Somali community and so is his grandfather. It wasn't too long before he had a full grasp of the ahadith (prophet's teachings) and the Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence). He started primary school by the then Jack Asiyo Primary School later renamed as Halane Primary School (1994-1998) and proceeded to Midnimo (\\"Unity\\") primary school for Upper Primary education (1999-2001). He finished high school at Ifo Secondary School (ISS)http://ifo.secondary.school.co.ke/title=Ifo Secondary School in Ifo Camp (Dadaab) in 2005. He later proceeded to Nep Technical Training College (NEP TTC) in Garissa, NE Kenya. It was at NEP technical where Abbas had his first exposure to politics and was the president of the Students Union. Historically, there has always been a tension between the Somali students and the non-Somali students at Nep Technical. It was Abass that brokered peace between the two teams. He's remembered in his former alma mater as \\"Abass, the president, the peace maker!\\" He later joined Kenya Methodist University and then Moi University to pursue a degree in Business Administration. With high hopes and dreams of changing his motherland, Abbas went back to Somalia in 2011 to take a job with the humanitarian agencies working in Somalia. He worked with the likes of FAO and later fully moved on embarking politics. In 2016 he was selected by an Electoral college for the position as MP for Kismayo (House of the People) in the current term of the Federal Parliament of Somalia, otherwise known as the Tenth Parliament. Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction thumb On 21 March 2017, Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire named Hon. Siraji as the next Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction. He took office on 4 April during a handover ceremony at the Ministry of Public Works, making him the youngest ever cabinet member at age 31. In his short period as a public works minister, Abass implemented far more projects than the entire cabinet combined. This made him the most popular and one of the most loved politicians in Somalia. According to the Ministry of Public Works and Reconstruction website, Hon. Abass was in office for only one month but has done more than 30 months of tasks/work.  Agent of peace and hope  Hon. Abass is widely regarded as an agent of peace and hope for the Somali nation. In his early years in college, he brokered a peace deal between different student factions (who were arch rivals) in his college. That gave him the title \\"Peace maker.\\" He carried that same attitude and mentality in Federal government level. Many of his colleagues in the parliament and cabinet have attested that he brought together politicians that have not spoken to each other for decades. He was a friend to everyone and slowly instilled peace between rival politicians. He represented hope for Dadaab Youth and the Somali community at large. He was the first person from Dadaab to hold such a high government office. Everyone looked up to him and started dreaming of the days they will all go back home. He was young, educated, energetic with a vision of prosperous Somalia with functioning government institutions. He breached peace, unity and love. Somalia was waking up to a new dawn, a new reality, a new hope.  Community and charity work  Besides his public service to the nation, Abbass was doing multiple community and charity work. He was involved in the construction of water wells in his hometown of Afmadoow and his constituency. He was also building the Somali nation a few students at a time. Abass was paying for the tuition fees of close to a dozen Somali students both in Somalia and Kenya. This has never been disclosed prior to his death making it genuine work of nationalism. Abbass's vision was to eradicate poverty & diseases like tribalism and terrorism through education. He believed the root cause of all evil was ignorance and he was ready to fight it to his last breath. Death thumb Initial reports suggested that Siraji was shot and killed on 3 May 2017 when soldiers on a patrol opened fire as he drove his vehicle near the Villa Somalia. The circumstances of the shooting were not immediately clear. Media reports said the soldiers may have perceived Siraji's vehicle as a threat. A number of people have been reportedly arrested in connection with his death. Later reports have indicated that Siraji was traveling in his car behind a vehicle convoy bearing the Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah, when the bodyguards of the latter apparently somehow mistook Siraji's car for a VBIED being driven by a suicide bomber targeting the Auditor General and so opened fire on it. All evidence however suggest that this was a planned assassination carried out by the Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah. The Auditor General Nur Jimale Farah, spoke with the media immediately after his security team assassinated the late minister and claimed that there was a fire exchange but all evidence (including CCTV cameras) and eyewitness accounts indicate that there was no existence of such fire exchange. There were only two shots fired from Nur Jimale Farah vehicle that killed the minister (execution style). The minister received a full state funeral the day after his killing, attended by President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed and Prime Minister Hassan Ali Khaire along with other senior figures.

He pioneered the development of the Malaysian statistical system and was instrumental in the development of the New Economic Policy after 1969. In 1977, he was invited to join the World Bank as its Statistical Adviser. At the Bank, he designed the World Bank's flagship statistical abstract, the World Development Indicators. In his capacity as the Statistical Adviser, he was actively engaged in statistical capacity-building in member countries. He also played a major role in the development of statistical standards, which included the 1993 System of National Accounts and the methodology for the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Survey program for collecting household data. After retiring from the World Bank in 1996, he became an independent consultant and took on several assignments. He founded an independent consultancy named the Cresset Research Group (CRG). The CRG was actively engaged in advising international development institutions and countries in the creation of sustainable statistical systems.  Early years and education  Born in Kuantan, Pahang, Ramesh Chander had a challenging childhood conditioned by the Japanese Occupation of Malaya during the Second World War and the disruptions associated with the early years of the Malayan Emergency. In 1953, he completed secondary school at Abdullah School, Kuantan, whereupon he went on to the Queen‚Äôs University of Belfast in Northern Ireland. He graduated with an honors degree in Economics, Politics and Philosophy in 1958. In later years, he completed the Advanced Management Program at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.  Chief Statistician of Malaysia  In 1958, he returned to a newly independent Malaya and joined the Federal Department of Statistics as an economic statistician. In 1963 at age 28, he was appointed the Chief Statistician of Malaya, becoming the first Malaysian national to hold the position. He was also the youngest head of a Federal department at the time and worked closely with the country's founding Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman. As the Chief Statistician, he developed a fully functioning statistical system. He pioneered the use of integrated household surveys for the collection of information for poverty analysis and the compilation of socio-economic indicators. He also carried out the landmark 1970 Census of Population and Housing. The Chief Statistician was a key player in the formulation of economic policies. He was part of the team that developed the New Economic Policy, which was the basis for Malaysia's affirmative action policies promoting ethnic Malay advancement. = Landmark 1970 census = In 1968, he began planning the 1970 Census, the first to be undertaken after Malaysian independence. After the May 1969 race riots in Malaysia, the Census became a politically sensitive project as the data would bring to light disparities among the country's ethnic groups. The successful Census undertaking was particularly challenging as there was no institutional memory from prior national censuses. Under his leadership, the Census was innovative in several ways. Using the latest available computing technology in the Malaysian government, the Census pioneered the use of new optical scanning technology. The Malaysian approach was adopted by other countries in the region. By the early 1970s, the Malaysian statistical system had come of age. It not only generated a full range of quality data but had a growing research capacity. With the available data, Malaysia was able to engage in collaborative studies with the World Bank and other institutions. The Census formed a key data source for the development of Malaysia's New Economic Policy, which promoted affirmative action for ethnic Malays in order to avoid the political strife that led to the 1969 riots. He also developed a framework for monitoring New Economic Policy targets and goals. = Economic development = He developed the Malaysian statistical system from a small entity of 200 persons to 2000 persons between 1963 and 1977 through a systematic expansion program for producing policy-relevant statistics. As a result, the Malaysian statistical system became a recognized and respected institution in the international statistical system. He played an active role both within the region and globally: *Chair of the Conference of Asian Statisticians *Elected to the UN Statistical Commission, serving as a Vice‚ÄìChair from 1972 to 1976 *Malaysian representative at the Commonwealth Conference of Statisticians *Founding member of the Statistical Institute for Asia and the Pacific (SIAP) for training statistical personnel from all countries in the region; served as member of the Governing Council of the Institute *Member of the Technical Committee for the World Fertility Survey  World Bank  In 1977, Robert McNamara, President of the World Bank approached the Government of Malaysia, for the services of Datuk Chander to join a team that was to produce a new flagship publication called the World Development Report. = World Development Indicators = He designed the World Development Indicators, an annex to the World Development Report. The Indicators became a model adopted by other international organizations in presenting statistical data. = China, the former Soviet Union, and other developing economies = In 1980, he pioneered the estimation of the Gross National Product of China. He reviewed the functioning of the Chinese statistical system. Later his work improved the statistical capacities of African and transition countries, and he advised on adjustment and reform issues. He also managed and coordinated technical assistance programs for statistics to countries of the former Soviet Union, China, Mongolia, the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Brazil, and others. With the adoption of economic reforms in China and the former Soviet Union, the statistical systems of each centrally planned economy had to be adapted to meet the needs of their emerging market economies. For instance, neither country measured economic growth in terms of GNP or GDP prior to the reforms; thus his work served to transform the collection and use of economic data in these countries. Further work included the conceptualization of approaches to estimating Purchasing Power Parities using limited information sets and the promotion of the initiative globally. He developed the strategy and methodology for measuring poverty incidence through integrated household surveys, now known as the World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Surveys.http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/lsms/about In 1993, he provided substantive contributions to the revision of the System of National Accounts, and later he led the effort to reform statistical cooperation arrangements in the UN interagency system. = Statistical Adviser, principal policy adviser on statistics = As the World Bank's Statistical Adviser, he was the principal policy adviser on statistics to senior managers of the World Bank and the World Bank‚Äôs spokesperson and chief representative at international meetings including the UN Statistical Commission. As the Statistical Adviser, he collaborated with the World Bank's Chief Economist and Vice President, Development Economics, positions held by Stanley Fischer and Lawrence Summers. He was responsible for the formulation of the Bank's statistical policy, standards and delivery of technical assistance in statistics to member countries.  Advisory work  Upon retiring from the World Bank in late 1996, he took on several high-level short-term advisory assignments: *UN: advised the President of the UN General Assembly on UN reform issues *ASEAN: created strategies for regional economic integration *Commonwealth Secretariat: undertook major study on the East Asian Economic crisis for Commonwealth Ministers of Finance *CIDA Canada: designed long-term multi-million-dollar technical assistance program for the modernization of China‚Äôs statistical system *China‚Äôs National Development and Reform Commission: created framework for monitoring and evaluating China‚Äôs 10th Five Year Plan *Government of China: advised on establishing the Boao Forum, analogous to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland He also developed for the World Bank a framework for preparation of Strategic Master Plans, a pre-requisite for Bank and other donor financing of capacity-building programs. He founded an independent research consultancy that has specialized in the preparation of Statistical Master Plans /National Strategies for Development of Statistics. These Plans for over a dozen countries, including Afghanistanhttp://www.paris21.org/sites/default/files/afghan-smp-2004.pdf provided the basis for loans and credits from the World Bank for statistical capacity building.

Charitable works =Trustee of \\"Tyrrell's Gift\\"= Waldron's earliest recorded involvement in charitable activity was his acting as a trustee of \\"Tyrrell's Gift To The Poor\\", being a bequest of ¬£200 made by Walter Tyrrell in his will dated 20 May 1568. Waldron was one of the overseers of the will, by which he was granted discretion to purchase land annuities or yearly rents \\"for the maintenance and relief of some of the poor people of the town and parish of Tiverton. Waldron executed a deed poll dated 18 September 1575 by which he gave, granted and confirmed to John Waldron, junior, and Thomas Boutey, guardians of Tiverton Church, and to their successors and to ten other persons an annuity or yearly rent of ¬£10 and 13 shillings to be issuing out of certain messuages and lands in Tiverton, to hold the same annuity unto the said guardians and their successors, and to the said trustees and their heirs for ever. And he appointed, that the said church gnardians and their successors should collect and receive the said rent of ¬£10 13 shillings out of the said lands, and dispose of the same weekly among six of the most needy, poor, impotent and indigent persons of the said town and parish, by them to be nominated and chosen; that is to say, eight pence a week, to each, making in the whole ¬£10 8 shillings, the churchwardens, or as many of them as should execute the trusts, retaining the remaining five shillings between them for their pains; such payments to be made weekly to the poor persons so appointed, and to continue for their lives, unless they should he guilty of some notorions crime, or be of dissolute lives, in which case some others should be appointed in their rooms; and it was directed, that when the trustees should he reduced to three, the survivors should convey the annuity to eight other trustees, together with the churchwardens\\".Report of the Commissioners Concerning Charities; Containing that Part which Relates to the County of Devon, by the Commissioners for Inquiry into Charities, Volume I, Exeter, 1826, pp.78 et seq, \\"Public Charities of the County of Devon (Hundred of Tiverton)\\", =Waldron's Almshouses= By a deed poll dated 19 October 1577Report of the Commissioners Concerning Charities, p.79 \\"John Waldron of Tiverton, Merchant\\" gave to the two churchwardens of St Peter's Church, Tiverton, and to eight further trustees, an annuity of ¬£24, payable quarterly out of his manor of Daccombe (near Paignton) and from all his lands in Tiverton. They were to distribute it weekly to \\"eight of the most needy, poor, impotent and indigent persons of the town of Tiverton, by them to be appointed\\", to every one 12 pence per week. \\"The poor persons should be entitled for life, unless they should be guilty of any crime or be of dissolute life\\". The remainder was to go to the trustees as remuneration. Almshouse building Waldron's Almshouses, entrances to ground floor rooms The Almshouse was built in open fields on the outskirts of the town of Tiverton, near the \\"Wellbrook\\" stream.Information panel outside Waldron's Almshouses The town has since greatly expanded to surround the site, and \\"Wellbrook Street\\" now runs past the Almshouses. A large modern complex of charitable housing was built in the 20th century to the rear of the Almshouses by the \\"Tiverton Almshouse Trust\\". The two-storey Almshouse occupies the eastern part of the building and was designed for 8 \\"poor, impotent and indigent\\" men of Tiverton, each occupying a single room.Listed building text The upper floor is reached by an external staircase leading to a covered gallery landing. In 1847 they were in \\"a most dilapidated state\\", as described by Harding in his History of Tiverton.Harding Lt.Col. F. G. S., History of Tiverton, 1847, p.79 They were restored in 1987, as is recorded on a plaque inscribed: :\\"This plaque was unveiled by the Earl of Halsbury FRS, F.Eng., on 6th March 1987 to mark the restoration of these 16th century Almshouses\\". The exterior of Waldron's Almshouses is decorated with profuse relief sculpture. An inscription in Gothic lettering across the front elevation under eaves is as follows:Text per brass tablet inscribed: \\"Presented by Tiverton Evening Townswomen's Guild 1972\\" (date of death with transposition error \\"1597\\". The actual date of death is \\"1579\\" as sculpted several times in stone on his chest tomb in Tiverton Church. Text also given with modernised spellings and minor differences in :\\"\\"John Waldron merchant and Richord his wife builded this house in the time of their life. At such tyme as the walls were fourtyne foote hye.

Above the lintels of the doors on the ground floor are painted the following three sentences:Text per brass tablet, 1972 \\"Depart thy goods whyle thou hast tyme; For after thy death they are not thyne; God sav Quen Elizabeth\\". Chapel The chapel occupies the western part of the building. It has a projecting porch to the west with a moulded doorway with carved spandrels. The porch is surmounted by a stone parapet, profusely decorated with relief sculpture, including ships and elephants, indicating Waldron's membership of the Guinea Company and his involvement in the Ivory trade. Another parapet at roof level is similarly decorated. On the exterior wall of the Chapel is a small black tablet inscribed: :\\"This plaque was unveiled by Lady Margaret Amory, JP, on 11th April 1990 in thanksgiving for the restoration of John Waldron's Chapel and its continuing use as a place of worship\\". The bell measuring about 18 inches in diameter, was made in 1539 by Aelbert Hackman in the Duchy of Cleves in the Holy Roman Empire. It is the oldest bell in Devon to bear a date in its inscription. The engraved inscription between two decorative friezes reads as follows: \\"In the year 1539 Aelbert Hackman cast me in Cleve. Jesus, Mary, Ann\\". This was therefore one year before Anne of Cleves became the fourth wife of King Henry VIII. Landholdings His landholdings included the following: *Colridge, Devon, rectory of, which in partnership with Robert Northcote the elder of Crediton, he purchased in fee simple from the crown on 26 January, \\"to hold in free socage issues from All Saints last, the advowsons of the Vicarage reserved\\".

These infestations and infections cause distress to companion animals, and in livestock industry the financial costs of these diseases are high.Wall, R.

This article provides an overview of parasitic flies from a veterinary perspective, with emphasis on the disease-causing relationships between these flies and their host animals. The article is organized following the taxonomic hierarchy of these flies in the phylum Arthropoda, order Insecta.Pittaway, A.R. (1991) Arthropods of Veterinary Importance: a Checklist of Preferred Names and Allied Terms. Wallingford, England, CABI Publishing, . Families and genera of dipteran flies are emphasized rather than many individual species. Disease caused by the feeding activity of the flies is described here under parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under transmitted organisms; prominent examples are provided from the many species. Adult Chrysomya megacephala blowfly, known as bazaar fly, feeding by sponging at organic waste from where it may transmit harmful bacteria  Summary of types of disease associated with types of dipteran flies Disease caused by the feeding activity of dipteran flies is described here under parasitic disease. Disease caused by small pathogenic organisms that pass from the flies to domestic animals is described here under transmitted organisms; these organisms are often of numerous species thus only prominent examples are provided. Feeding by adult flies may cause irritation through acute stress from painful bites, resulting in loss of grazing time and reduced gain in weight.Byford, R.L. (1992) A review of ectoparasites and their effect on cattle production. Journal of Animal Science 70: 597-602. Feeding by adult flies on the blood of their hosts exposes the hosts to pathogenic organisms that are infecting the fly, this can lead to acute disease of the host's blood and other organs.Kettle, D.S. (1995) Medical and Veterinary Entomology. CABI, Wallingford, UK. .Russell, R.C. et al. (2013). The Encyclopedia of Medical and Veterinary Entomology. CABI, Wallingford, UK. . Feeding by adult flies using their sponging mouthparts can also expose the hosts to pathogenic organisms that have contaminated the mouthparts. Larvae of some flies are adapted to feed on the tissues of their host, causing direct pathological damage to organs; this is known as myiasis.Mullen, G.R. (2009) Medical and Veterinary Entomology.

Nematocera (suborder)  = General characteristics= Antennae are usually long, with many similar and symmetric segments. These are small to very small flies, usually of delicate morphology with relatively long legs and wings. Body and wings are often covered in fine scales. Thorax is distinctly humped, abdomen is elongated. All species of veterinary and medical importance are blood feeders, with various types of mouthparts (these variations do not relate clearly to dipteran taxonomy).Smart, J. (1948) A Handbook for the Identification of Insects of Medical Importance. London, British Museum (Natural History). Aedes aegypti female mosquito engorging with blood. Lifecycle is a complete metamorphosis with larvae that are nonparasitic, living in environments such as pools of water, soil, and streams. A complete metamorphosis is illustrated by the photograph of Stomoxys eggs, larvae, and adult (Stomoxys are in suborder Brachycera). Only females feed on blood, taking a large meal to support production of several hundred eggs, followed by several more cycles of blood meal followed by egg laying.Lehane, M.J. (1991) The Biology of Blood-sucking Insects. London, Harper Collins, .Edman, J.D. (1971) Host feeding patterns of Florida mosquitoes. 1: Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia, Mansonia and Psorophora. Journal of Medical Entomology, 8: 687-695. doi: 10.1093/jmedent/8.6.687. Males feed on plant nectar and similar sources of sugars. Lifecycle of Stomoxys showing a typical complete metamorphosis from eggs at top left, to three larval stages, followed by transformation as the pupal stage into an adult female or male = Disease relations= Nematocerans are very important as transmitters of viruses, protozoa, and nematode worms. Also, they are often important for biting stress when in large numbers, and may cause allergic reactions at their feeding sites. A typical pathway of transmission of organisms by blood-feeding flies is shown below as a virus transmitted by an adult fly that feeds repeatedly on several hosts (see diagram for Biological transmission, and photograph of Culicoides). Insects that transmit pathogenic organisms are commonly known as vectors. The diagram shows what is known as biological transmission (= developmental transmission) because it is necessary for the transmitted organism to develop in the fly to the state where the organism is at an infective stage of its lifecycle.Mellor, P.S. (1995) The transmission and geographical spread of African horse sickness and bluetongue viruses Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology 89: 1-15. The repeated cycles of egg laying and feeding of the female fly (= gonotrophic cycle) provides the opportunity for the transmitted organisms to develop, multiply, and be exposed to further vertebrate hosts where they can complete their lifecycle. Only the adult flies are involved in this biological transmission, in contrast to biological transmission by other arthropods such as lice or ticks in which all active stages of the lifecycle feed on blood. = Mosquitoes (family Culicidae) = Typical genera are Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles  Morphology, lifecycle, hosts, and feeding The basic structure of dipteran flies is illustrated in the diagram. Veterinary parasitology also covers arthropods in the class Acari, the ticks of domestic animals, and mites of livestock, which have distinctly different structure from arthropods in the class Insecta. However, flies in the order Diptera show clear division of the body into head, thorax, and abdomen with distinct segmentation of the thorax and abdomen. The thorax contains large blocks of muscle that power the single pair of wings. Digestive and reproductive organs fill the abdomen. Also unique to the Diptera is a pair of halteres (derived from wings during evolution) that aid agile flight by these flies.Snow, K.R. (1990) Mosquitoes. Slough, Richmond Publishing Co. Ltd. .Lane, R.P. & Crosskey, R.W. (1993) Medical Insects and Arachnids. Chapman & Hall, London. Mosquitoes have veined and scaled wings, long legs, and long hypodermic mouthparts sheathed in a protective labium (see photograph of Aedes female engorged with blood). Adult females lay eggs in batches on surfaces of stagnant water. Larvae feed on microorganisms and organic detritus in water. Pupation occurs at the surface of the water. Feeding by females is on a wide variety of mammals and birds, whilst males feed on plant sugars. Transmission pathways of biological transmission of bluetongue virus by Culicoides female midge feeding first on a reservoir cow, then on three susceptible sheep  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms Culicoides imicola stages of gonotrophic and transmission cycle: top left = unfed female, unable to transmit; bottom left = first blood-meal, may become infected; top right = female after laying an egg batch, ready to feed again; bottom right = a further blood meal that could have involved transmission of pathogenic organism. Microfilaria stage of Dirofilaria immitis, heartworm, in blood of a dog (for scale the grey discs are stained red blood cells) Biting stress can be severe in varied climatic regions (cold northern or tropics) or conditions of much surface water available for breeding where populations of mosquitoes can become dense.Lancaster, J.L. & Meisch, M.V. (1986) Arthropods in Livestock and Poultry Production. Chichester: Ellis Horwood Ltd. . Species of genera Aedes, Anopheles and Psorophora transmit equine encephalitis viruses to horses. Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles species of mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium protozoa that cause types of malaria in birds. Culex mosquitoes transmit West Nile virus between birds and horses; they transmit Rift Valley fever virus to livestock species and humans. The nematode worm Dirofilaria immitis that causes heartworm disease in dogs is transmitted by species of Culex and Aedes.Simon, F. (2009). What is new about animal and human dirofilariosis? Trends in Parasitology 25: 404-409. See photograph of microfilaria stage of Dirofilaria immitus in blood of dog; adult worms in dog's heart grow to several centimeters long. (Mosquitoes are of major importance as transmitters of many types of pathogenic microorganisms to humans causing diseases such as malaria and yellow fever. Plasmodium species causing malaria in humans are exclusively transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes.) Phlebotomus pappatasi sandfly engorged with blood = Biting midges (family Ceratopogonidae) = Typical genera are Culicoides and Leptoconops (the term \\"midge\\" is also used for dipteran flies that are harmless to domestic animals such as those also known as lake-flies (Chironomidae).  Morphology, lifecycle, hosts and feeding These are small to minute flies (a typical vernacular name is \\"no- see-ums\\"). Wings are veined, short, and rounded, usually with distinctive patterns of dark brown on clear backgrounds. Mouthparts are relatively short and complex with three pairs of cutting or slashing elements that create a superficial wound from which blood is imbibed. Lifecycle is similar to that of mosquitoes: female feeds on blood, matures, and lays batch of eggs repeatedly. Males are not blood feeders. The site for larval development is within wet soil and bogs. Hosts of biting midges are wide variety of mammals and birds.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms Severe biting stress to cattle, sheep and horses is caused. Horses suffer from a cutaneous hypersensitivity reaction called sweet-itch, or Queensland-itch that is caused by antigenic components of saliva of biting midges.Schaffartzik, A. (2012). Equine insect bite hypersensitivity: What do we know? Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 147: 113-126. Anderson, G.S., et al.

Poultry may be severely afflicted with biting stress. Species such as Culicoides imicola and Culicoides variipennis transmit bluetongue virus between sheep and cattle (see diagram and photograph above), and they transmit African horse sickness virus between horses and other equids. Culicoides midges transmit Leucocytozoon protozoa to poultry birds.Du Toit, R.M. (1944) The transmission of Blue-tongue and Horse-sickness by Culicoides. Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Science and Agricultural Industry. 19: 7-16. = Sandflies (family Psychodidae)= The important genera are Phlebotomus (distributed in Africa and Eurasia) and Lutzomyia (distributed in the Americas).Freeman, P. & De Meillon, B. (1953) Simuliidae of the Ethiopian Region. London, British Museum (Natural History). The term \\"sandfly\\" is often used to refer to various other types of flies.  Morphology, lifecycle, hosts, and feeding Sandflies are like small versions of mosquitoes, but also with overall furry appearance from many long setae (like hairs) on body and wings (see photograph of Phlebotomus pappatasi). Mouthparts are medium length. Lifecycle is similar to midges: site for egg laying and larval development is surface of relatively dry soil. Many species of mammals and birds are used as hosts. Females suck blood using medium length complex mouthparts, whilst males feed on plant sugars.  Transmitted organisms  Species of Phlebotomus and Lutzomyia sandflies are notorious as transmitters of species of Leishmania protozoa that cause visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in domestic animals and also humans.Svobodova, M., et al. (2009) Cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum transmitted by Phlebotomus tobbi. International Journal for Parasitology, 39: 251-256. doi:10.1016/j.ijpara.2008.06.016. Dogs become infected with Leishmania infantum and L.tropica; the infection can slowly develop into a multi-organ stage with fatal consequences. Simulium latipes blackfly = Black-flies (family Simuliidae)= The typical genus is Simulium, but also Cnephia and Austrosimulium are locally important.  Morphology, lifecycle, hosts, and feeding These are medium nematocerans, halfway in size between mosquitoes and midges. The body is compact, wings are clear except for veins close to leading edge, and antennae are short with compact segments appearing like rings. Thorax is dorsally humped and dark brown or black (see photograph of Simulium). Lifecycle is similar to mosquitoes: females lay eggs on plants at surface of streams and rivers; larvae settle onto solid substrate in water and feed on suspended organic detritus; pupation occurs at water surface. Hosts are most livestock species, horses and poultry and many wild animals. Humans also may be severely distressed by blackflies. Feeding is through skin with short complex slashing mouthparts.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms Severe biting stress when they seasonally swarm near running water. Severe anaphylaxis may develop rapidly in previously sensitized hosts, potentially leading to death of cattle. Simulium black-flies transmit to Leucocytozoon protozoa poultry. They also transmit Onchocerca nematode worms to cattle causing bovine onchocerciasis.Fischer, P., et al. (1993) Parasitological and clinical characterization of Simulium neavei transmitted onchocerciasis in western Uganda. Tropical Medicine and Parasitology. 44: 311-321.  Brachycera (suborder) The former suborder Cyclorrhapha is now usually classified as part of the Brachycera. = General characteristics. = Mouthparts of Tabanus horse-fly: sensory palp at left, sponging labella at center, skin-piercing elements at right. Haematopota pluvialis tabanid fly showing distinct patterns on eyes and wings. Antennae consist of three relatively short segments with asymmetric shapes. Brachyceran flies are of medium to large size and compact shape. They have large compound eyes, well developed wings, and generally fly during daytime seeking food and mates. Life-cycle is a complete metamorphosis, as for Nematocera. However, in contrast to nematoceran flies which have larvae always non-parasitic and living in the general habitat, some species of brachyceran flies are parasitic in their larval stage whilst the adults that develop from these larvae are non-parasitic. This parasitism by brachyceran larvae causes the disease myiasis. Some of the brachyceran flies are important transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission.Scoles,G.A., (2008) Comparison of the efficiency of biological transmission of Anaplasma marginale (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) by Dermacentor andersoni Stiles (Acari: Ixodidae) with mechanical transmission by the horse fly, Tabanus fuscicostatus Hine (Diptera: Muscidae). Journal of Medical Entomology 45:109-114. Desquesnes, M & Dia, M.L. (2004) Mechanical transmission of Trypanosoma vivax in cattle by the African tabanid Atylotus fuscipes. Veterinary Parasitology, 119: 9-19. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts that make a superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. Fresh blood on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such as a group of species of genus Glossina, are important biological transmitters, not mechanical. = Horse-flies (Family Tabanidae). = Typical genera are Tabanus, Haematopota, Chrysops and Hybromitra, also many other genera of importance to domestic animals in some regions of world, tropical and subtropical South America especially.Oldroyd, H. (1952) The Horse-flies of the Ethiopian Region, Vol 1. Haematopota and Hippocentrum. London, British Museum (Natural History).Oldroyd, H. (1954) The Horse-flies of the Ethiopian Region, Vol 2. Tabanus and related genera. London, British Museum (Natural History).  Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding.  These are large robust flies with massive eyes that often show colored patterns. Antennae are characteristic with three dissimilar segments projecting forward from head. Wings are large and strong with complex venation, and often with complex patterns of brown on clear background.Austen, E.E. (1909) Illustrations of African Blood-sucking Flies other than Mosquitoes and Tsetse-flies. London, British Museum.Edwards, F.W., et al. (1939) British Blood-sucking Flies. London, British Museum (Natural History). These flies are adapted to hunt widely for their hosts during daytime. Females take repeated small blood meals from their hosts to support development of a large batch of eggs. Eggs are laid on wet soil where larvae develop, sometimes over one or two years by feeding on soil organisms. Males do not feed on blood. Hosts of females include all species of mammalian livestock animals and horses. Tabanid flies have large mouthparts comprising three pairs of cutting / slashing elements that pierce skin in a superficial wound. Blood flowing from this is imbibed through a sponge-like element of the mouthparts, the labella (similar to that shown in photograph of Calliphora).Dickerson, G. & Lavoipierre, M.M.J. (1959) Studies on the methods of feeding of blood-sucking arthropods: III.‚ÄîThe method by which Haematopota pluvialis obtains its blood-meal from the mammalian host. Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology. 53: 465-472.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  Bites of tabanid flies are painful. Dense populations of these flies cause severe biting stress to livestock and horses leading to reduction of gain in liveweight. These hosts may additionally suffer loss of grazing time by clustering in tight defensive packs, a situation known as fly-syndrome. Many genera of tabanid flies transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma evansi that causes in camels and horses the disease called surra.Reid, S.A. (2002) Trypanosoma evansi control and containment in Australasia. Trends in Parasitology, 18: 219-224. These flies also transmit the protozoan T.vivax that causes in cattle the disease called nagana. Tabanid flies are also transmitters the bacteria Anaplasma marginale and A.centrale to cattle, sheep and goats, causing anaplasmosis. = House- flies, Stable-flies and similar (Family Muscidae). = Typical genera are Musca, Hydrotaea, Stomoxys and Haematobia. Mouthparts of Calliphora blowfly showing sponge structure of labella at lower right.  Morphology, life- cycle, hosts and feeding.  These are medium to large flies of compact structure, with clear wings of complex venation. Antennae are highly characteristic with antennae consisting of several compact segments that lie in a deep groove between the eyes; the outermost segment of each antenna bears a feather like structure, the arista, which projects forwards. Species within Musca, Hydrotaea, and similar genera have mouthparts adapted for sponging nutritious liquids with their labellar lobes (see photograph of Calliphora mouthparts which also have this sponge structure). Some species of this type, such as Musca vestustissima (Australian bush-fly) also have, as part of this sponge structure, small teeth that can scrape at host's skin down to superficial capillaries to feed on blood.Hughes, R. D., et al. (1972) A synopsis of observations on the biology of the Australian bushfly (Musca vetustissima Walker). Australian Journal of Entomology. 11: 311-331. Cattle are a typical host for Musca and similar species of house-flies that are attracted to protein containing liquids at the eyes and nostrils of their hosts. Species within the genera Stomoxys stable-flies, and Haematobia horn- flies are highly adapted for blood feeding, having mouthparts consisting of a strong projecting labium with cutting elements at its point.Zumpt, F. (1973) The Stomoxyine Biting Flies of the World. Stuttgart, Gustav Fischer Verlag. This is used to pierce deeply into skin of host to access blood (see photograph of Stomoxys in the Gallery below. Females of these flies typically take repeated small meals from their hosts to support production of their batches of eggs. Both females and males feed only on blood. Cattle and domestic buffalo are also the main hosts of Stomoxys and Haematobia flies.Guglielmone, A.A., et al. (1999) Skin lesions and cattle hide damage from Haematobia irritans infestations. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 13: 324-329. doi:10.1046/j.1365-2915.1999.00167.x.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  Irritation is caused by large numbers of Musca house-flies, through to severe biting stress from dense populations of Stomoxys or Haematobia flies. Musca house-flies, face-flies, and similar types transmit a variety of bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle.Hillerton, J. E., et al. (1983) Hydrotaea irritans and summer mastitis in calves. Veterinary Record 113: 88-88. doi:10.1136/vr.113.4.88. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by Moraxella bovis bacteria transmitted by Musca autumnalis face-flies.Glass, H.W. & Gerhardt R.R. (1984) Transmission of Moraxella bovis by regurgitation from the crop of the face fly (Diptera: Muscidae). Journal of Economic Entomology ,77: 399-401. The feeding of various Musca species of fly permits the contaminative transmission of nematode worms, for example Parafilaria bovicola, causing a nodular filariasis in cattle. Stomoxys species transmit several species of Trypanosoma protozoa to cattle, sheep and goats causing various types of trypanosomiasis. Haematobia horn- flies transmit nematode worms in the genus Stephanofilaria to the skin of cattle, causing stephanofilariasis, a suppurating dermatitis known as hump sore. Stomoxys flies transmit the bacterium Eperythrozoon ovis to sheep and this infection may lead to fever and anemia. = Tsetse-flies (Family Glossinidae). = Glossina adult tsetse fly; piercing mouthparts conspicuous. There is one genus in this Family: Glossina, known as tsetse-flies or simply tsetse.Leak, S.G.A. (1999) Tsetse Biology and Ecology: their Role in the Epidemiology and Control of Trypanosomiasis. Wallingford, CABI Publishing, . Flies of this family are similar to Stomoxys flies within the Muscidae, but have a life cycle and veterinary and medical importance justifying a separate Family designation. Tsetse-flies are found only in sub-Saharan Africa.  Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding.  These flies are closely similar to Stomoxys and Haematobia, but are larger and of a paler brown color. Tsetse-flies of both sexes are robust fliers adapted for hunting their hosts during daytime. Male adults support their mating activity with repeated meals of blood from cattle and similar wild bovid hosts, also wild pigs and warthogs are favored. Life-cycle of tsetse-fly is highly specialized. Females take repeated small meals of blood to support the development within their abdomen of a single larvae over one period. This will be repeated for as many times as the female is able to survive, depending mostly on availability of hosts. The single larva emerges fully grown from the female, weighing more than the female. Then the larva immediately burrows into dry sandy soil to pupate within a protective puparium. A new adult emerges from the puparium after a complete metamorphosis. This is known as larviparous reproduction, with the advantage of high survival rate of offspring, but few offspring are produced by each female.Coetzer, J.A.W. (1994) Infectious Diseases of Livestock with Special Reference to Southern Africa, Vol 1. Cape Town: Oxford University Press. .  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  Bites from tsetse flies are painful but these flies are not generally associated with direct causes of lost production in cattle. Glossina morsitans and G.pallidipes tsetse-flies are transmitters of various species of Trypanosoma protozoa causing animal trypanosomiasis (= nagana) in cattle, and other forms of trypanosomiasis in sheep, goats, pigs, camels and horses.Maudlin, I. (2004) The Trypanosomiases. Wallingford, CABI Publishing, .Harley, J.M.B. & Wilson. A.J. (1968) Comparison between Glossina morsitans, G. pallidipes and G. fuscipes as vectors of trypanosomes of the Trypanosoma congolense group: the proportions infected experimentally and the numbers of infective organisms extruded during feeding. Annals of Tropical Medicine & Parasitology 62: 178-187. doi:10.1080/00034983.1968. Tsetse-flies are also notorious as transmitters of the Trypanosoma species causing African trypanosomiasis (= sleeping sickness) in humans. = Blow-flies (Family Calliphoridae). = Important genera include Calliphora, Lucilia, Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia. Chrysomia bezziana, Old World screw-worm, adult fly and third stage larva of type causing myiasis (see header photograph of C.megacephala for colors of live fly).  Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding.  All calliphorid flies are all large, robust, strong day-time fliers. Their antennae are as described above for house-flies and others in the Family Muscidae. Adult flies in family Calliphoridae feed as adults of both sexes mostly on proteinaceous liquids found on surface of decaying animal carcasses and similar material. These liquids are taken in using sponging mouthparts (see photograph of Calliphora). In genera such as Calliphora and Lucilia the females lay their eggs on the same dead animal material and the larvae feed their by rasping at the muscle and other tissues with their mouthparts. However, species of Lucilia and some other genera may opportunistically invade the tissues of live hosts, such as sheep or cattle and feed there parasitically. Other genera such as Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia are specifically adapted for this type of feeding by the larvae.Erzin√ßlioƒülu, Z. (1996) Blowflies. Slough, England, The Richmond Publishing Company. .  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  When larvae of Lucilia feed parasitically they cause the disease facultative myiasis (facultative = opportunistic or optional). When this occurs on sheep it is often known as blow-fly strike. This causes severe distress to the host and may be fatal due to toxemia from ammonia excreted by masses of infesting larvae.Heath, A.C.G., & Bishop, D.M. (1995) Flystrike in New Zealand. Surveillance (Wellington), 22:, 11-13.Waterhouse, D. F. (1947) The relative importance of live sheep and of carrion as breeding grounds for the Australian sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina. Bulletin of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Australia, No.217 pgs 1-37. Females of Chrysomya, Cochliomyia and Wohlfahrtia and similar genera always seek out their host such as cattle, sheep, dogs, to lay their eggs at vulnerable sites such as a small wound. The larvae hatch and rapidly invade the superficial layers of skin to continue feeding there until ready to pupate. This form of parasitism is essential for these types of fly, and causes obligate myiasis (obligate = necessary or essential). This infestation develops into severe disease and can be fatal if the infestation is at a vulnerable site such as ear or navel of the host.Farkas, R., et al. (2009) Traumatic myiasis in dogs caused by Wohlfahrtia magnifica and its importance in the epidemiology of wohlfahrtiosis of livestock. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 23: 80-85. Adult blow-flies such as those in the genus Calliphora can be significant as transmitters of various bacteria involved in mastitis of cattle. The conjunctivitis of cattle known as pink-eye is caused by Moraxella bovis bacteria and may be transmitted by blow-flies. = Bot- flies and warble-flies (Family Oestridae). = Larvae of Dermatobia hominis, Torsalo bot-fly; third stage larva top, first stage larva bottom. Furuncular myiasis at shoulder and neck of cow caused by infestation of Dermatobia hominis larvae. Typical genera are Hypoderma, Gasterophilus, Dermatobia and Oestrus (fly). Oestrid flies at their larval stage tend to be adapted to feed on a few closely related species of host animal and the adult females fly actively to seek out only these hosts on which to lay their eggs. Adult warble fly, Hypoderma iparece, showing furry appearance and lack of mouthparts.  Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding.  Adults are large flies, and unusual amongst brachyceran flies because they have a dense covering of fine setae (like hairs) and colored patterns that make them appear like bumble-bees (Hymenoptera). All species of the Oestridae are so highly adapted to the myiasis type of parasitism that the adults do not feed and have only residual mouthparts (see photograph of Hypoderma iparece).Otranto, D. (2001) The immunology of myiasis: parasite survival and host defense strategies. Trends in Parasitology, 17: 176-182. All these flies have an obligate myiasis life- cycle, with a complete metamorphosis.Scholl, P.J. (1993). Biology and control of cattle grubs. Annual Review of Entomology 38: 53-70. The females lay eggs with high selectivity on their special hosts and at specific sites there. For example, eggs laid on the legs of horses in the case of species of Gasterophilus.Waddell, A.H. (1972) The pathogenicity of Gasterophilus intestinalis larvae in the stomach of the horse. Australian Veterinary Journal, 48: 332-335. The horse licks at the irritated skin and the larvae transfer to the mouth of horse. The larvae penetrate tissues in the oral cavity, feed parasitically whilst migrating through tissue of the esophagus to finally reach the stomach. The final larval stage is completed with the larvae attached to the mucosa of the horse's stomach. When ready to pupate the larvae detach and are voided in the horse's feces. Another example is Dermatobia hominis, torsalo-fly, which is an important parasite of cattle, and sometimes humans, in tropical regions of South America.Lane, R.P. et al. (1987) Human cutaneous myiasis - a review and report of three cases due to Dermatobia hominis. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology, 12: 40-45.Jelinek, T., et al. (1995) Cutaneous myiasis: review of 13 cases in travelers returning from tropical countries. International Journal of Dermatology, 34: 624-626. The larvae cause a localized, furuncular (= like a boil) myiasis in the skin of their hosts. The larvae infest these sites when transported there accidentally by blood feeding mosquitoes; the adult female Dermatobia flies lay their eggs on the legs of mosquitoes, a dispersal mechanism called phoresy.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  Obligate myiasis of various forms are typical of the oestrid genera. Larval Dermatobia torsalo-flies infest the skin and underlying tissues of cattle causing distress, reduced gain in weight and damage to skins used for leather. Larval Gasterophilus stomach-bots infest the upper gastric tract and stomach of horses and other equids.Edwards, G.T. (1982) The prevalence of Gasterophilus intestinalis in horses in northern England and Wales. Veterinary Parasitology, 11: 215-222. Larval Hypoderma warble-flies infest the skin and muscles of cattle. Larval Oestrus nasal-bots infest the nasal cavities of sheep and goats.Yilma, J.M.; & Dorchies, P. (1991) Epidemiology of Oestrus ovis in southwest France. Veterinary Parasitology, 40: 315-323. In the case of stomach-bots it is often uncertain how much clinical disease or loss of production small levels of infestation causes the host. With infestations of warble-flies and nasal-bots severe distress to the hosts may be caused and there are production losses from reduction of value of cattle hides, and reduced grazing time by sheep. Harm to cattle may be caused through panic (known as gadding) at the approach of the flies if that leads to traumatic injury. There are no organisms of known importance transmitted by oestrid flies. = Louse-flies (Family Hippoboscidae). = Melophagus ovinus sheep-ked: male at left, female center, puparium right. Genera of importance are Melophagus and Hippobosca. This is a Family of specialized blood feeding flies with a reproductive cycle similar that described for tsetse-flies. They are often known as louse-flies because some species either shed their wings when as adults they find a host after active flying (in genus Lipoptena). Alternatively flies of genus Melophagus are so adapted to parasitism that the adults never develop wings. Louse-flies without wings may appear like ticks, but the only stage of tick seen with three pairs of legs will be larvae these are much smaller than louse-flies.  Morphology, life-cycle, hosts and feeding.  Adults of the genus Hippobosca are large, robust flies that retain their wings to fly for repeated blood meals, between hosts such as cattle, camels or horses in a herd. Stout piercing mouthparts project downward from the head (see Hippobosca in Gallery). The abdomen bulges largely, especially when containing a developing larva. The life-cycle is the larviparous type, similar to that of tsetse- flies, few offspring are produced per female but their survival rate is high.Hafez, M., & Hilali, M. (1978) Biology of Hippobosca longipennis (Fabricus, 1805) in Egypt (Dipteria: Hippoboscidae). Veterinary Parasitology, 4: 275-288. In species that never develop wings as adults, such as Melophagus ovinus, the sheep-ked, the fully developed larvae are deposited by the female on the hair coat of the host. There pupation occurs rapidly followed by complete metamorphosis into an adult (see photograph of Melophagus).Small, R. W. (2005) A review of Melophagus ovinus (L.), the sheep ked. Veterinary Parasitology, 130: 141-155.  Parasitic diseases and transmitted organisms.  Irritation and biting-stress is caused. Damage to skin results in poor quality of leather when hides are processed, a condition known as cockle. Sheep-keds transmit the bacterium Eperythrozoon ovis to sheep and this infection may cause fever and anemia. They also transmit Trypanosoma melophagium, but this protozoan seems non-pathogenic.  Prevention of infestation and infection = Physical barriers and hygiene= These usually consist of netting made of synthetic fibers or fine metal mesh that is fitted to the ventilation slats or windows of housing for livestock animals. The fiber netting can be impregnated with insecticides such as the synthetic pyrethroid deltamethrin that acts rapidly when flies such as Stomoxys or Glossina species land on it.N'Guessana, R. & Asidia, A. (2010) An experimental hut evaluation of PermaNet¬Æ 3.0, a deltamethrin‚Äìpiperonyl butoxide combination net, against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes in southern Benin. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 104: 758-765. Valuable horses in areas infested with Culicoides midges or Simulium black-flies can be protected with commercially available shields made of cloth that fit over head, neck and back. Flies such as the Musca, Stomoxys, and Haematobia species have larval habitats amongst livestock dung and soiled bedding found around livestock farms. There is scope for reducing fly infestation by clearing these wastes to composting containers or areas. However, for many types of dipteran flies, the larvae inhabit areas such as bogs (Culicoides), swamps (mosquitoes), or rivers (Simulium) that are impractical to treat under typical commercial constraints within agriculture. = Chemical repellents and insecticides, and botanical preparations= Target to control Glossina tsetse-flies; colors of cloth attract flies and cloth is treated with insecticide, brown bottle at top right of target contains an odor attractant. Synthetic chemicals such as diethyltoluamide (often called DEET) dissolved in an oily carrier are sometimes used. Also there are various organic, botanical repellents such as citronella oil and neem oil. Typically various types of synthetic pyrethroids such as deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin are formulated in an oil or watery suspension suitable for application direct to the skin of animals at risk.C. F. Curtis, C.F. & Davies, C.R. (2001) Present use of pesticides for vector and allergen control and future requirements. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 15: 231-235. DOI: 10.1046/j.1365-2915.2001.00293.x This is usually done with a pour-on applicator along the back line of the host from where the insecticide spreads downwards through the hair coat.Wardhaugh, K.G. (2005) Insecticidal activity of synthetic pyrethroids, organophosphates, insect growth regulators, and other livestock parasiticides: An Australian perspective. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 24: 789-796. DOI: 10.1897/03-588.1 s In addition, to protect against flies such as Stomoxys and Glossina species that feed on legs and belly the insecticide can be sprayed selectively to those regions. Also, cattle can be treated using self-applicators such as back-rubbers made of large bundles of fiber impregnated with the insecticide, or in automatic walk-through sprayers. The same types of insecticides are also formulated into the plastic sheet of ear tags for protecting cattle against Musca and similar flies feeding around the head of cattle.Drummond, R.O. (1988) Control of arthropod pests of livestock: a review of technology. Boca Raton, CRC Press. Insect growth regulators (juvenile hormones, chitin synthesis inhibitors, etc.) are available. For example, the insect growth regulator cyromazine is effective for the prevention or treatment of infestations with blowfly larvae. Botanical extracts such as azadirachtin from the neem tree can be formulated as repellents and insecticides, with the potential advantage of more rapid degradation to harmless forms in the environment, lower toxicity and potentially lower cost.Geden, C.J. (2012) Status of biopesticides for control of house flies. Journal of Biopesticides, 5: 1-11. = Traps and targets= These can contribute to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass and the structure of the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in.Ashworth, J.R. & Wall, R. (1994) Responses of the sheep blowflies Lucilia sericata and L.cuprina to odour and the development of semiochemical baits. Medical and Veterinary Entomology, 8: 303-309. Horse- flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area-wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a rectangle of dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host.Hargrove, J.W. et al. (1995) Catches of tsetse (Glossina spp.) (Diptera: Glossinidae) from traps and targets baited with large doses of natural and synthetic host odour, Bulletin of Entomological Research, 85: 215-227. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth. = Sterile insect technique= This technique was used to eradicate Cochliomyia hominivorax screw-worm fly from the USA where the flies were endemic, and from Libya where there had been an accidental importation from South America. Although this species of blowfly under natural conditions has larvae of the obligate myiasis type, it is possible to colonize the entire lifecycle in large factory conditions. Massive numbers of pupae are sterilized by irradiation. When released, these flies mate with the wild flies and the matings produce no offspring. The reproductive rate of the wild flies can be reduced to the level of eradication. Eradication schemes are being extended in the Americas.Bush, G. L., & Neck, R. W.
