In October 1918, Arab rebels, under Hashemite Emir Faisal, captured Damascus during the British-backed Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Faisal then formed a government under the auspices of the Allied military occupation administration of \\"OETA East\\", consistent with an earlier Anglo-French agreement. The French encountered local revolts when their forces entered the country, and in March 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of Syria. A month later, the League of Nations allocated Syria to France as a mandate. The Battle of Maysalun ensued as French forces set out from Lebanon to assert control over Damascus and topple Faisal's government. With remnants of the Syrian army and local volunteers, Faisal's war minister, General Yusuf al- Azma, set out to confront them. The better-equipped French troops, led by General Mariano Goybet, defeated al-Azma, who was killed in action. The French entered Damascus the following day, encountering little resistance. Soon afterward, Faisal was expelled from Syria. Despite the Syrian army's decisive defeat, the battle is viewed in Syria and the rest of the Arab world as a symbol of courageous resistance against a stronger, imperial power. Background On 30 October 1918, towards the end of World War I, the Sharifian Army led by Emir Faisal, backed by the British Army, captured Damascus from the Ottomans as part of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The war ended less than a month after the Sharifian‚ÄìBritish conquest of Damascus. In correspondences between the Sharifian leadership in Mecca and Henry McMahon, the British high commissioner in Cairo, the latter promised to support the establishment of a Sharifian kingdom in the Arab provinces of the Ottoman Empire in return for launching a revolt against the Ottomans.Allawi 2014, pp. 60‚Äì61. However, the British and French governments secretly made previous arrangements regarding the division of the Ottomans' Arab provinces between themselves in the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement. King Faisal (center) and War Minister Yusuf al-Azma (left, in front of Faisal), 1920 To ensure his throne in Syria, Faisal attended the January 1919 Paris Conference, where he was not recognized by the French government as the sovereign ruler of Syria; Faisal called for Syrian sovereignty under his rule,Moubayed 2012, pp. 8‚Äì9. but the European powers attending the conference called for European mandates to be established over the former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire.Moubayed 2012, p. 14. In the US-led June 1919 King‚ÄìCrane Commission, which published its conclusions in 1922, the commission determined that the people of Syria overwhelmingly rejected French rule. Furthermore, Emir Faisal stated to the commission that \\"French rule would mean certain death to Syrians as a distinguished people\\".Moubayed 2012, p. 16. French forces commanded by General Henri Gouraud landed in Beirut on 18 November 1919, with the ultimate goal of bringing all of Syria under French control. Shortly thereafter, French forces deployed to the Beqaa Valley between Beirut and Damascus. Against King Faisal's wishes, his delegate to General Gouraud, Nuri al-Said, agreed to the French deployment and the disbandment of Arab troops from al-Mu'allaqa, near Zahle. The agreement between al-Said and Gouraud was contrary to an earlier agreement Faisal had made with French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau, which held that French troops would not deploy in the Beqaa Valley until the League of Nations ruled on the matter. Faisal condemned al-Said and accused of him of treachery. Following the Arab Army withdrawal from al-Mu'allaqa, Christian militiamen from Zahle raided the town, prompting attacks from local Muslim militiamen, which forced several Christian families to the coast. Amid these developments, armed groups of rebels and bandits emerged throughout the Beqaa Valley. When a French officer in Baalbek was assaulted by Shia Muslim rebels opposed to the French presence, Gouraud held the Arab government responsible and demanded that it apologize, which it did not. In response, Gouraud violated his agreement with al-Said and occupied Baalbek. The French deployment along the Syrian coast and the Beqaa Valley provoked unrest throughout Syria and sharpened political divisions between the political camp calling for confronting the French and the camp preferring compromise.Allawi, 2014, p. 285. On 8 March 1920, the Syrian National Congress proclaimed the establishment of the Kingdom of Syria, with Faisal as king.Baker 1979, p. 161. This unilateral action was immediately rejected by the British and French.Baker 1979, p. 162. In the San Remo Conference, which was called by the Allied Powers in April 1920, the allocation of mandates in the Arab territories was finalized, with France given a mandate over Syria.Baker 1979, p. 163. France's allocation of Syria was, in turn, repudiated by Faisal and the Syrian National Congress. After months of instability and failure to make good on the promises Faisal had made to the French, General Gouraud gave an ultimatum to Faisal on 14 July 1920 demanding that he disband the Arab Army and submit to French authority by 20 July or face a French military invasion.Moubayed 2006, p. 44.Tauber 1995, p. 215. On 18 July, Faisal and the entire cabinet, with the exception of War Minister Yusuf al-Azma, agreed to the ultimatum and issued disbandment orders for the Arab Army units at Anjar, the Beirut‚ÄìDamascus road and the hills of the Anti-Lebanon Mountains overlooking the Beqaa Valley.Allawi 2014, p. 288. Two days later, Faisal informed the French liaison in Damascus of his acceptance of the ultimatum, but for unclear reasons, Faisal's notification did not reach Gouraud until 21 July. Sources suspicious of French intentions accused the French of intentionally delaying delivery of the notice to give Gouraud an official excuse for advancing on Damascus.Tauber 2013, p. 34. However, there has been no evidence or indication of French sabotage. News of the disbandment and Faisal's submission led to riots in Damascus on 20 July and their suppression by Emir Zeid, which led to around 200 deaths.Allawi 2014, p. 289. Al-Azma, who staunchly opposed surrender, implored Faisal to allow him and the remnants of his army to confront the French.Moubayed 2006, p. 45. =Prelude= On 22 July, Faisal dispatched Education Minister Sati al-Husri and the Arab government's former Beirut representative, Jamil al-Ulshi, to meet Gouraud at his headquarters in Aley and persuade him to end his army's advance to Damascus. Gouraud responded by extending the ultimatum by one day and with new, more stringent conditions, namely that France be allowed to establish a mission in Damascus to supervise the implementation of the original ultimatum and the establishment of the French mandate. Al-Husri returned to Damascus the same day to communicate Gouraud's message to Faisal, who called for a meeting of the cabinet on 23 July to consider the new ultimatum. Colonel Cousse, a French liaison officer to Damascus, interrupted the meeting with a demand from Gouraud that the French army be allowed to advance toward Maysalun, where water wells were abundant.Allawi 2014, p. 290. Gouraud had originally planned to launch the offensive against Damascus from Ayn al-Judaydah,Russell 1985, p. 187. a spring in the Anti-Lebanon Range,Russel 1985, p. 186. but the lack of water sources there amid the steep, barren mountains led to a change of plans. Accordingly, Gouraud sought to occupy Khan Maysalun, an isolated caravanserai on the Beirut‚ÄìDamascus road situated at the crest of the Wadi al-Qarn mountain pass in the Anti-Lebanon, located west of Damascus. Gouraud was also motivated to occupy Khan Maysalun because of its proximity to the Hejaz Railway.Russel 1985, p. 246. Cousse's message confirmed the fears of Faisal's cabinet that Gouraud was intent on taking over Syria by force. The cabinet subsequently rejected Gouraud's ultimatum and issued a largely symbolic appeal to the international community to end the French advance. On 23 July, al-Azma set out from Damascus with his motley force of army regulars and volunteers, which was divided into northern, central and southern columns each headed by camel cavalry units.Tauber 1995, p. 218. French forces launched their offensive towards Khan Maysalun and Wadi al-Qarn shortly after dawn on 24 July, at 5:00, while Syrian forces were waiting at their positions overlooking the low end of Wadi al-Qarn.Russell 1985, p. 189. Combatants and arms =French forces= General Mariano Goybet commanded French forces during the battle Estimates of the combined size of the French Army of the Levant forces that participated in the battle ranged from 9,000 to 12,000 troops. The troops were mostly made up of Senegalese and Algerian units, and consisted of ten infantry battalions and a number of cavalry and artillery units. Among the participating units were the 415th Infantry Regiment, the 2nd Algerian Riflemen Regiment, the Senegalese Division, the African Riflemen Regiment and the Moroccan Sipahi Battalion.Husri 1966, p. 172. A number of Maronite volunteers from Mount Lebanon reportedly joined the French forces as well. The Army of the Levant was equipped with plain and mountain artillery batteries and 155mm guns, and backed by tanks and fighter bombers. The commander of the French forces was General Mariano Goybet. =Syrian forces= Syrian forces consisted of remnants of the Arab Army assembled by General al-Azma, including soldiers from General Hassan al-Hindi's disbanded Anjar-based garrison, disbanded units from Damascus and Bedouin camel cavalry; most Arab Army units had been disbanded days prior to the battle by order of King Faisal as part of his acceptance of General Gouraud's terms. In addition to Arab Army troops, numerous civilian volunteers and militiamen from Damascus joined al-Azma's forces. Estimates put the number of Syrian soldiers and irregulars at around 4,000, while historian Eliezer Tauber asserts that al-Azma recruited 3,000 soldiers and volunteers, of whom only 1,400 participated in the battle.Tauber 1995, p. 216. According to historian Michael Provence, the \\"quarters of Damascus had been emptied of young men as crowds walked west, some armed only with swords or sticks, to meet the mechanized French column\\".Provence 2011, p. 218. Commander of the Syrian forces at Maysalun, War Minister Yusuf al-Azma died during the battle. Part of the civilian militia units were assembled and led by Yasin Kiwan, a Damascene merchant, Abd al-Qadir Kiwan, the former imam of the Umayyad Mosque, and Shaykh Hamdi al-Juwajani, a Muslim scholar. Yasin and Abd al-Qadir were killed during the battle.Gelvin 1998, p. 115. Shaykh Muhammad al-Ashmar also participated in the battle with 40‚Äì50 of his men from the Midan quarter of Damascus. Other Muslim preachers and scholars from Damascus, including Tawfiq al-Darra (ex-mufti of the Ottoman Fifth Army), Sa'id al-Barhani (preacher at the Tuba Mosque), Muhammad al-Fahl (scholar from the Qalbaqjiyya Madrasa) and Ali Daqqar (preacher at the Sinan Pasha Mosque) also participated in the battle.Gelvin 1998, pp. 115‚Äì116. The Syrians were equipped with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and those used by the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. The Syrians also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery pieces. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120‚Äì250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50‚Äì80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other. Battle The first clashes took place at 6:30 when French tanks stormed the central position of the Syrian defensive line while French cavalry and infantry units assaulted the Syrians' northern and southern positions.Allawi 2014, p. 290. The camel cavalry were the first Syrian units to engage the French. Syrian forces initially put up stiff resistance along the front,Allawi 2014, p. 291. but lacked coordination between their different units. Early in the clashes, Syrian artillery fire inflicted casualties on a battery of French soldiers. French tanks faced heavy fire as they attempted to gain ground against the Syrians. However, French artillery took a toll on Syrian forces and by 8:30 the French had broken the Syrians' central trench. At one point in the first few hours of the clashes, Syrian forces managed to briefly pin down two Senegalese companies that were relatively isolated on the French right flank. The losses inflicted on the two Senegalese units represented roughly half of the French army's total casualties. Nonetheless, by 10:00, the battle was effectively over, having turned decisively in favor of the French. At 10:30, French forces reached al-Azma's headquarters, unhindered by the mines laid en route by the Syrians. Little information is known about the battle from the Syrian side. According to one version, when French forces were about 100 meters in the distance, al-Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed near him and demanded him to open fire. However, before any shells could be fired, a French tank unit spotted al-Azma and gunned him down by machine gun. In another account, al-Azma had attempted to mine the trenches as the French forces approached his position, but was shot down by the French before he could set off the charges. Al-Azma's death marked the end of the battle, although intermittent clashes continued until 13:30. Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the French as they retreated toward Damascus. After the battle, General Gouraud addressed General Goybet as follows: > GENERAL ORDER No. 22 > Aley, 24 July 1920 > :\\"The General is deeply happy to address his congratulations to General > Goybet and his valiant troops: 415th of line, 2nd Algerian sharpshooters, > 11th and 10th Senegalese sharpshooters, light-infantry-men of Africa, > Moroccan trooper regiment, batteries of African groups, batteries of 155, > 314, company of tanks, bombardment groups and squadrons who in the hard > fight of 24 of July, have broken the resistance of the enemy who defied us > for 8 months ... They have engraved a glorious page in the history of our > country.\\" ‚Äì General Gouraud Aftermath King Faisal was expelled from Syria by the French following their occupation of Damascus Initial estimates of the casualties which claimed 2,000 Syrian dead and 800 French casualties turned out to be exaggerated. The French Army claimed 42 of its soldiers were killed, 152 wounded and 14 missing in action, while around 150 Syrian fighters were killed and 1,500 wounded. King Faisal observed the battle unfold from the village of al-Hamah, and as it became apparent that the Syrians had been routed, he and his cabinet, with the exception of Interior Minister 'Ala al-Din al-Durubi, who had quietly secured a deal with the French, departed for al-Kiswah, a town located at the southern approaches of Damascus. French forces had captured Aleppo on 23 July without a fight, and after their victory at Maysalun, French troops besieged and captured Damascus on 25 July. Within a short time, the majority of Faisal's forces fled or surrendered to the French, although parties of Arab groups opposed to French rule continued to resist before being quickly defeated. King Faisal returned to Damascus on 25 July and asked al-Durubi to form a government, although al-Durubi had already decided on the composition of his cabinet, which was confirmed by the French. General Gouraud condemned Faisal's rule in Syria, accusing him of having \\"dragged the country to within an inch of destruction\\", and stating that because of this, it was \\"utterly impossible for him to remain in the country\\".Allawi 2014, p. 292. Faisal denounced Gouraud's statement and insisted that he remained the sovereign head of Syria whose authority he was \\"granted by the Syrian people\\". Although he verbally dismissed the French order expelling him and his family from Syria, Faisal departed Damascus on 27 July with only one of his cabinet members, al-Husri. He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders.Allawi 2014, p. 293. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria.Allawi 2014, p. 294. Legacy The French took control of the territory that became the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon. France divided Syria into smaller statelets centered on certain regions and sects, including Greater Lebanon for the Maronites, Jabal al-Druze State for the Druze in Hauran, the Alawite State for the Alawites in the Syrian coastal mountains and the states of Damascus and Aleppo.McHugo 2013, p. 122. Gouraud reportedly went to the tomb of Saladin, kicked it, and said: Although the Syrians were decisively defeated, the Battle of Maysalun \\"has gone down in Arab history as a synonym for heroism and hopeless courage against huge odds, as well as for treachery and betrayal\\", according to Iraqi historian Ali al-Allawi. According to British journalist Robert Fisk, the Battle of Maysalun was \\"a struggle which every Syrian learns at school but about which almost every Westerner is ignorant\\".Fisk 2007, p. 1003. Historian Tareq Y. Ismael wrote that following the battle, the \\"Syrian resistance at Khan Maysalun soon took on epic proportions. It was viewed as an Arab attempt to stop the imperial avalanche.\\" He also states that the Syrians' defeat caused popular attitudes in the Arab world that exist until the present day which hold that the Western world dishonors the commitments it makes to the Arab people and \\"oppresses anyone who stands in the way of its imperial designs.\\"Ismael 2014, p. 57. Sati' al- Husri, a major pan-Arabist thinker, asserted that the battle was \\"one of the most important events in the modern history of the Arab nation.\\"Sorek 2015, p. 32. The event is annually commemorated by Syrians, during which thousands visit the grave of al-Azma in Maysalun. References Bibliography    *  Further reading  *Moubayed, Sami M.

Common names are Errinundra plum-pine and mountain plum-pine (though it is neither a pine nor a plum). It grows on exposed sites to 1,800 m, often forming living carpets over rocks through wind pruning. Mountain plum-pine can live up to 600 years, and the growth rings vary with the temperature of the growing season, with narrower rings indicating unusually snowy years. These factors make it useful for determining past climate conditions in the Australian Alps. Description The leaves are 1 cm long and 2‚Äì3 mm broad, green, often reddish-tinted, particularly so in cold winter weather. It has small bright red berry-like cones, with a 5‚Äì10 mm long red aril and one (rarely two) apical seeds 6‚Äì8 mm long; they are eaten by birds and marsupials, but are toxic to most other mammals (including humans). Whilst it is normally low growing, rarely reaching more than 1 m in the Australian Alps, on the Errinundra Plateau in eastern Victoria it reaches 15 m in height. The timber is too rare to be used for woodcrafts. Cultivation Mountain plum-pine is tolerant of quite dry conditions and can resprout after losing all its leaves from drought. It survives ‚àí16 ¬∞C to 45 ¬∞C and grows well in full sun or fairly heavy shade. It is slow growing, putting on about 3‚Äì5 cm of length each year. It can be grown from cuttings or seed. New foliage is usually a lime green, darkening to olive green as it hardens. Ideally the mountain plum-pine should be grown in full sunlight with plenty of water. It makes a good indoor plant in a bright window. It is an excellent bonsai or hedging plant, although it does require patience. References External links *Farjon, A. 2001.

As of February 2018, it consists of seven lines that cross the city and connects with other forms of transit, such as the Mexico City Metro. The most recent line to open was line 7, running for the first time double-decker buses along the city's iconic boulevard, Paseo de la Reforma. In 2016, Metrob√∫s carried on average 1,152,603 passengers on weekdays.  Impact  Line 1 replaced 372 standard buses and microbuses that served Avenida de los Insurgentes with 212 articulated buses that run at an average speed of , doing as maximum. Doing so, travel times along the corridor were reduced up to 50%. Besides addressing the bus service problem, the BRT Metrob√∫s project emerged in the context of the city's efforts to reduce air pollution with a program called Proaire 2002‚Äì2010.

During the early months of the system's operations, limited availability of the cards required a temporary method for access to the system involving purchasing a normal single-trip paper ticket at a cost of MXN$4.50. Starting in October 2005, and with smartcard supply able to cover the demand, access is done exclusively by using the card. As of 2014, the single-trip cost is MXN$6.00 (USD$). A new MB smartcard, preloaded with one voyage, can be purchased for MXN$16.00 and \\"recharged\\" for MXN$6.00 per trip. There is a supplemental fee of MXN$30.00 for trips to or from the airport. The smartcard system has generated controversy, especially from occasional and one-time users who complain about the MXN$16.00 fee for a single-voyage card, for this is common that sometimes people ask others who have the smartcard to charge for them a trip. Service is free for those over 70 years old, or disabled, as well as for children under 5 accompanied by an adult. Lines and hours =Line 1= The line starts at Metro Indios Verdes, a large multimodal transport node in the Gustavo A. Madero borough. From there it runs south, through Cuauht√©moc and Benito Ju√°rez, before terminating in the La Joya district of Tlalpan borough, providing a total of 45 stations. It was built in two sections, with a split at Metro Insurgentes, the notional dividing point between the avenue's northern and southern stretches, just south of where Avenida Insurgentes intersects with Paseo de la Reforma. The first line covers a distance of up to , running in a dedicated bus lane built within the central reservation (median) of Avenida de los Insurgentes. Avenida Insurgentes is one of the city's main north‚Äìsouth arterial routes, constitutes a section of the Pan-American Highway, and is reputed to be the longest urban avenue in the world. System map On its route south from Indios Verdes, the Metrob√∫s also connects with Metro stations at Deportivo 18 de Marzo, Potrero, La Raza, Buenavista, Revoluci√≥n, Insurgentes, and Chilpancingo, providing connections with Metro Lines 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9. The proposed southward extension of Mexico City Metro Line 7 will also enable that line to connect at the Metrob√∫s' original southernmost station, Doctor G√°lvez. The first metrobus service began along the northernmost portion of Line 1 on 19 June 2005. Initial service was from Metro Indios Verdes south to Metro Insurgentes. This was quickly followed by a southward expansion from Metro Insurgentes to MB station Doctor G√°lvez, bringing the line length up to . Many of the stations along Line 1 feature cantilevered glass canopies designed by architect Carlos Monge. The original Line 1 was expanded with the inclusion of nine new stations in order to achieve full coverage of Avenida Insurgentes. The southward expansion of service along Line 1 started service on 13 March 2008 and brought the line's length up to . =Line 2= MB station Xola under construction near the intersection of Eje Central and Eje 4 Sur; 25 August 2008 Line 2 runs along Eje 4 Sur from Tacubaya in the west, where there is a connection to the Metro Tacubaya station; via Etiop√≠a, Patriotismo and crossing Line 1 (Insurgentes) at Nuevo Le√≥n, to Tepalcates in the east, where there is a connection to the Metro Tepalcates station. The line opened on 16 December 2009. = Line 3 = Line 3 runs from Tenayuca northwest of the city southward to Etiop√≠a II, where there is connection to Metrob√∫s Line 2 as well as the Metro Etiop√≠a station. According to the Mexican newspaper, El Universal, construction of the first of L√≠nea 3 (line 3) began on 5 March 2010 and was scheduled to end in April 2011. However, service along Line 3 started on 8 February 2011. During construction, for every tree taken down three were planted, for a total of 1,546 trees planted. In addition, it was estimated that Line 3 will carry 100,000 passengers per day. Travel time will be reduced by up to 40%. Line 3 opened on 8 February 2011. = Line 4 = Line 4 runs from Buenavista railway station in the west of the city eastward towards Mexico City International Airport. In late 2010 the Head of Government of the Federal District Marcelo Ebrard announced a plan to build the new line. Construction on Line 4 started on 4 July 2011, although the start of construction was met with some protest from residents and business owners along the proposed route. Line 4 included a two-step construction process with the first operational segment built between Buenavista and Metro San L√°zaro. An extension provides travel between San L√°zaro and the airport. Instead of travelling along a single avenue or axis road, Line 4 traffic circulates around the Centro Hist√≥rico. To navigate the turns and narrow streets in and near the Centro Hist√≥rico, Line 4 uses light buses instead of the articulated buses used on the other lines in the system.

Clonkeen College has approximately 550 students and 35 teaching staff. Edward Melly is the principal and Michael Brennan is the Deputy Principal. The school has strong links with charities and the developing world. Clonkeen underwent significant development between the years 2015 ‚Äì 2018. History The Ordnance Survey Ireland map 1837‚Äì1842 shows Clonkeen School Ho[use], located in the present day Cornelscourt Village. Although the same building appears on the OSI 1888‚Äì1913 map, it is not named as a school any more. The original junior school was St. Joseph's Private Preparatory School, built in September 1965 close to where the present Clonkeen College stands. It was run by a staff of three Christian Brothers until the school was closed in 1975. The secondary school was also called St. Joseph's, until renamed Clonkeen College. The present school stands on the site of Charles Stewart Parnell‚Äôs second last public meeting. The first pupils to the current school were admitted in the autumn of 1970, there was one fifth year and two third year classes (there was no fourth year then). Thirteen students completed the first Leaving Certificate. The school principal was Br. Jo Hogan; other original teachers were Br. Collins and Mr. B. Toomey. The school was officially opened by David Andrews TD on 31 January 1972.

Classes have visited Greece, the Aran Islands, Paris, Venice, Madrid, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Lake Garda. During the year the students have the opportunity to do courses such as: Self- defense, ECDL, Gaelic football, FAI coaching, and Sailing. New subjects in the transition year are cooking, music, effective communication, German, Japanese and technical drawing. The students have an opportunity to attain a Gaisce\\\\Presidents Award. Students visit educational and historical sites like Christchurch, St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, and Glendalough, Croke Park, Kilmainham Gaol and the National Art Gallery. Every few years, the opportunity arrises for Transition Years to do a musical. The most recent musical was conducted showing of Buggsy Malone in 2018. Clonkeen Student Council Students have input into the schools running in the form of a Student Council of class representatives from all years, who are elected by their peers. Since its inception, the Clonkeen College Student Council has shown a large involvement in the running of the school. The council meets weekly to discuss projects or issues. The council is composed of twenty four Prefects. Prefects carry out a variety of tasks and act as the link between the students and the management of the school. Each year the council focuses on one major project. In the past they have had water fountains installed in the junior and senior corridors; more recently they had formal shoes and school jackets introduced to the uniform. Annually, the Council, in conjunction with the Parents Council and the Cluny Student Council, organise a \\"Ball in the Hall\\" to welcome Clonkeen's new first year students. Council meetings are chaired by the chairman and the Secretary takes minutes. A Councillor's term of office runs from December of their election to December of the following year. The only exception is with the 1st year representatives who will be allowed until Halloween to settle into the secondary school life. Social Events The First Year Social, or \\"Ball in the Hall\\", is a disco for the first year students of Clonkeen College and St. Joseph of Cluny, Killiney girls' school. The Social Committee contact and work with the Cluny Student Council and jointly organise and run the ball, liaising with the principals and Parents Councils. Every September, past pupils and friends of the school are invited to a \\"Golf Day\\" (and night).

Weinhard moved to Philadelphia where he worked for a year in the brewing business before moving west to Cincinnati, Ohio. After two years there, he moved southwest to St. Louis, Missouri, where he stayed until 1856. During this time in America, he worked as a brewer for others while preparing his own beer recipes. Oregon In 1856, Weinhard moved to California and settled briefly in Sacramento. The next year in March, he relocated to Vancouver in the Washington Territory, where he began working at a brewery owned by John Meunich and helped construct a new brewery. Weinhard worked there for six months and then founded a brewery with George Bottler across the Columbia River in Portland, Oregon. This partnership did not last long and he sold out to Bottler and returned to working for Meunich. Weinhard bought Meunich's business in 1859 and named it the Vancouver Brewery. In 1862, Weinhard bought the Henry Saxer Brewery in Portland and then partnered with Bottler again to build a new brewery in today's Northwest Portland. That year he also moved permanently to Portland; he sold his Vancouver operations in 1864 and bought out Bottler of his share of the business in 1866. Weinhard also bought Portland's oldest brewery, the Liberty Brewery, and continued expansion of the Portland operations, then called the City Brewery. By 1890, the brewery was the largest in the Pacific Northwest and had grown from producing 2,000 barrels per year to 40,000 barrels that year. Later years and family Weinhard's grave marker with bottle caps In 1859, Weinhard married Louisa Wagenblast, and they had two daughters. A Mason, he was also a member of several German societies in Portland. This included helping to found the Portland German Aid Society, with other civic activities including providing funds to build a church adjacent to the brewery. Other business interests outside of the brewery included stakes in the Portland Hotel, the West Side Railway, and the New Grand Central Hotel. In 1887, Weinhard offered to pump free beer into the Skidmore Fountain for its dedication; the city declined the offer due to the fear of rowdy horses. Weinhard died in Portland at age 74 and was buried in its River View Cemetery. The brewery he built remained in operation for another 95 years, until 1999.

The event was recorded in contemporary Chinese astronomy, and references to it are also found in a later (13th-century) Japanese document, and in a document from the Islamic World. Furthermore, there are a number of proposed, but doubtful, references from European sources recorded in the 15th century, and perhaps a pictograph associated with the Ancestral Puebloan culture found near the Pe√±asco Blanco site in New Mexico, United States. The remnant of SN 1054, which consists of debris ejected during the explosion, is known as the Crab Nebula. It is located in the sky near the star Zeta Tauri (Œ∂ Tauri). The core of the exploding star formed a pulsar, called the Crab Pulsar (or PSR B0531+21). The nebula and the pulsar that it contains are some of the most studied astronomical objects outside the Solar System. It is one of the few Galactic supernovae where the date of the explosion is well known. The two objects are the most luminous in their respective categories. For these reasons, and because of the important role it has repeatedly played in the modern era, SN 1054 is one of the best known supernovae in the history of astronomy. The Crab Nebula is easily observed by amateur astronomers thanks to its brightness, and was also catalogued early on by professional astronomers, long before its true nature was understood and identified. When the French astronomer Charles Messier watched for the return of Halley's Comet in 1758, he confused the nebula for the comet, as he was unaware of the former's existence. Motivated by this error, he created his catalogue of non-cometary nebulous objects, the Messier Catalogue, to avoid such mistakes in the future. The nebula is catalogued as the first Messier object, or M1.  Identification of the supernova  The Crab Nebula was identified as the supernova remnant of SN 1054 between 1921 and 1942, at first speculatively (1920s), with some plausibility by 1939, and beyond reasonable doubt by Jan Oort in 1942. In 1921, Carl Otto Lampland was the first to announce that he had seen changes in the structure of the Crab Nebula. This announcement occurred at a time when the nature of the nebulae in the sky was completely unknown. Their nature, size and distance were subject to debate. Observing changes in such objects allows astronomers to determine whether their spatial extension is \\"small\\" or \\"large\\", in the sense that notable fluctuations to an object as vast as our Milky Way cannot be seen over a small time period, such as a few years, whereas such substantial changes are possible if the size of the object does not exceed a diameter of a few light- years. Lampland's comments were confirmed some weeks later by John Charles Duncan, an astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory. He benefited from photographic material obtained with equipment and emulsions that had not changed since 1909; as a result the comparison with older snapshots was easy and emphasized a general expansion of the cloud. The points were moving away from the centre, and did so faster as they got further from it. Also in 1921, Knut Lundmark compiled the data for the \\"guest stars\\" mentioned in the Chinese chronicles known in the West. He based this on older works, having analysed various sources such as the Wenxian Tongkao, studied for the first time from an astronomical perspective by Jean-Baptiste Biot in the middle of the 19th century. Lundmark gives a list of 60 suspected novae, then the generic term for a stellar explosion, in fact covering what is now understood as two distinct phenomena, novae and supernovae. The nova of 1054, already mentioned by the Biots in 1843,√âdouard Biot, \\"Catalogue des √©toiles extraordinaires observ√©es en Chine depuis les temps anciens jusqu‚Äô√† l‚Äôan 1203 de notre √®re\\", published in Connaissance des temps ou des mouvements c√©lestes, √† l‚Äôusage des astronomes et des navigateurs, pour l‚Äôan 1846. 1843. is part of the list. It stipulates the location of this guest star in a note at the bottom of the page as being \\"close to NGC 1952\\", one of the names for the Crab Nebula, but it does not seem to create an explicit link between them. In 1928, Edwin Hubble was the first to note that the changing aspect of the Crab Nebula, which was growing bigger in size, suggests that it is the remains of a stellar explosion. He realised that the apparent speed of change in its size signifies that the explosion which it comes from occurred only nine centuries ago, which puts the date of the explosion in the period covered by Lundmark's compilation. He also noted that the only possible nova in the region of the Taurus constellation (where the cloud is located) is that of 1054, whose age is estimated to correspond to an explosion dating from the start of the second millennium. Hubble therefore deduced, correctly, that this cloud was the remains of the explosion which was observed by Chinese astronomers. Hubble's comment remained relatively unknown as the physical phenomenon of the explosion was not known at the time. Eleven years later, when the fact that supernovae are very bright phenomena was highlighted by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky and when their nature was suggested by Zwicky, Nicholas Mayall proposed that the star of 1054 was actually a supernova, based on the speed of expansion of the cloud, measured by spectroscopy, which allows astronomers to determine its physical size and distance, which he estimated at 5000 light- years. This was under the assumption that the velocities of expansion along the line of sight and perpendicularly to it were identical. Based on the reference to the brightness of the star which featured in the first documents discovered in 1934, he deduced that it was a supernova rather than a nova. This deduction was subsequently refined, which pushed Mayall and Jan Oort in 1942 to analyse historic accounts relating to the guest star more closely (see below). These new accounts, globally and mutually concordant, confirm the initial conclusions by Mayall and Oort in 1939 and the identification of the guest star of 1054 is established beyond all reasonable doubt. Most other historical supernovas are not confirmed so conclusively: supernovas of the first millennium (SN 185, SN 386 and SN 393) are established on the basis of a single document each, and so they cannot be confirmed; in relation to the supposed historical supernova which followed the one in 1054, SN 1181, there are legitimate doubts concerning the proposed remnant (3C58) and an object of less than 1000 years of age. Other historical supernovae of which there are written accounts which precede the invention of the telescope (SN 1006, SN 1572 and SN 1604) are however established with certitude. Telescope-era supernovae are of course associated with their remnant, when one is observed, with full certitude, but none is known within the Milky Way.  Historical records  The Crab Nebula is a remnant of an exploded star. This is the Crab Nebula in various energy bands, including a hard X-ray image from the HEFT data taken during its 2005 observation run. Each image is 6' wide. guest star reported by Chinese astronomers in 1054 is identified as SN 1054. The highlighted passages refer to the supernova. SN 1054 is one of eight supernovae in the Milky Way that can be identified because written testimony describing the explosion has survived. In the nineteenth century, astronomers began to take an interest in the historic records. They compiled and examined the records as part of their research on recent novae, comets, and later, the supernovae. The first people to attempt a systematic compilation of records from China were the father and son Biot. In 1843, the sinologist √âdouard Biot translated for his father, the astronomer Jean-Baptiste Biot, passages from the astronomical treatise of the 348-volume Chinese encyclopaedia, the Wenxian Tongkao. Almost 80 years later, in 1921, Knut Lundmark undertook a similar effort based on a greater number of sources. In 1942, Jan Oort, convinced that the Crab Nebula was the \\"guest star\\" of 1054 described by the Chinese, asked sinologist J.J.L. Duyvendak to help him compile new evidence on the observation of the event. = Chinese astronomy = Simulated image of supernova SN 1054 at the position of modern Crab Nebula, as presumably would have been observed from capital of Song Dynasty at Kaifeng, China during the morning of 1054. Star-like objects that appeared temporarily in the sky were generically called \\"guest stars\\" (k√® xƒ´ng ÂÆ¢Êòü) by Chinese astronomers. The guest star of 1054 occurred during the reign of the Emperor Renzong of the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279). The relevant year is recorded in Chinese documents as \\"the first year of the Zhihe era\\". Zhihe was an era name used during the reign of Emperor Renzong, and corresponds to the years 1054‚Äì1056 C.E., so the first year of the Zhihe era corresponds to the year 1054 C.E. Some of the Chinese accounts are well preserved and detailed. The oldest and most detailed accounts are from Song Huiyao and Song Shi, historiographical works of which the extant text was redacted perhaps within a few decades of the event. There are also some later records, redacted in the 13th century, which are not necessarily independent of the older ones. Three accounts are apparently related because they describe the angular distance from the guest star to Zeta Tauri as \\"perhaps several inches away\\", but they are in apparent disagreement about the date of appearance of the star. The older two mention the day jichou Â∑±‰∏ë, but the third, the Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, the day yichou ‰πô‰∏ë. These terms refer to the Chinese sexagenary cycle, corresponding to numbers 26 and 2 of the cycle, which corresponds, in the context where they are cited, respectively, to 4 July and 10 June. As the redaction of the third source is of considerably later date (1280) and the two characters are similar, this is easily explained as a transcription error, the historical date being jichou Â∑±‰∏ë, 4 July. The description of the guest star's location as \\"to the south-east of Tianguan, perhaps several inches away\\" has perplexed modern astronomers, because the Crab Nebula is not situated in the south-east, but to the north- west of Zeta Tauri. The duration of visibility is explicitly mentioned in chapter 12 of Song Shi, and slightly less accurately, in the Song Huiyao. The last sighting was on 6 April 1056, after a total period of visibility of 642 days. This duration is supported by the Song Shi. According to the Song Huiyao the visibility of the guest star was for only 23 days, but this is after mentioning visibility during daylight. This period of 23 days applies in all likelihood solely to visibility during the day.  Sources  The Song Huiyao (literally \\"Collected important documents of the Song dynasty\\") covers the period 960‚Äì1220. Huiyao is a traditional form of history books in China which aimed mainly to preserve primary sources, and as such are important sources supplementing the official Twenty-Four Histories. The Song dynasty had a specific government department dedicated to compiling the Huiyao, and some 2,200 volumes were published in ten batches during the Song dynasty. However, most of these documents were lost by the time of the Qing Dynasty except for the synopsis and a relatively small portion preserved as part of the imperial Yongle Encyclopedia. In 1809, the portion preserved in the Yongle Encyclopedia was extracted and re-published as the Song Huiyao Jigao (the \\"draft extract of the Song Huiyao\\"). Subsequent scholars have worked on the project further and the current edition dates from 1936. This document recounts the observation of the guest star, focusing on the astrological aspect but also giving important information on the visibility of the star, by day and by night. The Song Shi is the official annals of the Song dynasty. Chapter 12 mentions the guest star, not its appearance but rather the moment of its disappearance. The corresponding entry dated 6 April 1056 indicates: In chapter 56 (\\"Astronomical treaty\\") of the same document, the guest star is again mentioned in a chapter dedicated to this type of phenomenon, this time focusing on its appearance, The Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian (\\"Long compilation of the continuation of the Zizhi Tongjian\\"), a book covering the period of 960‚Äì1126 and written 40 years or so later by Li Tao (1114‚Äì1183), contains the oldest Chinese testimonies relating to the observation of the star. It was rediscovered in 1970 by the specialist in Chinese civilisations Ho Peng Yoke and collaborators. It is relatively imprecise in the case of the explosion of SN 1054. A loose translation of what was stated: There is an account of the star from the Liao Dynasty, which ruled in the area around northeast China from 907‚Äì1125. The book in question, the Qidan Guo Zhi, was compiled by Ye Longli in 1247. It includes various astronomical notes, some of which are clearly copied from the Song Shi. This entry referring to the star of 1054 seems unique: The account of Qidan Guo Zhi alluded to the notable astronomical events that preceded the death of King Xingzong. Various historical documents allow us to establish the date of death of the Emperor Xingzong as 28 August 1055, during the eighth lunar month of the twenty-fourth (and not twenty-third) year of his reign. The dates of the two astronomical events mentioned (the eclipse and the appearance of the guest star) are not specified, but were probably before the obituary (2 or 3 years at most). Two solar eclipses were visible shortly before that date in the Khitan kingdom, on 13 November 1053 and 10 May 1054. Of these, only one occurred around noon, that of 13 November; it seems likely that this is what the document mentions. As for the guest star, only a rough estimate of location is given, corresponding to the moon mansion Mao. This mansion is situated just east of where the star appeared, as mentioned in the other testimonies. Since no other known significant astronomical event occurred in this region of the sky during the two years that preceded the death of Xingzong, it seems likely that the text is actually referring to the star of 1054. The Wenxian Tongkao is the first East Asian source that came to the attention of Western astronomers; it was translated by √âdouard Biot in 1843. This source, compiled by Ma Duanlin in 1280, is relatively brief. The text is very close to that of the Song Shi:  Identity of Tianguan The asterisms (or \\"constellations\\") of Chinese astronomy were catalogued around the 2nd century BC. The asterisms with the brightest stars in the sky were compiled in a work called Shi Shi, which also includes Tianguan. Identification of Tianguan is comparatively easy, as it is indicated that it is located at the foot of the Five Chariots asterism, the nature of which is left in hardly any doubt by representation on maps of the Chinese sky: it consists of a large pentagon containing the bright stars of the Auriga. As Tianguan is also represented to the north of the Three Stars asterism, the composition of which is well known, corresponding to the bright stars of Orion, its possible localisation is strongly restricted to the immediate proximity of the star Œ∂ Tauri, located between \\"Five Chariots\\" and \\"Three Stars\\". This star, of medium brightness (apparent magnitude of 3.3), is the only star of its level of brightness in this area of the sky (there is no other star that is brighter than an apparent magnitude of 4.5 within 7 degrees of Œ∂ Tauri), and therefore the only one likely to figure among the asterisms of \\"Shi Shi\\". All of these elements, along with some others, allow \\"Tianguan\\" to be confirmed beyond reasonable doubt as corresponding to the star Œ∂ Tauri. Northeast region of the Taurus constellation, with Œ∂ and Œ≤ Tauri stars and the location of the supernova of 1054 between them (M1).  Position relative to Tianguan  Three Chinese documents indicate that the guest star was located \\"perhaps a few inches\\" South-East of Tianguan. Song Shi and Song Huiyao stipulate that it \\"was standing guard\\" for the asterism, corresponding to the star Œ∂ Tauri. The \\"South-East\\" orientation has a simple astronomical meaning, the celestial sphere having, like the Earth's globe, both north and south celestial poles, the \\"South-East\\" direction thus corresponding to a \\"bottom- left\\" location in relation to the reference object (in this case, the star Œ∂ Tauri) when it appears at the South. However, this \\"South-East\\" direction has long left modern astronomers perplexed in the context of this event: the logical remnant of the supernova corresponding to the guest star is the Crab Nebula, but it is not situated to the southeast of Œ∂ Tauri, rather in the opposite direction, to the northwest. The term \\"perhaps a few inches\\" (ke shu cun in the Latin transliteration) is relatively uncommon in Chinese astronomical documents. The first term, ke, is translated as \\"approximately\\" or \\"perhaps\\", the latter being currently preferred. The second term, shu, means \\"several\\", and more specifically any number between 3 and 9 (limits included). Finally, cun resembles a unit of measurement for angles translated by the term \\"inch\\". It is part of a group of three angular units, zhang (also written chang), chi (\\"foot\\") and cun (\\"inch\\"). Different astronomical documents indicate without much possible discussion that a zhang corresponds to ten chi, and that one chi corresponds to ten cun. The angular units are not the ones used to determine stars' coordinates, which are given in terms of du, an angular unit corresponding to the average angular distance travelled by the sun per day, which corresponds to around 360/365.25 degrees, in other words almost one degree. The use of different angular units can be surprising, but it is similar to the current situation in modern astronomy, where the angular unit used to measure angular distances between two points is certainly the same as for declination (the degree), but is different for right ascension (which is expressed in angular hours; an angular hour corresponds to exactly 15 degrees). In Chinese astronomy, right ascension and declination have the same unit, which is not the one used for other angular distances. The reason for this choice to use different units in the Chinese world is not well known. = Meaning of units = However, the exact value of these new units (zhang, chi and cun) was never stipulated, but can be deduced by the context in which they are used. For example, the spectacular passing of Halley's comet in 837 indicates that the tail of the comet measured 8 zhang. Even if it is not possible to know the angular size of the comet at the time it passed, it is certain that 8 zhang correspond to 180 degrees at the most (maximum visible angle on the celestial sphere), which means that one zhang can hardly exceed 20 degrees, and therefore one cun cannot exceed 0.2 degrees. A more rigorous estimation was made from 1972 on the basis of references of minimal separations expressed in chi or cun between two stars in the case of various conjunctions. The results suggest that one cun is between 0.1 and 0.2 degrees and that one chi is between 0.44 and 2.8 degrees, a range which is compatible with the estimations for one cun. A more solid estimation error is that it is generally accepted that one chi is in the order of one degree (or one du), and that one cun is in the order of one tenth of a degree. The expression \\"perhaps a few inches\\" therefore suggests an angular distance in the order of one degree or less. = Problems with description = If all the available elements strongly suggest that the star of 1054 was a supernova, and that in the area next to where the star was seen, there is a remnant of a supernova which has all of the characteristics expected of an object that is around 1000 years old, a major problem arises: the new star is described as being to the South-East of Tianguan, while the Crab Nebula is to the North-East. This problem has been known since the 1940s and has long been unsolved. In 1972 for example, Ho Peng Yoke and his colleagues suggested that the Crab Nebula was not the product of the explosion of 1054, but that the true remnant was to the South-East, as indicated in several Chinese sources. For this, they envisaged that the angular unit cun corresponds to a considerable angle of 1 or 2 degrees, meaning that the distance from the remnant to Œ∂ Tauri was therefore considerable. Aside from the fact that this theory does not account for the large angular sizes of certain comets, expressed in zhang, it comes up against the fact that there it does not make sense to measure the gap between a guest star and a star located so far away from it, when there are closer asterisms that could be used. In their controversial article (see above) Collins and his colleagues make another suggestion: on the morning of 4 July, the star Œ∂ Tauri was not bright enough and too low on the horizon to be visible. If the guest star, which was located close to it, was visible, it is only because its brightness was comparable to Venus. However, there was another star, brighter and higher on the horizon, which was possibly visible, for reference: Beta Tauri (Œ≤ Tauri). This star is located at around 8 degrees north-north-west of Œ∂ Tauri. The Crab Nebula is south-south-east of Œ≤ Tauri. Collins et al. suggest therefore that at the time of its discovery, the star was seen to the south-east of Œ≤ Tauri, and that as the days passed and visibility improved, astronomers were able to see that it was in fact a lot closer to Œ∂ Tauri, but that the direction \\"south-east\\" used for the first star was kept in error. The solution to this problem was suggested (without proof) by A. Breen and D. McCarthy in 1995. and proved very convincingly by D. A. Green et F. R. Stephenson (2003) The term \\"stand on guard\\" obviously signifies a proximity between the two stars, but also means a general orientation: a guest star \\"standing on guard\\" for a fixed star is systematically located below it. In order to support this theory, Green and Stephenson investigated other entries in Song Shi, which also includes reference to \\"standing on guard\\". They selected entries relating to conjunctions betweens the stars identified and planets, of which the trajectory can be calculated without difficulty and with great precision on the indicated dates. Of the 18 conjunctions analysed, spreading from 1172 (the Jupiter‚ÄìRegulus conjunction on 5 December) to 1245 (the Saturn‚ÄìGamma Virginis conjunction on 17 May), the planet was more to the north (in the sense of a lower declination) in 15 cases, and in the three remaining cases, it was never in the south quadrant of the star. In addition, Stephenson and Clark (1977) had already highlighted such an inversion of direction in a planetary conjunction: on 13 September 1253, an entry in the astronomical report Koryo-sa indicated that Mars had hidden the star to the south-east of the twenty-eight mansions sign Ghost (Delta Cancri), while in reality, it approached the star north-west of the asterism (Eta Cancri). = Meigetsuki (Japan)= The oldest and most detailed record from Japan is in the Meigetsuki, the diary of Fujiwara no Teika (1162‚Äì1241), a poet and courtier. There are two other Japanese documents, presumably dependent on the Meigetsuki: *The 14th century Ichidai Yoki: The description is very similar to the Meigetsuki, omitting several details (hour of apparition, and possibly erroneous parts of the lunar month). The short text also contains many typographical errors. *The 17th-century Dainihonshi, containing very little information. The brevity contrasts with the more detailed descriptions of \\"guest stars\\" (supernovas) of 1006 and 1181. The Meigetsuki places the event in the fourth lunar moon, one month earlier than the Chinese texts. Whatever the exact date during this month, there seems to be a contradiction between this period and the observation of the guest star: the star was close to the sun, making daytime and nighttime observation impossible. The visibility in daylight as described by the Chinese texts is thus validated by the Japanese documents, and is consistent with a period of moderate visibility, which implies that the star's period of diurnal visibility was very short. In contrast, the day of the cycle given in the Chinese documents is compatible with the months that they state, reinforcing the idea that the month on the Japanese document is incorrect. The study of other medieval supernovas (SN 1006 and SN 1181) reveals a proximity in the dates of discovery of a guest star in China and Japan, although clearly based on different sources. Fujiwara no Teika's interest in the guest star seems to have come accidentally whilst observing a comet in December 1230, which prompted him to search for evidence of past guest stars, among those SN 1054 (as well as SN 1006 and SN 1181, the two other historic supernovas from the early second millennium). The entry relating to SN 1054 can be translated as: The source used by Fujiwara no Teika is the records of Yasutoshi Abe (Onmy≈çd≈ç doctor), but it seems to have been based, for all the astronomical events he has recorded, on documents of Japanese origin. The date he gives is prior to the third part of ten days of the lunar month mentioned, which corresponds to the period of between 30 May and 8 June 1054 of the Julian calendar, which is around one month earlier than Chinese documentation. This difference is usually attributed to an error in the lunar months (fourth place and fifth place). The location of the guest star, clearly straddling the moon mansions Shen and Zuixi, corresponds to what would be expected of a star appearing in the immediate vicinity of Tianguan. =Ibn Butlan (Iraq)= While SN 1006, which was significantly brighter than SN 1054, was mentioned by several Arab chroniclers, there exist no Arabic reports relating to the rather faint SN 1181. Only one Arabic account has been found concerning SN 1054, whose brightness is between those of the last two stars mentioned. This account, discovered in 1978, is that of a Nestorian Christian doctor, Ibn Butlan, transcribed in the Uyun al-Anba, a book on detailed biographies of physicians in the Islamic World compiled by Ibn Abi Usaybi'a (1194‚Äì1270) in the mid-thirteenth century. This is a translation of the passage in question: The three years cited (AH 445, 446, 447) refer, respectively, to: 23 April 1053 ‚Äì 11 April 1054, 12 April 1054 ‚Äì 1 April 1055, and 2 April 1055 ‚Äì 20 March 1056. There is an apparent inconsistency in the year of occurrence of the star, first announced as 446, then 445. This problem is solved by reading other entries in the book, which quite explicitly specify that the Nile was low at 446. This year of the Muslim calendar ran from 12 April 1054 to 1 April 1055, which is compatible with the appearance of the star in July 1054, as its location (admittedly rather vague), is in the astrological sign of Gemini (which, due to axial precession, covers the eastern part of the Constellation Taurus). The date of the event in 446 is harder to determine, but the reference to the level of the Nile refers to the period preceding its annual flood, which happens during the summer. = Suggested European sightings = Henry before Tivoli pointing up at a new star. Since 1980, several European documents have been identified as possible observations of the supernova.L. P. Williams, The Supernova of 1054: A Medieval Mystery. In H. Woolf (ed.), The Analytic Spirit: Essays in the History of Science in Honor of Henry Guerlac, Cornell University Press, Ithaca (1981), , pp. 329‚Äì349 The first such suggestion was made in 1980 by Umberto Dall'Olmo (1925‚Äì1980). The following passage which reports an astronomical sighting is taken from an account compiled by Jacobus Malvecius in the 15th century: The date this passage refers to is not explicit, however, and by means of a reference to an earthquake in Brescia 11 April 1064, it would seem ten years too late, attributed by Dall'Olmo to a transcription error. Another candidate is the Cronaca Rampona, proposed in 1981, which however also indicates a date several years after the event, in 1058 instead of 1054. The European candidate documents are all very imprecise, and remain unconvincing from an astronomical perspective even when collated; they would be impossible to interpret in the sense of an observation of a supernova if no information had been preserved from the Chinese accounts. Conversely, the lack of accounts from European chroniclers has long raised questions. In fact, it is known that the supernova of 1006 was recorded in a large number of European documents, albeit not in astronomical terms. Among the proposed explanations for the lack of European accounts of SN 1054, its concurrence with the East-West Schism is prominent.See the references in Collins et al. (1999) In fact, the date of the excommunication of the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius (16 July) corresponds to the star reaching its maximum brightness and being visible in the daytime. Among the six proposed European documents, one does not seem to correspond to the year of the supernova (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius). Another (the Cronaca Rampona) has large dating and internal coherence problems. The four others are relatively precisely dated, but contradict the Chinese documents: they date from Spring and not Summer 1054, that is to say before the conjunction between the supernova and the sun. Three of the documents (the chronicle of Jacobus Malvecius, the Cronaca Rampona and the Armenian chronicle) make reference relatively explicitly to conjunctions between the moon and stars, of which one is identified (Jupiter, in the Armenian chronicle). The three other documents are very unclear and have almost unusable astronomical content. In 1999, George W. Collins and his colleagues defended the plausibility of European sighting of SN 1054. They argue that the records suggest that European sightings even predate Chinese and Japanese reports by more than two months (April 1054). These authors emphasize the problems associated with the Chinese reports, especially the position of the supernova relative to Zeta Tauri. They also adduce a Khitan document which they suggest might establish observation of the supernova at the time of the solar eclipse of 10 May 1054 (which would corrobate the \\"late\\" date of Chinese observation of the event). Conversely, they interpret the European documents, taken in conjunction, as plausibly establishing that an unusual astronomical phenomenon was visible in Europe in the spring of 1054, i.e. even before the Sun's conjunction with Zeta Tauri. They also surmise that the correct year in the report by Ibn Butlan is AH 445 (23 April 1053 - 11 April 1054) rather than AH 446 (12 April 1054 - 1 April 1055). The publication by Collins et al. was criticised by Stephenson and Green (2003). These authors insist that the problems with the Chinese and Japanese documents can easily be resolved philologically (as common copyists' mistakes) and need not indicate unreliability of the Chinese observations. Stephenson and Green condemn attempts at uncovering European sightings of the supernova as it were at any cost as suffering from confirmation bias, \\"anxious to ensure that this event was recorded by Europeans\\". They also reject the idea of the Khitan document referring to the supernova as a mistake based in a translation of the document, and as inconsistent with astronomical reality. Green and Stephenson (2003) thus argue for the standing majority consensus established by 1995, to the effect that the European documents do not offer themselves to an interpretation as sightings of SN 1054. The thesis of Collins et al. upon publication was reviewed in the magazine Ciel & Espace with some enthusiasmSerge Jodra, ¬´ Contre-enqu√™te sur la mort d'une √©toile ¬ª, Ciel & Espace No.355, 58‚Äì63 (1999). Ya√´l Naz√©, ¬´ 1054 : les myst√®res de l'√©toile invit√©e ¬ª, Public conference for an astronomy group in Spa but it has not received much attention since its rejection by Stephenson and Green (2003).The ADS database lists five citations as of 2013 (list).  The Cronaca Rampona  The account of a supernova sighting which is considered the most feasible comes from a medieval chronicle from the region of Bologna, the Cronaca Rampona. This text, a subject of astronomers' attention since 1972, was interpreted as a possible sighting of the supernova in 1981, and again in 1999. The part of the chronicle that was highlighted translates to: Without even discussing the last, astronomical part of the passage, skeptics point out at least two discrepancies in the following: Pope Stephen IX became Pope in 1057, not 1058, and Emperor Henry III who is mentioned, actually Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, was born in 1017, 39 and not 49 years before 1058, his reign having started in 1039 (King of the Romans, then as emperor of the Romans from 1046 after being consecrated by Pope Clement II during the course of his brief pontificate). Henry III, therefore, was dead in 1056, and his reign could not have coincided with that of Stephen IX. It seems more likely that the text was the subject of various alterations, as the date format (for example, the number 1058 is written as Ml8, with a mix of Roman and Arab characters, common in the period when the Cronaca Rampona was written (15th century) but not in the 11th century. Furthermore, associating the event described with the sighting of a supernova in 1054 would require the supposition that the Cronaca Rampona entry was in the wrong place in relation to the rest of the document, as the different entries are in chronological order and several previous entries are later than 1054 (in order, the previous entries refer to 1046, 1049, 1051, 1055, 1056, written in a mix of Arab and Roman characters, namely Mxl6, Mxl9, Mli, Mlv and Ml6). Additionally, there is a discrepancy with the date of the new moon. The term calends, which refers to the Roman calendar, can be written in the ordinary form of the Gregorian calendar, and the phase of the moon can be calculated from it. It is clear that the new moon did not occur on the thirteenth day of the Calends in any month in 1054. All of this is in strong opposition to the precision of the dates of references to eclipses in medieval European chronicles: a study of 48 partial or total solar eclipses from 733 to 1544, reveals that 42 dates out of 48 are correct, and of the six remaining, three are incorrect by one of two days and the three others give the correct day and month, but not the year.F. Richard Stephenson, Historical Eclipses and Earth's Rotation, Cambridge University Press, 1997, 573 pages, Finally, even considering that the stated event corresponds to May or June 1054 nevertheless, and describes a conjunction between the already visible supernova and the moon, another problem arises: during those months, the moon did not pass very close to the location of the supernova. Therefore, it is possible that the account describes an approach or a concealment of a planet by the moon, contemporary to the suggested date (1058). This scenario is corroborated by two contemporary documents which are perfectly dated and describe a conjunction and a planetary concealment by the moon in relatively similar terms. These two documents, unearthed by Robert Russell Newton, are taken from the Annales Cavenses, Latin chronicles from la Trinit√† della Cava (Province of Salerno). They mention \\"a bright star that entered into the circle of the (new) moon\\" for both 17 February 1086 ([Martii incipiente nocte] stella clarissima in circulum lunae primae ingressa est) and for 6 August 1096 (stella clarissima venit in circulum lunae). The first event can be verified as Venus being eclipsed by the moon, the second as the Moon passing Jupiter at a distance of less than one degree after a lunar eclipse which was also mentioned in the chronicle. Hayton of Corycus The Cronaca Rampona account is apparently also reflected in the Armenian chronicle of Hayton of Corycus (written before 1307). The relevant passage translated from the Armenian manuscript reads: Vahe Gurzadyan's proposal connecting the Hayton of Corycus's chronicle with Cronaca Rampona and SN 1054 dates to 2012. Other View of the sky at dusk on the day of the death of Pope Leo IX. The three planets Mercury, Mars, and Venus are seen together on the West-South-West horizon (at the bottom- right of the image), with Jupiter the furthest away (top right), all next to the constellation of Orion (centre-bottom) and its bright peripheral stars (notably Sirius, bottom-left, and Capella, top right). They could be \\"countless lamps\\" caused by Albertus cited in De Obitu Leonis, that the supernova had been present or not. In a work entitled De Obitu Leonis (\\"On the Death of [Pope] Leo\\") by one subdeacon Libuinus, there is a report of an unusual celestial phenomenon. A certain Albertus, leading a group of pilgrims in the region of Todi, Umbria, reportedly confirmed having seen, on the day that Pope Leo IX died, a phenomenon described as Guidoboni et al. (1994) proposed that this may relate to SN 1054, and was endorsed by Collins et al. (1999). Guidoboni et al. (1994) also proposed a Flemish text as an account of a sighting of the supernova. The text, from Saint Paul's church‚Äîno longer extant‚Äîin the Flemish town of Oudenburg, describes the death of Pope Leo IX in Spring 1054 (the date described corresponds to 14 April 1054). McCarthy and Breen (1997) proposed an extract from an Irish chronicleAnnals of the Four Masters http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100005B/ M1054.10 as a possible European sighting of the supernova. This chronicle indicates the following for 1054: The date of the event corresponds to 24 April: (Saint George's Day is 23 April and fell on a Saturday in 1054. Thus the mention of the \\"Sunday of Saint George's Day\\" corresponds to the next day, 24 April) long before the sighting noted by the Chinese. The astronomical nature of the account remains very uncertain, and interpretation as a solar halo or aurora seems at least as probable. = Suggested records in North American petroglyphs = The sky on the morning of 5 July, showing the conjunction between the supernova (blue square) and the moon. If the orientation of the phenomenon does not correspond to the petroglyph, the relative orientation of the crescent moon in relation to the star corresponds, along with the order of size of the angular distance between the two stars. Two Native American paintings in Arizona show a crescent moon located next to a circle that could represent a star. It has been proposed that this represents a conjunction between the moon and the supernova, made possible by the fact that, seen from the Earth, the supernova occurred in the path of the Ecliptic. This theory is compatible with the datings in these paintings. In fact, on the morning of 5 July, the moon was located in the immediate proximity of the supernova, which could reinforce the idea that it was this proximity that had been represented in these paintings. This interpretation cannot be confirmed. The dating of the paintings is extremely imprecise (between the 10th and 12th century), and only one of them shows the crescent moon with the correct orientation in relation to the supernova. Moreover, this type of drawing could well represent a proximity of the moon with Venus or Jupiter. Another, better known document was updated during the 1970s at the Chaco Canyon site (New Mexico), occupied around 1000 AD by the Ancestral Pueblo Peoples. On the flat underside of an overhang, it represents a hand, below which there is a crescent moon facing a star at the bottom-left. On the wall underneath the petroglyph there is a drawing which could be the core and tail of a comet. Apart from the petroglyph, which could represent the configuration of the moon and supernova on the morning of 5 July 1054, this period corresponds to the apogee of the Anasazi civilisation. It seems possible to propose an interpretation of the other petroglyph, which, if it is more recent than the other one, could possibly correspond to the passing of Halley's Comet in 1066. Although plausible, this interpretation is impossible to confirm and does not explain why it was the supernova of 1054 that was represented, rather than the supernova of 1006, which was brighter and also visible to this civilisation. = Suggested records in Aboriginal oral tradition = The Aboriginal people of the region around Ooldea have passed in oral tradition a detailed account of their mythology of the constellation Orion and the Pleiades.Daisy Bates (Australia), 1921b. The Great Plain‚Äôs Edge, The Australasian, 27 August 1921, p. 418 The anthropologist Daisy Bates was the first to attempt to compile records of this story. Work done by her and othersBerndt, R.M., 1941. Tribal Migrations and Myths Centring on Ooldea, South Australia, Oceania, 12(1), 1‚Äì20 has shown that all of the protagonists of the story of Nyeeruna and the Yugarilya correspond to individual stars covering the region around Orion and the Pleiades, with the exception of Baba, the father dingo, which is a major protagonist of the story and of the yearly re-enactments of the myth by the local people: It has been suggested by Leaman and Hamacher that the location usually assigned to Baba by the locals (recorded by Bates as being at the \\"horn of the bull\\") is more likely to correspond to SN 1054 than to a faint star of that region such as Œ≤ or Œ∂ Tauri. This is motivated by the reference to Babba \\"returning to his place again\\" after attacking Nyeeruna which could refer to a transient star, as well as the fact that important characters of the myth are associated with bright stars. However, Leaman and Hamacher clarify there is no solid evidence to support this interpretation, which remains speculative. Hamacher demonstrates the extreme difficulty in identifying supernovae in indigenous oral traditions. Other elements of the story which have been found to correspond to astronomical elements by these authors include: awareness by the Aboriginal people of the different colors of the stars, possible awareness of the variability of Betelgeuse, observations of meteors in the Orionid meteor shower and the possibility that the rite associated with the myth is held at a time of astronomical significance, corresponding to the few days in the year when due to the Sun‚Äôs proximity to Orion, it is unseen throughout the night, but is always in the sky during the daytime. Media references The supernova is mentioned in Ayreon's song To the Quasar, from the album Universal Migrator Part 2: Flight of the Migrator. The popular science book Death by Black Hole by Neil deGrasse Tyson uses SN 1054 to illustrate the relationships between religion, philosophy and human interpretations of astronomical events.

By law, companies are required to keep this list up to date to remove those directors who are deceased or resign, and to add those who have been elected by the shareholders. However, the register must also list any person who had been a director indefinitely. The record must indicate the dates a director started and stopped holding office. As directors carry certain personal legal obligations to a corporation (for example, being responsible for any money held in trust for another person, e.g. sales taxes not remitted to a government), those seeking recourse against directors are allowed to rely on the directors register as proof that a director held office on any particular day. In many jurisdictions, corporations are required to keep the list of directors up to date with the corporate affairs office where the corpororation was incorporated. This is so that both government agencies and interested third parties may be aware of the name and address of directors (for example, in order to serve a statement of claim on the corporation).

She was named for the Native American tribal leader Miantonomoh. Miantonomoh was laid down at the New York Navy Yard, Brooklyn, New York, in 1862; launched 15 August 1863; and commissioned 18 September 1865, Commander Daniel Ammen in command. Service history =North Atlantic Squadron, 1865-1870= Assigned to the North Atlantic Squadron, Miantonomoh cruised for a short time along the east coast, thence steamed to the Washington Navy Yard where she remained until April 1866. In late April she sailed to New York and there prepared for an extended cruise to European waters. Under the command of Comdr. John C. Beaumont, she sailed with steamers and on 6 May. After touching at Halifax, Nova Scotia, she reached St. John's, Newfoundland, 23 May. There she embarked the Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Gustavus Fox, who arrived 3 June en route to undertaking special assignments in Europe. Upon the order of President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles instructed Fox to deliver Alexander II, Emperor of Russia, a copy of a Joint Resolution of Congress which expressed \\"deep regret\\" at the recent attempt on the Czar's life and congratulations on his escape from harm. In addition, and of greater importance, Welles requested Fox to visit important naval stations and collect: > ... all the information that is attainable relative to the means which are > possessed by the principal naval powers for building, repairing, and laying > up naval vessels, an ... in regard to their navy yards and navy > establishments ... You should also examine some of the more modern built > naval vessels abroad; and, availing yourself of your experience ... > institute comparisons between the present naval appliances and improvements > of your own country and those of Europe ... Departing St. John's on 5 June, the three ships crossed the Atlantic in less than 11 days. Fox described the first ocean crossing of an ironclad monitor as \\"a pleasant trip.\\" During much of the voyage she was towed by Augusta \\"as a matter of convenience and precaution rather than necessity.\\" After reaching Queenstown on 16 June, Miantonomoh steamed via Portsmouth to Cherbourg, France, where Fox debarked on 29 June for talks with Napoleon III. She returned to the English coast on 7 July and a week later received visitors including British royalty, government officials, and members of the press, all of whom viewed her with wonderment and amazement. Her departure in naval design caused considerable comment in the English press, and the Times exclaimed: \\"The wolf is in our fold; the whole flock at its mercy.\\" The success of her reception in England typified her subsequent visits to other European nations during the next several months. Departing 15 July, Miantonomoh steamed to Denmark where she was inspected by King Christian IX and the royal family; thence, on 31 July, she entered the Baltic Sea en route to Russia. Eleven ships of the Russian Navy, including four monitors of the Uragan class, met her at Helsingfors (Helsinki) and escorted her to Kronshtadt3\\\\. –ì–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –ö—Ä–æ–Ω—à—Ç–∞–¥—Ç–∞ where she arrived 5 August. She remained at that important Russian naval base for more than a month. During that time she was viewed with interest and attention by the Czar, his family, and leading Russian naval officers. Commenting on the success of the naval mission to Russia, Captain Alexander Murray later wrote: > We were the victims of a hospitality which I did not believe had an > existence out of America, and ... of a generosity which does not often fall > to the lot of navy officers anywhere; ... From Russia Miantonomoh continued her triumphant visit to European ports. With Assistant Secretary Fox embarked, she visited Stockholm, Sweden, in mid- September; thence, she arrived Kiel, Prussia, 1 October amidst \\"a great number of the Prussian ships of war.\\" The monitor left Fox to complete his duties on 3 October and steamed to Hamburg where she arrived the 6th. \\"Here we remained a week,\\" wrote Captain Murray, \\"and experienced the full flood of that tide of visitors to the 'monitor' which had been increasing ever since we left the United States ... \\" Miantonomoh called at French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian ports during the next six months. Her mission of showing both the flag and herself proved wholly successful. The \\"tide of visitors,\\" reported Captain Murray, \\"wherever we went, overwhelmed us.\\" In company with Augusta, Miantonomoh departed Gibraltar on 15 May 1867. Steaming via the Canary and Cape Verde. Islands, Caribbean ports and the Bahamas, she anchored off League Island, Philadelphia, 22 July, thus completing a cruise of more than 17,700 miles. Captain Murray concluded his report to Secretary of the Navy Welles: \\"The vessels themselves [are] in such a condition as to be readily enabled to repeat the service just performed.\\" Miantonomoh, however, decommissioned at Philadelphia 26 July 1867 and was laid up at League Island. Miantonomoh recommissioned 15 November 1869, Comdr. R. W. Shufeldt in command. She steamed to New England and served with the funeral fleet that escorted the British ship HMS Monarch carrying the body of George Peabody, noted American philanthropist, back to Massachusetts for burial. She continued her operations in the North Atlantic station until 28 July 1870 when she decommissioned at Boston. =Reconstruction, 1874= As part of Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson's ambitious plans to overhaul and modernize ships of the Navy, Miantonomoh was taken to Chester, Pennsylvania, in 1874, ostensibly for \\"repairs\\" at the yard of John Roach. On 23 June 1874 Congress authorized funds for the purpose of \\"completing the repairs\\" of four double-turreted monitors including Miantonomoh. However, the \\"repairs\\" consisted of the constructing of new vessels under the guise of repairing the old ones. She was broken up in 1875 and but few of her materials were used in the building of the larger, more heavily armored, iron-hulled \\"New Navy\\" monitor which became the second Miantonomoh.

In this sense, it is no different from first-party coverage. The term \\"no-fault\\" is most commonly used in the context of state or provincial automobile insurance laws in the United States, Canada, and Australia, wherein a policyholder and their passengers are reimbursed by the policyholder's own insurance company without proof of fault, and are restricted in their right to seek recovery through the civil-justice system for losses caused by other parties. No-fault insurance has the goal of lowering premium costs by avoiding expensive litigation over the causes of the collision, while providing quick payments for injuries or loss of property. Description No-fault systems generally exempt individuals from the usual liability for causing bodily injury if they do so in a car collision; when individuals purchase \\"liability\\" insurance under those regimes, the insurance covers bodily injury to the insured party and their passengers in a car collision, regardless of which party would be liable under ordinary legal tort rules. No-fault systems often grant \\"set\\" or \\"fixed\\" compensation for certain injuries regardless of the unique aspects of the injury or the injured party. Workers' compensation funds typically are run as no-fault systems, usually with a fixed schedule for compensation for various injuries. Proponents of no-fault insurance argue that automobile collisions are inevitable and that at-fault drivers are not necessarily higher risk and should not necessarily be punished; moreover, they note that the presence of liability insurance insulates reckless or negligent drivers from financial disincentives of litigation; also, uninsured motorists often can't and won't end up paying for their liability, so in regions with many uninsured motorists, no-fault systems may make more sense; furthermore, traditional insurance is regressive because drivers of inexpensive cars are liable for damage to any car, no matter its value, even though they themselves add only a small amount of liability to the pool with their less valuable cars. This issue is fixed under a no-fault regime. Critics of no-fault argue that dangerous drivers not paying for the damage they cause encourages risky behavior, with only raised premiums and a higher risk rating as the potential consequence, and no jury awards or legal settlements. Detractors of no-fault also point out that legitimate victims with subtle handicaps find it difficult to seek recovery under no-fault. Another criticism is that some no-fault jurisdictions have among the highest automobile-insurance premiums in the country, but this may be more a matter of effect than cause: the financial savings from no-fault may simply make it more popular in areas with higher automobile-collision risk, or high insurance rates may cause more drivers to go uninsured, increasing the attraction of a no-fault system. Origins The number of traffic accidents causing fatalities and debilitating injuries had become by the mid-1960s the source of a litigation explosion that was \\"straining (and in some areas overwhelming) the judicial machinery.\\" Much legal thinking in academia was devoted to the question of whether the tort system should be replaced with another method of allocating risks of loss from accidents.See, e.g., Empirical analyses were published showing the financial impact of automobile accidents.See, e.g., The first comprehensive legislative proposal was put forward by Professors Robert E. Keeton of Harvard Law School and Jeffrey O'Connell, then of the University of Illinois, in a law review article published in the Harvard Law Review, which consisted of two chapters of the book that they would publish the following year. The Keeton-O'Connell plan provided that all automobile owners would be required to purchase a new form of insurance, called \\"basic protection coverage,\\" under which a victim has recourse for his net economic loss against the insurer of his own car, his host's car or, if the victim is a pedestrian, any car involved. Fault is not required to be shown except for of damages in excess of $10,000 for bodily injury, the deductible of $100 for bodily injury and property damage. Recoverable loss under this type of policy does not include pain and suffering and is reduced by damages recovered form other sources. The proposal generated immense discussion in legal and insurance publications with some concluding it was too \\"revolutionary.\\" In 1967 Massachusetts state representative Michael Dukakis, a 1960 graduate of Harvard Law School, introduced a modified version of the Keeton-O'Connell plan in the Massachusetts legislature. The scheme was adopted in 1970. The law was challenged in court for claimed violations of numerous state and federal constitutional provisions. The scheme was defended by the state attorney general and also Harvard Law School professors Archibald Cox and Philip Heymann in an amicus curiae brief. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts overruled the objections in a unanimous decision.Pinnick v. Cleary, 360 Mass. 1, 271 N.E.2d 592 (1971). The decision opened the way for widespread adoption of no-fault automobile insurance schemes, a development that was encouraged by the federal Department of Transportation. Overview in United States Most U.S. states have a \\"traditional tort\\" liability system for auto insurance in which recovery is governed by principles of provable negligence. However, twelve U.S. states and the Commonwealth territory of Puerto Rico require policyholders to operate under a \\"no-fault\\" scheme in which individuals injured in automobile collisions are limited in their ability to seek recovery from other drivers or vehicle owners involved in a collision.Is no-fault insurance finished? An additional 8 states have an \\"add-on\\" system in which the insured party retains the right to sue. In 2012, RAND Corporation published a study which found that costs were higher in no- fault systems.Anderson et al. (2012). What Happened to No-Fault Automobile Insurance?. RAND Corporation. In the case of economic (medical and wage-loss) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek recovery only for damages that are not covered by available first-party insurance benefits. In the case of non-economic (pain-and-suffering) damages, most no-fault systems permit injured parties to seek compensation only in cases of exceptionally \\"serious\\" injury, which can be defined in either of two ways: * A quantitative monetary threshold that sets a specific dollar (or other currency) amount that must be spent on medical bills before a tort is allowed. Disadvantages of this threshold are: (1) that it can encourage insured parties (and their medical providers) to exaggerate medical costs through over- utilization, and (2) that, unless indexed, it can become ineffective over time because of inflationary effects on medical costs. * A qualitative verbal threshold that states what categories of injuries are considered sufficiently serious to permit a tort (e.g., death, or permanent disability or disfigurement). The advantage of the verbal threshold is that it removes any incentive to inflate damage amounts artificially to meet some preset monetary loss figure. The primary disadvantage is that seriously injured claimants may be barred from compensation where their injury does not match their state's threshold definition language. In three U.S. states ‚Äì Kentucky, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania ‚Äì policyholders are permitted to choose between traditional tort and no-fault recovery regimes. Under such systems, known as \\"choice\\" or \\"optional\\" no-fault, policyholders must select between \\"full tort‚Äù and \\"limited tort\\" (no-fault) options at the time the policy is written or renewed; once the policy terms are set forth an insured party may not change his/her mind without rewriting the policy. In both Kentucky and New Jersey, policyholders who do not make an affirmative choice in favor of either full tort or limited tort are assigned the no-fault option, while in Pennsylvania the full-tort option is the default. 24 states originally enacted no-fault laws in some form between 1970 and 1975; several of them have repealed their no-fault laws over time. Colorado repealed its no-fault system in 2003. Florida's no-fault system sunsetted on 1 October 2007, but the Florida legislature passed a new no-fault law which took effect 1 January 2008. Michigan, which has had the highest auto insurance rates since 2015, has proposed legislative changes several times since 2018 in hopes of making a more affordable system, but none has passed into law. In terms of damages to vehicles and their contents, those claims are still based on fault. No-fault systems focus solely on issues of compensation for bodily injury, and such policies pay the medical bills for drivers and their companions no matter whose fault the collision was.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 20, 2001. In the episode, Homer refuses to pay a five dollar airport tax to fly to Delaware, which forces the family to ride in a livestock car of a train instead. There they meet a singing hobo who tells three tall tales which include Homer as Paul Bunyan, Lisa as Connie Appleseed (a female version of Johnny Appleseed) and Bart and Nelson as Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn respectively. \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" was directed by Bob Anderson and written by John Frink, Don Payne, Bob Bendetson and Matt Selman. The idea for the episode was pitched while the series' staff were coming up with story ideas for the twelfth season. The staff had noticed that viewers responded well to \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", and decided to write another trilogy episode because of the warm response. The singing hobo in the episode was voiced by Hank Azaria. He would originally be voiced by Jim Carrey, but he dropped out due to his busy schedule. In its original broadcast, the episode was seen by approximately 7.8 million viewers, finishing in 33rd place in the ratings the week it aired. Following its home video release, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. Plot After the Simpsons win a trip to Delaware, Homer refuses to pay a $5 airport tax for his flight. After Homer violates the Anti-Fist Shaking Law, the family jumps onto a freight train where they meet a singing hobo who tells them three stories. =Paul Bunyan= Homer portrays Paul Bunyan, a giant who quickly becomes a great burden on the local townspeople, as he crushes their houses and greedily eats all their food. Eventually, the townspeople drug him and drag him out of their town. Out of loneliness, Bunyan carves a block of stone from the mountains into a blue ox that he calls Babe, who is rendered alive by an electric shock. In his travels with Babe, Homer creates several landmarks. Bunyan later meets a young woman, Marge, and though she is initially frightened of him, the two fall in love. When a meteor is soon to hit the town, the townspeople call Paul back to help them. Paul obliges and throws the meteor towards Chicago, starting the Great Fire there, but not before it hits him in the backside. After the hobo has told this story, he asks them for a sponge bath as compensation. Disgusted, Homer is forced to oblige, as nobody else will do so, but the hobo does not mind anyone seeing his nakedness. =Connie Appleseed= The hobo's second tall tale revolves around Lisa as Connie. Connie is part of a wagon train, and all of the travelers shoot and eat buffalo. Connie, who is against the practice, tries to urge them to stop slaughter or they will wipe out the buffalo, to much ridicule. She worries that no one is eating a renewable source of food and finds some apples for the pioneers to eat, but they reject them. Eventually, she changes her last name to \\"Appleseed\\", and leaves her family to journey across the United States and plant apple seeds wherever she goes. Meanwhile, the Simpsons change their surname to \\"Bufflekill\\" and they succeed in killing all the buffalo in the land. The travelers eventually starve, and just as they are about to cannibalize Homer, Connie returns and offers them apples instead. Won over by the taste of apples, they agree to the trade, sparing Homer. =Tom and Huck= The hobo's third tale tells the story of Tom Sawyer (Bart) and Huckleberry Finn (Nelson). Tom is a rebellious trouble maker while Huck is a bully. Huck is caught holding hands with Becky (Lisa) after he falls over in her garden from the fence and is forced to marry her by her father, Homer. During the ceremony, Huck switches places with a pig and goes on the run with Tom, leaving Missouri for Missoura. However, they are chased by townspeople led by Becky's father and their families. Huck and Tom flee to a river boat, but are thrown into the Mississippi River and are caught by the townspeople. The townspeople take them back to town and execute them before lowering their bodies into coffins. =Conclusion= The family arrives in Delaware and disembarks the train, but the hobo reminds them that they owe him one more sponge bath as compensation. Homer volunteers to stay behind to do the dirty work and promises to catch up with them in Wilmington. Production On April 4, 1999, \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\" aired in the United States. The episode, which contains three self-contained segments in which the Simpsons play different characters from the Bible, was written after Fox requested a Bible-themed episode that would air on Easter. The Simpsons' staff enjoyed writing the episode and it was generally well received by viewers. When pitching stories for the twelfth season, the writers decided to make another episode based around three segments that are all related to a certain theme. \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" was written by Matt Selman, John Frink, Don Payne, and Bob Bendetson. The idea for a trilogy episode based on tall tales was pitched by Frink and Payne, according to co-executive producer Ian Maxtone-Graham.Maxtone-Graham, Ian. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. While the episode's introduction was written and conceived by Selman,Selman, Matt. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. the first segment was written by Frink and Payne. The second and third segments were written by Bendetson and Selman respectively. Writing segments for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" was much different from normal episodes; for example, the writers only had one day to outline each segment's plot, and three to four days to write the first draft of each script, which is much less time than the writers usually get for an episode. Still, Selman has said that working on the episode was \\"very fun\\" for the writers. While writing the third segment, Selman listened to Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer Abroad and Tom Sawyer, Detective on tape to \\"get some of the lingo\\" that Mark Twain used in his books. He found so many unusual words in the books that he compiled a \\"giant\\" list of them. \\"We wanted to cram in every single [jargon from the books] as we could\\", Selman said in the episode's DVD commentary. \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" was directed by Bob Anderson and is one of his favorite episodes that he directed. Because the segments take place in different places and time periods, the animators had to create new designs for characters and backgrounds. Even though it took a lot of work, Anderson maintained that the episode was \\"fun to work on.\\" In a scene in the episode, Moe holds a giant pill that makes Homer fall asleep - at one point in the episode's production, the pill would read \\"Roofie\\", but it was eventually removed. Another scene that changed during production was the scene in which Homer uses Marge's hair to clean him up for their date. After he takes Marge's hair out of his ear, her hair would originally be covered with earwax, but it was removed when the animators looked over the episode's storyboard.Anderson, Bob. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The second segment originally had many more shots of buffalo being shot, but some were changed so that the deaths were off-camera. The singing hobo was voiced by regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices Moe and Comic Book Guy among other characters in the series. Originally, the part would be played by Canadian-American actor and comedian Jim Carrey, who had asked for a role in an episode. Because Carrey was busy with other projects and did not have time to record any lines, the role was instead given to Azaria, who Scully said did a \\"great job\\". While most of the hobo's songs were written by Frink, the song that the hobo sings at the beginning of the episode was written by executive producer and former showrunner Mike Reiss. The dialog between Homer and the hobo at the end of the episode was ad-libbed by Azaria and Dan Castellaneta, who portrays Homer in the series. Like many other trilogy episodes, \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" ended up very long and the staff were obliged to cut some scenes in order to fit with the program's maximum running time. The scene in which Homer first meets Babe was also cut short; originally, it would show Babe kicking Homer in the crotch after Homer says that he will \\"whip [Babe] from dawn to dusk.\\" A similar joke was later used in The Simpsons Movie. The last removed scene was from the episode's third segment. It would show Lenny and Carl eating buffalo meat, while Carl speaks like a stereotypical Native American.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Deleted Scenes\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Cultural references \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" has been described as a \\"skewed\\" retelling of old tales. The beginning of the episode shows the family winning a trip to Delaware. This is a reference to the end of \\"Behind the Laughter\\", in which Homer is seen watching an episode of The Simpsons wherein the family is visiting Delaware. The first segment is based on the mythological lumberjack Paul Bunyan, who carved Babe the Blue ox out of the Blue Mountains. The second segment shows Lisa as Connie Appleseed, a female version of the American pioneer nurseryman Johnny Appleseed who introduced apple trees to large parts of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. \\"Tom and Huck\\" features Bart as Tom Sawyer and Nelson as Huckleberry Finn, both of whom are characters in Mark Twain's 1876 novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Despite the episode's title, only the first two segments are actually tall tales. This is referenced in the episode, when Lisa says \\"That's not tall tale, it's a book by Mark Twain.\\" In the first segment, Paul Bunyan and Babe fight Rodan, a fictional Japanese mutated pterosaur introduced in the 1956 tokusatsu film Rodan. When showering Marge with stuffed animals, Bunyan accidentally drops a guard next to her. When noticing the guard, Bunyan tugs his collar in a similar way as American comedian Charles Nelson Reilly.Gammill, Tom. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the third segment, Dr Hibbert can be heard singing the 1927 song \\"Ol' Man River\\". Reception In order to boost ratings, two earlier broadcast episodes (including Treehouse of Horror XI) were shown before the episode. In its original American broadcast on May 20, 2001, \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" received a 7.6 rating, according to Nielsen Media Research, translating to approximately 7.8 million viewers. The episode finished in 33rd place in the ratings for the week of May 14-20, 2001. On August 18, 2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, John Frink, Don Payne, Carolyn Omine, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Bob Anderson and Joel H. Cohen participated in the audio commentary for the episode.Scully, Mike. (2009). Commentary for \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Since its home video release, \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" received mixed reviews from critics. In his review of The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide disliked the episode. He argued that the episode is similar to the season 10 episode \\"Simpsons Bible Stories\\", in that they both \\"feel a little heavy on cutesy and low on comedic inspiration.\\" Although he found some parts of the episode amusing, he summarized it as overall being lackluster. DVD Talk's Casey Burchby described \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" as the season's worst episode. As with most other trilogy episodes, \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" \\"did not work\\" for Burchby, who found that the gags were either boring or too far between. He also argued that \\"Simpsons Tall Tales\\" and trilogy episodes in general are an excuse for the series' writers to not have to come up with new stories for the characters. \\"It's understandable that after eleven years, a show might have trouble continuing to come up with original material for the same five characters, but the anthology episodes come across as rather transparent attempts to avoid that challenge\\", he wrote.

The Noongar name for the plant is koolah. Description The plant is usually a shrub, not often forming a single trunk, instead growing multiple branches from around the base. It looks like a conifer, typically grows to a height of and forms clumps a few metres wide. It is dioecious and very slow-growing. The bark is thin and fibrous, green in colour turning red-brown on the outside. The leaves are needle-like, long, sharply pointed, green above and with glaucous stomatal bands beneath. The cones are berry-like, with a fleshy, edible purple aril long and one (rarely two) apical seeds 1 cm long. Distribution It grows on lower slopes and low-lying areas and around creeks in the South West and Great Southern regions of Western Australia where it grows in loamy, sandy or gravelly soils. It is associated as part of the understorey species present in lowland jarrah and karri and it spreads mostly by root suckering. The extent of occurrence of the species is less than over multiple locations. The total area of occupancy by P. drouynianus has reduced as a result of clearing of forest for pasture and the replacement of native forest with exotics. Cultivation Ideally Podocarpus drouynianus should be grown in partial shade with plenty of water. Unusually for the genus, it tolerates quite dry conditions. It survives temperatures of up to 45 ¬∞C, and grows well in full sun or partial shade. The plant grows as a rounded form in cultivation, slowly attaining two metres in height and 1.5 metres in width. Propagation from cuttings in the usual method of planting. The presentation of its red and fleshy fruit is unreliable, but the plant is favoured for its appealing foliage. The long and leafy stems are harvested for use in the florist industry. The plum-like fruit is edible, although lacking any distinctive taste, and noted as an important food of the first peoples of Southwest Australia. Classification The species was initially described by the botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1864 in his work Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae. There are two synonyms for this species: Nageia drouyniana and Podocarpus drouyniana. The species name honors the statesman Edouard Drouyn de Lhuys who was a member of the Institut de France.

Designed in response to a 1958 NATO specification as a replacement for the Lockheed P2V Neptune, Breguet's submission was declared the winner over several competing bids. To produce the Atlantic, a multinational consortium, Soci√©t√© d'√âtude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic (SECBAT), was established. During 1963, an initial order for 60 Atlantics 40 for France and 20 for Germany was received. Follow-on orders from export customers followed shortly thereafter. It was first introduced to operational service during 1965. The Atlantic has been operated by a number of countries, commonly performing maritime roles such as reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare. The Atlantic is also capable of carrying air-to-ground munitions to perform ground-attack missions; a small number of aircraft were also equipped to perform ELINT operations. An updated version, the Atlantique 2 or ATL2, was produced by Dassault Aviation for the French Navy in the 1980s. A further improved model, the Atlantique 3, was proposed during the 1990s but ultimately unbuilt. Other operators of the Atlantic have included the German Navy, the Italian Air Force, the Pakistan Navy, and the Royal Netherlands Navy. Development In 1958, NATO produced a specification for a long-range maritime patrol aircraft to replace the Lockheed P2V Neptune, with Breguet's design, the Br 1150, chosen as the winner of the competition at the end of the year. A multinational consortium, Soci√©t√© d'√âtude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic (SECBAT) was set up to develop and build the Atlantic.Air International November 1981, pp. 218, 252.Elvert, Schirmann and Lang 2008, p. 182. The first prototype made its maiden flight at Toulouse on 21 October 1961, with the second prototype flying on 25 February 1962, followed by two preproduction aircraft with a longer fuselage in February 1963 and September 1964.Air International November 1981, p. 252. Atlantic of the French Navy in service with 24 Flotille in 1973 An initial order for 60 Atlantics 40 for France and 20 for Germany was placed in 1963, with deliveries starting in 1965 and continuing to 1968. The production line had shut down by the time the Netherlands placed an order for nine Atlantics and Italy ordered eighteen. Aircraft from this second production batch were delivered from 1972 to 1974.Air International November 1981, pp. 252‚Äì253. In 1978, the French Government authorised development of a new, updated version of the Atlantic, the Atlantic Nouvelle G√©n√©ration (later known as the Atlantique 2 when orders from other nations did not occur). While the airframe and engines of the new aircraft changed little, equipment and avionics were considerably revised; these included new radar, a new sonar processor, a replacement tactical computer, and a forward-looking infrared camera turret installed under the nose. The ability to carry Exocet missiles was also added.Air International November 1981, pp. 216‚Äì218.\\"Maritime Muscle\\". Flight International, 27 June 1981. p. 2014. Two prototype Atlantique 2s were produced by converting existing Atlantics; the first of these made its maiden flight on 8 May 1981. Production of the Atlantique 2 was authorised on 24 May 1984. Deliveries started in 1989 with 28 eventually built, from an original requirement for 42.Lambert 1993, pp. 81‚Äì82.Penny, Stewart. \\"Military Aircraft Directory Part 1\\". Flight International, 4 August 1999. By 2012, the Atlantique 2 had been rebranded as the ATL2, at which point France had a total of 22 in service. In 2012, 18 French Atlantiques were undergoing a series of upgrades to increase the type's effectiveness in two stages, Phase I addressing obsolescence issues and Phase II adding new capabilities. Also in 2012, a separate project was conducted to integrate the MU90 Impact torpedo. Aircraft that received these upgrades shall have an extended service life as well, enabling Atlantique operations to be extended to around 2032.\\"France Upgrading its Atlantique Maritime Patrol Planes.\\" Defense Industry Daily, 6 October 2013. A further upgraded Atlantique 3 was proposed for the Royal Air Force's Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft (RMPA) competition, however it was withdrawn in 1996 following alleged hints from Ministry of Defence officials that the submission was unlikely to be successful; the competition later selected the BAE Systems Nimrod MRA4 instead.Barrie, Douglas and Graham Warwick. \\"Something old, something new, something borrowed ...\\" Flight International, 15 May 1996. The Atlantique 3 would have featured various off-the-shelf avionics upgrades, including the adoption of a two-man glass cockpit. The use of uprated Allison AE2100H turboprop engines to drive new Dowty-built six-bladed composite propellers reportedly would have increased power by nearly 10% and reduced fuel consumption by 15%. In late 1996, Dassault (which had merged with Breguet in the 1970s, thus acquiring the Atlantic design) intended to offer the Atlantique 3 to Germany, Italy, and France.\\"Dassault aims Atlantic at European MPA tenders.\\" Flight International, 22 May 1996. By 2005, Dassault had abandoned marketing efforts on the Atlantique 3, choosing to promote a variant of the Dassault Falcon 900 corporate jet as a maritime patrol aircraft instead.\\"Dassault offers Falcon 900 for maritime patrol.\\" Flight International, 28 June 2005. Design Cockpit of an Atlantic simulator The Breguet Br.1150 Atlantic is a twin-engined, mid-winged monoplane with a \\"double-bubble\\" fuselage; the upper lobe comprising a pressurised crew compartment, and the lower lobe housing a 9 m (27 ft 6 in) long weapons bay, with sonobuoy tubes aft of the weapons bay. A radar scanner is housed in a retractable underfuselage radome, while a magnetic anomaly detector is housed in a tail boom. It is powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Tyne turboprop engines.Air International November 1981, pp. 213‚Äì216. An all-aluminium structure is used throughout the Atlantic's airframe; corrosion is alleged to be a considerable problem due to environmental factors imposed by the maritime environment.Nicolais, Meo and Milella 2011, p. 17. The Atlantic was designed for its purpose, instead of refitting or modifying existing designs. Though the primary mission of the Atlantic is anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare, its secondary roles include search and rescue, mine laying and detection and long-range maritime surveillance.Naval Technology The Atlantic can carry either eight guided ASW torpedoes such as Mk 46 Torpedo, or 12 depth charges, or two AM.39 Exocet anti-ship missiles in its internal bomb bay. German Atlantics usually carried Mk 46s only and flew unarmed during the last years of their service. Italian Atlantics have been periodically armed with NATO-provided nuclear bombs.Harkavy 1989, p. 261. In French service, 18 modernised Atlantique ATL2 are being equipped with various new avionics and onboard sensors. Such systems include the Searchmaster derived from RBE2-AA active electronically scanned array radar developed for Dassault Rafale, new digital acoustic processing systems, a Thales-manufactured identification friend or foe system, and DCNS-developed LOTI (Logiciel Op√©rationnel de Traitement de l'Information) combat mission software. Operational history Atlantic in flight, 2006 In 1987, a single Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) Atlanique was operated by France as an airborne headquarters during Op√©ration √âpervier, the French intervention against Libyan military units which had been deployed into neighbouring Chad. Communications intercepted by the Atlantique were immediately decoded and translated before being used to conduct strikes upon Libyan forces with greater accuracy.Air and Weibes 2013, p. 325. The German Marineflieger operated a fleet of Atlantics between 1963 and 2005. A number of these aircraft were modified for SIGINT work and were based at Nordholz Naval Airbase. During the Cold War, they commonly flew across the Baltic Sea and along the border with East Germany; these flights often had American and British intelligence personnel on board in addition to their German crews. During the 1990s, Germany deployed SIGINT Atlantics to observe the United Nations embargo of Yugoslavia and for reconnaissance flights during the Kosovo War in 1999.Air and Weibes 2013, p. 134. In 1992, Germany was considering replacing its Atlantics in the maritime patrol role, the modernised Atlantic-2 was considered to be a frontrunner to be the replacement.\\"German RFP for maritime patrol is impending.\\" Flight International, 9 June 1992. In 1996, the planned procurement of a replacement was delayed in favour of a life extension program to enable the Atlantic fleet to continue in service for a further decade.\\"Dassault Aviation.\\" Flight International, 23 October 1996. Germany ultimately elected to replace its Atlantics with a number of secondhand Lockheed P-3 Orions procured from the Netherlands. Several German Atlantics have been donated to museums, including the Milit√§rhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Berlin-Gatow and the Dutch Air Force Museum, Soesterberg, Netherlands.Airforce Museum During the 1960s and 1970s, the Atlantic competed with the Lockheed P-3 Orion to be selected as the Royal Netherlands Navy's next anti-submarine aircraft. The selection process, during which Lockheed Corporation was alleged to have engaged in multiple incidents of bribery,Noonan 1987, pp. 664‚Äì665. ultimately chose the Atlantic. Fewer Atlantics were procured than originally planned however;Honig 1993, p. 194. and a total of three Atlantics out of the Netherlands' nine-strong fleet were lost through a series of failures during missions over the Atlantic Ocean. These losses resulted in the grounding of the type in 1981 and contributed to its eventual replacement by the P-3 Orion. During NATO's intervention in the 1999 Kosovo War, French Atlantics performed overflying surveillance flights of the combat area; flights within Serbian airspace were conducted by unarmed aircraft.Ripley, Tim. \\"Eagle eye on Kosovo.\\" Flight International, 3 February 1999. Atlantique flying overhead, 2006 In 1973, in the aftermath of the Indo- Pakistani War of 1971, the Pakistan Navy opted to procure three Atlantics from France.Goldrick 1997, p. 154. In 1999, a Pakistan Navy Atlantic inadvertently flew into Indian airspace while probing Indian air defenses, it being intercepted and shot down by Indian Air Force MiG-21FL after the Atlantic ignored instructions and attempts to force it to land at an Indian base; the event become known as the Atlantique incident. After 36 years of service, Pakistan's remaining Atlantics were formally retired in September 2012, following the arrival of P-3 Orions to replace them.\\"Pakistan Navy Inducts Another P-3C Orion and Phases Out Br.1150 Atlantic.\\" PTV News, 5 September 2012. In 2009, a number of French Atlantics were dispatched to Dakar, Senegal, to participate in a multinational search effort to locate the crashed Air France Flight 447.\\"Search Teams Converge on Presumed Air France Crash Zone.\\" Washington Post, 1 June 2009.\\"An Atlantic Model 2 aircraft lands at France's air base in Dakar.\\" Associated Press, 2 June 2009. In January 2013, French Navy Atlantique-2s were deployed to act as ground-strike aircraft during Operation Serval over Northern Mali; a number of laser-guided GBU-12 bombs were dropped by the Atlantiques against Malian jihadist militants seeking to overthrow the Malian government.\\"Mali : les Atlantique 2 ouvrent le feu.\\" Air & Cosmos, 31 January 2013. During the deployment, the Atlantiques also served as Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, being able to provide a sustained presence unlike alternatives such as the EADS Harfang unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).Tran, Pierre. \\"Early Lessons From France's Mali Action Emerge.\\" Defense News, 21 January 2013. In 2015, Atlantique-2s was deployed to Iraq at the beginning of Op√©ration Chammal against Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forces, initially performing ISTAR and forward air control missions. On 19 August 2015, an Atlantique-2 flew a mission with two Mirage 2000s and dropped a GBU-12 on a command and control building, its first strike mission of the operation.First Air Strike with GBU-12 Against ISIL in Iraq for French Navy ATL2 Maritime Patrol Aircraft ‚Äì Navyrecognition.com, 22 August 2015. As French military operations expanded into Syria in September 2015, the long range of the Atlantiques from their base in the UAE was utilised when undertaking reconnaissance operations instead of shorter range aircraft such as the Dassault Rafale.\\"France getting ready to bomb IS in Syria.\\" IHS Jane's 360, 7 September 2015. Variants ;Br.1150 Atlantic :Long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The series' first operators became the French and German navies who contracted for 40 and 20 Atlantics respectively through an initial batch order from Breguet in 1963. These airframes were delivered to customers beginning in 1965 and ended in 1968. A follow up order involved supply of the aircraft to the Netherlands and Italy shortly thereafter, these being delivered into 1974. Production was undertaken by a European consortium under the \\"Societe d'Etude et de Construction de Breguet Atlantic\\" (otherwise recognized as \\"SECBAT\\") name led by Breguet itself. Beyond these European powers, Pakistan received three ex- French Navy Atlantics in the 1970s. As an anti-ship, anti-submarine maritime warfare mount, the Atlantic series could be properly outfitted through torpedoes (up to 8 x Mk 46 / 7 x Murene series), depth charges, naval mines and conventional drop bombs as required - these held in the unpressurized internal bomb bay. Additionally the aircraft was cleared to drop specialized mission equipment for shipwreck. ;Atlantique 2 :Updated variant, also known as the Atlantique Nouvelle G√©n√©ration or ATL2. It is the direct descendant of the Br√©guet Atlantic. * Power for the Atlantique 2 was served through 2 x Rolls- Royce Tyne RTy.20 Mk 21 series turboprop engines (twin shaft) developing 6,100 horsepower each. * maximum speed of 400 miles per hour, * cruising speed of 200 miles per hour, * ferry range of 5,635 miles * mission endurance time of up to 18 hours * operations at altitudes from 100 feet up to 30,000 feet through use of a pressurized cabin and flight deck. * Rate-of-climb at 2,900 feet per minute. * 2 Exocet AM-39 missile were added to armament. * 6 MU90 Impact torpedo since July 2014. The ATL2 has been in service for twenty or so years, and has undergone several retrofits. A renovation operation is in progress (2019‚Äì25); 18 out of the 22 ATL2 Standard 5 operated by the French Navy are upgraded to the new version called 'Standard 6'. The upgrade is comprehensive and should allow the aircraft to operate until 2030. It includes the development of a new combat system called 'Logiciel de traitement de l'information operationelle nouvelle g√©n√©ration' (LOTI-NG). The system is used to establish a tactical picture based on data gathered by the aircraft's various sensors. New digital operator stations have replaced the original analogic equipment. Another major improvement is the upgrade of the acoustic treatment subsystem called 'Sous-syst√®me de traitement acoustique num√©rique' (STAN). This system is able to operate more sonobuoys than its predecessor and scan a broader range of frequencies. The system can also operate the most recent US sonobuoys including in the multistatic mode. The Wescam MX-20 electro-optical (EO) turret has also been integrated (the same one used on board the Boeing P-8A Poseidon). This system had already been mounted on some ATL2s. The ATL2 is frequently used in Africa where it serves as backup to ground forces. The last major element of the Standard 6 upgrade is: * New radar Thales Searchmaster Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar. According to Thales, this multirole surveillance radar offers the highest level of operational performance to detect stationary and moving maritime targets, including in high sea states, at ranges up to 200 nautical miles (air-to-sea). The French Navy will also receive a new mission preparation tool and simulator. * New Thales acoustic subsystem to gather and process signals from the latest generation air-dropped sonobuoys for submarine detection. * New navigation console designed by Dassault Aviation * New consoles for the tactical display subsystem developed by the French army, \\"SIA√©\\". * The Wescam MX-20 electro-optical (EO) turret integrated into the combat system. With the Standard 6 upgrade, various operators are able to simultaneously access the images provided by the MX-20. The French procurement agency Direction g√©n√©rale de l'armement (DGA) has authorised the transfer of the first two upgraded Dassault Atlantique 2 (ATL2) maritime patrol aircraft (MPA) to the French Navy, the French ministry for armed forces announced on 24 October. ;Atlantique 3 :Proposed modernised variant in the 1990s, unbuilt.

A gas generator may create gas by a chemical reaction or from a solid or liquid source, when storing a pressurized gas is undesirable or impractical. The term often refers to a device that uses a rocket propellant to generate large quantities of gas. The gas is typically used to drive a turbine rather than to provide thrust as in a rocket engine. Gas generators of this type are used to power turbopumps in rocket engines, and are used by some auxiliary power units to power electrical generators and hydraulic pumps. Another common use of the term is in the Industrial gases industry, where gas generators are used to produce gaseous chemicals for sale. For example, the chemical oxygen generator, which delivers breathable oxygen at a controlled rate over a prolonged period. During World War II, portable gas generators that converted coke to producer gas were used to power vehicles as a way of alleviating petrol shortages. Other types include the gas generator in an automobile airbag, which is designed to rapidly produce a specific quantity of inert gas. Common applications =As a power source= The V-2 rocket used hydrogen peroxide decomposed by a liquid sodium permanganate catalyst solution as a gas generator. This was used to drive a turbopump to pressurize the main LOX-ethanol propellants. In the Saturn V F-1 and Space Shuttle main engine, some of the main propellant was burned to drive the turbopump (see gas-generator cycle and staged combustion cycle). The gas generator in these designs uses a highly fuel-rich mix to keep flame temperatures relatively low. The Space Shuttle auxiliary power unit and the F-16 emergency power unit (EPU) use hydrazine as a fuel. The gas drives a turbine which drives hydraulic pumps. In the F-16 EPU it also drives an electrical generator. Gas generators have also been used to power torpedoes. For example, the US Navy Mark 16 torpedo was powered by hydrogen peroxide. A concentrated solution of hydrogen peroxide is known as high test peroxide and decomposes to produce oxygen and water (steam). : 2 H2O2 ‚Üí 2 H2O + O2 Hydrazine decomposes to nitrogen and hydrogen. The reaction is strongly exothermic and produces high volume of hot gas from small volume of liquid. #3 N2H4 ‚Üí 4 NH3 \\\\+ N2 #N2H4 ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ 2 H2 #4 NH3 \\\\+ N2H4 ‚Üí 3 N2 \\\\+ 8 H2 Many solid rocket propellant compositions can be used as gas generators. =Inflation and fire suppression= Many automobile airbags use sodium azide for inflation (). A small pyrotechnic charge triggers its decomposition, producing nitrogen gas, which inflates the airbag in around 30 milliseconds. A typical airbag in the US might contain 130 grams of sodium azide. Similar gas generators are used for fire suppression. Sodium azide decomposes exothermically to sodium and nitrogen. : 2 NaN3 -> 2 Na + 3 N2 The resulting sodium is hazardous, so other materials are added, e.g. potassium nitrate and silica, to convert it to a silicate glass. =Oxygen generation= A chemical oxygen generator delivers breathable oxygen at a controlled rate over a prolonged period. Sodium, potassium, and lithium chlorates and perchlorates are used. =Generation of fuel gas= A device that converts coke or other carbonaceous material into producer gas may be used as a source of fuel gas for industrial use. Portable gas generators of this type were used during World War II to power vehicles as a way of alleviating petrol shortages.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 2001. In the episode, Ned Flanders builds a Christian-themed amusement park to commemorate his dead wife, Maude Flanders. The episode marked the return of the character Rachel Jordan (voiced by Shawn Colvin), who had previously appeared in the season eleven episode \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\". Since airing, \\"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\\" has received mixed reviews from critics. Plot During an ice cream social at church, Ned Flanders reunites with Rachel Jordan, a woman he met after hearing her and her Christian rock band sing at church after suffering the loss of his wife Maude. Rachel decides to stay with Ned for the night, but leaves after waking up to find Ned, who she notices has not gotten over Maude's death, cutting her hair to resemble Maude's. Ned asks the Simpson family to help him forget about Maude by throwing away everything in the house that reminds him of her except for a sketchbook. Ned looks through her many sketches until he finds designs for a Christian theme park, called Praiseland. With the encouragement of his sons and the Simpsons, he decides to fulfill Maude's dream by building a Christian theme park in her honor. When Praiseland opens, the townspeople are put off by its excessive wholesomeness and leave, until a mask of Maude's face rises up in the air in front of a memorial statue of her. Believing they are witnessing a miracle, the townspeople gather to watch the mask float around briefly until Principal Skinner collapses near the statue, writhes and experiences a vision of Heaven. The park-goers then immediately decide to experience their own visions of Heaven from the statue; with the Simpsons encouraging Ned to donate the extra money from these proceedings to the local orphanage. Ned explains to his children this is God's will until he notices Homer trying to work the gas grill at a concession stand. He then discovers a gas line near Maude's statue is leaking, causing everyone to inhale the fumes, which explains the visions. He finds out from the utility company that the gas is dangerous and tries to shut the place down, but Homer points out that Praiseland has brought everyone together. The joy is short- lived when Homer spots two orphans lighting candles near the leaking gas, forcing him and Ned to tackle them before an explosion can happen. The townspeople believe Ned and Homer assaulted the children and the former is forced to shut down Praiseland. Rachel, now in a wig to cover the Maude hair, returns to accept a date from Ned. That night, they get rid of Maude's imprint on Ned's bed and make plans for another date. Production Musician Shawn Colvin reappeared as Rachel Jordan in the episode. \\"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\\" was written by Julie Thacker and directed by Chuck Sheetz as part of the twelfth season of The Simpsons (2000‚Äì2001). The idea for Praiseland came from the Christian theme park Heritage USA that was built in Fort Mill, South Carolina in the 1970s. The gas leak that occurs in Praiseland in the episode is based on a real life event that has happened at Disney World. The bible gum product that is sold at Praiseland was real unbeknown to the writers, and, according to executive producer Mike Scully, they were sued by the owners of the company that produced the real product. The episode marked the return of the character Rachel Jordan, who had previously appeared in the season eleven episode \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" (2000). Rachel was guest voiced by American musician Shawn Colvin in both episodes. Colvin has told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearances: \\"It's just very isolated [in Carbondale]. There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town.\\" Release The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 2001. On August 18, 2009, it was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons ‚Äì The Complete Twelfth Season. Staff members Mike Scully, Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Carolyn Omine, Don Payne, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, and Chuck Sheetz participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode, including an alternate ending, were featured in the box set as well. Critics have given \\"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\\" generally mixed reviews. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that \\"Given its theme, 'Praiseland' comes with a large risk of turning sappy. And it does! From its thin plot to its uninspired gags, the show never manages to get any legs under it. This is forgettable Simpsons.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com wrote in her review that episode \\"was part touching, part creepy and part hysterical. Homer was his old self: His heart was in the right place, but he screwed up everything. I felt for Ned, but at the same time grimaced when he touched Maude's imprint on the bed. My only real complaint is the very end. The last few episodes [of the twelfth season] have had typical sitcom wrap-up lines.\\" References External links The Simpsons (season 12) episodes 2001 American television episodes ","title":"I'm Goin' to Praiseland"},{"id":"1783075","text":"John Cochran. James Blundell (27 December 1790 Holborn, London ‚Äì 15 January 1878 St George Hanover Square, London) was an English obstetrician who performed the first successful transfusion of human blood to a patient for treatment of a haemorrhage.Ellis, H. Surgical Anniversaries: James Blundell, pioneer of blood transfusion British Journal of Hospital Medicine, August 2007, Vol 68, No 8. Early years James Blundell was born in London. His father's name was Major Blundell and mother was Sarah Ann Haighton. Major owned a company called Major Blundell and Co. Haberdashers, and Drapers in London. Like his uncle, who had developed several instruments still used today for the delivery of babies, James specialized in the field of obstetrics. Later he graduated from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with his MD in 1813. A year later he began his career in London by lecturing on midwifery and physiology. By 1818, he succeeded his uncle and became the lecturer on both subjects at Guy's Hospital where his classes on obstetrics and the diseases of women were reported to be the largest in London. Blood transfusion work In 1818, Blundell proposed that a blood transfusion would be appropriate to treat severe postpartum hemorrhage. He had seen many of his patients dying in childbirth, and determined to develop a remedy. However, he was also familiar with the work of Leacock in Edinburgh, who said that the transfer of blood from one species would be harmful to another. Therefore, Blundell conducted a series of experiments using animals, and observed that as long as the blood was transfused quickly, a transfusion would be successful with a syringe even after it had been collected in a container. He also discovered the importance of letting all the air out of a syringe prior to the transfusion. Article on transfusions by Dr. Blundell in The Lancet, from 1829. Although there is some conflict between whether his first successful transfusion occurred in 1818 or 1829, it seems more likely that in 1829 he performed the first successful human to human transfusion. Regardless of the date, it is agreed upon that Dr. Blundell extracted four ounces of blood from the arm of the patient's husband using a syringe, and successfully transfused it into the patient. Over the course of five years, he conducted ten documented blood transfusions, five of which were beneficial to the patients, and published these results. During his life he also devised many instruments for the transfusion of blood, many of which are still in use today. He became the author of Researches Physiological and Pathological in 1824 and wrote two papers on abdominal surgery and blood transfusion, both edited by S. Ashwell. Later publications include Principles and Practice of Obstetricy in 1834 and Observations on some of the More Important Diseases of Women in 1837. In using the uterine sound for diagnostic purposes, he was considered more advanced than other obstetricians of the day. Later life He left Guy's in 1834 following a dispute with the hospital treasurer. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1838, and later published Hexametrical Experiments, or, A version of four of Virgil's pastorals... with hints to explain the method of reading, and a slight essay on the laws of metre that year. Dr. Blundell never married, but lived with his grand niece Mary Ann Harriet Noyes. From the 1871 British Census, we know he was living at 80 Piccadilly in London, but he also had a home in Westminster at No. 1 Great George Street. Dr. Blundell retired from practice in 1847. In his final years, it is said that he never rose before noon, saw patients in the afternoon, dined and then saw more patients after 8 or 9 pm. He always carried books with him, and was able to read them in his carriage by the installation of a special light. Death James Blundell died on 15 January 1878 in London, aged 87. His will, dated 11 April 1857 with a codicil of 27 March 1876, was proven on 29 January by his nephew Dr. George Augustus Frederick Wilks. His estate was valued at ¬£350,000 at the time, today equivalent of over ¬£45,000,000. The fortune had been amassed by his large private practice and significant bequests. Much of it was left to his niece Sarah Haighton Noyes (n√©e Wilks) whose husband Henry Crine Noyes had died five years earlier.

Although the poems of the Neoterics may seem to address superficial subjects, they are viewed as subtle and accomplished works of art. Neoterics Influenced by the Greek Hellenistic poets, the Neoterics or poetae novi (writing in the 1st century BC) rejected traditional social and literary norms. Their poetry is characterized by tight construction, a playful use of genre, punning, and complex allusions. The most significant surviving Neoteric works are those of Catullus. His poetry exemplifies the elegant vocabulary, meter, and sound which the Neoterics sought, while balancing it with the equally important allusive element of their style. Latin poets normally classified as neoterics are Catullus and his fellow poets such as Helvius Cinna, Publius Valerius Cato, Marcus Furius Bibaculus, Quintus Cornificius, etc. Some neoteric stylistic features can also be seen in the works of Virgil, who was one generation younger than the poetae novi. They were occasionally the subject of scorn from older, more traditionally minded Romans such as Cicero.

It is designed to provide delivery of audio or video content over an IP network to a PC or other playback device in such a way that the distributor can control how that content is used. WMDRM includes the following components: * Windows Media Rights Manager (WMRM) SDK for packaging content and issuing licenses * Windows Media Format SDK (WMF SDK) for building Windows applications which support DRM and the Windows Media format * Windows Media DRM for Portable Devices (WMDRM-PD) for supporting offline playback on portable devices (Janus) * Windows Media DRM for Network Devices (WMDRM-ND) for streaming protected content to devices attached to a home network (Cardea) Windows Media DRM was replaced in Windows 10 Anniversary Update in favor of Microsoft PlayReady. How it works In May 2007 Microsoft published the network protocol behind its license acquisition mechanism.[MS-DRM: Digital Rights Management License Acquisition Data Structure], Microsoft Development Network Library, rev. 2.0, March 14, 2008. According to the specification, the client software obtains a 7 byte plain-text content key Kcontent from the license server. The server encrypts the key before transferring it to the client with a globally predefined 160-bit ECC key, ECC1. The server also sends a content key ID, unencrypted. The client then uses the Kcontent as an RC4 key to decrypt the licensed media stream. As an anti-spoofing measure, additional fields such as playback rights and a random number are encrypted with three more predefined ECC key pairs either by the client or server software: * client software ECC key pair KC, * client machine ECC key pair KM, * server software ECC key pair KS. An analysis of version 2 of the DRM scheme in Windows Media Audio revealed that it was using a combination of elliptic curve cryptography key exchange, the DES block cipher, a custom block cipher dubbed MultiSwap (for MACs only), the RC4 stream cipher, and the SHA-1 hashing function. Windows Media DRM is designed to be renewable, that is, it is designed on the assumption that it will be cracked and must be constantly updated by Microsoft.Microsoft to Update Windows Media DRM, PC World, Aug 29, 2006 http://www.pcworld.com/article/126955/microsoft_to_update_windows_media_drm.html The result is that while the scheme has been cracked several times, it has usually not remained cracked for long. Version 1 was released in April 1999 and supported basic business rules such as expiration dates. Version 2 was released in January 2003 and is also known as version 7.x and 9, to keep in sync with the equivalent versions of Windows Media Player. Version 3, better known as DRM v10, was released in 2004. Earlier versions of the system have cracks available, meaning content restricted with these versions can have the protections stripped. Version 10 was cracked in early 2005, but a software update was shortly pushed which sealed the relevant hole. Generally, these sorts of cracks have all worked in the same way to a certain extent. Rather than break the encryption itself, which is infeasible, they hook or interfere with the \\"black box\\" component as it runs to dump out the content keys or the unencrypted content from memory. Interoperability Content delivered with WMDRM encryption is not universally accessible. Microsoft Windows supports playback of content protected with WMDRM encryption, and the format has become popular with consumer electronics manufacturers, many of whom have licensed the WMDRM decode component for devices like television sets, set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. The open network protocol for digital rights management, [MS- DRM] from the MCPP collection, stipulates that software developers have a right to implement the protocol outside the Microsoft's development tools and environment. Removal Tools have been created to strip files of Windows Media DRM, enabling them to be played on non-Janus platforms. These tools typically were developed with one specific Individualized Blackbox Component (IBX) version in mind and rarely work on a version they were not explicitly designed for. Microsoft in addition to upgrading the IBX whenever it was cracked, also pursued legal action against those who developed and hosted these tools, driving the development and distribution even further underground and fragmenting it. These tools can be split into three categories: decrypter, key-finder, and all-in-one (finds the keys and then decrypts). Microsoft has been more successful in squashing the development and distribution of the tools capable of key finding than those that decrypt encoding, as is apparent by the continual existence of the SourceForge project FreeMe2.http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeme2/ =FairUse4WM= It was claimed that one particular tool, FairUse4WM (released on August 19, 2006) written by Viodentia, had the ability to strip DRM from files protected with WMDRM. This is an all-in-one tool. Microsoft responded in several ways. First, on August 28, 2006 Microsoft released a new version of the IBX to prevent this particular tool from working. Microsoft also informed partners that they were working to further resolve this issue, given that allegedly the fix was also circumvented within days. Microsoft also issued takedown notices to Web site owners distributing FairUse4WM. Finally, on September 22, 2006, Microsoft filed a federal lawsuit against John Does 1‚Äì10 a/k/a \\"viodentia\\", hoping to identify the person or persons responsible. However, the operator of the highest-ranked mirror of the utility, James Holden, denies having received any such notices or threats. Unable to find the identity of Viodentia, in April 2007 Microsoft dropped the civil suits they had filed. By October 16, 2006, distributors using the Windows Media DRM protection, such as Sky Anytime, were using a patched codec. On September 6, 2007, Microsoft updated IBX to version 11.0.6000.7000, in an attempt to thwart circumvention efforts by variants of the original program. And, as of November 28, 2007, DRM Removal under Windows XP on new installs or updated computers (i.e. those that already contain IBX version 11.0.6000.7000), is not possible without rolling back to Windows Media Player 10. In 2008 another patched version of FairUse4WM was released, allowing it to work with Windows Vista, and IBX versions lower than 11.0.6000.6324. In a ploy to confuse the abusers or software tools, Microsoft revisited the controversial 11.0.6000.6324 version number, releasing a new IBX version, but giving the file a deceptive older version number. =DRMDBG= DRMDBG is a key-finder, it extracts the keys by hooking an instance of Windows Media Player that it launches. There are several version available each targeting a specific version. The version released on March 3, 2009 supports IBX versions 11.0.6000.6324 and 11.0.6001.8000. =Mirakagi= Mirakagi was one of the first key-finders; it is no longer in development.

It is located in Winona County in the southeastern blufflands area of the state. The park features scenic overlooks and trout fishing in the spring-fed Whitewater River and Trout Run Creek. It has about 300,000 visitors annually, and is located north of St. Charles on Minnesota State Highway 74, which runs through the park. Historic structures The park's 1930s facilities are listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Whitewater State Park CCC/WPA/Rustic Style Historic Resources. The historic district includes 29 contributing properties. The district was listed for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture, entertainment/recreation, landscape architecture, and politics/government. It was nominated for its examples of New Deal federal work relief, diverse National Park Service rustic design, and landscape architecture on a challenging site. Landforms The park's bedrock is lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks, with limestone and dolomite especially prevalent near the surface. It is highly dissected, and the Whitewater River has cut deep valleys into the bedrock. It is an area of karst topography. Lifeforms The park is located where the Rochester Plateau Subsection and the Blufflands Subsection meet, both of which are part of the Paleozoic Plateau section of the Eastern Broadleaf Forest Province.Ecological Classification System, Paleozoic Plateau Section, Rochester Plateau Subsection, and The Blufflands Subsection; all published by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. 2007 flood The August 18 and 19, 2007 Midwest flooding caused extensive damage to the park. The park is in the Driftless Area, where soils are thin and less able to retain water; they lie atop porous rock into and through which surface waters can rapidly drain into the water table. The steep hills and bluffs and deep coulees give steep gradients to the drainage and makes streams highly erosive. As the rains far exceeded the absorption rate of the soils, flash floods rapidly overflowed the river and spread across the valley floors. About 500 campers were staying in the park at the time. Three bridges were destroyed, and campgrounds, bathhouses, a group dining hall, and water and sewer systems suffered extensive damage. Damage was in excess of four million dollars, and the park was closed to the public on August 20, 2007, and remained closed the balance of the year.

Iowa 17's southern end is near Granger in Dallas County at a freeway interchange with Iowa Highway 141, and its northern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Highway 18 at the Kossuth-Hancock county line near Wesley. Route description Iowa 17 near Wesley Iowa Highway 17 begins at a trumpet interchange with Iowa Highway 141 near Granger. It goes north to Madrid, where it intersects Iowa Highway 210. It continues north through Luther and then intersects U.S. Highway 30 east of Boone. It proceeds north from U.S. 30 and has a one-mile (1.6 km) overlap with Iowa Highway 175 in Stanhope. It goes north, then turns northwest to go towards Webster City, and intersects U.S. Highway 20 there. They overlap going west from Webster City, then Iowa 17 turns north to go through Eagle Grove. It continues north to Goldfield, where it intersects Iowa Highway 3. Iowa 17 and Iowa 3 overlap to the border between Wright and Humboldt Counties, then Iowa 17 turns north. It passes through Renwick and Corwith, then ends on the border separating Hancock and Kossuth Counties east of Wesley. History Although Iowa 17 has only been designated since 1969, most of the route has been a part of the primary highway system since the system's inception in 1919. The route was designated Primary Road No. 60 and connected Des Moines and Goldfield via Webster City. By 1930, the only paved section of what was by then called Iowa 60 was the southernmost from Des Moines to south of Madrid. In two years, paving extended to US 30 east of Boone. 1932 saw many changes to Iowa 60. The route was extended to the north where it ended at US 18 in Wesley, and extended southward through Des Moines and Knoxville to the Missouri state line, effectively doubling its length. The section of Iowa 60 south of Des Moines is now known as Iowa 5\\\\. Little changed in the Iowa 60 north of Des Moines over the next twenty years. The only paving that was completed was in Wright County. By 1957, that paving extended to the northern end at US 18. On January 1, 1969, the Iowa State Highway Commission renumbered several state highways in the state. They sought to create continuous numbers across state lines and remove unnecessary duplicate route numbers where they could. Since it crossed the state line into Missouri, the southern half of the route was renumbered Iowa 5 to match Missouri Route 5. Throughout Des Moines, Iowa 60 overlapped many other routes, so the designation was removed between the I-35/now-Iowa 5 interchange to the intersection with Iowa 141 in Granger. The section of Iowa 60 north of Granger became Iowa 17. Since becoming Iowa 17, the route has changed little. By 1976, paving was completed and the southern end of the route was converted into an interchange with Iowa 141. By the end of the 1970s, the highway was rerouted around Webster City when US 20 was realigned onto a new freeway.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 13, 2001. In the episode, after spraining his knee during a basketball game, Homer begins taking care of the neighborhood kids to cure his boredom, prompting jealousy from Bart and Lisa, who feel that Homer is giving the kids the attention they never had. The episode is written by current show runner, Al Jean, and directed by Michael Polcino. The title is a parody of the play/movie Children of a Lesser God. Plot The family goes to the local YMCA to attend one-time-only free classes. Homer participates in a basketball class, but suffers a torn ACL after a dunk attempt ends with the backboard crashing down on his leg. After Homer gets surgery, he is told by Dr. Hibbert that he cannot go to work and must stay home, where he finds himself extremely bored. One evening, Ned asks Homer to watch Rod and Todd while he attends a Chris Rock concert (that he believes is a Christian rock concert). Rod and Todd enjoy having Homer take care of them, which gives Homer the idea to establish his own day care center. Homer turns his house into the \\"Uncle Homer's Day Care Center\\". With Homer giving all his attention to other kids, Bart and Lisa feel neglected. The daycare center is wildly successful, and Homer earns a nomination for the \\"Good Guy Awards\\". But during a video tribute at the awards ceremony, Bart and Lisa splice in home movie footage of Homer at his worst (passed out drunk next to the tree on Christmas day, losing Maggie to Moe in a poker game, and chasing Bart with a medieval flail while yelling, \\"I'll mace you good!\\"). The audience becomes outraged and Homer angrily strangles Bart on stage. Everyone in the audience becomes horrified by Homer's behavior, and they decide to prevent him from watching their kids. Homer escapes from the ceremony with all the kids in a van, until he crashes into a tree, and is caught by the police. After three mistrials, Homer apologizes to Bart and Lisa for neglecting them, and promises to care for his own children instead of the neighborhood kids. The episode ends with the family eating from the craft services table because the union workers never came to retrieve it. Production alt=Al Jean wrote the episode. \\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\" was written by Al Jean and directed by Michael Polcino. Jean initially had multiple different storylines including Homer getting hurt, before he eventually pitched them all into this episode. During production, the staff members looks for an actual NBA player to appear with a shotgun during the first act, but no player accepted the role. The line when Milhouse says he knows Bart's dad better than Bart knows him is a reference to based on a real- life experience of producer Mike Reiss. During production the animators need Ralph to get off screen for a two shot so they decided that Ralph followed a butterfly. This episode was advertised as featuring Ron Howard, in what would have been his third appearance on The Simpsons (his first two appearances can be found in Season Ten's \\"When You Dish Upon a Star\\", and Season Eleven's \\"Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder\\"). Originally, the third act involved Homer getting all the kids in Howard's latest film, an Gladiator‚Äìlike picture, hence the original title of the episode being \\"The Kids Stay In The Picture\\" (a play on the title of producer Robert Evans' The Kid Stays in the Picture). However, Howard did not appear in this episode (in fact, no guest voices were used at all in this episode). The third act was about Homer winning the Good Guy Award, for caring for the neighbourhood kids. However, this was all until his own children show him as an unfit father. When Homer puts his daycare permit in the picture frame Bart and Lisa gave him was based on a real-life experience of former writer Dana Gould in which he gave his parents a newspaper article about him winning a Boston comedy competition and later found out that it was replaced by Larry Bird dunking butterfingers. The third act did not initially include a police car chase and it was placed in after the table read. The scratches in Homer's day-care video were added to the animation in post-production. Cultural references Lugash the weight trainer is a parody of B√©la K√°rolyi. The title is a spoof of the play Children of a Lesser God and the 1986 film based upon it. The episode features the original basket for basketball. Professor Frink's use of \\"Flubber\\" alludes to the 1997 film of the same name, and also references a scene from the film in which the main character (played by Robin Williams) jumps around a basketball court with the aid of Flubber-coated shoes. A reference of George Jetson was used in this episode while Homer hallucinates about taking a basketball shot in space. He even says \\"Jetson!\\" the way Mr. Spacely does. Lugash is a parody of B√©la K√°rolyi. During Homer's psychotic break, he references his old catchphrase \\"Let's go out for frosty chocolate milkshakes\\". The ‚Äúbus disaster‚Äù Krusty references as being in the news was a real life accident that claimed the lives of four middle school students from the Boston area just two weeks prior to the airing of this episode. Internet reception A short segment of the episode features Bill Cosby asking a child on his show Kids Say the Darndest Things about games he likes to play, to which the child promptly replies \\"Pok√©mon!\\" Cosby begins incoherently rambling about what Pok√©mon is whilst flapping his ears. This is a parodied mannerism of Cosby's that is often used on the show. Another similar gag was used in the episode \\"Helter Shelter\\". In this episode Pok√©mon is incorrectly pronounced \\"Pok-ee-mon\\". This is the second time Cosby has been parodied on The Simpsons. The first was \\"'Round Springfield\\". This sequence involving Bill Cosby's exaggerated mannerisms from this and other episodes on The Simpsons (as well as the Family Guy episode \\"Brian Does Hollywood\\") became an internet meme when many parodies on these particular segments became internet memes in their own right, especially on YouTube and YTMND. A scene in the episode where Homer's festering scab wound heals over Ralph's hand in a close up was negatively received by fans. During the getaway scene, Ralph asks Homer \\"where are you taking us?\\", Homer replies \\"for frosty chocolate milkshakes!\\" This is a reference to one of Homer's old taglines from the shorts and Season 1. Reception Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave this episode a mixed review, saying \\"When Bart and Lisa team up to pursue a goal, the result usually succeeds. And that‚Äôs true for ‚ÄúClod‚Äù ‚Äì at least to a moderate degree. Like most Season 12 episodes, the program doesn't become truly delightful, but it does more right than wrong, so it ends up as a decent success.\\"http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasontwelve.shtml References External links *\\"Children of a Lesser Clod\\" at The Simpsons.com The Simpsons (season 12) episodes 2001 American television episodes Internet memes Basketball animation Cultural depictions of Bill Cosby ","title":"Children of a Lesser Clod"},{"id":"1783146","text":"Our Lady of Victories Basilica Our Lady of Victories Basilica is a Catholic church located in the Melbourne suburb of Camberwell.

According to the 2005 census the population of the city was 40,630 inhabitants, while the municipality, which has an area of 708.53 km¬≤ (273.56 sq mi), reported 50,663 inhabitants. Except for its coastline on the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortes), the municipality is entirely surrounded by the much larger municipality of Guaymas. In Spanish, the word empalme means \\"junction\\". At first, the community site was called Kil√≥metro Nueve because it was nine kilometers out of the port city of Guaymas. Then for a while it was called El Empalme meaning the junction. The El was soon dropped. Unlike other towns or cities in Mexico, Empalme was built completely by foreigners, specifically the Utah Construction Company under contract to the Southern Pacific Railroad Company. Very few native materials were used in the construction. The founders owned a major railroad, affording easy transportation of materials and personnel. The purpose of the settlement was to provide repair facilities for SP operations in Mexico, with a large shop and roundhouse. They still exist today, although unused; repair and maintenance now being done in Guadalajara, Jalisco. Hundreds of the homes built originally still exist in Empalme, their design and materials unchanged. One native feature that the developers used was the planting of hundreds of Ficus microcarpa known locally as the Yucateco brought from southern Mexico. It grows to heights exceeding 100 feet. Their common name implies that they are native to the state of Yucat√°n. These trees were well suited for the hot, humid climate of Empalme. They are still probably the most easily recognized feature of the town. In many places they cover entire streets for several blocks so that streets appear to be passing through a tunnel. Climate Economy The economy of Empalme is based on agriculture, cattle ranching, fishing and small industries. The salty soil and lack of water makes agriculture difficult. Main crops are wheat, melon, and squash. Cattle raising is modest with the 2000 census reporting more than 9,000 head. With its 30 kilometer coastline there is fishing with hauls of shrimp, shark, crab, and octopus, among others. Pollution and the heating of the ocean water due to the thermal electric plant of Batuecas have reduced the local catches in recent years. There is an industrial area nearby with small transformation industries. The main employer in the town continues to be the railroad repair facilities, which employed over 3,000 workers in 2000. The Conurbation Zoning Plan for Guaymas & Empalme has included a Maritime Port & Industrial zone on the county coastline that will help to grow import & export cargos from local producers in Sonora, as well as a deep sea port for the Southwestern United States for energy products. In the tourist sector there is potential in the long coastline of sandy beaches, which has not yet been developed.

From an early 20th century manuscript found in Chaiya District, Surat Thani Province, Thailandfrom Teaching Dhamma by pictures: Explanation of a Siamese Traditional Buddhist Manuscript In Buddhism, ''''' is a Pali word (Sanskrit: karmasthana) which literally means the place of work. Its original meaning was someone's occupation (farming, trading, cattle-tending, etc.). It has several distinct but related usages, all having to do with Buddhist meditation. Etymology Its most basic meaning is as a word for meditation. In Burma senior meditation practitioners are known as \\"kammatthanacariyas\\" (meditation masters). Buddhaghosa uses \\"kammatthana\\" to refer to each of his forty meditation objects listed in the third chapter of the Visuddhimagga, which are partially derived from the PƒÅli Canon.Buddhaghosa & Nanamoli (1999), pp. 90‚Äì91 (II, 27‚Äì28, \\"Development in Brief\\"), 110ff. (starting with III, 104, \\"enumeration\\"). It can also be found sprinkled earlier in this text as on p. 18 (I, 39, v. 2) and p. 39 (I, 107). Throughout Nanamoli translates this term as \\"meditation subject.\\" In the Pali literature, prior to the post-canonical Pali commentaries, the term ' comes up in only a handful of discourses and then in the context of \\"work\\" or \\"trade.\\" The Thai Forest Tradition names itself Kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna Forest tradition.  Buddhaghosa's forty meditation subjects  Of the forty objects meditated upon as kammatthana, the first ten are 'things that one can behold directly', 'kasina', or 'a whole': : (1) earth, (2) water, (3) fire, (4) air, wind, (5) blue, (6) yellow, (7) red, (8) white, (9) enclosed space, (10) bright light. The next ten are objects of repulsion (asubha): : (1) swollen corpse, (2) discolored, bluish, corpse, (3) festering corpse, (4) fissured corpse, (5) gnawed corpse, (6,7) dismembered, or hacked and scattered, corpse, (8) bleeding corpse, (9) worm-eaten corpse, (10) skeleton. Ten are recollections (anussati): : First three recollections are of the virtues of the Three Jewels: ::(1) Buddha ::(2) Dharma ::(3) Sangha : Next three are recollections of the virtues of: ::(4) morality (≈öƒ´la) ::(5) liberality (cƒÅga) ::(6) the wholesome attributes of Devas : Recollections of: ::(7) the body (kƒÅya) ::(8) death (see Upajjhatthana Sutta) ::(9) the breath (prƒÅna) or breathing (ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅna) ::(10) peace (see Nibbana). Four are stations of Brahma (Brahma-vihara): :(1) unconditional kindness and goodwill (mettƒÅ) :(2) compassion (karuna) :(3) sympathetic joy over another's success (mudita) :(4) evenmindedness, equanimity (upekkha) Four are formless states (four ar≈´pajhƒÅnas): :(1) infinite space :(2) infinite consciousness :(3) infinite nothingness :(4) neither perception nor non-perception. One is of perception of disgust of food (aharepatikulasanna). The last is analysis of the four elements (catudhatuvavatthana): earth (pathavi), water (apo), fire (tejo), air (vayo). Each kammatthana can be suggested, especially by a spiritual friend ('), to a certain individual student at some specific point, by assessing what would be best for that student's temperament and the present state of his or her mind.See, e.g., Buddhaghosa & Nanamoli (1999), p. 90, which states: \\"He should approach the good friend, the giver of a meditation subject, and he should apprehend from among the forty meditation subjects one that suits his own temperament.\\"  Meditation subjects and jhanas  According to Gunaratana, following Buddhaghosa, due to the simplicity of subject matter, all four jhanas can be induced through ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasati (mindfulness of breathing) and the ten kasinas.Gunaratana (1988). According to Gunaratana, the following meditation subjects only lead to \\"access concentration\\" (upacara samadhi), due to their complexity: the recollection of the Buddha, dharma, sangha, morality, liberality, wholesome attributes of Devas, death, and peace; the perception of disgust of food; and the analysis of the four elements. Absorption in the first jhana can be realized by mindfulness on the ten kinds of foulness and mindfulness of the body. However, these meditations cannot go beyond the first jhana due to their involving applied thought (vitaka), which is absent from the higher jhanas. Absorption in the first three jhanas can be realized by contemplating the first three brahma-viharas. However, these meditations cannot aid in attaining the fourth jhana due to the pleasant feelings associated with them. Conversely, once the fourth jhana is induced, the fourth brahma-vihara (equanimity) arises.  Meditation subjects and temperaments  All of the aforementioned meditation subjects can suppress the Five Hindrances, thus allowing one to fruitfully pursue wisdom. In addition, anyone can productively apply specific meditation subjects as antidotes, such as meditating on foulness to counteract lust or on the breath to abandon discursive thought. The Pali commentaries further provide guidelines for suggesting meditation subjects based on one's general temperament: * Greedy: the ten foulness meditations; or, body contemplation. * Hating: the four brahma-viharas; or, the four color kasinas. * Deluded: mindfulness of breath. * Faithful: the first six recollections. * Intelligent: recollection of marana or Nibbana; the perception of disgust of food; or, the analysis of the four elements. * Speculative: mindfulness of breath. The six non-color kasinas and the four formless states are suitable for all temperaments.

Founded in 1852, it is affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA). The student population is approximately 1,307 undergraduate and graduate students. History Westminster formed as a result of a meeting on Jan. 21, 1852, between the Ohio and Shenango Presbyteries. In 2009, The Washington Monthly' ranked Westminster College \\"third in social mobility\\" among 253 liberal arts colleges. In 2010, Forbes ranked Westminster first in the nation as the \\"Best College for Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.\\" In 2008 36% Westminster's graduating class received their degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (known colloquially as STEM)--and unusually, more of those STEM graduates were women than men. Campus Westminster is located in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, a town of 2,466 residents located north of Pittsburgh and south of Erie and Cleveland on a campus. Athletics The Westminster Titans compete in NCAA Division III athletics. Before moving to the NCAA, Westminster competed in the NAIA for many years. For a brief period, Westminster was a member of the NCAA Division II Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (GLIAC). The Titans currently are a member of the Presidents' Athletic Conference. The first official football game by the Westminster Titans was in December 1891. They lost to Geneva 42‚Äì0. The next year was the first official season; they played 4 games that year and went 3‚Äì1. Over the next 100 plus years, the Titans have had a record of 577‚Äì406‚Äì54. They are one of only 10 schools to record over 575 wins in school history. They have won the national championship 6 times with 11 undefeated seasons. Four former Titans football players have been enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame: Harold Davis, Joe Fusco, Larry Pugh, and Harold Burry. Hall of Fame head coach Tuss McLaughry was not an alumnus but did coach the Titans for four years.2009 Football Media Guide, Westminster College, p. 35, retrieved June 16, 2010. The current head football coach of the Titans is Scott Benzel, who became head coach in 2014.

The crash required more than four years of preparation by NASA Ames Research Center, Langley Research Center, Dryden Flight Research Center, the FAA, and General Electric. After numerous test runs, the plane was crashed on December 1, 1984. The test went generally according to plan, and produced a spectacular fireball that required more than an hour to extinguish. The FAA concluded that about one-quarter of the passengers would have survived, that the antimisting kerosene test fuel did not sufficiently reduce the risk of fire, and that several changes to equipment in the passenger compartment of aircraft were needed. NASA concluded that a head-up display and microwave landing system would have helped the pilot more safely fly the aircraft. Background and experiment setup Practice approach NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted a joint program for the acquisition, demonstration, and validation of technology for the improvement of transport aircraft occupant crash survivability using a large, four-engine, remotely piloted transport airplane in a controlled impact demonstration (CID). The CID program was conducted at the Dryden Flight Research Facility of NASA Ames Research Center (Ames-Dryden), at Edwards, California, using a remotely controlled Boeing 720 transport, and was completed in late 1984. The objectives of the CID program were to demonstrate a reduction of postcrash fire through the use of antimisting fuel, acquire transport crash structural data, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of existing improved seat-restraint and cabin structural systems.Horton and Kempel 1988, p. 1. The Boeing 720 (tail number N833NA) was purchased new by the FAA in 1960 as a training aircraft.FAA/CT-87/10 1987, p. 5. After more than 20,000 hours and 54,000 takeoff and landing cycles, it had come to the end of its useful life. The aircraft was turned over to NASA-Ames/Dryden Flight Research Center for the CID program in 1981. Slapdown Before impact After impact 1 After impact 2 After impact 3 The additive, ICI's FM-9, a high molecular-weight long chain polymer, when blended with Jet-A fuel, forms antimisting kerosene (AMK). AMK had demonstrated the capability to inhibit ignition and flame propagation of the released fuel in simulated impact tests. AMK cannot be introduced directly into a gas turbine engine due to several possible problems such as clogging of filters. The AMK must be restored to almost Jet-A before being introduced into the engine for burning. This restoration is called degradation and was accomplished on the Boeing 720 using a device called a degrader. Each of the four Pratt & Whitney JT3C-7 engines had a degrader built and installed by General Electric (GE) to break down and return the AMK to near Jet-A quality. In addition to the AMK research, NASA Langley Research Center was involved in a structural load measurement experiment, which included using instrumented crash dummies in the seats of the passenger compartment and cockpit. Before the final flight in 1984, more than four years of effort was expended in attempting to establish final impact conditions which would be considered to be survivable by the FAA. Over a series of 14 flights, General Electric installed and tested four degraders (one on each engine); the FAA refined AMK, blending, testing, and fueling a full size aircraft. During the flights the aircraft made approximately 69 approaches, to about above the prepared crash site, under remote control. These flights were used to introduce AMK one step at a time into some of the fuel tanks and engines while monitoring the performance of the engines. During those same flights, NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center also developed the remote piloting techniques necessary for the Boeing 720 to fly as a drone aircraft. An initial attempt at the full- scale test was scrubbed in late 1983 due to problems with the uplink connection to the 720; if the uplink failed the ground-based pilot would no longer have control of the aircraft. Test execution On the morning of December 1, 1984, the test aircraft took off from Edwards Air Force Base, California, made a left-hand departure and climbed to an altitude of . The aircraft was remotely flown by NASA research pilot Fitzhugh Fulton from the NASA Dryden Remotely Controlled Vehicle Facility. All fuel tanks were filled with a total of of AMK and all engines ran from start-up to impact (flight time was 9 minutes) on the modified Jet-A. It then began a descent-to-landing along the roughly 3.8-degree glideslope to a specially prepared runway on the east side of Rogers Dry Lake, with the landing gear remaining retracted. Passing the decision height of above ground level (AGL), the aircraft turned slightly to the right of the desired path. The aircraft entered into a situation known as a Dutch roll. Slightly above that decision point at which the pilot was to execute a \\"go-around\\", there appeared to be enough altitude to maneuver back to the center-line of the runway. The aircraft was below the glideslope and below the desired airspeed. Data acquisition systems had been activated, and the aircraft was committed to impact. The aircraft contacted the ground, left wing low, at full throttle, with the aircraft nose pointing to the left of the center-line. It had been planned that the aircraft would land wings-level, with the throttles set to idle, and exactly on the center- line during the CID, thus allowing the fuselage to remain intact as the wings were sliced open by eight posts cemented into the runway (called \\"Rhinos\\" due to the shape of the \\"horns\\" welded onto the posts). The Boeing 720 landed askew. One of the Rhinos sliced through the number 3 engine, behind the burner can, leaving the engine on the wing pylon, which does not typically happen in an impact of this type. The same rhino then sliced through the fuselage, causing a cabin fire when burning fuel was able to enter the fuselage. The cutting of the number 3 engine and the full-throttle situation was significant, as this was outside the test envelope. The number 3 engine continued to operate for approximately 1/3 of a rotation,FAA/CT-87/10 1987, p. 17. degrading the fuel and igniting it after impact, providing a significant heat source. The fire and smoke took over an hour to extinguish. The CID impact was spectacular with a large fireball created by the number 3 engine on the right side, enveloping and burning the aircraft. From the standpoint of AMK the test was a major set-back. For NASA Langley, the data collected on crashworthiness was deemed successful and just as important. Findings The actual impact demonstrated that the antimisting additive tested was not sufficient to prevent a post-crash fire in all circumstances, though the reduced intensity of the initial fire was attributed to the effect of AMK.FAA/CT-87/10 1987, pp. 20‚Äì22. FAA investigators estimated that 23‚Äì25% of the aircraft's full complement of 113 people could have survived the crash. Time from slide-out to complete smoke obscuration for the forward cabin was five seconds; for the aft cabin, it was 20 seconds. Total time to evacuate was 15 and 33 seconds respectively, accounting for the time necessary to reach and open the doors and operate the slide. Investigators labeled their estimate of the ability to escape through dense smoke as \\"highly speculative\\".FAA/CT-87/10 1987, pp. 39‚Äì40. As a result of analysis of the crash, the FAA instituted new flammability standards for seat cushions which required the use of fire- blocking layers, resulting in seats which performed better than those in the test.FAA/CT-87/10 1987, p. 33. It also implemented a standard requiring floor proximity lighting to be mechanically fastened, due to the apparent detachment of two types of adhesive-fastened emergency lights during the impact.FAA/CT-87/10 1987, p. 38. Federal aviation regulations for flight data recorder sampling rates for pitch, roll and acceleration were found to be insufficient.FAA/CT-87/10 1987, p. 39. NASA concluded that the impact piloting task was of an unusually high workload, which might have been reduced through the use of a heads-up display, the automation of more tasks, and a higher- resolution monitor. It also recommended the use of a microwave landing system to improve tracking accuracy over the standard instrument landing system. In practice, the Global Positioning System-based Wide Area Augmentation System came to fulfill this role.Horton and Kempel 1988, pp. 15‚Äì19.

It depicts the Virgin Mary breastfeeding the Christ child, a devotional subject known as the Madonna lactans. The figures are set in a dark interior with two arched openings, as in Leonardo's earlier Madonna of the Carnation, and a mountainous landscape in aerial perspective can be seen beyond. In his left hand Christ holds a goldfinch, which is symbolic of his future Passion. Scholarly opinion is divided on the work's attribution, with some believing it to be the work of a pupil of Leonardo such as Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio or Marco d'Oggiono; the Hermitage Museum, however, considers the painting to be an autograph work by Leonardo. The painting takes its name from the House of Litta, a Milanese noble family in whose collection it was for much of the nineteenth century. History The Madonna Litta might be one of the paintings of the Madonna and Child recorded in Leonardo's studio before or during his first Milanese period (1481‚Äì3 to 1499). On a drawing in the Uffizi Leonardo noted that he had begun ‚Äútwo Virgin Maries‚Äù in late 1478 and an inventory of his studio written in 1482 (part of the Codex Atlanticus) again mentions two paintings of ‚ÄúOur Lady‚Äù. The second of these is, according to different interpretations, either noted as being ‚Äúalmost finished, in profile‚Äù or ‚Äúfinished, almost in profile‚Äù. The Virgin's head in the Madonna Litta could be described either way, and it has therefore been argued that the painting was begun in Leonardo's first Florentine period and left unfinished until it was later worked up by a pupil in Milan. Scientific analysis of the painting has, however, suggested that it was produced by only one artist. recto.alt= Several drawings have been identified as preparatory to the Madonna Litta. One, which is universally attributed to Leonardo, is a metalpoint drawing of a young woman‚Äôs face in near profile, part of the Codex Vallardi in the Louvre (left). There is evidence that this sheet was used as an exemplum for teaching pupils in Leonardo‚Äôs workshop; on the reverse another artist has traced the outline of the face in pen and ink, a technique Leonardo himself used when developing compositions. Further evidence of pupils copying the drawing comes in the form of a direct copy, by a rather uncertain draughtsman, on a sheet which was turned over and reused for a different drawing by another sixteenth-century artist; this is now in the St√§del in Frankfurt. (cat. no. 60) Two other drawings, in metalpoint with white lead highlights on blue prepared paper, are attributed to a follower of Leonardo, usually considered to be Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio. One, a study for the Christ child's head, is in the Fondation Custodia in Paris; the other, in the Kupferstichkabinett in Berlin, is a drapery study for the Virgin's garments. These have been attributed to Boltraffio on the basis of the Berlin drawing's similarity to other drapery studies by the artist. It has been argued that the Paris and Berlin drawings are preparatory studies for the Madonna Litta rather than copies after it, as the drapery study shows more of the Virgin's right arm than the finished work, in which this is obscured by Christ‚Äôs head. This suggests that the composition was partly pieced together from these studies. A further related drawing in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, attributed to Boltraffio, is of the Virgin's face in strict profile and does not resemble the finished painting in the Hermitage. It has been argued that this study might represent an earlier idea by a pupil for the composition of the Madonna Litta, which the master Leonardo then 'corrected' with the drawing in the Louvre. The painting was repainted by an artist other than Leonardo in Milan around 1495. =Provenance= It has been speculated that Leonardo might have taken the Madonna Litta with him to Venice in March 1500, as the diarist Marcantonio Michiel apparently recorded its presence in the Ca' Contarini in that city in 1543: The earliest print of the composition is Venetian, by an artist in the circle of Zoan Andrea, and at least one painted copy by the Venetian school is known, in the Museo di Castelvecchio in Verona. In 1784, the earliest secure date in its provenance, the painting was bought by Prince Alberico XII di Belgioioso from one Giuseppe Ro. After Belgioioso's death in 1813 it passed into the collection of the Litta family, from whom it takes its current name. In 1865 the Russian Tsar Alexander II acquired the panel from Count Antonio Litta,, n. 5 quondam minister to Saint Petersburg, for the Hermitage Museum, where it has been exhibited to this day. Upon acquiring the painting the Hermitage had it transferred from wood to canvas, when it was again repainted. Attribution That the painting was regarded in Leonardo's lifetime as his work is suggested by the large number of copies made of it. A popular candidate for authorship is Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio. David Alan Brown argues that Marco d'Oggiono was responsible for the Madonna Litta as its composition is reflected in his later works, whereas it is not in those of Boltraffio. In the major exhibition on Leonardo's first Milanese period held at the National Gallery in London in 2011‚Äì12 the painting was attributed to Leonardo, but art historian Martin Kemp has remarked that this was \\"presumably a condition of the loan\\". Kemp said in 2017 that he regarded the painting as a Boltraffio. References Footnotes Citations =Sources= : : (cat. no.

It is taken by mouth. Use is not recommended in those under the age of ten. Effects generally begin within 20 minutes and last up to eight hours. Side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, headache, upset stomach, skin rash, hallucinations, and allergic reactions. Excessive doses may cause seizures, irregular heartbeat, and death. Chewing or sucking on the capsule can lead to laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and circulatory collapse. It is unclear if use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. It works by numbing stretch receptors in the lungs and suppressing the cough reflex in the brain. Benzonatate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1958. It is available as a generic medication. It is not available in many countries. In 2017, it was the 148th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. Medical uses 100mg generic benzonatate capsules = Cough = Benzonatate is a prescription non-opioid alternative for the symptomatic relief of cough. It has been shown to improve cough associated with a variety of respiratory conditions including asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, tuberculosis, pneumothorax, opiate-resistant cough in lung cancer, and emphysema. Benzonatate also reduces the consistency and volume of sputum production associated with cough in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). Compared to codeine, benzonatate has been shown to be more effective in reducing the frequency of induced cough in experiments. Benzonatate does not treat the underlying cause of the cough. = Hiccups = Benzonatate has been shown to have use in the suppression of hiccups. = Intubation = Benzonatate acts as a local anesthetic and the liquid inside the capsule can be applied in the mouth to numb the oropharynx for awake intubation. However, there can be life-threatening adverse effects when the medication is absorbed by the oral mucosa, including choking, hypersensitivity reactions, and circulatory collapse.  Contraindications  Hypersensitivity to benzonatate or any related compounds is a contraindication to its administration. Side effects Benzonatate is generally well-tolerated if the liquid-capsule is swallowed intact. Potential adverse effects to benzonatate include: * Constipation, dizziness, fatigue, stuffy nose, nausea, headache are frequently reported. * Sedation, a feeling of numbness in the chest, sensation of burning in the eyes, a vague \\"chilly\\" sensation, itchiness, and rashes are also possible. * Ingestion of a small handful of capsules has caused seizures, cardiac arrhythmia, and death in adults. = Hypersensitivity reactions = Benzonatate is structurally related to anesthetic medications of the para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) class which includes procaine and tetracaine. Procaine and tetracaine, previously used heavily in the fields of dentistry and anesthesiology, have fallen out of favor due to allergies associated with their metabolites. Similarly, severe hypersensitivity reactions to benzonatate have been reported and include symptoms of laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and cardiovascular collapse. These reactions are possibly associated with chewing, sucking, or crushing the capsule in the mouth. = Improper use = Benzonatate should be swallowed whole. Crushing or sucking on the liquid-filled capsule, or \\"softgel,\\" will cause release of benzonatate from the capsule and can produce a temporary local anesthesia of the oral mucosa. Rapid development of numbness of the tongue and choking can occur. In severe cases, excessive absorption can lead to laryngospasm, bronchospasm, seizures, and circulatory collapse. This may be due to a hypersensitivity reaction to benzonatate or a systemic local anesthetic toxicity, both of which have similar symptoms. There is a potential for these adverse effects to occur at a therapeutic dose, that is, a single capsule, if chewed or sucked on in the mouth. = Psychiatric effects = Isolated cases of bizarre behavior, mental confusion, and visual hallucinations have been reported during concurrent use with other prescribed medications. Central nervous system effects associated with other para- aminobenozic acid (PABA) derivative local anesthetics, for example procaine or tetracaine, could occur with benzonatate and should be considered. = Children = Safety and efficacy in children below the age of 10 have not been established. Accidental ingestion resulting in death has been reported in children below the age of 10. Benzonatate may be attractive to children due to its appearance, a round-shaped liquid-filled gelatin capsule, which looks like candy. Chewing or sucking of a single capsule can cause death of a small child. Signs and symptoms can occur rapidly after ingestion (within 15‚Äì20 minutes) and include restlessness, tremors, convulsions, coma, and cardiac arrest. Death has been reported within one hour of ingestion. = Pregnancy and breast feeding = In the U.S., benzonatate is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as pregnancy category C. It is not known if benzonatate can cause fetal harm to a pregnant woman or if it can affect reproduction capacity. Animal reproductive studies have not yet been conducted with benzonatate to evaluate its teratogenicity. Benzonatate should only be given to a pregnant woman if it is clearly needed. It is not known whether benzonatate is excreted in human milk. It is recommended to exercise caution when benzonatate is given to a nursing woman.  Overdose  Benzonatate is chemically similar to other local anesthetics such as tetracaine and procaine, and shares their pharmacology and toxicology. Benzonatate overdose is characterized by symptoms of restlessness, tremors, seizures, abnormal heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmia), cerebral edema, absent breathing (apnea), fast heart beat (tachycardia), and in severe cases, coma and death. Symptoms develop rapidly, typically within 1 hour of ingestion. Treatment focuses on removal of gastric contents and on managing symptoms of sedation, convulsions, apnea, and cardiac arrhythmia. Despite a long history of safe and appropriate usage, the safety margin of benzonatate is reportedly narrow. Toxicity above the therapeutic dose is relatively low and ingestion of a small handful of pills can cause symptoms of overdose. Children are at an increased risk for toxicity, which have occurred with administration of only one or two capsules. Due to increasing usage of benzonatate and rapid onset of symptoms, there are accumulating cases of benzonatate overdose deaths, especially in children. Pharmacology Benzonatate is chemically similar to other local anesthetics such as tetracaine and procaine, and shares their pharmacology. = Mechanism of action = Similar to other local anesthetics, benzonatate is a potent voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor. After absorption and circulation to the respiratory tract, benzonatate acts as a local anesthetic, decreasing the sensitivity of vagal afferent fibers and stretch receptors in the bronchi, alveoli, and pleura in the lower airway and lung. This dampens their activity and reduces the cough reflex. Benzonatate also has central antitussive activity on the cough center in central nervous system at the level of the medulla. However, there is minimal inhibition of the respiratory center at a therapeutic dosage. = Pharmacokinetics = The antitussive effect of benzonatate begins within 15 to 20 minutes after oral administration and typically lasts between 3 and 8 hours. Benzonatate is hydrolyzed by plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) to the metabolite 4-(butylamino)benzoic acid (BABA) as well as polyethylene glycol monomethyl esters. Like many other local anesthetic esters, the hydrolysis of the parent compound is rapid. There are concerns that those with pseudocholinesterase deficiencies may have an increased sensitivity to benzonatate as this hydrolysis is impaired, leading to increased levels of circulating medication. Chemical structure Benzonatate is a butylamine, structurally related to other polyglycol ester local anesthetics such as procaine and tetracaine. The molecular weight of benzonatate is 603.7 g/mol. However, the reference standard for benzonatate is a mixture of n-ethoxy compounds, differing in the abundance of 7-9 repeating units, with an average molecular weight of 612.23 g/mol. There is also evidence that the compound is not uniform between manufacturers.  Society and culture  Benzonatate was first made available in the U.S. in 1958 as a prescription medication for the treatment of cough in individuals over the age of 10. There are a variety of prescription opiate-based cough relievers, such as dextromethorphan and codeine, but have unwanted side effects and potential of abuse and diversion. However, benzonatate is currently the only prescription non-opioid antitussive and its usage has been rapidly increasing. The exact reasons of this increase are unclear. = Economics = In the United States between 2004 and 2009, prescriptions increased 50% from 3.1 million to 4.7 million, the market share of benzonatate among antitussives increased from 6.3% to 13%, and the estimated number of children under the age of 10 years receiving benzonatate increased from 10,000 to 19,000. Throughout this same period, greater than 90% of prescriptions were given to those 18 or older. The majority of prescriptions were given by general, family, internal, and osteopathic physicians wit pediatricians account for about 3% of prescribed benzonatate. In 2017, it was the 148th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than four million prescriptions. In the United States the wholesale cost of is about US$0.12 per 100 mg capsule and US$0.18 per 200 mg capsule. = Brand names = Tessalon is a brand name version of benzonatate manufactured by Pfizer, Inc. It is available as perles or capsules. Zonatuss was a brand name manufactured by Atley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Vertical Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The Swinger was an attempt by CBS (which had bought the company in 1965) to extract cash from inventory by combining unused bodies from the failed Fender Bass V with parts from the Fender Musicmaster. Another use of surplus stock was the Fender Custom (a.k.a. Fender Maverick). The Swinger was marketed as another cheaper, short-scale 'student' guitar, but never seriously promoted, with resulting low popularity. Development and design The Swinger and its cousin, the Custom, were both developed under the supervision of Virgilio 'Babe' Simoni, without the help or even involvement of Fender's R&D; Department. Simoni had begun work at Fender in 1953, at age 16. He had risen to Product Manager by the mid Sixties, and was both skilled and well-liked within the company. The Swinger used excess parts from the Fender Bass V and Fender Musicmaster, with the Bass V pickup routing hidden under the pickguard. Between 300 and 600 Swingers were produced, and the model never appeared in any Fender literature. Dating As the Swinger was built using parts that were surplus, the individual components may be older than the guitar. For example, the neck may be datestamped 1966. As far as is known, all Swingers were assembled in 1969. There are estimates that only 250 to 300 Swingers were ever produced. Users Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads used a Swinger in live performances, as seen in the concert movie Stop Making Sense. Ben Kweller used a Swinger to record most of his self-titled album, and has used it in concert. Lydia Night of The Regrettes uses a Swinger live and in the band's Seashore music video. John Smith of Mux used a swinger on the hit single We Need Love and the rest of that album.Mux Official Biography References Swinger ","title":"Fender Swinger"},{"id":"1783216","text":"Grant Mandel Rosenmeyer (born July 3, 1991) is an American actor and screenwriter best known for his roles in The Royal Tenenbaums and on the FOX television sitcom Oliver Beene.

He is one of the six mechanicals of Athens who perform the play which Quince himself authored, \\"The Most Lamentable Comedy and Most Cruel Death of Pyramus and Thisbe\\" for the Duke Theseus and his wife Hippolyta at their wedding. Titania's Fairies also watch from a distance: Moth, Peaseblossom, Cobweb and Mustardseed. His name is derived from \\"quines\\" or \\"quoins\\", which are wooden wedges used by carpenters. Characterization Quince's amateurish playwriting is usually taken to be a parody of the popular mystery plays of the pre-Elizabethan era, which were also produced by craftspeople. His metrical preferences refer to vernacular ballads. Despite Quince's obvious shortcomings as a writer, Stanley Wells argues that he partly resembles Shakespeare himself. Both are from a craftsmanly background, both work quickly and both take secondary roles in their own plays. Robert Leach makes the same point. In performing the play Quince recites the prologue but struggles to fit his lines into the meter and make the rhymes. The noble audience makes jocular comments, whilst the rest of the mechanicals struggle (except for Bottom, who rather confidently improvises). Traditionally, Peter Quince is portrayed as a bookish character, caught up in the minute details of his play, but as a theatrical organizer. However, in the 1999 film version of A Midsummer Night's Dream, he is portrayed by Roger Rees as a strong character extremely capable of being a director. It is he who leads the search party looking for Nick Bottom in the middle of the play. Cultural references The character is named in the title of a Wallace Stevens poem, \\"Peter Quince at the Clavier\\", which is written in the first person as if spoken by Quince.

His father, Hubert Dilger, was a United States Army captain who had received the Medal of Honor for his work as an artilleryman at the Battle of Chancellorsville (1863) during the American Civil War. Dilger eventually fled to Madrid, Spain, where he died during the 1918 flu pandemic.An American waged germ warfare against U.S. in WWI SFGate Early life and education Dilger was born in Front Royal, Virginia, to which his parents had moved from Ohio in the decades after the Civil War. He was educated in Germany after going there at the age of nine. He attended Gymnasium in Bensheim and trained as a physician in Heidelberg and Munich, later working for the University of Heidelberg surgical clinic while researching his doctoral dissertation. His dissertation involved growing animal cells in tissue culture, at which he was unsuccessful. He received his doctorate summa cum laude in 1912. Dilger was the grandson of anatomist Friedrich Tiedemann (1781‚Äì1861). Tiedemann was the Director of the Institute of Anatomy at Heidelberg University. He was also the cousin of Generalmajor Hubert Lamey (1896-1981), (Lamey was the Commander of the 118 Jager Division.) as well as General der Kavallerie, Carl-Erik Koehler (1895‚Äì1958). Koehler was the commander of the 20th Army Corps. Career There are reports that Dilger served as a surgeon in the Bulgarian Army during the Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913), that he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps, that he carried the rank of colonel in the Imperial German Army Medical Corps, and that he directed hospitals for the German Red Cross. These reports are unsubstantiated. =World War I= When World War I began, Dilger was in Germany, but he returned to the United States in 1915 with cultures of anthrax and glanders with the intention of biological sabotage on behalf of the German government's biological sabotage officer Rudolf Nadolny. The U.S. was then neutral, but Germany wanted to prevent neutral countries from supplying Allied forces with livestock, and the fact that Dilger had a U.S. passport from 1908 onwards made it easy for him to travel to and from America. Along with his brother Carl, Dilger established a laboratory in the Chevy Chase district north of Washington, DC in which cultures of the causative agents of anthrax and glanders‚ÄîBacillus anthracis and Burkholderia mallei‚Äîwere produced. A 1941 report reveals that the bacteria were to be painted onto the nostrils of horses. In the U.S., Baltimore stevedores, who were at first recruited by German officers to plant incendiary devices among ships and wharves, were eventually given bottles of liquid culture with orders to infect horses near Van Cortland Park. The stevedores claimed to have done the deed with rubber gloves and needles. The U.S. biological sabotage program is thought to have ended sometime in late-1916, after which time Anton returned to Germany. Upon his return to the U.S., Dilger found himself under suspicion of being a German agent by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and fled to Mexico, where he used the surname \\"Delmar\\". Sabotage program: nature and impact The United States was the only target of German biological sabotage to which Dilger traveled personally, but Romania, Norway, Spain, and South America were all wartime targets of the program. Dilger was the only known individual with the required medical knowledge to have presided over the program in Germany, even if he was not directly involved with each country. The methods of infecting livestock became more advanced as the war progressed, going from crude needles to capillary tubes of bacterial culture hidden inside sugar cubes. The effects of the German effort to sabotage neutral support of Allied countries is unknown. No reports have been made of disease outbreaks among livestock, so it is not yet known whether the cultures used were pathogenic or even viable. Certainly the amateurish method by which the U.S. stevedores infected horses would have given rise to accidents, but none were reported. That alone is cause for suspicion among researchers of the cultures used. Indeed, in the war treaties signed in the wake of World War I, no specific provisions were made for the prohibition of biological warfare, so it is presumed that officials either did not know about the German effort, or did not consider it a serious threat.His relative J√ºrgen Sch√∂fer, Ph.D. writes today about biosafety in science magazines.

J., Barnard, J., McKenzie, D. F., Thomson, R. M. & Suarez, M. F. (Eds.). (1999). The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain (Vol. 3). Cambridge University Press. Pg. 229. He was the nephew of Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury. He was born in Sherborne, Dorset, and was probably educated in Bourchier's household before being admitted to Eton College as a king's scholar about 1447. From Eton he passed to King's College, Cambridge, in 1451, and became a fellow there in 1454. In 1460 Doget was ordained, and gained his Master of Theology in 1464. In the same year he left Cambridge and went to Bologna, where he studied Canon law and earned his doctorate in 1469. He returned to Cambridge in 1463. Doget was sent to Rome to help arrange a peace between Pope Sixtus IV and Florence in 1479, dealing also with the princes of Sicily and Hungary. He was then appointed to an embassy to Christian I of Denmark. He was appointed domestic chaplain to Richard III in 1483. At some time between 1473 and 1486, he presented his Examinatorium in Phaedonem Platonis, the first philosophical work by an English humanist, to Cardinal Bourchier. The text of the Phaedo on which Doget comments is the translation of Leonardo Bruni. As Roberto Weiss has pointed out in the commentary, \\"his aim appears to have been an interpretation of some of Plato's passages as Christian maxims. Because of this he deals principally with an explanation of obscure passages in the Phaedo, which are presented so as to emphasize their common points with Christian doctrine\\" (Weiss, p. 166). The neoplatonic texts cited by Doget, which include Marsilio Ficino's Latin version of the Pimander, or Poemander, of Hermes Trismegistus, are seen through the prism of Christian apologetics, and the Phaedo was no doubt chosen in the first place as a vehicle for his commentary because it could be presented as a mythologized version of Christian doctrine. Doget's manuscript was later purchased by another humanist, Robert Sherborn, Bishop of Chichester. Henry VII presented him to the provostship of King's College in 1499. In 1500 he managed to obtain a licence from the King to impress men and boys into the King's College Choir, a much-needed privilege due to the complexity of polyphonic music at the time - skilled choir members were in high demand, Lady Margaret Beaufort having seized three clerks and a chorister from King's the year before Doget's appointment. His will is dated 4 March 1501 and bequeathed all his books on canon law and theology to King's College. He died the following month, and was buried in Salisbury Cathedral.

The 909 area code was split from area code 714 on November 14, 1992. By August 1993 use of the new area code became mandatory. Western Riverside County was split off from 909 into area code 951 on July 17, 2004. 909 still covers small portions of Corona, Riverside, and Moreno Valley, which are in Riverside County. Originally on the same date that 951 split off from 909, the area retaining the 909 area code was to be overlaid by a new area code 752. However, as a result of number pooling, this overlay plan was shelved before the 909/951 split, and 752 was returned to the NANPA numbering pool to be assigned at a later date. On July 23, 2019, the California Public Utilities Commission announced that the 909 area code would be overlaid with area code 840 from February 23, 2021. Permissive calling began in July 2020; once the overlay begins, recorded messages will inform callers should they dial incorrectly. 840 is California's 36th area code.

Hansen, who had joined the church in Boston. They focused most of their efforts in Denmark, but another convert had joined them, John E. Forsgren, who preached in Sweden.Deseret Morning News Church Almanac, p. 319.Mulder, William, Homeward to Zion (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1957). While serving as a missionary in Denmark, Snow baptized the first Icelanders to join the church, ordained them to the priesthood, and sent them to Iceland to preach.Larson, Karl Andrew, Erastus Snow: The Life of a Missionary and Pioneer for the Early Mormon Church (Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah Press, 1971) p. 225. Before the end of his mission, Snow began the publication of a church periodical in Danish. Later in the 1850s, Snow served as the presiding church authority in the midwest United States, using St. Louis as his headquarters. He returned to Utah Territory in 1857 and engaged in farming. In 1860, Snow went with Orson Pratt on a mission to the Eastern States. By the time they reached the Eastern United States, Abraham Lincoln had been elected president. With the impending war, they were able to convince many church members to move to Utah. Much of this migration happened in 1861 after the American Civil War had begun. After returning to Utah in 1861, Snow was made the apostle in charge of the Southern Utah Mormon settlements. He lived in St. George, and later founded Kingman and Snowflake, Arizona. Erastus Snow is known to have had four wives.Larson, Karl Andrew. Erastus Snow: The Life of a Missionary and Pioneer for the Early Mormon Church (Salt Lake City, Utah: University of Utah Press, 1971) pp. 744-755. One of Snow's daughters, Elizabeth, became the wife of Anthony W. Ivins and the mother of Antoine R. Ivins. Snow died at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, at age 69.

He served as the quorum's president from 1898 until his death. He was the nephew of apostle Willard Richards, one of two men who survived the mob attack at Carthage Jail that took the life of LDS Church founder, Joseph Smith. His son, George F. Richards, and grandson, LeGrand Richards, were both members of the quorum, while his son also served as president of the quorum from 1945 to 1950. Richards also served in the Utah Territorial Legislature in 1852 and 1856. Franklin County, Idaho, is named after Richards.Franklin County - Idaho.gov Biography Richards was born in Richmond, Massachusetts. He married Jane Snyder in Nauvoo, Illinois. After helping her and their children start on the Mormon exodus to the west in 1846, Richards and his brother, Samuel, departed on a mission to Great Britain. He served there as a missionary from 1846 to 1848, and on at least two more occasions, during the 1850s and 1860s. = Calling = Lyman Wight was excommunicated from the church in December 1848 because he refused to join the church in the Salt Lake Valley. This left an opening in the Quorum of the Twelve. To fill the vacancy, and to bring the number of the quorum up to twelve, Richards was called and ordained as the fourth of four apostles on February 12, 1849. The other three apostles were Charles C. Rich, Lorenzo Snow, and Erastus Snow. A short time after his call as a member of the Twelve, Richards went to England, where he served as president of the British Mission and then as president of the European Mission. In these positions, Richards also served as editor of the Millennial Star and as director of the Perpetual Emigrating Fund's operations in Europe. He helped compile the documents that are now part of the Pearl of Great Price while serving as a mission president. From 1889 until his death, Richards was the church's twelfth official Church Historian. = President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles = When Wilford Woodruff died on September 2, 1898, Snow succeeded him as church president. As the second apostle in seniority, Richards assumed the role of President of the Quorum of the Twelve. His term ended when he died fifteen months later. He was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve for more than 50 years, the longest tenure of any person who did not become the church's president. = Death = Richards suffered a stroke and paralysis in the autumn of 1899. He died peacefully in his home in Ogden, Utah, on December 9, 1899. The vacancy in the quorum created by his death was filled by Reed Smoot. Family The Richards family is only the third Latter- day Saint family in history with three consecutive generations in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, with his son, George F. Richards, and grandson, LeGrand Richards, also serving as church apostles.The other two families are the three-generation combination of George A. Smith, John Henry Smith, and George Albert Smith and the three-generation combination of Amasa M. Lyman, Francis M. Lyman, and Richard R. Lyman. Hyrum, Joseph F., and Joseph Fielding Smith were also three consecutive generations of apostles, but Hyrum was never a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Another grandson, Franklin D. Richards became a church general authority, serving as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve and later as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy. A daughter of Richards, Josephine Richards West, was a counselor in the general presidency of the Primary Association. Another descendant, Kent F. Richards, also served as a general authority seventy and transcribed the collection of journals created by Franklin D. Richards.

Bioerosion describes the breakdown of hard ocean substrates - and less often terrestrial substrates - by living organisms. Marine bioerosion can be caused by mollusks, polychaete worms, phoronids, sponges, crustaceans, echinoids, and fish; it can occur on coastlines, on coral reefs, and on ships; its mechanisms include biotic boring, drilling, rasping, and scraping. On dry land, bioerosion is typically performed by pioneer plants or plant-like organisms such as lichen, and mostly chemical (e.g. by acidic secretions on limestone) or mechanical (e.g. by roots growing into cracks) in nature. Bioerosion of coral reefs generates the fine and white coral sand characteristic of tropical islands. The coral is converted to sand by internal bioeroders such as algae, fungi, bacteria (microborers) and sponges (Clionaidae), bivalves (including Lithophaga), sipunculans, polychaetes, acrothoracican barnacles and phoronids, generating extremely fine sediment with diameters of 10 to 100 micrometres. External bioeroders include sea urchins (such as Diadema) and chitons. These forces in concert produce a great deal of erosion. Sea urchin erosion of calcium carbonate has been reported in some reefs at annual rates exceeding 20 kg/m2. Fish also erode coral while eating algae. Parrotfish cause a great deal of bioerosion using well developed jaw muscles, tooth armature, and a pharyngeal mill, to grind ingested material into sand-sized particles. Bioerosion of coral reef aragonite by parrotfish can range from 1017.7¬±186.3 kg/yr (0.41¬±0.07 m3/yr) for Chlorurus gibbus and 23.6¬±3.4 kg/yr (9.7 10‚àí3¬±1.3 10‚àí3 m2/yr) for Chlorurus sordidus (Bellwood, 1995). Bioerosion is also well known in the fossil record on shells and hardgrounds (Bromley, 1970), with traces of this activity stretching back well into the Precambrian (Taylor & Wilson, 2003). Macrobioerosion, which produces borings visible to the naked eye, shows two distinct evolutionary radiations. One was in the Middle Ordovician (the Ordovician Bioerosion Revolution; see Wilson & Palmer, 2006) and the other in the Jurassic (see Taylor & Wilson, 2003; Bromley, 2004; Wilson, 2007). Microbioerosion also has a long fossil record and its own radiations (see Glaub & Vogel, 2004; Glaub et al., 2007).

His tenure was interrupted for one week in 1901 when Joseph F. Smith was the president of the Quorum. Early life Young was born in Kirtland, Ohio, the son of Brigham Young and Mary Ann Angell. Young's twin sister, Mary, died at age seven from the effects of injuries received at age two in a wagon accident. At age twelve, Young drove an ox cart along the Mormon Trail, reaching Salt Lake City in 1848. Young served as a guard and scout in the following years, operating in Salt Lake Valley and the surrounding canyons. On November 15, 1855, Young married Catherine Curtis Spencer, a daughter of Orson Spencer, with exactly the same name as her mother. In Utah Territory, Young became a member of the reconstituted Nauvoo Legion. He was involved in the rescue of the Willie and Martin companies of Mormon handcart pioneers. He also served in the Utah War with the troops that worked to halt the advance of Johnston's Army.Flake, Lawrence R. \\"Brigham Young, Jr.\\" in Garr, Arnolds K., Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan, ed., Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret Book, 2000) p. 1379‚Äì80. In 1861, Young was made a member of the Salt Lake Stake high council. Early years as a general authority Brigham Young, Jr. between 1870 and 1875 Brigham Young Sr. ordained three of his sons, Brigham Young Jr., Joseph Angell Young and John Willard Young, as apostles in 1864, without public announcement or adding them to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Unlike his brothers, Brigham Young Jr. would later become part of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles four years later in 1868, after the death of Heber C. Kimball and George A. Smith joining the First Presidency. In 1868, he was also a Representative to the Territory of Utah Legislative Assembly. Young Jr. also served as a counselor to his father in the First Presidency of the church from April 8, 1873, until his father's death on August 29, 1877. Missions to Europe From 1862 to 1863, Young served as a church missionary in England, spending most of the time in London. During this time, he also accompanied Joseph F. Smith on a trip to Paris, France. In 1864, Young returned to Europe, this time with his wife, Catherine, as his companion. He was an assistant to mission president Daniel H. Wells. In 1865, when Wells left for Utah, Young succeeded him as president of the European Mission. Brigham and Catherine's son, Joseph Angel Young II, was born in England in 1866 while he was still serving as mission president.Susa Young Gates, \\"Genealogy of the Brigham Young Family\\", Utah Genealogical Register, Vol. 13 As president of the church's European Mission in 1866 and 1867, Young preached in France, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Russia, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Young also oversaw the emigration of British Latter-day Saints to Utah Territory.George Q. Cannon and Wilford Woodruff, Faith Promoting Series: Gems For the Young Folks, p. 19 It was from a conversation as Young was about to return to Utah at the end of his time as mission president that Charles W. Penrose wrote the hymn, \\"Beautiful Zion For Me\\".Heber J. Grant, Conference Report, April 1926, p. 147.

Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Provo, Utah: Brigham Young University Press, 1965) p. 89 The mission was headquartered in Liverpool, and Young directly supervised missionary work in the British Isles, while also serving as a leader over the mission presidents of the various missions on the European continent. Colonization and church assignment in America In the western United States, Young was involved in the colonization of Cache Valley, southern Utah and the extension of Mormon settlements into New Mexico and Arizona. Young was also involved at times with the Mormon colonies in Mexico. In 1867, Young was involved with the formation of the Deseret Sunday School Union to provide centralized direction to the Sunday schools of the church.Poleman, B. Lloyd. \\"Sunday School\\" in Ludlow, Daniel H., ed., Encyclopedia of Mormonism (New York: MacMillan, 1992) p. 1425 During 1868, Young acted as his father's agent in finding workers for the Utah portion of the First Transcontinental Railroad. From 1869 until 1877, Young presided over the Latter-day Saints in Cache Valley, closely assisted by William B. Preston, who was serving as the regional presiding bishop.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News Press, 1941, p. 105.

In 1857, Young married his second wife, Jane Carrington, a daughter of Albert Carrington. Young's wife Abigail Stevens was one of his younger wives. Their daughter Klara Young Cheney, born in Fruitland, New Mexico, in 1894, turned 100 years old in 1994.Church News, 1994-12-24. Abigail and Brigham Jr.'s last daughter, Marian Young, was also born at Fruitland on January 25, 1899. She died on November 22, 2004, less than two months short of her 106th birthday. She was the last grandchild of Brigham Young to die.Church News, 2004-12-04, p. Z12. Politics Young served several terms in the Utah Territorial Legislature. President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles Young was ordained an apostle before Joseph F. Smith but was not placed in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until after Joseph F. Smith.Smith was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on October 8, 1867, while Young was sustained to the Quorum on October 9, 1868. It was not until 1900 that a clear decision was made which gave Smith seniority in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles over Young, since Smith had been a member of the First Presidency since becoming an apostle.Cowan, Richard O. The Church in the 20th Century. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft, 1985) p. 14 Young had served as the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles since the previous president, Franklin D. Richards, had died on December 9, 1899. When church president Lorenzo Snow died on October 10, 1901, Smith served as President of the Quorum until he was made church president on October 17, 1901. The death of Snow dissolved the First Presidency, returning First Counselor Joseph F. Smith to the Quorum of the Twelve as President of the Quorum. The LDS Church at that time did not draw a distinction between President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In that time, the person who in the modern church would be called the Acting President was set apart as the President of the Quorum. The second-most senior apostle was not set apart as the President of the Quorum if they were a member of the First Presidency, which Smith was. One week later, Smith was made President of the Church and Young again became President of the Quorum. Therefore, when Smith became president, Young again assumed the position of President of the Quorum of the Twelve. Young is the only person to have served two non-consecutive terms as President of the Quorum. Death alt=Brigham Young Jr.'s grave marker. Young died in Salt Lake City, Utah at age 66.

The Carringtons were baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Wiota, Wisconsin, on July 18, 1841, and in 1844 moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, to join the gathering of Latter Day Saints. In January 1846, Carrington took Mary Rock as a plural wife. Following the death of Joseph Smith, Carrington followed Brigham Young to the Salt Lake Valley. In Utah Territory Carrington was the editor of the LDS Church-owned Deseret News from 1854 to 1856 and again from 1862 until 1867. He was elected multiple times to the Legislative Council in the Utah territorial legislature until 1868. While serving as Brigham Young's secretary, in 1849 Carrington was hired by Howard Stansbury to make a survey of the Great Salt Lake. Carrington accompanied Stansbury to Washington, D.C., in 1850 to report on the expedition's efforts and returned to Utah in 1851.. Church service Carrington became an apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve on July 3, 1870. He was the president of the European Mission four times‚Äîonce prior to becoming an apostle (1868‚Äì70) and three times as an apostle (1871‚Äì73, 1875‚Äì77, 1880‚Äì82). Carrington was the tenth official Church Historian of the LDS Church between 1871 and 1874. From 1873 until 1877, he was a counselor to Young in the First Presidency and served as Young's personal secretary for more than 20 years. Excommunication and readmission Carrington was excommunicated from the LDS Church by the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles on November 7, 1885, for adultery, fornication, and \\"lewd and lascivious conduct\\". Carrington's extramarital relationships had begun in England while he was the mission president; he had hid these relationships from the leaders of the church for over 10 years and had lied to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles about them when rumors about Carrington began spreading. (The Salt Lake Tribune first accused Carrington of adultery in 1875.)Brigham D. Madsen, \\"Carrington, Albert\\" , Utah History Encyclopedia, uen.org. In 1885, Carrington argued before the Twelve that because he did not ejaculate inside the women he had sexual relations with, he had technically not committed adultery, but had simply committed \\"a little folly in Israel\\". The Quorum disagreed and excommunicated him. Carrington was rebaptized on November 1, 1887. Upon his rebaptism, he was not reinstated as an apostle or as a general authority. On his deathbed, Carrington received permission to be ordained an elder so that he could be buried in his temple robes. He died before the ordination could take place; Wilford Woodruff, the president of the church, authorized that he be ordained 15 minutes after his death. Carrington died at Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, at age 76, and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

He was one of only a few members of the Quorum of the Twelve to be dropped from the Quorum but to remain in good standing in the church and retain the priesthood office of apostle. Early life Thatcher was born in Sangamon County, Illinois, to Hezekiah Thatcher and Alena Kitchen. The Thatcher family joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 1843, and moved to Macedonia, Illinois, and later to Nauvoo. Together, with the main body of the church, they began their trek westward in 1846 and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. Hezekiah and Alena, with seven of their eight living children (including Thatcher), departed for California in 1849, seeking to acquire wealth through the Gold Rush. They returned to Utah Territory in 1857. Thatcher was called to serve a mission for the church at age 15, from which he returned in 1858. In 1859, the family settled in Cache Valley, where Thatcher helped Hezekiah locate canal and mill sites. From 1860 to 1861, Thatcher studied at the University of Deseret. From 1866 to 1868, he served a second mission, this one to the United Kingdom and France. He later served as the church's first mission president in Mexico. Apostolic service Thatcher was called to be an apostle and a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in April 1879. He was called to replace Orson Hyde, who died on November 28, 1878. From 1880 to 1898, Thatcher was the second assistant to Wilford Woodruff in the superintendency of the Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association (YMMIA). At the April 1896 General Conference of the church, Thatcher was dropped from the Quorum of the Twelve in consequence of his not being \\"in harmony\\" with the other leaders of the church about a proposed policy called \\"The Political Rule of the Church,\\" commonly referred to as \\"the political Manifesto.\\" This policy would have required that the general authorities of the church to obtain the approval of the First Presidency before seeking public office. This statement was signed by all the apostles at the time except Thatcher, who refused on grounds of conscience, citing the church's long-standing position on political neutrality. (Apostle Anthon Lund also did not sign the document due to his absence while presiding over the church's European Mission.)B. H. Roberts, Comprehensive History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints 6:330‚Äì36. However, Thatcher was not excommunicated from the church and retained his position in the leadership of the YMMIA. Thatcher remained supportive of the church after being removed from the Quorum, testifying on many occasions of the divinity of the work and the divinity of the calling of its leaders. Matthias F. Cowley was called to replace Thatcher in the Quorum of the Twelve. Thatcher held the priesthood office of apostle until his death. Post-Quorum of the Twelve service After being removed from the quorum, Thatcher testified in the Reed Smoot hearings held before the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections. He was supportive of the church and its positions. Thatcher died at his home on August 21, 1909 in Logan, Utah. He is buried in the Logan Cemetery.

He was the President of the Quorum of the Twelve from 1903 until his death. Lyman's father and son were also apostles in the church: his father was Amasa M. Lyman and his son was Richard R. Lyman. Both his father and son were excommunicated from the church while serving as apostles (although they were later re-baptized). Early life Francis M. Lyman was born as the first son of Amasa M. Lyman and Louisa Maria Tanner in Good Hope, Illinois. That spring, the family moved to Iowa. About one year later, they moved to Nauvoo, Illinois, to be with the main gathering of Latter Day Saints. In 1843, they moved again to Alquina, Indiana. In 1844, after the death of Joseph Smith, they moved back to Nauvoo. Lyman's father left with the first group to travel on the Mormon Exodus to the West. His family moved to Winter Quarters in June 1846 under the care of his maternal grandfather. His family set out to the Salt Lake Valley in 1848. Though only 8 years old, Lyman helped drive a yoke of cattle and the wagon. He was baptized by his father in the Elkhorn River on July 1, 1848, and arrived in the Salt Lake Valley on October 19, 1848. By 1851, when Lyman was 11 years old, his father and Charles C. Rich purchased land in San Bernardino, California. Lyman helped drive the animals from Salt Lake to southern California. Lyman was present at the laying of the cornerstone of the Salt Lake Temple on April 6, 1853. Adult life and service In 1856, at about 16 years of age, Lyman received the Melchizedek priesthood and was ordained an elder by his father. In 1857, he was called on a mission to Great Britain. He was stopped at Salt Lake City and told to turn back to bring the settlers in California to Utah. The outbreak of the Utah War had prevented his mission. Lyman married Rhoda Ann Taylor on November 18, 1857. In 1859, Lyman and his family settled in Farmington, Utah. He was ordained to a seventy on January 7, 1860, by John S. Gleason. He built a cabin in Beaver, Utah, for his wife and son, and he left on his delayed mission in the spring of 1860. Mission in England En route to New York City, Lyman stopped in Kirtland, Ohio, and was shown through the Kirtland Temple by Martin Harris. Lyman left the United States through the port of New York and arrived by steamer in Liverpool, England, on July 27, 1860. Lyman served as a missionary for roughly two years. Upon release from his mission, he accompanied about 800 immigrants back to the United States; they arrived in New York on June 25, 1862, where he was appointed the president of the group. By early July, they had arrived in Florence, Nebraska. Lyman was reunited with his wife in Beaver, Utah, in the middle of October. Fillmore In March 1863, LDS Church president Brigham Young asked Lyman to settle in Fillmore, Utah. The next fourteen years of his life were spent there, where he engaged himself in leadership in church, politics, business, and manufacturing. Among his positions and honors were: *assistant assessor of United States internal revenue *lieutenant-colonel of the first regiment of militia in the Pauvan District at 25 *member of the House of the General Assembly of the State of Deseret *a member of the 17th, 18th, 22nd and 23rd sessions of the Utah Territorial legislature *county clerk and recorder *superintendent of schools *prosecuting attorney When a stake was formed in Fillmore, Lyman was ordained to the office of high priest. Later he was called to be a member of the stake high council. On October 4, 1869, Lyman married his first plural wife, Clara Caroline Callister. Her grandfather was John Smith, Joseph Smith's uncle. Lyman and Callister's son Richard R. Lyman would serve as an apostle from 1918 to 1943. Lyman was called on a second mission to England and left Salt Lake City on October 20, 1873, arriving in Liverpool on November 12. During this mission, he also visited and proselytized in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland, and France. He returned to Utah with 300 immigrating Latter-day Saints in October 1875. Tooele County In April 1877, Lyman was called to preside over the Tooele Stake, which was organized June 24, 1877, in Tooele County, Utah. He involved himself in the politics of that county as well. By August 1878, Lyman was elected county recorder and representative to the territorial legislature. Since 1874, Tooele County had been led by politicians of the Liberal Party and was nicknamed the Tooele Republic. In 1878, the legislature passed a resolution providing for the registration of voters. After allegations of corruption and excessive spending by the Liberal Party, which left the county in debt, the People's Party won the election of 1878. However, Liberal Party officials refused to count the votes and declared themselves the winners of the election. Lyman was key in challenging the election results. After the case was heard by the courts, the People's Party was declared the winner on March 29, 1879. As a result of his victory in this instance, Lyman had earned a reputation for fighting government corruption. Apostleship At the October General Conference held on October 10, 1880, Lyman and John Henry Smith were sustained as members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. Because he was absent from the conference on a mission to survey parts of southern Utah, Nevada, and Arizona, Lyman was ordained an apostle on October 27 by church president John Taylor. Lyman visited nearly every town in the West with members of the church during his apostleship. He also maintained a detailed daily record of his business as an apostle. In early 1883, Lyman served a mission to the Native American people of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in Utah. With his company of men, Lyman set out and preached vigorously. The government agents were receptive and allowed them to preach freely. Members of the Utes had joined them, and they were most effective in preaching to their fellow natives. Many Native Americans received the Book of Mormon and their preaching and were baptized. Lyman returned to Provo, Utah, on May 28, 1883. Lyman was called to minister over the European Mission in 1901. He set about several key reforms and expanded the number of mission homes throughout Europe. In 1903, Lyman and Joseph J. Cannon visited and preached in Finland and Russia. In spring 1902, Lyman visited Palestine and offered up a solemn prayer on the Mount of Olives. In 1903, Brigham Young, Jr. died, making Lyman the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. He returned to Utah in 1904. Soon after returning home, he went to Washington, D.C., to testify in the Reed Smoot hearings before the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections. Lyman died in his home of pneumonia on November 18, 1916.State of Utah Death Certificate . Stephen L Richards was called to replace him in the Quorum of the Twelve after his death. Heber J.

He was a prominent politician in Utah and played an important role in the transition from Utah as a territory to a state of the United States.  LDS Church service  From 1867 until 1869 Smith served as a counselor in the bishopric of the Provo 4th Ward, which at that time covered all Provo north of Center Street and east of 1st East. In 1874 and 1875, Smith served as a missionary in Europe. He spent most of this mission in England, particularly in and around the city of Birmingham. From 1875 to 1880, Smith was the bishop of the Salt Lake 17th Ward. In October 1880, LDS Church president John Taylor called Smith to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. On October 27 of that year, he was ordained an apostle by Wilford Woodruff, who at that time was the quorum president. Smith served in that capacity until the death of First Presidency member John R. Winder in 1910; he was then asked by church president Joseph F. Smith to take Winder's place as a member of the First Presidency. John Henry Smith served in this capacity until his death the next year.  Political contributions  Smith was a prominent Republican in Utah politics. In 1882, he was elected a member of the Utah Territorial Legislature. Smith was unanimously elected by the 107 delegates to be the Chair of the Utah Constitutional Convention that was held between March 4 and May 8, 1895. The result of the Convention was a draft Constitution for the proposed State of Utah, which was accepted by the United States Congress in 1896 when Utah officially became a state of the United States.  Marriage and family  Born in Carbunca, Iowa, Smith was the son of Sarah Ann Libby and LDS Church apostle and First Presidency member, George A. Smith. He came west to Utah in a company co-led by his father in 1849, arriving in Salt Lake City on October 27, 1849. His mother died in 1851. Smith practiced plural marriage and was the father of 19 children. One of his sons was George Albert Smith, who became an LDS apostle and served as the church's 8th president. Smith and George Albert Smith are the only father and son pair to have been members of the Quorum of the Twelve at the same time, serving together from 1903 to 1910. Smith was also the father of Nicholas G. Smith. Smith's first wife, Sarah Farr, was the daughter of Lorin Farr, who was mayor of Ogden, Utah. Smith's second wife, Josephine Groesbeck, spent 1888 until 1896 in exile in Manassa, Colorado, to avoid being called as a witness in a criminal unlawful cohabitation trial against Smith.article on polygamy exiles in Manassa Death Smith died of a pulmonary hemorrhage in Salt Lake CityState of Utah Death Certificate . and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. file:JohnGeorgeSmithsMonumentFront.jpgMonument to four generations of a branch of the Smith family, prominent in LDS history. file:JohnGeorgeSmithsMonumentBack.jpgBack of monument. file:JohnHSmithGrave.jpgHeadstone of John H.

Dalton had a hit song in the 1980s about one of the streets, 16th Avenue, while the area served as namesake to Dolly Parton's 1973 composition \\"Down on Music Row\\". Sometimes the term \\"Music Row\\" is used as a metonymous nickname for the music industry as a whole, just as \\"Madison Avenue\\" often refers to the advertising industry. In present years, the district has been marked for extensive historical preservation and local as well as national movements to revive its rich and vibrant history. A group dedicated to this mission is the Music Industry Coalition. Points of interest Historic sites such as RCA's famed Studio B and Studio A, where hundreds of notable and famous musicians have recorded, are situated on Music Row. Country music entertainers Roy Acuff and Chet Atkins have also been memorialized with streets named in their honor within the area. The Country Music Hall of Fame was once located at the corner of Music Square East and Division Street, but the building has since been torn down and the museum moved to a new state-of-the-art building eleven blocks away in Downtown Nashville in June of 1999. One area of Music Row, along Demonbreun Street, was once littered with down-market tourist attractions and vanity \\"museums\\" of various country music stars. These began to disappear in the late 1990s with the announced move of the Country Music Hall of Fame. The strip sat largely vacant for a few years but has been recently redeveloped with a number of upscale restaurants and bars serving the Downtown and Music Row areas. At the confluence of Demonbreun Street, Division Street, 16th Avenue South, and Music Square East is the \\"Music Row Roundabout,\\" a circular intersection designed to accommodate a continuous flow of traffic. Flanking the intersection to the west is Owen Bradley Park, a very small park dedicated to notable songwriter, performer, and publisher Owen Bradley. Within the park is a life-size bronze statue of Bradley behind a piano. Inside the roundabout is a large statue called the \\"Musica\\". At the other end of Music Row, across Wedgewood Avenue sits the Belmont University campus, and Vanderbilt University is also adjacent to the area. Belmont is of particular note because of its Mike Curb College of Entertainment & Music Business (CEMB), part of Belmont University and a major program in its commercial music performance division.

In musical composition, a sound mass (also sound collective, sound complex, tone shower, sound crowd, or cloud) is the result of compositional techniques, in which, \\"the importance of individual pitches,\\" is minimized, \\"in preference for texture, timbre, and dynamics as primary shapers of gesture and impact,\\" obscuring, \\"the boundary between sound and noise\\" . Techniques which may create or be used with sound mass include extended techniques such as muted brass or strings, flutter tonguing, wide vibrato, extreme ranges, and glissandos as the continuum for \\"sound mass\\" moves from simultaneously sounding notes ‚Äì clusters etc., towards stochastic cloud textures, and 'mass structure' compositional textures which evolve over time . In a sound mass, \\"the traditional concept of 'chord' or vertical 'event' [is] replaced by a shifting, iridescent fabric of sound\\" . The use of \\"chords approaching timbres\\" begins with Debussy and Edgard Var√®se often carefully scored individual instrumental parts so that they would fuse into one ensemble timbre or sound mass . Explored by Charles Ives and Henry Cowell in the early part of the twentieth century, this technique also developed from the modernist tone clusters and spread to orchestral writing by the mid 1950s and 1960s . \\"Unlike most tonal and non-tonal linear dissonances, tone clusters are essentially static. The individual pitches are of secondary importance; it is the sound mass that is foremost\\" . One French composer active in this period whose music takes a sound-mass approach directly influenced by both Debussy and Var√®se is Maurice Ohana . Examples Examples can be found in Metastasis (1953‚Äì54), Pithoprakta (1955‚Äì56), and Achorripsis (1956‚Äì57), all orchestral works by Iannis Xenakis , as well as in Gesang der J√ºnglinge for concrete and electronic sounds (1955‚Äì56), Zeitma√üe for five woodwinds (1955‚Äì56), and Gruppen for three orchestras (1955‚Äì57), by Karlheinz Stockhausen . Other composers and works include Barbara Kolb, Pauline Oliveros' Sound Patterns for chorus (1961), Norma Beecroft's From Dreams of Brass for chorus (1963‚Äì1964), and Nancy Van de Vate. Beecroft \\"blurs individual pitches in favor of a collective timbre through the use of vocal and instrumental clusters, choral speech, narrator, and a wash of sounds from an electronic tape\\" . A very early example is the opening of Jean-F√©ry Rebel's ballet Les El√©mens (1737‚Äì38), where chaos is represented by a gradually cumulating orchestral cluster of all seven notes of the D minor scale . A later example is the third movement of Ruth Crawford Seeger's String Quartet 1931 (recorded on Nonesuch H-71280) while more recently Phill Niblock's multiple drone based music serves as an example . Other examples include European \\"textural\\" compositions of the fifties and sixties such as Krzysztof Penderecki's Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima (1959) and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti's works featuring micropolyphony in works like Atmosph√®res (1961) and his Requiem (1963‚Äì65) . Other composers with works using this technique include Henryk G√≥recki, Karel Husa, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Kazimierz Serocki, Steven Stucky, and George Crumb .

He was killed in a motorcycle accident a few days after the end of the Second World War, when Norma was just three years old, and her mother subsequently reverted to using her maiden name, so she was known as Norma Johnson growing up. The young Norma was educated at a boarding school in Bexhill-on-Sea, Oakfield Preparatory School in Dulwich, and Peckham School for Girls where she was head girl. She was a skilled dressmaker. She was also a member of the Young Conservatives. At a Conservative Party meeting during the campaign for the 1970 Greater London Council elections, she was introduced to John Major. The couple married on 3 October 1970. They have a son together, James Major, and a daughter, Elizabeth Major. She kept a low profile during the time her husband was in office as Prime Minister (1990‚Äì1997), doing charity work and writing two books, Chequers: The Prime Minister's Country House and its History (1997) and Joan Sutherland: The Authorised Biography (1994).

They play in red shirts, shorts and socks. Their nickname is 'The Tigers' (or in Portuguese \\"Tigr√£o\\" which roughly translates \\"Big Tiger\\"). The club won the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie C in 2015 and 1996. Vila Nova's greatest rival is Goi√°s. History In 1943 the club was founded as Vila Nova Futebol Clube. Three years later, in 1946, the club changed its name to Oper√°rio. In 1949 the club changed its name to Araguaia, then in 1950 it was renamed to F√™nix Futebol Clube and in 1955 the club changed its name to its current name, Vila Nova Futebol Clube. In 1961 Vila Nova won their first state championship. In 1977 the team debuted in Campeonato Brasileiro and finished in 55th place. From 1977 to 1980, Vila Nova was state champion in four successive seasons. In 1996 the club won the Campeonato Brasileiro Third Division without losing a single match. In 1999, Vila Nova competed for the first time in an international competition, the Copa CONMEBOL but was eliminated in the first round, becoming the first Goi√°s state team to play in an international competition. In 2000, the club won the Campeonato Goiano Second Division after being excluded from the league as a result of forfeiting the final match, and in 2001 and 2005, the club won the Campeonato Goiano. In 2006, it was relegated to the S√©rie C, returning to the S√©rie B in the following year. In 2011, the team was relegated again to the S√©rie C, being promoted to the Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B in 2013. However, in 2014, it was relegated in the state championship.

Supporters Like all Brazilian football teams, Vila Nova has their own group of die-hard fans who call themselves 'TEV' ‚Äì Torcida Esquadr√£o Vilanovense (usually referring to themselves as simply 'Esquadr√£o'). Many members of TEV come from an area of Goi√°nia called Zona Leste which is notorious for its crime rate. A popular song sung by TEV at Vila games is: :Vila, Vila, Vila minha vida, :Vila, Vila minha hist√≥ria, :Vila, Vila meu amor! English translation :Vila, Vila, Vila my life, :Vila, Vila my history, :Vila, Vila my love! Rivals Vila Nova's greatest rival is Goi√°s, with whom there is constant argument about which club has the largest fanbase. A common view is the claim that Vila Nova has the largest fanbase in Goi√¢nia, and Goi√°s has the largest fanbase in Goi√°s state. Some Goi√°s supporters claim their club has also the biggest number of fans in Goi√¢nia. Either way Vila Nova has an estimated fanbase of about 350,000, which is pretty big for a Brazilian second tier club. In the 2011 S√©rie B season, Vila Nova will play Goi√°s (after Goias were relegated from S√©rie A in 2010) for the first time in the S√©rie B since 1998. They also encounter each other every year during the Campeonato Goiano (state championship). During a game on May 1, 2011 at the Serra Dourada, both teams were involved in a mass brawl on and off the pitch after the Campeonato Goiano semifinal.

At the beginning of each video, Tim reads a letter from a student asking about the topic.\\"Ways to Use BrainPop at Home\\" , Brainpop, 2007, accessed March 31, 2012 Often at the end of the movies, Moby will humorously annoy Tim, or vice versa.Brainpop movies and profiles of Tim and Moby at Sparktop.org = Moby = Moby the Robot is an orange robot who communicates in beeping noises. The three lights on his chest light up when he beeps, and Tim usually translates what he's saying. Moby is Tim's friend but loves to drive him crazy. Moby helps out by fetching things for Tim and asking questions about the topic they are discussing. As a robot, he can do things that people are unable to do, such as changing his hand into a freeze-ray, sending himself back in time, throwing garbage into a black hole in space, removing his head, and using lasers. Some of the movies, such as the Earth, Radar and Milky Way videos, imply that Moby is of an extraterrestrial origin. However, the Leonardo da Vinci movie implies that he was invented by da Vinci. = Other characters = Cassie and Rita are two teenage girls, who are best friends and are mainly featured in comics that accompany many of the movies in the \\"FYI\\" section. They also occasionally appear in the main movies and even narrate a few of them. Rita tends to be more composed and intelligent, while Cassie tends to be more absent-minded. Like Moby, Cassie enjoys annoying Tim, while some of the movies imply that Rita has a romantic interest in Tim and that he returns her feelings. Bob is a rat with a broken tail and a patched chest. He is featured in, and often conducts, experiments called \\"Experiments with Bob the Ex-Lab Rat\\", which relate to mostly science movies. Gary and gary are a father and son featured in comics called \\"How To With Gary and gary\\", which show how to do something safely.

Early years Thornton grew up in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, in a family of athletes, and graduated from Phoenixville Area High School. In 1967, a week before his 18th birthday, the Philadelphia Phillies signed Thornton as an amateur free agent. He played Minor League Baseball in the Phillies organization from 1967 through 1972. In 1972, the Phillies traded Thornton to the Atlanta Braves, who traded him to the Chicago Cubs the following year. Major league career =Chicago Cubs= Thornton made his major-league debut with the Cubs on July 28, 1973, as a pinch hitter. He collected his first hit on August 3, in a win over the Montreal Expos. He was named to the 1974 All-Rookie Team as a first baseman by Baseball Digest. Thornton had one of his best seasons in 1975; although his 18 home runs were only the seventh-best season total of his career, he hit .293 with a .428 on-base percentage and a slugging percentage of .516. It was the first of six seasons during his career in which Thornton walked more than he struck out. Thornton played for the Cubs until May 1976, appearing in 271 games with a batting average of .267 with 30 home runs and 122 RBIs. =Montreal Expos= Thornton was traded to Montreal on May 17, 1976, for Larry Biittner and Steve Renko. He played in 69 games for Montreal through the end of the season. Overall for 1976, in which he battled injuries, Thornton hit .194 with 11 home runs and 38 RBIs. On December 10, the Expos traded Thornton to the Cleveland Indians for pitcher Jackie Brown. The trade would prove to be one of the most lopsided deals of the 1970s, as Brown would only pitch one more year in the majors. =Cleveland Indians= Thornton sustained high levels of production through much of his Cleveland career. After hitting 28 home runs in 1977, his debut season in Cleveland, Thornton hit a career- high 33 home runs in 1978 (a total he would match in 1984). In 1979, he was honored with the Roberto Clemente Award, given to the player who best exemplifies the game of baseball, sportsmanship, community involvement, and team contribution. Thornton missed all of 1980 with a severe knee injury that required two surgeries, and all but 69 games in 1981 due to other injuries. From 1981 to 1984, Thornton played primarily as a designated hitter. In 1982, Thornton hit 32 home runs and batted in 116 runs, a career high; he also had 109 walks. From 1982 through 1986, a healthy Thornton appeared in an average of 140 games each season, and hit a total of 121 home runs with 446 RBIs while hitting for a .261 average. He won a Silver Slugger Award as a designated hitter in 1984, and then played exclusively as a designated hitter from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, he started 12 of the first 20 games, but injuries and a decision to essentially bench him kept him out of all but 24 games for the rest of the season, including only seven starts. He retired after the season. Overall, in his ten seasons with the Indians, Thornton appeared in 1225 games, batting .254 with 214 home runs and 749 RBIs. He spent most of his career as one of the few marquee players on a team that was usually barely competitive; he only played on a winning team twice (not counting the strike year of 1981) during his time in Cleveland. He later said that while the Indians had some very good players, management simply couldn't keep them in Cleveland for any period of time.Doyle, Al. Where are they now? Baseball Digest, September 2002. =Career stats= Thornton was selected as an American League All-Star in 1982 and 1984. He finished his career with 244 doubles, 253 home runs, a batting average of .254, an on-base percentage of .360, and a slugging percentage of .452. For three seasons, he was in the top 5 in home runs in his league, and he was in his league's top 5 in walks four times. Thornton finished his career with more bases on balls (876) than strikeouts (851). Personal life In 1977, Thornton and his son Andy (Andr√© Jr.) were injured in an automobile accident that took the life of his wife Gertrude and three- year-old daughter Theresa Gertrude. In 1983 he wrote a book, Triumph Born of Tragedy, which is an account of the accident and his Christian faith. In 1979, Thornton married Gail Jones, a gifted singer and former member of The Jones Sisters Trio gospel group. In addition to Andr√© Jr., the couple have two other sons, Jonathan and Dean. Today, Thornton is a successful businessman. He is president and CEO of ASW Global, a supply chain management company. The Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to a Major League Baseball player who demonstrates sportsmanship and community involvement, was presented to Thornton in 1979. After his playing career, Thornton continued to be involved in the Cleveland community, sitting on the boards of the Cleveland Council on World Affairs, the Cleveland Zoological Society, the Cuyahoga Community College Fund and Nyack College. Additionally as a member of Leadership Cleveland, and through involvement with The First Tee of Cleveland, a golf program which is geared to provide youth with educational programs and facilities that promote character development. In August 2007, Thornton was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame along with Jim Bagby, Sr., Mike Garcia, and Charles Nagy. Thornton is also a member of the minor league Reading Phillies Hall of Fame. The Indians also named Thornton as a member of their \\"Top 100 Greatest Indians.\\" Andre Thornton Park, on the north side of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, opened in August 2010.

Two trains entered a crossing loop simultaneously in opposing directions, although signals at the exit from the crossing loop were correctly showing red for stop. Overview The trains involved were National Rail Corporation's 5SP5 intermodal Sydney to Perth freighter, and Westrail's 7025 Perth to Kalgoorlie freighter. The National Rail train in one direction misjudged the stop, and went past the red signal, hitting the last wagons of the Westrail train. These wagons were tankers containing diesel which burst into flames, destroying the train data recorders that might have explained what speed the train was travelling at. Locomotive AN10 was derailed. The driver and a teenage guest passenger were killed. Another person received severe injuries. National Rail locomotives AN10 and DL37 were written off due to being damaged beyond repair. A relay control room which was close to the fire was also destroyed. The accident happened at night, and there were no distance boards which might have helped the driver of the NR train judge the distance to the stop signal showing red. Aftermath In June 1998, Westrail was fined $95,000 with $85,000 in costs. An appeal heard in the Supreme Court of Western Australia set aside the original conviction and Westrail was awarded $23,000 in costs. The signalling was later altered to prevent trains entering the crossing loop simultaneously. The accident illustrates the hazard of having crossing loops only just long enough to hold the two trains. If the loop had been longer, the safety distance from the red departure signal to the fouling point with the arriving train would have been larger and the other train would have cleared the single line section so avoiding the collision by some vital seconds. =Loop lengthening= Since the accident, the crossing loop at Hines Hill has been lengthened for longer 1,800 m trains. The loop is now 2,304 m long, which is considerably longer than the normal longest train. The extra distance provides both a safety margin and faster crosses, since a train entering the loop can clear the single line at a higher speed. It is not known if the simultaneous arrival signalling has been restored. The extra distance is to accommodate longer trains and has nothing to do with faster crossings as have other crossing loops on the Avon to Kalgoorlie Line See also *Railway accidents in Western Australia References 1996 in Australia Railway accidents in 1996 Railway accidents and incidents in Western Australia Wheatbelt (Western Australia) Railway accidents involving a disregarded signal Accidents and incidents involving National Rail Corporation 1990s in Western Australia ","title":"Hines Hill train collision"},{"id":"1783450","text":"The Warrnambool line is a regional passenger rail service operated by V/Line in Victoria, Australia. It serves passengers between the state capital, Melbourne, and the regional city of Warrnambool. History In 1993 passenger services on the line were contracted by the State Government to a private company, West Coast Railway. That arrangement lasted until 2004, when the contract was handed back to the government, and V/Line resumed the operation of Warrnambool services.

Each -bound service operates to different stopping patterns; however, all services operate express between Southern Cross and Lara, with an intermediate stop at Footscray. On weekends, most services stop at all stations between Warrnambool and , but some services operate express on part of the journey. is only served by two of the three Southern Cross-bound services each day. All services operate express between Deer Park and Footscray, and between Footscray and Southern Cross. Warrnambool trains are classified by V/Line as a long-distance service, so first-class accommodation is available and an on-board snack bar is provided. Locomotive-hauled N-class carriages are used. In December 2018, due to a lack of available rollingstock, H carriages were used on the line past Geelong for the first time. After 22 December 2013, following the opening of the first section of the Regional Rail Link (RRL) from Southern Cross to South Kensington, Warrnambool services no longer stopped at North Melbourne station. From 12 October 2014, V/Line Warrnambool train services began stopping at the new Waurn Ponds station as part of the extension of Geelong line services to that location. On 21 June 2015, the new RRL line from Manor Junction to Deer Park West opened. Consequently, Warrnambool trains began to run via Wyndham Vale and Tarneit stations, rather than via Werribee and Newport stations on the Werribee Line. From 29 January 2017, V/Line started running a fourth service in both directions on weekdays, and Sunday road coach services were replaced by trains, so that three Sunday train services run in both directions instead of two. Following a timetable change on 27 August 2017, weekday Warrnambool trains no longer serve Wyndham Vale or Tarneit stations. In 2019, upgrades are scheduled to be completed that will allow V/Locity railcars to travel to Warrnambool. These upgrades include new signalling, level crossing upgrades and a crossing loop at Boorcan, near Camperdown.

It was started by Lawrence C. FalkKentucky Senate Resolution on Lonnie Falk's death (Microsoft Word document) (commonly known as Lonnie Falk) and was published from July 1981 to May 1993Rainbow Magazine section of The Rainbow's On-Line Store by Falk's company, Falsoft, which was based in Prospect, Kentucky. History The first issue of the magazine was two double-sided sheets containing text printed on a Radio Shack Line Printer VII printer. Falk photocopied 25 of the debut issue, and sold them for $1.00. After the first batch sold out, he made ten more copies. The magazine's \\"...articles, comments, tips, and program listings...\\" CoCo Chronicles section about The Rainbow were good enough to attract advertisements from The Micro Works and JARB Software by the release of the third issue. JARB Software (and Joe Bennett in particular) became a contributor of many software and hardware articles in early issues of The Rainbow. Beginning with the first anniversary issue, the magazine was professionally typeset and had full color covers. The December 1982 issue was the first to use perfect binding. The magazine operations moved into a commercial space in early 1983 after having started in an extra room in Falk's home, then to this home's renovated basement. In 1983, The Rainbow started a series of CoCo conventions under the name Rainbowfest. Lonnie Falk was elected mayor of Prospect in November 1993 and was continued in office until his death in June 2006 at age 63 of a heart attack. Content The magazine featured articles, columns, reviews, tutorials, letters from readers, and advertisements. Many articles presented BASIC or assembly language program listings. Readers had to type these programs in by hand, unless they ordered a cassette or diskette containing these programs, through the Rainbow on Tape or Rainbow on Disk service. The BASIC programs were printed in a fixed font with 32 characters per line so that they would show up just as they did on the CoCo's standard 32√ó16 text screen. The magazine provided a small program called Rainbow Check Plus which helped users type in the listings accurately. The program would count the number and values of characters which the user typed in. A small box accompanying a program listing would serve as a checksum system. It was a two-column table that specified what checksum value was expected for a few chosen lines in the program. For example, after line 140, the checksum was expected to be 149, then after line 290, it was expected to be 21, etc. This system required the user to type the listing exactly as it appeared, including all spaces and possible typographical errors. Some users preferred to edit and improve the program as they typed it, at the risk of making hard-to-find mistakes. The publication's style was informal. It was mostly geared towards beginners and hobbyists. Articles were often accompanied by colorful illustrations, and so was each month's cover. There was also a comic strip whose main character was called the CoCo Cat. Lonnie Falk wrote a monthly editorial titled PRINT#-2, (with a comma at the end of the title, because it was part of the syntax of the CoCo BASIC's PRINT command when targeting the printer). The advertisements came from some large companies like Tandy but mostly from small software and hardware vendors. While Tandy would have full-page color ads, the small vendors' ads would be smaller and much more modest in style. This reflected the fact that it was relatively easier at the time to start a business in the computer field. The barrier to entry in today's computer industry is arguably higher. Software and hardware reviews appeared in each issue. The Rainbow Certification Seal was attributed to a product to certify that it had been seen by the Rainbow staff and that it did exist. It was not however a guarantee of satisfaction since it did not say anything about the quality of the product. The reviews were supposed to fill that role. The certification program started in The Rainbow's second year. The magazine had a department called the Rainbow Scorecard which registered high scores achieved by readers playing CoCo video games. Each issue of the magazine had a theme that was typically associated with the calendar month. The December issue was the Holiday issue, while the January issue was the Beginners issue and was meant as an introduction to the CoCo world for readers who had received a Color Computer for Christmas. August was the Games issue, September was Education, November was Telecommunications, and July was the Anniversary issue.

Typically, these events are intended for attendance by the general public. Attendees can sample Greek music, cuisine, and dance, typically performed in traditional dress. Such events are often fundraisers for Orthodox churches of the Greek Archdiocese. These Greek festivals originate from celebrations in Greece for religious holidays, such as, Greek Orthodox Easter and non- religious holidays, such as, the Festival of Flowers (Protomayia). Greek foods often served at Greek festivals include Lamb, Greek salad with olives and Feta cheese, Dolmades, Spanakopita, Tiropita, and Greek Coffee. Sweets include Baklava, Loukoumades, Diples, Galaktoboureko, Koulorakia, and Kourabiedes. In a modern context, the term \\"Greek Fest\\" is also used to refer to the celebrations or festivities organized and held by college/university fraternities and sororities (Greek system organizations) in North America.

A male line descendant of the medieval Amhara kings, and thus a member of the House of Solomon, he was the son of Emperor Na'od and Empress Na'od Mogesa. The important victory over the Adal sultan Mahfuz may have given Dawit the appellation Wanag Segad, which is a combination of Ge Ωez and Harari terms.  Biography  = Early reign = In contrast to previous emperors, Dawit had only one wife, Seble Wongel, whom he married around 1512‚Äì13. The couple had eight children: four sons and four daughters. Taking only one wife throughout his life was seen as a Christian act that fit with the ideals of the Church. Although she was well into her seventies, the Empress Mother Eleni stepped in to act as her step-great- grandson's regent until 1516, when he came of age. During this time, she was aware that the neighboring Muslim states were benefitting from the assistance of other, larger Muslim countries like the Ottoman Empire. Eleni sought to neutralize this advantage by dispatching the Ethiopian Armenian Mateus to Portugal to ask for assistance. However, the Portuguese response did not arrive in Ethiopia until much later, when an embassy led by Dom Rodrigo de Lima arrived at Massawa on 9 April 1520. Traversing the Ethiopian highlands, they did not reach Dawit's camp until 19 October of that year. Francisco √Ålvares provides us a description of the Emperor: Dawit had ambushed and killed Emir Mahfuz of Adal in 1517. About the same time a Portuguese fleet attacked Zeila, a Muslim stronghold, and burned it. In 1523, Dawit campaigned amongst the Gurage near Lake Zway. Contemporaries concluded that the Muslim threat to Ethiopia was finally over, so when the diplomatic mission from Portugal arrived at last, Dawit denied that Mateus had the authority to negotiate treaties, ignoring Eleni's counsels. After a stay of six years, the Portuguese at last set sail and left a governing class who thought they were securely in control of the situation. As Paul B. Henze notes, \\"They were mistaken.\\"Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 85. = Ethiopian‚ÄìAdal war = With the death of Sultan Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad in 1520, a young general and imam, Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al- Ghazi, known as \\"the Imam\\", consolidated his hold on the Adal Sultanate, making his candidate Umar Din sultan, then began a campaign to extinguish the Ethiopian Empire. The Imam crossed the Awash River and entered Fatagar in 1528, looting and burning the town of Badeqe before Dawit could arrive with his army. He began to withdraw, retreating across the Samara, a tributary of the Awash. The Imam's followers were accustomed to making lightning raids on Ethiopian territory, swiftly attacking and quickly returning home; they had no experience in pitched battles, and Imam Ahmad Gragn struggled with numerous desertions.As described by Sihab ad-Din Ahmad bin 'Abd al-Qader, Futuh al- Habasa: The conquest of Ethiopia, translated by Paul Lester Stenhouse with annotations by Richard Pankhurst (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), pp. 68‚Äì70. The Emperor Dawit caught up with Imam Ahmad Gragn's forces, and they engaged in battle on either 7 or 9 March 1529, at the Battle of Shimbra Kure, but failed to destroy the Imam's army. While not a clear victory for the Imam, this battle still proved to the Imam's followers that they could fight and defeat the Ethiopian army. Imam Ahmad Gragn spent the next two years preoccupied beyond the Awash, but returned to attack Ethiopia in 1531, where he scattered the army under the general Eslamu by firing the first cannon in the Horn of Africa. Dawit was forced to withdraw into the Ethiopian highlands and fortify the passes into Bet Amhara (\\"the House of Amhara\\"), leaving the territories to the east and south under the protection of his general Wasan Sagad. However, Wasan Sagad was slain near Mount Busat while fighting Ura'i Utman on 29 July (5 Nahase 1524 A.M.) and his army scattered. The Imam surprised the Emperor at the Battle of Amba Sel on 27 October, where the Emperor was almost captured, a reversal, in the words of R.S. Whiteway, that left Lebna Dengel \\"never in a position to offer a pitched battle to his enemies.\\"R.S. Whiteway, The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1541‚Äì1543, 1902 (Nendeln, Liechtenstein: Kraus Reprint Limited, 1967), p. xxxvi. The Imam's followers poured into Bet Amhara, pillaging every church they found, including Mekane Selassie, Atronsa Maryam, Debre Nagwadgwad and Ganata Giyorgis. Emperor Dawit fell back behind the Abay River to the relative security of Gojjam. Only their failure to capture the royal compound at Amba Geshen slowed the Muslims down. In the campaigns that followed, Ahmad's followers destroyed churches, monasteries, and converted Christians at the point of spear. In April 1533, Ahmad once again assembled his troops at Debre Berhan to conquer‚Äîor at least ravage‚Äîthe northern regions of Tigray, Begemder, and Gojjam. Both Ethiopia and Dawit suffered heavily from these assaults. The monastery of Debre Libanos was burned,Futuh, pp. 186‚Äì193. and the establishments on the islands of Lake Tana looted.Futuh, pp. 381‚Äì384. Dawit's eldest son Fiqtor was killed at Zara in Wag by a lieutenant of Ahmad on 7 April 1537; another son, Menas, was captured on 19 May 1539, and later sent to Yemen. Amba Geshen fell to another assault in January 1540, the royal prisoners interred there were slaughtered with their guards and the royal treasury looted. = Later life = Late-16th century portrait During the years that he lived as an outlaw in his own realm, Dawit came to see Queen Eleni's wisdom in reaching out to Europe for help, and he dispatched Jo√£o Bermudes, who had arrived in Ethiopia with Dom Rodrigo de Lima, to ask for it once again. However, this help in the form of Crist√≥v√£o da Gama and his picked troop of 400 did not reach Ethiopia until after Dawit died in the mountain-top monastery Debre Damo on 2 September 1540. The Ethiopian historian Taddesse Tamrat writes, \\"The Muslim occupation of the Christian highlands under Ahmad Gragn lasted for little more than ten years, between 1531 and 1543. But the amount of destruction brought about in these years can only be estimated in terms of centuries.\\"Taddesse Tamrat, Church and State in Ethiopia (1270‚Äì1527) (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 301. Dawit was succeeded by his son Gelawdewos, as his son Menas had been captured by Ahmad a year before Dawit died. His release wasn't secured until 1543, when Queen Seble Wongel exchanged him for the captured son of Bati del Wambara and Ahmed after the Battle of Wayna Daga. One of Dawit II's younger sons, Yaqob, is said to have stayed behind to hide in the province of Menz in Shewa. Yaqob's grandson Susenyos I defeated his various second cousins in 1604 to become Emperor and started the Gondar line of the Solomonic dynasty. Another grandson started the Shewan line of the Solomonic dynasty.

It is located east northeast of Perth and east of Kalgoorlie in Western Australia, on the Nullarbor Plain. Zanthus accident - showing 'Indian Pacific' passenger train and derailed carriages Incident On 18 August 1999 an eastbound freight train was waiting at the departure end of the crossing loop for the westbound Indian Pacific passenger train to pass through. The second engineman was waiting at the control panel for the points for the opposing train to pass through. Out of habit he had the control panel box unlocked and opened. Unfortunately, out of habit, he pressed the button to operate the points at an inappropriate time, and the opposing train was diverted at a speed of about into the loop where it could not stop in time to avoid a head-on collision. The actual speed of impact as recorded by the locomotive data logger on NR 15 was 27 km/h. Injuries and damage Twenty-one passengers and crew from the Indian Pacific were airlifted by the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Kalgoorlie Hospital from the remote Coonana airstrip, from the crash site. Only two passengers were admitted for overnight observations. Westrail provided two Prospector railcars to transfer the remainder of the passengers back to Kalgoorlie. All nineteen coaches of the Indian Pacific received varying degrees of damage, from minor internal damage to the write-off of luggage/smoking car HM311; some abandoned wrecked carriages are still at the site. At the time, Great Southern Rail estimated the damage to the coaches to be of the value of $5 million. National Rail Corporation estimated the damage to locomotives NR15 and NR51 at around $1 million. Aftermath Since the accident, the operation of the points at this and other crossing loops has been altered so that the point indicator lights will not operate until the access process is completed, and this gives all trains time to stop at the red point indicator lights. The simplified overview of process is: #access box - 120-180 second delay all line points are/changed to red #door opens #60-90 second delay until point control inputs are accepted, points can then be changed. #close door/seal box, lights are changed to indicate point positions. All traffic then proceeds as directed. This accident happened because the points were not fully interlocked, and were merely a kind of power-assisted hand lever, with automatic normalisation.

Prior to its construction, the female prisoners were at Fremantle Prison, which was overcrowded and offered women limited opportunities. Bandyup Women's Prison holds sentenced and remand prisoners of all security classifications. It is run as a maximum security prison though only 10% of the women are categorised as maximum security. It is the only prison for women on remand or sentenced in the Perth metropolitan area. The prison is inspected every three years by the state Office for the Inspector of Custodial Services.http://www.oics.wa.gov.au/wp- content/uploads/2014/12/93-Bandyup.pdf  History  Women prisoners in Western Australia were housed at Fremantle Gaol until a Women's Rehabilitation Centre was opened in 1969. Bandyup Training Centre, the precursor to Bandyup Women's Prison, was opened in 1971. It was originally built to hold 68 women. In 1998, following civil society agitation, an urgency motion and debate was held in state parliament about the conditions at Bandyup. The prison was so overcrowded that women were sleeping on mattresses on the floor. A major refurbishment of the prison with the addition of new units, completed in 2003, brought the total design capacity to 180. Not long after, however, overcrowding again became an issue and continues to this day.  Overcrowding  Women are still sleeping on mattresses on the floor in 2019. Despite the Minister for Corrective Services assuring this was not the case in Parliament on 19 February, the prison will continue this practice while there is no cap on the number of women that can be held there. In early 2015, the Department of Corrective Services stopped using the phrase \\"operational capacity\\" and starting using the phrase \\"total capacity\\", which includes beds that have been added to the design capacity on an ad hoc basis. The total capacity published on the DCS website on 23 January 2015 was 321, though the total population at Bandyup on any one day is consistently higher than this. Bunk beds have been installed in various units and are planned to be installed in most cells of the prison, including cells designed for single occupancy. The beds added in unit 4 are so close to the ceiling that the occupant is not able to sit upright in bed and a ceiling light is about 10 cm away from the head of the bed. As there is no desk or chair in these units, these occupants are not able to sit down in the cell. The increase in beds comes without a corresponding increase in other infrastructure, such as showering facilities, or services, such as nursing services or access to phones. While waiting for bunk beds, women have been sleeping on plastic-covered mattresses on the floor. In units 1 and 2, women that sleep on the floor have their head next to the toilet. These units are mostly occupied by Aboriginal women. In 2016 Melaleuca Remand and Reintegration Facility was opened, which is intended to reduce the pressure on Bandyup.

His throne name was A·π£n√§f S√§g√§d I (, modern , \\"to whom the horizon bows\\" or \\"the remotest regions submit [to him]\\"). He was a younger son of Dawit II by Seble Wongel.Remedius Prutky states that Gelawdewos had a son, Na'od; this son is not mentioned in his Royal Chronicle. J. H. Arrowsmith-Brown, translator and editor, Prutky's Travels to Ethiopia and Other Countries (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991), p. 112 and note.  Reign  His reign was dominated by the struggle with Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi during the Abyssinian‚ÄìAdal war until Ahmad's defeat and death in the Battle of Wayna Daga on February 21, 1543. Gelawdewos devoted time and energy to rallying his people against Ahmad, a determination his chronicler credits prevented Ahmad's forcible conversions from being permanent. With Ahmad's death, Gelawdewos was not only able to eject the leaderless Muslim forces from the Ethiopian Highlands, but also from the lowlands to the east, which included the Sultanate of Dawaro and Bale.Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopian Borderlands (Trenton: Red Sea Press, 1997), pp. 241f. He also turned his attention to the numerous Ethiopians who had crossed over to the Imam's side, either to further themselves or out of self-preservation. While some presented themselves to Gelawdewos expecting to be pardoned only to be executed, to many others he granted his safe conduct, according to Miguel de Castanhoso, \\"for there were so many [who had joined Imam Ahmad] that had he ordered all to be killed, he would have remained alone.\\"R.S. Whiteway, editor and translator, The Portuguese Expedition to Abyssinia in 1441-1543, 1902. (Nendeln, Liechtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1967), p. 86 = Campaigns = In early 1548, Gelawdewos led his army in campaign in the western fringes of the Empire, perhaps in Bizamo, beyond the province of Damot, which was then inhabited by pagans. The campaign lasted six months and ended in victory.Solomon Gebreyes Beyene, The Chronicle of King G√§lawdewos (1540-1559): A Critical Edition with Annotated Translation, p. 218, Chap. 33, https://d-nb.info/1116605163/34 Whilst Gelawdewos was campaigning in the west, Nur ibn Mujahid once again invaded. Gelawdewos's vassal Fanu'el succeeded in repulsing them. In 1550 Ras Fanu'el followed up with a further attack into Muslim territory, plundering the countryside for six months.He further pushed the campaign into Adal, destroying castles and capturing livestock.Solomon, The Chronicle, p. 220, Chap. 38 After this campaign in the east, a number of revolts were suppressed, in Gum√§r, and Gambo provinces. From 1556 to 1557, the Ottomans under Ozdemir Pasha attacked seized Massawa, Arqiqo and Dahlak. Gelawdewos relied on the resistance of the population. In the area of Bur, the farmers killed troops and a commander named Yeshaq, and sent the latter's head to the Emperor.Solomon, The Chronicle, p. 237, Chap. 66 In 1559, Nur ibn Mujahid invaded Fatagar with a force comprising 1800 horsemen and 500 riflemen, and numerous sword and bow-wielding troops.Solomon , The Chronicle, p. 246, Chap. 84 To face that threat, Gelawdewos ordered Ras Hamalmal of Kambata and Ras Fasil to lead two armies against Harar, which they successfully took.History of the Oromo - A·π£ma Giyorgis and his Work. History of the GƒÅllƒÅ and the Kingdom of ≈†awƒÅ. Edited and translated by Bairu Tafla. http://ethioobserver.net/Kambata2.htm Galawdewos then led his own troops, hastily assembled. On March 23, 1559, the imperial army met Nur ibn Mujahid force in battle at a place named Nech Sar,Solomon, The Chronicle, p. 248, Chap. 87 where, according to a Harari chronicle, Gelawdewos was killed in battle. \\"Early in the engagement Galawd√©wos was hit by a bullet, but continued to fight until surrounded by a score of Harari cavalry, who struck him fatally to the ground with their spears,\\" according to Pankhurst. Emir Nur had the Emperor's head sent to the country of Sa'ad ad-Din II, then rode off to plunder Ethiopian territory before returning home.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Borderlands, p. 246. The explorer Richard Francis Burton tells a slightly different account, adding that Gelawdewos had been supervising the restoration of Debre Werq when he received a message from Emir Nur challenging him to combat. When the Emperor met the Emir, a priest warned that the angel Gabriel had told him Gelawdewos would needlessly risk his life‚Äîwhich caused most of the Ethiopian army to flee.Richard Burton, First Footsteps in East Africa (New York: Praeger, 1966), pp. 183f According to G. W. B. Huntingford, Gelawdewos' body was buried at Tadbaba Maryam near Sayint and his head, which was brought back to Ethiopia by some traders, was buried in Ensaqya (now in Antsokiyana Gemza) in the Tomb of Saint Gelawdewos.George Wynn Brereton Huntingford, The historical geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704, (Oxford University Press: 1989), p. 135 = Foreign relations = The first problem of foreign relations Gelawdewos had to deal with following his victory at Wayna Daga was Jo√£o Bermudes, a Portuguese priest whom his father had sent abroad as his ambassador to secure help from Portugal. Bermudes had represented himself in Europe as the properly appointed Patriarch of Ethiopia (or Abuna), and once he returned to Ethiopia, he claimed he had been appointed by Pope Paul III as Patriarch of Alexandria. A surviving letter dated 13 March 1546 from John III of Portugal to Emperor Gelawdewos, translated by Whiteway, is a response to a lost letter wherein the Ethiopian ruler asked, in essence, \\"Who is this Jo√£o Bermudes fellow? And why does he behave so irresponsibly?\\" King John's answer was frank: According to Bermudes' own account of his time in Ethiopia, early in the reign of Gelawdewos he was banished to Gafat south of the Blue Nile (Amharic Abbay), the first of several exiles that ended when Bermudes left Ethiopia. This banishment probably followed Gelawdewos' receipt of King John's letter. In the same letter, King John promised to send priests more worthy than Bermudes, and during his reign two different groups of Jesuit missionaries arrived in Ethiopia. The first group arrived 7 February 1555 to determine the state of the country and whether the Ethiopians would properly receive a Patriarch anointed by the Catholic Church. Gelawdewos received them, but gave them no overt encouragement.Balthasar Tellez, The Travels of the Jesuits in Ethiopia, 1710 (LaVergue: Kessinger, 2010), pp. 133f The second group landed in March 1557, and was headed by Andr√©s de Oviedo, who had been made titular bishop of Nice. Gelawdewos received them just before leaving to campaign against Nur ibn Mujahid but did not make any promises.Tellez, Travels, pp. 137‚Äì140 In response to their arguments, Gelawdewos wrote his Confession, which defended the Miaphysitism of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. According to Richard Pankhurst, Gelawdewos' Confession helped his fellow Ethiopian Christians to remain \\"steadfast in their adherence to Sabbath observance, circumcision, and the prohibition against pork and other 'unclean' foods.\\"Richard Pankhurst, The Ethiopians: A History (Oxford: Blackwell, 2001), p. 95 Ethiopia's access to the outside world was severely crippled during his reign in 1557 when the Ottoman Empire conquered Massawa. From that point forward, dignitaries and missionaries to Ethiopia had to travel in disguise to avoid Muslim authorities. This also allowed the Ottomans to block the Ethiopians from importing firearms.  References  =Works cited= *  Further reading  * Richard K. P. Pankhurst. The Ethiopian Royal Chronicles.

The ship was the second of two identical ships built by the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company for the Eastern Steamship Lines for service on the New York ‚Äì Yarmouth, Nova Scotia route.The first and sister ship was named Yarmouth (keel laid February 23, 1926, launched November 6, 1926, delivered July 7, 1927, official number 226635) and should not be confused with Yarmouth Castle. The sister ship was renamed Queen of Nassau in 1954; Yarmouth Castle in 1957; Yarmouth again, in 1961; San Andred in 1966; Elizabeth A in 1967; and scrapped in 1977. In practice the ship operated out of both Boston and New York for the Canadian ports. Evangeline was turned over to the War Shipping Administration which operated all ocean going vessels for the United States during World War II. The ship was allocated to the Army which after a brief time under charter took over the ship as a United States Army Transport for troop transport. USAT Evangeline first supported build up of troops in the Caribbean and then supported operations in North Africa until being transferred to the Southwest Pacific in January 1944 until December 1945. The ship was permanently returned to Eastern Steamship Lines on July 1, 1946. The ship returned to commercial service in May 1947 but did not meet all fire safety standards and was laid up from 1948 to 1953 with a brief time operating in 1950. Evangeline was sold and put under Liberian registry. In 1963 Evangeline was again sold, put under Panamanian registry and renamed Yarmouth Castle. The ship's operators faced financial difficulties and operated the ship between Miami and Nassau, Bahamas until the disaster on November 12, 1965.  Construction and early service Evangeline was built for a new service between New York ‚Äì Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. The ship was laid down at William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia as hull number 524 on May 1, 1926. On February 12, 1927 the ship was launched and christened Evangeline with completion in September and delivery on October 4, 1927. The ship was a twin screw, steam turbine driven vessel of , on waterline, registered length, beam and depth with a crew of 141. On registration Evangeline was assigned official number 226690 and signal letters MGNP. Evangeline had five decks, the upper three devoted to passengers with one cargo deck specially designed for automobiles. The ship had a glassed in promenade deck, two social halls, library, dancing saloon and a verandah cafe. Six boilers provided steam to two Parsons turbines developing 7,500 shaft horsepower for a speed of . In actual operation Evangeline served on both the Boston and New York routes with seasonal variation. World War II troop transport On January 6, 1942 Evangeline was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) at New Orleans for wartime service. The ship had been evaluated for use as an Army hospital ship, considered better than several actually converted, but was never converted nor used as a hospital ship. The ship was allocated to Army transportation requirements and operated by Alooa Steamship Company under an Army Transportation Corps time charter agreement until placed under a general WSA agreement with Eastern Steamship on March 25. On August 1, 1942 the ship was delivered at Norfolk, Virginia for operation under bareboat charter by the War Department (Army) for operation as a United States Army Transport. The transport operated during the first half of 1942 out of New Orleans to Cura√ßao, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Trinidad, Jamaica, Haiti, and Panama. After repair and conversion in Galveston, Texas during September and October 1942 Evangeline began operations out of New York in November to Oran, Casablanca, Algiers, Bizerte, and other North African ports supporting operations after the landings in North Africa on November 8, 1942. The transport made one trip to the United Kingdom after return to New York in August 1943 and in January 1944 departed for service in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) for operations. Evangeline called at Bora Bora, Milne Bay and Noumea before a voyage repair period in Honolulu and then extensive repairs at San Francisco from April to June 1944. The ship went from San Francisco to Seattle from which the ship returned to SWPA and Espiritu Santo, Milne Bay, Oro Bay, Finschhafen, Townsville, and Brisbane. The Army assigned Evangeline the local fleet number X-18 for those operations and shown as part of the SWPA fleet until July, 1945. The ship returned to Honolulu December 25, 1944 and to San Francisco in January, 1945 where Navy took over jurisdiction briefly until April. On April 20, 1945 Evangeline was again under Army and returned to SWPA until returning to Los Angeles in December, 1945. In January, 1946, Evangeline sailed in ballast to arrive at Boston on February 7, 1946 for delivery to WSA for disposition. On February 19, 1946 the ship was returned to Eastern Steamship Lines for operation under WSA agreement until permanent return on July 1, 1946. Post war commercial service After being refitted and refinished at the Bethlehem Steel Corporation's shipyards at a cost of US$1.5 million, she returned to passenger service in May 1947. Fire safety was considered during the refit. Since an upgrade of the ship to the then-current construction standards was not viable, the United States Coast Guard allowed the wooden construction to remain but mandated several improvements, including the installation of a ship-wide sprinkler system. She operated on the New York City ‚Äì Bahamas run for less than a year, and was then laid up from 1948 to 1953, save for a two-month period in 1950. The ship was sold to a Liberian company called the Volusia Steamship Company in 1954. She was given an overnight run from Boston to Nova Scotia, and resumed service to the Caribbean in 1955. The ship was sold in 1963 to the Chadade Steamship Company, and her name was changed to Yarmouth Castle that year. She offered service from New York City to the Bahamas for Caribbean Cruise Lines, which went bankrupt that same year. By the end of 1964, Yarmouth Castle was operated by Yarmouth Cruise Lines. The ship ran pleasure cruises on the 186-mile stretch between Miami and Nassau. She was under Panamanian registry.  Fire  Yarmouth Castle departed Miami for Nassau on November 12, 1965, with 376 passengers and 176 crewmen aboard, a total of 552 people. The ship was due to arrive in Nassau the next day. The captain on the voyage was 35-year-old Byron Voutsinas. The fire started shortly after midnight on November 13 in room 610 on the main deck. At the time of the fire, the room was being used as a storage space and contained mattresses, chairs and other combustible materials. No sprinkler head was installed in the room. The source of the fire could not be determined; it may have been caused by jury-rigged wiring, sparks entering through the ventilation or by carelessness. A watchman did a security patrol between 0:30 and 0:50 a.m. but failed to systematically check all areas of the ship and detect the fire. At some point between midnight and 1:00 a.m. crew and passengers began noticing smoke and heat and started searching for a fire. When they discovered it in room 610 and the toilet above, it had already begun to spread and attempts to fight the fire with fire extinguishers were not effective. Attempts to activate a fire alarm box were also unsuccessful. The bridge was unaware of the fire until about 1:10 a.m. By this point, Yarmouth Castle was 120 miles east of Miami and 60 miles northwest of Nassau. At 1:00 a.m. the engine room alerted the bridge that smoke was coming through the ventilation system. The captain was summoned to the bridge, instructed the crew to sound the alarm, and departed to locate the fire. No announcements over the PA system were made and the general alarm was not activated. The general alarm would have sounded alarm bells throughout the ship, alerted the passengers, and summoned off-duty personnel to the emergency stations. After about five minutes, the captain returned to the bridge and at 1:20 a.m. ordered the ship stopped. The radio officer could not send a distress call because of flames and smoke in the radio room. The fire forced the crew to leave the bridge, and the captain gave order to abandon ship at about 1:25 a.m. At this point the general alarm could no longer be sounded and they were unable to issue the complete \\"abandon ship\\" signal using the ship's whistle. The captain proceeded to the lifeboat containing the emergency radio, but could not reach it. He and several crewmen launched another lifeboat and abandoned ship at about 1:45 a.m. The captain later testified that he wanted to reach one of the rescue vessels to make an emergency call. Photograph of the fire taken from the boat deck of Bahama Star The remaining crew proceeded to alert passengers and attempted to help them escape their cabins. Some passengers tried to escape through cabin windows but found them difficult or impossible to open due to improper maintenance. The sprinkler system activated but was largely ineffective due to the severity of the fire. Crewmen attempted to battle the flames with hoses, but were hampered by low hydrant pressure. The investigation later determined that more valves were open than the pumps could handle. While some lifeboats burned and others could not be launched due to mechanical problems, half of the ship's boats made it safely away. Passengers near the bow could not reach the lifeboats and were later picked up by boats from rescue vessels. The Finnish freighter Finnpulp was just eight miles ahead of Yarmouth Castle, also headed east. At 1:30 a.m., the ship's mate noticed that Yarmouth Castle had slowed significantly on the radar screen. Looking astern, he saw the glowing flames and notified the captain, John Lehto, who had been asleep. Lehto immediately ordered Finnpulp turned around. The freighter radioed Nassau three times but got no reply. At 1:36 a.m., the Finnpulp successfully contacted the Coast Guard in Miami. It was the first distress call sent out. The passenger liner Bahama Star was following Yarmouth Castle at about twelve miles distance. At 2:15 a.m., Captain Carl Brown noticed rising smoke and a red glow on the water. Realizing that this was Yarmouth Castle, he ordered the ship ahead at full speed. Bahama Star radioed the U.S. Coast Guard at 2:20 a.m. The first ship on the scene was the freighter Finnpulp, aiding the first lifeboat, which carried the Yarmouth Castle's captain. After picking up the passengers and some crew from that boat, the freighter turned to rescue further passengers from the burning ship. Finnpulp also launched its own boats to rescue passengers. By this time, Bahama Star had arrived on the scene. The ship stopped 100 yards from Yarmouth Castle and launched lifeboats, which lined up against the starboard side of the burning ship. Some people jumped into the water and climbed aboard the lifeboats. Others descended ropes and rope ladders. Finnpulp lowered a motorboat, which towed some of the boats to Bahama Star. Starting about 2:30 a.m. the U.S. Coast Guard began sending planes and later helicopters to assist in the rescue. The airborne operations would continue throughout the following day. All survivors had been pulled aboard Finnpulp and Bahama Star by 4:00 a.m. Just before 6:00 a.m., Yarmouth Castle rolled over onto her port side and sank at 6:03 a.m.  Aftermath  Fourteen critically injured people were taken by helicopter from Bahama Star to Nassau hospitals. Bahama Star rescued 240 passengers and 133 crewmen. Finnpulp rescued 51 passengers and 41 crewmen. Both ships arrived in Nassau on November 13. Eighty-seven people went down with the ship, and three of the rescued passengers later died at hospitals, bringing the final death toll to 90. Of the dead, only two were crewmembers: stewardess Phyllis Hall and Dr. Lisardo Diaz-Toorens, the ship's physician. While some bodies were recovered, most were lost with the ship. The Yarmouth Castle fire was the worst disaster in North American waters since the Noronic burned and sank in Toronto Harbour with the loss of up to 139 lives in 1949.  Investigation  An investigation into the sinking was launched by the U.S. Coast Guard, which issued a 27-page report on the disaster in March 1966. The board of inquiry found that the proximate cause of the disaster was the failure to detect the fire early on. Contributing to this were the inadequate security patrol and the lack of a sprinkler head in room 610. The construction of the ship, which contained excessive flammable material, allowed the fire to quickly spread out of control. The high death toll was attributed to the fact the general alarm and PA system were not immediately used to alert passengers and crew. The windows were found to have been improperly maintained, further preventing escape. The report blames the captain and officers on the scene for not taking \\"firm and positive\\" action to organize firefighting and evacuation of passengers. It describes the captain's abandonment of the ship as \\"negligent\\" and an \\"overall failure to approach and cope with the difficulties.\\" The board noted that while the ship's firefighting procedures were adequate, they were not properly implemented by the crew. The report determined that Yarmouth Castle sank because the doors between the watertight compartments had not been sealed, allowing water to flow freely from the firefighting and sprinkler systems. This caused Yarmouth Castle to list and allowed more water to enter through open bulkheads. Yarmouth Castle had passed a safety check and fire drill three weeks before the sinking. Although it did not need to conform to American safety regulations since it was registered under the Panamanian flag, it had to conform to the Safety of Life at Sea or SOLAS, and was regularly inspected by the U.S. Coast Guard. The Yarmouth Castle disaster prompted updates to the Safety of Life at Sea law, or SOLAS. The updated law brought new maritime safety rules, requiring fire drills, safety inspections, and structural changes to new ships. Under SOLAS, any vessel carrying more than 50 overnight passengers is required to be built entirely of non-combustible materials such as steel. Yarmouth Castle's largely wooden superstructure was found to be the main cause of the fire's rapid spread.  Legacy  Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot wrote a song based on the tragedy. Called \\"Ballad of Yarmouth Castle,\\" it was released on his fifth United Artists album, Sunday Concert, in 1969. That album, along with Lightfoot's other UA releases, was re-released in a three-CD compilation, The Original Lightfoot: The United Artists Years, in 1992. The ballad was not Lightfoot's only shipwreck-themed song; in 1976, he released his album Summertime Dream, which included the song \\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald,\\" based on the sinking of the American-flagged Great Lakes freighter Edmund Fitzgerald in an early November gale in 1975. The Evangeline appears in the 1962 James Bond movie, \\"Dr. No\\" It can be seen in the background during a scene where Bond meets Quarrel at the Nassau boat docks.

Statements In modern discourse, the paradox was articulated by John M. Dutton and William H. Starbuck \\"As a model of a complex system becomes more complete, it becomes less understandable. Alternatively, as a model grows more realistic, it also becomes just as difficult to understand as the real-world processes it represents\\". This paradox may be used by researchers to explain why complete models of the human brain and thinking processes have not been created and will undoubtedly remain difficult for years to come. This same paradox was observed earlier from a quote by philosopher-poet Paul Val√©ry, \\"Ce qui est simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l‚Äôest pas est inutilisable\\". (\\"A simple statement is bound to be untrue. One that is not simple cannot be utilized.\\") Also, the same topic has been discussed by Richard Levins in his classic essay \\"The Strategy of Model Building in Population Biology\\", in stating that complex models have 'too many parameters to measure, leading to analytically insoluble equations that would exceed the capacity of our computers, but the results would have no meaning for us even if they could be solved. (See Orzack and Sober, 1993; Odenbaugh, 2006) Related issues Bonini's paradox can be seen as a case of the map‚Äìterritory relation: simpler maps are less accurate though more useful representations of the territory. An extreme form is given in the fictional stories Sylvie and Bruno Concluded and \\"On Exactitude in Science\\", which imagine a map of a scale of 1:1 (the same size as the territory), which is precise but unusable, illustrating one extreme of Bonini's paradox. Isaac Asimov's fictional science of \\"Psychohistory\\" in his Foundation series also faces with this dilemma; Asimov even had one of his psychohistorians discuss the paradox.

Winner of eight consecutive gold medals (1990‚Äì2011) in international barbershop chorus competitions, the group possesses a diverse repertoire encompassing not only barbershop music but also classical, jazz, patriotic, sacred, standards and Broadway pops, and sings for various groups and organizations throughout the greater Los Angeles, California metropolitan area. The chorus won another barbershop international competition in 2017, bringing their total gold medal count to nine. History The Masters of Harmony began in the mid-1980s when a small group of barbershop singers from the Pasadena, California Chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society (SPEBSQSA, Inc.) decided to break away and start a new chapter \\"dedicated to musical excellence,\\" a phrase that became its slogan. The group obtained a chapter license in the spring of 1985 and then its charter at the Far Western District barbershop singing convention in October 1985. The chapter's original name, Foothill Cities, was derived from the series of towns that ran along the southern base of the San Gabriel Mountains, an area where most of the organizers then lived. In 1987 the chapter relocated its rehearsals to the Town Center in the City of Santa Fe Springs, California, and in 1998 changed its official name to that of the Santa Fe Springs Chapter. This relationship ended in 2019 and the chapter has now changed its official name to the Greater Los Angeles Chapter. Over the course of its existence, the chorus has been led by four primary music directors: Dr. Greg Lyne (1987‚Äì1996), Jeff Oxley (1998‚Äì1999), Mark Hale (2000‚Äì2012), and Justin Miller (2012‚Äì2019). The chorus is currently in the process of searching for their next permanent musical director. Contest successes Under the directorship of Dr. Lyne, in October 1988 the Masters of Harmony won the Far Western District chorus contest, thus qualifying for the Society-wide annual competition the following year. In July 1989 the chorus placed fourth at the international contest held in Kansas City, Missouri. The next year, in July 1990 in San Francisco, the chorus won the international chorus championship in a dramatic tiebreaker against the Louisville Thoroughbreds. In July 1993, when the chorus was next eligible to compete, it again won the international championship, this time in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Three years later, in July 1996 in Salt Lake City, Utah, the chorus achieved its third international chorus championship. At the 1999 international competition in Anaheim, California, the Masters of Harmony, now directed by Jeff Oxley, won its fourth consecutive chorus championship. On April 1, 2000, Mark Hale was appointed the new music director and led the chorus to four more consecutive victories: 2002 (Portland, Oregon), 2005 (Salt Lake City, Utah), 2008 (Nashville, Tennessee), and 2011 (Kansas City, Missouri). In early 2012, Hale announced that he would retire as director following the chorus‚Äôs performances as reigning champion at the July 2012 international convention in Portland, Oregon, and in August of that year Justin Miller was appointed the new director of the Masters of Harmony. The chorus next competed at the July 2014 International Chorus Contest in Las Vegas, Nevada, finishing in second place under the direction of Justin Miller. The silver-medal performance scored 2854 out of a possible 3000 points (95.1%) and ranks among the best in the history of the chorus. At the July 2016 International Chorus Contest in Nashville, Tennessee, the chorus earned third- place under the direction of Justin Miller. The bronze-medal performance scored 2783 out of a possible 3000 points (94.0%). The following year in Las Vegas, the chorus earned first place with a score of 2893 (96.4%), only 8 points more than their closest competitor. Quartet successes On three occasions, quartets consisting of four active chorus members of the Masters of Harmony won the International Quartet Championship: Nightlife (1996), OC Times (2008), and Masterpiece (2013). Three other International Champion Quartets won while some of their members were also active with the chorus: Revival (1998), Michigan Jake (2001), and Gotcha! (2004). On two occasions the International College Quartet Championship was won by quartets consisting of young men who were all active members of the Masters of Harmony: The Vagrants (2009) and The Newfangled Four (2013), and many other chorus members have sung in quartets which have won District championships Community outreach Since 2001, the Masters of Harmony have organized and sponsored an annual \\"Young Men's Harmony Festival\\" that brings together nearly 200 young men from high schools throughout Southern California for a day-long clinic and rehearsal, followed by an evening performance for the public. This program has been endorsed by the Southern California Vocal Association (SCVA), a professional organization of choral music teachers that serves the Southern California area. Mark Freedkin has been the driving force for this activity since 1995. As a result of his efforts, the SCVA created the new position of \\"VP of Barbershop Harmony Festivals\\" and named Freedkin to serve in that role.

Leopold von Hoesch (10 June 1881 ‚Äì 10 April 1936) was a career German diplomat. Hoesch began his political career in France as the charg√© d'affaires in 1923. Following the recall of the German Ambassador in 1923 after the Ruhr crisis, Hoesch was appointed acting head of the German Embassy in Paris. While in Paris, Hoesch worked closely with Gustav Stresemann, then foreign minister of Germany. Hoesch played an important role in the Locarno Treaty of 1924. Leopold von Hoesch (on left), 1932 In November 1932, Hoesch was transferred to the United Kingdom, where he would stay until his death in 1936. Hoesch was well liked by most British statesmen, including Anthony Eden and Sir John Simon. His reputation among the British as a knowledgeable and able-minded statesman helped to enhance the Anglo-German relationship during the early 1930s. With the Nazi takeover in 1933, little changed at first between Germany and the United Kingdom politically. However, by 1934, Hoesch was beginning to challenge Hitler indirectly, sending communiqu√©s to Konstantin Neurath, Foreign Minister of Germany, detailing Hoesch's distrust of Joachim von Ribbentrop whom Hitler had appointed to serve as Commissioner of Disarmament Questions. The relationship between Hoesch and Hitler continued to sour as Ribbentrop gained more power within the German government. By 1936, Hoesch was quickly becoming a thorn in Hitler's side. When Hitler occupied the Rhineland on 7 March 1936, Hoesch wrote to Konstantin Neurath denouncing the act as an action designed to provoke the French and ultimately the British. Less than one month later, at 10 am 11 April 1936, von Hoesch died of a heart attack while dressing in his bedroom at the German Embassy. Following his death, von Hoesch was honoured with a large British-ordered funeral cortege in which his flag-draped coffin was escorted to Dover, where a 19-gun salute was fired as his body was transferred to the British destroyer HMS Scout for transport back to Germany. His replacement was the notorious Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler's favourite foreign policy advisor, later to be hanged for war crimes.

The mountain was named Tronador (Spanish for \\"Thunderer\\") by locals in reference to the sound of falling seracs. With an altitude of , Tronador stands more than 1,000 m above nearby mountains in the Andean massif, making it a popular mountaineering destination. Located inside two national parks, Nahuel Huapi in Argentina and Vicente P√©rez Rosales in Chile, Tronador hosts a total of eight glaciers, which are currently retreating due to warming of the upper troposphere.Bown, Francisca. 2004.

Geography and geology Cerro Tronador is in the Wet Andes, a zone of high precipitation of both snow and rain. The humid temperate climate of the southern Andes has allowed several glaciers to develop due to high accumulation rates. Most of the precipitation is produced by western frontal systems from the Pacific. Located in the middle of the Andean massif at a latitude of 41¬∞ S, Tronador is part of an alpine landscape of fjords, glacial lakes, and U-shaped valleys. The forming of the landscape took place during the Quaternary glaciations, periods during which the whole area was covered by the Patagonian Ice Sheet. The volcano grew during the glacials and interglacials of the Pleistocene but became practically extinct in the late Middle Pleistocene, approximately 300 ka ago, due to a shift in the active front of the Southern Volcanic Zone to which it belongs.Mauricio Mella, Jorge Mu√±oz, Mario Vergara,Erik Klohn, Lang Farmer, Charles R. Stern Petrogenesis of the Pleistocene Tronador Volcanic Group, Andean Southern Volcanic Zone, Revista Geol√≥gica de Chile Since then, glaciations and other erosive processes shaped the mountain freely without new output of lava or tephra. As in the case of nearby Lan√≠n volcano, Tronador is composed mostly of basalts, and has seen a decline in activity as the Osorno and Calbuco volcanoes grow further west. =Glaciers= View of Casta√±o Overa Glacier View of Ventisquero Negro Tronador is notable for the many glaciers covering parts of its flanks. Up to eight glaciers have been inventoried: Alerce, Ventisquero Negro, Casa Pangue, Casta√±o Overa, R√≠o Blanco, Fr√≠as, Peulla, and Manso. Over the last decades the glaciers on Tronador, like the majority of southern Andean glaciers, have been retreating. The Casa Pangue glacier on the northwestern side of Tronador experienced a thinning between 1961 and 1998, with an increased rate of retreat between 1981‚Äì1998 at 52 m a‚àí1. The retreat and thinning is attributed to a decrease in precipitation and a warming of the upper troposphere over the last several decades. Alerce Glacier, on the Argentinian side, can be visited from Refugio Otto Meiling, a mountain hut that is sandwiched between it and Casta√±o Overa Glacier. Casta√±o Overa, also on the Argentinian side, is smaller and relatively accessible by hike from Pampa Linda. Guided trekking tours allow visitors to cross Casta√±o Overa or walk to Tronador's peak. Ventisquero Negro (\\"black snowdrift\\" in Spanish) is a rather unusual glacier at the base of Tronador in Nahuel Huapi National Park. Its unusual dark brown colour comes from dirt and sediment picked up in the glacier's accumulation zone, which is fed by the R√≠o Manso Glacier several hundred metres higher up the mountain. Brown icebergs calve from the glacier and then float in a small lake until eventually melting. = Peaks = According to the Aoneker map, these are the named peaks on Tronador: Anon or Internacional (3484m), Argentino (3187), Chileno (3262), and Torre Ilse (2585). Named ridges include Filo Sur (3054), Filo Blanco (3146), Filo La Vieja (2715), and Filo Lamotte (2340). Mountaineering and tourism Tronador was first climbed by Hermann Claussen solo on 29 January 1934, after several attempts. A mountain hut, Refugio Otto Meiling, is the destination of popular day hikes on the mountain, and is named after a German mountaineer who made dozens of ascents and spent years guiding people around it. The hut is located about 1200m vertically above Pampa Linda, at the mountain's base. Most summers the Internacional or Anon peaks (the highest of Tronador's three peaks) is climbable. However, an unusually hot summer increased rockfall to dangerous levels during January and February 2008. The Argentine side risks becoming no longer accessible due to increasingly warm weather in the region destabilising the glaciers.

It is the first computer from Apple to use the new PowerPC processor created by IBM and Motorola. The low-profile (\\"pizza-box\\") case was inherited from the Centris/Quadra 610 and 660AV models,\\"Power Macintosh 6100.\\" Apple-history.com /. N.p., n.d. Web. Nov 23, 2012. . and replaced the Macintosh Quadra series that used the Motorola 68040 processor, Apple's previous high-end workstation line. For the consumer market, the 6100 was re-branded as a Macintosh Performa with model numbers in the 6110 ‚Äì 6118 range denoting bundled software and hard drive sizes.\\"Power Macintosh 6100.\\" Low End Mac. N.p., n.d. Web. Nov 23, 2012. . An Apple Multiple Scan 15 Display and AppleDesign Keyboard were included as part of the package. For the server market, a variant was offered with additional server software, called the Apple Workgroup Server 6150. The 6100 was discontinued without a direct replacement. Overview The 6100 was introduced alongside the Power Macintosh 7100 and Power Macintosh 8100 and occupied the entry-level role of the new Power Macintosh family. MacWorlds review of the 6100/60 noted that \\"Not only has Apple finally regained the performance lead it lost about eight years ago when PCs appeared using Intel's 80386 CPU, but it has pushed far ahead.\\" Performance of 680x0 software is slower due to the need for System 7.5's new Mac 68k emulation layer, but MacWorlds benchmarks showed noticeably faster CPU, disk, video and floating point performance than the Quadra 610 it replaced. The 60 MHz models were upgraded to 66 MHz in January 1995. Apple also released a PC-compatible model of the 6100/66 called the Power Macintosh 6100 DOS Compatible. This version came with a PDS card with an Intel 80486 DX2/66 processor (without L2 cache) and a single SIMM RAM slot that uses the same type of RAM as in the 6100 itself. The card supports to 32 MiB of RAM, a Creative Technology Vibra 16 sound chipset, and also includes standard PC VGA and joystick ports. With this card, the 6100 is capable of running both the Mac OS interface and DOS/Windows 3.1 side-by-side, even on different monitors. The card could also use the main system RAM if there was no SIMM installed on the card. Notable were the new startup and \\"sad Mac\\" chimes: instead of the electronic \\"bong\\" that was the previous norm, it played a guitar chord strummed by jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan, and instead of the \\"Chimes of Doom\\" arpeggio that played when there was a hardware error at startup, there was the sound of a car crashing and glass breaking. This and the other NuBus-based Power Macintosh models (7100, 8100 and Workgroup Server 9150) were replaced by the Power Macintosh PCI series released in 1995, although the 6100 DOS compatible continued in production until 1996. By this time Apple had already released the anticipated \\"PC Personality Card\\" that plugged into one of the PCI slots of the newer Power Macs, featuring a 100 MHz Pentium processor. The 6100 was the slowest Power Macintosh in terms of processor speed upon introduction. Eventually, the 6100 series was able to be upgraded through third-party solutions such as Sonnet Technologies Crescendo G3 NuBus (up to 500 MHz) and G4 NuBus (up to 360 MHz; discontinued) and Newer Technology's MaxPower G3 processor upgrades. Early models had a CD eject button that would stick in. This was rectified on later models with a subtly re-profiled button moulding. Models The original Power Macintosh 6100 is based on the 60 MHz PowerPC 601 processor.\\"Power Macintosh 6100/60 (PC) Specs @ EveryMac.com.\\" EveryMac. N.p., n.d. Web. Nov 23, 2012. . The base model was complemented by an AV version, which included an add-on card fitted in its Processor Direct Slot that added audio and visual enhancements such as composite and S-video input/output and full 48 kHz 16-bit DAT-resolution sound processing. A double-speed CD-ROM is included as standard. A series of Performa models based on the 6100/60 were shipped in October 1994, collectively known as the \\"Performa 6100 series.\\" All Performas included an Apple Multiple Scan 15 Display, an AppleDesign Keyboard, and a suite of pre-installed software including Quicken, MacLinkPlus, American Heritage Dictionary, and Apple's eWorld online service.

It is best known for the picturesque Split Rock Lighthouse, one of the most photographed lighthouses in the United States. Built by the United States Lighthouse Service in 1910, the lighthouse and some adjacent buildings have been restored and the Minnesota Historical Society operates them as a museum. The state park offers a unique cart-in campground and scenic trails for hiking, cross-country skiing, and bicycling. Natural history =Geography= Split Rock Lighthouse State Park encompasses about of rocky shoreline on Lake Superior with several prominent headlands. Named features of the shore, from southwest to northeast, are the mouth of the Split Rock River, Split Rock Point, Crazy Bay, Corundum Point, the mouth of Split Rock Creek, Day Hill, Little Two Harbors, Stony Point (site of the lighthouse), and Gold Rock Point.State of Minnesota, Department of Natural Resources. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park. September 2009. The name Little Two Harbors comes from the division of the inlet by a small island, formerly a tombolo, and refers to the city of Two Harbors farther down the shore. There are two shallow sea caves at the base of Stony Point. The east and west branches of the Split Rock River, not to be confused with Split Rock Creek, join in the park. There are ten waterfalls on the river, although because they can only be reached by a moderate hike on the Superior Hiking Trail and are not marked on park maps, they are lightly visited. =Geology= Much of the shore of Lake Superior is made of basalt erupted from the Midcontinent Rift System when the middle of the North American Plate began to crack 1.1 billion years ago. In a small tract that includes Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, additional magma intruded into the basalt and cooled underground into a harder rock called diabase. These flows also carried with them blocks of anorthosite, an even harder rock from the base of the Earth's crust, which became interspersed randomly in the diabase. Three large blocks of anorthosite form Corundum Point, Day Hill, and Stony Point beneath the lighthouse. In the southwest portion of the park another eruption formed a layer of red rhyolite. The rhyolite has eroded into several natural pillars, and forms the walls of the Split Rock River gorge. Beginning 2 million years ago a series of glacial periods repeatedly covered the region with ice, scouring the bedrock and scooping out a great basin. The glaciers, and later meltwater, wore away less resistant rock, leaving behind hills and ridges of the harder diabase and anorthosite. At the end of the last glacial period the basin filled with meltwater. The water level fluctuated significantly over time due to blockages of the outlet and post-glacial rebound. The high-water Glacial Lake Duluth deposited clay sediments inland, while later, lower precursors of Lake Superior eroded bluffs and beach terraces. =Flora and fauna= Vegetation in the park The park was originally forested with red and white pine. However, these were heavily logged at the beginning of the 20th century, and wildfires sweeping through the cutover land killed many of the remaining saplings and seedlings. Today the vegetation is primarily birch with some spruce, fir, and ash trees. Mammals found in the park include white-tailed deer, moose, black bears, raccoons, snowshoe hares, red foxes, bobcats, and Canadian lynxes. A colony of beavers lives on the Split Rock River. Birds include herring gulls, common loons, and a variety of songbirds. Peregrine falcons nest on the lakeside cliffs. Cultural history =Early history= Several vestiges of early 20th-century industry are visible in the park. The first white settlement in the Split Rock area was Little Two Harbors, a commercial fishing village populated largely by Norwegian immigrants. The men of the village fished for trout, whitefish, and herring from 16‚Äì18 foot skiffs in the fall and winter. Little Two Harbors was inhabited until 1925, although in later years only 4 or 5 residents lived there year-round. Cement foundations of houses and fish processing buildings remain. A logging camp known as Splitrock existed at the mouth of the Split Rock River from 1899 to 1906. Pilings from their dam and wharf are still visible jutting from the water. The Merrill Logging Trail follows the route of their rail line. In 1901 a prospector from Duluth misidentified the outcrops of anorthosite as corundum, an extremely hard mineral valuable as an industrial abrasive. Three years later the North Shore Abrasives Company set up mining operations on Corundum Point, but abandoned the site in 1908 when their product was found to be inadequate. Their crushing house burned down in a forest fire in 1910 but its concrete footings remain. Another remnant from this period is a finely crafted, freestanding stone fireplace atop Day Hill. According to local legend it was the start of a house built around 1900 by Frank Day, a businessman from Duluth, for himself and his sweetheart, but abandoned when she did not reciprocate his love.Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park interpretive signage. =Split Rock Lighthouse= Three violent storms struck the Great Lakes in November 1905, killing 116 sailors. One, the Mataafa Storm of November 28, damaged nearly 30 ships on Lake Superior. Two ships were wrecked against the future park's shore, the steel steamboat William Edenborn and a barge it was towing, the Madeira. The Edenborn was beached far ashore at the mouth of the Split Rock River and later salvaged, but one of the 25 crewmembers was killed. The Madeira with 10 men aboard drifted northeast until violent waves began smashing her against the cliffs of Gold Rock Point. Crewman Fred Benson managed to leap onto the rocks and scale the cliff in the midst of the snowstorm. The first mate was swept overboard and drowned, but Benson was able to lower a rope and pull the other eight crew to safety. The Madeira sank in pieces at the foot of Gold Rock while the crewmen, suffering from exposure and frostbite, found shelter with local fishermen and loggers. Both crews were picked up two days later by the tugboat Edna G. Split Rock Lighthouse under construction in 1909 The shipping companies that had sustained losses in the storms lobbied the federal government for an expanded system of navigational aids on the Great Lakes. Besides the Edenborn and the Madeira, five other ships had been damaged within a dozen miles of the Split Rock River. A signal in that area was at the top of the industry's list of demands. The site ultimately selected for the lighthouse and fog signal was northeast of the Split Rock River, on Stony Point. There were no roads yet up the North Shore, so all construction materials were brought in by barge and hoisted up the cliff with a derrick and a steam-powered hoist. By midsummer 1910 work was complete on the lighthouse, foghorn building, and three houses for the lighthouse keepers. The derrick remained the only way to bring supplies up the cliff until the lighthouse staff built a tramway in 1915-16. The station finally became accessible by a road, now Minnesota State Highway 61, completed in 1929. Five years later a crew from the Civilian Conservation Corps built a new access road and lighthouse tenders were provided with a truck to bring in supplies by land, so the tramway was dismantled. The picturesque lighthouse, perched on a 130-foot cliff overlooking the world's largest lake, began attracting small numbers of visitors within weeks of its opening. However the completion of Highway 61 opened the floodgates to tourism. In 1938 it was estimated that 100,000 visitors stopped by, five times more than any other federally operated lighthouse. Some of the lighthouse keepers' children opened a souvenir stand just outside the station entrance in 1941. Both the U.S. Lighthouse Service and the U.S. Coast Guard which absorbed it in 1939 were obliged to add seasonal staff to help conduct tours. =State park creation= In 1945 Clarence R. Magney, a former mayor of Duluth turned associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court, noticed a sign near the Baptism River reading \\"Lake and River Frontages for Sale.\\" A staunch advocate of public lands on the North Shore, Magney determined to protect some of this land from the development boom that would accompany the end of World War II. At this time Gooseberry Falls was the only Minnesota state park on Lake Superior. A bill promoted by Magney easily passed in the Minnesota Legislature, creating both Baptism River State Park (now Tettegouche State Park) and Split Rock State Scenic Wayside. The wayside consisted of a hill offering a view of the Split Rock Lighthouse. Due to its popularity with tourists, the lighthouse was kept operating well after radar and other technology had rendered it obsolete. However, by 1967 the Coast Guard was considering decommissioning the station. The state legislature acted to expand the wayside into a full-fledged state park including the lighthouse itself. The station was officially closed in 1969 after 59 years of service. Under the Surplus Property Act the grounds and buildings were transferred to the state of Minnesota for free to be operated as a historic site. The state parks division developed an entrance station, picnic grounds, roads, and trails. The Minnesota Historical Society took over management of the lighthouse station in 1976. Over the next decade they restored several buildings to their 1920 appearance and constructed a $1.2 million history center. Meanwhile, from 1984 to 1990 the state park spent $555,000 to improve the recreational facilities, including a new access road, picnic area, and all-season trail shelter, and an expanded trail system. They also developed the park's first campground, an unconventional design in which campers wheel their equipment to their sites in carts provided by the park. The Split Rock Trading Post, just outside and unaffiliated with the state park, operated from 1960 up to 1999, when it burned down in a fire. In addition to a kitschy gift shop, this tourist trap once boasted live bears in cages, the anchor of the Madeira, and a wooden tower offering a view of the lighthouse. Gold Rock Point, the headland just north of the lighthouse, was not originally part of the state park. In 1997 it was purchased from its private owners by the Parks & Trails Council of Minnesota, an organization founded by Clarence Magney, among others, to buy and hold worthy properties until state legislation can authorize their public acquisition.Rebuffoni, Dean. \\"Nonprofit buys tract to expand North Shore state park: plan calls for state to buy 81 scenic acres.\\" Star Tribune November 8, 1997. The next year Nadine Blacklock, a nature photographer and president of the Parks and Trails Council, was killed in a car accident just outside the north end of the park. The Council and the Blacklock Nature Sanctuary, an art and conservation non- profit organization she and her family had founded, jointly purchased of land around the accident site. were transferred to the state park while the remainder, with an existing one-bedroom cabin, is managed by the Blacklock Nature Sanctuary as an artists' retreat.Myers, John. \\"State park gains ground: nonprofit groups will dedicate Split Rock addition, artists' sanctuary to famous nature photographer.\\" Duluth News-Tribune April 13, 2001. The additions were developed with access features for Madeira wreck divers and the Gitchi- Gami State Trail, a paved bicycling route in development along the North Shore. Recreation A hiking trail in the park West Split Rock River alongside the Superior Hiking Trail, approximately 1/2 mile downstream from the Split Rock Camp Sites in the Split Rock State Park area. Split Rock Lighthouse State Park has a unique cart-in campground with 20 secluded campsites and a modern restroom. Campers leave their vehicles in a parking lot and use two-wheeled carts provided by the park to carry their equipment a short distance to their site. There are four backpack campsites along the shore, two accessible to sea kayakers. Conventional drive-in campgrounds managed by the state park are available in two state forests in the area. An expansion of the state park campground, to include 60 drive-in sites, has been approved and construction may begin in summer 2010.\\"Expansion plans unveiled for Split Rock State Park.\\" Duluth News-Tribune October 3, 2009. The park contains of trails for hiking, bicycling, and cross-country skiing. There are several overlooks providing views of the lighthouse and Lake Superior. A paved section of the Gitchi-Gami State Trail runs through the park near the shore, while the Superior Hiking Trail runs inland and skirts both the Split Rock River and Split Rock Creek. There is a lakeshore picnic area and two picnic shelters, one open year-round. Water recreation includes boating, sea kayaking, and fishing for lake trout, salmon, and brown trout. The park also provides scuba diving access to the Madeira wreck, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. Divers can also see parts of the Madeira in Little Two Harbors, where they were dumped in 1974 after an aborted salvage operation. Underwater artifacts from the settlements of Splitrock and Little Two Harbors can be seen in their respective bays. = Park events = The park's trail center hosts various public events, including music performances, nature walks, and history programs. Every year on November 10th, the beacon of the lighthouse is lighted to commemorate the sunken SS Edmund Fitzgerald. This event attracts nearly 900 people each year.

He wrote more than 20 books on travel, history, and biography. Early life, military service, and education Horne was born on 9 November 1925. He was the only son of Sir Allan Horne (died 1944) and Auriol (n√©e Hay- Drummond), niece of the 13th Earl of Kinnoull. He was educated at Eastacre, then Ludgrove School when it was at Cockfosters and described Ludgrove as a place of \\"humbug, snobbery and rampant, unchecked bullying\\" which he thought was intended to toughen the boys up. He seems to have hated Stowe, which he escaped from to America during wartime.he wrote in A Bundle from Britain (1993) that it was full of \\"bullying and buggery.\\" This was a social phenomenon often associated with old-fashioned English public schools, see Christopher Hibbert, No Ordinary Place: Radley College and the Public School System 1847‚Äì1997 (1997), John Murray, London. . As a boy during World War II, Horne was sent to live in the United States. He attended Millbrook School, where he befriended William F. Buckley, Jr., who remained a lifelong friend. Horne served in the RAF (1943‚Äì44) and later as an officer in the Coldstream Guards (1944‚Äì47). He graduated from Jesus College, Cambridge, as a Master of Arts (MA) and received the degree of LittD from the University of Cambridge (1993). Personal life He married, first, in 1953, Renira Hawkins, the daughter of Admiral Sir Geoffrey Hawkins, and had three daughters. The marriage was dissolved, and in 1987 he married, secondly, Sheelin Lorraine Ryan, an artist and former wife of Hon Simon Eccles. He lived with his wife Sheelin at Turville, Buckinghamshire. Career Horne worked as a foreign correspondent for The Daily Telegraph from 1952 to 1955. He was the official biographer of British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, a work originally published (in two volumes) in 1988. Horne was an Honorary Fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, and a cricket enthusiast. The Price of Glory: Verdun 1916 received the Hawthornden Prize in 1963. Horne's 1977 book A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954‚Äì1962 received the Wolfson Prize in 1978. Following the 2003 American invasion of Iraq, A Savage War of Peace: Algeria 1954‚Äì1962 came to be of much interest to American military officers, having been recommended to U.S. President George W. Bush by Kissinger. In October 2006 the book was republished and in January 2007, by phone from his home in England, Horne was invited to take part in an Iraq War discussion panel on the Charlie Rose Show on PBS. It was reported, in the 2 July 2007 edition of The Washington Post', that Horne met with President Bush sometime in mid-2007 at the administration's request.\\" He described his visit in a Daily Telegraph article. In 2004, Horne was offered the authorship of former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's official biography but declined due to the daunting amount of work involved and his age and opted instead to write a volume on one year in Kissinger's life (Kissinger: 1973, The Crucial Year, 2009).

The model was also marketed under the name Del Rio Ranch Wagon. Description The impetus for the creation of the Del Rio was Ford's desire to remain in the two-door sport wagon market started by the Chevrolet Nomad and Pontiac Safari and the decision to discontinue the company's original attempt at a sport wagon, the premium Parklane, which failed to entice buyers during 1956, its only year in production. Four-way power seats were available. While the Nomad was Chevrolet's most expensive model, offering a premium vehicle with a show car- inspired body style, the Del Rio was strictly based on an existing product, the utilitarian two-door Ranch Wagon, Ford's least expensive station wagon, as part of the Custom 300 series. Beginning with the basic body, buyers of the Del Rio were offered a unique two-tone paint scheme (optional), better quality interior and exterior brightwork (including gold anodized aluminum accents) and a higher grade vinyl upholstery. Del Rio buyers also had their choice of either Ford's ‚ÄúMileage Maker‚Äù 144 hp six or its ‚ÄúThunderbird‚Äù 215 hp, 312 cubic inch (5.1 litre) displacement Y-Block V-8. The Del Rio was equipped with 11-inch front drum brakes. Like all other Ford station wagons at that time, the Del Rio used a two-piece tailgate ‚Äì a feature that dealers emphasized was an advantage over GM's steeply raked rear gate and self-storing window, which were known for water leaks in heavy rains. While the Ford sold more Del Rios in 1957 (46,105) than Chevrolet did with its Nomad in its three years of production, Ford terminated the Del Rio program at the end of the 1958 model year after selling only 12,687 of its \\"sport wagons\\". Ford didn't entirely abandon the concept of a two-door station wagon, and used a smaller version with the all-new Ford Falcon in 1960, offered in multiple bodystyles, including a two-door station wagon. 1958 Ford Del Rio Ranch Wagon (with after- market wheels)  References  Del Rio Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Station wagons Motor vehicles manufactured in the United States ","title":"Ford Del Rio"},{"id":"1783605","text":"Great Divide is the debut studio album by American rock band Semisonic.

The structure was designed by lighthouse engineer Ralph Russell Tinkham and was completed in 1910 by the United States Lighthouse Service at a cost of $75,000, including the buildings and the land. It is considered one of the most picturesque lighthouses in the United States. History Split Rock Lighthouse was built in response to the great loss of ships during the famous Mataafa Storm of 1905, in which 29 ships were lost on Lake Superior. One of these shipwrecks, the Madeira, is located just north of the lighthouse. It is built on a sheer cliff eroded by wave action from a diabase sill containing inclusions of anorthosite. The octagonal building is a steel-framed brick structure with concrete trim on a concrete foundation set into the rock of the cliff. It is topped with a large, steel lantern which features a third order, bi-valve type Fresnel lens manufactured by Barbier, Bernard and Turenne Company in Paris, France. The tower was built for a second order lens, but when construction went over budget, there was only enough funding remaining for the smaller third order lens. The lens floats on a bearing surface of liquid mercury which allows near frictionless operation. The lens is rotated by an elaborate clockwork mechanism that is powered by weights running down the center of the tower which are then reset by cranking them back to the top. When completed, the lighthouse was lit with an incandescent oil vapor lamp that burned kerosene. At the time of its construction, there were no roads to the area and all building materials and supplies arrived by water and lifted to the top of the cliff by crane. The light was first lit on July 31, 1910. Thanks to its dramatic location, the lighthouse soon became a tourist attraction for sailors and excursion boats. So much so, that in 1924 a road (now Minnesota State Highway 61) was built to allow land access. In 1940, the station was electrified and the lamp was replaced with a 1000 watt electric bulb, and the incandescent oil vapor lamp was moved to Au Sable Point Lighthouse in Northern Michigan. Split Rock was outfitted with a fog signal housed in a building next to the light tower. The original signal was a pair of sirens driven by two Franklin gasoline-driven air compressors manufactured by Chicago Pneumatic Tool Company. In 1932 the gasoline engines were replaced with diesel engines. The steam sirens were replaced with a Type F-2-T diaphone (be-you) type signal in 1936. The station and the fog signal were electrified four years later, but discontinued in 1961. The light was retired in 1969 by the U. S. Coast Guard. The lighthouse is now part of the Split Rock Lighthouse State Park and is operated by the Minnesota Historical Society. The site includes the original tower and lens, the fog signal building, the oil house, and the three keepers' houses. It is restored to appear as it did in the late 1920s. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. Notwithstanding that the light has been retired, every November 10 the lighthouse emits a light in memory of the SS Edmund Fitzgerald which sank on that date in 1975. On June 30, 2011, the lighthouse was designated as a National Historic Landmark. The lighthouse keeper, Lee Radzak, worked at the lighthouse from 1982-2019, the longest tenure of any lighthouse keeper at the site. In art The United States Postal Service issued a stamp that featured the light on June 17, 1995. It was one of five lighthouses chosen for the \\"Lighthouses of the Great Lakes\\" series postage stamp designed by Howard Koslow in 1995. There was one lighthouse chosen on each of the Great Lakes. The five lighthouses are Split Rock Light on Lake Superior, St Joseph Light on Lake Michigan, Spectacle Reef Light on Lake Huron,Postage stamp artwork, Spectacle Reef Lighthouse Stamp. Marblehead Light (Ohio) on Lake EriePostage stamp artwork, Marblehead Lighthouse Stamp. and Thirty Mile Point Light on Lake Ontario.

The taxonomy is potentially confusing, and it sometimes includes the members of the T. assimilis group as subspecies, in which case the \\"combined species\\" is referred to as the white-throated thrush (a name limited to T. assimilis when the two are split). On the contrary, it may be split into two species, the rufous-flanked thrush (T. albicollis) and the grey-flanked thrush (T. phaeopygos). Description This thrush is long and weighs .Collar (2005) The upperparts are dark brown, turning duskier or greyer towards the ocular region. The throat is white with dense dark streaks, except on the lowermost part, resulting in the appearance of a white crescent below the dark-streaked white throat. This has given rise to both its English and scientific name. The crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca) and central belly are whitish, and the chest is grey often tinged brown. The members of the nominate group have conspicuous rufous flanks, and the bill is yellow with a dusky culmen. The flanks are paler and more tawny in the subspecies crotopezus, which also has the entire upper mandible dusky. The members of the phaeopygos group lack contrasting rufous or tawny flanks, and have bills that are almost entirely dusky. All subspecies have pinkish-brown legs and a reddish or yellow eye-ring. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are duller, with dull orange spotting above, and brownish spotting below.Restall et al. (2006) The song is a relatively musical, often rather monotonousHilty (2003) '. The calls is a distinctive ', while the alarm is a rough '. Distribution and habitat The nominate group (including subspecies paraguayensis and crotopezus) occurs in eastern Brazil, far northern Uruguay, eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina. The phaeopygos group (including subspecies phaopygoides, spodiolaemus and contemptus) is mainly found in the Amazon Basin, but with populations extending along the eastern slope of the Andes as far south as north-eastern Argentina, and as far north as western Venezuela, with extensions along the Coastal Range, the region centered around Serran√≠a del Perij√° and Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, and the islands of Trinidad and Tobago. Both groups are mainly associated with humid forest and woodland. In the case of the nominate group, mainly the Atlantic Forest, and in the case of the phaeopygos group, mainly the Amazon Rainforest or humid forests and woodlands near mountains. It rarely ventures far from cover. Behavior The white-necked thrush mainly feeds on or near the ground on invertebrates. It also takes some fruit and berries. It regularly follows army ant swarms, but does not attend mixed species flocks. Throughout most of its range, especially in the Amazon, it is a shy species, heard far more than seen, but in Trinidad and parts of south-eastern Brazil it may be less retiring. White-necked thrush at nest The nest is a lined cup of twigs placed low (at a height of ) in a tree or bush. Two to three reddish-blotched green- blue eggs are laid and incubated by the female alone for 12‚Äì13 days. Social mongamous, but extra-pair mate are common. Taxonomy T. albicollis sometimes includes the members of the T. assimilis group as subspecies, in which case the \\"combined species\\" is referred to as the white-throated thrush (a name limited to T. assimilis when the two are split). Published evidence supporting either treatment is weak, but most recent authorities have followed the split.Remsen et al. (2008) On the contrary, it has been suggested that the nominate group and the phaeopygos group of T. albicollis should be considered separate species, but the voices of the two are similar, and the subspecies crotopezus from the nominate group approach members of the phaeopygos group in both plumage and colour of bill.Ridgely & Greenfield (1989) If the two groups are split, the common name rufous-flanked thrush has been suggested for T. albicollis, with T. phaeopygos retaining the common name white-necked thrush or being renamed grey-flanked thrush.

Band history Link 80 started in the summer 1993 in the East Bay of California. In the beginning, original members (guitarist Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, drummer Joey Bustos, bassist Adam Pereira and singer Jeff Acree) played around town as Drano, The Rag-Tags, and Mr. Slave-Unit, before settling on Link 80. The name came from the interstate highway I-80 which they used to get to the drummer's garage for band practice and connected the band members' homes: members lived in Oakland, Berkeley and Richmond. In May 1995, Nick Traina joined the band after meeting Adam at a show in San Francisco's Mission District. Nick's passion and voice combined with the rest of the band to make them different from most ska bands and gave Link 80 the \\"against the rest\\" attitude they display throughout their lyrics. Far more punk than ska and with an energy and a sense of immediacy lacking in pop-oriented ska bands, Link 80 was able to avoid the clich√©s of ska-punk characterized by their peers. As Asian Man Records describes them, they are an energetic blend of ska, punk rock, and hardcore. The band's lyrics, audio samples and album artwork are notable for their diverse use of film and television references including The Twilight Zone, The Usual Suspects, American Me, Happy Gilmore, Stand by Me, Pretty In Pink and I Walked with a Zombie. Link 80. 1996. Adam Pereria, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Aaron Nagel, Joey Bustos, Nick Traina. Berkeley, California. Nick Traina and Adam Pereria at 924 Gilman Street, 1997. =17 Reasons= Recorded in 1996, Link 80 had released their first full- length album titled 17 Reasons, in early 1997. The album consisted of 17 fast and energetic punk rock and skacore songs (and one hidden track, a cover of \\"Who Killed Marilyn?\\" by Misfits). It was also the first album recorded for Asian Man Records (AMR1-AMR4 were originally released on Dill Records). The album title and a song title (\\"Turn It Around\\") come from two of the band's favorite local Bay Area punk rock compilations: Turn It Around! and 17 Reasons: The Mission District. Their only official music video was off this album for the song \\"Verbal Kint.\\" The video was partially filmed at 924 Gilman Street and directed by Scott Pourroy. In 1996, with all the members still in high school, the band left for their first U.S. tour. On this tour, the band created their own \\"crew,\\" known as ATRC, or Against the Rest Crew. Matt Bettinelli-Olpin at 924 Gilman Street, 1997. The core line-up for these definitive years was Nick Traina (vocals), Joey Bustos (drums), Matt Bettinelli-Olpin (guitar, vocals), Adam Pereira (bass, vocals) and Aaron Nagel (trumpet). Though he was not present on the recording of 17 Reasons, Jason Lechner (saxophone) joined the band in time to support it at shows and on tour. This line-up would release the first and second of their three albums. Unlike many bands, each member of Link 80 were an integral part of the songwriting team. With Aaron in charge of the horn lines, Joey, Adam and Matt were behind most songs' core-music, while Nick and Matt were responsible for the lyrics. In addition, everyone participated in background vocals, occasionally even singing lead. For example, Adam sings a majority of \\"Termination\\" and \\"Slap,\\" while Matt provides the lead vocals on \\"Turn It Around.\\" The following year Link 80 was on to its second US tour. Beginning in Oregon on June 14, the tour was cut short after a show at the Globe in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 1. The following morning the band went their separate ways, with some members flying home, some driving, and some taking a train. Berkeley Square, 1997 =Killing Katie= Link 80's last album with Nick, Matt and Seth Blankenship, Killing Katie, was released August 26, 1997, less than one month before Nick's death. The album contains 8 studio tracks and 3 hidden live songs, including the long-time crowd pleaser \\"Blank Mind\\" (of which there is no studio version). Of the four hidden tracks, the first is a cover of Buffalo Springfield's \\"For What It's Worth,\\" referred to as \\"Everybody Look What's Going Down\\" by the band. After Link 80, Nick started a new band, Knowledge, and immediately began playing shows and recording. Shortly thereafter, on September 20, 1997, Nick, who suffered from bipolar disorder, overdosed on his fourth suicide attempt, and was found dead by his caretaker at his home. Link 80 in 2000. Joey Bustos, Ryan Nobel, Adam Davis, Steve Borth, Adam Pereria, Aaron Nagel. =The Struggle Continues= With Nick gone, Link 80 needed someone to fill in on vocals. After recruiting a man named Stoney Moak to fill in for vocals temporarily for their shows, Ryan Noble from the Blast Bandits was chosen to pick up permanently where Nick had left off. Along with Ryan and Adam Davis, who took over for Matt, came a new sound and lyrics, while still maintaining the \\"against the rest\\" attitude. Link 80 began to lead more towards a hardcore/ska sound rather than a punk/ska sound. With Ryan, Link 80 recorded the album The Struggle Continues as well as some b-sides that appeared on various compilations in 1999 and toured numerous times with such bands as Capdown and MU330. The last track on The Struggle Continues, \\"Unbroken\\", was written by ex-guitarist Matt for Nick after his death. =Reunion= Top Row: Aaron Nagel. Middle Row: Adam Pereria, Adam Davis, Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Jason Lechner. Bottom Row: Joey Bustos, Ryan Noble, Steve Borth, Barry Krippene. After a few partial reunions over the years, the band's first official reunion was for the Asian Man Records 20th Anniversary shows on June 17 and 18, 2016. Both shows (at the San Francisco's Bottom of the Hill) were sold out. The lineup included singer Ryan Noble, guitarists Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Adam Davis, drummer Joey Bustos, bassists Adam Pereria and Barry Krippene, and horn players Aaron Nagel, Steve Borth and Jason Lechner. Many of the band members brought their kids to the truly epic show. Prior to the shows, a video tribute to Nick Traina was shown with Social Distortion's \\"When the Angels Sing\\" playing over the video. The band released the video online on June 20, 2016. Related bands and projects In 2002, the band consisting of Seth Blankenship, Adam Davis, Aaron Nagel, Steve Borth, Joey Bustos, Barry Krippene, and singer Ryan Noble went on hiatus. Steve Borth would join Rx Bandits, before forming his own band Satori in 2006. The remaining Link 80 members would form DESA. They have since maintained that Link 80 would return, but for now they are focused on their respective projects. Joey and Ryan are currently in The Soft White Sixties (playing drums and bass, respectively). Matt formed a band called Dolores (with Nick's brother Todd Traina) that released on 7\\" on Johann's Face Records, founded the filmmaking collectives Chad, Matt & Rob and Radio Silence and directed the films V/H/S, Devil's Due, and Southbound (all of which feature Link 80 and other Asian Man Records artists including Alkaline Trio, MU330, Laura Stevenson and the Cans and The Atom Age). Aaron is now a successful artist who runs Two Twenty Two Design Studio and whose work has been feature in galleries around the world and can be seen on the covers of The Resignation and ...And the Battle Begun. Adam Davis is currently in Gnarboots which has released their album A.L.B.U.M. on Asian man Records. Barry is in a band called Terrible Timing with a former member of the Blast Bandits. Adam Pereria played with Thought Crime after leaving Link 80. Nick Traina started Knowledge before his death in 1997. Their album, A Gift Before I Go, was subsequently released by Asian Man Records. As of 2019, Steve Borth and Adam Davis are a part of a new ska/punk project, Omnigone and will be releasing an album on Bad Time Records this year.

Soils typically inherit a great deal of structure and minerals from their parent material, and, as such, are often classified based upon their contents of consolidated or unconsolidated mineral material that has undergone some degree of physical or chemical weathering and the mode by which the materials were most recently transported. Consolidated Parent materials that are predominantly composed of consolidated rock are termed residual parent material. The consolidated rocks consist of igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic rock, etc. =Residual= Soil developed in residual parent material is that which forms in consolidated geologic material. Unconsolidated Parent material is classified by its last means of transport. Material that was transported to a location by glacier, then deposited elsewhere by streams, is classified as stream-transported parent material, or glacial fluvial parent material. =Ice transported= Glacial till is material dragged with a moving ice sheet. Because it is not transported with liquid water, the material is not sorted by size. =Water transported= Within water transported parent material there are several important types. Parent material transported by streams is called alluvium of which there are three main types. Floodplains are the parts of river valleys that are covered with water during floods. Due to their seasonal nature, floods create stratified layers in which larger particles tend to settle nearer the channel and smaller particles settle nearer the edges of the flooding area. Alluvial fans are sedimentary areas formed by narrow valley streams that suddenly drop to lowlands and widen dramatically. Sedimentary in these types of deposits tend to be larger closer to the uplands and finer near the edges of the fan. Delta deposits, the third of type of alluvium, are finer sediments that are discharged from streams into lakes and eventually settle near the mouth of the river. Lake deposited parent material is called lacustrine parent material. Beach ridges may be present where glacial lakes once washed up sand. Lacustrine material is well sorted and fine-textured, having finer silts and clays. Soils formed from lacustrine parent material have low permeability in part because of this high clay content. Ocean deposited parent materials, called marine sediments, are collections of material that have been carried by rivers and streams to the ocean and eventually sink to the bottom. Such materials can vary in texture. =Gravity transported= Collections of large rock fragments that have traveled downslope by gravity are called colluvial debris or colluvium. =Wind transported= Parent materials can also be transported by wind, which includes loess and wind-blown (aeolian) sand.  Climate and weathering  Climate is generally considered the most important factor influencing physical and chemical weathering processes. Physical weathering is especially important during the early stages of soil development. Rock can be disintegrated by changes in temperature which produces differential expansion and contraction. Changes in temperature can also cause water to freeze. The forces produced by water freezing can be as great as 2.1 √ó 105 kPa, which can split rocks apart, wedge rocks upward in the soil, and heave and churn soil material. Chemical weathering: the principal agent is percolating rainwater charged with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Parent material becomes hydrolyzed by the acidic solution to produce minerals and to release cations.

Cear√° is one of the most traditionally successful clubs in the Northeast region of Brazil alongside Bahia, Santa Cruz, Sport, N√°utico, Vit√≥ria and their city rivals Fortaleza. History On June 2, 1914, the club was founded as Rio Branco Football Club by Luiz Esteves Junior and Pedro Freire. Later, some of their friends also joined: Gilberto Gurgel, Walter Barroso, Raimundo Justa, Newton R√¥la, Bol√≠var Purcell, Alu√≠sio Mamede, Orlando Olsen, Jos√© Elias Romcy, Isa√≠as Fa√ßanha de Andrade, Raimundo Padilha, Rolando Em√≠lio, Meton Alencar Pinto, Gotardo Morais, Artur de Albuquerque, Cincinato Costa, Carlos Calmon and Eurico Medeiros. As Rio Branco Football Club, the team colors were white and lilac. In 1915, on their first birthday, the club changed its name to Cear√° Sporting Club. In 1941, Cear√° won the Campeonato Cearense, the same year of the inauguration of Presidente Vargas stadium. From 1961 to 1963, the club was three times consecutive state champion. In 1969, Cear√° won the Northeast Cup. In 1970, ended the seven-year titleless state championship period. In 1971, Cear√° was the last placed team in Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie A first edition. From 1975 to 1978, the club was four times in a row state champion. In 1985, Cear√° finished 7th in the Brazilian League. This is the best league position of a team from Cear√° State in the Brazilian Championships. In 1994, the club finished Brazilian Cup runners-up, beaten by Gr√™mio in the final. In 1995, Cear√° participated in the Copa CONMEBOL, the club's first international championship, becoming the only club of Cear√° State to play an international tournament. In 1996, the team administrator was Forr√≥ bands businessman Emanuel Gurgel. The team changed its home shirt color to all black. Because of this, the team was nicknamed \\"Urubu do Nordeste\\" (Northeast Vulture). From 1996 to 1999, the club was state champion four times in a row . In 2002, Cear√° won the state championship, for the first time in three years. In 2005, Cear√° reached the Copa do Brasil semifinals. The club was defeated by Fluminense. In 2006, the club won the state championship after 4 years without winning the competit In 2010, after a 17-year absence, Cear√° was promoted back to the Brazilian League, after finishing third in the 2009 Campeonato Brasileiro S√©rie B. They finished in 12th position, achieving a place in the 2011 Copa Sudamericana. In 2011, Cear√° reached the 2011 Copa do Brasil semi-finals. Cear√° ended Ronaldinho's Flamengo's unbeaten streak in the previous round winning the away game, and drew the home game, eliminating the Rio de Janeiro team in a notorious upset. Cear√°, however, was defeated by Coritiba in the semi-finals.

The team mascot appeared in late 1919, when Meton de Alencar Pinto, former president of Cear√° SC, coached young players of America Football Club, a small club from the city, in the Porangabussu training center. Meton, who used to call the kids as \\"my grandsons\\", asked them to \\"go easy on grandpa\\". Afterwards, the nickname started to apply to the team of Cear√° as well, helped by the seniority of the club; Cear√° Sporting Club was the first football team founded in the state.

These individuals suppress feelings of anger or sorrow even when they are in an environment that is supportive of emotional expression, such as suppressing anger when clearly justified, or refusing to cry at a funeral. The type D individual tends to be anxious, irritable, insecure, and uncomfortable with strangers. These types of people are constantly experiencing and anticipating negative emotions, which results in their being more tense and inhibited around others. History The type D personality was defined in the 1990s, describing individuals who experience feelings of negativity, depression, anxiety, stress, chronic anger, and loneliness. The distressed personality type is also prone to pessimism, low self-esteem, and difficulty making personal connections with others. It is thought that about 20% of otherwise-healthy Americans fall under this category.\\"Type D Personality: How Distress Affects Your Health\\" In 1996, Dr. Denollet reported a longitudinal study of 286 men and women who had enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation program. At the beginning of the program, each participant filled out a questionnaire in order to determine whether they fell under the type D pattern. Eight years later, researchers tracked down the participants in order to find out who had died, and who was still alive. Among those who had been classified as type D, 27% had died; meanwhile only 7% of the non-Ds had died. The majority of these deaths were due to heart disease or stroke. Since this study, the type D personality subtype has been thought to be associated with early death, increased risk for developing cardiovascular problems, poorer response to proven treatments for heart disease, and increased chances of sudden cardiac arrest.\\"Type D for Distressed\\" Diagnostic criteria A 14-question scale is used to determine whether an individual can be categorized as having a type D personality type. This scale, the D-Scale 14, aims to measure negativity as well as social inhibition. Each of the 14 items on the scale is rated according to a 5 point Likert scale, from 0 to 4 (false to true). Individuals who score high (above a 10) on both negativity and social inhibition can be classified as type D. This questionnaire was developed based on the idea that individuals who score high on negative affectivity are dysphoric and have a negative view of self. They are also prone to more somatic symptoms, and focus more on negative situations and stimuli. Scoring high on social inhibition means that these individuals tend to avoid the potential 'dangers' involved in social interactions, such as disapproval. Generally speaking, social situations tend to make type D individuals feel inhibited, tense, uncomfortable, and insecure. Health risks A wide variety of health risks are associated with type D personalities, primarily due to the fact that they seem to lead to a more highly activated immune system and therefore, more inflammation. This increase in inflammation can often lead to damaged blood vessels throughout the heart and body. Type D individuals have also been found to have higher blood pressure than normal, as well as an exaggerated response to stress, both physiological and psychological. Among the health issues commonly associated with this personality subtype are depressive and anxiety symptoms, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Additionally, type Ds are might have a predisposition to social phobia, panic disorder, and even the development of avoidant personality disorder. Type D personality: the heart, stress, and cortisol According to Dr. Denollet, what most likely links poor health outcomes to the type D personality subtype is the distinctly high level of stress associated with it. Unlike other personality types who like to vent, type Ds social inhibition leaves them with no such outlet for their stress. This pent-up stress causes high cortisol levels, which, in turn, can lead to high blood pressure as well as chronic, artery-damaging inflammation. It is worth noting that another possible explanation for this correlation is that type Ds likely also suffer from depression, anxiety, and poor social connections, each of which has been linked with poor health and heart disease. =Cardiovascular complications= Both type D dimensions (negative affectivity and social inhibition) are associated with a stress-induced increase in cortisol release. High levels of cortisol are thought to be the mediating factor in the association between this personality type and the increased risk for coronary heart disease. Additionally, the inhibition of emotions that characterizes type D personality types is strongly associated with higher cardiovascular reactivity, lower cardiovascular recovery, lower heart rate variability, carotid atherosclerosis, incidence of coronary heart disease, and cardiac mortality. The correlation between emotional suppression and cardiovascular complications has been observed in numerous different studies, including one that involved patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. In this study, deaths from cardiac causes were increased by a factor of four in those with type D personality, even after controlling for conventional risk factors. Another study, conducted by Appels et al, investigated the effect of type D behavior on sudden cardiac death. This study involved interviewing the next-of-kin of the sudden cardiac death victims to determine whether they were type D or not. Patients scoring high on negative affectivity and social inhibition (the two dimensions of the type D personality subtype) were found to be seven times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death.

Ivoryton Historic District, the historic district in the village, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 15, 2014.Ivoryton Historic District, National Park Service. The Ivoryton Playhouse, which is separately listed on the Register, is located within the district. History and historic district Ivoryton is roughly bounded by Main Street, North Main Street, Oak Street, Blake Street, Summit Street, Park Road, and Comstock Avenue. The area is known as a \\"well-preserved example of a nineteenth-century company town\\" and a world center of the ivory industry. The area became industrialized when Comstock, Cheney & Company, an ivory import business founded by Samuel Merritt Comstock, an Ivoryton native, and his partner George A. Cheney in the 1860s was founded there. The district was one of the several industrial areas in the Connecticut River Valley established late nineteenth century, and is also historically significant as a center for immigrants from Sweden, Germany, Italy, and Poland, who lived in worker housing areas throughout Ivoryton. Pratt, Read & Company was located just a few miles away from Comstock, Cheney & Company along the Connecticut River, and these two largest American ivory manufacturers \\"commanded a monopoly on all ivory production in the United States.\\" The area thrived between 1860 and 1938, and at its height the area employed and housed up to 600 workers. The National Register of Historical Places states: :\\"The historic district consists of early Colonial structures representing the agrarian village before its industrial transformation, mid- to late-nineteenth-century ivory processing and manufacturing buildings, high-style Victorian homes for company executives, modest vernacular homes and tenements for factory workers, and public buildings such as churches, a post office, company store, library, and a town meeting hall. Although some of the factory buildings have been demolished, the industry-defining bleach houses are gone, many houses have been remodeled, and the village itself sustained damage in a flood in 1982, Ivoryton's historic character remains intact as an example of a planned community not unlike more formalized 'company towns' in an industry unique to the Connecticut River Valley. The period of significance ranges from the construction of earliest known extant building (Joseph Parker Homestead; ca. 1719) to the divestment of company-owned housing in 1938.\\" See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut Notes External links *Ivoryton Library Association website with village history *NRHP form - 271 pages with information on the historic district Essex, Connecticut Villages in Middlesex County, Connecticut Villages in Connecticut Ivory ","title":"Ivoryton, Connecticut"},{"id":"1783769","text":"Taree is a town on the Mid North Coast, New South Wales, Australia Taree may also refer to: *City of Greater Taree, a former local government area *Taree Airport (IATA: TRO, ICAO: YTRE) *Taree railway station * \\"Taree\\" (song), a 2012 song by American rock band Soundgarden ","title":"Taree (disambiguation)"},{"id":"1783770","text":"Arborea is a town and comune in the province of Oristano, Sardinia, Italy, whose economy is largely based on agriculture, with production of vegetables, rice and fruit.

The village was populated by families, mostly composed of peasants, who came from the regions of Veneto and Friuli in north-eastern Italy.  Name  Arborea is named for and lies within the medieval Giudicato of Arborea, which had its capital, at various periods, in nearby Tharros and Oristano. The town was originally named Villaggio Mussolini (with which it was inaugurated on October 29, 1928), by the fascist government.

The college has sixteen campus buildings located on bordering the North Umpqua River. The campus also features a track, tennis courts, and an outdoor pool. In 2009, a vineyard was added to the campus. About 3,300 full-time students and 16,000 part-time students attend UCC. Umpqua Community College serves the greater Douglas County region with the exception of Reedsport and its immediate area along the Oregon Coast. History Map of the campus Danny Lang Center In the late 1950s, interested community members formed a committee, sponsored by the American Association of University Women, to explore the idea of establishing a community college in Douglas County. After visiting other campuses, the group wrote a report, and in 1960 the Chamber of Commerce formed an Education Committee with Wayne Crooch as its chair. In February 1960, the Roseburg School Board was asked to approve a program of lower-division college courses. The request was approved and an agreement was established with Southern Oregon College (now Southern Oregon University) and the Oregon University System. Harry Jacoby, assistant Superintendent of the Roseburg School District, was named coordinator of the project. The first college courses were offered in 1961. Classes were first held in rented facilities in Roseburg. The cost was $5 per term and $11 per credit. After meeting the legal requirements for forming a college district, the Oregon State Board of Higher Education ordered establishment of the proposed district on December 11, 1962. Voters supported formation of the district by voting 3,190 \\"yes\\" and 825 \\"no\\" on March 30, 1964. The same election also established the first seven-member board of directors. At the first board meeting on April 2, 1964, Ralph Snyder was appointed registrar and Harry Jacoby was hired as the first president of the college. The land for the campus, of pasture land along a bend in the North Umpqua River, was donated by Elton and Ruth Jackson. The Board accepted the site in February 1965. College construction was funded by a serial levy passed in May 1965 and a bond issue passed in 1968. Additional financing came from interest earnings, state funding, and federal grants. Classes were first held on \\"Phase I\\" of the new campus in Fall 1967. In September 2010, the school started construction on a $6.7 million viticulture education facility to be the home of the school's Southern Oregon Wine Institute. Planned to be opened in 2011, the building will be named the Danny Lang Teaching, Learning and Event Center. On October 1, 2015, a mass shooting occurred on the school campus. Ten people, including the gunman, a 26-year-old UCC student, were killed; seven to nine others were wounded. The shooter killed himself following a brief gun battle with police. Alumni Notable alumni include Alek Skarlatos, one of three Americans who tackled the perpetrator of the attempted Thalys train attack in France in 2015.

It is located 15 kilometres inland from the coast of the Pacific Ocean, on the Macleay Valley Way near where the Pacific Highway and the North Coast railway line cross the Macleay River. It is roughly 345 kilometres north of Sydney. As at June 2018 Kempsey had a population of 15,309. Estimated resident population, 30 June 2018. Kempsey history =European settlement= Enoch William Rudder is credited with founding the settlement. He arrived from Birmingham in 1834 and bought land on the southern bank of the river in 1836, at what was then the limit of authorized settlement (the boundary of County Macquarie). He was initially attracted by red cedar cutting opportunities but planned also to profit by selling parts of his land. He had riverside blocks surveyed and established a private town, with the first blocks sold in November 1836. He called it Kempsey because the surrounding areas reminded him of the Kempsey Valley in Worcestershire. The collapse in red cedar prices in the early 1840s nearly led to the failure of the town.Valley of the Macleay, Marie H. Neil, 1972, The main (and most flood-prone) part of Kempsey was founded by John Verge, sub- dividing a grant on the flood-plain opposite Rudder's settlement. In 1854, a government town was surveyed at West Kempsey and government facilities moved there when it became clear that no town would form around the police station and courthouse at Belgrave Falls. Rudder's settlement was renamed East Kempsey. Kempsey initially flourished as a centre for logging and sawmilling. Large reserves of Australian red cedar Toona australis, (sold in Britain and the USA as \\"Indian mahogany\\") were extracted down until the 1920s, and with greater difficulty until the 1960s, by which time the resource was effectively exhausted. Dairying was the major industry in the area until the 1960s, with a Nestl√© Milo factory at nearby Smithtown, and several cheese and butter factories. =Burnt Bridge= John Moseley was an Aboriginal farmer who moved to Burnt Bridge, Euroka Creek, near Kempsey, in 1892. Like the European farmers in the district, he grew maize. In 1900, Aboriginal children were excluded from Euroka Public School. Moseley, his son Percy and others petitioned for a Aboriginal school, which was created at Burnt Bridge in 1905. Under the Aborigines Protection Act 1909, the Aborigines Protection Board (APB) became responsible for the care and control of Aboriginal people, which included powers to remove children from their families. The APB pursued a policy of taking land from Aboriginal farmers and putting it in the hands of white farmers (by sale or lease). His protests to no avail, Moseley was forced to share-farm on a property he formerly owned. In October 1925, Moseley and Jimmy Linwood addressed a meeting at Kempsey showground organised by the Aborigines Progressive Association. Around 1930, other members of the Moseley family joined John on the farm at Euroka Creek. In 1937 the APB secured a large block next to the farm for the creation of Burnt Bridge Aboriginal Reserve (sometimes referred to as Burnt Bridge Mission). Aboriginal people from various other communities were moved there and forced to live with inadequate housing or a poor water supply. Children were removed from the Reserve, including girls who were taken to the Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls, and became part of the Stolen Generations. The manager of the reserve tried to take over the Moseleys' land, but after several scuffles, stand-offs, a letter to the local press by Moseley, a visit to Sydney by one of his sons, and intervention by Michael Sawtell, the APB agreed to leave them alone. After John's death in July 1938, Percy continued to make a claim on the land; he was then threatened with expulsion. He was granted permissive occupancy of of the old reserve in June 1939, but never won title to the land.  Heritage listings  Kempsey has a number of heritage- listed sites, including: * Belgrave Street: Kempsey Post Office * North Coast railway: Macleay River railway bridge * 67 Smith Street: St Andrew's Presbyterian Church and Hall Climate =Floods= Geographically, Kempsey stretches out around a long loop of the Macleay River at the top of the flood- plain. It is famous for its floods. The 1949 flood was particularly destructive, having washed a large part of the town centre away when the railway viaduct (which was acting as a dam-wall due to a build-up of debris against the approaches to the railway bridge) gave way. The area most affected by this flood is now the site of playing fields. The shire council has a policy of buying up land in areas designated as flood plains and many houses have been transported to higher ground in recent years. Other major floods occurred in 1949, 1950, 1963, 2001, 2009, 2013. Economy Kempsey has a history of economic problems and disadvantage. Of the 10,374 residents in the area 1,573 worked full-time and 1,105 worked part-time. The area has an unemployment rate significantly higher than the national average. A plurality (35.1) of children live in families in which no member works. The median weekly household income is $691, nearly half the national average. Despite a period of economic stagnation in past decades compared to nearby coastal centres of growth, Kempsey has a growing local economy based on tourism, farming and service industries. As a local centre it has many shops and services including three major supermarkets and fast food chain stores such as Subway, McDonald's and KFC. In 2014, the Australian Bureau of Statistics ranked Kempsey as one of the poorest Local Government areas in New South Wales. A Coles supermarket development (known as the \\"Kempsey Central Shopping Centre\\") has been built and is situated where the Tattersalls Hotel and various small businesses were in Little Belgrave Street. This shopping centre opened on 6 December 2008. Target Country closed their department store on 9 June 2018 - this ends a 33 year connection to the Macleay Valley (Fosseys was formerly in town before being rebranded as Target Country). Growing industries include wineries and nut production. Kempsey is a service centre for the nearby coastal resorts of South West Rocks, Arakoon, Hat Head, and Crescent Head, which are popular places for retirees and holiday-makers alike. Demographics According to the 2016 Australian Census the median age in the Kempsey area is 42. 16.7% of residents are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, with the median age of that group being 23. 84.2% of people were born in Australia. compared with the national average of 66.7%. The next most common country of birth was England at 1.6%. 72.8% reported having both parents born in Australia; this is significantly higher than the national average of 47.3%. 84.9% of Kempsey residents spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 23.5%, No Religion 23.1% and Anglican 20.8%. Crime In recent decades Kempsey has attracted attention for its high and rising rate of crime when compared with state averages. In 2016 crime figures released by the NSW Police Force revealed crime levels in Kempsey are two times the state average. Break and enter is a particular problem, with a rate three times the state average. From 2014-2016 most crimes increased in Kempsey, with domestic violence, robbery with a firearm and break and enters all rising. In 2015 it was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald that Kempsey was experiencing violent crime linked to ice addiction. Offences for methamphetamine trafficking are roughly twice the state average. There followed a proactive program of crime prevention and community safety initiatives funded through the Australian, NSW and local government that has seen the town revitalised and crime incidents reduced. The 2016-17 Annual Report of Kempsey Shire Council indicated 80% of residents felt safe in their homes and public spaces. Facilities Government buildings such as the council chambers, library and several offices - are located west of the North Coast Railway line in West Kempsey. This area is not subject to the flooding that the CBD occasionally sees and is seen as a second business district with a variety of businesses and banking facilities. Opened in July 2004, the Mid North Coast Correctional Centre, a minimum to medium prison for 500 male and female inmates, is located in Aldavilla, approximately west of Kempsey. there are plans to add extra housing for more inmates by 2020. Transport Until a new 14.5 kilometre bypass opened on 27 March 2013, the Pacific Highway passed through Kempsey. The former alignment is now known as the Macleay Valley Way. The new bypass included a 3.2 kilometre Macleay River Bridge, the longest bridge in Australia.\\"Kempsey bypass open\\" ABC News 27 March 2013Kempsey bypass completed Roads & Maritime Services Kempsey railway station is located on the North Coast line providing a connection to Sydney and Brisbane.

Jet Moto (1996) and Jet Moto 2 (1997) were developed by SingleTrac, known for Twisted Metal and Twisted Metal 2. SingleTrac then left Sony, the publisher of the series, and Jet Moto 3 (1999) was developed by Pacific Coast Power & Light in their absence. They would also go on to develop Jet Moto 2124, which was cancelled two years into development. A fifth title known as Jet Moto: SOLAR was being developed by RedZone Interactive for the PlayStation 2, but no screenshots or video of gameplay were ever released, and the game was cancelled in 2003. Common gameplay elements Gameplay in the Jet Moto series differs from traditional racing games, as players instead control hoverbikes which hover close above the ground and can be driven over both land and water. Most of the courses in the games are designed to take advantage of this ability. The game has its variant of the traditional road course, but also introduces a new course type, known as a suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints at either end of the course, and the starting grid in the center. Characters race to one end, then turn around to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete. This provides a new gameplay dynamic as often the player must navigate oncoming traffic. Characters are split into teams, and bikes are adorned with logos of products such as Mountain Dew and Butterfinger, similar to real-life sponsored racing. The Jet Moto series utilizes a system called the magnetic grapple. Pressing the assigned button near a red energy pole creates a magnetic attraction between the player's bike the pole. Energy poles are often placed strategically throughout the courses, enabling racers to \\"slingshot\\" around tight turns without slowing down. The magnetic grapple system is also sometimes used to swing over large gaps and chasms otherwise too large to ride over. In addition to the grapple system players are given four boosts per lap, which provide a temporary burst of speed. Games =Jet Moto= In Jet Moto players control hoverbikes known as jet motos. These bikes have the ability to hover over both land and water. The original Jet Moto (Jet Rider in Europe) was developed by SingleTrac and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation and PC. The PlayStation version was released in North America on October 31, 1996, in Europe in February 1997, and Japan on August 7, 1997. The PC version was released on November 30, 1997. On February 4, 2007 Jet Moto was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. Twenty Characters and three tracks are available at the beginning of the game, with seven more tracks unlockable by winning tournaments. Traditional tracks are also included, and typical courses range from beaches with debris-littered water, ice-covered mountains, and even a floating track set above a city. At the time of its release Jet Moto was seen as Sony's response to Nintendo's Wave Race 64. Reviews for the game were mixed, and Jet Moto the PC version currently holds 75% and the PlayStation version 78.9% at gaming aggregator GameRankings. Reviewers felt the game had solid gameplay, but criticized its high difficulty. Several reviewers also praised the soundtrack to the game. Game Revolution called the Dick Dale-esque music \\"reminiscent of spy tunes from James Bond movies\\". The surf guitar was a strong point for Electric Playground, who cited it as one of the best video game soundtracks of 1996. GameSpot reviewer Shane Mooney said the soundtrack was \\"just the adrenaline pump [he] needed.\\" Jet Motos popularity would earn it a spot in the PlayStation Greatest Hits in August 1998. =Jet Moto 2= Jet Moto 2 (known as Jet Rider 2 in Europe and Jet Moto '98 in Japan) was released exclusively for the PlayStation video game console in 1997. A greatest hits version of the game was also released. Due to an error during the disc printing process, a special edition version, Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition was printed instead of the original. This version featured six fewer competitors, but increased the game's speed to 30 frames per second. Jet Moto 2 was added to the PlayStation Network in January 2008. The amount of playable characters for this game was halved in comparison to the first game, with ten characters available at the beginning of the game and one unlockable character. Track amounts were greatly increased, however, with ten new tracks, and tracks from the original game. All the original Jet Moto tracks were locked from the start. The first original track became available to play after all of Jet Moto 2's tracks were unlocked. Once the player got third place or better on one of the original tracks it would become unlocked and next original track would be available to play. Due to an error in printing all of the original tracks were unlocked from the start in the greatest hits version of the game, and ran at a faster speed than the original - albeit with only four racers. Tracks are more varied than Jet Moto, with each level containing a unique theme rather than the shared themes of the original game. The courses range from earthquake- damaged cities, desert Canyons, ice-covered mountains, roller Coasters, and several others. The difficulty was higher in this game; the developers used gameplay recordings in place of fully developed racer AI, so most racers had a perfect run and any mistakes made by the player would result in a quick loss of top racing positions. Dual Analog Controllers were supported for the first time, as well as DualShock Controllers but without any vibration feedback. =Jet Moto 3= Jet Moto 3 was released exclusively for the PlayStation in North America only on August 31, 1999. A new developer and publisher would take over the series, Pacific Coast Power & Light and 989 Sports. It was released on the PlayStation Network on February 21, 2008 but was removed shortly thereafter for undisclosed reasons. This Jet Moto is notable for the inclusion of new stunt tracks. The objective of these tracks is to perform stunts to gain higher points and to collect coins scattered throughout the track. Another notable inclusion is the hop button, which is used to boost your player above the ground to avoid obstacles. The physics also were given an overhaul. Many times your bike travels so fast that you will be stuck riding on walls. Graphics were also considerably smoother as the game was released two years after the original games, however suffered greatly due to the use of heavy texturing as was common for PlayStation games of the time. Track themes vary greatly, with tracks taking places in volcanic islands, catacombs, the heights of Machu Pichu, and a thick Sequoia forest. DualShock Controller support was added to this installment. =Jet Moto 2124= Concept art of a light jet moto for Jet Moto 2124. Art by Laura Janczewski. A fourth Jet Moto, called Jet Moto 2124, was being developed at Sony's 989 Studio in San Diego and was set to be based in the future. Production on the game began prior to the completion of Jet Moto 3. Level designers used Alias Power Animator 8.5 to create tracks for the game. Developers took inspiration from Syd Mead when coming up with concepts and designs for the game. Jet Moto 2124 would be the first in the series to take the player to locations off Earth, including Mars, the moon and one of Jupiter's moons, Europa. Additional real- world sponsors had been solicited for in-game sponsoring, including Doritos, Slim Jim, and Body Glove. The game was to have redesigned physics and increased speed, giving 2124 \\"the Jet Moto feel but with Wipeout speed.\\" Inspiration was also taken from freestyle motocross, and the ability would have been given to the player to do in air-tricks such as the heel clicker and can-can, similar to modern day tricks performed on specialized dirtbikes. Developers cited lack of marketing support, camera issues and a flawed physics model for the jet motos as a few of the main concerns with the game's development. Other concerns included a new company president that did not support the game, and the studio director seeking to widen all the tracks, causing a significant increase in development time. These, along with lackluster sales of Jet Moto 3 caused the game to be cancelled two years into production, just prior to beta testing. =Jet Moto: SOLAR= In 2003 a PlayStation 2 project known as Jet Moto: SOLAR was rumored to be in development by RedZone Interactive, however no press releases or gameplay information were released to the public. On April 4, 2003 in minor coverage by IGN, the game was confirmed to be cancelled, subsequently confirming its development. A software design document and a document containing fictional character bios for the game surfaced in 2005 on the personal website of George Rothrock, co-founder of RedZone Interactive. SOLAR was set several hundred years after the original Jet Moto series, when the hover technology from the jet moto bikes had evolved into a new style of moto, the Gravity Resistant Vehicle (GRV). Locales would again expand to other locations off Earth, including Mars, the moon, and Ganymede, one of the moons of Jupiter.

It is bounded by the River Severn on the west, and the A38 main road runs through it and is about 3 miles south of Worcester. The village has a long history. Its name is derived from the Saxon \\"Kemys' Eye\\", or the island of Kemys. Kemys was a Saxon chief, whose island lay between marshes and the River Severn. One of the roads in Kempsey, Lyf's Lane, is named after another Saxon chief. The village was recorded in the 11th century Domesday Book as having a value of ¬£7. The local Anglican church of St. Mary was built between the 12th century and 15th centuries, and the 15th century tower is 82 feet tall. The composer Sir Edward Elgar lived in the village from 1923 to 1927, during which time he was made Master of the King's Music. The village has several pubs including one named after Bishop Walter de Cantilupe. Etymology Kempsey is named after a Saxon chief, Kemys. The full name means \\"Kemys' Eye\\", as the original settlement, where the church now stands, was a semi-island between the River Severn and marshland.St. Mary's Church, Kempsey Worcestershire 1984 Kempsey Collection Re-printed with additions 1990. History =Pre-Roman Kempsey= A piece of iron dated 1500-800 BC According to 'Kempsey Collection' page 9, a piece of iron dated 1500-800 BC was dug up in the Court Meadow area, and is now in the Foregate Museum, Worcester. At that time the River Severn was tidal at Kempsey, and there was extensive marshland and forest in the Severn valley. An Iron Age promontory fort can be found by the Severn at Kempsey. =Roman Kempsey= Roman Milestone A Roman milestone dedicated to the Emperor Constantine the Great (AD 307 ‚Äì 337) was found in about 1818 when ground was being levelled for a vegetable garden for Court House, opposite the west gate of the churchyard. According to O'Neil,O'Neil, Helen E. 1956 \\"Court House Excavations, Kempsey, Worcestershire\\", in Transactions of the Worcestershire Archaeological Society pp. 33‚Äì44 this was probably not its original position as the nearest Roman road was about a mile away. It could have previously been used as masonry for the Bishop's Palace due to the lack of suitable building stone in Kempsey. The Victoria County History entry describes this as \\"an inscription found some years before 1818, lying in two pieces with other stones 4 feet deep in the west wall of the kitchen garden of the parsonage farm, north-west of the church. Many of the other stones were cemented together and formed some kind of ancient foundation; whether the inscription was one of these, is not recorded. It is itself a flat slab of freestone, 33 inches high by 20 inches wide, and is now in the Worcester Museum. It reads as follows:O'Neil, Helen E. 1956 'Court House Excavations, Kempsey, Worcestershire', in 'Transactions of the Worcestershire Archaeological Society' pp. 33‚Äì44 > Val(erio) Constantine P(io) fe(lici) invicto Aug(usto) > 'Emperor Valerius Constantinus, pious, fortunate, unconquerable, Augustus.' > \\"Probably the commencement of the inscription is lost; it may have begun IMP. CAES FL. Imp(eratori) Cs(ari) Fl(avio). Flavius Valerius Constantinus was Constantine the Great, and this stone was presumably set up in his reign (A.D. 308-337). It appears to be a milestone, or rather a road-stone, of the type common in the fourth century, in which the mileage was often omitted - though here it might have been broken off. But it might conceivably be no more than an honorary slab.\\" The stone is from the Oolites of the Cotswold Hills.

St. Joseph, writing in The Journal of Roman Studies, in a section on Roman Villas, \\"At Kempsey (SO 848485), four miles south of Worcester, two rectangular ditched enclosures seem to belong to the same class\\" (i.e. Villa enclosures having slightly curved sides). \\"One, which measures about 250 ft. by 100 ft., has a single entrance in the middle of the short eastern side, while two of the sides are curved, the southern being bowed inwards.\\"St. Joseph, J. K. (1953). Air Reconnaissance of Southern Britain. Journal of Roman Studies, 43 (1953) 81-97. Roman roads through and near Kempsey There are three possible Roman roads through and near Kempsey. One may have run along Old Road South, entering the oldest area of the village where a Roman camp might have been, and exiting possibly along Lyf's Lane (although Lyf was a Saxon chief) and continuing to the Roman settlement at Worcester. The second runs along the side of the present M5 motorway north by Holdings Lane to Taylor's Lane, where it enters St Peter the Great, Worcester. The third, Green Street, connects Kempsey Common with the centre of the village, crossing the second Roman road mentioned above at Palmer's Cross. Roman finds from archeological digs Pottery, brooches and a coin from the time of the Emperor Nero were found in burial cists dug out of the gravel beds north of the church. =Celtic tribe= The Celtic tribe that lived around Kempsey in Roman times were the Dobunni. Dark Ages Kempsey was part of the Anglo- Saxon Kingdom of Hwicce, and then a part of the Kingdom of Mercia. =The King of Mercia and Kempsey Monastery= Coenwulf, King of Mercia, gave Abbot Balthun of Kempsey Monastery thirty smallholdings in return for the military service and maintenance work of Kempsey locals, according to the Victoria County History of Worcestershire.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43148&strquery;=Kempsey An archaeological digWorcester Archaeology No.27: October 2011: Worcestershire Archaeology Research Report No.7: Archaeological investigations on the Kempsey Flood Alleviation Scheme https://www.explorethepast.co.uk/wp- content/uploads/2018/12/swr24628.pdf in 2011 at the top of the bank between the church and the river excavated 42 skeletons and left more in place, and carbon 14 dating of four skeletons gave a range between the 9th and the 13th centuries A.D. The field team found skeletons from a cross-section of the local population including males, females and children. According to a speech by Tom Vaughn of the archaeology society in May 2012, there were skeletons with an age range of approximately 12 to 70 years old, and there were so many skeletons that in one place they were buried seven deep. In those days the Bishop's palace and Anglo-Saxon minster sent priests out to local parishes preaching and converting, because the country had reverted to paganism after the Romans left. The dead were brought from a wide area to Kempsey for burial, because the only Christian consecrated grounds in the area were at Kempsey and at Worcester Cathedral. As other local parishes developed there was less need for this, and Kempsey church's graveyard therefore contracted to its present size. =Danish Raiders= To commemorate the departure of the Danes Bishop Aelhun built an oratory dedicated to St. Andrew. Then the Danes raided again, and the monastery was destroyed. In 799 AD the population was about 150. =The Domesday Book= The Domesday Book says of Kempsey: In the Hundred (Oswaldslow) The Bishop of the same Churche (Worcester) holds Chemesege (Kempsey) . There are 24 hides paying geld, 5 of these are waste. There are 2 ploughs in the demesne, 13 villeins, and 27 bordars with 16 ploughs. There is a priest, 4 serfs and 2 bondswomen and 40 acres of meadow. The woodland is a mile long and ¬Ω a mile wide. There are 13 hides in the demesne.

On 2 August 1265 Henry III was brought as a prisoner to Kempsey by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester and leader of the English barons. Bishop Walter de Cantelupe (who the pub known as \\"the Wally\\" is named after) said Mass for him in Kempsey church the next morning, before they set off to the Battle of Evesham, where de Montfort was killed. King Edward I of England (visited 1276) & with Queen Marguerite (26 December 1281) The Black Death The population of Kempsey fell from 600 in 1299 to only 86 in 1327. Beheading In 1303, the Reeve (the Lord's official on the manor) of Kempsey beheaded John de Draycote, a clerk, on the highway between Kempsey and Draycote, by order of the bishops bailiff. His head was placed before the Bishop's Palace gates, causing a riot, which was put down.Kempsey Collection p.14 Alexander Neckham Alexander Neckham, Abbot of Cirencester, was born on the same night as Richard the Lion-heart, and was brought up as his foster-brother. He was the first Englishman to write about chess, silkworms and the mariner's compass. He died at Kempsey in 1217, while visiting his friend Bishop Silvester.Fraser, Maxwell 'Companion to Worcestershire' p.11 =Civil War= The Civil War started in 1642, and Kempsey was quickly involved. On 22 September Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes and Colonel Samuel Sandys, Governor of Worcester, led a detachment of Lord Essex's Parliamentary Army across the Severn at Pixham Ferry. The forces of Prince Rupert beat them at the Battle of Powick Bridge on Powick Ham, and many of the fugitives re-crossed the river at Kempsey.Kempsey Collection However, Green writes that the victory went to the Roundheads, and that Prince Rupert was forced to flee. Kempsey was raided on 2 July 1646, in an attempt to capture a Colonel Betsworth in his quarters. He was forewarned and eluded capture. According to Rev. Purton, \\"During the siege of Worcester in 1646, a squadron of 400 dragoons, under Colonel Betsworth, was quartered at Kempsey and on 2 July an attempt was made by the garrison to seize him there, which was unsuccessful.\\" John Noake speaks of a tradition then current in the parish that Cromwell \\"personally superintended the battering down of the old church, and flattened the nose of every statue then and there lying.\\"Historical Notes Relating to the Parish of Kempsey by the Rev.

It is the economic centre for the Bega Valley. Place name One claim is that place name Bega is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning \\"big camping ground\\". Another claim is that it is a corruption of the Aboriginal word \\"Bika\\" meaning \\"beautiful\\". History and description The Bega region was used by the Yuin-Monaro tribal grouping of Aborigines for thousands of years before Europeans arrived in the area. The first European to come near the area was George Bass, who explored the region's coastline in December 1797 as part of his broader explorations of the Australian coast. William Tarlinton was the first European to explore the area on foot, arriving in 1829. He returned in the early 1830s and settled there, starting a cattle farm. Others who arrived in the area around the same time were the Imlay brothers, who also began farming there. Their name has since been preserved in the form of Mount Imlay National Park. Live cattle were transported to Sydney for a time, to be supplemented by tallow and hides in the early 1840s. Beef and dairy farming were carried on in the area through the 1840s, and many towns were surveyed in the 1850s. The town of Bega itself was laid out and gazetted in December 1851. Located to the north of its present location, repeated flooding later resulted in its relocation to the higher ground south of the river. Dairy farming expanded in the region quickly throughout the 1860s, overtaking cattle farming as the predominant industry. In 1858, Tathra was used as a port for the transport of products to Sydney, and the Illawarra Steam Company was established. In 1861-62, Tathra Wharf was constructed, which allowed for the further growth and expansion of the dairy industry. The region received a further boost in the late 1870s when gold was discovered in the Bermagui area. The Bermagui gold rush followed quickly in 1880. Two years later, in 1882, the Municipality of Bega was created. The Bega Dairy Cooperative Limited was set up in the late 1890s. Bega is now well known for its cheese. Bega Cheese is manufactured by The Bega Co-operative Society Limited which is one of the larger Australian cheese companies. Their products are exported around the world and distributed across Australia and are available in most supermarkets and general stores. Notable local landmarks are Bega Court House and Rosevear Jeweller's shopfront, which are both listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/144 The court house was built in 1881 and consists of rendered brick and iron roofs. The Rosevear shop is in Carp Street and was established circa 1899. It is listed as a notable example of Victorian commercial designers. After years of planning, the shopping mall in Bega was built. The Sapphire Marketplace was opened on 2 December 2011.sapphiremarketplace.com.au  Heritage listings  Bega has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 21 Auckland Street: CBC Bank Building Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 4,141 people in Bega. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.3% of the population. * 83.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 2.4%. * 89.4% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were No Religion 33.0%, Anglican 23.1% and Catholic 20.5%.

LASRE was NASA's Linear Aerospike SR-71 Experiment which took place at the Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, California, until November 1998. The experiment sought to provide flight data to help Lockheed Martin validate and tune the computational predictive tools used to determine the aerodynamic performance of the Lockheed Martin X-33 lifting body and linear aerospike engine combination and to lay groundwork for a future reusable launch vehicle. LASRE was a small, half-span model of the X-33's lifting body with eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine, rotated 90 degrees and mounted on the back of a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird aircraft, to operate like a kind of \\"flying wind tunnel.\\" The experiment focused on determining how a reusable launch vehicle's engine plume would affect the aerodynamics of its lifting body shape at specific altitudes and speeds reaching about 750 miles/hour (335 meter/second or 1207 km/h). Design refinements looked to minimize the interaction of the aerodynamic flow with the engine plume, which could create drag. The aircraft completed seven research flights. Two initial flights were used to determine the aerodynamic characteristics of the LASRE apparatus on the back of the aircraft. The first of those occurred 31 October 1997. The SR-71 took off at 8:31 a.m. (Pacific Standard Time-PST). The aircraft flew for 1:50 hour, reaching Mach 1.2 and an altitude of 33,000 feet (10,000 m), landing at Edwards AFB. The result validated the SR-71/pod configuration. Five later flights focused on the experiment; two were used to cycle gaseous helium and liquid nitrogen through the experiment to check its plumbing system for leaks and to check engine operation characteristics. The first of these flights occurred 4 March 1998. The SR-71 took off at 10:16 a.m. PST. The aircraft flew for 1:57 hour, reaching Mach 1.58 before landing at Edwards AFB. During three more flights in the spring and summer of 1998, liquid oxygen was cycled through the engine. In addition, two engine hot firings were conducted on the ground. Researchers decided against a hot-fire flight test because of liquid oxygen leaks in the test apparatus. The ground firings and the airborne cryogenic gas flow tests provided enough information to predict the hot-gas effects of an aerospike engine firing during flight. LASRE Hardware The experiment itself was a small, half-span model of a lifting body shape. The model contained eight thrust cells of an aerospike engine and was mounted on a housing known as the \\"canoe,\\" which contained the gaseous hydrogen, helium, and instrumentation gear. The model, engine, and canoe together were called the \\"pod.\\" The entire pod was 41 feet in length and weighed 14,300 lb. The experimental pod was mounted on a NASA SR-71. Hardware and Aircraft Lockheed Martin may have used information gained from LASRE and the X-33 Advanced Technology Demonstrator to develop a potential future reusable launch vehicle. NASA and Lockheed Martin were partners in the X-33 program through a cooperative agreement. The goal of the X-33 program, and a major goal for NASA's Office of Aero-Space Technology, was to enable significant reductions in the cost of access to space, and to promote the creation and delivery of new space services and other activities that would improve U.S. economic competitiveness. The program implemented the National Space Transportation Policy, which is designed to accelerate the development of new launch technologies and concepts to contribute to the continuing commercialization of the national space launch industry. Both the X-33 and the smaller X-34 technology testbed demonstrator were under the Space Transportation Program Offices at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL. The air- launched, winged X-34 also was to demonstrate technologies applicable to future-generation reusable launch vehicles designed to dramatically lower the cost of access to space.

Affiliated to the Berks & Bucks Football Association, they are currently members of the and play at Culham Road. History The club was established as Abingdon Football Club in 1870. In 1892 they joined the Oxford & District League.Abingdon Town Non-League Club Directory After absorbing St Michaels in 1899, they went on to win back-to-back league titles in the next two seasons.History Abingdon Town F.C. After the second title the club joined the Berks & Bucks League, but left after a single season to join the West Berks League. In 1904 they changed leagues again, this time transferring to the Reading Temperance League. In 1919 Abingdon joined the North Berks League, going on to win the league title at the first attempt. After a second championship win in 1922‚Äì23 the club switched to the Reading & District League. In 1928 they became Abingdon Town. After a third-place finish in Division One in 1931‚Äì32 the club were promoted to the Premier Division. Although they finished bottom of the table in the next two seasons they were not relegated. They finished bottom again in 1936‚Äì37, after which they transferred into the Oxfordshire Senior League for a season (in which they also finished last), before returning to the North Berks League in 1938. Following World War II Abingdon Town rejoined the Reading & District League in 1945. They were runners-up in 1946‚Äì47 after losing a championship play-off to Thatcham Town. However, the following season saw the club win the league. In 1950 they moved up to the Spartan League, in which they played for three seasons before becoming founder members of the Hellenic League in 1953. When the league gained a second division in 1956 the club were placed in the Premier Division and went on to win the division in its first season. They were champions again in 1958‚Äì59, also winning the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup, and retained the league title the following season. After their back-to-back titles, Abingdon's success diminished and in 1965‚Äì66 the club finished bottom of the Premier Division and were relegated to Division One. The following season saw them finish as Division One runners-up, earning an immediate promotion back to the Premier Division. Although they went on to be runners-up in both 1970‚Äì71 and 1971‚Äì72, the club finished bottom of the division again in 1974‚Äì75, resulting in relegation back to Division One. However, another immediate return was achieved as they won Division One at the first attempt, losing only one league match all season. Abingdon Town were Premier Division champions for a fourth time in 1986‚Äì87, and after finishing second the following season, they returned to the Spartan League, joining its Premier Division. The club won the Spartan League at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division Two South of the Isthmian League. They were Division One South champions in 1990‚Äì91 and were promoted to Division One. After seven seasons in Division One the club were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. The following season they were relegated again, this time to Division Two. The club returned to Division Two when the league was restructured in 2002, although it was effectively a rename of Division Three. Despite a seventh-place finish in Division Two in 2004‚Äì05, Abingdon Town dropped into the Premier Division of the Hellenic League. The next nine seasons saw the club struggle, finishing outside the bottom four on only three occasions. In 2013‚Äì14 the club ended the season in last place in the Premier Division, subsequently dropping two divisions into Division One of the North Berks League. The club was inactive during the 2016‚Äì17 season, but returned to the Hellenic League for the 2017‚Äì18 season, joining Division Two East, which was largely composed of reserve teams. They moved up to Division One East prior to the 2018‚Äì19 season. Abingdon Town made headlines in December 2019 when, after conceding 8 goals in the first half of a league match against rivals Abingdon United, the team refused to play the second half and instead left the ground. Abingdon Town's manager Tranell Richardson resigned the following day, claiming the team had been unable to train for three months due to lack of facilities, and accusing the club's officials of not providing enough support.

Offenders are expected to work or study, and can access the prison's education and employment facilities. In the education centre, prisoners can study subjects from basic adult literacy and numeracy to a wide range of TAFE subjects and courses. A feature of the prison is a market garden which supplies a large proportion of fresh vegetables consumed in the State's prisons. It is the major employer of minimum-security prisoners and off-sets the cost of managing prisons in the State. The prison found itself in the news in 2005, when two minimum-security inmates escaped. Additionally sex offender Paul Stephen Keating held a female art tutor hostage for over six hours and during this time sexually assaulted her. Not long after these incidents, the State Government announced that Bunbury would be the first regional prison to have personal duress alarms for staff. In July 2005, then Justice Minister John D'Orazio announced a $9.6million upgrade of Bunbury Regional Prison to improve its security and to improve offender rehabilitation. In September 2008 a new Pre-Release Unit was opened to house minimum security prisoners, the size of this unit was 72 beds, now increased to 110 beds.

The Love Family began in 1968 as one small communal household on Queen Anne Hill, Seattle, and within the first ten years, it expanded to a network of communal homes and businesses. As more people arrived and settled in the surrounding neighborhood, Erdman, as the leader, continued to inherit land and homes (primarily from those who joined) in other, more rural areas of Washington state, Alaska, and Hawaii. Most of the property is no longer under the control of Erdman, having been sold or returned to the original owners via litigation. Sources differ on the Love Family's duration; some claim that after a fractious conflict in 1984, the community was reduced to a small fraction residing in suburban Bothell, Washington, while according to The Seattle Times and an article written by Serious Israel, the Love Family continued living on their property in Arlington, Washington. The Love Family flourished on that acreage from 1984 until 2004, when, according to the Seattle Times, some families moved to other, smaller properties. The Arlington commune supported both a local organic restaurant and an annual festival open to the public called the Garlic Festival, which drew healthy crowds to the property.  Spiritual foundations  \\"Love Israel\\" is a play on one of the fundamental affirmations of the group;, \\"Love is real\\". Equally important to the remaining members are three other commonly used affirmations: \\"We are one\\", \\"Love is the answer\\", and \\"Now is the time\\". These statements reflect three of the most widely experienced phrases of the 1960s and were the foundation stones of the earlier Love Family culture, even after the bulk of the group had moved on. These three 'fundamental belief' statements were often used to stave deeper curiosity and invoke a deeper discussion into the role of humanity on this earth. Remaining family members still maintain that they were called together to help each other cultivate love, oneness and the presence of God in everyday family life. Very little is spoken about the continuing belief that Love Israel is a leader directed through his vision from God. They also believe that their gathering has Biblical roots and that their purpose is to help fulfill directed prophecies to benefit man and the promises of Jesus. The current members still claim to view themselves as both the spiritual tribe of Israel and the Church of Jesus Christ at Armageddon, where Armageddon means the time and place of the gathering of God's family. A few family members continue to be renamed (and newborns named) to remind all that each person's character is gifted with a predominant attribute such as Charity, Honor, Honesty or Contentment, that may already be who they are or part of where they need to be.  History  The pioneers of the family came together gathered by vision and aggressive recruiting in Seattle's hippie community. Erdman was a salesman with a vision; charismatic and well spoken. Members came to hold him as better than themselves over time, working hard to make sure there was as seamless a hierarchy as possible. The small remaining core of Erdman's community continues to this day. In 1984, it was reported that membership dwindled from 500 to 40 as the group was forced to give back assets and money to disenchanted members. Notably, the Love Family returned to former member Daniel Gruener aka Richness Love $1.6 million and 14 Seattle properties. Current status The Love Family evolved from being a highly concentrated communal society with a shared economy, to what some non-members call a cult with their own laws and ways. The greater community in time became a social network of autonomous households that interact through a shared culture that they have continued to create together, without the robes and peer-enforced order. Presently, those that continue to claim membership in what remains of the Family are concentrated in homes and lots on the shore of the Columbia River (Lake Roosevelt), where they own the China Bend Winery, just south of Canada. In 2007, the former Arlington family grounds became Camp Kalsman, a Jewish summer camp. In January 2016, it was reported founding member Love Israel was battling stage 4 cancer, and on February 1 reportedly passed.http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/obituaries/cancer-kills-love- israel-founder-of-troubled-commune/ In film A film It Takes A Cult, about the Love Israel Family, director Eric Johannsen who grew up as part of it, was shown at the 2009 Seattle International Film Festival.It Takes A Cult at SIFF References  External links  Communalism Hippie movement Christian denominations founded in the United States Christian organizations established in 1968 Christian new religious movements History of Seattle Intentional communities in the United States ","title":"Love Family"},{"id":"1783905","text":"Albany Regional Prison is a maximum security prison located 8 km West of Albany, Western Australia.

Species of Stylonychia are very common in fresh water and soil, and may be found on filamentous algae, surface films, and among particles of sediment. Stylonychia can also be found swimming on and through decaying vegetation and pond scum floating through the water. Like its relatives, Stylonychia has cilia grouped into membranelles alongside the mouth and cirri over the body. It is distinguished partly by long cirri at the posterior, usually a cluster of three. The largest can just be seen at a 25x magnification, and the smallest can just be seen at a 450x magnification. Members of the group are carnivorous and prey on other protozoans and bacteria. Description Stylonychia mytilus, with cirri labeled Stylonychia mytilus, walking on its cirri Stylonychia cells are roughly oval in shape, inflexible and flattened from back to front. The organism's cilia are grouped into structures called \\"cirri,\\" tufts of joined cilia that function together as a unit.The cirri on the ventral surface of the cell can function as legs, enabling the organism to walk along solid substrates, such as submerged algae, leaves or debris. LIke other ciliates of the family Oxytrichidae, Stylonychia has a prominent group of eighteen large cirri on its ventral surface, arranged into six smaller groups: the frontal, buccal, frontoventral, postoral, pretransverse and transverse cirri. The region around the cell mouth (cytostome) is partially encircled by a series of compound cilia which make up the \\"adoral zone of membranelles\\", or AZM. This structure, which resembles the collar and lapel of a jacket, is used mainly to circulate water and brush particles of food into the organism's cell mouth. On the right side of the oral area are two \\"undulating membranes\\", delicate scarf-like structures made up of fused cilia. At the posterior of the cell are three long, stiff \\"caudal cirri\\", attached to the body at the lower margin of its dorsal surface.

Although the first comic in the series clearly draws on Joe Haldeman's Buying Time ( UK title: The Long Habit of Living), the plots of the following volumes continue beyond the end of the original novel. The plots of the continuation were written by Haldeman in English, translated into French by Marvano. The later volumes are written by Marvano alone, as Haldeman found him to do a good job. In the series the author challenges the reader to reflect on the issues at hand. Politics, philosophy and humanity's stupidity are often given a chance in this series. Over the years, the plot got more complicated and the characters came to their full potential, while at the same time its philosophical considerations deepened.

Mail order is the buying of goods or services by mail delivery. The buyer places an order for the desired products with the merchant through some remote method such as: * sending an order form in the postal mail * placing a telephone call, or * placing an order with a travelling agent and paying by instalments or * filling in a form on a website or mobile app ‚Äî if the product information is also mainly obtained online rather than via a paper catalogue or via television, this model is online shopping or e-commerce Then, the products are delivered to the customer. The products are usually delivered directly to an address supplied by the customer, such as a home address, but occasionally the orders are delivered to a nearby retail location for the customer to pick up. Some merchants also allow the goods to be shipped directly to a third party consumer, which is an effective way to send a gift to an out-of-town recipient. Some merchants delivered the goods directly to the customer via their travelling agents. A mail order catalogue is a publication containing a list of general merchandise from a company. Companies who publish and operate mail order catalogues are referred to as cataloguers within the industry. Cataloguers buy or manufacture goods then market those goods to prospects (prospective customers). Cataloguers may \\"rent\\" names from list brokers or cooperative databases. The catalogue itself is published in a similar fashion as any magazine publication and distributed through a variety of means, usually via a postal service and the internet. Sometimes supermarket products do mail order promotions, whereby people can send in the UPC plus shipping and handling to get a product made especially for the company. History =Early catalogues= In 1498, the publisher Aldus Manutius of Venice printed a catalogue of the books he was printing. In 1667, the English gardener William Lucas published a seed catalogue, which he mailed to his customers to inform them of his prices. Catalogues spread to British America, where Benjamin Franklin is believed to have been the first cataloguer. In 1744 he produced a catalogue of scientific and academic books. =First mail order= Page from the mail order catalogue of D Hay and Son, Nurserymen, 1899) The Welsh entrepreneur Pryce Pryce-Jones set up the first modern mail order in 1861.Pryce Pryce-Jones, Newtown businessman who introduced mail order shopping to the world BBC.co.uk Starting off as an apprentice to a local draper in Newtown, Wales, he took over the business in 1856 and renamed it the Royal Welsh Warehouse, selling local Welsh flannel. The establishment of the Uniform Penny Post in 1840, and the extension of the railway network, helped Pryce- Jones to eventually turn his small rural concern into a company with global renown. In 1861, Pryce-Jones hit upon a unique method of selling his wares. He distributed catalogues of his wares across the country, allowing people to choose the items they wished and order them via post; he would then dispatch the goods to the customer via the railways. It was an ideal way of meeting the needs of customers in isolated rural locations who were either too busy or unable to get into Newtown to shop directly. This was the world's first mail order business, an idea which would change the nature of retail in the coming century.Pryce Jones and the Royal Welsh Warehouse Powys - A day in the life The further expansion of the railways in the years that followed allowed Pryce Jones to greatly expand his customer base and his business grew rapidly. He supplied his products to an impressive variety of famous clientele, including Florence Nightingale and Queen Victoria, the Princess of Wales and royal households across Europe. He also began exporting drapery to the US and British colonies. One of his most popular products was the Euklisia Rug, the forerunner of the modern sleeping bag, which Pryce-Jones exported around the world, at one point landing a contract with the Russian Army for 60,000 rugs. By 1880, he had more than 100,000 customers and his success was rewarded in 1887 with a knighthood. =In North America= The cover of the first Eaton's catalogue, published in 1884. The Eaton's catalogue would continue to be published until 1976. In 1845, Tiffany's Blue Book was the first mail-order catalogue in the United States. In 1872, Aaron Montgomery Ward of Chicago produced a mail-order catalogue for his Montgomery Ward mail order business.Woodham (1997), 15 By buying goods and then reselling them directly to customers, Aaron Montgomery Ward was consequently removing the middlemen at the general store and to the benefit of the customer, lowering the prices drastically. His first catalogue was a single sheet of paper with a price list, 8 by 12 inches, showing the merchandise for sale and ordering instructions. Montgomery Ward identified a market of merchant-wary farmers in the Midwest. Within two decades, his single-page list of products grew into a 540-page illustrated book selling over 20,000 items. From about 1921 to 1931, Ward sold prefabricated kit houses, called Wardway Homes, by mail order. Hammacher Schlemmer is the earliest still surviving mail-order business, established by Alfred Hammacher in New York City in 1848. Offering mechanic's tools and builder's hardware, its first catalogue was published in 1881.About Hammacher Schlemmer from Hammacher Schlemmer's website T. Eaton Co. Limited was founded in 1869 in Toronto by Timothy Eaton, an Irish immigrant. The first Eaton's catalogue was a 34-page booklet issued in 1884. As Eaton's grew, so did the catalogue. By 1920, Eaton's operated mail order warehouses in Winnipeg, Toronto and Moncton to serve its catalogue customers. Catalogue order offices were also established throughout the country, with the first opening in Oakville in 1916. Sears Sears, Roebuck and Company catalogue, 1918 Richard Warren Sears started a business selling watches through mail order catalogues in Redwood Falls, Minnesota, in 1888. By 1894, the Sears catalogue had grown to 322 pages, featuring sewing machines, bicycles, sporting goods, automobiles (produced from 1905‚Äì1915 by Lincoln Motor Car Works of Chicago, not related to the current Ford Motor Company brand of the same name)Clymer, Floyd. Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877‚Äì1925. (New York: Bonanza, 1950), p.90. and a host of other new items. Organizing the company so it could handle orders on an economical and efficient basis, Chicago clothing manufacturer Julius Rosenwald became a part- owner in 1895. By the following year, dolls, refrigerators, stoves and groceries had been added to the catalog. Sears, Roebuck and Co. soon developed a reputation for high quality products and customer satisfaction. By 1895, the company was producing a 532-page catalogue with the largest variety of items that anybody at the time could have imagined. \\"In 1893, the sales topped 400,000 dollars. Two years later they exceeded 750,000 dollars.\\" In 1906 Sears opened its catalogue plant and the Sears Merchandise Building Tower.Book: Historic Sears, Roebuck and Co. Catalog Plant , opening date. And by that time, the Sears catalogue had become known in the industry as \\"the Consumers' Bible\\". In 1933, Sears, Roebuck and Co. produced the first of its famous Christmas catalogues known as the \\"Sears Wishbook\\", a catalogue featuring toys and gifts and separate from the annual Christmas catalogue. From 1908 to 1940, Sears also sold kit houses by mail order, selling 70,000 to 75,000 such homes, many of which are still lived in today. =Creation of an industry= The Outlook, American magazine advertisement from 1916 offering mail delivery of fish and seafood. By creating a direct marketing industry through the mail order catalogue, Pryce Pryce-Jones and Aaron Montgomery Ward enabled the creation of a powerful global network that came to include everything from mail order, to telemarketing and social media.Brandweek 50,no.36.D1-D4 \\"The Next Generation of DIRECT MARKETING.\\" Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, 2009,p.6. Mail order changed the worldwide marketplace by introducing the concept of privacy and individuality into the retail industry.Root, Damon. \\"Marketplace of Ideas.\\" Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, 2009, p.1. Today, the mail order catalogue industry is worth approximately 100 billion dollars and generates over 2 trillion in incremental sales. Moores Sir John Moores was a British businessman and philanthropist most famous for the founding of the Littlewoods retail company that was located in Liverpool, England. Moores became a millionaire through the creation of the Littlewood Pool, one of the best-known names in sports gambling in England. In January 1932, Moores was able to disengage himself sufficiently from the pools to start up Littlewoods Mail Order Store. This was followed on July 6, 1937 by the opening of the first Littlewoods department store in Blackpool. By the time World War II started there were 25 Littlewoods stores across the UK and over 50 by 1952. The first Littlewoods catalogue was published in May 1932 with 168 pages. The motto of the catalogue was, \\"We hoist our Flag in the Port of Supply, and right away we sail to the Ports of Demand‚Äîthe Homes of the People. We intend to help the homely folk of this country help them to obtain some of the profits made by manufacturing and trading... to save money on things they must have. This Catalogue is our Ship... staffed by an All-British crew... You won't find sleepy, old-fashioned goods carried in the LITTLEWOODS ship. Only the newest of the new goods‚Äîhonest, British-made merchandise.\\" With the success of the catalogue business, Moores moved his business four times to larger buildings in 1932. Moores sailed to America to look at the operations of Montgomery Ward and Sears and Roebuck. By 1936, the business had hit the 4 million pound mark, making Moores a millionaire a second time over, by mail order. Penney James Cash Penney started his first retail store in 1902 in Kemmerer, Wyoming. By 1925, J.C. Penney had 674 stores generating sales of $91 million. In 1962 J.C. Penney bought Wisconsin based General Merchandise Company with discount stores and a mail-order operation. Thus J.C. Penney entered the mail order catalogue business. J.C. Penney, a latecomer in catalogue operations, was different from many of its competitors because it had a large retail store base before launching into the mail-order business. The first J.C. Penney catalogue was mailed the next year in 1963. Customers could order from the catalogue inside J.C. Penney stores in eight states. The J.C. Penney Catalog Distribution Center was located in Milwaukee.

Gilbert's Nursery and Seed Trade Catalogue, Kentucky, 1902 Wunderman Mail order had always relied on the innovative technique of selling products directly to the consumer at appealing prices, but the term \\"direct marketing\\" was only coined in 1967, by Lester Wunderman ‚Äî considered to be the father of contemporary direct marketing. He was behind the creation of the toll-free 1-800 number and numerous mail order based loyalty marketing programs including the Columbia Record Club, the magazine subscription card, and the American Express Customer Rewards program. =Rise of e-commerce= With the invention of the Internet, a company's website became the more usual way to order merchandise for delivery by mail. Unless the retailer provides a paper catalogue from which to order, that is if the products are mainly presented to and searched for by the customer on a web site or mobile app, the term \\"mail order\\" is rarely used to describe the ordering of goods over the Internet. It is more usual to refer to this as e-commerce or online shopping. Online shopping allows more detailed information (including audio and video) to be presented, and allows for faster ordering than by mailed form (though phone orders are also common for mail-order catalogues). Most traditional mail order companies now also sell over the Internet, in some cases with a PDF or tablet application which allows shoppers to browse an electronic catalog that resembles a paper one very closely, though by the late 2010s this has become increasingly rare, and product information is presented in a format designed for the Web and mobile apps, rather than a PDF. Rising paper, printing, and postage costs have caused some traditional catalogue merchants, such as Bloomingdale's, to suspend their printed catalogues and sell only through websites. Also, while some Internet merchants are or were also catalogue merchants, many have never had a printed catalogue. = Catalogue publishing = Year Mail Order Catalogues were founded * Thonet brothers 1859 (GER) * Royal Welsh Warehouse 1861 (UK) * Montgomery Ward: 1872 (US) * Hammacher Schlemmer: 1881 (US; claims to be the longest-running catalogue in the U.S.) * Eaton's: 1884 (Canada) * Kastner & √ñhler: 1885 (Austria) * Sears: 1888 (US) * Universal Stores: 1900 (UK) * Freemans: 1905 (UK) * Spiegel Inc. 1905 (US) * Empire: 1907 (UK) * Grattan: 1912 (UK) * L.L.Bean: 1912 (US) * Eddie Bauer: 1920 (US) * La Redoute: 1922 (France) * Quelle: 1927 (Germany) * Littlewoods: 1932 (UK) * 3 Suisses: 1932 (FR) * Miles Kimball: 1935 (US) * Vermont Country Store: 1945 (US) * Walter Drake: 1947 (US) * Cohasset Colonials: 1949 (US) * Neckermann: 1950 (Germany) * Lillian Vernon: 1951 (US) * Taylor Gifts: 1952 (US) * Simpsons-Sears: 1953 (Canada) - a partnership of Sears with the pre- existing Simpson's chain * Otto: 1959 (Germany) * Lands' End: 1963 (US) * Potpourri Group: 1963 (US) * JC Penney: 1963 (US) * Carol Wright Gifts: 1972 (US) About Carol Wright Gifts * Dr Leonard's Healthcare Corp: 1980 (US) About Dr Leonards Healthcare Catalog * Next: 1988 (UK) * SkyMall: 1990 (US) * Scotts of Stow: 1992 (UK) * Basnett's: 2010 (US){https://www.ejbasnett.com/} Taxes The objective of the direct marketing industry is to alter the sales distribution chain, in other words [bypass] the wholesaler and the retailer and go directly to the customer, reducing therefore tariffs and taxes.Journal of Business & Finance Librarianship 9, no. 4: 221-236. \\"Direct Marketing and E-Commerce Sources.\\" Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, 2004,p.2 In the United States, an advantage of this type of shopping is that the merchant is typically not required by law to add sales tax to the price of the goods, unless they have a physical presence in the customer's state. Instead, most states require the resident purchaser to pay applicable taxes. There has been periodic discussion about amending the law to make these sales taxable, especially with the rise of online shopping (see e.g. Amazon tax). In the European Union, a \\"VAT union\\" is in force: the merchant selling to a buyer in a different EU member country adds the VAT of his own country to the price, and the buyer pays no additional tax. A buyer for resale may deduct that VAT, just as with purchases made within his own country. This makes the EU look more like one country than the U.S. in this respect.

Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) is a 5-minute drive away from Taman Universiti, hence the name of the town. The town is dominated by civil servants (lecturers, office workers) and students from UTM. The university alone has 30,000 students who mostly live on campus but visit the town to shop.  Naming of area and roads  The town is divided into 10 areas; Pertanian (meaning agriculture), Penyiaran (broadcasting), Perubatan (medical), Perdagangan (trade), Kebangsaan (national), Kejayaan (success), Kebudayaan (culture), Kemajuan (progress), Kemuliaan (honour), and Pendidikan (education). The word Jalan (street) is added in front of the area name and a number is added after the area name to complete the road system. For example, Jalan Kebangsaan 23. It was named so that all the areas that begin with the letter P are on the West side of the Jalan Pendidikan that is the main road running through Taman Universiti and areas that begin with the letter K on the east side of Jalan Pendidikan.

The site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. It was initially used for convicts transported from Britain, but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. Royal Commissions were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in a 1988 riot with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security Casuarina Prison. The prison was administered by a comptroller general, sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented. Prison life at Fremantle was extremely regulated. Meals were an important part of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with flogging and time in irons eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe, as well as John Boyle O'Reilly and six other Fenians in the 19th century, and Brenden Abbott in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988. Since 1991, Fremantle Prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken. New uses have been found for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing as part of the Australian Convict Sites submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (18501886), at the expense of its more recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.  Architecture  = Layout = Fremantle Prison was built on a land grant of about from limestone quarried on-site. A tall boundary wall encloses the prison grounds, with a gatehouse in the centre of the western wall, facing The Terrace. Other roads bounding the site are Knutsford Street to the north, Hampton Road to the east, and Fothergill Street to the south. Cottages, which housed prison workers and officials, are located outside the wall either side of the gatehouse. Inside the walls, the parade ground is located east of the gatehouse. Beyond it is the Main Cell Block at the centre of the site, which contains two chapels. North of the main block is New Division, and west of that, in the north-western corner, is the former Women's Prison, previously the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry. The hospital building stands in the north-eastern corner, while the former workshops are located in the south-eastern corner, as well as to the north of the gatehouse. A system of tunnels, constructed to provide fresh water from an aquifer, runs under the eastern edge of the site. = Buildings =  Houses on The Terrace  North of the gatehouse, located at 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in Victorian style, in contrast to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located on the north side of the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.  Gatehouse  The gatehouse and associated entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It was designed by Royal Engineer and Comptroller General Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers either side of a narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was used to make the gate, while the clock at the top of the structure was imported from England. As the main entrance, the gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a caf√© and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.  Main Cell Block  A re-creation of typical 1855 cell accommodation Little-changed since its construction in the 1850s by convicts, the Main Cell Block was designed to hold up to 1000 prisoners. The central, four-storey high cell block is flanked on either end by large dormitory wards, called the Association Rooms. Here, as many as 80 men slept in hammocks, either as a reward for good behaviour or because they would soon receive their ticket of leave. In contrast, the cramped cells measured just . Although each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of S-bends; the smells coming up the pipes led to their removal by the 1860s. Following a Royal Commission, the cells were enlarged by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets ‚Äì buckets were used for the duration of the prison's operation. Since the prison's closure, six cells have been restored to represent the varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The main block also houses the gallows, solitary confinement cells, and two chapels ‚Äì Anglican and Catholic.  New Division  Fremantle Prison's New Division building was constructed between 1904 and 1907, as a response to overcrowding. It also allowed prison administrators to implement the \\"separate system\\", whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. A panopticon in the exercise yard was initially used to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading to its removal within five years. New Division was the first building to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War II, the Australian Army appropriated the division, to keep their prisoners separate from the main population. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms.  Women's Prison  The north- western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of Perth Gaol and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The construction of Bandyup Women's Prison saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970, with the space used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991.  Hospital  Built between 1857 and 1859, the hospital was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.  Workshops  The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built at the start of the twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop. In 1993 the four northern workshops were adapted for use as TAFE art workshops. = Tunnels = View inside the tunnels In the 1850s, shafts were sunk into the limestone bedrock to provide the prison with fresh water from an aquifer, and a tank was installed in 1874 to offer the town of Fremantle an alternative water supply. Prisoners worked a pump to fill the tank, which was connected to the jetties through gravity-fed pipes. In 1896, a town reservoir was constructed on Swanbourne Street, fed from the prison by a triple-expansion steam-driven pump that could take more than per day from the prison tunnels. Prisoners, relieved of manual pumping, were employed to supply wood and stoke boilers. The tunnels were closed in 1910, though the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, diesel leaking from nearby tanks was found to have contaminated the water; however, the pollution was largely cleared by 1996 through bioremediation. The tunnels were opened to tourists in mid-2005.  History  = 19th century = While the Swan River Colony was established as a \\"free settlement\\" (unlike the penal colonies on the east coast), by the 1840s demand for cheap labour overcame an early reluctance, and the colony agreed to accept some convicts from Britain. The arrival of the first convict ship Scindian on 2 June 1850 was unexpected, as a sailing ship that had been sent ahead had been blown off-course. The colony's Round House jail was full, so the 75 convicts had to be left on the ship until a temporary prison was built. Comptroller General of Convicts Edward Henderson looked for a place to build a permanent convict establishment, and ultimately settled on the current site, on a hill overlooking Fremantle. Main Cell Block internal arrangement watercolour of the Main Cell Block, by Henry Wray The design for Fremantle Prison was based on the Pentonville Prison in Britain, but with diagonal cell blocks replaced with a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. The first priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging. The prison walls were constructed between 1853 and 1855, while the gatehouse and associated entry complex was built in 1854 and 1855. Construction of the southern half of the Main Cell Block began in 1853 and was finished in 1855, with prisoners transferred from the temporary prison on 1 June 1855. Construction of the northern wing followed. The Crimean War saw the Royal Engineers recalled, leaving only one of their number, Henry Wray, to oversee the building's construction, which was completed by the end of 1859. During Western Australia's convict era, the prison was known as the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government. In 1868, penal transportation to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the colonial government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex ‚Äì demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886. Once the prison came under the control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were transferred to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there, in their own separate section. The Western Australian gold rushes of the 1890s resulted in strong economic growth, and a massive increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and to 184,000 by 1901. This influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded. The 1890s also saw a growing public unease with the treatment of prisoners. In September 1898 a Royal Commission was established by the Governor of Western Australia to investigate the colony's penal system. The commission heard evidence from almost 240 witnesses, including a range of prisoners. Three reports were made between December 1898 and June 1899, dealing with the most recognisable and prominent issues including classification, sentencing, punishments, and diet. In particular, they considered the philosophy of the prison system ‚Äì the causes of crime, as well as the types of punishments and their justifications ‚Äì and in light of this, the practicality of various reform proposals. = Early 20th century = Three Division for \\"long sentenced and habitual prisoners\\" Within a year of the enquiry, almost 100 cells had been enlarged by knocking down the inner wall between two cells, and a classification system was introduced. Internal walls were constructed in the main block, creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces were designed for tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters. New regulations for prison officers were published in the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document. New Division, completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908, resulted from the 1899 Commissioners' report recommending a modified version of the separate system. The new division was similar in design to Henderson's 1850s structure, but was constructed in an L-shape, was only three stories tall, and had electric lighting. It also differed in its use from the main cell block. Unlike occupants of the earlier building, prisoners remained continuously in their cells except when exercising in separate yards, watched panopticon-style by a warder in a central tower. In 1911 another Royal Commission investigation into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was ignored by the state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with the appointment of a superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a Labor government with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912. Fremantle Prison was partially used as a military prison during both world wars ‚Äì for the detention of military personnel, as well as an internment centre. From 1940 until 1946, it was one of more than 50 military prisons across Australia holding a combined total of more than 12,000 enemy aliens and prisoners of war. Fremantle accommodated up to 400 military prisoners and up to 160 civilian prisoners by October 1945. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942. = 20th century reform = Prison outstations were established as part of the reforms in the 20th century, and to reduce the overcrowding at Fremantle. Pardelup Prison Farm opened in 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though planned to be a temporary measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Significant reform to Western Australia's prison system did not begin until the 1960s, lagging behind those which occurred elsewhere in Australia and the world after World War II. Seven new prisons were opened between 1960 and 1971, and in 1970, female prisoners and staff were moved from Fremantle to the new Bandyup Women's Prison. New legislation regarding probation, parole, and convicted drunkards was also introduced, which provided alternatives to imprisonment. With these new arrangements, and more variety in prisons and prison types, a classification board was set up in 1963 to assess prisoners. The appointment of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One of his first changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, as well as an assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department. In 1972 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate mistreatment of and discrimination against Aboriginal prisoners. Its 1973 report found that there was not \\"any appreciable discrimination\\", however, racial stereotypes are present throughout the report, and the testimony of Aboriginal prisoners was considered unreliable. The report also made recommendations regarding various aspects of prison life, including additional, independent, trained welfare officers. William Kidston succeeded Campbell in 1977, and oversaw a shift in policy from \\"paternalistic rehabilitation\\" of prisoners to merely providing opportunities for rehabilitation. A new Prisons Act was passed in 1981, which updated the 1903 Act with modern philosophies and practices. This act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, and the department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility. Ian Hill became Director of the Prisons Department in 1983, and reorganised the department several times, striving for increased efficiency. Whilst the changes of the 1980s were effective throughout most of Western Australia's prison system, the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent eventually culminated in the 1988 prison riot, investigated by an official enquiry later that year. = Closure and subsequent use = The state government made the decision to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future, whether it should be preserved or redeveloped. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community. The Fremantle Prison Trust was established in 1992 to advise the Minister for Works on the management of the site. Various new uses were found for different parts of the prison, including wedding services in the chapels, the Coastal Business Centre in New Division, and the Fremantle Children's Literature Centre in the hospital; the prison also became a tourist attraction. A private company, the Fremantle Prison Guardians, organised the tourist operation for ten years under contract, until the end of 2001; subsequently, the state government took control. A hostel providing short-stay accommodation in the Women's Prison opened in May 2015.  Staff and prisoners  = Administration = Comptroller General Edmund Henderson Western Australia's first comptroller general of convicts, Edmund Henderson, administered the convict establishment for thirteen years. The primary responsibilities of the comptroller general were to \\"direct convict labour and be responsible for convict discipline\\". With the transfer of Fremantle Prison to the colonial government in 1886, the role of the comptroller was replaced by that of the sheriff, responsible for all of the prisons in the colony. The position of comptroller general was recreated, with duties split off from the sheriff's office, in early 1911. In 1971, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department. While the comptroller, sheriff, or director was responsible for the overall convict or prison system, largely centred around Fremantle Prison, the responsibility of the prison itself lay with the superintendent. = Officers = On convict ships, the convicts were guarded by pensioner guards, who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service in areas such as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them. The pensioner guards were expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison. Fremantle Prison's officers were known as warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built terrace houses within walking distance of the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve- hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship. The prison officer's role in the 20th century did not change much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer training became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers' Union. The strength of the union was based on the ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975. = Prisoners = Prisoners in front of Main Cell Block, Convicts were introduced into Western Australia for three main purposes: inexpensive labour, additional labour, and an injection of British government spending into the local economy. During the initial years of transportation, convicts were generally young, from a rural background, and of good character, having only committed minor offences ‚Äì potential future colonists, after their sentence had been served. By the 1860s the majority were older, more serious offenders from urban areas, including political prisoners considered to be \\"difficult and dangerous\\". Following the transfer of Fremantle Prison to local control in 1886, it became Western Australia's primary prison. In the late 1880s and 1890s the number of inmates swelled dramatically. This increase predominantly comprised prisoners serving shorter sentences of under three months. The number of inmates in 1897 was 379, and Inspector of Prisons James Roe viewed the prison as \\"inconveniently full\\". Despite a large expansion of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative to the rest of Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.  Prison operation  Daily routine in 1991 = Routine = In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the day began with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the officers and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm. The transfer of the Convict Establishment to the colonially-run Fremantle Prison saw little change, and no new regulations. A similar routine, but with fewer working hours, is described in the 1930s: Not much had changed by the 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45 am. After a prisoner count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast and headed back to their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20 pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30 pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners. = Diet = Prisoners ate meals in their cells, from the early years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was included in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables. By the 1890s food was still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general standard of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs. In the 1960s, food preparation was overseen by a qualified chef, who also trained prisoners. The diet consisted of quality food, but \\"without trimmings\\". Breakfast was porridge, with a third of a pint of milk, a hot drink (tea, unless the prisoner bought coffee or cocoa), and either Vegemite, honey, or margarine, depending on the week. Lunch and dinner had more variation. Both meals consisted of a meat dish ‚Äì corned beef, sausages, or mince pie ‚Äì as well as mashed potato and cabbage, although there was occasionally a roast dinner. Meat, vegetables and bread were still a prominent part of the diet in 1991. = Labour = As well as being used to build the prison itself, convict labour, with convicts in chain gangs, was used for other public works in the Fremantle and surrounding Perth area, including The Causeway, Perth Town Hall and Stirling Highway. The work undertaken by a convict depended on their behaviour and demeanour. Upon arrival to Western Australia, convicts were kept within the prison for a period of observation. If found to have a reasonable disposition, the convict would be sent to work, in a gang under the control of a warder. Typical activities included \\"quarrying, filling swamps, burning lime, constructing public buildings, roads and jetties\\" around Fremantle and Perth. After some time, they might be sent to work on road or other projects away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted at the end of a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re- offenders and captured escapees, after corporal punishment and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle. Outside work, mostly on public infrastructure, continued beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, the rise of trade unions that saw such work as \\"a threat to free labour\\", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 outside work had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work ‚Äì increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century ‚Äì so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and oakum picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed at the pump, each doing only a few minutes work per hour, and occupied the rest of the time with recreation such as draughts. New workshops built in 1901 allowed prisoners to work in bootmaking and tailoring, and from 1904, printing. Only a small fraction of prisoners were allocated to the workshops ‚Äì 35 out of an average of 279 prisoners in 1902. In 1908, there were still few men employed in the workshops, 20 in tailoring, 15 in bootmaking, and 12 in mat making, with only half of these working at a time, and little improvement by the 1911 Royal Commission. The 20th century saw little change in the work prisoners did. There were similar workshops, with the addition of metal work, and similar jobs around the prison complex, including in the laundry, in the kitchen, and cleaning the prison. In 1984, 90% of prisoners were reported to be employed, either full-time or part-time. The meaningfulness of the work was nominal, as work was viewed as \\"a management option rather than [for] production\\", but security concerns and discipline restricted the rehabilitative value of the work, and limited much of the work to jobs non- existent outside of prison. = Punishments = Post prisoners were tied to when flogged In the convict era, particularly during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with flogging, solitary confinement, and working in chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings ‚Äì in 1851, out of a total of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings. By the 1880s, punishments also included a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in irons, and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate. The cat o' nine tails, which had been used since the early days of the prison, was abolished during the post-1911 Royal Commission reforms. Other reforms in this period saw the number of punishments inflicted decrease from 184 in 1913 to 57 in 1914, and 35 in 1915. Flogging was discontinued in the 1940s, with the last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period. = Executions = The gallows, last used in 1964 As soon as Fremantle Prison came under local control in 1886, a refractory block with gallows was planned. It was completed in 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of execution in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. Martha Rendell was the only woman to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer Eric Edgar Cooke, executed in 1964. The execution process followed a strict procedure. From the day of sentencing to death, prisoners were kept in a concrete-floored cell in New Division. They were vigilantly observed to prevent them escaping their sentence through suicide. With hangings taking place on Monday mornings, at 8:00 am, condemned prisoners were woken three hours earlier, and provided with a last meal, shower, and clean clothes. Afterwards, handcuffed, they were moved to a holding or \\"condemned cell\\" nearby the gallows, and allowed a couple of sips of brandy to calm their nerves. Shortly before 8:00 am, they were hooded, led up to the execution chamber, which could hold as many as eleven witnesses, stood over the trap door, had a noose put around their neck, and were hanged by dropping through the opening trap door. The time between from leaving the cell and the execution itself was quite short, approximately 60 seconds. Following a medical examination, the deceased was removed for burial. = Escapes = There were a multitude of attempted escapes from Fremantle Prison. Prominent escapees included Moondyne Joe in 1867, John Boyle O'Reilly in 1869 and six other Fenians in 1876, and Brenden Abbott in 1989.  Moondyne Joe  Moondyne Joe's \\"escape-proof\\" cell Joseph Bolitho Johns, better known as Moondyne Joe, was Western Australia's best known bushranger. In July 1865, Johns was sentenced to ten years penal servitude for killing a steer. He and another prisoner absconded from a work party in early November, and were on the run for nearly a month, during which time Johns adopted the nickname Moondyne Joe. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Moondyne Joe was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to Fremantle Prison. In July 1866 he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door, but in August Moondyne Joe succeeded in escaping again. Moondyne Joe formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to South Australia, but was captured on 29 September about north-east of Perth. As punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Moondyne Joe received five years hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that he did not escape again. He was transferred to Fremantle Prison where a special \\"escape-proof\\" cell was made for him, built from stone, lined with jarrah sleepers and over 1000 nails. In early 1867 Moondyne Joe was set to work breaking stone, but rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Moondyne Joe worked under the constant supervision of a warder. Governor John Hampton was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Moondyne Joe: \\"If you get out again, I'll forgive you\\". However, the rock broken by Moondyne Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison. On 7 March 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. A few days before the second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe was recaptured, returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional four years in irons. Eventually, Governor Frederick Weld heard of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.  The Fenians  Fenians escape by whaleboat to Catalpa From 1865 to 1867, British authorities rounded up supporters of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, or Fenians, an Irish independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship Gazelle and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system. The Fenians in America bought the whaling ship Catalpa, which on 29 April 1875 sailed from New Bedford, Massachusetts on a secret rescue mission. Coordinating with local Fenian agents, the escape was arranged for 17 April 1876, when most of the Convict Establishment garrison would be watching the Royal Perth Yacht Club regatta. Catalpa dropped anchor in international waters off Rockingham and dispatched a whaleboat to the shore. At 8.30 am, six Fenians who were working in work parties outside the prison walls absconded, and were met by carriages that raced south to where the boat was waiting. The whaleboat managed to rendezvous with Catalpa the following day, which then headed out to sea. They were chased by the steamship SS Georgette, which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though Georgette caught up with the whaler on 19 April, Catalpa master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on Catalpa would be considered an act of war against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, Georgette allowed Catalpa to flee.  Brenden Abbott  Brenden Abbott, \\"the Postcard Bandit\\", escaped from Fremantle Prison in 1989. He had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for \\"Australia's first 'drop in'-style bank robbery\\" at the Belmont branch of the Commonwealth Bank. While working in the prison's tailor shop, he was able to stitch together overalls resembling those worn by the guards. Abbott and two accomplices took the opportunity to escape, wearing the overalls, when left unsupervised in the workshop. They cut through a bar and got onto the roof. One accomplice fell and broke his leg, but Abbott and the other managed to jump over to the wall, and thus escape. Abbott avoided capture until 1995, committing various robberies as he moved across Australia. He also escaped from a Queensland prison after two years and returned to Western Australia, allegedly robbing the Commonwealth Bank's Mirrabooka branch. Abbott was recaptured in Darwin, six months after his escape, and was sent to a Queensland maximum-security prison with a twenty year sentence to serve. = Riots = There have been various prisoner riots and other disturbances at Fremantle Prison over the years that it was operational. One of the earliest was in 1854, while major riots which occurred in 1968 and 1988 resulted in damage to the prison.  1968  A riot occurred on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing to go back to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens. After approximately three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, with the last of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, Karnet, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the state government, which did not consider prison reform a priority.  1988  On 4 January 1988, despite the heat, officers decided prisoners should remain outside in the exercise yards in the afternoon. As division 3 prisoners were let inside at around 4 pm, a voice exclaimed \\"Let's take 'em\\", and simultaneously, guards were splashed with boiling water, usually used for making tea. A horde of prisoners stormed the cellblock, attacking the guards with whatever makeshift weapons they could find. This resulted in pandemonium; prisoners rushed along landings, overpowering officers and taking them hostage, while at the same time, other prisoners darted between cells, starting fires. The prisoners withdrew to the exercise yard, taking six hostages, as flames quickly overran the building, spread into the rafters, and caused the roof to collapse. Police negotiators communicated with the ring leaders, and by nightfall only five hostages remained. Meanwhile, the fire brigade had trouble bringing the inferno in the main cell block under control, as the prison's gate was too narrow for their trucks, and prisoners impeded their endeavours by throwing debris at them. The prisoners' leaders made three demands: a meeting with Attorney General Joe Berinson, access to the media, and a guarantee of no retribution afterwards. The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met. Prisoners did, however, have an opportunity to communicate with the press during the siege, as the riot was a live media event with television helicopters filming from overhead. Although there were no deaths, the fire caused $1.8 million of damage, and officers were injured. In the aftermath of the riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks. A trial involving thirty-three prisoners charged over the riot was also held, the largest in the state's history, which resulted in lengthened sentences for the prisoners.  Conservation  thumb The newly restored prison gatehouse in 2005 = Heritage listing = Fremantle Prison was listed in the Western Australian Register of Historic Places as an interim entry on 10 January 1992 and included as a permanent entry on 30 June 1995. Described as the best preserved convict-built prison in the country, it became the first building in Western Australia to be listed on the Australian National Heritage List, in 2005. The Australian Federal Heritage Minister, Senator Ian Campbell, stated that it would be included in a nomination of eleven convict areas to become World Heritage Sites. Five years later, these locations were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2010 as the Australian Convict Sites. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era. This came at the expense of its more recent history, included use as an internment centre during World War II, and the imprisonment of Aboriginal prisoners. The prioritisation, evident from the first conservation plans from before the prison closed, is reflected in the branding of the tourist experience as \\"Fremantle Prison ‚Äì the Convict Establishment\\", and through restorations that, while necessary to prevent damage and deterioration, strip away the site's recent history. = Restoration = Various parts of Fremantle Prison have had restoration works undertaken since the 1990s; a total of $800,000 was spent between 1996/97 and 1998/99 on works which included restoring the facade of the Anglican chapel. In 2005, work was undertaken on the restoration of the prison gatehouse area. Non-original rendering was removed and the original stonework was revealed. Work was also completed on the tunnels during 2005/06, and the main cell block was restored with an eighteen month, $1.9 million project in 2006 and 2007. The gallows room was restored in 2013 to conditions at the time of the last execution, in 1964.  Tourism  Fremantle Prison receives international and domestic tourists, as well as ex-prisoners, former prison officers, and their descendants. Tourist numbers increased each year from 2001/02 to 2009/10, up from almost 105,000 to nearly 180,000 over that period. , the prison has won, been a finalist in, or received other commendation at tourism or heritage awards each year since 2006. While the tourist experience is based on authenticity and heritage values, some details are concealed or de-emphasised, such as prison tattooing, riots, and graffiti portraying revenge, sexuality, or brutality. Attractions include guided tours, a visitors' centre with searchable convict database, art gallery, caf√©, gift shop, and tourist accommodation. Educational activities are regularly held for school children, as are exhibitions and re-enactments of historical events. Functions such as theme parties and dinners are held in the prison, with re-enactments serving as entertainment. Tours of the prison show aspects of prison life and recount successful and attempted escapes. Sections of the tunnels are accessible, and night tours focus on the prison's reputation for being haunted. Drawing found in James Walsh's cell The Fremantle Prison Collection contains around 15,000 items associated with the prison's site, history, or the experiences of its workers and prisoners. It is also involved in preserving oral histories, with interview transcripts stored at Fremantle Prison and recordings archived in the Battye Library Oral History Collection. Recollections have been recorded since 1989, and include the experiences of authorities, staff, volunteer visitors, and prisoners. The Fremantle Prison records and collections, including archaeological, provide a substantial resource for researchers. The Prison Gallery showcases and offers for sale the artworks of current and ex- prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other exhibits related to the history of the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century forger James Walsh, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. Painting or drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though graffiti, which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases ‚Äì including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells ‚Äì but only for work considered art and not graffiti. Art, or art therapy, was not officially permitted until the 1980s; graffiti was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced. A more contemporary prison artist was Dennis (NOZ) Nozworthy, who stated that he found art on death row, in 1982. Some of his work currently is held in the collections of Curtin University, Perth Central TAFE, and the WA Government, Department of Justice. Other cells contain Aboriginal artwork, many by unknown artists. The Walmajarri artist Jimmy Pike started painting in Fremantle prison, having received tuition from Steve Culley and David Wroth.

He was the commander of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in Baler which fought in the Siege of Baler in the Philippines. Early years Zayas was born and raised in San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. His father, born in Barcelona, Spain, was an officer in the Spanish Army stationed in the island. Zayas received the best education available as the son of a military official. His main interest was photography and he became a professional photographer at a young age. On November 1888, when he was 19 years old, Zayas joined the Spanish Army in San Juan.Juan Alonso Zayas: Un h√©roe puertorrique√±o desconocido Military career He was first assigned to the Infantry Regiment of Luchana N 28. In May 1889, Zayas was sent to Cuba and assigned to the Battalion of Isabel II and later to the Infantry Regiment of Cuba. Zayas was promoted to the rank of Sergeant and sent to the School of Sergeants of the Getafe Civil Guard in Madrid, Spain, before the outbreak of the Cuban Revolt of 1895. By 1897, Zayas was already a Second Lieutenant, when he received orders to head for the Philippines as commander of the 2nd Expeditionary Battalion stationed in Baler. He arrived in Manila, the capital of the Philippines in May 1897. In Manila, he took a vessel and headed for Baler which is located on the island of Luzon. Siege of Baler Baler (San Luis Obispo de Tolosa) church. The distance between Manila and Baler is 62 miles (100 km) and if traveled through the jungles and badly built roads, the actual distance would be 144 miles (230 km). At that time, a system of communication between Manila and Baler was almost non-existent. The only way Baler received news from Manila was by way of sea vessels. The Spanish Colonial Government was under constant attack from the local Filipino groups who wanted their independence from the Spanish Crown. Zayas mission was to fortify Baler against any possible attack. Among his plans for the defense of Baler was to convert the local church of San Luis de Tolosa into a fort. The independence advocates, under the leadership of Col. Calixto Vilacorte, were called \\"insurgents\\" or \\"Tagalos\\" by the Spanish Crown. On June 28, 1898, they demanded the surrender of the Spanish Army. The Spanish political governor of the region, Enrique de las Morena y Fossi refused. Immediately, the Filipinos attacked Baler in a battle that was to last for seven months. Despite being outnumbered, hunger and disease, the Battalion did not give up.LOS ULTIMOS DE FILIPINAS In the meantime, Zayas and the rest of the Battalion were totally unaware of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War that was going on. In August 1898, the hostilities between the United States and Spain came to an end. The Philippines became a U.S. possession under the accordance of the Treaty of Paris. Spanish surrender In May 1899, the Battalion at Baler found out about the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and its aftermath. They had been unaware that they had been fighting for a possession which was no longer theirs to fight for. On June 2, 1899 the Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Mart√≠n Cerezo surrendered to the Tagalos only after some conditions were met. Among the conditions were the following: # That the Spaniards not be treated as prisoners of war and # that they would not be harmed in their quest of reaching a Spanish ship which would take them back to Spain. The 32 survivors of Zayas Battalion were sent to Manila where they boarded a ship headed for their homeland. In Spain, they were given a heroes welcome and became known as \\"Los √öltimos de Filipinas\\" (The Last of the Philippines) and also as \\"Los √öltimos de Baler\\" (The Last of Baler). 2nd Lt. Juan Alonso Zayas was not among the survivors. He died, on October 8, 1898, from beriberi and with several other members of his unit was buried in San Luis de Tolosa, the church of Baler.

He is a founding member and the frontman of Floridian rock band New Found Glory, for whom he sings lead vocals and contributes lyrics. He was also the guitarist in the band's now defunct side-project, the International Superheroes of Hardcore, where he performed under the pseudonym of \\"Chugga Chugga\\". Biography Jordan Pundik was born in Englewood, New Jersey, to Carlos and Maureen Pundik. His family moved to Pompano Beach, Florida, when he was 3 years old. He has a brother named Daniel and a sister named Edra. He learned how to play guitar when he was 15 years old. Musical career The origins of the band New Found Glory date back to the summer of 1997 when Pundik met Steve Klein at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the pair began writing music together. Pundik later stated the band name was created whilst he and Klein were working in Red Lobster together. Pundik says, \\"We came up with A New Found Glory, we wrote it on a napkin. I think we pulled some of it from \\"A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts\\" by the Get Up Kids\\". They recruited friend Ian Grushka on bass, who they had previously played with in a band named \\"Inner City Kids\\". The band practiced in Grushka's garage, and later invited Joe \\"Taco Joe\\" Marino to play drums. Shortly thereafter, Chad Gilbert (lead guitar), former vocalist of Shai Hulud, joined to complete the quintet. In addition to his work with New Found Glory, Pundik has also collaborated with many artists. His vocals also appear on the tracks \\"Kings of Hollywood\\" and \\"You're Not Alone\\" on MxPx's 2003 release Before Everything & After.

It was released in December 1967. The recording included group members Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood, Chris Wood, and Dave Mason; however, Mason left the band shortly after the album was released. The album reached the number 16 position in the UK albums chart,Chart Stats and number 88 on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. Overview The album was recorded at Olympic Studios in London with American record producer Jimmy Miller and recording engineer Phill Brown. When Brown was asked his favourite memory of engineering, he responded: \\"Recording Dear Mr Fantasy, one o'clock in the morning, November 1967.\\"McGee, Alan (9 April 2008). Wherefore Art Thou Mark Hollis?, Guardian.co.uk. The UK release was one of the earliest albums on the Island Records label. This edition had a color gatefold cover and included 10 songs. In keeping with common practice in the 1960s, the original UK album left out hit songs from early Traffic singles. The sitar, an instrument widely associated with this era of Traffic due to its use on the singles \\"Paper Sun\\" and \\"Hole in My Shoe\\", is used on only one track on the UK album, \\"Utterly Simple\\". United States version The first US version was released in early 1968 by United Artists Records and re-titled Heaven Is in Your Mind. It featured a different, non-gatefold cover showing three members of the group without Mason. For this edition, a short looping snippet of the single \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" was added between most of the songs. The US LP was re-sequenced and also added three other singles (\\"Paper Sun\\", \\"Hole in My Shoe\\", and \\"Smiling Phases\\") but deleted two Mason songs (\\"Hope I Never Find Me There\\" and \\"Utterly Simple\\".) The final track on the US album, \\"We're A Fade, You Missed This\\", is actually the ending of the full length \\"Paper Sun\\". After the first pressing the title of the US album was quickly changed back to Mr. Fantasy, but the new cover and track list remained until United Artists went out of business and Island reissued the UK stereo version in the United States in 1980. This edition was also released as Mr. Fantasy in Australia and New Zealand by Festival Records. The first Canadian edition was based on the US album, but dropped two songs. This was released in a unique cover with the title Reaping but replaced by the UK stereo album in 1970. Different mixes and recordings Both UK and US albums were released in significantly different stereo and mono mixes. These differences led to four distinct variations of the album. All of these have been re-issued on CD. The 1999 UK re-issue features the UK version in stereo and the US album in mono. In 2000 the US stereo version was re-issued on CD with its original title Heaven Is in Your Mind plus stereo bonus tracks. The same year the UK mono version was also released in the US as Mr. Fantasy with mono bonus tracks. The song \\"Giving to You\\", was released in 3 different versions. The first was a mono B-side with lyrics in the introduction sung by Winwood. This also appeared on the US mono LP. The mono and stereo UK albums had a revised version, which was included on the US stereo album. The soundtrack album for Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush also contains a different recording of \\"Utterly Simple\\" than the one used on this album. \\"Coloured Rain\\" was recorded as \\"Colored Rain\\" by Eric Burdon & The New Animals featuring a guitar solo by Andy Summers.Andy Summers, One Train Later, Thomas Dunne Books, 2006. . It was also recorded by The Hassles, Al Kooper and Slade. \\"Smiling Phases\\" was recorded by Blood, Sweat & Tears on their self-titled second album released in 1968.Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)#Track listing Track Listing of Blood, Sweat & Tears (album) Retrieved 5 January 2014 \\"Dealer\\" was recorded as part of the medley \\"Dealer/Spanish Rose\\" by Santana on their Inner Secrets album released in 1978. Reception A review in the Apr 27, 1968 edition of Rolling Stone called the album \\"one of the best from any contemporary group\\". The reviewer felt that Steve Winwood's voice had \\"matured, acquired new depth and new reaches, a more individual feeling and a greater range in both style and tones\\", and considered that \\"the strongest points of this album are where the elements of Traffic's 'comprehensible far-out' and Winwood's great R&B; style are combined\\", but deemed Mason's contributions to be good enough in their own right.. It was voted number 517 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000). Legacy Allmusic's retrospective review is positive, calling Traffic's music \\"eclectic, combining their background in British pop with a taste for the comic and dance hall styles of Sgt. Pepper, Indian music, and blues-rock jamming\\". In 1999 the album was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame.https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/hall-of-fame Track listing =Original US version= Personnel ;Traffic *Jim Capaldi ‚Äì drums, percussion, vocals *Dave Mason ‚Äì guitar, Mellotron, sitar, tambura, harmonica, percussion, bass guitar on \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" and \\"Dealer\\",http://www.stevewinwood.com/news/5546 vocals *Steve Winwood ‚Äì Hammond organ, guitar, bass guitar, piano, harpsichord, percussion, vocals, arrangements *Chris Wood ‚Äì flute, saxophone, Hammond organ, percussion, vocals, sleeve design with: *Jimmy Miller ‚Äì producer, maracas on \\"Dear Mr. Fantasy\\" *Small Faces (Steve Marriott, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLagan, Kenney Jones) ‚Äì backing vocals and percussion on \\"Berkshire Poppies\\" *Francine Heimann - spoken-word midsection on \\"Hole in My Shoe\\" (uncredited) from US Version ;Technical *Eddie Kramer ‚Äì engineer *John Benton-Harris ‚Äì photography *Margaret Goldfarb ‚Äì re-release coordinator References External links *[ Traffic's Traffic] at allmusic.com *Traffic at JimCapaldi.com *Traffic at Music.com * Traffic (band) albums Island Records albums 1967 debut albums Albums produced by Jimmy Miller Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients United Artists Records albums Polydor Records albums Albums recorded at Olympic Sound Studios ","title":"Mr. Fantasy"},{"id":"1783966","text":"A cooperative database is a type of database that holds information on customers and their transactions.

A skilled statesman, Sultan Husayn Bayqara was best known for his interest in the arts and was renowned as a benefactor and patron of learning in his kingdom, with his reign being heralded as the second Timurid Renaissance.The Archaeology of Afghanistan from Earliest Times to the Timurid Period by Frank Raymond Allchin, Norman Hammond, Nicholas G. Hammond, page 379 He has been described as \\"the quintessential Timurid ruler of the later period in Transoxiana\\" and his sophisticated court and generous artistic patronage was a source of admiration, particularly from his cousin, the Mughal emperor Babur.Lisa Balabanlilar The Begims of the Mystic Feast: Turco-Mongol Tradition in the Mughal Harem, The Journal of Asian Studies Vol. 69, No. 1 (2010), p. 128 Sultan Husayn Bayqara was the last Timurid ruler of consequence in Khorasan. Early life and lineage Husayn Bayqara was born as Sultan Husayn in Herat in June/July 1438. His parents were Ghiyas ud-din Mansur Mirza of the Barlas tribe and his wife, Firuza Sultan Begum. His parents had four other children; a son, Bayqara Mirza II, as well as three daughters, Aka Biki, Badi al-Jamal and Urun Sultan Khanum.John E Woods, The Timurid Dynasty (1990), p. 24-5, 27 His father was a great-grandson of the Central Asian conqueror Timur. His mother was the daughter of Sultan Husayn of the powerful Tayichiud tribe, for whom he was named. Firuza was also herself a great-granddaughter of Timur twice over. Both his parents were also descendants of the Mongol Emperor, Genghis Khan. In addition to this, he claimed descent in the ninth generation from Khwaja Abdullah Ansari of Herat, also known as Pir-e-Herat (Sage of Herat). Sultan Husayn's father died when he was seven or eight years old. Given that the latter was not a noteworthy personality in the Timurid family, Sultan Husayn adopted the name Bayqara after his more illustrious grandfather, Bayqara Mirza I. After consulting with his mother, Sultan Husayn (now Sultan Husayn Bayqara) entered the service of his older cousin, Abul- Qasim Babur Mirza, ruler of Herat in 1452. Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza was not the best ruler. He mismanaged his territory and went into battle against Abu Sa'id Mirza, the Timurid ruler of Samarkand. Husayn Bayqara, not happy with his employment, tried to go over to Abu Sa'id Mirza by meeting with him. Although Abu Sa'id was inclined to take him into his service, a rebellion on part of Husayn Bayqara's relative, Sultan Awais Mirza, son of Muhammad Mirza, son of Bayqara Mirza, induced Abu Sa'id to arrest Husayn Bayqara and other relatives as a precaution. Eventually on the plea of his mother, Firuza Begum, he was freed and he rejoined Abul-Qasim Babur Mirza till the latter's death two years later. Period of Anarchy in Khurasan Following Babur's death in 1457, a period of anarchy ensued in Khurasan. Economic instability and lack of central authority with frequent regime changes invited the invasion of the region by the ruler of Samarkand, Abu Sa'id Mirza who occupied Herat on July 19, 1457. But Abu Sa'id Mirza immediately abandoned the city in order to deal with troubles at home. Next came the invasion of the Kara Koyunlu leader, Jahan Shah who took Mazandaran. During this chaotic time Khurasan was divided into many territories; *Asterabad to Sabzevar ‚Äì Muzaffar-al-Din Jahan Shah ibn Yusuf of Kara Koyunlu *Balkh ‚Äì Abu Sa'id Mirza, ruler of Transoxiana *Abivard ‚Äì Ala al-Dawla Mirza *Herat ‚Äì Ibrahim Mirza *Tus & Imad Fortress ‚Äì Shah Mahmud Mirza *Marv ‚Äì Sultan Sanjar Mirza *Sistan, Farah & Isfizar ‚Äì Malik Qasim ibn Amir Iskander Turkmen, an Amir. In Merv and Khwarazm Husayn Bayqara, unable to compete with these rivals, adopted the life of a mercenary and joined Sultan Sanjar Mirza of Merv who married him to his daughter, Beqa Sultan Begum. To them was born Badi' al-Zaman Mirza. Sultan Sanjar Mirza and Husayn Bayqara got along well, but in June/July 1457 when Sanjar appointed Husayn in charge of the city while he was absent, Husayn tried to take power. This was due to him suspecting that the chief dignitary, Hasan Arlat was plotting to kill him. Amirs loyal to Sanjar revolted and the attempt failed. Husayn Bayqara was forced to escape with just five horsemen. But outside the city he was joined by the head of security of trade caravans of Iranji sector, Hasan Charkas and his 200 men. This would become Husayn Bayqara's first mercenary force. To solidify this new relationship, he married Hasan Charkas' daughter, AfƒÅk Begum. He was chased by Sanjar Mirza to Karakum Desert. He was continuously pursued until he was forced to march towards Khwarazm, where he remained between the deserts of Marv and Khiva. Timurid-Kara Koyunlu Conflict Recognizing the weakness of Timurid authority in Herat, Jahan Shah invaded and took the city on June 28, 1458, which was now occupied by Ibrahim Mirza's father, Ala al-Dawla Mirza. But Abu Sa'id Mirza could not tolerate this and after negotiations, Jahan Shah decided to return territorial demarcation to Shah Rukh's times. Thus, Khurasan, Mazandaran and Jurjan were returned to the Timurids and Abu Sa'id Mirza returned and took Herat a second time on December 22, 1458. Conflict with Abu Sa'id Mirza Husayn Bayqara had now mustered a force of 1,000 men and took Jurjan on October 19, 1458 from the Kara Koyunlu. Abu Sa'id Mirza invaded Jurjan, which Husayn Bayqara hastily abandoned and fled towards Khwarazm again. Abu Sa'id Mirza appointed his son, Sultan Mahmud Mirza as Jurjan's governor. When Husayn Bayqara learned that Abu Sa'id Mirza had left Herat to crush the rebellion of his relative Muhammad Juki, he attacked Jurjan again and at the Battle of Jauzi Wali in May 1461, he defeated Sultan Mahmud Mirza and appointed Abdal-Rahman Arghun the territory's governor. However, he could not follow up this victory when he besieged Herat from August‚ÄìOctober 1461. Abu Sa'id Mirza returned and Husayn Bayqara again fled towards Khwarazm, from where he began making pillaging raids into Khurasan; these raids were conducted in earnest starting in 1464. Seeking to protect himself against Abu Sa'id, he requested the help of the Uzbeks. But that help never came since Abul-Khayr Khan, the Uzbek leader died in 1468. This period of 8 to 10 years was the worst in Husayn Bayqara's life. He wandered from one place to the next at times in dire straits. Becoming ruler of Khurasan When Abu Sa'id Mirza went to war against the Ak Koyunlu, he was defeated at the Battle of Qarabagh and captured. The leader of the Ak Koyunlu, Uzun Hasan handed him over to the 19-year-old Timurid Yadgar Muhammad Mirza, who had him executed. Upon Abu Sa'ids death, the Timurid Empire collapsed. Taking advantage of Abu Sa'id Mirza's absence, Husayn Bayqara had again entered Khurasan and besieged Herat which he finally captured on March 24, 1469. Thus he became the ruler of Khurasan. The sons of the late Abu Sa'id Mirza attempted to march against him, but turned back when they learned that not only had Husayn Bayqara consolidated his control over the city, but the defeated army of their father had joined him. Conflict with Ak Koyunlu and Yadgar Muhammad Mirza Meanwhile, Uzun Hasan sent his protege, Yadgar Muhammad Mirza, to conquer Khurasan. Husayn defeated Yadgar at the Battle of Chenaran on September 15, 1469, but the latter was sent reinforcements. Uzun Hasan demanded that Husayn hand over various Kara Koyunlu officials who had fled to him, a demand which Husayn refused. Yadgar therefore continued his assault, and Husayn was unable to match his forces due to mass desertions. He ended up fleeing Herat, which was occupied on July 7, 1470. Six weeks later, Husayn reoccupied the city after raising a fresh force and defeating the sons of Abu Sa'id, who were attempting to advance into the region. He captured Yadgar and executed him. Husayn's empire was now secure. The Ak Koyunlu made no further attempts against him, and the Timurids in Transoxiana were too weakened by internal conflicts to advance into his territory. His boundary with the Ak Koyunlu started on the southern edge of the Caspian Sea, running south, then east across the north of the Dasht-e Lut, ending at Lake Hamun. His border with the Timurids was the Oxus River. He more or less respected both borders, refusing to cross north in an attempt to capture Transoxiana from his former enemies. He was probably aware of the Uzbek threat to the region, and was wise enough not to pursue a border with this dangerous tribal people. Administration Husayn was viewed as \\"a good king, a lover of peace and justice\\", and he built numerous structures including a famous school; however, he was sick with a palsy for twenty years of his reign.Stevens, John.

He was forced to deal with several revolts and incursions. In 1490 the brother of Husayn's son Ibrahim Husain's guardian, Darvish 'Ali, conspired with Sultan Mahmud, who by that time ruled in Hisar. Mahmud moved against Balkh, which Ibrahim resided in, forcing Husayn to mobilize against him. Some years later, Husayn transferred his eldest son, Badi' al-Zaman, from Astarabad (renamed Gorgan in 1937) to Balkh, but Badi' revolted when his son Muhammed Mu'min was denied rule in Astarabad. Husayn defeated both Muhammed, whom he executed, and Badi', whom he reconciled with. The truce fell apart afterwards, however, and in 1499 Badi' besieged Herat. Uzbek threat In 1501 the Uzbeks conquered Transoxiana for good from the Abu Sa'id's grandson, Babur. Under Muhammad Shaybani, the Uzbeks could now threaten Khurasan. Suffering from the effects of advanced age, Husayn made no move against them, even after Babur advised him to act. The Uzbeks began conducting raids into his kingdom. Finally changing his mind, he began to march against them but died in 1506 just after beginning his advance. The inheritance of his empire was disputed between his sons Badi' and Muzaffar Husain. Babur, who had begun an expedition in support of Husayn, noted the infighting between the brothers, decided the area was impossible to defend and retreated. The next year, Muhammad Shaybani conquered Herat and caused Husayn's successors to flee, putting an end to Timurid rule in Khurasan.

It is about southwest of the city of Padua, at the southern edge of the Euganean Hills (Colli Euganei). History The town's mythological foundation is attributed to the Trojan hero Opsicella. The area shows evidence of human settlement since the Bronze Age. In Roman times it was known as Mons Silicis, meaning \\"mountain of flintstone\\", possibly due to the local quarries of trachyte. The earliest known documents about Monselice date back to 568 AD and are related to the conquest of the town by the Lombards. The town was under Byzantine rule for a brief period until its conquest by king Agilulf around 602.Paul the Deacon, History of the Lombards, 4.25; translated by William Dudley Foulke, 1907 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1974), p. 168 During the Comuni period (12th century) the town had its own local self-government. The town was aligned with the Ghibellines against the Guelphs in the political and military fights of the 13th century. The Ghibelline leader Ezzelino III da Romano improved the town's fortifications and made it one of the main strongholds of the area. The town was then under the Carraresi (the lords of Padua) rule and in the 15th century it became part of the Republic of Venice. After a short period of French domination, it was part of the Austrian Empire and, later, of its client Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. In 1866 it became part of the Kingdom of Italy. Main sights Monselice - Panorama. The modern town lies in a wide valley between the Montericco, elevation , and the Rocca, elevation , hills (part of the Euganean Hills). The oldest part of the town lies around the Rocca hill. In medieval times the Rocca was heavily fortified with five girdle walls that are partially still visible today. Important points for tourists can be the central square Piazza Mazzini with the medieval (Civic Tower) and the (Public Pawn Palace). This building hosts the local touristic promotion board (), that provides information for visits to the town's historical attractions. Piazza Mazzini square is also the starting point for the promenade walk along , leading to the most interesting sites of the town, which include: *The Castle of Monselice (or ), which houses one of the most important collections of European medieval weapons and armors. * *The Romanesque church of (12th century). *The Seven Churches Sanctuary ( or ) with paintings by .

It is a tower built with regular trachyte blocks from local quarries. Culture A lively market is held every Monday in the town's main streets. An important fair is traditionally held every year around November 1 (All Saints Day - saint patron day for the town). Attractions include a food and general market, local food stands, fun park, exhibits. Started in recent years, the \\"Palio di Monselice\\" tournament has become a primary attraction. The Palio is held every year in September. It is modeled after medieval horse tournaments and it includes several other competitions: archery, chess tournament (also in the form of human chess), musicians tournament (with tambourines and \\"chiarine\\"), flag-flyers, millstone challenge and the parade of nine \\"contrade\\" in period costume. Transportation Monselice is well connected to the major towns of Padua, Venice and Bologna. Monselice railway station is on the Venice-Padua-Bologna- Florence line, between Padua (North) and Bologna (South). A secondary railway line connects Monselice to the town of Mantua in Lombardy.

Snipes is officially credited as being the original inspiration for NetWars. It was one of the earliest text mode multi player games, running on Novell NetWare systems.  Gameplay  The objective of the game is to control your creature by moving it around a maze to destroy snipes and their hives, and/or destroy other networked players. The player must first specify the number of snipes, hives and difficulty before they play. Each game is different because the computer generates a random new maze. The creature is moved using the keyboard arrow keys and shoots in different directions with the , , and keys. By combining keys, diagonal movement and shooting can be achieved. Pressing the spacebar can provide extra velocity to run away from difficult situations from the snipes. Several level options are available. First, a letter is chosen, which controls the environment settings: what bad guys are available, their accuracy at attacking, whether or not the player's diagonal shots bounce off walls, whether running into a wall will simply block or kill you, and whether the hives have a partial resistance to snipes' shots. The next choice is a number, which controls the maximum number of snipes that may exist, how many hives are initially created within the maze, and how many lives the player is given.  Technical details  A requirement to play the multiplayer version of Snipes is that all users share a common network drive. It suggests that the various clients communicate to each other via shared file. The exact implementation details of this are not known but experiments have shown that Snipes can be played between Windows workstations in a Command Prompt window under Windows XP, provided that each user maps a drive to the executable location with read/write rights. This also implies that IPX is not directly used by Snipes to communicate between clients. Legacy  A newer implementation of the game was developed and shipped with NetWare Lite 1.1 in September 1991. Its NLSNIPES.EXE executable had a filesize of less than 18 KB. It was replaced by the NetWars 2.06 game, that came bundled with Personal NetWare 1.0 and Novell DOS 7 since late 1993\\\\. In July 2016, a port of the original Snipes to the Simple Direct Media Layer became available. The port was done by reverse engineering the original code and permission was granted by Drew Major and Kyle Powell to make it public. The C++ source code is available at GitHub. Clones were released for Linux and Android.

Shipped to England, Canterbury Cathedral, Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London were all partially built from Caen stone. Underground mining developed in the 19th century, but the stone trade declined in the 20th century eventually ceasing in the 1960s. Excavation restarted in the 1980s with the stone being used for building the Caen Memorial. A 2004 decree by Caen city council authorised the annual quarrying of 9000 tonnes of stone. =Notable examples= *Caen stone was used in the construction of the late 11th-century austere Norman Romanesque Church of Saint-√âtienne, at the Abbaye-aux-Hommes (on the east side of Caen), which was founded by William the Conqueror, whose tomb is located there. *The Norman Romanesque Church of La Trinit√©, at the Abbaye-aux-Dames (on the west side of the city), was founded by William's wife, Matilda of Flanders. Her tomb is located there. *Both abbeys in Caen were built with Caen stone in Norman Romanesque style, and both were unscathed by heavy aerial bombing in July 1944 that destroyed much of the city, as they were being used by the local populace to shelter from the air raids.page 28 of guidebook published by the Society of Friends of St Etienne Abbey, Caen *Used by the Normans for the cathedral and castle in Norwich, where it was brought by boat up the River Wensum. Caen stone was also used extensively in Canterbury cathedral. It was used by Henry I of England at Reading Abbey and fine examples of Romanesque sculpture in Caen stone are in the collection at the Museum of Reading. Perhaps the most famous building in Caen stone built in Norman times is the Tower of London. *Caen stone continued to be a popular material in Britain after the Norman period. For example, it was used for parts of the 19th-century clock tower at the Palace of Westminster. *Caen stone has also been exported to the United States, Bermuda and recently Saudi Arabia. The narthex screen on the east wall of the sanctuary at Old South Church in Boston, Massachusetts is built of Caen stone. The high altar of St. Mary's Church in Dedham, Massachusetts is made of Caen stone.

He was the only Dalai Lama to die in childhood and was first of a string of four Dalai Lamas to die before reaching 22 years of age.  Early life  Under auspicious signs, Lungtok Gyatso was born near the monastery of Dan Chokhor (or Denchokor), on 1 December 1805. Many sources render him as an orphan, but others name his parents as Tendzin Chokyong and Dondrub Dolma. A contestant to be the next Dalai Lama since early infancy, the boy was brought to Gungtang monastery near Lhasa, where he was examined by Tibetan officials, including the Qing representatives, the ambans. He was the favored choice of the Eighth Dalai Lama's attendants.

'The lama's beautiful and interesting face engrossed all my attention,' Manning wrote. 'He had the simple, unaffected manners of a well-educated princely child. His face was, I thought, affectingly beautiful. He was of a gay and cheerful disposition. I was extremely affected by this interview with the lama. I could have wept through strangeness of sensation.'\\" The Seventh Panchen Lama gave the boy the vows of novice monk in Lhasa in 1812, on 22 September.

The results of square-inch analysis are used to improve the process of assigning merchandise offers to pages and allocating space in future catalogs, a process called page planning or pagination. Theory Direct marketing businesses must record the revenues and profits received from merchandise sales in order to satisfy basic legal requirements and calculate tax liabilities. Sales of individual items must be tracked in order to fulfill customer orders and manage inventories. As a result, the gross profit and profit margin for each item sold can be calculated as a means of determining which items are most profitable to the business and its owners. The costs of producing and distributing mail-order catalogs can also be measured. These costs include graphic design, copywriting, photography, print production, postage, and mailing list rental. These costs are typically tracked and totaled for entire publications, rather than for individual items of merchandise offered for sale on the pages of the publication. Square-inch analysis provides the means of allocating these costs to individual items according to the amount of space their sales offers occupy on pages, on a percentage basis (as measured in square inches). =History= Space-based analysis of profitability of individual items originated with self-service retail stores. This method of analysis was applied to mail-order catalogs starting in the 1990s, when the popularity of mail-order shopping rose sharply and direct marketers sought to increase their profitability. One of the earliest mentions of this technique in published articles was in 1996. The principles have remained largely unchanged to the present day, but the increasing complexity of interaction between marketing channels (direct mail, mass media, internet, retail) and sales channels (postal, telephone, internet, retail) make precise space-based profitability analyses of merchandise offers more and more difficult to obtain. =Rationale= The planning stages of catalog production involve assigning merchandise offers and their space allocations to pages in a publication of finite size. Based on an assumption that increased exposure leads to increased customer response, direct marketers seeking to maximize profits will choose to increase the exposure of their more profitable items by increasing the amount of space allocated to their offers. Square-inch analysis provides a means of normalizing the basis on which the profitability of published offers can be compared. =Place in Direct Marketing Cycle= Since square-inch analysis is derived from spatial measurements taken from published offers and actual sales results produced by those offers, it is normally undertaken at the conclusion of one promotional publication cycle, and before the beginning of the next. As a part of a larger discipline of marketing analytics, it might be seen as an \\"optional extra\\" that follows other effectiveness measurements and precedes another cycle of strategic planning. Applications Classic square-inch analysis was and still is used primarily by mail-order catalog publishers, because these vehicles contain multiple separate sales offers of varying size, and managers need a means of systematically subdividing aggregate publishing costs down to the individual item offer level. Printed offers in other formats (such as travel brochures, or magazine display ads) would also yield to this analysis. It has been suggested that square-inch analysis should play a role in website marketing analytics, but such use is not well documented. =Obtaining Measurements= For the simplest of merchandise sales offers, the rectangular area on a page occupied by an item's illustration, its descriptive copy, its order number and price can be measured by hand with a ruler and the square area calculated by the formula width (inches) x height (inches) = area (square inches). A simpler, less accurate measure can be obtained using fractional page sizes (e.g. quarter page, half page). Measurements are tabulated for each item offered on each page. In certain design presentations which display offer-specific content in two or more areas (such as an illustration and descriptive copy on facing pages), each separate area is measured and the areas are summed for that item in the tabulation. When an offer occupying a discrete area on a page comprises more than one item in a grouping, the collective area is subdivided by the number of items in the grouping and the apportionments are entered into the tabulation for each item. Non-offer areas such as front cover illustrations, postal address panels, indexes, order forms and editorial content are common in catalog designs. These areas can be treated individually in the same way as offers, or combined together with the space occupied by page margins, headlines, headers and footers and treated as \\"white space.\\" A more conservative square-inch analysis proportionately subdivides the total of all \\"white space\\" and adds an apportionment to each item's offer area so that the cost of every square inch of space is accounted for. With the emergence of software-assisted page planning, graphic design and page layout techniques, obtaining square-inch measurements has become at least partially automated. Software systems which store dimensional data related to sales offers as shown on page layouts should be capable of delivering the necessary area measurements for each item offered on each page in tabular form. =Obtaining Sales Data= The minimum data required for square-inch analysis consists of page number, unit sales volume, gross revenue, and gross profit for each item offered. Additional insights can be obtained from including unit return volume, unit of sale, merchandise category, style information or other descriptors in the sales data inputs to square-inch analysis. One common challenge for the business systems which record item sales data is relating it to the exact catalog page on which an item appeared. Another common challenge for business systems is identifying which sales were motivated specifically by a catalog offer. =Reporting= The fundamental quotient of square-inch analysis is item profit per square inch according to the formula item gross profit (dollars) / offer area (square inches) = item profit per square inch. Secondary calculations include unit volume per square inch, item revenue per square inch, gross profit and revenue per offer and per page. The elementary mathematical formulas involved in deriving the results of square-inch analysis can be easy modeled by formulas in a software spreadsheet. Support for page planning decisions requires that these results be numerically sortable. Businesses who utilize direct marketing can take this reporting a step further by applying design of experiments methodology. The direct marketer can create \\"look alike\\" control groups (selected from the qualified mail population using random sampling techniques) to calculate the incremental revenue per square inch. This is important because the marketer can understand the influence the direct marketing had on the customer's purchase decision. The challenge is the business must allocate a significant quantity of customers to the holdout control group to ensure results are statistically significant and the insights can be expected in future direct mail campaigns. =Automation= With the emergence of sophisticated software- assisted catalog publishing systems, square-inch analysis has become at least partially automated. As of 2012, at least six publishing systems claim to provide some form of square-inch analysis capability, and at least two are known to have been created primarily for this purpose.

Early life Kelzang Gyatso was born in Lithang of Eastern Tibet or Kham, in the present-day Garz√™ Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of present-day Sichuan province. At that time, the Dalai Lama's throne in Lhasa was occupied by Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, who had been installed by Lha-bzang Khan as \\"the real 6th Dalai Lama\\" in place of Tsangyang Gyatso. Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso still held this position (though most Tibetans did not consider him to be a legitimate Dalai Lama) when a monk at Litang monastery, spontaneously channeling the Nechung Oracle, identified Kelzang Gyatso as the reincarnation of Tsangyang Gyatso. Since this presented a contradiction of Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama, it was a controversial matter and potentially dangerous to the child. Subsequently, the Tibetan leader of a delegation from Lhasa covertly confirmed that the child was Tsangyang Gyatso's reincarnation. The child was quietly taken into Litang monastery for protection and training. In 1715, the Kangxi Emperor sponsored Kelzang Gyatso's entrance into Kumbum Monastery. This entrance was marked by formal ceremonies due to a Dalai Lama and thus signified a public challenge to Lha-bzang Khan's Dalai Lama.Mullin 2001, pp. 276‚Äì282 He was ordained by Ngawang Lobsang Tenpai Gyaltsen. His reign started when he was 12. While still a boy, Kelzang Gyatso demonstrated himself a prodigy of profound wisdom. Kelzang Gyatso became famous for his ability to spontaneously compose verse. Inspired by a sambhogakaya vision of the poet-monk Tsongkhapa, Kelzang Gyatso (whilst a youth), travelled to central Tibet where he gave a sermon before thousands of people. :\\"Of all the Gyalwa Rinpoche [Dalai Lamas], we Tibetans probably respect the seventh, Kalzang Gyatso, most of all because of his saintliness, because he devoted his whole life to the Three Precious Ones, seeking refuge not for himself but for all his people.\\"Norbu & Turnbull, Tibet: An account of the history, the religion and the people of Tibet, p. 311. The Dzungars invaded Tibet in 1717, deposed Ngawang Yeshey Gyatso, which met with widespread approval, and killed Lha-bzang Khan. However, they soon began to loot, rape and kill throughout Lhasa, destroying Tibetan goodwill towards them. They also viciously destroyed a small force sent by the Kangxi Emperor at the Battle of the Salween River in 1718 to support clear traditional trade routes.Richardson, Tibet and its History, p. 48f.Mullin 2001, p. 288 Many Nyingmapa and Bonpos were executed and Tibetans visiting Dzungar officials were forced to stick their tongues out so the Dzungars could tell if the person recited constant mantras (which was said to make the tongue black or brown). This allowed them to pick the Nyingmapa and Bonpos, who recited many magic-mantras.Norbu, \\"Bon and Bonpos\\", p. 8. This habit of sticking one's tongue out as a mark of respect on greeting someone has remained a Tibetan custom until recent times. Enthronement 7th Dalai Lama, Kelzang Gyatso in Tibetan painting A second and larger expedition sent by the Kangxi Emperor, together with Tibetan forces under Polhane (also spelled Pho-lha-nas) of Tsang and Gangchenney (also spelled Kang-chen-nas), the governor of Western Tibet,Mullin 2001, p. 290 expelled the Dzungars from Tibet in 1720. They brought Kelzang Gyatso with them from Kumbum to Lhasa and he was enthroned as the seventh Dalai Lama in the Potala in 1721, or in November 1720.Mullin 2001, p. 289 He took the novice vows of monk-hood from the 5th Panchen Lama Lobsang Yeshi, who gave him the name Kelsang Gyatso. He took the Gelong vows (full ordination) from Lobsang Yeshi in 1726. He received teachings from the tutor of Lobsang Yeshi, the Abbot of Gyumey Monastery and also from the Abbot of Shalu Monastery, Ngawang Yonten on all the major Buddhist philosophical treatises and became a master in both sutra and tantra. He was a great scholar and wrote many books, especially on the tantra. He was also a noted poet who, unlike the 6th Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, dwelt mainly on spiritual themes.The Dalai Lamas of Tibet, p. 101. Thubten Samphel and Tendar. Roli & Janssen, New Delhi.

The Kangxi Emperor (1654‚Äì1722 reigned 1661‚Äì1722) declared Tibet a protectorate of the Qing Empire and in 1727 installed two high commissioners, or Ambans, and a garrison of Qing troops from China in Lhasa.Mayhew & Kohn, Tibet, p. 31. The walls of Lhasa were torn down and \\"Kham (with Batang, Litang, Tatsienlu, etc.) annexed to the Chinese province of Sichuan.

Pho-lha-nas or Polhaney of Tsang, an important Tibetan aristocrat, ruled Tibet with Qing support in 1728‚Äì1747. In 1728 Kelzang Gyatso was invited to visit Beijing,Richardson, Tibet and its History, p. 52. but Pho-lha-nas only had him moved from Lhasa to Litang to make it more difficult for him to influence the government. After Pho-lha-nas died, his son Gyurme Namgyal ruled until he was killed by the Ambans in 1750. This provoked riots during which the Ambans were killed. The rebellion was quelled under the authority of the 7th Dalai Lama. A Qing army entered Tibet and restored order afterwards. Removal of the Regents and establishment of the Kashag There are two main versions of how this occurred. The Chinese version is that: In 1751, the Qianlong Emperor (1711‚Äì1799; ruled 1737‚Äì1796) issued a 13-point decree which abolished the position of Regent (Desi), put the Tibetan government in the hands of a four-man Kashag, or Council of Ministers, and gave the ambans formal powers. The Dalai Lama moved back to Lhasa to preside (in name) over the new government. The Tibetan version has it that: In 1751, at the age of forty-three, Kelzang Gyatso constituted the \\"Kashag\\" or council of ministers to administer the Tibetan government and the abolished the post of Regent or Desi, as it placed too much power in one man's hand and the Dalai Lama became the spiritual and political leader of Tibet. :\\"The 'king' or governor of Tibet was no longer appointed by the Chinese after 1750, and the Dalai Lama was tacitly recognized as sovereign of Tibet, with the exception of Kham and Amdo on the one hand and, on the other, Ladakh ‚Äî which was at first under Moghul suzerainty before being annexed by Kashmir after the Dogra war (1834‚Äì1842).\\" In 1753, Kelzang Gyatso founded the Tse-School in the Potala Palace and built the new palace of Norling Kalsang Phodrang at the Norbulingka. \\"At the request of the Shabdung Rinpoche Jigmi Dagpa (Jigs med grabs pa, 1724‚Äì1761), spiritual and temporal ruler of Bhutan, Dalai Lama VII helped in the creation of a gold- and-copper monastery roof in Bhutan.\\"Sheel, \\"The Institution of the Dalai Lama\\", p. 30.

Scupi became the capital of Dardania, which extended from Naissus to Bylazora, in the second century BC.Macedonia yesterday and today Author Giorgio Nurigiani, Publisher Teleurope, 1967 p. 77. The Dardanians had remained independent after the Roman conquest of Macedonia, because they had supported the Romans, hoping to enlarge their territory in this way. It is not clear when the Romans finally annexed Dardania and it seems most likely that the Dardani actually lost independence in 28 BC.Vladimir P. Petroviƒá, Pre-Roman and Roman Dardania Historical and Geographical Considerations, Balcanica XXXVII, p 10. Scupi grew up as a colony of legionnaires, mainly veterans of the Legio VII Claudia in the time of Domitian (AD 81‚Äì96), even though several legions of Crassus' army of 29-28 BC, may already have been stationed there, before the official imperial command in this area was instituted.The Cambridge Ancient History, John Boardman, Volume 13 of The Cambridge Ancient History, Author Averil Cameron, Contributor R.

Scupi was included in Moesia Superior after the province was formed in AD 6. From 272 AD, it was a colony inside the Roman province of Dardania after Dardania was established. Scupi was ravaged several times by barbarians, in AD 269 by the Goths, in 5th century by the Huns and finally in the year 518 was completely destroyed by an earthquake. Life in Scupi stopped after the earthquake and it is assumed that the people from Scupi moved to live on Kale, a hill in the center of Skopje.. The moving of the city is often connected with the founding of Justiniana Prima. Justiniana Prima was a legendary city founded by Justinian I, who reigned over the Eastern Roman Empire in 527‚Äì565. The connection is based on the assumption that the village Taor which is located near Skopje is Tauresium, Justinian I's birthplace, and by the description of Justininiana Prima by Procopius that suits Skopje's fortress (Kale), the Old Bazaar and the aqueduct which are still landmarks of Skopje. Excavations Pillar capital in Scupi. The excavations on the archaeological site started in the period between the two World Wars. Radoslav Gruiƒá discovered the early Christian basilica in 1925 and the most important discovery was made by Nikola Vuliƒá, a Serbian archeologist, when he found the ancient Macedonian theater. Nikola Vuliƒá was the archeologist that published most about Scupi. Excavations on the site were done in 1959‚Äì61 by Duje Rendiƒá-Mioƒçeviƒá that were published in 1981 and by Ivan Mikulƒçiƒá published in 1971 and 1973.

The second is the foundation of the Roman colonia that ended with the invasion by the Goths in AD 269. The third period is most distinguished and is represented by the remains of one civil basilica, a complex of baths (thermae) and one townhouse. The last, the fourth period that begins roughly after the invasion by the Ostrogoths from AD 472 or 489 is represented by remains of an early Christian basilica and a townhouse with apse. Scupi was completely destroyed in AD 518. Today, only the early Christian basilica, the civil basilica, the baths and townhouses along the road are recognizable. The Roman theatre is completely decayed. =Roman theatre= The theater is estimated to have been built in the 2nd century AD because of the signs Colonia Scupi Aelia on the seats. It is assumed that the theater was built for Hadrian, the Roman emperor, who was visiting the Balkan cities. The decoration of the Roman theater was on the highest level, comparable to the best in the world from that time. Ivan Mikulƒçiƒá writes that in the 1000 years of the ancient period, there is no building that has reached the refined level of art as in the Roman theater in Scupi. Nikola Vuliƒá claims that the theater in Scupi is larger than the one in Stobi, and Duje Rendiƒá-Mioƒçeviƒá claim that is the largest on the territory of modern North Macedonia. The theater was used only for theater performances, comedies and tragedies. There is no architectural proof that the theater was used for gladiator games as it is the case in the theater in Stobi.

Biography Self-portrait, 1830 James Ward - Venus Rising from her Couch - Born in London, and younger brother of William Ward the engraver, James Ward was influenced by many people, but his career is conventionally divided into two periods: until 1803, his single greatest influence was his brother in law George Morland; from that time, it was Rubens. From 1810 or so, Ward started to paint horses within landscapes; slightly later, he turned to very large-scale landscapes, of which Gordale Scar (Tate, London), completed in 1814 or 1815 and depicting Gordale Scar (Yorkshire) as an example of the sublime, is considered his masterpiece and a masterpiece of English Romantic painting. Gordale Scar Ward devoted much of the period 1815-21 to the painting of a gigantic work titled Allegory of Waterloo (now lost); this neither was much praised nor brought in the revenue Ward had hoped for. The experience may have embittered him, and the deaths of his first wife and a daughter were among other tragedies. Like many artists of the time, Ward sought commissions from wealthy gentry of their favorite horses, their favorite hunting dogs or their children. One such family that Ward painted and drew repeatedly, and whom he counted among his friends, were the Levett family of Wynchnor Park, Staffordshire. One of Ward's best-known portraits was his Theophilus Levett hunting at Wychnor, Staffordshire of 1817. Another was Ward's 1811 painting entitled The Reverend Thomas Levett and his favourite dogs, cock-shooting. Ward also painted a group portrait of three Levett children ‚Äî John, Theophilus and Frances Levett. (For the Levetts, see link to the Ward exhibit at the Yale Center for British Art.) Family James was the son of James and Rachael Ward. He was first married to Mary Ann Ward (no known relation) in 1794 and after her death to Charlotte Fritche in 1827 (supposedly a relative of his first wife). James and Mary Ann Ward had several children including: #Matilda Louisa Ward, who married the artist John Jackson. #George Raphael Ward, b. 1798, d. 1879 James Ward was the paternal grandfather of the painter Henrietta Ward and the great-grandfather of Leslie Ward, the Vanity Fair caricaturist. In 1830, Ward moved to Cheshunt (Hertfordshire) with his second wife, but he continued to work, particularly on religious themes. A stroke in 1855 ended his work, and he died in poverty. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Style The Deer Stealer James Ward was one of the outstanding artists of the day, his singular style and great skill set him above most of his contemporaries, markedly influencing the growth of British art. Regarded as one of the great animal painters of his time, James produced history paintings, portraits, landscapes and genre. He started off as an engraver, trained by William, who later engraved much of his work. The partnership of William and James Ward produced the best that English art had to offer, their great technical skill and artistry having led to images that reflect the grace and charm of the era. He was admitted for membership into the Royal Academy in 1811. An Overshot Mill in Aberdulais, Wales, 1847 Marengo 1824 (Private collection) The Levett Children. John, Theophilus and Frances Levett, Wychnor, Staffordshire, November 1811 One of Ward's best-known paintings,The Deer Stealer, was commissioned in 1823 for the sum of 500 guineas by Ward's patron Theophilus Levett. When the work was finished, Levett pronounced himself delighted with the results, and consequently raised the remuneration to 600 guineas. Subsequently, Ward was said to have been offered 1,000 guineas for the painting by 'a nobleman,' which he declined.

Background Born in Thaba-Tseka in 1938, Lekhanya completed his primary and secondary education in Roman Catholic Schools. After working as a migrant mine worker in South Africa, he joined the Basutoland Mounted Police in 1960. He became the only Masotho officer heading a paramilitary Police Mobile Unit (PMU) platoon soon after its formation in 1965. During the early 1970s, he received trainings at police academies in South Africa and Rhodesia, and later assumed command of the PMU as a Major General in 1975. Lekhanya also oversaw its transformation into the Lesotho Paramilitary Force, later known as Lesotho Defence Force. In power Lekhanya was commander of the army when he overthrew Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan in a 1986 military coup following revelations that he had been the victim of a hoax by two Pan-Africanist Congress military commanders exiled from South Africa, Potlako Leballo and Bernard Leeman. They had served Lekhanya as a Lesotho Paramilitary Force Major in 1977 under a false identity. The hoax had resulted in Lekhanya financing the Lesotho Liberation Army against himself. Lekhanya immediately sought to improve relations with South Africa, which were strained due to Jonathan's support of the African National Congress. Lekhanya also gave more power to Lesotho's king at first, but later came into dispute with him, and he deposed the king in another military coup in 1990. The king was later restored, and Lekhanya was overthrown in a 1991 military coup. In opposition Instead of retiring, Lekhanya contested the Mantsonyane constituency in the 1993 election as a BNP candidate but lost. Lekhanya then became leader of the Basotho National Party (BNP), an opposition party, replacing Retselisitsoe Sekhonyana, which had only a few seats in the parliament and, according to Lekhanya, was the victim of fraud in several elections. Lekhanya was elected as Party Leader of the BNP at its Conference in March 1999,\\"Committee of Privileges Reports to Parliament; Opposition MP Bereng Sekhonyana Murdered\\" , Summary of Events in Lesotho - 2nd Quarter 2006, trc.org.ls. and he was re-elected as Party Leader at the BNP Conference held on March 31-April 1, 2001.\\"BNP Conference Confirms Lekhanya as Leader\\" , Summary of Events in Lesotho - 2nd Quarter 2001, trc.org.ls.

He was, however, elected to the National Assembly through proportional representation., Lesotho Parliament website. On May 31, 2006, Lekhanya was temporarily suspended from the National Assembly in connection with alleged intimidation of the Speaker of the National Assembly, which the BNP leadership was said to have condoned and abetted, according to a motion of the National Assembly and a subsequent report from the Committee of Privileges. Four other MPs from the BNP were also suspended, but for lesser periods of time. In December 2010, Lekhanya was ousted as the party leader after a supermajority on a vote of no confidence on him.

Bathurst holds inmates sentenced under State or Australian criminal law, along with a small number of remand prisoners. The prison is made up of three sections: a medium-security and remand facility for male inmates, a minimum-security facility for male inmates, and a new maximum- security facility for male inmates, due to open in 2020. A small number of female inmates are housed within a separate compound on the grounds of the medium-security area. History Correction facilities were first established in the Bathurst town centre in circa 1830, as the Bathurst Gaol, adjacent to the Bathurst Court House, also designed by Barnet. As sanitary conditions at the town watch house deteriorated, a new gaol was built to Barnet's designs. The old gaol was demolished in 1889.Australian Town and Country Journal,Sat 27 Jul, Page 13 https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71121592?searchTerm=bathurst%20gaol%20demolished The gaol was proclaimed on 7 June 1888, and built at a cost of just over 102,000 pounds. The hand-carved sandstone gate at the new gaol featured an ornate sculptured lion's head holding a key that is a Victorian symbol designed to impress wrongdoers with the immense power and dignity of the law. Legend has it that when the key falls from the lion's mouth, the prisoner are allowed to go free. The new building which contained 308 cells and \\"commodious workshops\\" was complete and partly occupied in 1888. This was one of a number of gaols rebuilt or enlarged in this period, the purpose of which was to commence the program of 'restricted association' of prison inmates. The Governor of the Bathurst gaol reported on restricted association as follows: > \\"The restricted treatment for male prisoners has been in vogue for the past > seventeen months, and has worked in every way satisfactorily. The prisoners > are more obedient, and there is a marked improvement in the discipline; > several of them have on many occasions told me that they would not desire to > return to the old system. On the 11th December, the new treatment was > introduced into the female division, under the supervision of the > Comptroller-General for Prisons everything passed off satisfactorily, and > ever since has worked well. A few days afterward the whole of the prisoners, > by yards (when mustered for dinner) desired me to thank the Comptroller- > General for his kindness in placing them under the treatment, stating that > they were grateful for the concessions allowed to them in the way of reading > and light at night.\\" Marble cutting and polishing provided works for the prisoners between 1893 and 1925. The gaol accommodated the tougher and more experienced prisoners until 1914 when the gaol then catered for the \\"previously convicted but hopeful cases\\". During WW1, rural industries such as dairy, pig-raising, market gardening, hay and fodder production were established. During WW2, the gaol was used as an internment camp for some 200 German and other \\"enemy aliens\\". In 1957‚Äì62, a new cell block was built outside the gaol's wall with accommodation for 94 prisoners. In 1974, riots at the gaol caused much damage to the main buildings. The gaol generally accommodated prisoners where they \\"were deemed amenable to reformative influences\\" up until 1970 where the gaol was reclassified as a maximum security prison. =Riots= The Bathurst riots and Bathurst batterings were a series of violent disturbances and reprisals that occurred at the gaol in October 1970 and February 1974. The second outbreak of violence led to the partial destruction and temporary closure of the prison, and ultimately to a Royal Commission into the State's prison system. =Name change= Between 1992 and 1993, the name of Bathurst Gaol was changed to Bathurst Correctional Centre.  Description  Old Bathurst Gaol, demolished circa 1880 Bathurst Gaol is composed of a square compound with a gatehouse and two watch towers located at the far corners. The Governor and Deputy Governors Residences are located outside the main compound walls. Internally the (now demolished) chapel formed the focus of the gaol. Four cell ranges and the cookhouse radiated out from the chapel. On one side of the chapel forecourt was the totally separated female compound. On the other side was the male hospital. Bathurst and Goulburn gaols were almost identical in plan. Goulburn however remains more intact.

Operational between 1828 and 1856, the factory is now one of the 11 sites that collectively compose the Australian Convict Sites, listed on the World Heritage List by UNESCO. Collectively the Australian Convict Sites represent an exceptional example of the forced migration of convicts and an extraordinary example of global developments associated with punishment and reform. Representing the female experience, the Cascades Female Factory demonstrates how penal transportation was used to expand Britain's spheres of influence, as well as to punish and reform female convicts. Now operational as a museum and tourist attraction, the site is managed by the Port Arthur Historic Site Management Authority. History Some rooms in the Macquarie Street Gaol served as a temporary Hobart \\"Female Factory\\" in the mid-1820s. The Cascades Female Factory was purpose-built in 1828 and operated as a convict facility until 1856. It was intended to remove women convicts from the negative influences and temptations of Hobart, and also to protect society from what was seen as their immorality and corrupting influence. The Factory was located, however, in an area of damp swamp land, and with overcrowding, poor sanitation and inadequate food and clothes, there was a high rate of disease and mortality among its inmates. The Cascades Female Factory is the only remaining female factory with extant remains which give a sense of what female factories were like. It is included on the Australian National Heritage List. It was inscribed on the World Heritage list in July 2010, along with ten other Australian convict sites. Today the Cascades Female Factory Historic Site consists of three of the original five yards.

After the lake that covered the place was drained, the people had trouble finding drinkable water. When they found a source of cold, clear water, they called it \\"water from the Krya Vrysi (Cold Spring)\\", thus giving the town its name. The community Krya Vrysi became a municipality in 1990.

This refraction is due to the velocity of light through air, decreasing (the refractive index increases) with increased density. Atmospheric refraction near the ground produces mirages. Such refraction can also raise or lower, or stretch or shorten, the images of distant objects without involving mirages. Turbulent air can make distant objects appear to twinkle or shimmer. The term also applies to the refraction of sound. Atmospheric refraction is considered in measuring the position of both celestial and terrestrial objects. Astronomical or celestial refraction causes astronomical objects to appear higher above the horizon than they actually are. Terrestrial refraction usually causes terrestrial objects to appear higher than they actually are, although in the afternoon when the air near the ground is heated, the rays can curve upward making objects appear lower than they actually are. Refraction not only affects visible light rays, but all electromagnetic radiation, although in varying degrees. For example, in the visible spectrum, blue is more affected than red. This may cause astronomical objects to appear dispersed into a spectrum in high-resolution images. waxing crescent Moon as it sets into the horizon. Whenever possible, astronomers will schedule their observations around the times of culmination, when celestial objects are highest in the sky. Likewise, sailors will not shoot a star below 20¬∞ above the horizon. If observations of objects near the horizon cannot be avoided, it is possible to equip an optical telescope with control systems to compensate for the shift caused by the refraction. If the dispersion is also a problem (in case of broadband high-resolution observations), atmospheric refraction correctors (made from pairs of rotating glass prisms) can be employed as well. Since the amount of atmospheric refraction is a function of the temperature gradient, temperature, pressure, and humidity (the amount of water vapor, which is especially important at mid-infrared wavelengths), the amount of effort needed for a successful compensation can be prohibitive. Surveyors, on the other hand, will often schedule their observations in the afternoon, when the magnitude of refraction is minimum. Atmospheric refraction becomes more severe when temperature gradients are strong, and refraction is not uniform when the atmosphere is heterogeneous, as when turbulence occurs in the air. This causes suboptimal seeing conditions, such as the twinkling of stars and various deformations of the Sun's apparent shape soon before sunset or after sunrise. Astronomical refraction Atmospheric refraction distorting the Sun‚Äôs disk into an uneven shape as it sets in the lower horizon. Astronomical refraction deals with the angular position of celestial bodies, their appearance as a point source, and through differential refraction, the shape of extended bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Atmospheric refraction of the light from a star is zero in the zenith, less than 1‚Ä≤ (one arc-minute) at 45¬∞ apparent altitude, and still only 5.3‚Ä≤ at 10¬∞ altitude; it quickly increases as altitude decreases, reaching 9.9‚Ä≤ at 5¬∞ altitude, 18.4‚Ä≤ at 2¬∞ altitude, and 35.4‚Ä≤ at the horizon; all values are for 10 ¬∞C and 1013.25 hPa in the visible part of the spectrum. On the horizon refraction is slightly greater than the apparent diameter of the Sun, so when the bottom of the sun's disc appears to touch the horizon, the sun's true altitude is negative. If the atmosphere suddenly vanished at this moment, one couldn't see the sun, as it would be entirely below the horizon. By convention, sunrise and sunset refer to times at which the Sun's upper limb appears on or disappears from the horizon and the standard value for the Sun's true altitude is ‚àí50‚Ä≤: ‚àí34‚Ä≤ for the refraction and ‚àí16‚Ä≤ for the Sun's semi-diameter. The altitude of a celestial body is normally given for the center of the body's disc. In the case of the Moon, additional corrections are needed for the Moon's horizontal parallax and its apparent semi-diameter; both vary with the Earth‚ÄìMoon distance. Refraction near the horizon is highly variable, principally because of the variability of the temperature gradient near the Earth's surface and the geometric sensitivity of the nearly horizontal rays to this variability. As early as 1830, Friedrich Bessel had found that even after applying all corrections for temperature and pressure (but not for the temperature gradient) at the observer, highly precise measurements of refraction varied by ¬±0.19‚Ä≤ at two degrees above the horizon and by ¬±0.50‚Ä≤ at a half degree above the horizon. At and below the horizon, values of refraction significantly higher than the nominal value of 35.4‚Ä≤ have been observed in a wide range of climates. Georg Constantin Bouris measured refraction of as much of 4¬∞ for stars on the horizon at the Athens Observatory and, during his ill-fated Endurance expedition, Sir Ernest Shackleton recorded refraction of 2¬∞37‚Ä≤: ‚ÄúThe sun which had made ‚Äòpositively his last appearance‚Äô seven days earlier surprised us by lifting more than half its disk above the horizon on May 8. A glow on the northern horizon resolved itself into the sun at 11 am that day. A quarter of an hour later the unreasonable visitor disappeared again, only to rise again at 11:40 am, set at 1 pm, rise at 1:10 pm and set lingeringly at 1:20 pm. These curious phenomena were due to refraction which amounted to 2¬∞ 37‚Ä≤ at 1:20 pm. The temperature was 15¬∞ below 0¬∞ Fahr., and we calculated that the refraction was 2¬∞ above normal.‚Äù Day-to-day variations in the weather will affect the exact times of sunrise and sunset as well as moon-rise and moon- set, and for that reason it generally is not meaningful to give rise and set times to greater precision than the nearest minute. More precise calculations can be useful for determining day-to-day changes in rise and set times that would occur with the standard value for refraction if it is understood that actual changes may differ because of unpredictable variations in refraction. Because atmospheric refraction is nominally 34‚Ä≤ on the horizon, but only 29‚Ä≤ at 0.5¬∞ above it, the setting or rising sun seems to be flattened by about 5‚Ä≤ (about 1/6 of its apparent diameter). =Calculating refraction= Young distinguished several regions where different methods for calculating astronomical refraction were applicable. In the upper portion of the sky, with a zenith distance of less than 70¬∞ (or an altitude over 20¬∞), various simple refraction formulas based on the index of refraction (and hence on the temperature, pressure, and humidity) at the observer are adequate. Between 20¬∞ and 5¬∞ of the horizon the temperature gradient becomes the dominant factor and numerical integration, using a method such as that of Auer and Standish and employing the temperature gradient of the standard atmosphere and the measured conditions at the observer, is required. Closer to the horizon, actual measurements of the changes with height of the local temperature gradient need to be employed in the numerical integration. Below the astronomical horizon, refraction is so variable that only crude estimates of astronomical refraction can be made; for example, the observed time of sunrise or sunset can vary by several minutes from day to day. As The Nautical Almanac notes, \\"the actual values of ‚Ä¶the refraction at low altitudes may, in extreme atmospheric conditions, differ considerably from the mean values used in the tables.\\" Plot of refraction vs. altitude using Bennett's 1982 formula Many different formulas have been developed for calculating astronomical refraction; they are reasonably consistent, differing among themselves by a few minutes of arc at the horizon and becoming increasingly consistent as they approach the zenith. The simpler formulations involved nothing more than the temperature and pressure at the observer, powers of the cotangent of the apparent altitude of the astronomical body and in the higher order terms, the height of a fictional homogeneous atmosphere. The simplest version of this formula, which Smart held to be only accurate within 45¬∞ of the zenith, is: :R = (n_0 - 1) \\\\cot h_\\\\mathrm{a} \\\\,, where R is the refraction in radians, n0 is the index of refraction at the observer (which depends on the temperature and pressure), and ha is the apparent altitude of the astronomical body. An early simple approximation of this form, which directly incorporated the temperature and pressure at the observer, was developed by George Comstock: :R = \\\\frac {21.5 b} {273 + t} \\\\cot h_\\\\mathrm{a} \\\\,, where R is the refraction in seconds of arc, b is the barometric pressure in millimeters of mercury, and t is the Celsius temperature. Comstock considered that this formula gave results within one arcsecond of Bessel's values for refraction from 15¬∞ above the horizon to the zenith. A further expansion in terms of the third power of the cotangent of the apparent altitude incorporates H0, the height of the homogeneous atmosphere, in addition to the usual conditions at the observer: :R = (n_0 - 1)(1 -H_0) \\\\cot h_\\\\mathrm{a} - (n_0 - 1)[H_0 - \\\\frac{1}{2}(n_0 - 1)]\\\\cot^3h_\\\\mathrm{a} . A version of this formula is used in the International Astronomical Union's Standards of Fundamental Astronomy; a comparison of the IAU's algorithm with more rigorous ray-tracing procedures indicated an agreement within 60 milliarcseconds at altitudes above 15¬∞. Bennett developed another simple empirical formula for calculating refraction from the apparent altitude which gives the refraction R in arcminutes: :R = \\\\cot \\\\left ( h_\\\\mathrm{a} + \\\\frac {7.31} {h_\\\\mathrm{a} + 4.4} \\\\right ) \\\\,. This formula is used in the U. S. Naval Observatory's Vector Astrometry Software, and is reported to be consistent with Garfinkel's more complex algorithm within 0.07‚Ä≤ over the entire range from the zenith to the horizon. S√¶mundsson developed an inverse formula for determining refraction from true altitude; if h is the true altitude in degrees, refraction R in arcminutes is given by :R = 1.02 \\\\cot \\\\left ( h + \\\\frac {10.3} {h + 5.11} \\\\right ) \\\\,; the formula is consistent with Bennett's to within 0.1‚Ä≤. The formulas of Bennet and S√¶mundsson assume an atmospheric pressure of 101.0 kPa and a temperature of 10 ¬∞C; for different pressure P and temperature T, refraction calculated from these formulas is multiplied by :\\\\frac {P} {101} \\\\, \\\\frac {283} {273 + T} Refraction increases approximately 1% for every 0.9 kPa increase in pressure, and decreases approximately 1% for every 0.9 kPa decrease in pressure. Similarly, refraction increases approximately 1% for every 3 ¬∞C decrease in temperature, and decreases approximately 1% for every 3 ¬∞C increase in temperature. =Random refraction effects= The animated image of the Moon's surface shows the effects of atmospheric turbulence on the view. Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere scatters the light from stars, making them appear brighter and fainter on a time-scale of milliseconds. The slowest components of these fluctuations are visible as twinkling (also called scintillation). Turbulence also causes small, sporadic motions of the star image, and produces rapid distortions in its structure. These effects are not visible to the naked eye, but can be easily seen even in small telescopes. They perturb astronomical seeing conditions. Some telescopes employ adaptive optics to reduce this effect. Terrestrial refraction Terrestrial refraction, sometimes called geodetic refraction, deals with the apparent angular position and measured distance of terrestrial bodies. It is of special concern for the production of precise maps and surveys. Since the line of sight in terrestrial refraction passes near the earth's surface, the magnitude of refraction depends chiefly on the temperature gradient near the ground, which varies widely at different times of day, seasons of the year, the nature of the terrain, the state of the weather, and other factors. As a common approximation, terrestrial refraction is considered as a constant bending of the ray of light or line of sight, in which the ray can be considered as describing a circular path. A common measure of refraction is the coefficient of refraction. Unfortunately there are two different definitions of this coefficient. One is the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight, the other is the ratio of the angle that the line of sight subtends at the center of the Earth to the angle of refraction measured at the observer. Since the latter definition only measures the bending of the ray at one end of the line of sight, it is one half the value of the former definition. The coefficient of refraction is directly related to the local vertical temperature gradient and the atmospheric temperature and pressure. The larger version of the coefficient k, measuring the ratio of the radius of the Earth to the radius of the line of sight, is given by: :k = 503 \\\\frac{P} {T^2} \\\\left ( 0.0343 + \\\\frac {dT} {dh} \\\\right ), where temperature T is given in kelvins, pressure P in millibars, and height h in meters. The angle of refraction increases with the coefficient of refraction and with the length of the line of sight. Although the straight line from your eye to a distant mountain might be blocked by a closer hill, the ray may curve enough to make the distant peak visible. A convenient method to analyze the effect of refraction on visibility is to consider an increased effective radius of the Earth Reff, given by :R_\\\\text{eff} = \\\\frac {R} {1 - k} , where R is the radius of the Earth and k is the coefficient of refraction. Under this model the ray can be considered a straight line on an Earth of increased radius. The curvature of the refracted ray in arc seconds per meter can be computed using the relationship : \\\\frac {1} {\\\\sigma} = 16.3 \\\\frac{P} {T^2} \\\\left ( 0.0342 + \\\\frac {dT} {dh} \\\\right ) \\\\cos \\\\beta where 1/œÉ is the curvature of the ray in arcsec per meter, P is the pressure in millibars, T is the temperature in kelvins, and Œ≤ is the angle of the ray to the horizontal. Multiplying half the curvature by the length of the ray path gives the angle of refraction at the observer. For a line of sight near the horizon cos Œ≤ differs little from unity and can be ignored. This yields : \\\\Omega = 8.15 \\\\frac{L P} {T^2} \\\\left ( 0.0342 + \\\\frac {dT} {dh} \\\\right ), where L is the length of the line of sight in meters and Œ© is the refraction at the observer measured in arc seconds. A simple approximation is to consider that a mountain's apparent altitude at your eye (in degrees) will exceed its true altitude by its distance in kilometers divided by 1500. This assumes a fairly horizontal line of sight and ordinary air density; if the mountain is very high (so much of the sightline is in thinner air) divide by 1600 instead.

More than 5,000 women convicts are known to have spent time here. The Cascades Female Factory was originally established on the site of a failed rum distillery which was adapted and gradually expanded to comprise five conjoined, rectangular walled yards. After 1856, the site was used for a variety of institutional purposes before being sold in 1904 and subdivided.\\" The Cascade Brewery, the oldest brewery in Australia, is located here. Another landmark is All Saints' Anglican Church. Established in 1858, it is heritage listed. The building was designed by the prominent architect Henry Hunter. The Church is also renowned for containing a memorial plaque for school teacher and founder of women's cricket in Australia, Lily Poulett- Harris. South Hobart is also famous for its Keen's Curry sign. Originally, the sign read \\"VR 60\\" to mark the Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This was created when the son-in-law of the company's founder \\"purchased land in the foothills of Mount Wellington, overlooking Hobart, and in 1905 transformed it into a large advertising sign. Heavy stones were collected from the site, painted white and used to form the words 'Keen's Curry' in letters some fifty feet (15 m) high. Public uproar resulted, but Horace won the right to use it as an advertising sign. In June 1926 the familiar landmark briefly changed to read 'Hell's Curse' as a university prank, and students altered it again in 1962 to promote a theatre production. In 1994 the landmark read 'No Cable Car' as a protest against a proposed development. After every change the sign was restored and as of 2012 was still in place.\\" Sport and culture The area is known for its high green vote which is reflected by the existence of a community sustainability network. This is coordinated through a community. There is a strong sense of community, in part created by the suburb's location. It has an active community association - The South Hobart Progress Association Inc. founded in 1922 making it one of the oldest such organisations in Tasmania. All Saints' Anglican Church is today known for being Hobart's centre of Anglo- Catholic worship. The suburb is home to the very successful South Hobart SC. Known as 'SoHo (South Hobart) village' by locals. The Cascade Hotel is host to the weekly Gypsy Jazz Jam session, every Wednesday, for locals and visiting artists.

The Federal Council of Australasia was a forerunner to the current Commonwealth of Australia, though its structure and members were different. The final (and successful) push for the Federal Council came at a \\"Convention\\" on 28 November 1883, which met in Sydney, and at which the six Australian colonies, New Zealand and Fiji were represented.Federal Council of Australasia by Alfred Deakin (at University of Sydney Library) The conference was called to debate the strategies needed to counter the activities of the German and French in New Guinea and in New Hebrides. Sir Samuel Griffith, the Premier of Queensland, drafted a bill to constitute the Federal Council. The Federal Council was a limited legislative body. It had powers to legislate directly upon certain matters, such as in relation to extradition, regulation of fisheries, patents of invention and discovery and copyright, and so on, but it did not have a permanent secretariat, executive powers, or any revenue of its own. The representatives considered that the formation of the Council was a constitutional change that required an Act of the British Parliament. In July and August, 1884, the Legislatures of Victoria, Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia, and Fiji petitioned the Imperial Parliament to enact the bill. The bill became law on 14 August 1885 as the Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885,Federal Council of Australasia Act 1885note 2, at 18-21. and gave any Australasian colony power to join or withdraw from the Council. The first assembly of the Federal Council took place on 25 January 1886 in Hobart, Tasmania, and consisted of representatives of the self-governing colonies of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, and the Crown Colonies of Western Australia and Fiji were involved. New South Wales and New Zealand did not join the Federal Council. South Australia was briefly a member between 1888 and 1890. The Federal Council met eight times between 1886 and 1899, to discuss matters of importance and common interest. It had no power to enforce its decisions beyond that provided by the member colonies. Furthermore, the absence of the powerful colony of New South Wales weakened its representative value. Robert Hamilton from Tasmania presided over the Federal Council meetings held in Hobart in 1887, 1888, and 1889. Adye Douglas, Premier of Tasmania from 1884 to 1886, represented Tasmania on the Federal Council. Thomas Joseph Byrnes represented Queensland at meetings of the Federal Council in 1895 and 1897.

The facility is operated by the Tasmanian Prison Service, an agency of the Department of Justice of the Government of Tasmania. The facility accepts felons charged under Tasmanian and/or Commonwealth legislation pending legal proceedings; and also detains convicted felons, pending their classification and placement at other correctional facilities in Tasmania. History Convicts transported from England's overflowing prison system made a major contribution to Tasmania's settlement and development. Although some convicts returned to the United Kingdom at the completion of their sentence, a substantial number settled to become the farmers and business and professional people who helped build Tasmania into a thriving community. When transportation ceased in 1853, Tasmania was left with persons who still had lengthy sentences to complete. There was also a system of prison buildings and probation stations strategically located around Tasmania to serve the needs of convicts who were allocated to work on farms or public works such as road and bridge building. As the remaining number of convicts reduced, country prisons and probation stations, including Port Arthur, fell into disuse. The existing facilities left over from colonial times in Hobart and Launceston became the basis of the Tasmanian prison system for those persons who committed offences within Tasmania. Records from Launceston Gaol date back to 1839. By 1900, the Launceston Gaol, which by then held only a small number of short-term prisoners, was under the control of a superintendent who reported to the governor in Hobart. Female prisoners were kept in an annex attached to the male prison. The main purpose of the Launceston Gaol was as a repository for persons required to appear in courts in Launceston and those in transit to courts on the North West Coast. In 1914 part of the Launceston prison site was given to the Education Department for a new high school. The incompatibility of the new high school and the prison immediately adjacent resulted in the prison site being completely abandoned and the prison function transferred to the police watch house in 1917. The condition of the watch house was no better than the prison but continued in use until 1976 when new police buildings were constructed. The management of the Launceston Gaol was handed over to the Police department after World War I although the prisoners remained the responsibility of the prison system. A police officer in Launceston and each of the major towns was appointed as gaoler under the prison legislation to provide administrative control of prisoners outside Hobart. This system persisted until 1991 when full control and staffing of the prison function in Launceston was returned to Corrective Services. Facilities The centre has been described as an \\"horrendously bad building\\" and since the mid‚Äì1970s has provided short‚Äìterm accommodation with 33 cells. It is located in the main police building and provides short-term remand and watch house accommodation. In 1991 bars on the doors were replaced with solid doors and there are two observation cells.

It remains the most diverse correctional facility within Queensland accommodating high secure male, high secure female, high secure male protection, low open male custody and low open female custody operations. A new female facility began construction in June 2006 in a complex adjacent to the male section with its own secure perimeter. Female inmates were finally moved over to the new centre in December 2008. Townsville Correctional Centre's complex also includes a Farm Area located about south-east of the Prison, and near to the Woongarra Crematorium. Inaugural Superintendent - Mr. James Ryan was appointed on 6 April 1893, having been promoted from his former position as the Superintendent of the \\"old\\" Townsville Gaol, which was located at the site of the current Townsville Central State School on Warburton street in North Ward. Stewart's Creek Penal Establishment marked 120 years of operational service to the Queensland Community in 2013. Since the closure of Boggo Road Gaol in 1992, Townsville Correctional Centre is the longest continually operating Prison in Queensland. On 6 April 2015 it reached another milestone, the 125th anniversary of its establishment (6 April 1890) i.e. the date on which the building contractor Mr. Thomas Matthews accepted and signed the contract to construct the penal establishment, within two years. Work began on the \\"Her Majesty's Penal Establishment Stewart's Creek\\" on 9 June 1890.

From 1259 to 1293, he ruled the kingdom of Imereti under the name David I as a vassal state of Georgia. Life The son of Queen Rusudan by her husband, Ghias ad-din, David was crowned at Kutaisi, as joint sovereign by his mother in 1230. Fearing that her nephew David VII Ulu would claim the throne at her death, Rusudan held the latter prisoner at the court of her son-in-law, the sultan Kaykhusraw II, and sent her son David to the Mongol court to get official recognition as heir apparent. She died in 1245, still waiting for her son to return. Since David was believed by the Georgian nobles to have disappeared, two years later, they proclaimed his cousin David VII Ulu, who had been freed on the death of Kaykhusraw, as king of Georgia. In 1248, David, son of Rusudan, was recognized by G√ºy√ºk Khan as junior co-king to his cousin David. Thereafter known as David VI Narin (i.e. ‚Äúthe junior‚Äù) and David VII Ulu (i.e. ‚Äúthe senior‚Äù), the cousins ruled jointly until 1259, when the former rose, unsuccessfully, against the Mongol yoke and, then, fled to Kutaisi, from whence he reigned over western Georgia (Imereti) as a separate ruler. In 1261, he gave shelter to David VII Ulu, who in his turn had attempted to end the Mongol dominance. David Ulu made peace with the Mongols and returned to Tbilisi, eastern Georgia in 1262. Thus, Georgia split into two parts and both rulers continued to be titled king of Georgia. However, David Narin surrendered to Hulagu Khan thus becoming a nominal vassal of the Ilkhans in 1262.C.P.Atwood - Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, p.197 He developed friendly relations with the Golden Horde and the Bahri dynasty of Egypt, and repulsed the Ilkhanate attacks. In 1269, David gave shelter to Teguder, relative of the Chagatai Baraq Khan, who had rebelled against the Ilkhan ruler Abaqa Khan. When Teguder‚Äôs force began terrorizing the Georgian population, David sided with Abaqa‚Äôs general Shiramun Noyan. Despite this, Abaqa attempted to overthrow David with the help of the renegade lord of Racha Kakhaber Kakhaberisdze, and sent two expeditions against Imereti in the 1270s. Nevertheless, David VI Narin succeeded in retaining his independence and attempted to restore Georgian influence in the Empire of Trebizond. For this purpose, he marched to Trebizond during Emperor John II Comnenus‚Äô absence at Constantinople in April 1282; and although he failed to take the city, the Georgians occupied several provinces and helped John‚Äôs half-sister Theodora, daughter of Manuel I of Trebizond by his Georgian wife, Rusudan, seize the throne in 1285, only to be put suddenly to flight.William Miller, Trebizond: The last Greek Empire of the Byzantine Era: 1204-1461, 1926 (Chicago: Argonaut, 1969), p. 30 He died at Kutaisi in 1293.

David is buried within the chapel (eukterion) of St. Andrew at the Cathedral of Nativity of the Theotokos of Gelati, east of the southern entrance to the church.

Biography Hughes was born in London. In 1846 he entered the art school at Somerset House, his first master being Alfred Stevens, and later entered the Royal Academy schools. It was here, after reading a copy of The Germ, that he met John Everett Millais, Holman Hunt, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, although he never became an official member of the Pre-Raphaelite group of painters. His first picture, Musidora, was hung at the Royal Academy when he was only 17, and thenceforth he contributed almost annually not only to the Royal Academy but later also to the Grosvenor and New Gallery exhibitions. After having his painting Ophelia hung near Millais' version of the same name, they became friends and Hughes served as the model for the male figure in The Proscribed Royalist. In 1855 Hughes married Tryphena Foord, his model for April Love. They had five children of whom one, Arthur Foord Hughes, also became a painter. Hughes died in Kew Green, London in 1915, leaving about 700 known paintings and drawings, along with over 750 book illustrations. Following the death of Tryphena Hughes in 1921, their daughter Emily had to move to a smaller house. There was, therefore, a shortage of space. As a result, she had her father's remaining preparatory sketches, and all his private papers and correspondence, destroyed. He was the uncle of Edward Robert Hughes. Hughes is buried in Richmond Cemetery. Works His best-known paintings are April Love and The Long Engagement, both of which depict troubled couples contemplating the transience of love and beauty. They were inspired by John Everett Millais's earlier \\"couple\\" paintings but place far greater emphasis on the pathos of human inability to maintain the freshness of youthful feeling in comparison to the regenerative power of nature. Like Millais, Hughes also painted Ophelia which is housed at Toledo Museum of Art and illustrated Keats's poem The Eve of St. Agnes. Hughes's version of the latter is in the form of a secular triptych, a technique he repeated for scenes from Shakespeare's As You Like It. His works are noted for their magical, glowing colouring and delicate draughtsmanship. The oil portrait Springtide, first exhibited in Dublin in 1855, features his wife Tryphena. = Illustrations = Although most of Hughes' later paintings are not well regarded, it is considered that the black and white drawings of his later career were some of his best. He illustrated several books, including Tom Brown‚Äôs Schooldays (1869), George Macdonald's At the Back of the North Wind (1871) and The Princess and the Goblin (1872) and Christina Rossetti‚Äôs Sing Song (1872) and Speaking Likenesses (1874).

Background The Aragonese succession laws at that time were based more on custom than any specific legislation, and even case law did not exist. All successions after the union of Catalonia with Aragon in 1137 had been to the eldest son, to the next younger brother, or to the only daughter. However, earlier successions indicated that agnates (males in the male line) of the Aragonese royal family had precedence over daughters and descendants of daughters; for example, Martin himself had succeeded over daughters of his late elder brother, King John I. However, very distant agnates had lost out to the daughter of the late king in the 11th century, when Queen Petronilla succeeded over claims of the then agnates (second cousins or the like), the kings of Navarre. J. N. Hillgarth writes: \\"Among the descendants by the male line, the closest relation to Martin was James II, Count of Urgell.\\"Hillgarth, Jocelyn Nigel (1978) The Spanish Kingdoms 1250-1516 volume 2 1410-1516: Castilian hegemony p 229 T. N. Bisson writes that \\"the issue was (or became) political rather than simply legal, a utilitarian question of which candidate with some dynastic claim would make the best king.\\"Bissonm Thomas N. (1991) The Medieval Crown of Aragon: a short history, pp 135-6, Candidates The major candidates for succession were: * James II, Count of Urgell, Martin's closest agnate as patrilineal great- grandson of Alfonso IV of Aragon. Incidentally, he was also Martin's brother- in-law. Appointed Lieutenant of the Kingdom by Martin, he was heir male of the line and claimed the throne according to agnatic primogeniture. * Louis of Anjou, matrilineal grandson of John I of Aragon and grandnephew of Martin. He was heir general to the line and claimed the throne according to cognatic primogeniture. * Alfonso I, Duke of Gandia, 80-year-old patrilineal grandson of James II of Aragon. He claimed the throne by both agnatic seniority and proximity of blood to the previous kings of Aragon. He died in March 1412. * John of Ribagorza, brother of Alfonso, who inherited his claim. * Ferdinand of Castile, matrilineal grandson of Peter IV of Aragon and nephew of Martin, claimed the throne by proximity of blood to the last king. * Frederic, Count of Luna, natural grandson of Martin of Aragon, being the bastard of Martin's predeceased son, Martin I of Sicily. Born illegitimate, he had been legitimized by Antipope Benedict XIII. = Family tree = Interregnum 1410‚Äì12 Salvador Vinegra's depiction of the deliberations The parties had agreed to a parliamentary process to resolve the issue, but coordinating deliberations between the cortes (parliaments) of Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia was made difficult by their diverging interests. Thus, a general cortes was demanded by the governor of Catalonia to meet in Montblanch, but the meeting was delayed and ended up in Barcelona, starting in October 1410 and only being Cortes of the Principality of Catalonia.Earenfight, Theresa (2003) \\"Caspe, Compromise of\\" page 208 in Gerli, E. Michael (editor) (2003) Medieval Iberia: An Encyclopedia Routledge, New York, As the Cortes dragged on, the situation became violent.

(2005) La din√°mica pol√≠tica p 458. Ediciones Istmo This event damaged the candidacy of James of Urgell and gave strength to the candidacy of Ferdinand of Castile (regent of Castile and therefore commanding a nearby army with which he protected his allies). There was fighting in the streets, especially between partisans of Aragon and Valencia. The conflict divided the Kingdom of Aragon, with two rival Cortes meeting: one favorable to Ferdinand of Castile in Alca√±iz, and another favorable to James II, Count of Urgell in Mequinenza (but this one was not recognized by the Catalan parliament at Tortosa).Salom, Jaime (1995) Jerusal√©n, hora cero: nueve brindis por un rey p 172. Editorial Fundamentos The same occurred in Valencia, with Cortes in Traiguera and Vinar√≤s. Furthermore, in 1410-1412 Ferdinand's troops entered Aragon and Valencia to fight the Urgellists. The Trastamarist victory at the Battle of Morvedre on 27 February 1412 finally left Valencia in their hands. =Conflicts and deliberations= Proclamation of Ferdinand I as king of Aragon, by Di√≥scoro Puebla Pope Bendict XIII (Avignon) intervened and proposed a smaller group of nine compromisarios (negotiators). The Trastamarist parliament of Alca√±iz agreed with the proposition, which was finally accepted by a Catalan-Aragonese board of fourteen Aragonese Trastamarists and five varied Catalan emissaries: the agreement known as the Alca√±iz Concord of 15 February 1412. But a few days later, the Alca√±iz parliament chose not only the three compromisarios from Aragon but also the three Catalan and the three Valencian compromisarios too. The angry complaints among the Catalan and Valencian parliamentarians for this abuse were ignored, targeting the peaceful discussions sought since 1410; and equally the complaints of James of Urgell and Louis of Anjou. The appointed compromisarios met in Caspe to choose the next king. The majority of historians have agreed with the account of the election by historian Jer√≥nimo Zurita. Zurita wrote his Anales de la Corona de Arag√≥n from the original records, which he bequeathed to the house of the General Deputation of Aragon in 1576 (they were lost or burned during political disorders in the 19th century). According to Zurita, the compromisarios had conflicting views about the succession to the deceased King Martin, and they voted differently as well. The votes were cast on Friday, 24 June 1412, and recorded on 25 June. Vincent Ferrer was the first one to speak; in a long speech, he voted for Ferdinand, and then Ram, his brother Bonifaci, Gualbes, Bardaix√≠, and Aranda simply joined him. Sagarriga, Vallseca, and Bertran voted differently, giving their own reasons. Portrait of Ferdinand of Castile, proclaimed king after the Compromise. Kingdom of Aragon delegates: *Dom√®nec Ram (bishop of Huesca): voted for Ferdinand of Castile *Francesc de Aranda (ancient royal councillor as well as envoy of Benedict XIII): voted for Ferdinand of Castile *Berenguer de Bardaix√≠ (jurist and official general of the Cortes of Aragon): voted for Ferdinand of Castile Kingdom of Valencia delegates: *Vicent Ferrer (Dominican friar, later canonized): voted for Ferdinand of Castile *Bonifaci Ferrer (brother of Vincent and prior of the monastery of Portaceli): voted for Ferdinand of Castile *Pere Bertran (substitute for Gener Rabassa, citizen of Valencia and legal expert): abstained Principality of Catalonia delegates: *Pere de Sagarriga i de Pau (archbishop of Tarragona): voted for James of Urgell and also for Alphonse of Gandia, but finally the vote have to be got by the most voted of both. *Bernat de Gualbes (syndicus and councillor of Barcelona): voted for Ferdinand of Castile *Guillem de Vallseca (officer general of the Corts Reials Catalanes): voted for James of Urgell On 28 June 28, Ferdinand of Castile was proclaimed king by Vicent Ferrer in a public speech also recorded. The knights Guillem Ramon Alemany de Cervell√≥ and √ç√±igo de Alfaro, who were present for the proclamation, brought the news of his election to Ferdinand. Revisionism In recent years, three Aragonese historians (Jos√© √Ångel Sesma Mu√±oz, Carlos Laliena, and Cristina Monterde) rejected Zurita's account, arguing that no contemporary sources confirm the existence of any secret ballot. Sesma claimed in 2011 that all nine compromisarios, despite their different preferences, agreed unanimously to select Ferdinand. He repeated this view in 2012 with Laliena and Monterde. Their main argument is that the official notarized deed of proclamation, issued on 25 June 1412, does not mention any results of the supposed election. Furthermore, they quoted testimonies (but not the full statements) from those who were present at the ceremony of proclamation on 28 June, such as Melchor de Gualbes, saying that the three Catalan compromisarios had declared that \\"they had acted freely and had not been under any pressure\\" and that at the end \\"everybody would be of one opinion\\". As of 2013, there are no new published works that support this new theory. Already in 2012, this point of view had been refuted by historian Ernest Belenguer, who called attention to the point that in this kind of election (as with papal conclaves), the results of the ballots are not published, therefore one cannot infer a unanimous election only from this kind of deed. He also mentioned that even Trastamara's official chronicler Lorenzo Valla said in the 15th century that there were very different opinions among the compromisarios. Furthermore, Belenguer cited other authors who in the 17th century had seen the same documents as Zurita, such as Uztarroz and Dormer, and reported the same account as Zurita of the preferences stated by every one of the nine compromisarios. Aftermath Reenaction of the Compromise Initially James II of Urgell accepted the sentence and even swore allegiance to the new king, but he revolted in May 1413. However, he was unsuccessful to mobilize more nobles after two years of fights and battles. There were some uprisings in support of James in Valencia and Catalonia and James himself lead sorties out from his domain in Urgell. James's supporters were defeated in battle on 25 June 1413 outside of Lleida. Ant√≥n de Luna enlisted the support of Gascon and English troops who invaded at Jaca, but they were defeated on 10 July 1413 before he was able to join James's army. In August, Ferdinand began the siege of Balaguer. Meanwhile, Ant√≥n de Luna had organized defenses in Huesca; however, the Castle of Montearag√≥n was taken on 11 August, and he and his troops fled to Loarre Castle. Finally, in October 1413 James surrendered at his city: Balaguer. The following January, Loarre Castle fell, and the rebellion was over. The County of Urgell was dissolved in 1413 and the area came under the royal domain of the county of Barcelona, but was shared out among the Trast√°mara's supporters. With the selection of a younger prince of the Castilian Royal House of Trast√°mara, the Aragonese Crown became increasingly drawn into the sphere of influence of the more powerful Castile. About 50 years after the Compromise, with the marriage of Ferdinand I's grandson Ferdinand II to Queen Isabella of Castile, Aragon became the junior partner in a dynastic union that would become the modern Spanish state.

The species was first described in a 2005 article by Paulina Jenkins and coauthors, who considered the animal to be so distinct from all living rodents, they placed it in a new family, Laonastidae. It is in the monotypic genus Laonastes. Skull of L. aenigmamus In 2006, the classification of the Laotian rock rat was disputed by Mary Dawson and coauthors. They suggested the rat belongs to the ancient fossil family Diatomyidae, which was thought to have been extinct for 11 million years, since the late Miocene. It would thereby represent a Lazarus species. The animals resemble large, dark rats with hairy, thick tails like those of a squirrel. Their skulls are very distinctive and have features that separate them from all other living mammals.  Classification  Upon their initial discovery, Jenkins and coauthors (2005) considered the Laotian rock rat to represent a completely new family. The discovery of a new species of an extant mammal genus, or a new genus, happens periodically, such as with the leaf muntjac or the saola. The discovery of a completely new family is, by comparison, much more unusual. The most recent incident before the discovery of the family Laonastidae by Western science was the discovery of the bumblebee bat (Craseonycteris thonglongyai; family Craseonycteridae) in 1974. The only other examples from the 20th century are species that are only considered distinct families by a few authorities. These discoveries are: the Chinese river dolphin (Lipotes vexillifer; family Lipotidae) in 1918, the Zagros mouse-like hamster (Calomyscus bailwardi; family Calomyscidae) in 1905, and Goeldi's marmoset (Callimico goeldii; family Callimiconidae) in 1904. Representatives from all the remaining rodent families with living representatives (approximately 30) were discovered before 1900. Jenkins et al. did not compare the specimens to known rodent fossils. After such a comparison, Dawson et al. believed the Laotian rock rat belongs to a previously described family, which had only been known from fossils, the Diatomyidae. The Diatomyidae are known from a series of fossils from the early Oligocene (~32.5 mya) until the Miocene (~11 mya). The discovery of the Laotian rock rat means an 11 million-year gap exists in the fossil record where no diatomyids have been found. Dawson et al. described the Diatomyidae as a Lazarus taxon due to this gap. The only other mammal Lazarus taxon with a comparable time gap between it and its most recently known fossil relative is the monito del monte, which is part of a marsupial family (Microbiotheriidae) also most recently known from Miocene deposits. Mary Dawson described Laonastes as the \\"coelacanth of rodents\\".Carey, Bjorn (2006-03-09) Back from the dead: Living fossil identified. MSNBC The analysis of mtDNA 12S rRNA and cytochrome b sequence by Jenkins et al. allied Laonastes with African hystricognath rodents, namely the blesmols and the dassie rat. Support for such a placement was fair, but the exact position could not be resolved. Huchon et al. conducted a large-scale molecular phylogeny of rodents, including representatives of all major rodent taxonomic groups, based on 5.5 kb of sequence data from four nuclear and two mitochondrial genes, and a short, interspersed element, insertion analysis including 11 informative loci. Their molecular data place Laonastes robustly as a sister clade of Ctenodactylidae, and support an ancient divergence during the Lutetian (Early/Middle Eocene, ~44 mya). The earlier molecular study was in error due to long branch attraction and inadequate sampling.  Etymology  The genus name for this animal, Laonastes, means \\"inhabitant of stone\\" (from Greek ŒªŒ±Œ±œÇ = laas = stone, gen: ŒªŒ±ŒøœÇ = laos = of stone and Greek ŒΩŒ±œÉœÑŒ∑œÇ = nastes = inhabitant). This is in reference to its presence around limestone rocks and also to the country where it was recently discovered. The specific epithet aenigmamus means \\"enigma mouse\\" (from Greek Œ±ŒπŒΩŒπŒ≥ŒºŒ± = √¶nigma and ŒºœÖœÇ = mus, \\"mouse\\") referring to its unknown position among the rodents (Jenkins et al., 2004).  Discovery  The first specimens were found for sale as meat at a market in Thakhek, Khammouan, in 1996. Remains of three additional animals were obtained in 1998 from villagers and in an owl pellet. Return trips to Laos by the Wildlife Conservation Society researchers uncovered several other specimens. These new discoveries have prompted the suggestion that the animals may not be as rare as once thought. On June 13, 2006, David Redfield, a professor emeritus of Florida State University, and Thai wildlife biologist Uthai Treesucon announced they had captured, photographed, and videotaped a live specimen of the species in the village of Doy in Laos.  Description  The animals look generally like rats, with thick, furred tails similar to a squirrel's, but limp. The head is large, with round ears and a somewhat bulbous bridge of the nose, and very long whiskers. Their fur is dark slate grey, with a blackish tail. The belly is lighter, with a small, whitish area in the center. Their eyes are beady and black. They are about long with a tail and weigh about . Jenkins et al. (2004) described the jaw as hystricognathous, but Dawson et al. argued it is sciurognathous. The infraorbital foramen is enlarged, consistent with a hystricomorphous zygomasseteric system. The pterygoid fossae do not connect to the orbit, setting them apart from the hystricognathous rodents.  Distribution  The Laotian Rock rat is found in limestone karsts of Khammouan Province and southern Bolikhamxai Province, Laos, and also in a small area of Minh H√≥a District, western Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province, Vietnam. In Vietnam, it is found in the 5 communes (x√£) of Th∆∞·ª£ng Ho√°, H√≥a S∆°n, Trung Ho√°, H√≥a H·ª£p, and D√¢n Ho√°, and in Phong Nha ‚Äì K·∫ª B√†ng National Park, near the villages of the Vietic-speaking Ruc, Sach, and Chut ethnic groups. It is also found directly across the border in Hin Namno National Biodiversity Conservation Area, Laos. In Laos, it is most common in the Phou Hin Poun National Biodiversity Conservation Area. Nguyen et al. suggested that the Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh and Phou Hin Poun populations may be distinct and genetically isolated from each other. Nicolas et al. found 8 major geographical clades and 8 to 16 evolutionary significant units among Laotian rock rat populations in Laos, and suggested that Laonastes may in fact consist of various undescribed cryptic species.  Natural history  Laotian rock rats are found in regions of karst limestone. They appear to be found only among limestone boulders on hillsides. Villagers in the area are familiar with the animal, calling it kha-nyou, and trapping it for food. The animals are presumed to be nocturnal. These rock rats appear to be predominantly herbivores, eating leaves, grass, and seeds. They may eat insects, as well, but probably not in high abundance. Females may give birth to a single young. Laotian rock rats appear to be quite docile and slow-moving over open ground. They walk with feet splayed outward in a gait described as duck-like. Although not ideal for mobility on open surfaces, this appears to be efficient when scrambling up and across large rocks. The sideways angle allows for greater surface area for their feet to find purchase on tilted or parallel surfaces.  See also  * Living fossil  References   Further reading  *Wilson, D.

It was contested by the Detroit Red Wings and the Philadelphia Flyers. Detroit was in the Finals for the second time in three years (the other coming in , when they lost to the New Jersey Devils) while the Flyers were making their first appearance since losing in to the Edmonton Oilers. Detroit won the series in four games to win the Stanley Cup for the eighth time in franchise history and the first time since ; Philadelphia had not won since . Detroit was the last team to win the Cup without having home ice advantage in the Finals and with fewer than 100 points earned during the regular season until . Paths to the Finals The Flyers arrived into the Finals having beaten their perennial rivals, the New York Rangers, in a memorable five-game Eastern Conference Final series. Eric Lindros and Wayne Gretzky each recorded a hat trick in the set, but the size, strength and discipline of Philadelphia trumped the veteran savvy of the Blueshirts. Philadelphia rose to the top on the back of a 17-game unbeaten streak in December and January, and despite losing the Atlantic Division title to New Jersey, had had a relatively easy time with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres in the first two rounds. Detroit was the dark horse in the Western Conference, the third seed behind the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche. The Red Wings made their second trip to the Stanley Cup Finals in three years by besting the Avalanche in an often brutal six-game Western Conference final. Even though Detroit won only 38 games, they would get star Brendan Shanahan and the departure of several players whom head coach Scotty Bowman blamed for their loss to Colorado a year prior. Previously, the Wings dispatched a fractured St. Louis Blues team and a surprising rival Mighty Ducks of Anaheim to reach the conference finals for the third straight season. This is the first time that these two teams met in the postseason. Game summaries =Game one= Game one in Philadelphia took place exactly ten years to the day after the Flyers' emotional seventh-game loss to the Edmonton Oilers in the Finals. Detroit never trailed in the game: they led 2‚Äì1 after the first period, 3‚Äì2 after the second, and Steve Yzerman scored the fourth goal 56 seconds into the third period. Sergei Fedorov scored the winner and was named the game's first star. =Game two= Brendan Shanahan scored an unassisted goal 1:37 into the game and Steve Yzerman scored a power-play goal at 9:22 of the first period to give the Red Wings a 2‚Äì0 lead before Rod Brind'Amour scored a pair of power-play goals late in the first period to tie the score. In the second, Kirk Maltby scored the game-winning goal at 2:36 and Shanahan scored his second goal of the game at 9:56 of the third and the Red Wings won a second consecutive 4‚Äì2 victory and a 2‚Äì0 series lead heading back to Joe Louis Arena. =Game three= John LeClair scored at 7:03 of the first period to give the Flyers their first lead of the series. Two minutes later, Yzerman scored on the power-play to tie the score. Fedorov scored two minutes later to put Detroit ahead for good in the game. Martin Lapointe scored later in the first to give the Wings a 3‚Äì1 advantage. The Wings tacked on two more in the second and added one in the third for a decisive 6‚Äì1 win and a three- games-to-none series advantage. For his four-point night, Fedorov was named the game's first star. In his post-game comments, Flyers head coach Terry Murray was quoted as saying the team was \\"basically in a choking situation,\\" which many observers interpreted as Murray having called out his own players as chokers. The manner in which they played compounded by the insurmountable series deficit along with the Wings' seeming dominance in stretches of the first two games as well as most of game three lent credence to the claim. =Game four= The Red Wings controlled the game from the get-go, forging ahead 1‚Äì0 after one period and employing the left-wing lock to keep the Flyers' mix of big and speedy forwards at bay. Darren McCarty's second-period tally effectively sealed the deal. The burly checker faked out Flyers rookie defenceman Janne Niinimaa inside the blue line, swooped around him, then did a quick cutback in front of Hextall in his crease to slip the puck into the net. Eric Lindros would score his lone goal of the series with 15 seconds to play. The 2‚Äì1 win brought Detroit its eighth Stanley Cup, and its first in 42 seasons. Sergei Fedorov led the Wings in playoff scoring with 20 points. Detroit goaltender Mike Vernon, who had been in net for the whole of the Wings' failed 1995 playoff run, and relegated to the bench the year before, earned vindication and his first Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP by holding Philadelphia to six goals in four games.

Aftermath On June 13, 1997, just six days after the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup, a limousine carrying Vladimir Konstantinov, team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov and Viacheslav Fetisov crashed into a tree after returning from a private party. Konstantinov spent several weeks in a coma and suffered from serious head injuries and paralysis. Fetisov, on the other hand, sustained minor injuries and Mnatsakanov suffered heavy head injuries and a coma. Fetisov continued to play, but Konstantinov did not, as the crash ended his career. The Red Wings successfully returned to the Finals. This time, the Red Wings played the Washington Capitals and swept them 4‚Äì0 to capture their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship. During the celebration ceremonies after winning the Stanley Cup, Konstantinov was wheeled around the ice with his teammates in his wheelchair with the Cup on his lap. The Philadelphia Flyers lost in the first round to the Buffalo Sabres (4‚Äì1) the next season.

Suseok at KoreanViewingStones.com; retrieved 2013-2-7. Such stones are similar to Chinese gongshi and Japanese suiseki.Brokaw, Charles. (2011). The Temple Mount Code, p. 73. Suseok can be any color. They vary widely in size ‚Äì Suseok can weigh hundreds of kilograms or much less than one kilogram. The term also refers to the stones which are placed in traditional Korean gardens. History Suseok began as votive art over 3000 years ago, and began to be seen as worthy of scholars a thousand years ago. The art usually works on three scales: large installations of monumental shaped stones as ornamental gates; medium-sized shaped stones for landscape decoration within Korean gardens; and the smaller shaped stones for scholar's tables, the most important of these scales. Chinese scholar's rocks influenced the development of suseok in Korea. Evaluation Early on, important sites within landscape were marked with shaped stones, similarly to distance markers on post roads. Burial sites were also given permanent marking by large scale tumuli or mounds, often surrounded by anthropomorphic shaped stones much akin to that of Inuit or First Nations' memory markers. The animistic belief of nature being alive, and large-scaled elements of nature having souls, has led to the continued use of massive sculpted stone in natural forms throughout Korean traditional entranceways, as the firstgrowth cedarwood traditionally used for gates is now rare. As Confucian scholarship ascended into the golden age of the Joseon dynasty, scholar rocks became an essential fixture of the writing tables of the yangban class of scholars, and a brilliant example of Confucian art.

The building originally housed the offices of the British colonial administration, and was known simply as Government Offices in its early years. In 1974 it was renamed after Sultan Abdul Samad, the reigning sultan of Selangor at the time when construction began 20 The building houses both the offices of the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia and the Ministry of Tourism and Culture of Malaysia (Malay: Kementerian Komunikasi dan Multimedia, Kementerian Pelancongan dan Kebudayaan Malaysia). It once housed the superior courts of the country: the Federal Court of Malaysia, the Court of Appeals and the High Court of Malaya. The Federal Court and the Court of Appeals had shifted to the Palace of Justice in Putrajaya during the early 2000s, while the High Court of Malaya shifted to the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex in 2007. History The building in 1902, then known simply as Government Offices =Origin and design= The government offices of the British colonial administration was originally located in the Bluff Road (present day Jalan Bukit Aman) area on a hill overlooking the Padang now called Merdeka Square. However, due to the need for more office space and complaints from the public about the necessity of going up and down the hill, the State Engineer of Selangor Public Works Department Charles Edwin Spooner proposed the building of government offices lower down at the plain. The initial suggestion was rejected due to cost, but the British Resident of Selangor William Edward Maxwell accepted a second proposal that cost less. The building was originally designed by A.C. Norman and his assistant R. A. J. Bidwell in a Classical Renaissance style, but Spooner disliked the design. It was then reworked by Bidwell under Spooner's guidance in a style variously described as Indo-Saracenic, Neo-Mughal, or Moorish. Later A. B. Hubback who had just starting working for the colonial government in Malaya as a senior draughtsman also worked on it. Although the building is formally credited to A.C. Norman (only his name appears on the foundation stone as the architect) and his ground plan was kept, the actual design is to a large extent the work of R. A. J. Bidwell, with some contributions from A. B. Hubback who also designed the fixtures of the building. View of a tower of Sultan Abdul Samad Building The building has two stories, with the floor plan roughly in the shape of the letter F with an extended top bar representing the frontage. The facade of the building faces the Padang and stretches over along Jalan Raja, at that time the largest building in Malaya. The building has wide verandas on both floors. A central clock tower is in height, and designed to echo the Big Ben but in an Indo- Saracenic style. Two lower towers flanked the clock tower, each containing a staircase. The design of these two towers may have been influenced by Muir Central College of Allahabad in India. All three towers are topped by a copper-clad onion dome. The style of the building is sometimes referred to as the \\"blood and bandages\\" style‚Äîred bricks with white plastered arches and banding. =Construction= The construction of the building began in September 1894 and was completed in 1897. The foundation stone was laid on 6 October 1894 by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Charles Mitchell. The building sits on an area of 1.034 hectares, with the floor of the building occupying an area of . The construction used 4 million bricks, 2,500 barrels of cement, 18,000 pikuls of lime, 5,000 lbs of copper, 50 tons of steel and iron, and about 30,000 cubic feet of timber. Spooner had previously established in the Brickfields area a factory for the production of large number of higher quality bricks, tiles and other building material suitable for the construction of the building. The cost of construction was 152,000 straits dollars. Spooner also made many alterations and additions while the building was being constructed with the help of A. B. Hubback. Some of these, such as an extra two and a half feet of brickwork on the lower walls, were necessary to strengthen the building due to it being built so close to the river. The height of the clock tower had also caused much concern to the public, who thought that the tower may collapse due to the ground vibrations caused by a loud signal gun fired daily at noon and 5 pm, the built tower however proved to be sturdy. A problem arose with the clock first delivered as it was not in harmony with the building, and it was replaced by a second one. The clock was manufactured by Gillett & Johnston Ltd of Croydon. =Opening= The building was completed in 1897, and a dinner was held by the Selangor Public Works Department in the building to celebrate its completion. On 4 April 1897, The building was officially opened by Sir Frank Swettenham, the General Resident of the time. A ball was held at the building, and its exterior was floodlit by gas burners, the first time such illumination was used in Kuala Lumpur. The tower chimed for the first time to coincide with Queen Victoria‚Äôs Jubilee Parade in June 1897 and has chimed since. =Extensions= The General Post Office added in 1907 The completed structure housed various important government departments during the British administration. The building, simply known as Government Offices in early Kuala Lumpur maps, housed the Federal Secretariat of the then-Federated Malay States (FMS) which was formed in 1896. The entire FMS administration‚Äîthe Public Works Department, General Post Office, District Offices, Mines Department, Lands, Audit, Treasury, Government Secretariat Offices‚Äîwas housed there. It also shared its offices with the Selangor State Government. As it was not foreseen when construction began in 1894 that Kuala Lumpur would become the capital of the Federated Malay States, the office space provided was inadequate for the need of a burgeoning bureaucracy. The FMS government took over the offices that were intended for the Sanitation Board. Other buildings and extensions were then constructed around it. A rear wing was added in 1903, and a building built in the same style was added to the south in 1907 to house the General Post Office. =Post-independence = Sultan Abdul Samad Building at night on National Day Malaya gained independence in 1957, and the Padang or field in front of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, officially renamed Dataran Merdeka (or Merdeka Square) on 1 January 1990, has become the location for the official celebration of Malayan (later Malaysian) independence since. At Dataran Merdeka, the British Union Jack was lowered for the last time at midnight on 30 August 1957 when the clock started chiming, and the Malayan flag then hoisted for the first time. Celebrations shifted to the Merdeka Stadium in the morning on 31 August with the Declaration of Independence, and Tunku Abdul Rahman became the first prime minister of Malaya. In 1974, all of the State of Selangor Government offices were relocated to Shah Alam, and the various departments of the Federal Government also moved their offices elsewhere. The building was then renamed Bangunan Sultan Abdul Samad (Sultan Abdul Samad Building) and renovated. Starting from 1978, the building housed the Court of Appeal, High Court and the Supreme Court, which was subsequently renamed the Federal Court. The Federal Court and the Court of Appeals have since moved to the Palace of Justice located in Putrajaya, the new Federal administrative capital. The building now houses the offices of the Ministry of Information, Communications and Culture of Malaysia and underwent further refurbishment. Every year, in the morning of Merdeka Day (31 August) as well as Malaysia Day (16 September), thousands of spectators converge on the city to watch the colourful parade along the streets of the city and performances held at the Merdeka Square. In 2012, the building was partly refurbished and the copper domes received a new coating of metallic paint. New colour-changing LED lights were installed to brighten up the building at night. On selected days, a section of Jalan Raja will be closed in order for the people to enjoy the night scenery of the area. Since 2007, a Merdeka (Independence) wording has been fixed at the bottom of the clock tower, a reminder of the very day of the nation's independence in 1957. Features A march past on Malaysia Day Topped by a shiny copper dome and a 41m high clock tower, it is a major landmark in the city. The clock tower houses a one-ton bell clock that strikes on the hour and half-hour. A 95-metre flagpole, one of the tallest in the world, marks that spot with a flat, round black marble plaque. It is located at the southern end of the Merdeka Square in front of the building. The building serves as the backdrop for important events such as the National Day Parade on 31 August and the ushering in of the New Year. Each of the 13 states plus the Federal Territories are represented in the National Day Parade, as are the many ethnic groups that comprise multiracial Malaysia. Behind the building flows the Klang River and Gombak River's confluence and in the middle of where the two rivers meet stands the Masjid Jamek (or Jamek Mosque), a mosque designed in similar architectural style. A close-up of the clock atop Sultan Abdul Samad Building at night, in 2013 Incidents In 1971, Kuala Lumpur suffered a huge flood after a heavy rainfall. Part of the building was not spared. In 1978, a massive renovation was undertaken. The renovation took six years to complete with a total cost of RM 17.2 million. There was also a fire which damaged part of the building. A large bronze memorial plaque commemorating fallen judicial officers and lawyers who served as volunteer soldiers in the Second World War disappeared about this time. The plaque was either looted or else was damaged in the fire but was never repaired or replaced. There is now a move supported by the Malayan Volunteers Group to try to get the bronze memorial plaque restored.

The complex is operated by Corrective Services NSW, an agency of the Department of Attorney General and Justice, of the Government of New South Wales. The complex comprises three separate correctional facilities including the John Morony Correctional Centre (a medium security correctional centre for men); the Outer Metropolitan Multi Purpose Correctional Centre (a minimum security correctional centre for men); and Dillwynia Correctional Centre (a medium security correctional centre for women). The complex accepts prisoners charged and convicted under New South Wales and/or Commonwealth legislation. Additional administrative units of Corrective Services NSW are located on-site including the Security & Intelligence Branch, the Specialised Training Unit, the Drug Detector Dog Unit and the Pre Release Programs Unit. The complex was originally named after a former commissioner, John Morony, who rose up through the ranks from a prison officer to become Comptroller General of the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. He retired in 1971 and took up a position on the New South Wales Parole Board, which he had been instrumental in setting up. The complex is built over the former boys' home \\"Daruk Training School for Boys\\". In 1960, \\"Daruk\\" Training School at Windsor was opened, and school age juvenile offenders were sent here leaving Mount Penang to train the older boys. From this time, schooling was on a voluntary basis. On 7 May 2020, the complex was renamed to the Francis Greenway Correctional Centre, named after Francis Greenway who was an English-born architect who was transported to Australia as a convict in 1814 and went on to become Australia's first government architect. John Morony Correctional Centre The John Morony Correctional Centre, an Australian low security facility for male offenders, is located within the complex. The complex has a world-famous wildlife centre which gives inmates the chance to work with the NSW Wildlife Information Rescue and Education Service (WIRES) and Sydney Metropolitan Wildlife Services, caring for injured, orphaned and sick animals. Web pages for those two services make no mention of the John Morony centre. Outer Metropolitan Multi Purpose Correctional Centre The Outer Metropolitan Multi Purpose Correctional Centre, an Australian minimum security facility for male offenders, is located within the complex. A special program unit attached to the Centre, called the RSCPA NSW ‚Äì CS NSW Dog Rehabilitation Program. This program rehabilitates dogs for re-housing and offers specialised offender educational opportunities. The Dog Rehabilitation Program is conducted under the supervision of correctional officers who also have access to training and development opportunities related to animal studies. Dillwynia Correctional Centre The Dillwynia Women's Correctional Centre, an Australian medium security facility for female offenders, is located within the complex. Dillwynia was opened in 2004 as the first purpose built female correctional facility in New South Wales and was specially constructed to meet the needs and demands of the increasing female population. The proposal to build Dillwynia had prompted great outcry from women's organisations and led to the Legislative Council inquiry 'The Select Committee on the Increase in Prisoner Population'. A special program unit is attached to the Centre, called the Greyhounds as Pets Program. This collaborative project between Corrective Services NSW and Greyhound Racing NSW rehabilitates greyhounds for re-housing and offers specialised offender educational opportunities.

Founded in 1953 as the Union Theatre Repertory Company, it is the oldest professional theatre company in Australia.Geoffrey Hutton (1975). \\"It won't last a week!\\": the first twenty years of the Melbourne Theatre Company. Melbourne: Macmillan. . The company's Southbank Theatre houses the 500-seat Sumner and the 150-seat Lawler, and the company also performs in the Arts Centre Melbourne's Fairfax Studio and Playhouse, all located in Melbourne's Arts Precinct in Southbank. Considered Victoria's state theatre company, it formally comes under the auspices of the University of Melbourne. Currently, it offers a Mainstage Season of ten to twelve plays each year, as well as education, family and creative development activities. It has a subscriber base of approximately 20,000 people and plays to a quarter of a million people annually. History The Melbourne Theatre Company was founded in 1953 by John Sumner as the Union Theatre Repertory Company, based at the Union Theatre of the University of Melbourne's Student Union building.[Julian Meyrick, ed. (2004). The Drama Continues: MTC the first fifty years 1953‚Äì2003. Southbank: Melbourne Theatre Company. .] Sumner's original idea was to present a season of plays over those months when the Union Theatre was not being used by student drama societies. It was Australia's first professional repertory theatre, presenting a new play every two weeks during the season. Later, that became three weekly repertory. The first play, Jean Anouilh's Colombe, opened on 31 August 1953, starring Zoe Caldwell (who was later to have considerable success on Broadway), George Fairfax and Alex Scott. Over the years, MTC has championed Australian writing, introducing the works of writers such as Alan Seymour, Vance Palmer, Patrick White, Alan Hopgood, Alexander Buzo, David Williamson, John Romeril, Jim McNeil, Alma De Groen, John Powers, Matt Cameron, Ron Elisha, Justin Fleming, Janis Bolodis, Hannie Rayson, Louis Nowra, Michael Gurr, Jack Davis, Michael Gow and Joanna Murray-Smith (to mention only a few) to mainstream Melbourne audiences. The first Australian play produced by the company, Summer of the Seventeenth Doll by Ray Lawler, in 1955 was quickly recognised as an Australian classic. Lawler had by that time succeeded Sumner as Director of the company, taking it through the 1955 and 1956 seasons. When Lawler left to perform The Doll in London, he handed the directorship to Wal Cherry, who oversaw the company from 1956 until 1959. Cherry's experimental and daring approach to theatre did much to broaden the tastes of Melbourne theatre-goers, though the company suffered at the box- office. In 1959, John Sumner returned and subsequently steered the company through twenty-eight years of growth, watching it become, by the time he retired in 1987, the largest theatre company in Australia. Since then the company has had three artistic directors: Roger Hodgman (1987‚Äì1999), who steered MTC through the financially troublesome period of the late 1980s and 1990s; Simon Phillips, who was Artistic Director from 2000-2011; and Brett Sheehy from 2012. Robyn Nevin, Pamela Rabe, and Aidan Fennessy managed the 2012 season in the interim between Phillips and Sheehy. The Melbourne Theatre Company has performed in many Melbourne venues in its history, including the Russell Street Theatre, the Melbourne Athenaeum, St Martins Theatre, the Merlyn and Beckett Theatres at the Malthouse, the Playhouse and Fairfax Studio of the Arts Centre Melbourne, the Comedy Theatre and the Princess Theatre.

It is situated in front of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building. Literally Independence Square, it was formerly known as the Selangor Club Padang or simply the \\"Padang\\" (meaning \\"field\\" in Malay) and was used as the cricket green of the Selangor Club (now the Royal Selangor Club). It was here the Union Flag was lowered and the Malaysian flag hoisted for the first time at midnight (time: 12:00 AM) on 31 August 1957. Since then, Merdeka Square has been the usual venue for the annual Merdeka Parade (National Day Parade). History In the early days of Kuala Lumpur, the Chinese and Malay communities settled along the east bank of the Klang River. To the west of the river was land originally owned by Yap Ah Loy and was used to plant vegetables. In 1880, the state capital of Selangor was moved from Klang to Kuala Lumpur by the colonial administration. The then British Resident William Bloomfield Douglas decided that the government buildings and staff living quarters should be located to the west of the river to keep away from what he considered the unsanitary condition of the town and the possibility of uprising from the locals. The government offices and a new police headquarter were built on Bukit Aman, with accommodation for the police located on Barrack Road (now Jalan Tangsi and part of Jalan Raja). A patch of swampy and uneven ground immediately to the west of Klang River was then levelled and drained to be used as a training ground for the police. The land was acquired from Yap by the British Resident Frank Swettenham for $50 per acre in 1882. This patch of land, originally named the Parade Ground, would become the Padang. Ten years later in 1892, the Acting British Resident Ernest Birch who was a keen cricketer then started to smooth over the ground so that it may be used as a cricket ground and other sports. The Selangor Club clubhouse was built at the present location in 1890 and the St Mary's Church was built in 1895. In 1897, the government offices were relocated from Bukit Aman to the Sultan Abdul Samad Building overlooking the Padang. The building is one of the most significant landmarks built by the British and was designed by A.C. Norman, R. A. J. Bidwell, and A. B. Hubback in an Indo-Saracenic or Neo-Mughal style of architecture. This building housed the Selangor State Secretariat and later the Supreme Court before the court was moved, and the building was left unused for a few years. It now houses the Ministry of Heritage, Culture and Arts. As the Sultan Abdul Samad Building was designed and its construction began before Kuala Lumpur became the capital of the Federated Malay States, it became it inadequate for the use of a burgeoning bureaucracy when it was made the capital. Many buildings were then constructed near it around the Padang. A printing office was constructed in 1899 on the southwest corner of the Padang, the town hall to the northeast in 1904, the FMS Railway offices to the southeast in 1905, the General Post Office south of the Sultan Abdul Samad Building in 1907, the Survey Department building in 1910 and the Supreme Court in 1915 in the northeast area. As the Padang is located in front of the government offices, it is used for many national and civic events. The Padang was once leased to the Selangor Club which used it for various sports such as cricket and rugby. In 1987, the Padang was taken back by City Hall and in return, the Selangor Club was given a piece of land in Bukit Kiara. On the midnight of 30 August 1957, the British flag was lowered and the Malayan flag was raised for the first time at the Padang, an event watched by a large number of people there. In the morning of 31 August 1957, the ceremony for Malayan independence was then held at the Merdeka Stadium. The Padang was renamed 'Dataran Merdeka' or Merdeka Square in October 1989. It was done in conjunction with the Visit Malaysia Year 1990 campaign beginning 1 January 1990. On 31 August 2007, Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi shouted 'Merdeka!' on midnight celebrations, where thousands of Malaysians celebrated 50 years of nationhood. BBC NEWS, Malaysia marks 50 years as nation  Notable buildings and features  A 95-metre flagpole, one of the tallest in the world, is located at the southern end of the square. A flat, round black marble plaque marks the location where the Malayan flag was raised for the first time. Near the flagpole at the corner of the Padang is a fountain, the Cop's Fountain, built in 1897 as a memorial to Steve Harper, a popular police inspector. A car park and retail area, the Plaza Putra which was later renamed Plaza Dataran Merdeka, was built beneath the Merdeka Square; however, the location had been affected by flooding. Surrounding the square are many buildings of historical interest. Just beside the square is the Sultan Abdul Samad Building currently the office of the Ministry of Information, Communication and Culture of Malaysia. Opposite the square is the Royal Selangor Club which was first founded in 1884 as a meeting place for high-ranking members of the British colonial society. To the South is the former National History Museum which used to house a vast collection of historical items. The collection has recently been moved to Muzium Negara. Next to it is the Kuala Lumpur City Gallery which tells the story of Kuala Lumpur through miniature models and The Spectacular City Model Show. To the North is the St. Mary's Anglican Cathedral, currently the Diocese of West Malaysia and the see of the Bishop of West Malaysia.

He saw the gospel and Catholic social teaching as a means of empowering the poor. Ratzinger was a pupil at the gymnasium at Passau during the years 1855‚Äì63, studied theology at Munich, 1863‚Äì67, and was ordained priest in 1867. In 1868 he received the degree of Doctor of Theology at Munich. During the following years he devoted himself partly to pastoral, partly to journalistic work. In 1869 he was chaplain at Berchtesgaden; 1870‚Äì71 he was editor of the journal \\"Fr√§nkisches Volksblatt\\" at W√ºrzburg; 1872‚Äì74, chaplain at Landshut, then editor, until 1876, of the \\"Volksfreund\\", at Munich. He was a member of the Parliament of Bavaria from 1875 to 1878 and of the German Reichstag from 1877 to 1878. During this period he belonged to the Centre Party. He combined the roles of priest and politician in a way which his grandnephew, Pope Benedict XVI, rejected. With exception of a pastorate of three years at G√ºnzelhafen, 1885‚Äì1888, he lived for a number of years at Munich, where he devoted himself to journalism and research. In 1893 Ratzinger was again elected to the Bavarian Landtag, where he was now a moderate adherent of the \\"Bayerischer Bauernbund\\" (Bavarian Peasant Union) party, his views of social politics having caused him in the meantime to sever his connections with the Centre Party. In 1898 he was again elected a member of the Reichstag. He remained a member of both bodies until his death. As a literary man Ratzinger deserves much credit for his scholarly work in political economy and in historical subjects. His chief works, distinguished by erudition, richness of thought, and animated exposition, are: \\"Geschichte der Armenpflege\\" (prize essay, Freiburg, 1868, 2nd revised ed., 1884); \\"Die Volkswirtschaft in ihren sittlichen Grundlagen. Ethnischsociale Studien √ºber Cultur und Civilisation (Freiburg, 1881; 2nd. completely revised ed., 1895). The later work maintains the ethical principles of Christianity as the only sure basis of political economy and opposes the materialistic system of what is called the \\"classical political economy\\" of Adam Smith. \\"Forschungen zur bayerischen Geschichte\\" (Kempten, 1898) contains a large number of studies on early Bavarian history and on the history of civilization, based on a series of unconnected treatises, which had first appeared in the \\"Historisch- politische Bl√§tter\\". Of his smaller works the following should be mentioned: \\"Das Concil und die deustche Wissenschaft\\" (anonymously issued at Mainz, 1872) appeared first in the \\"Katholik\\", 1872, I; \\"Die Erhaltung des Bauernstandes\\" (Freiburg, 1883). His nephew was the police officer Joseph Ratzinger, Sr., father of Pope Benedict XVI (born Joseph Ratzinger) and Georg Ratzinger, the priest and church musician.

She governed Castile as regent from 1406 until 1418 during the minority of her son. Queen Catherine was the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, and his second wife, Constance of Castile (the daughter and heir of King Peter of Castile, who died at the hands of his half brother Henry II). She was born in Hertford Castle, her father's chief country home, on 31 March 1373.It is possible that she was not born 31 March 1373, but rather 6 June 1372 (L. Vones: \\"Katharina 3\\" in Lexikon des Mittelalters (Dictionary of the Middle Ages). Vol. 5, col. 1070.) Catherine became Queen of Castile through her marriage to Henry III. Marriage After King John I of Portugal defeated King John I of Castile at the Battle of Aljubarrota, South Leiria, in 1385, fully establishing Portuguese independence, Catherine's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Lancaster, were encouraged to press their claim for the Castilian throne.Lopes, Fern√£o. The English in Portugal, 1367-1287. P 227-237 In 1386, Catherine joined her parents in an expedition to Castile to claim the throne. England and Portugal entered into an alliance against Castile in 1386 and solidified their ties through the marriage of King John I and Catherine's half-sister, Philippa. John of Gaunt had ruled Santiago de Compostela, Vigo, and Pontevedra with ease, but had to withdraw to Portugal in 1387 because of an unsuccessful invasion of Le√≥n. It was then that he accepted the proposal of King John I of Castile, to marry Catherine to his son, the future Henry III, and that Constance, Duchess of Lancaster, should renounce all claims to the Castilian throne. A final treaty in regards to this proposal was ratified at Bayonne in Gascony on 8 July 1388. The marriage helped to restore a semblance of legitimacy to the Trast√°mara line. Furthermore, together with the Truce of Leulingham and the one made at Mon√ß√£o Municipality, the betrothal helped to end the Spanish period of the Hundred Years War.MacKay, Angus. Spain in the Middle Ages : From Frontier to Empire, 1000‚Äì1500. New York : St. Martin's Press, 1977. On 5 August 1388, the 15-year- old Catherine announced that she entered into the marriage freely and fully accepted the treaty. The treaty had included a dower of the towns of Soria, Almaz√°n, Atienza, Deza, and Molina. By 17 September 1388, Catherine was married to the nine-year-old Henry in Palencia Cathedral. Her husband took over the throne after the death of his father in 1390, but only in 1393 was he declared of age and began to rule. Catherine's only contribution to Henry's rule was the bearing of his three children and her devotion to the religious patronage of the Dominican Order. In September 1390, Catherine accepted the authority of the Avignon Papacy, under Antipope Clement VII and became a staunch supporter. The couple's three children: * Maria of Castile (1401‚Äì1458), who married Alfonso V \\"the Magnanimous\\", King of Aragon and Naples, without issue * Catherine of Castile (1403/1406‚Äì1439), who wed as his first wife in 1420 Henry of Aragon, 4th Count of Alburquerque, 32nd Count of Ampurias and 35th Master of the Order of Santiago (1400-Calatayud, 1445), without issue * John II (1405‚Äì1454), who succeeded his father as King of Castile. Widowhood =Regency with Ferdinand= Henry III died in 1406, and according to his will, his widow, Catherine, and his brother, Ferdinand I of Aragon were to be joint regents during John II's minority, sharing their power with a royal council. Of those three parties, Ferdinand was to be the one with the greatest share of power. However, the custody of John II was given to two nobles, Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga and Juan Fernandez de Velasco. Catherine prepared to defend herself and her household in a famous Spanish castle, the Alc√°zar of Segovia, because she was not willing to relinquish her year-old son. Ferdinand was eventually able to make a deal that allowed Catherine to maintain custody of her son. Depiction of Catherine in the 15th century \\"Geneaology of the Kings of Spain\\" Ferdinand ordered Mud√©jars (Muslims living in Christian Spain) to wear a symbol; a blue moon on their clothing. They were not allowed to leave their homes, nor were they allowed to work or trade with Christians. The Jews, too, were not allowed to work or trade with Christians. This was an attempt by John II to suppress religious minorities, which was supported by Catherine and only lasted until her death. Furthermore, tensions between the regents led to a division of rule. The royal council awarded Catherine control over the Northern part of the Kingdoms of Castile, and Leon. As Catherine became increasingly involved in the wars of Ferdinand against Granada in the south, Castile's alliance with France suffered and she was able to strengthen her relations with Portugal, where her half-sister Philippa was queen, and with England, where her half-brother Henry IV ruled since 1399. Catherine and her half-brother fostered the trade between Castile and England. Her international policies were beneficial to the Castilian communities, but her co-regents did not always act in their best interests. Because of Catherine's opposition to Ferdinand, she supported the position of Antipope Benedict XIII and initially spoke up against the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì1418). =Second regency= When Ferdinand died in 1416, Catherine's authority was reduced, because his rivals no longer supported her. The government became very conciliar. Catherine, sickly due to a stroke, relinquished the custody of her son. There is one vivid account of Catherine towards the end of her life recorded by Fern√°n P√©rez de Guzm√°n. It alludes to the fact that she probably inherited physical characteristics from her father, and that she was a sickly woman. He describes her as being very tall and fat, pink with white in her complexion and fair. He states that she moved as though she was a man. He also says that she was virtuous and reserved, in both her person and her reputation. She was said to be generous and magnificent in her ways, although she did play \\"favourites\\" and was greatly influenced by them. Despite her \\"favouritism\\", she was twice as likely to banish women from her household. Death and burial Catherine's tomb Queen Catherine died at Valladolid on 2 June 1418, of a stroke, leaving her thirteen-year-old son at the mercy of self-interested courtiers. She is buried with her husband in the Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos in Cathedral of Toledo. Her monumental effigy shows her with a long face and a highly arched forehead. Catherine of Lancaster's great-granddaughter Catherine of Aragon, the first of the six wives of Henry VIII, was named after her.

This town is an important trading centre for fish and fish manure. Fishing and Beedi rolling are main occupations of the residents of this town. History The popular Ullal Bridge, Mangalore Ullal - Thokottu Road, Mangalore Ullal highrise buildings, Mangalore This town was the subsidiary capital of the Chowta rulers and was ruled by Jain Queen, Abbakka Chowta in the middle of the 16th century. Abbakka Chowta of Ullal can perhaps be proclaimed the first promoter of women‚Äôs liberation. A regular firebrand, the people of Ullal look upon her with much pride. A Jain princess of 16th century, she came to the throne on the death of her sister. She was married to the King of Mangalore, but the marriage was not a success. In a few years the couple was estranged with the queen returning to her beloved Ullal. The reason for the grouse was, the queen was averse to the payment of subsidy demanded by the Portuguese. While her husband continued to be subservient to them, the queen was openly rebellious. Relations between the royal couple steadily worsened and finally ended with divorce, with the queen returning all the jewels to her ex-husband. War was declared and the queen was captured while on a sailing expedition on the Nethravathi. Taken prisoner she was presented before her husband. However, on this one occasion the queen thought discretion the better part of valour and with all her womanly charms got the Banga Arasa (King) to set her free and return all her lands to her. The Raja went so far as to avow his eternal friendship to her. But hardly had she reached the precincts of her own kingdom then she vowed to wage war on her husband once more. For this she sought the help of the powerful Raja of Bednore. The Banga Raja had meanwhile enlisted the help of the Portuguese to subjugate his wife. The Raja of Bednore being an opportunist was only too ready to enter the fray. The Banga-Portuguese alliance was defeated with the Banga Fort razed to the ground. The queen had to part with the fertile tract of land at Berdatte to the Bednore King for his support. Having successfully defeated her husband, the queen now turned her attention to the Portuguese with whom she maintained her unconciliatory attitude. Several punitive expeditions were sent against her, which she repulsed successfully with the help of the Zamorin of Calicut. Another expedition sent under Jo√£o Peixoto in 1566 ended in disaster for the Portuguese. The queen along with Chennappa Mogaveera (Gurikara) as commander-in-chief and Mogaveera warriors she surrounded the Portuguese frigate at night. She took them by surprise and inflicted a crushing defeat on them. Incensed by the defeat made all the more insulting at the hands of a woman, the Portuguese sent a veritable armada under the leadership of the Portuguese Governor himself. While the queen met with initial success, she was betrayed, so some say, by her own people for a casket of silver. However, the army of the queen was thoroughly outnumbered. What ensured was a bloody massacre with the queen escaping to the hills, a fugitive. Another version has it that the queen had killed herself rather than give herself up to the enemy which really seems more in keeping with her character. Pietro Della Valle, a renowned traveller and historian of the 16th century, seems to have been fascinated by her. Her militant nature aroused his interest and he made several attempts to meet her. His efforts finally met with success when he accidentally came across her in the bazaar. His foreign mein and dress elicited her interest and with the aid of an interpreter, courtesies were exchanged and an invitation issued to visit the royal palace. Della Valle was enamoured of \\"her perfect dignity, handsome feature and exemplary assiduity. Active and vigorous in actions of war and weighty affairs. Even at night she was not free to take rest but dispensed justice to her people.\\" His description of her is at once romantic and realistic. He puts her age down at 40, dark complexioned and with elegant figure. At another instance, he says she could be mistaken for a common kitchen wench, but for her graceful and judicious speech. Her scanty clothing of only a loincloth may have created this impression. He seems highly impressed with her administrative qualities and doesn‚Äôt give much credence to the rumours of her having poisoned her elder two sons, who were aspiring to the throne. One can see the ruins of the fort she built around Somanatheshwara temple. This temple houses few things related to the Abbakka Chowta. There is an old Jain temple (basadi) in the town which belonged to the queen.

He painted coastal scenes, and his finest works are considered to be those painted in Brittany in 1929 and during his second trip to Brittany in 1930 when he painted fewer marine pictures and more churches. He claimed that his \\"mother's people were Cornish and that he got his love of the sea and for boats from his Cornish ancestry\\".Wertheim, Lucy [1947]. Adventure in Art, Nicholson and Watson, London, p. 9 In April 1929 Wood held a solo exhibition at Tooth's Gallery in Bond Street, London where he met Lucy Wertheim at a private view. She purchased a picture and soon became one of his biggest supporters, buying up his work. For his part Wood apparently appreciated the support, telling Wertheim at her birthday party that: In May 1930 he had a largely unsuccessful exhibition with Nicholson at the Georges Bernheim Gallery in Paris. In June and July he made a second sojourn to Brittany to create new work. Later in July Wertheim travelled to meet Wood in Paris, to choose the paintings for a one-man show that would be the opening exhibition at her new Wertheim Gallery in October. While discussing the exhibition over lunch the day after her arrival, Wood issued her with an ultimatum: \\"I want you to promise to guarantee me twelve hundred pounds a year from the time of my exhibition, one hundred pounds a month being the least I can live on. If I can't have this sum I've made up my mind to shoot myself\\". When she complained, he begged her forgiveness, and they went to review the paintings again. Following his death in August the show was cancelled; it was eventually staged as a memorial show at another gallery.Wertheim, Lucy [1947]. Adventure in Art, Nicholson and Watson, London, pp. 12‚Äì19 = Personal life = Wood was bisexual. In the early summer of 1921, Wood met Jos√© Antonio Gandarillas Huici (1887‚Äì1970), a Chilean diplomat. Gandarillas, a married homosexual fourteen years older than Wood, lived a glamorous life partly financed by gambling. Their relationship lasted through Wood's life, surviving his affair with Jeanne Bourgoint. In 1927 his plans to elope and marry heiress Meraud Guinness were frustrated by her parents whereupon he required emotional support from Winifred Nicholson. (Meraud went on to marry Chilean painter √Ålvaro Guevara in 1929.) Wood also had a liaison with a Russian √©migr√©e, Frosca Munster, whom he met in 1928.Margaret Garlake, ‚ÄòWood, (John) Christopher [Kit] (1901‚Äì1930)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 =Death and commemoration= By 1930, painting frenetically in preparation for his Wertheim exhibition in London, Wood became psychotic and began carrying a revolver. On 21 August he travelled to meet his mother and sister for lunch at 'The County Hotel' in Salisbury and to show them a selection of his latest paintings. After saying goodbye he jumped under a train at Salisbury railway station, although in deference to his mother's wishes it was reported as an accident. Christopher Wood is buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church in Broad Chalke. His gravestone was carved by fellow artist and sculptor Eric Gill. Although his planned exhibition at the Wertheim gallery was cancelled on his death, a posthumous exhibition was held in February 1931. This was followed by an exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery in 1932. The 1938 Venice Biennale included some of his paintings, and later the Redfern Gallery (part of the New Burlington Galleries) compiled a major retrospective.

(The following two novels are Fifty Degrees Below (2005) and Sixty Days and Counting (2007).) Robinson has been nicknamed the \\"Master of Disaster\\" for his description of natural disasters based partly on the contents of this book. Plot introduction The focus of the novel is the effects of global warming in the early decades of the 21st century. Its characters are mostly scientists, either involved in biotech research, assisting government members, or doing paperwork at the National Science Foundation (NSF). There are also several Buddhist monks working for the embassy of the fictional island nation of Khembalung. Characters Anna Quibler ‚Äì a hard-scientist administrator in charge of the Bioinformatics Division at the NSF; part of her job entails farming out grant proposals from scientists and science students nationwide to program directors under her supervision. She befriends the Khembalis. Charlie Quibler ‚Äì Anna's husband, a stay-at-home dad taking care of their young sons. He is the science policy advisor to Senator Phil Chase and works tirelessly to introduce bills to Congress for climate change mitigation. Frank Vanderwal ‚Äì a University of California, San Diego biomathematician with an interest in sociobiology, working for a year at the NSF; he oversees review of biology grant proposals. A rock climbing hobbyist and co-founder of Torrey Pines Generique. Drepung ‚Äì a Tibetan Buddhist monk, he identifies himself to Anna as the assistant and translator for Rudra Cakrin, but is revealed later in the series to be the spiritual leader of the Khembalese. Rudra Cakrin ‚Äì embassador from Khembalung to the United States; a Tibetan in exile, he pretends to be the spiritual leader of the Khembalese but is actually Drepung's assistant. Leo Mulhouse ‚Äì chief science researcher at Torrey Pines Generique, working on gene therapy. Senator Phil Chase ‚Äì a Democratic Senator from California, he understands the need for both policy change and Realpolitik; a character in Antarctica. Diane Chang ‚Äì Head of the National Science Foundation. Plot Frank Vanderwal, having spent a year at the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Washington, D.C., is impatient with what he sees as its passivity and its reluctance to demand serious political change in the face of severe climate change. He keeps an eye on environmental triggers such as climate change in the Arctic and thermohaline circulation. Though he likes his colleague, Anna Quibler, and much of her work, he misses his hometown, San Diego. An athletic man, he frequently goes climbing and canyoneering when he can. Interested in sociobiology, he views both his own behavior and others' as that of primates who evolved on the African savannahs and who are not entirely biologically prepared to live in the urban environment. He considers behaviors in ordinary situations, such as traffic, and in extraordinary situations in light of the game theory decision making strategy known as the prisoner's dilemma. Anna's husband, Charlie Quibler, feels as urgently as Frank does about environmental issues. He juggles the raising of their two young sons, Nick and Joe, with encouraging Senator Phil Chase and Chase's chief of staff, Roy, to badger the conservatives in Congress about passing legislation to convert the United States to a non-anthropogenic global warming society, to construct carbon sinks, and to work for international cooperation for amelioration of climate change. (It is clear that the President, never named, is George W. Bush; we are told that his predecessor was Bill Clinton; he views climate change as a \\"downer\\" and refers to it as \\"climactic [not climatic] terrorism.\\") Anna, a devoted wife and mother, is, in Frank's view, something of an ultra- rationalist; Charlie is amused by her constant search for quantifiable measurements in all parts of her life. She discovers the new Khembali embassy in the NSF building and invites Drepung and Rudra Cakrin to lunch. When they all get along well, and she becomes interested in their concern about the threat of rising sea levels to Khembalung, their small island nation in the Bay of Bengal, she invites them to come for dinner when they all have time. Leo Mulhouse, a science director at Torrey Pines Generique, a biotechnology startup company in San Diego, searches for therapies for various human diseases. He is alarmed to learn that his boss, Derek, has spent $51 million to buy another company which might (and might not) work in tandem; Torrey Pines has not yet been able to show any profits, which puts them at risk for sale to investors who might care to purchase or even quash any patentable techniques they come up with. He turns out to be right when the company is sold some weeks later. Leo has another worry: his house, located on a cliff over the Pacific, is threatened by coastal erosion. Frank, eager to return to California, writes an angry denunciation of NSF and leaves it in the in-box of the director, Diane Chang, for her to find the next morning. That evening, he unexpectedly has a romantic encounter with a beautiful woman in a Washington Metro subway elevator when the elevator is stuck between floors. They are released, and she disappears before he can learn her name. Invited to the Quiblers' house to meet the Khembalis, he tells Anna about the woman; she is pleased to find him so excited and talkative, and urges him to track her down. Frank, thinking that now he might want to stay in D.C., regrets the angry letter about the NSF and decides to break into Chang's office and remove it. Using his climbing skills, he enters the NSF building from the roof, descends through the atrium skylight, manages his way down a large mobile, and gets into Chang's office. The letter, however, is gone; Chang often comes into her office at all hours. Nervous and upset, he returns home. The next day, Chang tells him to prepare a talk for the NSF Board of Directors. Frank realizes that Chang has read his letter, but he tells the directors honestly how he feels about the NSF and urges them to become more daring and more politically active. During the discussion, he sees that many of them feel as he does. Frank accepts an invitation to remain at NSF for another year. A catastrophic \\"trigger event\\" occurs when what Robinson calls the Hyperni√±o creates an enormous storm on the West Coast. The sandstone cliffs of California begin shelving off into the Pacific Ocean. Leo, now unemployed, witnesses this at his Leucadia, California home and, in the rainstorm, joins members of the United States Geological Survey and an army of volunteers in attempting to shore up the cliffs. Meanwhile, another enormous storm in the Atlantic creates a flood in Washington. Charlie is trapped at the Capitol Building with other co-workers. They watch as the rain comes down for hours and the National Mall is drowned. \\"Constitution Avenue looked like the Grand Canal in Venice.\\" The Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay overflow, flooding the city: When the National Zoo faces rising waters, the Khembalis help the staff to unlock the cages and free the animals. Drepung and his associates arrange for two tigers to be brought to the Quiblers' house, where one is kept in a zoo truck and the other is put into their cellar. Frank, joining other volunteers in deploying sandbags out in the storm, is amazed to see his mystery woman pass in a boat up the river. Spotting the boat's number, he gets her phone number and calls her; she promises that, after a while, she will call him back. After days, the storm and the floodwaters subside.

J. Killheffer in his review for Fantasy & Science Fiction said \\"Forty Signs of Rain is a fascinating depiction of the workings of science and politics, and an urgent call for us to pull our heads from the sand and confront the threat of climate change. We should listen.\\" The reviewer for SF Site was also interested in the scientific themes, calling the novel \\"one of the most chilling\\" and \\"one of the most important and thought provoking books\\" she had read that year: \\"Greed is the key, here, and it's a tragedy. ... This book is a wake up call of sorts, to scientists in the United States especially, to go out and fight for what they believe in.\\" Kirkus Reviews was critical, saying, \\"As stiff and hard SF as they were, the Mars books succeeded through the sheer chutzpah of their epic insight. This one feels like the ho- hum preview for a run-of-the-mill end-of-the-world story.\\" Publishers Weekly said, \\"Robinson's tale lacks the drama and excitement of such other novels dealing with global climate change as Bruce Sterling's Heavy Weather and John Barnes' Mother of Storms, but his portrayal of how actual scientists would deal with this disaster-in-the-making is utterly convincing. Robinson clearly cares deeply about our planet's future, and he makes the reader care as well.\\" Lara Apps wrote, \\"The result is a slow-building, educational and entertaining introduction to what promises to be a provocative and exciting trilogy.\\" Jerry Wright, admitting that Robinson's \\"politics leave me cold,\\" concluded, \\"Robinson seems to focus on details of the characters' lives, their work, and their thoughts, but behind it all, the specter of global warming looms. Soon there is a change here, a change there, until all the imbalances combine to bring about a catastrophe that who knows, might even wake up the DC politicians. KSR outlines quite a plausible scenario, and the science behind the troubles seem accurate.\\" Awards and nominations *Nominated for both the British Science Fiction Award, in 2004; and the Locus Award in 2005.

Completed in 1910 to replace an older station on the same site, the station was Kuala Lumpur's railway hub in the city for the Federated Malay States Railways and its successor Keretapi Tanah Melayu (English: Malayan Railways), before Kuala Lumpur Sentral assumed much of its role in 2001. The station is notable for its architecture, adopting a mixture of Eastern and Western designs. The station is located along a road named Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin, previously known as Victory Avenue, which in turn was part of Damansara Road. The station is located closely to the similarly designed Railway Administration Building, as well as the National Mosque and Dayabumi Complex. The Pasar Seni station is located 400 metres away, across the Klang River. History =Preceding stations= Prior to the construction of the current Kuala Lumpur station, two stations were already operational in the city. The first railway station in Kuala Lumpur, nicknamed Resident Station due to its proximity to the residence of British High Commissioner, was completed and located opposite to the Selangor Club (today Dataran Merdeka) towards the west. Constructed of wood and a nipah palm roof, the station was the first in Kuala Lumpur, linking Kuala Lumpur to Klang (Pengkalan Batu) via the first railway line to connect the city with the rest of the Malay Peninsula (officially inaugurated 22 September 1886). The second station, Sultan Street station, was constructed in 1892 at Foch Avenue (now Tun Tan Cheng Lock Road), close to the present Maybank Tower, the Puduraya bus station and Plaza Rakyat. Its design was based on Resident Station, and was stationed along the Pudu railway line, a new line that branched off north from the 1910 station, and connected mines from Ampang to the city. The line was unique in that the initial leg of the track approaching Sultan Street Station from the main line was sandwiched between two carriageways of Foch Avenue, cutting across the east side of the city. Resident Station was demolished after construction of the new Kuala Lumpur station was completed. Meanwhile, Sultan Street Station was replaced by a smaller terminal station when the tracks at Foch Avenue were dismantled for road traffic, and was demolished after 1960. The Ampang-linked route is partially reused by the LRT Ampang line. =Design, construction and operation= Arthur Benison Hubback, a British Architectural Assistant to the Director of Public Works, undertook the design of the station. He incorporated the unique Anglo-Asian architecture in the region on the station's design. The \\"Neo-Moorish/Mughal/Indo-Saracenic/Neo-Saracenic\\" style was not uncommon at the time. Similar structures, such as the Sultan Abdul Samad Building (designed by A.C. Norman, completed 1897), the Old City Hall (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1904) and the Jamek Mosque (designed by A.B. Hubback, completed 1909), pre-date Kuala Lumpur station. At a cost of $23,000, the station was completed and operational on 1 August 1910. After the demolition of Resident Station and the isolation of Sultan Street station, the Kuala Lumpur station became the main railway station in Kuala Lumpur. A railway hotel, the Station Hotel (later renamed the Heritage Station Hotel in 1996), occupied the northern sections of the central station and the upper floors of the station, boasting 170 rooms and an ornate lobby housing Charlies Restaurant & Bar as off the late-2000s. In 1995, access to KTM Komuter services was introduced at the station. The interior of the station's main hall was refurbished in 1986, which saw some of its original interiors altered and modernised. The area is now used to house exhibits (such as this model of a carriage) after the station was designated a railway museum. After the diversion of long-distance intercity rail traffic less than a kilometer south to Kuala Lumpur Sentral on 15 April 2001, the original station's importance diminished. While intercity trains continue to pass the station, they no longer stop there, relegating the station to being a stop for Komuter and goods services. As a result of declining passenger traffic and patronage, redundant station facilities, such as manned ticket counters for intercity services, station offices and rented businesses spaces, were decommissioned or slowly vacated. The Heritage Station Hotel ceased operation in 2011 following declining patronage and a series of mismanaged renovations in the late-2000s; the hotel was briefly reopened in 2014 before closing the same year.‚ÄúA loss to K.L‚Äù. https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/ShowUserReviews-g298570-d637810-r263673793-Heritage_Station_Hotel- Kuala_Lumpur_Wilayah_Persekutuan.html While the side platforms of the original station, which have already been raised to a leveled height for smooth embarking and disembarking for intercity coaches, were readily usable from KTM Komuter trains, the configuration of the island platform and access to services in the first 15 years of the Komuter's service meant that the original station could not be maximised for use as a transportation stop for electric trains until 2009 renovations raised the last of the original platforms (see platform). In the months leading up to 31 August 2007, the 50th anniversary of Malaya's independence, various sources reported the transfer of various old railway equipment from a railway warehouse in Klang and a few other locations to the old Kuala Lumpur station. This included a small restored shunter and an antique fire engine. The station was officially reopened on 31 August 2007 as a railway museum (where exhibitions are placed in the main hall and platform of the station), and was mooted to be converted into a cultural centre. =Renovations, upgrades and changes= KTM Komuter Class 92 and Class 83 trains waiting at the newer wing of Kuala Lumpur station, built during the 1986 refurbishment. The station has undergone several major changes in its modern history. The north wing was converted for office use by 1967, closing off the arched verandahs with windows. In 1986, the station was more extensively refurbished, with the interior and relevant windows replaced with modern counterparts while the exterior was repaired and preserved, and additional new facilities and buildings, including air- conditioned waiting halls, tourism information counters and snack bars. Parts of the station's original interior designs and frames are still present in the Heritage Station Hotel. The refurbishment also saw an additional extension built on the south wing of the building, sporting \\"Raj\\" stylings that dominates much of the building, and the addition of a frontal fa√ßade for the north wing that sports similar architectural elements, masking hints of Western designs from the front. These changes resulted in the building sporting two additional chhatris, two on the corner of each wing, alongside the original four. The 1986 renovation also extended the old station's frontal facade, with the existing northern wing masked by a \\"Raj\\"-styled edifice. Kuala Lumpur - stationboard Other modifications made onto the old building included the rear wall of the station carved open and extended to accommodate a new station entrance, taxi stops, several office and retail spaces, while additional double-storey retail spaces were constructed over one of the two adjacent frontal access roads to the main building. The 1986 remodelling also saw platform extensions to the north and a new station building in the area, which connected to the General Post Office at the then newly completed Dayabumi Complex (constructed 1982 to 1984). When KTM Komuter services were launched in 1995 to serve the Rawang-Seremban Route and the Sentul-Port Klang Route, ticket counters and faregates were added to the station, in common with other KTM Komuter stations. The location of Komuter facilities meant that only the newer island platform could be used by KTM Komuter trains (see platform). After Kuala Lumpur Sentral assumed the responsibility of receiving intercity operations, portions of station facilities designated for intercity services were decommissioned or removed. Limited intercity services were reintroduced to the station following the station's designation as an ETS stop in 2009. Platforms The station contains three platforms serving four railway tracks, consisting of two side platforms (platforms 1 and 4) on both sides and one island platform (platforms 2 and 3) in between. The numbered designations originally applied to the lengths of both the original and extended platforms from the 1986 renovation until the introduction of Komuter in 1995, when extensions of the original platforms 2 and 3 were assigned additional \\"a\\" suffixes, i.e. platforms 2a and 3a, while designations for platforms 1 and 4 remain unchanged. When the station originally opened in 1910 all platforms were elevated relative to the tracks but were lower than the train floor; all platforms were connected by two tunnels, respectably accessible via stairways for passengers or ramps for trolleys. The 1986 renovation, which added extended platforms elevated to the level of the train floor, had also partially raised the old side platforms to match the height of the 1986 platforms (the tunnel entrances were unaffected by the remodelling as they were located well away from the platform edges), but left the height of the old island platform largely unchanged. As a result, platforms 2 and 3 were unprepared to deal with passengers entering and exiting Komuter trains. In anticipation of the introduction of longer ETS and Komuter EMUs, renovation works were conducted in 2009 to raise platforms 2 and 3, removing century-old surface-level tunnel railings and sealing off the stairway exit from one of the tunnels to platforms 2 and 3. Larger capony shelters connecting the old and new train sheds were also added in 2006. The platforms have been designated the following functions: * Until Intercity services moved to Kuala Lumpur Sentral in 2001, platforms 1 and 4 were typically assigned to service Intercity trains. As such, ticket counters for the train services were located within the old and new station buildings. When passenger traffic at the platforms ceased after 2001, the platforms continued to be used to transfer goods to and from trains. The side platforms, like the lobby of the old station building, were open to the public between 2001 and 2011, as Komuter faregates were located at the old island platform rather than within the station building. Following renovations in 2009, the platforms were repurposed for use by the ETS in 2011 with tickets sold at counters located in the former railway fan clubhouse. * Like the side platforms, the island platforms (platforms 2 and 3, including the 1986 extension) originally served as platforms for Intercity trains services. When Komuter services were introduced in 1995, the 1986 stretch of the island platform was renumbered to platforms 2a and 3a, to be reassigned for trains serving the Rawang-Seremban and Sentul- Port Klang Routes. Due to the still low height of the old island platform, Komuter trains could not stop at the original stretch of platforms 2 and 3, and as such ticket faregates for Komuter services were installed towards the northern end of platforms 2 and 3 to the south as well as the modern exit for platforms 2a and 3a to the north. This also left the original platforms 2 and 3 disused following the discontinuation of intercity services in 2001. With the old island platform raised following the 2009 platform renovation, Komuter and ETS trains could stop along the entire stretch of platforms 2 and 3, moving the southern faregates away from the old platform and into the old station building. Architecture The frontal design of the station is comparable with that of local buildings in the same architectural style, such as the Railway Administration Building directly across the road (left) and various administrative buildings around Merdeka Square. When originally completed in 1910, the Kuala Lumpur railway station consisted of a main terminal building at the front and three platforms serving four railway tracks at the back. The main structure, which contains a main hall, ticket counters, railway offices and the railway hotel, is primarily designed in a \\"Raj\\" styling, mixture of Western and Mughal similar to Moorish Revival or Indo- Saracenic architecture. Dominated by horseshoe and ogee arches, and large chhatris (six originally, with two added later) at the corners of the building accompanying smaller variations at the front, the station is comparable to its contemporaries like the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, surrounding structures constructed around the Merdeka Square and the Railway Administration Building directly across the street. In addition to the main station building, a three- storey addition at the north wing was added early in its operation, adopting more Westernised vernacular designs with surrounding venrendahs and segmental arches of various widths. The fa√ßade of the station is completely plastered, as opposed to buildings of similar styles that opt for exposed brickwork, and painted in light colours (usually white or cream) throughout its service. The platforms are covered by large steel-framed shelters, which were initially shorter during the station's early operation. The roofs were originally glazed, and were partially opened to allow smoke from steam locomotives to escape; corrugated roof sheets served as replacements later in the station's life. The sides of the platforms not adjoining the main building are surrounded by walls constructed in the same style as the main building. The platforms and main building are linked to each other via two underground passageways. The design of the extended platform for the 1986 refurbishment of the station took a more modernist approach, consisting simply of large concrete pillars supporting a latticed roof and a ticket office on concrete slabs at the north end, suspended two stories above ground. White walls and arches that serve as decorations to the extension mimic design cues from both the old station and the Dayabumi complex. The new extension is also connected to Dayabumi via an elevated walkway.

Apart from each of the MLB teams, the game also features teams made up with legends of different eras and the 2004 American and National league teams. One particular game charasteristic is that it includes the Montreal Expos, which changed their name to the Washington Nationals for the 2005 MLB season. Barring the possibility of another team being named the Montreal Expos in the future, All- Star Baseball 2005 was the last game in the All Star Baseball game series with that team. Players can play an exhibition game against the computer, or a 162 game season, choosing their favorite team. A player can also create its own players, and give them as much playing talent as the user might desire. There are five levels of play: rookie, veteran, all-star, legend and hall-of-famer. The rookie level is recommended for beginners: when using the rookie level, hitting the ball becomes automatically easier (with a mechanism that the game calls \\"timing\\"), In addition, players can choose whether the fielding during a game will be done entirely by the player, by the computer, or as a combination, both by the player and the computer. The latter is called the \\"assist\\" fielding mode. There are other modes of play. These are called the \\"Bonus play modes\\". The bonus play modes consist of a pick-up baseball bame, a Baseball Weekly trivia game, a trivia game, batting practice, and a home run contest. The pick-up game in particular features four different fields where the player can stage games, these being a schoolyard, a sandlot, a city park and a corn field. Major League Players \\"show up\\" for the pick-up games, but the player himself or herself has no control of who will show up, the computer makes that decision. Typically, 16 contemporary players and two retired players (ex. Ty Cobb and Satchel Paige) show up for games. The player chooses the field and the amount of innings that the pick-up games will be held for. The trivia game actually offers an image of a board game, perhaps making All Star Baseball 2005 the only video game not related to a board game that features a board game mode. In the trivia game, two players play against each other. The computer picks up cards from a \\"stack of cards\\" placed on the board, in a somewhat similar way to the cards and the board used in Monopoly. Players must then correctly answer the question behind each card. If the player is wrong, that represents one out. If the player is right, he or she gets a \\"hit\\", and the computer determines whether the hit was a single, double, triple or home run. Every time a player gets a \\"hit\\" by answering a question correctly, the computer places a chess figure on board, and the figure moves to the corresponding base, depending on what the computer determines. Before this game, players also choose what level of competition they want, and how many \\"innings\\" is the trivia game going to be played for. Barry Bonds does not appear in All Star Baseball 2005, because he is not a member of the Professional Baseball Players Association. Instead of him, the San Francisco Giants have a make believe player named \\"Wes Mailman\\". \\"Mailman\\" actually announces himself on one of the billboards at the Philadelphia Phillies home games. The game does feature play by play commentary by Arizona Diamondbacks television broadcaster Thom Brennaman and former major league player Steve Lyons, who sometimes offers long answers to Brennaman's questions during games. Reception The Xbox version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PS2 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The museum is situated in close proximity to the Perdana Lake Gardens and it provides an overview of Malaysian history and culture. Its facade comprises elements of traditional Malay and modern features. It was opened on 31 August 1963, and it serves as a repository of Malaysia's rich cultural and historical heritage. The National Museum is a three-storey structure long and wide, which is high at the central point. The museum houses four main galleries allotted to ethnology and natural history. The displays range from free-standing tableaux showing cultural events like weddings, festivals and costumes; to traditional weapons, musical instruments, arts and crafts, ceramics, and flora and fauna.  History  The old Selangor Museum The National Museum was established on the site of the former Selangor Museum. It was built by the British and Selangor governments in 1898 following the formation of the Federated Malay States in 1896. On 10 March 1945, during the end of World War II, the right wing of the museum was bombed and destroyed by the US B-29 bombers, from the Allied Forces. The museum's collection was then moved to the Perak Museum in Taiping. After World War II, the left wing of Selangor Museum was still in use as a historical site. On the brink of the independence of the Federation of Malaya, Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman conceived the idea to build a museum to house national historical and cultural treasures as well as specimens of flora and fauna. The old museum structure was completely demolished to make way for a new museum. Construction began in 1959 and was complete in 1963. The National Museum was officially opened on 31 August 1963 by Tuanku Syed Putra Ibni al-Marhum Syed Hassan Jamalullal, the 3rd Yang di- Pertuan Agong. On 4 April 1996 the building was gazetted under the Antiquities Act 169/1976 as an ancient monument and historical site.  Architecture  Avalokitesvara found at Bidor, 8th-9th century CE View into the main hall The museum's design by architect Ho Kok Hoe was inspired by the architecture of the Malay royal palaces and vernacular Malay architecture. The design incorporated the need for exhibition and activity spaces. The large mosaic murals spanning the entrance depict the history and culture of the country. The floor of the central section of the main building is decorated with special tiles which were gifts from the government of Pakistan. In addition, UNESCO facilitated consultancies by museum experts from other museums around the world. Displays and exhibits in the museum focus on local history, culture and traditions, arts and crafts, economic activities, local flora and fauna, weapons and currency. The museum houses various galleries, each with its own theme. The ground floor showcases the geographic and natural history of the Malay peninsula starting with the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms to Muslim sultanate of Malacca. The ancient Malay Hindu‚ÄìBuddhist states of Gangga Negara, Srivijaya and Majapahit are referenced. Among the collections are the stone makara statue, the bronze Avalokiteshvara of Bidor, the model of Bujang Valley temple in Kedah, and also displaying region's ancient legacy such as Javan Borobudur and Majapahit vessel. The exhibit continues to the later Muslim Sultanate of Malacca and the various states of Malaysia. The display demonstrate the importance of Malaccan sultanate for Malaysian national identity. The second floor is dedicated to the colonial history leading all the way to Independence. There are copies of the royal headgear of Malay rulers. = Central Hall = Adorning the floor of the Central Hall are blue geometric-design mosaic tiles from Pakistan, with intricate carved panels on the ceiling of the hall. The Central Hall houses temporary exhibitions. Thematic and special exhibitions are held at this hall at intervals to promote an awareness of the country's diverse culture and heritage. Foreign exhibitions are held occasionally. Some of the exhibitions that were held in this hall at some point of time included 'The Islamic Civilization', 'Our King', 'The World of Flowers', 'Durian King of Fruits', 'Masks from Sarawak', 'World Currency', 'Islamic Frontiers of China', 'American Frontiers', and 'Religious Architecture from the Netherlands'. The museum places strong emphasis on the Malay World, and a considerable section is devoted to the founding of the United Malay National Organisation, one of the parties of the National Front (Barisan Nasional). Few if at all were any mentions made of the involvement of the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress, which three parties worked together to achieve Independence of Malaya on 31 August 1957.  Grounds  Traditional carts Other galleries include the National Sports Gallery and the Natural History Gallery. In the vicinity of the museum building, there are a number of outdoor displays of transportation in Malaysia, past and present. An interesting exhibit is the Melaka Bullock Cart which closely resembles the early American horse-drawn wagon. Of unparalleled interest are the Steam Locomotive made by Kitson & Co, England, which was put into service in 1921 until it ceased operation in 1969. It covered 1.5 million rail miles; a Tin Dredge which resembles a floating factory, on a natural or artificial lake. Also on display are motorised vehicles, including antiqued civic vehicles and private vehicles, including an early 1.3 litre Proton Saga, the first national car launched on July 9th 1985. National Museum also holds regular thematic exhibitions featuring specific aspects of life and world culture. = Istana Satu = Istana Satu Another attraction of the museum is an original-size old Terengganu timber palace known as Istana Satu. It was erected by Sultan Zainal Abidin III, Sultan of Terengganu in 1884 in the compound of Kota Istana Maziah, Kuala Terengganu. This building is of Terengganu Malay traditional architecture, in the form called \\"Rumah Tiang Dua Belas\\". The wood used is cengal. Istana Satu was erected in the National Museum compound in April 1974. Rich Malay craftsmanship is evident throughout the palace, from the intricate wood carvings that adorn doors and windows. The restored palace is a charming wooden house designed for the tropics. Standing on stilts that allow air to circulate freely under the building, the palace's steep thatch roof contributes further to keeping the interior of the house nice and cool. Standing majestically next to the Istana Satu are two keliriengs or burial poles. A kelirieng is made of a huge hardwood tree trunk, carved from the top to bottom. Niched up to its sides is a space for the bodies of slaves and followers and hollowed at the top to place the jar containing the chief's bones. = The Orang Asli Crafts Museum = Visitors who want to learn about the original inhabitants of Malaysia should visit the Orang Asli Craft Museum. The museum showcases the arts and handicrafts of the Orang Asli people, the aboriginal communities who dwell mostly in rural areas across the Malaysian Peninsula. The museum explains how there are 18 different tribes of Orang Asli divided into 3 main groups, the Negrito, the Senai and the Proto Malay. The Orang Asli are famed for their handicrafts, particularly the wood carving skills by the Mah Meri and Jah Hut tribes who like to carve masks and figures and these are highly valued by collectors.

Kasim  Museum Volunteer Malaysia (MVM)  In 2007 cultural and history enthusiasts residing in the greater Kuala Lumpur area formed, with the support of the Department of National Museums, a group of volunteer museum tour guides to accommodate the growing number of international tourists to the museum. At any time, somewhere between 20 and 100 volunteers of many nationalities provide tours in English, Korean, Japanese, and French. A related group was established for Malaysian visitors, operating primarily on weekends. Apart from tour-guide activities, MVM is active in promoting Malaysian cultural and historical heritage in schools and organising tours for members to places around Kuala Lumpur and Malaysia, such as a visit to Kuala Kangsar and Georgetown, Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary,Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary (Temerloh) , Tourism Pahang.Kuala Gandah Elephant Sanctuary, Endemic Guides. Royal Selangor in Setapak and celebrating the Hari Moyang in the Hma' Meri Orang Asli village in Pulau Carey. The group also organised talks and classes for the members and the public to safe-guard as well as introducing the rich cultural and historical heritage of the country. In 2009, MVM organised the \\"Jom Main\\" Exhibition with the collaboration of National Museum, which revisits traditional games that children in Malaysia used to play. Public transportation Muzium Negara is situated just behind, and lends its name to, the underground Muzium Negara MRT station. The station is connected to KL Sentral, located across Jalan Damansara, via a long underground walkway.

He was the younger brother of the artist Paul Nash. Early life Over The Top (1918; Art. IWM ART 2243) Nash was born in London, the younger son of lawyer William Harry Nash who served as recorder of Abingdon and Caroline Maude Jackson. His mother came from a family with a naval tradition; she was mentally unstable and died in a mental asylum in 1910. In 1901 the family moved to Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. Nash was educated at Langley Place in Slough and afterwards at Wellington College, Berkshire. He particularly enjoyed botany, but was unsure which career path to take. At first he worked as a newspaper reporter for the Middlesex and Berkshire Gazette, in 1910. His brother became a student at the Slade School of Art the same year, and through his brother Paul, met Claughton Pellew and Dora Carrington. John Nash had no formal art training, but was encouraged by his brother to develop his abilities as a draughtsman. His early work was in watercolour and included Biblical scenes, comic drawings and landscapes. A joint exhibition with Paul at the Dorien Leigh Gallery, London, in 1913 was successful, and John was invited to become a founder-member of the London Group in 1914. He was an important influence on the work of the artist Dora Carrington (with whom he was in love), and some of her works have been mistaken for his in the past. First World War Oppy Wood, 1917, Evening. (Art. IWM ART 2243) In 1915 Nash joined Harold Gilman in Robert Bevan's Cumberland Market Group and in May that year exhibited with Gilman, Charles Ginner and Robert Bevan at the Goupil Gallery. Nash's health initially prevented him enlisting at the outbreak of the First World War but from November 1916 to January 1918 he served in the Artists Rifles, the unit that his brother had joined in 1914 before taking a commission in the Hampshire Regiment. He served as a sergeant at the Battle of Passchendaele and at the battle of Cambrai. On the recommendation of his brother, Paul worked as an official war artist from 1918. In 1914 Nash began painting in oils with the encouragement of Harold Gilman, whose meticulous craftsmanship influenced his finest landscapes. Nash's most famous painting is Over the Top (oil on canvas, 79.4 x 107.3 cm), now hanging in the Imperial War Museum. It is an image of the counter-attack at Welsh Ridge on 30 December 1917, during which the 1st Battalion Artists' Rifles left their trenches and pushed towards Marcoing near Cambrai. Of the eighty men, sixty-eight were killed or wounded during the first few minutes. Nash was one of the twelve spared by the shell-fire, and painted this picture three months later.Barry Gregory. A History of The Artists Rifles. Pen & Sword. 2006. p.176. The Cornfield, held by the Tate Gallery, was the first painting Nash completed that did not depict the theme of war. The picture with its ordered view of the landscape and geometric treatment of the corn stooks prefigures his brother Paul's Equivalents for the Megaliths. Nash said that he and Paul used to paint for their own pleasure only after six o'clock, when their work as war artists was over for the day. Hence the long shadows cast by the evening sun across the middle of the painting. Post-war career The Cornfield, 1918, oil on canvas, 68.6 x 76.2 cm, Tate Gallery Nash married Carrington's friend Dorothy Christine K√ºhlenthal in May 1918. She was the daughter of a German chemist who had settled in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, and had studied at the Slade. Their only child, William, was born in 1930; he died when he fell out of the back of a moving car in 1935, aged 4. From 1918 to 1921, Nash lived at Gerrard's Cross, with summer expeditions to the Chiltern Hills and Gloucestershire. In 1919 he became a member of the New English Art Club, and in 1921 he became the first art critic for The London Mercury. He moved to Meadle, near Princes Risborough, also in Buckinghamshire, in 1921, which remained his permanent home until 1944. He frequently visited the valley of the River Stour in Essex and Suffolk, where he bought a summer cottage. After the First World War, Nash's efforts went mainly into painting landscapes. Eric Newton, the art historian said of him 'If I wanted a foreigner to understand the mood of a typical English landscape, I would show him Nash's best watercolours.\\"Newton, Eric ' In my view' April 1939 Emotions, however, concerning the war continued to linger for many years; and this was depicted in his landscape painting. This is particularly evident in The Moat, Grange Farm, Kimble, oil on canvas, exhibited in 1922. In this brooding landscape the trees and their tendril-like branches envelope the entire picture plane.The dark subtle colours and evening light give the painting a claustrophobic atmosphere. This painting, completed a few years after the war, is characterised by a sense of bleak desolation that suggests the profound introspection that for many followed the devastation of the war. Although he had a great love of nature Nash often used natural subjects to convey powerful and sensitive thoughts concerning the human condition.John Nash 1893‚Äì1977 Published in The Modern British Paintings, Drawings and Sculpture, London, 1964,11 by Mary Chamot, Dennis Farr and Martin Butlin. He was close friends with the writer Ronald Blythe, who dedicated his best-selling book Akenfield to the artist, and who shared his love of the unmanaged forest where fallen trees were left to create their own chaos.Roger Deakin, Notes from Walnut Tree Farm (2006) p. 3 In 1923 Nash became a member of the Modern English Water-colour Society. In 1923 he worked in Dorset and in 1924 in Bath and Bristol. From 1924 to 1929 he taught at The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art (Oxford). In 1927, he wrote and illustrated a book on Poisonous Plants. From 1934 to 1940 he taught at the Royal College of Art in London, working on wood engravings and lithographs. In 1939 he visited the Gower Peninsula, near Swansea ‚Äì the first of many visits to Gower and other parts of Wales. Nash was also an accomplished printmaker. He was a founder member of the Society of Wood Engravers in 1920. He produced woodcuts and wood engravings first as illustrations to literary periodicals, and then increasingly as illustrations for books produced by the private presses; these include Jonathan Swift's Directions to Servants (Golden Cockerel Press, 1925) and Edmund Spenser's The Shepheard's Calendar (Cresset Press, 1930). His interest in botanical subjects is shown by his illustrations to Bob Gathorne- Hardy's Wild Flowers in Britain (Batsford 1938).Sir John Rothenstein, John Nash, London:MacDonald, 1983 Later life At the beginning of the Second World War Nash served in the Observer Corps, moving to the Admiralty in 1940 as an official war artist with the rank of Captain in the Royal Marines. He was promoted acting major in 1943, and relinquished his commission in November 1944. After the war, Nash lived at Wormingford in Essex. He joined the staff of the Royal College of Art in 1945 and continued to teach there and later at the Flatford Mill field studies centre. When in Essex, Nash taught at Colchester Art School and in 1946, along with Henry Collins, Cedric Morris, Lett Haines and Roderic Barrett, became one of the founders of Colchester Art Society and later the Society's president. Nash bequeathed his personal library and several of his paintings and engravings to The Minories, Colchester, who later sold most of the material to the Tate. Nash became an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1940 and a full member in 1951. He became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1964. His retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1967 was the first for a living painter. Nash suffered from severe arthritis in later years. His wife died in 1976; they had been married for over 58 years. Nash died on 23 September 1977, in Colchester. They are both buried at St Andrew's, Wormingford, Essex.

It has a capacity for 15,000 people and is situated among of gardens. Its key features are a minaret and a 16-pointed star concrete main roof. The umbrella, synonymous with the tropics, is featured conspicuously ‚Äì the main roof is reminiscent of an open umbrella, the minaret's cap a folded one. The folded plates of the concrete main roof are a creative solution to achieving the larger spans required in the main gathering hall. Reflecting pools and fountains spread throughout the compound. Completed in 1965, the mosque is a bold and modern approach in reinforced concrete, symbolic of the aspirations of a then newly independent nation.  History  Malaya gained its independence from the British government on 31 August 1957. Major development programs in areas of the economy, social, and architecture were actively implemented in line with the new government. The programs were also to portray new progressive culture and achieved democracy. Therefore, on 30 July 1957, in the meeting of the Federal Executive Council, an idea to build a national mosque as a symbol of the country's independence was mooted. In another meeting on 5 March 1958, Chief Ministers of the eleven states in the Federation of Malaya, a proposal was made to name the mosque Masjid Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, in recognition of Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman's efforts in guiding the country to gaining independence. However, Tunku refused this honour; on the contrary, he named it Masjid Negara in thanksgiving for the country's peaceful independence without bloodshed. The mosque was built on the former site of a church, the Venning Road Brethren Gospel Hall, which was acquired by the government in 1961. The church was offered land on Jalan Imbi as a replacement and is now known as Jalan Imbi Chapel. The original structure of the mosque was designed by a three-person team from the Public Works Department: UK architect Howard Ashley, and Malaysians Hisham Albakri and Baharuddin Kassim. The engineer in charge of the construction of the mosque, which commenced in 1963 was Antony Morris. On Friday, 27 August 1965, the mosque was declared open by the third Yang di- Pertuan Agong, the late Tuanku Syed Putra of Perlis. The mosque underwent major renovations in 1987, and the once-pink concrete roof is now clad in green and blue tiles. Today, Masjid Negara continues to stand sleek and stylish against the Kuala Lumpur skyline. An underground passage leads to the National Mosque located near the railway station, along Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin. Its unique modern design embodies a contemporary expression of traditional Islamic art calligraphy and ornamentation. Near the mosque is the Makam Pahlawan (Heroes' Mausoleum), a burial ground of several Malaysian Muslim leaders. Makam Pahlawan is a 7-pointed star concrete roofed structure. On 27 August 2015, Masjid Negara celebrated its Golden Jubilee (50th anniversary).

The album followed Hipodil's debut effort from 1993 Alkoholen delirium (Alcoholic Delirium).  History  After the massive success of Hipodil's previous album, the band had to use the momentum and offer a consistent second product. Though this time recording and production work were better, Hipodil cleverly chose to copy the winning formula of their debut instead of searching for a new direction. Yet, Hipodil vocalist and frontman Svetoslav Vitkov put a lot of references to his favourite heavy metal influences and especially Slayer in the record. The others in the band however did not like his ideas about the projected style of the album and this ignited a quarrel, which almost led to Vitkov's departure from Hipodil. As the band had not enough time to work on their far less-than-perfect music skills after the extensive national tour in support of Alkoholen delirium, they put their money on more explicit lyrics, based on a broader range of topics which Bulgarian society at the time offered in abundance. They also changed their label and moved to Riva Sound. In early 1995, Hipodil launched a long national tour to support the album which took them to some 20 cities across Bulgaria. During most of the tour, vocalist Svetoslav Vitkov suffered from sore throat and, reportedly, on many dates guest keyboard player Ventsislav Mitzov backed him heavily with the vocal parts. Commercially, the album was very successful, though it did not produce any radio hits and no videos, chiefly due to the obscene lyrics. No official sales figures were ever released, a usual practice in Bulgarian music industry. Nek'uf ujas, nek'uf at was released on audio cassettes only and was never re-released on a CD though some tracks were included in the band's greatest hits compilation Tu'pest in 1999 and its sequel Tu'pest 2 in 2009. Presently, the album is out of print and new copies cannot be purchased anywhere, however it is available for streaming and digital download on various sites. Amazon also offers print-on-demand CDs of the album.  The Music  Despite some darker tunes and more depressive lyrics, the band stayed true to their mix of puns, mockery and parodies. Of course, the album has enough songs of Hipodil's trademark party-oriented, sex & alcohol-based lyrics and a lot of mockeries, especially with the gay society in \\"Jenite sa za pederasi\\" (Women Are for Gays) and with the then-popular Bulgarian pop duet Doni & Momchil in \\"Moni i Domchil\\" (the song begins with a Slayer riff after the intro part, which is a parody of the Doni & Momchil song \\"Umoreni krila\\"). In \\"Jenite sa za pederasti\\", there is a motif from the Judas Priest's anthem \\"Breaking the Law\\", expressively added in honour of the British band's frontman Rob Halford. \\"Hipodili\\" (Hipodils) was inspired by the mass disorder at a Hipodil's concert in Varna in 1993, during the Alkoholen delirium tour, when all band members along with some people from the audience were arrested. (The reasons for the rout were not clear but the band has repeatedly stated that alcohol was in the base of the problem.) The song became some kind of an anthem and emblem of the band and a gig favourite.

It is promoted as a rear engined lightweight coach chassis. It is primarily intended for tourist and long-distance duties. B7R is also manufactured in China, Brazil, Hungary, India and Iran for use in regional transport services. B7R is powered by Volvo D7E (previously D7A, D7B and D7C) six-cylinder diesel engine with turbocharger and intercooler. The D7E engine produces 290 hp with 1200 Nm of torque between 1050 and 1650 r/min. It comes with a retarder incorporated into the gearbox. The retarder slows down the engine when brakes are applied. Once the engine slows down, disk brakes take over and bring the vehicle to complete stop, almost in an instant. Its frame is a robust steel construction with a flat upper face. A flat upper face simplifies building bus body. It could be built with a maximum length of about 12.5 metres. The B7R is also available as complete buses - the Volvo 7350 (for Mexico), Volvo 9400 (for India) and Volvo 8700. The B7R is the most widely used deluxe long distance bus in India and is employed by not only the state-owned transport corporations of the state of Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh but also by private operators. Volvo also developed a low-floor variant of B7R, known as the Volvo B7RLE, for intercity and city operations. Volvo B7R in Curitiba In Brazil, B7R is produced in Curitiba since 1998. The first B7R in the country was imported from Sweden and operated in Curitiba's public transportation as a Direct Line Bus. In 2012, B7R was renamed to B290R (B7RLE was renamed to B290RLE), and is often used in BRS and BRT applications. In the Philippines, B7R is also the basis for the GDW6127HKC and DMMW DM16 (included a Volvo 9800-styled front fascia) manufactured by Autodelta Coach Builders Inc and Del Monte Motor Works. It is similar to the low-end version, also the B7RLE. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, the Volvo B7R only presented from 2003 to 2004. But there are many bus companies that use the Volvo B7R, such as PO. Harapan Jaya, PO. Nusantara, etc. In the operation, this bus was sometimes used as the regular route and sometimes used as a tourist bus. Using the Volvo D7E, this bus has large horsepower, compared with standard Indonesian busses in the rear-engined busses, such as Hino RK8JSKA, Hino RG1JS/JN, Mercedes Benz OH 1521, and Mercedes Benz OH 1525. But due to its large power and high maintenance, many companies that were using the B7R sold the bus or changed the D7E engine into a Mitsubishi Fuso 6D16 engine or Nissan Diesel FE6B or Hino J08E to reducing operational and maintenance cost.

Accordingly, it can be seen as a rhetorical relative of irony. The device is also called paralipsis (œÄŒ±œÅŒ¨ŒªŒµŒπœàŒπœÇ) ‚Äì also spelled paraleipsis or paralepsis ‚Äì or occupatio, and known also as praeteritio, preterition, or parasiopesis (œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÉŒπœéœÄŒ∑œÉŒπœÇ). Usage As a rhetorical device, apophasis can serve a number of purposes. It can be employed to raise an ad hominem or otherwise controversial attack while disclaiming responsibility for it, as in, \\"I refuse to discuss the rumor that my opponent is a drunk.\\" This can make it a favored tactic in politics. Apophasis can be used passive-aggressively, as in, \\"I forgive you for your jealousy, so I won't even mention what a betrayal it was.\\" In Cicero's \\"Pro Caelio\\" speech, he says to a prosecutor, \\"\\" (\\"I now forget your wrongs, Clodia, I set aside the memory of my pain [that you caused].\\")Cicero, \\"Pro Caelio\\", Chapter 50 Apophasis can be used to discuss a taboo subject, as in, \\"We are all fully loyal to the emperor, so we wouldn't dare to claim that his new clothes are a transparent hoax.\\" As a rhetorical device, it can serve various purposes, often dependent on the relationship of the speaker to the addressee and the extent of their shared knowledge. Apophasis is rarely literal; instead, it conveys meaning through implications that may depend on this context. As an example of how meaning shifts, the English phrase \\"needless to say\\" invokes shared understanding, but its actual meaning depends on whether that understanding was really shared. The speaker is alleging that it is not necessary to say something because the addressee already knows it, but is it so? If it is, it may merely emphasize a pertinent fact. If the knowledge is weighted with history, it may be an indirect way of levying an accusation (\\"needless to say, because you are responsible\\"). If the addressee does not actually already possess the knowledge, it may be a way to condescend: the speaker suspected as much but wanted to call attention to the addressee's ignorance. Conversely, it could be a sincere and polite way to share necessary information that the addressee may or may not know without implying that the addressee is ignorant. Apophasis can serve to politely avoid suggestion of ignorance on the part of an audience, as found in the narrative style of Adso of Melk in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, where the character fills in details of early fourteenth-century history for the reader by stating it is unnecessary to speak of them. Eco and Weaver use the spelling paralepsis or \\"passing over\\" for the phenomenon. Conversely, the same introduction can be made sarcastically to condescend to an audience and imply their ignorance. Another diplomatic use would be to raise a criticism indirectly, as in, \\"It would be out of line for me to say that this action would be unwise and unaffordable, sir, as I only care about your best interests.\\" Examples When apophasis is taken to its extreme, the speaker provides full details, stating or drawing attention to something in the very act of pretending to pass it over: \\"I will not stoop to mentioning the occasion last winter when our esteemed opponent was found asleep in an alleyway with an empty bottle of vodka still pressed to his lips.\\" In the 1984 U.S. presidential campaign debates, Ronald Reagan used a humorous apophasis to deflect scrutiny of his own fitness at age 73 by replying, \\"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\\" In 1988, he applied a harsher apophasis toward George H.W. Bush's opponent Michael Dukakis, who was rumored to have received psychological treatment, \\"Look, I'm not going to pick on an invalid.\\" United States President Donald Trump frequently employs apophasis. In 2015, Trump said of fellow Republican presidential candidate and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, \\"I promised I would not say that she ran Hewlett-Packard into the ground, that she laid off tens of thousands of people and she got viciously fired. I said I will not say it, so I will not say it.\\" In 2016, he tweeted of journalist Megyn Kelly, ‚ÄúI refuse to call [her] a bimbo, because that would not be politically correct.\\" In 2017, as president, he tweeted of the leader of North Korea, \\"Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me 'old,' when I would NEVER call him 'short and fat?'\\" See also Notes References * External links *Figures of rhetoric: Apophasis *A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices: Apophasis *Wordsmith: Paralipsis Rhetorical techniques Figures of speech Logic ","title":"Apophasis"},{"id":"1784455","text":"The National Monument is a sculpture that commemorates those who died in Malaysia's struggle for freedom, principally against the Japanese occupation during World War II and the Malayan Emergency, which lasted from 1948 until 1960. It is located in the Federal capital, Kuala Lumpur. The Malaysian Houses of Parliament is situated near the monument. It is the world's tallest bronze freestanding sculpture grouping. Every year on 31 July on Warriors' Day, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Prime Minister, and the heads of the Malaysian Armed Forces and the Royal Malaysia Police pay their respects to the fallen heroes by laying garlands at the monument. History =Kuala Lumpur Cenotaph= The Cenotaph near the National Monument. The predecessor of the National Monument is an interwar-era cenotaph originally erected by the colonial British administration on a 10m flat grass-covered ground on a roundabout adjoining Victory Avenue (now part of Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin) and Raja Road, close to the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station and Railway Administration Building. Originally intended to commemorate the Great War (1914‚Äì1918) and honour those from the British Malayan colonies who were killed in the war, the cenotaph's inscription would later include fallen British Malayan soldiers of World War II (1939‚Äì1945) after the conclusion of World War II and resumption of British rule. Names of the fallen are engraved on the plaques of the cenotaph as a token of tribute to their sacrifices. In 1964, the cenotaph was moved from its original location to the site of the National Monument in Lake Gardens before a planned flyover connecting Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin and the Parliament roundabout was constructed over the original site. Transfer of the cenotaph was made possible by dismantling the structure into catalogued parts, allowing the structure to be transported in pieces and reassembled in its original form at the National Monument. Following its move, inscriptions were added to include fallen soldiers from the Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960) and an archaic Malay translation of \\"To Our Glorious Dead\\", \\"Untok Mengingati Jasa Pahlawan-pahlawan Yang Gugor\\" (\\"To Remember the Service of Warriors Who Have Fallen\\"). The monument is depicted on several Malaysian 1 Ringgit banknotes issued between 1982 and 1989.http://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/ASI/MLY/MLY0019.htmhttp://www.banknote.ws/COLLECTION/countries/ASI/MLY/MLY0027.htm =National Monument= The concept of a national monument was mooted by Malaysia's first Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman, who was inspired by the Marine Corps War Memorial during his visit to the United States in October 1960, before personally meeting Felix de Weldon for a favour to design the monument. Felix de Weldon contributed in creating Malaysia‚Äôs Tugu Negara (National Monument). He also designed the Iwo Jima Memorial located at Arlington, Washington DC. The National Monument was completed and officially opened on 8 February 1966, by Ismail Nasiruddin of Terengganu, then Yang di- Pertuan Agong. It was proclaimed a memorial park dedicated to the 11,000 people who died during the 12-year Malayan Emergency (1948‚Äì1960). Thereafter, a wreath-laying ceremony takes place at the monument every 31 July on Warriors Day. De Weldon was later conferred with the title Tan Sri, the Malaysian equivalent of a high-ranking knighthood. On 27 August 1975, the monument suffered extensive damage due to an explosion set off by a communist terrorist. It has since been restored to its original state with the renovated statues unveiled on 11 May 1977. A fence was then erected and the complex was declared a protected area between sunset and dawn. Every day at dawn, a soldier raises the national flag and lowers it at dusk. Although Warriors' Day commemoration services are no longer officially held at the National Monument, Remembrance Day ceremonies continue to take place there. Pictured is Remembrance Sunday at the National Monument's cenotaph on 13 November 2011. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Jamil Khir Baharom has stated that from 2010, the Warriors' Day commemoration service would be held elsewhere after Malaysia's National Fatwa Council guidelines declared the statues \\"un- Islamic\\" and potentially idolatrous. Defence Minister Zahid Hamidi added that a new \\"Warrior's Square\\" would be built in the country's administrative capital Putrajaya. When asked why the decision was made only after almost four decades of celebrating Warriors' Day at the present site, Jamil evaded comment, saying \\"Alhamdulillah, we are serious in solving this issue\\". A similar sentiment would later be echoed in September 2016 by Harussani Zakaria, a Perak-based mufti, who declared that the construction of the monument had been a \\"big sin\\" and \\"idolatrous\\", because building monuments in the shape of humans was haram in Islam. Design Commissioned in 1963 and constructed in 1966, the sculpture that stands as a centrepiece of the monument is 15 meters (49.21 feet) tall, made of bronze and was designed by Austrian sculptor Felix de Weldon, who was also responsible for the Marine Corps War Memorial in Virginia, United States. The sculpture depicts 7 figures, 5 of the figures [1. holding the Malaysian flag, 2. armed with a rifle and bayonet (left), 3. armed with a machine gun (right), 4. soldiers tending to fifth wounded compatriot] represents the victorious allied forces while the other 2 figures that lie on the ground represents that of the defeated communist forces. Overall the monument depicts the victory of the forces of democracy, peace and freedom over that of communism. The sculpture was then cast at a foundry in Rome at a cost of RM600,000. Each of the bronze figures symbolises leadership, suffering, unity, vigilance, strength, courage and sacrifice. The stones that the soldiers are standing on were imported from the small coastal city of Karlshamn in South Eastern Sweden. The granite base of the sculpture bears the Malayan Coat of Arms, flanked on either side by inscriptions in English, Latin script, and also in Malay in Jawi script: Jalan Tugu Jalan Tugu, originally known as Cenotaph Road, refers to a road which was laid out following the completion of the cenotaph and adjoins the original cenotaph roundabout. The road was renamed to a direct Malay translation of the English name following a street renaming campaign during the 1960s, and continues to carry this name, as of 2013. The road runs parallel to the Kuala Lumpur Railway Station, and is located opposite the Railway Administration Building and National Mosque.

Star Judd, Henry Stanley Plummer, Melvin Millet, and Donald Balfour. Career Charles graduated from the medical school of Northwestern University in 1888 and joined his father, William Worrall Mayo, and older brother, William James Mayo, in their private medical practice in Rochester, Minnesota. Last office of Charles Mayo as it was during his lifetime The Mayos' first partner was Augustus Stinchfield, who was hired by William Worrall Mayo. Once in place as a partner in the private practice, W. W. Mayo retired at age 73. The private practice became the not-for-profit Mayo Clinic in 1919. At that point, the remaining partners went on salary, and the Mayo Properties Association was established. The world's first \\"integrated group practice\\" was established by the seven partners and staff. The Mayo Clinic came to be regarded as one of the foremost medical treatment and research institutions in the world. Within Mayo's lifetime, it registered one million patients. Doctors Mayo stamp The idea of medical specialization was developed by this group of medical pioneers. A close and enduring relationship between the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota Medical School developed. C. H. Mayo specialized in surgery of the thyroid and nervous system. He was also responsible for the clinic's ophthalmic patients until 1908. He and early partners insisted on sterile conditions in the operating room, and that was one of many factors that contributed to the medical practice's early surgical successes. Personal Life Charles Mayo's wife was Edith Graham, of Rochester, MN, whom he married in 1893. He earned a Distinguished Service Medal for his service in WWI and afterwards in the U.S. Army's Officers' Medical Reserve Corps, eventually rising to the rank of Brigadier General. He belonged to the Episcopal church. Charles H. Mayo was engaged in numerous civic organizations. He was a regent and later, president of the American College of Surgeons. He was a professor of surgery at the University of Minnesota, active there and nationally in both Alpha Kappa Kappa and Sigma Xi fraternities. He was a Freemason, and member of Rochester Lodge #21 of the Grand Lodge of Minnesota, AF&AM;, a Knight Templar, Scottish Rite Mason and Shriner, a Kiwanis, and was active in numerous other professional, civic and social clubs.Minnesota and its People, vol.III, p.143, accessed 16 May 2020. Legacy Mayo retired in 1930 and died of pneumonia in 1939 in Chicago, Illinois. His two sons Charles William Mayo and Joseph Graham Mayo both worked at the clinic. Joseph Graham Mayo was killed in November 1936 in an accident when a train hit his car killing him and his hunting dog, Floosie. Mayo and his dog were buried in the same casket. A grandson, Charles Horace Mayo II, served a residency at the clinic. The United States Postal Service released a stamp on September 11, 1964, depicting Charles Horace Mayo and his brother.

Her first album, La Llorona, went platinum in Canada and brought Lhasa a F√©lix Award and a Juno Award. Following this success, Lhasa toured with Lilith Fair, then joined her sisters in a French circus troupe, contributing her husky voice to the musical backdrop. She lived in Marseille and began to write more songs, then moved back to Montreal and produced a second album, The Living Road. Once again, she toured in support of her album, and she collaborated with other musicians on their projects. During this time, BBC Radio 3 honored her as the best world music artist of the Americas in 2005. She published a book about her impressions of life on the road. Lhasa recorded a third album, titled Lhasa, but she was diagnosed with cancer in 2009 around the time it was released. She endured severe treatments but these did not halt the illness. She died on New Year's Day 2010. A memorial program of her music was put together in January 2012, performed in Montreal by artists who had worked with her. Biography Lhasa was born in Big Indian, New York, of a Mexican father, language instructor Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Sela, and an American mother, photographer and actress Alexandra Karam. According to Lhasa, her hippie parents did not give her a name until the age of five months; her mother was reading a book about Tibet and the word Lhasa \\"just grabbed her\\" as the right name for the baby girl. Lhasa's maternal grandmother was Elena Karam (1909‚Äì2001), an actress best known for her leading role in Elia Kazan's film America America. Her paternal grandmother was Carmen de Obarrio (1906‚Äì1982), a Panamanian pianist who studied in Los Angeles with Egon Petri, and with Edgar Var√®se in San Francisco. Lhasa had a Lebanese great-grandfather named Basel who sang in six languages. Her mother played harp and her father played flute. Her first decade was spent criss-crossing the United States and Mexico, living and traveling in a converted school bus with her parents and siblings, home- schooled by her mother. Both her parents spoke fluent Spanish, but she was raised speaking primarily English, with Spanish added during a total of eight years' residence in Mexico. Along with her family she listened to a wide variety of recordings including songs by Chilean musician Victor Jara; as a young child she dreamed of marrying him some day, not knowing he had been killed. At age 13 when her parents separated, Lhasa, her mother and her sisters settled in San Francisco where Lhasa started singing in a Greek cafe. She included Spanish language lessons in her high school studies. After viewing a documentary about Billie Holiday, Lhasa determined that she, too, would make a career in singing. In 1991, she traveled to Montreal, Quebec, Canada to visit her sisters who were students at l'√âcole nationale de cirque, the National Circus School of Canada, and she decided to make Montreal her home. Steeped in a Francophone culture for the first time, she sang for five years in bars, collaborating with rock guitarist Yves Desrosiers. In 1992, Denis Wolff, general manager of the independent Canadian record company, Audiogram, saw Lhasa performing, her head shaved, in front of a tiny nightclub audience. He was struck with \\"her personality, her charisma and her voice\\" ‚Äì he soon signed her to the label. With Desrosiers she developed the material that eventually became her first album. Career Audiogram finished La Llorona in early 1997 with Desrosiers producing, arranging and accompanying. The Spanish-language album mixed 1930s and 1940s-era Latin American songs with original songs; it was strongly influenced by Mexican music but also by klezmer, torch songs, gypsy jazz and Middle Eastern music. Even though she did not consider herself fluent in Spanish, Lhasa said that she enjoyed singing in the language because it came from \\"a deeper place\\". Wolff said that he expected the album to be marketed to people other than Spanish speakers because it was so different from contemporary Hispanic music. La Llorona was released first in Quebec on February 4, 1997, then in the US two months later. A music video was shot for one song, \\"Desierto\\", released in May. The album brought Lhasa much success, including the Quebec F√©lix Award in Canada for \\"Artiste qu√©b√©cois ‚Äì musique du monde\\" (\\"Best world music artist from Quebec\\") in 1997 and a Canadian Juno Award for Best Global Artist in 1998. The album was certified platinum in Canada. By 2003, it had sold 120,000 units in Canada, 330,000 in France, and 30,000 in the U.S. Lhasa performing in Stuttgart in 2005 After touring in Europe and North America for several years with Lilith Fair, Lhasa moved to France in 1999 to join her sisters in Pocheros, a circus/theatre company. Lhasa sang in the troupe's show called \\"La Maison Autre\\" (\\"The Other House\\"). Living out of trailers with her sisters and traveling from place to place, Lhasa said it was \\"like when I was growing up.\\" She eventually reached Marseille, where she started writing songs again. After composing enough material, Lhasa returned to Montreal with her new songs to produce her second album, The Living Road, which was released in 2003. While La Llorona had been entirely in Spanish, The Living Road included songs in English, French and Spanish. A two-year tour followed the release of The Living Road, taking Lhasa and her group to 17 countries. Lhasa collaborated with a variety of other artists. She was a guest singer on the Tindersticks' track \\"Sometimes It Hurts\\" off their Waiting for the Moon album, and later joined Tindersticks' singer Stuart Staples for a duet on the track \\"That Leaving Feeling\\", found on his Leaving Songs album. She also appeared as a guest on the albums of French singers Arthur H and J√©r√¥me Mini√®re, and the French gypsy music group Bratsch. BBC Radio 3 named her the best world music artist of the Americas; one of the categories of the 2005 World Music Awards. The Living Road was nominated for best \\"Culture Crossing\\" album and \\"Album of the Year\\", but it did not win. Her song \\"Anywhere On This Road\\" was placed on the annual compilation CD of award winners; the BBC cited Ibrahim Maalouf's \\"alluring Arabic trumpet\\" on the song as \\"just one stunning moment\\" among many within Lhasa's album. Lhasa filmed a video for the song \\"Con toda palabra\\"; directed by Ralph Dfouni and Brigitte Henry, the video was nominated in 2006 for a Juno Award but did not win. At the 2007 ION International Film Festival, the video was named the \\"Music Video of the Year\\". Lhasa published a French- language book in 2008, titled La Route chante (The Road sings). The book offers snippets of experiences and impressions of Lhasa's life on the road with her sisters, of music, and of her childhood. Lhasa's third album Lhasa was released in April 2009 in Canada and Europe, with fewer musicians involved in the production. The next month in the U.S., she could also be heard on the title track of Patrick Watson's album Wooden Arms. After the Lhasa album was recorded but before it was released, Lhasa was diagnosed with breast cancer. The album's closing song, \\"Anyone and Everyone\\", was described as prophetic by Jan Fairley of The Guardian ‚Äì it was written from the viewpoint of one who knows death is near. Lhasa said that the song was about inner happiness and \\"feeling my feet in the earth, having a place in the world, of things taking care of themselves.\\" Because of her illness, Lhasa canceled a proposed world tour that would have begun in late 2009. She also set aside plans to make an album of songs written by Chileans Victor Jara and Violeta Parra. Death Following a 21-month-long battle with breast cancer, Lhasa died, age 37, on the evening of January 1, 2010, at her home in Montreal. She was survived by her partner Ryan Morey, by her parents, and by nine siblings. Lhasa was cremated, in accordance with her wishes. On January 9, a funeral ceremony was held for family and friends at the Ukrainian National Federation Hall in Montreal. A cemetery plot and stone for Lhasa are at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery, Montreal. Following her death, it snowed in Montreal for four days. Lhasa collaborator Patrick Watson said that some of her friends felt it was a last message from her, and with experimental group Esmerine he co-wrote a song dedicated to Lhasa: \\"Snow Day for Lhasa\\". A sold-out memorial concert called \\"La Route chante: A Community Show for Lhasa\\" was held on January 6, 2012, at the Rialto Theatre in Montreal, honoring the life of Lhasa. Musicians who collaborated with Lhasa performed, along with other artists such as Katie Moore, Thomas Hellman, and Plants and Animals. Lhasa's manager, David-√âtienne Savoie, and her collaborator Watson originated the concept of a memorial concert, and the musicians met in Watson's studio to rehearse. To open the concert, The Barr Brothers played together with Sarah Pag√©, Miles Perkin and Joe Grass, interpreting Lhasa's \\"Small Song\\". Other performers included Ariane Moffatt, Esmerine, Watson, Mario L√©gar√©, Arthur H, J√©r√¥me Mini√®re and Brazilian-born singer B√Øa. A second show was added the following night to accommodate demand for tickets. On January 16, Jim Corcoran devoted an episode of his CBC Radio One program √Ä Propos, a weekly show about Quebec music, to a Lhasa tribute show. On the summer solstice, June 21, 2010, another memorial ceremony took place in Bourgogne, France. Some of Lhasa's ashes were dispersed in a small river that flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Madonna Hamel's audio documentary She Moves Between Worlds: Remembering Lhasa de Sela combined a previously unpublished conversation between Hamel and Lhasa with interviews and responses to the conversation by band members and friends. The documentary was aired January 1, 2013, on CBC's Inside The Music. In 2014, a park located in her home neighbourhood Mile End, Montreal was renamed to commemorate her.

Life He was born in Glamorganshire, and adopted the profession of mining engineer. In 1845 he entered the service of Mehemet Ali, and was employed in examining Upper Egypt, Nubia, the Red Sea coast and Kordofan in an unsuccessful search for coal. In 1848 Petherick left the Egyptian service and established himself at El Obeid, the capital of Kordofan, as a trader, dealing largely in gum arabic. He was at the same time made British consular agent for the Sudan. In 1853 he removed to Khartoum and became an ivory trader. He travelled extensively in the Bahr-el-Ghazal region, then almost unknown, exploring the Jur River, Yalo and other affluents of the Bahr el Ghazal river. In 1858 he penetrated to the Niam-Niam country. His additions to the knowledge of natural history were considerable. Petherick returned to England in 1859 where he made the acquaintance of JH Speke, then arranging for his expedition to discover the source of the Nile. While in England Petherick married, and published an account of his travels. He returned to the Sudan in 1861, accompanied by his wife and with the rank of consul. He was entrusted with a mission by the Royal Geographical Society to convey to Gondokoro relief stores for Captains Speke and Grant. Petherick got boats to Gondokoro in 1862, but Speke and Grant had not arrived. Having arranged for a native force to proceed south to get in touch with the absentees, a task successfully accomplished, Mr and Mrs Petherick undertook another journey in the Bahr-el-Ghazal, making important collections of plants and fishes. They regained Gondokoro (where one of their boats with stores was already stationed) in February 1863, four days after the arrival of Speke and Grant, who had meantime accepted the hospitality of Mr (afterwards Sir) Samuel Baker. Speke later publicly accused Petherick of failing to fulfill his commitment. Speke and members of the white community in Khartoum also accused Petherick of involvement in the slave trade. In this the Europeans may perversely have been motivated by Petherick's interference in their commercial activities; slavery was deeply entwined with the local economy. Petherick's own business involved collaboration with slavers; he also made some efforts to disrupt slave trading. Despite or because of the complex reality Earl Russell, then secretary for foreign affairs, abolished the British consulate at Khartoum in 1864.

Viareggio () is a city and comune in northern Tuscany, Italy, on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. With a population of over 62,000, it is the second largest city within the province of Lucca, after Lucca. It is known as a seaside resort as well as being the home of the famous carnival of Viareggio (dating back to 1873), and its papier-m√¢ch√© floats, which (since 1925), parade along the promenade known as \\"Passeggiata a mare\\", in the weeks of Carnival. The symbol of the carnival of Viareggio and its official mask is Burlamacco, designed and invented by Uberto Bonetti in 1930. The city traces its roots back to the first half of the 16th century when it became the only gate to the sea for the Republic of Lucca. The oldest building in Viareggio, known as Torre Matilde, dates back to this time and was built by the Lucchesi in 1541 as a defensive fortification to fight the constant menace of corsair incursions. Viareggio is also an active industrial and manufacturing centre; its shipbuilding industry has long been renowned around the world and its fishing and floricultural industries are still fundamental sectors to the city's economy. Viareggio hosts the Premio letterario Viareggio R√©paci for literature, established in 1929. Amongst the other events organized around the year, it is worth mentioning the Festival Gaber, which has been held every August since 2004 to celebrate the memory of Giorgio Gaber, and is attended by several high-profile Italian musicians. Geography The entire area of Viareggio extends over the coastal flooding plain of Versilia. Located on the Ligurian Sea (although traditionally considered to face the Tyrrhenian Sea), it has of sandy beaches, of which are managed by private beach resorts and the remaining are public (most of the public beach is part of the Parco Naturale Regionale Migliarino- San Rossore-Massaciuccoli. Viareggio borders the local municipalities of Camaiore, Massarosa and Vecchiano) (PI). The municipal area comprises the Lake of Massaciuccoli and several canals, the most important ones of which are known as Burlamacca, Farabola, Fossa dell'Abate (bordering the municipality of Camaiore), and Fosso Le Quindici. =Climate= The climate is characterised by high levels of humidity (between 60 and 80% of relative humidity in the summer months) and a yearly rainfall off as a result of the proximity of the Apuanian Alps to the coast. The main winds blow from the south-east, the Libeccio and the Ponente which batter the coast for two to three days in a row and cause severe storms. During winter months (Dec-Feb), high temperatures can vary between and , while night time temperatures can reach below . In the summer (Jun-Aug), temperatures peak around . The very high summer humidity (average 70%) and low cloud cover can mean that the heat index temperature is or more higher than the air temperature. *Climatic classification: zone D, 1416 GR/G *Atmospheric diffusivity: low, Ibimet CNR 2002 History =Ancient and medieval ages= During the 3rd century BC, the mountains of Versilia were slowly invaded by the Ligurian tribes who, coming from the north, stretched their area of influence as far south as the river Arno. In 180 BC the Romans defeated the Ligurians and started colonising the Versilia (the areas known today as Massaciuccoli, Camaiore, Pietrasanta). The most widely accepted theory recognises the city's name as deriving from the Latin Via Regis (\\"Kings' Road\\"), the name of the Medieval road linking the fortification built on the beach to Lucca. According to other historians, instead, the name derives from Vicus Regius. This theory is based on the fact that in imperial times, there was a small inhabited centre (vicus) in the area known as \\"Gli Ortacci\\" which belonged to the empire, hence regius (\\"Royal\\"). Several hillside towns started developing in the Middle Ages, some of which are still active. The area currently hosting the city of Viareggio was still marshland and not inhabited. Around 1000 A.D. the first hostilities between Lucca and Pisa arose, aimed at gaining control over the coast of the Versila, which since the High Middle Ages had been nothing more than a forest owned by feudal lords in constant rivalry with each other. The Burlamacca canal and the old lighthouse. The first mention of Viareggio dates back to 1169 when a wooden tower guarding the coast was built. A little over two years later, in (1172) a military building named Turris de Via Regia was erected, taking its name from the road that linked it to Lucca (known today as via Montramito). In the following years the area around Viareggio, was involved in the hostilities between Pisa and Lucca, in their attempt to gain control over the coastal area. The conflict was spurred by the desire of the Lucchesi to finally gain access to the sea, and to the Pisane fear of the economic competition of its rival city. It is during these years that the feudal Lords of Versilia were forced to abdicate in favour of Castruccio Castracani. In the following years the area upon which Viareggio would eventually be built was marked by a number of minor battles, invasions and pillages. In addition, the area was also affected by the pestilence which, recounted by Giovanni Boccaccio in his masterpiece the Decameron, spread throughout the whole of Italy. =15th through 17th centuries= In these years Florence expanded its control over Tuscany. Lucca, however, managed to maintain its independence in exchange for hefty financial penalties. On September 10, 1513, Pope Leo X removed the port of Motrone from the control of Lucca. This directly affected the future of Viareggio which, from that moment, became the focus of Lucca's efforts to turn the town into its centre for commercial activities, and, in addition to the square-plan tower erected in (1534) with the aim to protect the port, several settlements started appearing. The 17th century was perhaps one of the most difficult periods for the 300 inhabitants of Viareggio; the area was insalubrious, malaria and other deadly epidemic diseases made the lives of fishermen and farmers extremely difficult. Lucca, on the other hand, increased its efforts to drain the marshlands to improve quality of life and encouraged migration to the new town. Slowly Viareggio changed its appearance; two small churches and as many factories were built, followed by a number of small shops. Meanwhile, its port became more active, while the cultivation of the drained fields started. =18th and 19th centuries= Principe di Piemonte Hotel. In 1701 Viareggio became a comune (municipality). In 1739, thanks to the work of hydraulics engineer Bernardino Zendrini the marshlands were finally completely drained and the town turned into a place where noblemen from Lucca would come and build their palaces. In May 1799 Viareggio was the centre of a popular uprising against the Jacobins. With the invasion of Italy by Napoleon the Lucchese state was turned into a principality whose sovereignty was given to Felice Baciocchi, although the real power was in the hands of Napoleon's older sister, Elisa. Elisa's government was characterised by unpopular measures such as those against the ecclesiastic patrimony. Similarly, most of her financial policies were of dubious effect, although some were welcomed by the locals, such as the adoption of the \\"Napoleonic Code\\", the adoption of the metric system, the introduction of mandatory vaccination against smallpox. With the fall of Napoleon and Baciocchi, Viareggio was the centre of several acts of violence. In March 1814 the population openly protested against the French, an event which turned into acts of pure vandalism. Viareggio remained under the control of the Austrians until 1817 when, as part of the agreements from Congress of Vienna, Maria Luisa of Spain was assigned the new Duchy of Lucca. The years to come would wipe out any good action that had been taken during the Napoleonic rule, although the new ruler would contribute to the town's expansion by building its first marina (seaside). In 1820 Viareggio obtained the status of city. Following the death of his mother (March 13, 1824), Charles Louis of Parma took over the government of Lucca and greatly contributed to Viareggio's expansion, by building a new church, a royal casino and two beach resorts, the first ones to be built in Viareggio. On October 5, 1847 Lucca was acquired by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Viareggio, in this new scenario, developed as a seaside resort for the whole of Tuscany. In 1848 the city adopted its current coat of arms. In these years Viareggio was the destination of many exiled intellectuals of the Italian Risorgimento who were tolerated by the local sovereigns. During these years Viareggio's economy saw a very rapid expansion through its already recognised beach tourism and the newly expanding sailboat industry. Its population increased from 300 in 1740 to 6,549 in 1841. =20th century= The beginning of the 20th century saw again a marked development of the coast and tourism industry which determined a drastic change to most of the beach. The Passeggiata or promenade was born, with its caf√©s and shops, contributing to turning the city into the \\"Pearl of the Tyrrhenian Sea\\". Wood was very widely used in most building and, in 1917, a large portion of the city was lost in fire in only one night. It was only during the fascist era that wood would finally be replaced by other materials. During World War II Viareggio was subject to heavy bombings and entire suburbs of the city were destroyed. After the war, the reconstruction could finally begin, but the city had changed its appearance dramatically. Today Viareggio is still a renowned seaside resort and is widely famous for its carnival and shipbuilding industry. =21st century= Late in the evening of June 29, 2009, a train carrying liquified petroleum gas derailed while approaching Viareggio's railway station. The ensuing explosion killed 32 people, injured many others, and destroyed a large number of homes and families near the station. Statue of Burlamacco on Belvedere delle Maschere.

Viareggio can be reached by car from the A11 (Firenze-Mare) motorway, via the A11/\\"Bretella\\" Lucca-Viareggio link road or A12 (Genoa-Rosignano) motorway. Viareggio railway station is located near the city center, with 60 daily trains running along the Rome‚ÄìPisa‚ÄìLa Spezia‚ÄìGenoa line, and the line to Florence, as well as international trains. The nearest airport is Pisa's \\"Galileo Galilei\\" international airport, just south of Viareggio's city center. Florence's \\"Amerigo Vespucci\\" airport is to the east. =Port and marina= Two extensions to today's Burlamacca canal were built in 1577. It is on its banks that the first maritime activities developed In 1740, Bernardino Zendrini had a water-gate built in order to prevent the sea water from arriving to lake Massaciuccoli. In 1820 Maria Luisa, duchess of Lucca had the first marina of Viareggio built, which was completed in 1823, and took the name of Marina of Lucca. Between 1871 and 1873 the so-called Marina of Tuscany was built, then followed by the Marina of Italy, 1907 through to 1911. In 1938 the Marina of the Empire was also built, which was followed in the 1970s by the Marina of Viareggio (also known as the New Marina), the Marina of the Madonnina, and the new lighthouse. The Madonnina can host up to 500 vessels. The city hosts the local Capitaneria di Porto, and all vessels registered here bear the marking VG. Economy The primary sectors of Vieraggio's economy are tourism, commerce and services, include fishing and floriculture (the flowers of Versilia). The city also houses prolific shipyards. At the beginning of the 19th century the craftsmen from Viareggio used to build small fishing vessels along the banks of the Burlamacca canal. As the century moved on, however, this small shipbuilding activity prospered until it became an internationally acclaimed centre. Nowadays, Viareggio represents the main luxury yachts producer city in the world thanks to the presence in the territory of shipyards like Azimut Benetti, Codecasa, Fipa, Rossinavi, Perini navi and many others. Culture =Carnival= The Carnival of Viareggio was established in 1873, while the now ever-present papier m√¢ch√© ‚Äì used to build the floats featured during its parades ‚Äì was first introduced in 1925. The official masks of the Carnival are Burlamacco and Ondina, drawn for the first time in 1930. Since 1954, RAI broadcasts the entire event on national TV. Since 2001, the craftsmen of the carnival have moved to the Cittadella del Carnevale or, literally, Carnival Town. =Prizes= *Premio letterario Viareggio Repaci, a literary award founded in 1929 by Leonida R√®paci, Alberto Colantuoni and Carlo Salsa. *Premio internazionale Artiglio. *Premio Sport Citt√† di Viareggio. *Premio Viareggio Sport. =Events= *Festival Puccini (held in Torre del Lago Puccini).

Sport The city is home of the roller hockey team CGC Viareggio. CGC Viareggio was the first club of Lucca province to be champion, in Italian sport. In 2011, got for the city the Lega Nazionale Hockey title. The association football team is F.C. Esperia Viareggio. It also has its own professional beach soccer team Viareggio Beach Soccer. Administrative subdivisions Viareggio has a single frazione, Torre del Lago Puccini, having a population of around 11,000. The city itself is subdivided into four Circoscrizioni: *Circoscrizione no. 1: Torre del Lago Puccini. *Circoscrizione no. 2: Centro Marco Polo. *Circoscrizione no. 3: Darsena/ex Campo d'Aviazione. *Circoscrizione no. 4: Viareggio Nuova. Coat of arms The current coat of arms was chosen in 1848 and replaces the previous one dating back to 1752, which showed an image of Saint Anthony from Padua, the first patron saint of the city.

It was signed by Tuli≈°en and Count Sava Lukich Raguzinskii-Vladislavich at the border city of Kyakhta on 23 August 1727. Results *Diplomatic and trade relations were established that lasted until the mid-19 century. *It established the northern border of Mongolia (what was then part of the Qing-Russian border). *The caravan trade from Kyakhta opened up (Russian furs for Chinese tea). *Agreement with Russia helped China expand westward and annex Xinjiang. Qing subjects are referred to as those from \\"Dulimbai gurun\\" in Manchu in the Treaty. Background By the 1640s Russian adventurers had taken control of the forested area north of Mongolia and Manchuria. From 1644 the Manchus made themselves masters of China (Qing dynasty). In 1689 the Treaty of Nerchinsk established the northern border of Manchuria north of the present line. The Russians retained Trans- Baikalia between Lake Baikal and the Argun River north of Mongolia. At the time of Nerchinsk what is now Mongolia had just been captured by the Oirat Dzungar Khanate. These people were gradually pushed back westward. This raised the question of the Russo-Manchu border in Mongolia and opened the possibility of trade from the Lake Baikal area to Peking. The Manchus wanted an agreement because they were worried about possible Russian support for the Oirats and did not want disobedient subjects fleeing to the Russians. Many of the Cossacks in Siberia were rather close to bandits and could cause trouble if not restrained by the Tsar. The Russians had neither a reason nor the means to push south and were more interested in profitable trade. The Russians had no hope of sending a serious army this far east and the Manchus had no interest in the frozen forests of Siberia. Negotiations From the 1710s the Kangxi Emperor began to put pressure on Saint Petersburg for an agreement, largely by interfering with the caravan trade. The Lev Izmailov mission in 1719/22 to Peking produced no results. Just before his death, Peter the Great decided to deal with the border problem. On 23 October 1725 Sava Vladislavich, a Serb in the Russian service, left Saint Petersburg with 1,500 soldiers and 120 staff including map-makers and priests. Before reaching Peking in November 1726, he picked up Lorenz Lange and Ivan Bucholz and sent out cartographers to survey the border. The negotiators on the Manchu side were Tulishen and Dominique Parrenin. After six months a draft treaty was worked up, but it became clear that neither side had adequate maps. In May Vladslavich and Tulishen went back to Selenginsk near Lake Baikal to get the waiting maps. By 31 August a draft treaty was drawn up ('Treaty of Bura' after a nearby river). Work quickly began setting up border markers starting from Kyakhta on the Selenga River.John Bell, (Travels from St Petersburg in Russia to diverse parts of Asia, Edinburgh, 1806, pages 227,230, 401), who was there in 1719 and 1722, said that the Russo-Manchu border was then at a place called Saratzyn 104 versts from Selinginsk and 467 versts from the Tola River. On page 236 he said that locals considered the Tola as the boundary. This fact, if it is a fact, does not seem to be in the standard histories. The 'Abagaitu Letter' listed 63 markers from Kyakhta east to the Argun River. The 'Selenginsk Letter' listed 24 markers west from Kyakhta to the \\"Shabindobaga River on the northwest slopes of the Altay Mountains\\" . The 'Treaty of Bura' was sent to Peking to be combined with work already done there. The result was sent back to the frontier and the Treaty of Kyakhta was signed on 25 June 1728. The treaty had three official versions, in Russian, in Latin and in Manchu. No official Chinese version of the treaty exists. Articles The treaty had eleven articles, the core of which dealt with commercial relations and diplomatic immunities. (This list, probably from Perdue, differs somewhat from the list given by March.) * Articles I and XI spoke of eternal peace and cooperation between the two nations, and concerned itself with the language and organization of the rest of the document. * Article II dealt with the exchange of fugitives. * Article III, along with VII, delineated the new borders, leaving only territory along the Irtysh River unassigned. The fate of this land, according to the treaty, would be determined in the future by ambassadors or further correspondence between the two nations' capitals. * Article VI dealt with commercial relations; from this treaty and others, Russia gained far more favorable commercial arrangements with the Chinese than most European countries, who traveled by sea and traded at Canton. Russia would send a caravan to Peking every three years and continuous border trade would be conducted at Kyakhta and Tsurukaitu in Manchuria. See Kyakhta trade. * Article V allowed for the establishment of a Russian religious institution in Beijing. * Article VI, along with IX, concerned itself with the forms and modes of diplomatic intercourse between the two nations, both of which had complex systems of bureaucracy and protocol. * Article VIII, along with X, discussed the methods and procedures for settling future disputes. Convention of Kyakhta (1768) On 18October 1768 a Convention was signed modifying Article X of the original treaty making punishments more explicit. This was due to the Qing extermination of the Dzungar Khanate, which caused rebels including Amursana to flee across the border, and other problems which led the Chinese to curtail trade in 1762 and suspend it in 1765. Kyakhta International Protocol (1792) The Kyakhta trade between Qing and Russia was very important to Russia as one of its main sources of income. The Qing was aware of this and occasionally used to suspend the trade to exert pressure on the Russian rulers. In 1784 some Russian Buryats and the Uriankhais of the Qing together robbed the Chinese merchant in the Kh√∂vsg√∂l region. The Russian way of punishing the robbers irritated the Qing side and became a new reason to suspend the trade for 7 years. Over these seven years before the two empires came to mutual agreement many events occurred that expose problems in the relations between them.–¢—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –º–∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ –º–æ–Ω–≥–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Ä–∞: –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ —Å–æ–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ 2: tuÃáuÃákh ba odoo tÔ∏†sÔ∏°ag, Volume 2, p99 On 8 February 1792, they signed the \\"International Protocol\\" (known as \\"ÊÅ∞ÂÖãÂúñÂ∏ÇÁ¥Ñ\\" in Chinese) in Kyakhta which confirmed the validity of the Sino-Russian Treaty of Kyakhta.History of Economic Relations Between Russia and China, by Mikhail Iosifovich Sladkovskiƒ≠, p286 Notes References *Mancall, Mark.

Historically in Cheshire, it borders Cheadle Hulme, Gatley, Heald Green and Cheadle Heath in Stockport, and East Didsbury in Manchester. , it had a population of 14,698. History There has been human occupation in the area that is now Cheadle since prehistoric times. The earliest evidence of civilisation is of burial mounds dating from the Iron Age, belonging to Celts who occupied Britain. Later, the area was occupied by Brigantes, whose activity was discovered in the form of axe fragments. In the first millennium, Romans occupied the area, and their coins have been discovered. During the 7th century St. Chad preached in the area,Clarke, p.1 and a stone cross dedicated to him was found close to the confluence of the River Mersey and Micker Brook in 1873.Squire, p.1 The village is first recorded in the Domesday Book under the name \\"Cedde\\",Clarke, p.3 which comes from the Celtic word for \\"wood\\". It was held by Gamel, a free Saxon under Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester; it was about three miles long and half as wide, containing both wooded and open land, with areas enclosed for hunting purposes. This early manor occupied the approximate areas of both modern day Cheadle and Cheadle Hulme. By June 1294, Geoffrey de Chedle was lord of the manor, and it was valued at about ¬£20 per annum. Geoffrey's descendant Robert (or Roger) died in the early 1320s, leaving the estate to his wife Matilda who held it until her death in 1326. As there were no male heirs the manor, which was now worth ¬£30 per annum,Squire, p.2 was divided between her daughters, Clemence and Agnes. Agnes inherited the northern half (which would later become the modern-day Cheadle), and Clemence inherited the southern half (latterly Cheadle Hulme). The two areas became known as \\"Chedle Bulkeley\\" and \\"Chedle Holme\\" respectively. William de Bulkeley succeeded his mother, and was a participant in several wars in France for Edward, the Black Prince. His son, Richard, was sent to live at the court Richard II, and later to a baron whose daughter Margery married Richard. Richard died at the age of 21, but Margery lived until she was around 90 years old. She was succeeded by her grandson and great-grandson, both named William. Shortly after the Battle of Bosworth, the latter William was succeeded by his brother Richard.Clarke, p.4 During the reign of Henry VIII, the current St Mary's Church on High Street was built.Clarke, p.5 There has been a church on the site since the 12th century, the original being constructed of wood, but it was rebuilt in stone between 1520 and 1550. The church contains an effigy of John Stanley who, along with many other men from the area, fought in the Battle of Flodden. Later he claimed the manor for himself, but was imprisoned by Thomas Wolsey who ensured the land went to its rightful owner.Clarke, p.6 The Bulkeleys continued to hold the lands as lords of the manor until the 18th century, when the manor was purchased by Thomas Egerton. During the uprising of Bonnie Prince Charlie (the \\"Young Pretender\\"), his troops marched through Cheadle. Some remains have been found, including swords. Gatley Road, Cheadle in 1908 Moseley Old Hall, an early Stuart mansion dating from 1666 is still standing and is owned privately. It is situated at the end of a blocked-off public road, making hard to find and therefore quite unheard of. Abney Hall is a late Victorian hall from 1847 and is the old Cheadle town hall, though is now used for offices. It is surrounded by parkland which is open to the public all year round and features some of the only wetlands left in Stockport. Cheadle grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution when it was used as a stopping point for travellers and merchants on their way to central Manchester. Geography Cheadle is a suburban village in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, from Stockport town centre and from Manchester city centre. It is close to Manchester Airport. Cheadle lies on the Cheshire Plain in the final meander of the Ladybrook Valley before it joins the River Mersey to the north. Cheadle is on the A560 from Stockport to Chester and borders onto the A34. Its geology is boulder clay and gravels: the parkland of Abney Hall to the north is on the flood plain of the Mersey. Governance Lying within the historic county boundaries of Cheshire, Cheadle was an ancient parish in the Hundred of Stockport. The parish included the townships of Cheadle Bulkeley and Cheadle Moseley (which included Cheadle Hulme). Following the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, part of Cheadle Bulkeley was amalgamated into the Municipal Borough of Stockport. Cheadle Bulkeley and Cheadle Moseley became separate civil parishes in 1866, but in 1879 they were united to form the civil parish of Cheadle.GENUKI: Cheadle BulkeleyGENUKI: Cheadle Moseley In 1886, Cheadle was in the Cheadle and Gatley local board of health, a regulatory body responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation for the area of Stockport Etchells township and the part of Cheadle township outside the Municipal Borough of Stockport. The board of health was also part of Stockport poor law union. In 1888 the board was divided into four wards: Adswood, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme and Gatley.Bowden, p.25 Under the Local Government Act 1894 the area of the local board became Cheadle and Gatley Urban District. There were exchanges of land with the neighbouring former urban districts of Wilmslow and Handforth in 1901, and the wards were restructured again, splitting Cheadle Hulme into north and south, and merging in Adswood. Due to the fast-paced growth of the district, the wards were again restructured in 1930, with the addition of Heald Green. In 1940 the current wards of Adswood, Cheadle East, Cheadle West, Cheadle Hulme North, Cheadle Hulme South, Gatley and Heald Green were established.Bowden, p.27 Under the Local Government Act 1972 the Cheadle and Gately Urban District was abolished, and Cheadle has, since 1 April 1974, formed an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Since 1950, Cheadle has been part of the Cheadle parliamentary constituency.Craig, p.53 As of 2015, it is represented by Conservative MP Mary Robinson. The area (listed as Cheadle and Gatley) has three councillors who serve on the borough council, who are all Liberal Democrats. Transport Cheadle's public transport is now confined to buses operated by several firms. However, from 1866 until 1964, the locality was served by a Cheshire Lines Committee railway station (initially called Cheadle and, from 1950, Cheadle North) situated north of the village on the west side of Manchester Road. It was also served, from 1866 until 1917, by Cheadle LNWR a London & North Western Railway station located next to the railway overbridge near the centre of the village. Both stations were on lines leading from Altrincham to Stockport. Cheadle no longer has its own railway station, though there are stations in several neighbouring vicinities. Gatley railway station is approximately one mile west of Cheadle village and the neighbouring areas of East Didsbury (within the City of Manchester's boundaries), Cheadle Hulme and Heald Green all have stations themselves. Cheadle is accessed by junctions 2 and 3 of the M60 Manchester orbital motorway. It is approximately 4 miles from Manchester Airport. Housing A number of houses in Cheadle that were built in the 1800s still stand today, in a conservation area in the centre of the village. There is also a Manchester overspill council estate that was constructed shortly after the Second World War to rehouse families from the Victorian slums of inner-city Manchester. In April 2008, these homes were transferred to a housing association, Mossbank Homes.

Ugly Duckling's members include Dizzy Dustin (Dustin McFarland), Young Einstein (Rodney Pleasant Jr.) and Andy Cooper. The band decided to take the name Ugly Duckling because they felt like outcasts on the Southern California hip hop scene of the mid-1990s. According to the book How to Rap: the Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, it is one of the most prominent underground hip hop groups.Edwards, Paul. (2009) How to Rap: the Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC, Chicago Review Press, p. 316. History Each of the members of the group are from Long Beach, California. Dizzy, Einstein and Andy met each other through mutual friends and eventually began creating and performing music together. In 1995, the group self-released their first album Down The Road on cassette which was sent as promo copies to radio stations and began to build a local following. The original promos came from a rainbow pack of tapes and differ in colour.} In 1998, they independently released their debut 12\\" single \\"Fresh Mode\\" on their own Special Records imprint} which was licensed and eventually distributed worldwide and led to the band getting their first record deal with 1500/A&M;/Universal. Musical style The group's style is primarily a throwback to the kind of hip hop popular in the late 1980s and early ‚Äô90s. It uses samples (particularly drum breaks and loops) as the foundation of most tracks, whereas many modern artists have given up sampling in favor of synthesized sounds and drum-machine beats. The two MCs, Andy and Dizzy, frequently alternate lyrics and often punctuate each others lines, reminiscent of early groups like the Double Trouble, The Treacherous Three and Beastie Boys. Ugly Duckling is known for humorous and intelligent lyrics, \\"lampooning the excesses of modern hip hop\\", such as its obsession with sex and materialism. In live shows, the group's DJ Young Einstein employs complex scratching routines with vinyl instrumental records to provide the musical backdrop for the rappers unlike many modern hip hop groups who work from digital media. Einstein is also the owner of the group's unofficial mascot, the dookie gold rope, which is the subject of the song \\"Eye on the Gold Chain\\" and is worn by Einstein during live performances. They have performed in more than 30 countries including Canada, Australia, China, Japan, Korea, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia. Ugly Duckling's music demonstrates the contrast of having grown up in an area known for gangsta rap and inner-city themes while listening to a variety of music, much of which was anything but hardcore. The band's songs often incorporate themes such as love, forgiveness, and rejection of worldly values. Some songs include lyrics pertaining to the biblical end times, yet others express fondness for cannabis. They frequently use language reminiscent of early hip hop hyperbole, where the primary goal of lyrics was to brag and self promote in an exaggerated and often humorous fashion. Influences Ugly Duckling is influenced by a variety of artists including everything from old school hip hop groups to golden age hip hop artists. Their influences include groups like Run-DMC, Eric B. & Rakim, EPMD, and the Native Tongues groups A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, and Jungle Brothers. Other influences include Boogie Down Productions, Brand Nubian, Public Enemy, and countless others who were prominent during the development of early hip hop. The Ugly Duckling song \\"Do You Know What I'm Sayin,\\" from the 1999 release Fresh Mode, is made up entirely of lines and phrases from classic hip hop songs strung together in homage to some of their favorite tracks and artists. Appearances in media Their song \\"Smack\\" is featured on Tony Hawk's Project 8 video game and also on skater Paul Rodriguez Jr.'s Footage soundtrack. \\"Get on This\\" is featured in the movie Boiler Room, \\"Turn It Up\\" is featured in the movie Eurotrip, and \\"Something's Going Down Tonight\\" was featured in the kayaking film Means Of Production as well as the movie Drillbit Taylor. Ugly Duckling provides the intro music for Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy. In February 2015, \\"Smack\\" was used as the trailer music for Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway on British TV channel ITV. The group's music featured extensively in the BBC sitcom Ideal. Their song \\"Just A Little Samba\\" is featured in an advertisement for Visa shown in several European countries (UK, Germany, Sweden, etc.) during the 2014 World Cup football world championship. The song \\"Einstein Do It\\" is used in the preview trailer for the upcoming 2021 game Riders Republics.

Aviano is home to the C.R.O. (Oncological Referral Center), a cancer research centre, one of the few in Italy and reference point for north-eastern Italy. The Piancavallo ski resort is part of the municipality. History Although Aviano has been inhabited only since the 10th century AD, evidence of a human presence dates to before the Romans entered the area in 186 BC. Most historians believe that Aviano developed with a commercial center located where present day Aviano is situated and a cultural and defensive center in the castle area. Aviano was a possession of the Patriarchal State of Friuli until 1420, when it came under the influence of the Venetian Republic. Aviano became a part of the Italian State in 1866. Geography Although the village is located at the foot of the Carnic Prealpi, the municipality extends to an altitude of over above sea level, near the ski resort of Piancavallo and Busa Villotta. =Climate= Main sights =Religious buildings= *The Cathedral of San Zenone (Duomo), built between 1775 and 1832.

Transport Aviano is served by a station on the Sacile-Pinzano Railway: the Aviano railway station. The Sacile-Pinzano line connects the town of Sacile, on the Venice-Udine railway, to the village of Pinzano, on the Gemona del Friuli-Pinzano line. As of today, the service is limited from Sacile to Maniago. Aviano Air Base USAF F-16s in the Aviano air base. Aviano Air Base was established by Italy in 1911. The base was among the first ones available to Italian aviation. There has been an American presence at Aviano Air Base since the end of World War II. In 1954 the Italian and American governments signed a joint use agreement and by 1955, HQ United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) had moved its Italian operations from Udine to Aviano. The base went through a period of hosting rotational fighter squadrons. With the declining use of the Italian live fire range, the rotational squadrons became a thing of the past. Aviano became a war reserve material storage base and played a big part in Desert Storm. In 1992, HQ 16th Air Force and the 401st Fighter Wing moved from Torrejon Air Base, Spain to Aviano. The Wing became home to two F-16 fighter squadrons, the 510th FS and the 555th FS. Both squadrons relocated from Ramstein AB in 1994 and redesignated. The wing was redesignated from the 401st Fighter Wing to the 31st Fighter Wing in 1994 as Aviano took on permanently based aircraft for the first time in over 50 years. The base currently performs a NATO mission with close coordination with Italian personnel.

Geography  = Geographic location = Located on the verge of the Thuringian Basin just before the Thuringian Forest, Waltershausen is sometimes referred to as the \\"gate to the Thuringian Forest\\". It is close to the Gro√üer Inselsberg, the fourth-highest mountain in the state. = Town structure = The town is divided into the seven districts of Fischbach, Schmerbach, Schwarzhausen, Winterstein, Wahlwinkel, Schnepfenthal and Langenhain. = incorporations = On July 1 in 1950, Langenhain, Schnepfenthal-R√∂dichen as well as Wahlwinkel became parts of Waltershausen. 63 years later, on December 31 in 2013, the district of Emsetal (consisting of Fischbach, Schmerbach, Schwarzhausen and Winterstein) was incorporated into the town.  History  The origin of the town's name can be traced back to the 8th-9th century when, during Franconian times, a settlement called Waltershausen existed. In 1167, the town's landmark Tenneberg Castle was first mentioned in a document. The first documentary mention of Waltershausen itself dates back to 1209, precisely under the name of ‚ÄûUlricus,villicius de Waltheri√ühusin‚Äú. It was then a part of the county of M√ºhlburg under the electorate of Mainz. From 1640 onwards, Waltershausen, then a subordinate to the Amt Tenneberg, became a part of the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In the early nineteenth century, Waltershausen established its tradition of being a \\"city of dolls\\" due to the high number of toy and specifically doll factories in the area. In 1990, however, the industrial production of dolls came to an end. In 1929, the Thuringian forest railway was extended to Waltershausen, thus providing a direct connection to Bad Tabarz and Gotha. During World War II, on February 6 in 1945, Waltershausen was among several regional towns to be hit by an attack of U.S. Forces. 12 bombers dropped a total of 120 bombs on the town, causing the destruction of 21 buildings as well as 20 casualties.  Culture  = Landmarks and sights = * Schloss Tenneberg, a baroque castle along with a local history museum. * Klaustor, the main gate of the former city wall. * T√∂pfersturm (German for pottery tower), the former workplace of medieval potters outside of the town's center. * historic Townhall, built in 1441 and fundamentally restored in 1990, the second oldest half-timbered town hall in central Germany.Town hall * Schnepfenthal Salzmann School (Salzmannschule Schnepfenthal), a boarding school specializing in foreign language education. * the first outdoor gymnastic ground of Germany, founded by Johann Christoph Friedrich GutsMuths. * town church (1719‚Äì23), including the largest baroque organ in the state of Thuringia. = Sports = Waltershausen offers a variety of sports clubs competing on high levels. Karate athletes of Bushido Waltershausen regularly compete on the national and international stage and have won numerous titles over the years. The town is also a well-known host of regional as well as national table tennis competitions. Its central sports club, ZSG Waltershausen consists of 12 different sports departments. = Media = There are two renowned radio stations in Waltershausen. In 2009, the online radio channel 0800 Radio Tenneberg went on air with daily coverage. Four years later, TMR- radio.de launched, providing recent news and a variety of music. = Recurring events = Waltershausen's Christmas market The town's biggest event is the annual town fair, taking place in mid-July under a different motto each year. Another recurring event is the medieval castle fair at the beginning of each September. In December, usually on the weekend of second advent, the annual Christmas market takes place in front of the town hall. A day before Carnival's Monday, a traditional Carnival's parade has been held in Waltershausen for over 25 years. = Religion = There are a total of seven churches and chapels in Waltershausen and its surrounding districts. With the exception of a Catholic chapel established during the 20th century in the town, all of the religious institutions are of Protestant Christianity. In 1993, Waltershausen became an ecclesiastical administrative center as chair of the Protestant-Lutheran church association of Waltershausen-Ohrdruf.  Infrastructure  = Industry = The local economy is highly dependent on its industrial institutions. There are several companies located in or around Waltershausen. One of the most significant examples is a factory by Hako GmbH, where multifunctional equipment transporters called Multicars are being produced. Rockinger, a trailer hitch producing company, has a factory as well as its headquarters in the town. ContiTech, a subsidiary of Continental, also settled in Waltershausen with one of its factories. = Public transport = Th√ºringer Waldbahn Due to its proximity to the highway A4 and its own entry to one of Germany's most significant highways connecting Frankfurt and Dresden, Waltershausen is well-connected to the surrounding cities of Eisenach, Gotha as well as Erfurt. The highway is also the gateway to various other parts of Germany, making the Waltershausen a very central and easily accessible place from a national perspective. One of the best-known public transport mediums in the area is the Th√ºringer Waldbahn, connecting Waltershausen to Gotha and Bad Tabarz. Its traditional and nostalgic concept have made it popular beyond the town's border, attracting even non-local tourists. There are buses and a train line operating in Waltershausen as well. = Education = Waltershausen currently has two primary schools, a secondary school as well as the Salzmannschule Schnepfenthal, a high school focussing on foreign language education.

It was designed by Carl Alexander Heideloff and its name means \\"shining stone\\" or \\"bright stone\\". The castle overlooks the Echaz valley near Honau, Reutlingen in the state of Baden- W√ºrttemberg. The modern castle was inspired by the novel Lichtenstein (1826) by Wilhelm Hauff and was built in 1840‚Äì1842. The ruins of an older medieval castle are a few hundred meters away. Geography The castle is located on an escarpment that marks the northwestern edge of the Swabian Jura. It is in the Reutlingen district and has an altitude of . and about above the Echaz river, a small tributary of the Neckar river. The ruins of Lichtenstein Castle's medieval predecessor, the Burg Alt-Lichtenstein, lies away. History Demolition of the old lodge, 1839 Beginning around 1100, a castle belonging to a family of ministerials of the counts of Achalm and later counts of W√ºrttemberg, was located on the escarpment above the source of the river Echaz. The castle and its denizens, the lords of Lichtenstein, were not friendly with the Free Imperial City of Reutlingen and were thus under frequent attack. The old castle was destroyed twice, once during the imperial civil war of 1311 and again by the citizens of Reutlingen sometime between 1377 and 1381. A new castle was built in 1390 some from the ruins of the old one. The site selected was the same as that of the current structure. It was one of the most impressive fortifications of the Late Middle Ages. Despite such features as early casemates that made it nearly unassailable, the castle ceased to be the ducal seat in 1567 and fell into disrepair. During the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì48), it was taken over by the Tyrolean line of the Habsburgs following the death of the last member of the Lichtenstein family in 1687 during the Great Turkish War. The coat of arms of their family, a pair of golden angel wings on a blue background, is still displayed in the Great Hall of the castle. In 1802, King Frederick I of W√ºrttemberg came into possession of the castle, dismantled it to its foundations and replaced it with a hunting lodge. =Modern castle= Master of Lichtenstein located in the castle. As a consequence of 19th-century Romanticism, medieval virtues like chivalry became increasingly popular among the elites. Parallel to this, medieval architecture, primarily Gothic style, returned to public attention in Germany with the unfinished Cologne Cathedral, leading to the rise of Gothic Revival architecture.The importance of the Cologne completion project in German- speaking lands has been explored by Michael J. Lewis, \\"The Politics of the German Gothic Revival: August Reichensperger\\". Other notable examples of this romantic infatuation with medieval structures and architecture are the Votive Church of Vienna and Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria. This nostalgic longing for the medieval past, spurred on by the works of authors such as Hugh Walpole, Sir Walter Scott, and John Ruskin, meant that architectural had once again turned from the Classical to the Gothic style of architecture. In 1826, German poet and patriot Wilhelm Hauff published his book Lichtenstein, in which the castle, the book's namesake, played a major role.Lichtenstein by Wilhelm Hauff at Project GutenbergDK Publishing, p. 301 Hauff's novel was inspired by the historical romances of Walter Scott, some of which Hauff reviewed and wrote a parody about.Stefan Kn√∂dler: \\"Heute geholt und morgen zur√ºkgegeben\\" in: Archiv f√ºr Geschichte des Buchwesens, vol. 70, 2015, p. 260] King Frederick's cousin, Count (later Duke) Wilhelm von Urach, a German patriot, who was very interested in medieval history, art, and architecture, was so inspired by the book that he purchased the estate ‚Äì at that time merely another crumbling ruin in the Swabian Jura ‚Äì from the king in 1837, after negotiations for the purchase with the resident groundskeeper Philipp Freiherr von H√ºgel and his successor. Negotiations for the purchase of the hunting lodge of 1802 inventory GU 20: Lichtenstein Castle: construction, use and management, 1. Background to the Castle building: purchase negotiations. Desiring an accurate emulation of a medieval castle to live in and house his substantial collection of medieval arts, arms, and armor, Wilhelm recruited architect and restorationist Carl Alexander Heideloff after turning down designs by W√ºrttemberg court painter Franz Seraph Stirnbrand and Christian Wilhelm von Faber du Faur ‚Äì designs that differed substantially from today's structure. Construction of the New Lichtenstein Castle began in 1840 and was managed by . This structure, its design heavily influenced by Count Wilhelm, used the ancient foundations of the castle of 1390, and stood up to three stories tall, with a curtain wall and courtyard to complete the castle complex. A barbican and a sprawling outer bailey, complete with corner bastions and turrets, was constructed in 1857. Following this, the castle was then decorated within and without by Nuremberg painter and architect .Hartig, pp.98‚Äì106 The most important works in the castle are \\"Death of the Virgin Mary\\" by Michael Wolgemut and two altar panels by an unknown Austrian artist called the \\"Master of Lichtenstein.\\"Katritzki, Katritzki, The World of Private Castles, Palaces and Estates, volume 1, 2005, p. 66. The castle was completed in 1842, and the king was present for its inauguration ceremony. In 1869, it became the official residence of the dukes of Urach. After the Revolution of 1848, then-Count Wilhelm became the first duke of Urach. A passionate artillery officer, he desired to improve the defenses of his castle and so began to build pre-outwork caponiers in the style of the imperial Fortress of Ulm (though not on a scale as grand) and a trench along the fortress to deter attack. Later he had cannons placed in the bastions on the walls.Ottersbach, pp. 100‚Äì120 From 1898 to 1901 the two buildings left of the main gate, the Ducal Palace and the old groundskeepers house, were constructed and expanded respectively. A motion to build a cableway up to the castle in 1911 was rejected because it was believed it would ruin the beauty of the castle. Outer bailey structure =Restoration= The castle was damaged during World War II, but efforts to restore it began in the immediate aftermath of the war. Once again, and thanks to local non-profit organizations like the W√ºstenrot Foundation and Community Fund for the Preservation of Lichtenstein Castle, the walls were restored in 1980, followed by the second floor in 1998. The upper floor and roof were restored in 2002. In popular culture The castle on its escarpment * Lichtenstein Castle has appeared on various postage stamps. In the late 1940s, during the French occupation of this area of Germany, authorities issued a series of stamps that included an 84-Reichspfennig stamp showing the castle, and the Deutsche Bundespost Berlin issued a 35-pfennig stamp depicting the castle in 1982. *2009: Lichtenstein was used for the filming of Dornr√∂schen, a German adaption of the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty. *Lichtenstein Castle is the inspiration for Cammy's home stage in the arcade game, Super Street Fighter II. Recreations The Old Vanderburgh County Jail in Evansville, Indiana is modeled after Lichtenstein Castle. The \\"Leckzapfen\\" vineyard house constructed at Osthofen in 1891 in Worms in Rhenish Hesse is almost a miniature version of the main building of Lichtenstein Castle. Reynier Fritz, a German-born Cape Town business man saw the castle and decided to replicate it in upon his return to Hout Bay, South Africa. He started building in 1986 and in 1998 it was completed, He eventually turned it into a guest house before dying there. Some time after his death, his widow sold it to an overseas buyer. Allegedly haunted, the castle is one of the area's most popular attractions. In 2012, the castle was sold for 23 million Rand to a Russian business man.

ITV has a long tradition of television news. Independent Television News (ITN) was founded to provide news bulletins for the network in 1955, and has since continued to produce all news programmes on ITV. The channel's news coverage has won awards from the Royal Television Society, Emmy Awards and BAFTAs. Between 2004 and 2008, the ITV Evening News held the title of \\"RTS News Programme of the Year\\". The flagship ITV News at Ten has won numerous BAFTA awards, and also being named \\"RTS News Programme of the Year\\" in 2011 and 2015. ITV News has the second-largest television news audience in the United Kingdom, second only to BBC News (and followed by other broadcasters such as Sky News, Channel 4 News and 5 News). However, its ¬£43 millionITN to fight off Sky bid for ¬£43m TV news contract The Independent, 16 June 2001, Retrieved 13 April 2010ITN and ITV sign new six-year contract for ITV News ITN, 2 April 2007, Retrieved 13 April 2010 annual news budget is dwarfed by that of the publicly funded BBC, which spends ¬£89.5 million annually on news- gathering, plus a further ¬£23.1 million on its rolling news channel. Initially, all national news programmes on ITV carried ITN's own brand. As the ITV network consolidated from the mid 1990s onwards, ITN branding of news programmes was eventually dropped on 8 March 1999 following the introduction of the ITV News brand. ITN remains the producer of all the national ITV News programmes. History =September 1955 to July 1967= The original ITN logo, as used between 22 September 1955 to 15 November 1969 ITN was set up by the Independent Television Authority to provide a new type of news service for the upcoming commercial television service Independent Television (ITV). Both ITN and ITV were launched on 22 September 1955, and the news service immediately broke new ground by introducing in-vision newscasters and reporter packages (incidentally, the first roster of regular ITN newscasters and reporters included marathon runner Christopher Chataway, Robin Day, and Reginald Bosanquet). The unique, probing reporting style of Robin Day caused shock among politicians, finding themselves questioned continually for information ‚Äì this had never been the case with the BBC. ITN also boasted the first British female newsreader, Barbara Mandell, in 1956. Into the 1960s, reporters such as George Ffitch, Alastair Burnet, Gordon Honeycombe, Huw Thomas and Sandy Gall emerged as aspiring newscasters, under the leadership of editor Geoffrey Cox. The original ITN logo, featuring a large \\"T\\" flanked either side by \\"I\\" and \\"N\\" (all encased within an outlined circle), was used from 1955 up to 1970. The original ITN theme tune was an excerpt of Non-Stop, a piece of light music composed by John Malcolm, used from 1955 up to 1982. As the years went on, full-length ITN news programmes were launched with their own theme music and particular branding (first News at Ten, then First Report, and finally News at 5.45), meaning that by its end, Non-Stop was only in use on generic news bulletins mainly at weekends. =July 1967 to January 1991= In 1967, ITN editor Geoffrey Cox suggested launching a half-hour news bulletin for ITV, every weeknight. ITV executives, however, were sceptical of that idea, because it was thought that viewers would not want a full 30 minutes of news every Monday to Friday (there had only been one half-hour news programme in Britain previously ‚Äì BBC2's Newsroom, launched in 1964). However, the idea was approved on the condition it ran for a 13-week trial, and News at Ten was born on 3 July 1967. ITN's head newscasters ‚Äì Alastair Burnet, Andrew Gardner, and George Ffitch ‚Äì presented the first News at Ten, and the bulletin became so popular with viewers that it was kept in the schedules after its initial 13 weeks. The programme's titles used an excerpt of The Awakening, a piece of dramatic music composed by Johnny Pearson. The famous chimes of the Westminster Clock Tower ‚Äì affectionately known as the bongs ‚Äì separated each headline as it was read out. The early opening title sequences were simplistic; for the first two years, the ITN symbol faded into a wide studio shot showing the two newscasters at the desk, with the caption News at 10. Then, in 1969, a new title sequence was introduced: a slow pan of the Houses of Parliament was followed by a sharp zoom into the face of \\"Big Ben\\" showing the time of 22:00. The text \\"Independent Television News\\" was shown at the start of the sequence, followed by the individual words \\"NEWS\\", \\"at\\" and \\"TEN\\", which appeared in time to the title music. The sequence was amended a year later to feature the new ITN logo at the beginning. The logo, introduced in 1970, was a simple sans-serif outline of the phrase \\"ITN\\". The basic concept of the logo remains today. A still from an early News at Ten opening sequence from c. 1969. On 16 October 1972, a twenty-minute lunchtime bulletin was introduced into the ITV schedule ‚Äì First Report, which was hosted by Robert Kee and ran from 12:40 to 13:00. This was followed on 6 September 1976 by the introduction of a new evening bulletin, the News at 545, which ran from 17:45 to 18:00; Michael Nicholson and Leonard Parkin alternated in the newscaster chair. By this time, with three regular ITN bulletins throughout the day ‚Äì and each having their own look and specially composed music ‚Äì the original ITN Non-Stop theme music was only seen on generic summaries and weekend bulletins. In 1982, it was finally replaced with a synthesised alternative. First Report was moved to 13:00 and retitled News at One in 1976; Leonard Parkin and Peter Sissons alternated in the presenter's chair. Michael Nicholson continued as main newscaster of the News at 545, with Martyn Lewis replacing Parkin as the relief presenter. In 1986, Nicholson left newscasting to return to war reporting and was replaced by Alastair Stewart. Leonard Parkin retired in 1987, and Peter Sissons became a main newscaster for ITN's Channel 4 News (before moving to the BBC in 1989) ‚Äì it was at this point that the programme revamped. It was moved to 12:30, and appropriately became the News at 12:30. Julia Somerville joined ITN from the BBC's Nine O'Clock News to host the new programme, with John Suchet and Jon Snow acting as relief presenters. In 1988, the programme returned to its original slot and once again became the News at One; the presenting line-up remained unchanged. In 1989, Somerville left the programme to become a main presenter of News at Ten, leaving Suchet to become the main lunchtime newscaster ‚Äì the programme was revamped once more. In 1991, the programme moved back to the 12:30 slot, but retained the studio setting. In 1993, graphics were relaunched to bring it in line with other ITN news bulletins. News at 545 was replaced by the News at 540 in 1989 (following the introduction of the ITV National Weather forecast), and a new presenting team was formed comprising Carol Barnes, Nicholas Owen, Trevor McDonald, Fiona Armstrong, and Alastair Stewart. The programme lasted until March 1992 when it was renamed and relaunched, in line with other ITN bulletins. News at Ten continued to rate as the most popular news programme on television. In 1988, the programme launched specially made opening titles featuring a computer generated travel through London, up the River Thames until the camera stops at the \\"Big Ben\\" clockface. ITN's regular newscasting team in the 1980s included Alastair Burnet, Sandy Gall, Leonard Parkin, Alastair Stewart, Trevor McDonald, Julia Somerville, Carol Barnes, Fiona Armstrong, John Suchet, Nicholas Owen, and a host of well-known reporters and correspondents. =January 1991 to February 2004= In 1991, ITN moved into its new building at Gray's Inn Road, London (previously owned by The Sunday Times). From this year, ITN news programmes revamped and moved to be presented from the ITV newsroom, foremostly to show the impressive atrium in the newly purchased headquarters ‚Äì with the exception of the lunchtime programme which continued with its own studio and music, but took on elements of the new revamp ‚Äì such as the serif font style newly introduced for ITN bulletins. The News at 12:30 bulletin itself was renamed the Lunchtime News in 1992. The main lunchtime newscasters between 1992 and 1995 were Nicholas Owen and Carol Barnes. Dermot Murnaghan, Sonia Ruseler and Julia Somerville acted as relief newscasters until 1995, when Murnaghan and Somerville became the bulletin's regular newscasters. News at 540 was renamed the Early Evening News on 2 March 1992 and presented from the ITV newsroom adjacent to the ITN atrium. John Suchet was the main newscaster for the Early Evening News, and relief presenters included Carol Barnes, Nicholas Owen and Dermot Murnaghan. News at Ten underwent a revamp on 9 November 1992 after the departures of newscasters Alastair Burnet (in August 1991) and Sandy Gall (in early 1992, though he did remain at ITN filing special war reports for News at Ten). A new set was created for the programme, featuring television monitors, a large video screen, and a curved desk with \\"News at Ten\\" inscribed into it. Trevor McDonald became the sole newscaster of the programme. John Suchet, Dermot Murnaghan, and Julia Somerville were relief presenters for the bulletin. Initially, the new-look News at Ten was presented from the same studio as the Early Evening News, adjacent to the ITV newsroom. In 1995, all ITN programmes relaunched with a unified look, using blue colours (the corporate colour of ITN at the time). A new set was created in the former Early Evening News studio, adjacent to the atrium and next to the ITV newsroom. The glass walls were coated in semi-transparent blue perspex; the left wall looked onto the lobby of ITN's building, whilst the right showed the busy atmosphere of the ITV newsroom. Different variations on the theme music distinguished the main bulletins. Design firm Lambie-Nairn devised the new look, which saw special arrangements of the famous News at Ten music being used for the other bulletins (as composed by Dave Hewson). 1999 saw the biggest and largest change to news bulletins on ITV. On 8 March 1999, all ITN programmes were rebranded under the name ITV News. Under the leadership of Granada chairman Charles Allen, the channel also controversially decided to axe the flagship News at Ten bulletin. Replacing the 22:00 bulletin (and in turn the old 17:40 News at 540) as the flagship ITN programme was the ITV Evening News at 18:30 (fronted by Trevor McDonald). The ITV Nightly News was also introduced, presented by Dermot Murnaghan and airing at 23:00 every weeknight. However, the loss of News at Ten was a massive blow to both ITV and ITN. By the start of the year 2000, viewing figures for news programmes on ITV had dropped by about a million viewers due to the loss of the 22:00 bulletin. The regulating ITC ordered ITV to perform a review of the new news time slots and whether or not they were working. There was much opposition towards ITV from the viewing public, politicians such as Gerald Kaufman, former ITN faces including editor Nigel Ryan and newscaster Alastair Burnet, and some of ITN's then-current staff including political editor Michael Brunson. After a lengthy battle with the ITC, a half-hearted ITV News at Ten was introduced (hosted by McDonald) in January 2001, although as part of the agreement, the bulletin was only shown at 22:00 for 3 days a week to accommodate other programming. The programme returned with a massive 8 million viewers, but figures soon fell drastically. Cashing in on the 1999 loss of News at Ten, BBC director-general Greg Dyke announced that the Nine O'Clock News would be moved to 22:00. Whereas the 2001 ITV News at Ten was at 22:00 for only three nights a week, the BBC's Ten O'Clock News was a firm fixture at ten for six nights a week. ITV rarely started this incarnation of News at Ten on time; time starts ranging from 21:55 to 22:10 led to the programme being disparaged as \\"News at When?\\" and viewers soon switched to the BBC. Also in 2001, the ITN name was removed from the voiceovers at the start of bulletins and reporter name-checks. The ITN name and logo is now only seen on the production slide, and is only used in ITV bulletins when referring to footage shot by ITN camera teams working for other clients (for example: the ITN name is used when both News at Ten and Channel 4 News broadcast the same piece of footage). With the outbreak of warfare in Iraq in 2003, ITV replaced the ITV News at Ten with a special 45-minute-long ITV News at Nine every Monday to Friday, hosted by Trevor McDonald in Kuwait City and John Suchet in the ITV News studio in London. The News at Nine proved to be very popular, reaching 9.1 million viewers on the first night in comparison to the 5 to 6 million for the BBC's late evening news. The ITV Evening News was extended to 60 minutes, and various ITV news specials ran throughout the schedules. A simulcast of the ITV News Channel aired from 00:00 to 05:30 every night on ITV1. ITN also managed to persuade big name newscasters to return to the organisation to present the special war coverage on ITV: Alastair Stewart, Carol Barnes, Angela Rippon, Jon Nicholson and Anne Leuchars were all back presenting news bulletins and regular slots on the ITV News Channel. =February 2004 to January 2008= An example of the standing-up presentation discontinued from 2009 ‚Äì Geraint Vincent presenting an edition of the ITV Evening News in late 2008 Since 2004, ITV plc's 40% stake in ITN has been held as part of (and the company's ITV News operations integrated into) the ITV News Group. The ITV News Group also comprises the ITV regions in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Channel Islands, as well as ITV Sport. Its director is Michael Jermey, formerly a programme editor with ITN. On 2 February 2004, ITV News unveiled a ¬£1 million virtual studio, with a rounded green screen (the set was nicknamed the \\"Theatre of News\\") for presenters to stand up in front of and present graphics to viewers. As part of the revamp, the ITV News at Ten was axed due to low ratings and replaced with the News at Ten Thirty, hosted once again by McDonald (from Monday-Thursday), and by Mark Austin on Fridays. The new programme did not fare any better in the ratings; News at Ten had once gained audiences of 10 million or more, though the News at Ten Thirty now struggled to reach 2 million viewers on any one night (though the flagship ITV Evening News regularly attracted audiences of around 6 million). In addition, ITV abandoned its 24-hour news channel towards the end of 2005, saying it was not \\"commercially viable\\". The ITV News Channel was replaced by men's channel ITV4 and the recently relaunched CITV channel in March 2006. On 16 January 2006, to reflect the launch of the new ITV logo, ITV News revamped with a teal-coloured look. The music was remixed to become slightly 'heavier', and new opening titles were made based around the famous Big Ben clock face (see right). A specially made VR view of the ITN atrium now adorned the \\"Theatre of News\\" screen (an earlier version had been used for ITV's Election 2005 a year previously). In November 2006, the teal- colours of the name-strap designs and other on-screen graphics ‚Äì including the atrium design ‚Äì were replaced with blue. The teal-coloured opening titles and stings remained unchanged. In April 2007 ITN announced that ITV had awarded it a 6-year contract to produce ITV News, at a cost of ¬£250 million. However, ITN announced that the new budget meant it would have to cut staff despite already operating on a smaller budget than its two main rivals BBC News and Sky News. On 2 December 2007, ITV News and the ITV regional newsrooms switched from the traditional 4:3 format to 16:9 widescreen. =January 2008 to November 2009= In 2007, ITV plc's newly appointed chairman Michael Grade was reported as saying that the axing of the original News at Ten was \\"the worst mistake ITV ever made\\"; not long afterwards, plans were made for the famous bulletin to return to ITV. News at Ten returned on 14 January 2008, with a revised version of the original theme tune, presented by Trevor McDonald (temporarily, until November of that year, after which point Mark Austin took over) and former Sky News presenter Julie Etchingham. The studio contained a VR view over night- time London (with an outline of the Big Ben clockface superimposed on top), with dark blue and black being the primary colour scheme; VR glass 'sheets' also provided News at Ten logos on them. In 2007, The Guardian reported that ITV planned to take its news output \\"back to basics\\" by paring back graphics and having newscasters adopt a more formal style of presenting from behind the desk instead of standing up. This was confirmed when, on 9 February 2009, ITN refreshed ITV News to bring it more in line with the News at Ten studio set. All news bulletins began to be presented from behind a desk; a VR view over London appeared as the backdrop (different coloured versions were used depending on the time of day). Continuing the cohesive look across all programmes, VR glass screens also appeared in the studio to provide graphics and live links with correspondents and reporters. Almost all of the teal- coloured graphics of 2006 were replaced with reworked blue versions to provide some consistency with the rest of the ITV News look, but the teal clockface opening animation remained on the ITV News-branded bulletins. Jib camera pans across the studio replaced the previous title sequence; these shots were pre- recorded 10 to 15 minutes before transmission, because it is a difficult shot to achieve and cannot be done if other studio cameras are already in place. In July 2009, to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the NASA moon landings, ITN produced five special 10-minute programmes for ITV titled Mission to the Moon ‚Äì News from 1969. The programmes took the form of news bulletins, reporting on the day's events of 1969. John Suchet, a former ITN newscaster, was the presenter of these specials; he was aided by a team of correspondents including Andrea Catherwood (who had left ITV News in 2006) and Peter Snow, who was an ITN newscaster and correspondent between 1962 and 1979. The first Mission to the Moon programme aired at 22:35 on ITV on Wednesday 15 July and continued the following Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday (Friday in Scotland, on STV). In August 2009, it was announced that after 16 years co- hosting London Tonight, Alastair Stewart was to leave the regional magazine programme to become the main co-anchor of the ITV Evening News. Mark Austin concentrates his energies on News at Ten but continues to present some editions of the 18:30 bulletin. It was also revealed that, following his successful stint as presenter of Election Night Live: America Decides in 2008, Stewart was to present the ITN/ITV coverage of the UK general election in 2010. The semi-circular \\"Theatre of News\\" studio set, in use for five years, was last broadcast on Sunday 1 November 2009. =November 2009 to January 2013= 120px On 22 October 2009, it was jointly announced by ITN and ITV that ITV News would be rebranded from Monday 2 November. At the heart of the revamp was the removal of the famous image of the Big Ben clock tower from the opening sequence of ITV News programmes including News at Ten; ITV executives felt, after \\"months of deliberation\\", that the imagery of the landmark promoted London-centricity to viewers outside the capital. A clockface remained as part of the studio backdrop and also appeared within the opening titles, and the headline bongs were also retained. The November revamp included a newly designed rectangular set and graphics featuring a colour scheme of black and gold to complement the ITV1 image and branding. A newly composed piece music called 'News Centre' was introduced, which incorporated only a few elements of 'The Awakening', the previous ITV News theme.ITV News: Vivid & Visual Brand Re-Alignment (2009) YouTube The ITV News revamp was developed by ITN, ITV and design agency Bruce Dunlop Associates. ITV-plc regional news programmes continued to use their studio sets introduced in 2004, but with an updated colourscheme and news titles reflecting the ITV News rebrand. In December 2009, ITV News at Ten won the award for Best National Television Programme from the Plain English Awards. In April 2010, it was announced that after 12 years working at ITN, Katie Derham was to leave the organisation to front the BBC's coverage of the Proms for BBC Two and BBC Radio 3. A spokesman for BBC Radio 3 confirmed the appointment but declined to give any further details. =January 2013 onwards= On 16 November 2012 it was announced ITV News would rebrand in January 2013.ITV reveals first details of major rebrand David Pidgeon, Media Tel, 16 November 2012 On 27 November 2012 it was understood the ITV News at 5:30 would be axed, in favour of delivering content for itv.com and creating a new foreign affairs unit.ITV axes Morning News bulletin Mark Sweney, The Guardian, 27 November 2012 The new look brought forth another rearrangement of signature tune The Awakening, more direct than its predecessors, and a new opening sequence featuring \\"Big Ben\\" marking the time for its respective news programmes; it also saw the ITN logo removed entirely, the production slide instead being the ITV News logo with \\"ITN year\\" in small type underneath. ='Big Ben' branding= The clockface appearing in the News at Ten titles from January 2008 to November 2009. Other bulletins used a stylised image Trademarks of ITN and ITV News are the inclusion of the Elizabeth Tower at the Houses of Parliament in its programme titles, along with the chimes of Big Ben (known popularly as the \\"bongs\\") between headlines. The \\"bongs\\" were originally introduced for News at Ten in 1967; the other ITN bulletins used different studio designs, individual graphic sets and individual music. In 1992, News at Ten was relaunched following the decision to move to a single newscaster ‚Äì Trevor McDonald won the role ‚Äì and composer Dave Hewson was assigned with the responsibility of musical changes. The famous theme tune was re-arranged by Hewson and re- recorded in a slightly higher pitch but the timpani and chimes remained. In 1995 ITN adopted a unified look for all ITV bulletins except News at Ten, extending the use of the Big Ben clockface and branding to all bulletins on the channel; Hewson again composed the music. In March 1999, the \\"ITV News\\" brand was introduced and, with the loss of News at Ten, the \\"bongs\\" were extended to all ITN bulletins (despite all but one of them starting on the half-hour). The ITN name was dropped from the start of bulletins and, in 2001, from reporter sign-offs. \\"The Awakening\\" was re-arranged again in February 2004 as part of a major revamp of ITV News, and again in January 2006 with a further revamp of ITV News bulletins. Despite the 2008 return of News at Ten, the other bulletins continued to use the \\"bongs\\". In February 2009, ITV News bulletins were refreshed to be more cohesive with the branding and look of News at Ten, with the studio featuring a VR view of London and an outline of the Big Ben clockface filling the \\"theatre of news\\" screen. On 22 October 2009, it was announced that the \\"Big Ben\\" branding would be removed from ITV News from 2 November to avoid perceptions of London-centricity, thus marking the first time that the clock tower has not been used in programme titles for ITN bulletins on ITV since before 1967. However, \\"Big Ben\\" hadn't gone entirely ‚Äì a clockface was retained as part of ITV News' studio design from 2009 to 2013; and the clock tower was seen again in the ITV News opening sequences from 2013. Election coverage ITN has, like the BBC, run special through-the-night coverage on the day of general elections in Britain and on the day of presidential elections in the United States since its formation in 1955. Election 64 ‚Äì The Result was hosted by Alastair Burnet, the fast-rising face of politics on ITV, and contained many visual gimmicks to keep the audience interested in the coverage. The BBC started the trend with its \\"swingometer\\" device. ITN's 1964 coverage presented a contraption referred to by Burnet as \\"KDF9\\" which aimed to pull in the results faster than its competitor over at the BBC. ITN's Election 66, again hosted by Burnet and providing nine-hour coverage of the results of the election between Harold Wilson and Ted Heath, used two computer machines that Burnet described as bringing in numerous pieces of data and statistical information ‚Äì Burnet also quipped, \\"I'll let you into a secret ‚Äì it can sing as well\\". The 1974 general election results were presented under the title The Nation Decides by Peter Snow. Technology had also vastly improved. \\"VTF30\\", a piece of technology based upon a knitting-pattern machine, provided moving computer graphics for the first time in television election coverage history. The team of Alastair Burnet and Peter Sissons provided many memorable election night programmes on ITV, including the 1984 European elections and Election 87, but by 1992 the faces of ITV's political coverage had changed somewhat. Election 92 was anchored by Jon Snow, with Alastair Stewart providing graphical commentary and Julia Somerville assisting with regular news summaries. Stewart and Somerville were again present for ITV's 1997 coverage of the John Major-Tony Blair election ‚Äì aptly titled Election 97 ‚Äì with Jonathan Dimbleby as the anchor. Dimbleby returned for Election 2001 and Election 2005, aided both times by ITV News' political editors John Sergeant (in 2001) and Nick Robinson (in 2005) and a team of correspondents and newscasters around the country at polling stations. The US presidential election of November 2008 was covered by ITN on the ITV network between 23:15 and 06:00 in a programme titled Election Night Live: America Decides, which saw ITN team up with fellow news organisation NBC News; Alastair Stewart hosted from the studio in London, supported by MORI- founder Bob Worcester and a team of studio guests throughout the evening. Julie Etchingham, James Mates, Bill Neely and John Irvine provided the all- important presenting and reporting duties from the United States. Stewart also presented ITN coverage of the European elections of 2009, an intimate affair with the newscaster and ITV News election analyst Colin Rallings in the studio. Political Editor Tom Bradby and Senior Political Correspondent Chris Ship provided regular updates, and a team of dedicated reporters gave results as they were counted around the country. The UK general election campaign of 2010 was covered by ITV under the banner Campaign 2010, prominent in all its news and current affairs programming. There were special election-themed editions of the Tonight programme presented by ITN reporters and newscasters. Alastair Stewart was the moderator for The First Election Debate, the first ever debate between leaders of political parties in the United Kingdom, transmitted on 15 April between 20:30 and 22:00. A weekly discussion programme also began on that date: Campaign 2010 with Jonathan Dimbleby. The weeks of special programming culminated in the 6 May election night coverage on ITV: Election 2010, which was broadcast between 21:55 and 06:00 and presented by Alastair Stewart. Julie Etchingham fronted the traditional ITV election night graphics, Mary Nightingale hosted the ITV election party on the bank of the Thames, and ITV News Election Analyst Colin Rallings provided the all important psephological information. GMTV dedicated its entire 7 May programme to the Election, with contributions from ITV newscasters Etchingham, Nightingale and James Mates. Mark Austin and Katie Derham continued the ITN coverage following GMTV: Election 2010 returned between 09:25 and 10:50. Alastair Stewart then returned with the programme at 12:30 until 15:00. ITV Wales, STV and UTV provided additional programming relevant to their coverage areas. The 2015 UK general election was held on Thursday 7 May 2015. Tom Bradby and Julie Etchingham anchored ITV's coverage of the results from the main ITV News studio at ITN from 21:55 on Thursday 7 May and continued through the night until 06:00 on Friday 8 May 2015. They were joined in the studio by election analysts Professor Colin Rallings and Professor Jane Green. Nina Hossain presented live from the \\"Opinion Room\\" at ITN where journalists, bloggers, politicians and experts gave their view on the results of the election. From the \\"Opinion Room\\", viewers could contact the programme via Facebook and Twitter to give their views and opinions. UTV in Northern Ireland and STV in Scotland provided their own overnight coverage of the election results in their region from their main studios in Belfast and Glasgow, dipping in and out of the ITV news coverage during the night. The rest of the UK had regular regional news opt outs from their own local ITV News programmes during the overnight coverage on ITV. At 06:00 on Friday 8 May 2015, ITV's breakfast programme Good Morning Britain aired their first election coverage special on ITV, Good Morning Britain having only launched in the spring of 2014. Hosts Susanna Reid and Ben Shephard were joined by Tom Bradby for breakfast coverage of the results. At 09:25 ITV News resumed with their own coverage of the results with Alastair Stewart and Julie Etchingham at their anchor desks until late afternoon on ITV. During the course of the day there were regular regional news opt outs, with UTV and STV providing more extensive coverage of the election results in their own region. The then Prime Minister Theresa May called a snap general election for Thursday 8 June 2017. ITV News once again had Tom Bradby at the helm from 9:55pm on ITV, using the same set design from the 2015 general election. He was joined by Professors Jane Green and Colin Rallings, along with Robert Peston and Nina Hossain. Bradby was joined through the night by former chancellor George Osborne and former shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Coverage handed over to Good Morning Britain with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid from 6:00am, with the ITV News coverage resuming at 9:25am, and airing through the rest of the day on ITV with Julie Etchingham anchoring the coverage through Friday.https://www.transdiffusion.org/2017/05/31/election- schedulehttps://www.tvnewsroom.org/itv-news/itv-election-results- programme-2017-presentation-173413/ The 2019 general election happened on Thursday 12 December 2019. ITV News once again had Tom Bradby as the main anchor in the studio, using once again a similar set design used in 2015 and 2017, however some updates to the background were made. ITV News also used the large space of the atrium at ITN headquarters in London, using it as the election results headquarters, with Robert Peston-based there. Coverage started at 9:55pm and aired through the night, handing over once again to Good Morning Britain at 6.00m, and resuming coverage from 9:25am with Julie Etchingham anchoring the coverage through Friday.https://www.tvnewsroom.org/itv-news/general-election-2019-itv- presentation-221432/https://www.transdiffusion.org/2019/12/09/election- viewing-and-listening Broadcasts National and international news *ITV Lunchtime News *ITV Evening News *ITV News at Ten *ITV Weekend News Nations and regions news The 2013 rebrand of ITV News saw the brand being extended to regional news programmes operated by ITV plc replacing the previous regional news titles. Regional ITV news programmes are produced by ITV plc, with the exception of the ITV London region which is produced by ITN. Since the creation of ITV plc in 2004 all regional news programmes in these regions have taken on a unified look and appearance on screen while structurally the merger has enabled ITV to create the ITV News Group consisting of ITN's national news service and the regional services provided by ITV plc.

Awards ITN has won many key industry awards for its news coverage on ITV during the past fifty years. Legendary editor Geoffrey Cox was the recipient of ITN's very first award ‚Äì a BAFTA in 1962. Since then BAFTA has gone on to present ITN with a total of 26 awards, for coverage on ITV ranging from Francis Chichester's home-coming in 1967 to the Northern Ireland troubles, the Iranian Embassy siege, wars in the Falklands, Lebanon and the Gulf, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster, the discovery of the Serb camps, the genocide in Rwanda, the storming of the Moscow White House, and the conflict in former Yugoslavia. ITN/ITV News picked up both Royal Television Society (RTS) and Broadcast awards for coverage of the Beslan school siege, and Alastair Stewart won the RTS News Presenter of the Year award in 2005. The 18:30 ITV Evening News held the title of RTS News Programme of the Year for four years running, starting in 2004. News at Ten was nominated for the award in the RTS Journalism Awards 2007/2008, but lost out to the BBC News at 10. However, in the BAFTA Television Awards ceremony held on Sunday 26 April 2009, News at Ten won in the category News Coverage for their coverage of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. It was up against its ITN rival Channel 4 News and Sky News, who had two nominations. News at Ten's coverage of the earthquake also won the International Emmy award for News Coverage in September 2009. In June 2010, the programme won the News Coverage BAFTA for the second year running, for their coverage of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. There have been over 70 RTS awards for both domestic and international coverage, with the first coming for the 1969 Apollo moon landing. Home based issues including the miners' strike, the Iranian embassy siege, the Tottenham riots, the Kings Cross fire, the death of Labour leader John Smith and coverage of Dunblane have all been voted the Best Journalism of the Year by the RTS. RTS awards for foreign coverage range from conflicts in Vietnam, Eritrea, Poland, El Salvador, Beirut, Afghanistan, Iraq, South Africa, Russia, Chechnya, Bosnia, Israel and Albania as well as humanitarian disasters including Romania, the Mozambique floods and the Asian tsunami. Coverage of the aforementioned Mozambique floods in 2000 also won an Emmy award. From the United States there has been recognition of ITN's journalism, from the prestigious Emmy awards, the New York Television Programming Festival and the White House News Photographers' Association. ITN was the first non-US news broadcaster to win a News and Documentary Emmy when it was awarded top prize for Outstanding Investigative Journalism for the 1992 discovery of the Serb camps. The famous footage of emaciated men behind barbed wire went round the world and helped change the course of the conflict in Bosnia. In addition to many BAFTA, Emmy and RTS awards, ITN/ITV News has also claimed awards from the Monte Carlo Gold Nymphs, prizes from the News Festival of Angers in France, the Television and Radio Industries Club, the Ethnic Multicultural Media Awards and the Broadcasting Press Guild as well as many others.

The Sevilla was bought by John McEntee Bowman and Charles Francis Flynn in 1919 and renamed the Hotel Sevilla-Biltmore. In 1924, Bowman-Biltmore Hotels constructed a huge ten-story tower wing, with a rooftop ballroom, designed by noted New York architects Schultze & Weaver. In 1939, the Sevilla-Biltmore was purchased by Italian-Uruguayan mobster Amleto Battisti y Lora. Its casino was closely associated with Havana's mafia network, being part-owned by Santo Trafficante, Jr. Mobs destroyed the Sevilla-Biltmore's casino on January 1, 1959, after Fulgencio Batista fled the country overnight as Fidel Castro's rebel army approached Havana. Amleto Battisti took refuge in the Uruguayan embassy.Batista and Regime Flee Cuba; Castro Moving to Take Power; Mobs Riot and Loot in Havana, The New York Times, January 2, 1959 The Sevilla-Biltmore was featured in Graham Greene's novel Our Man in Havana as the location where the protagonist joins the British secret service. Today, the hotel is owned by the Cuban state-run Gran Caribe hotel group. The French Accor chain assumed management of it in 1996, first under their Sofitel division as the Hotel Sofitel Sevilla Havana, and more recently under their Mercure Hotels division as the Hotel Mercure Sevilla Havane. Accor announced plans in 2017 to renovate the Sevilla and transfer it to their boutique MGallery by Sofitel division. However they then ceased management of the hotel in January 2019.

The name originates from a series of lake terraces formed as the water level in Lake Superior lowered following the latest ice age. History Terrace Bay originated as a company town in the 1940s when a pulp and paper mill was established there by the Longlac Pulp & Paper Company, later renamed Kimberly-Clark Forest Products. At the same time, the Aguasabon Generating Station was created by the Ontario Hydro water division, to redirect the northward flowing Long Lake south through the Aguasabon River system to Lake Superior. On September 1, 1947, Terrace Bay was granted status as an Improvement District. The pulp mill was the lead developer with construction of the community's basic infrastructure. By the end of 1948, Terrace Bay consisted of about 230 houses serviced with sewer, water and electricity but surrounded only by bush as the highway was still not completed through the town. In 1951, the Lakeview subdivision was started, with sewer, water and electrical services provided for well over 100 houses. By December 31, 33 of the 35 new houses were completed and occupied. Other additions to the community were two new churches, 22-bed modern hospital, post office, bank, liquor store, theatre, clothing store and railway station. Construction of the Memorial Recreation Centre was completed in July 1953. The building consisted of an arena, curling club, restaurant, bowling alley, library, offices, three meeting rooms and public washrooms. In 1958, the mill converted to chlorine dioxide bleaching and had sold 63 houses to employees and another 28 houses were privately built. The next year, Terrace Bay became a municipal township. In 1972, the Kimberly Clark Pulp and Paper Company Ltd. and Kimberly Clark of Canada Ltd. amalgamated. From 1972 to 1977 the population of Terrace Bay increased from 1,755 to 2,299 persons, directly attributed to Kimberly Clark's expansion program. The pulp mill was the lifeblood of the region and in 2005 Kimberly-Clark sold the mill to Neenah Paper Inc, who then sold the mill to Buchanan Forestry Products in 2006. The mill was renamed to Terrace Bay Pulp Inc. It operated until it ran into financial hardship and was shut down in 2009. After financial reorganization, it reopened in October 2010 to strong pulp markets. However, soon thereafter the mill ran into financial trouble again and had to declare bankruptcy and look for a buyer. In July 2012, the Aditya Birla Group agreed to purchase the mill. The municipality carried out a plan for growth in 2010/2011 including the downtown revitalization plan, the cultural centre project, and a rebranding of the township based on Lake Superior and the new Terrace Bay Lighthouse attraction that was built. The community continues to look at new ways to encourage job growth and support the business community. Amenities Terrace Bay's McCausland Hospital is a modern, fully accredited 45-bed community hospital. It serves a population of approximately 4,000 residents from the communities of Terrace Bay, Schreiber, Rossport, Jackfish and Pays Plat. Named for the town's first physician, Michael McCausland, the present structure was built in 1980 and is situated overlooking the shores of Lake Superior. The McCausland Hospital expanded in May 2011 with the creation of the Wilkes Terrace 22-bed long-term care facility. The Aguasabon Medical Clinic is located in the McCausland Hospital and has a full complement of physicians with same-day medical service. Upon moving to Terrace Bay and visiting the clinic, new residents are immediately assigned their own family physician. The town has three elementary schools: Terrace Bay Public School, St. Martin's Catholic School, and √âcole Catholique Franco-Terrace. Lake Superior High School accommodates students from surrounding communities. The town's Recreation Centre holds a hockey arena, outdoor pool, curling rink, fitness centre, bowling alley, and various athletic courts. During the summer months, the Aquasabon Golf Course opens and during the winter months, the Trestle Ridge Ski Hill. The Voyageur Hiking Trail passes through the community. The Terrace Bay Cultural Centre was built in October 2010 which includes the expanded Terrace Bay Public Library, the Terrace Bay Seniors' Activity Centre, and the Michael King Community Hall. The large majority of businesses, including a grocery store, pharmacy, post office, Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO), flower shop, gift shops, outdoor supply store, stationery and print shop, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) bank and various restaurants are located on the main street, Simcoe Plaza, which saw a major revitalization effort in 2011. Simcoe Plaza had renovations, landscaping, streetscaping, and the construction of a lighthouse attraction for visitors to climb and take in views of Lake Superior, the nearby Slate Islands, and the rest of the municipality. Terrace Bay boasts a multitude of sandy beaches on the shores of Lake Superior as well as smaller inland lakes. Accessible by vehicle and hiking trails, the Lake Superior beaches boast waves in late summer that bring a variety of water sport lovers to the town, including surfers and body boarders. The inland lakes provide warm sheltered swimming for the many hikers and campers who come to the area. Climate Terrace Bay has a humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb), bordering on a subarctic climate (Koppen: Dfc) with September having an average of only 1.8 F (1 C) more than the 50 degree isotherm used to determine subarctic climates. Summers are very mild due to the moderation of nearby Lake Superior, with the warmest month, August, only having an average high of 68.4 degrees Fahrenheit (20.2 c). Winters are long, cold, and snowy, averaging 83 inches (211 cm) of snow per year. Terrace Bay shows signs of seasonal lag, with August being warmer on average than July, likely due to the towns proximity to Lake Superior, which causes towns on the lake influenced by the lake, to take longer to warm up than towns not on or near the lake. Demographics Slate Islands The Slate Islands, now a provincial park, are located in Lake Superior within Terrace Bay's municipal limits. The island features the highest lighthouse on Lake Superior, the largest known shatter cone in the world, abandoned gold mines, and wildlife including the largest unthreatened boreal woodland caribou population in Canada. Visitors can book charters to the Slate Islands by local tourist outfitters. Dragfest In 1999, local car enthusiasts' group Superior Classics Car Club began the annual three-day drag racing event known as Terrace Bay's Dragfest. In 1999 it had 187 competitors participating, which grew to over 300 in 2010, with spectators now numbering over 10,000. Most drivers originate from the Thunder Bay area, but the event has also attracted participants from Southern Ontario, Winnipeg, and Minnesota. Over its twenty-year history, the race has been financially successful, allowing continued investment into permanent and improved facilities for competitors and spectators. Money has also been used to support local service clubs and charities, with total donations exceeding $150,000. Major recipients include the Camp Quality, Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre, Terrace Bay McCausland Hospital, local fire departments, ambulances, food bank, and animal shelters.

This is also known as the medial compartment of the thigh that consists of the adductor muscles of the hip or the groin muscles. A pulled groin muscle usually refers to a painful injury sustained by straining the hip adductor muscles. Pulled groin muscleThese hip adductor muscles that make up the groin consist of the adductor brevis, adductor longus, adductor magnus, gracilis, and pectineus. These groin muscles adduct the thigh (bring the femur and knee closer to the midline). The groin is innervated by the obturator nerve, with two exceptions: the pectineus muscle is innervated by the femoral nerve, and the hamstring portion of adductor magnus is innervated by the tibial nerve. In the groin, underneath the skin, there are three to five deep inguinal lymph nodes that play a role in the immune system. These can be swollen due to certain diseases, the most common one being a simple infection, and, less likely, from cancer. A chain of superficial inguinal lymph nodes drain to the deep nodes. The inguinal ligament runs from the pubic tubercle to the anterior superior iliac spine and its anatomy is very important for hernia operations. Clinical significance Like other flexion surfaces of large joints (popliteal fossa, armpit, cubital fossa and essentially the anterior part of the neck), it is an area where blood vessels and nerves pass relatively superficially, and with an increased amount of lymph nodes.

Upon its grand opening in 1923, the Los Angeles Biltmore was the largest hotel west of Chicago in the United States.Jones, Finn-Olaf (April 24, 2006). \\"It's De Limit, It's Deluxe, It's De-Lovely\\" . Forbes. Retrieved 8-27-2009. In 1969 the Biltmore Hotel was designated a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument by the City of Los Angeles. Regal Hotels purchased the Biltmore in 1996, and then sold it in 1999 to Millennium & Copthorne Hotels.Sanchez, Jesus (November 19, 1999). \\"Regal Biltmore Hotel to Change Ownership\\". Los Angeles Times. retrieved 3-24-2015. As of 2009, the Los Angeles Biltmore is operated as part of the Millennium & Copthorne Hotels chain as the Millennium Biltmore Hotel. The hotel has of meeting and banquet space. From its original 1500 guestrooms it now has 683, due to room reorganization. Architecture Millennium Biltmore Hotel Lobby The architectural firm Schultze & Weaver designed the Biltmore's exterior in a synthesis of the Spanish-Italian Renaissance Revival, Mediterranean Revival, and Beaux Arts styles, meant as an homage to the Castilian heritage of Los Angeles. The \\"Biltmore Angel\\" is heavily incorporated into the design‚Äîas a symbol of the city as well as the Biltmore itself. With a thick steel and concrete frame, the structure takes up half a city block and rises over 11 stories. The interiors of the Biltmore Hotel are decorated with: frescos and murals; carved marble fountains and columns; massive wood-beamed ceilings; travertine and oak paneled walls; lead crystal chandeliers; cast bronze stairwells and doorways; fine artisan marquetry and mill work; and heavily embroidered imported tapestries and draperies. Most notable are the frescoed mural ceilings in the main Galleria and the Crystal Ballroom, which were hand painted in 1922 by Italian artist John B. Smeraldi, known for his work in the Vatican and the White House. Smeraldi and his team famously painted the ballroom's colorful, seamless fresco over a period of seven months, decorating it with figures of Greek and Roman gods, angels, cupids and other mythological creatures. It was meticulously restored in the 1980s by Smeraldi's apprentice, Anthony Heinsbergen. The imported Austrian crystal chandeliers that adorn it are in diameter. The Rendezvous Court, once the hotel's lobby but now used primarily for afternoon tea, is decorated with a Moorish Revival styled plaster ceiling painted with 24 Carat Gold accents, two original imported Italian chandeliers from 1923, and a grand Spanish Baroque Revival bronze doorway, whose astrological clock still keeps time today. Two figures appear on the stairwell front‚Äîon the left is the Roman goddess of agriculture Ceres, while on the right is the Spanish explorer Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa. The current lobby at the hotel's Grand Avenue entrance still has its original travertine walls and oak paneling as well as the large artificial skylighted ceiling, reflected in the custom carpet below. Millennium Biltmore Hotel Galleria Each ballroom on the Galleria level is themed either after the room's original function or the hotel's overall California-heritage premise. The Emerald Room was once the hotel's main guest dining room; its decor features images of hunt and harvest, with hand-painted animals and fish on the cast-plaster ceiling beams. The Tiffany Room was formerly an open corridor used as a drop-off point for Crystal Ballroom functions. Now enclosed, the elegant space centers around exploration, with relief sculptures and panels depicting Queen Isabella I of Castile, and Christopher Columbus and other Spanish New World explorers. The split-level Gold Room, once a dining room for elite guests, features Prohibition-era hidden liquor compartments and panels along the ceiling for press photographers to take pictures of the event below. It is decorated with a gold cast-plaster ceiling, hand-oiled wood paneling, and nine mirrored windows along three sides. The South Galleria is painted with floral friezes inspired by the decor of ancient Roman Pompeii, and features a vaulted ceiling, marble balustrades and heavy Roman piers. Gold-painted wrought iron gates open to a staircase leading down to the Biltmore Bowl. Also of interest is the hotel's health club and indoor pool, which was modeled after the decks of 1920s luxury ocean liners. Solid brass trim on windows, doors and railings, teakwood deck chairs and hand-laid Italian mosaic tile on the walls and in the pool are original. Restaurants Since 2015, four restaurants and bars serve the hotel, including Smeraldi's Restaurant (American continental cuisine), newly relaunched Bugis Street Brasserie, the Rendezvous Court, and the Gallery Bar. Events The Los Angeles Biltmore is known for being an early home to the Academy Awards ceremony‚Äîthe Oscars. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was founded at a luncheon banquet in the Crystal Ballroom in May 1927, when guests such as Louis B. Mayer met to discuss plans for the new organization and presenting achievement awards to colleagues in their industry. Legend has it that MGM art director Cedric Gibbons, who was in attendance, immediately grabbed a linen Biltmore napkin and sketched the design for the Oscar statue on it. Eight Oscar ceremonies were held in the Biltmore Bowl during the Academy's early years of 1931, 1935‚Äì39, and 1941-42. In 1977, Bob Hope hosted the Academy's 50th Anniversary banquet in the same room. The Biltmore Theater was situated at the corner of 5th and Grand, now the Biltmore Court & Tower location. Will Rogers emceed the opening of the theater in 1924, which then hosted plays starring luminaries such as Helen Hayes, Katharine Hepburn, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, Bela Lugosi and Mae West until it closed in 1967. It also occasionally booked high-profile films such as the 1925 silent epic Ben Hur: A Tale of the Christ which ran for 14 weeks in 1926 and silent Academy Award winner Wings, which stayed over 20 weeks in 1928. In 1929, Germany's Graf Zeppelin airship soared over the hotel on its round-the-world voyage, sponsored by newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst. Crew and passengers were fed by Biltmore culinary staff, who also replenished their on-board supplies. During World War II, the Biltmore served as a military rest and recreation facility, with the entire second floor equipped with cots for military personnel on leave. On March 7, 1952, the well-known yogi and author Paramahansa Yogananda, collapsed and died of a heart attack after finishing a speech in honor of the Indian ambassador Binay Ranjan Sen. This site within the hotel is now revered by many as the place of the yogi's mahasamadhi, or conscious leave of the body. The 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles chose John F. Kennedy as the party's presidential nominee. He set up his campaign headquarters in the Music Room (now the Lobby), with running mate Lyndon B. Johnson across the hall in the Emerald Room. Their press conferences in the Crystal Ballroom were heavily photographed and documented. The Beatles paid a visit to the Presidential Suite in August 1964 during their first U.S. tour. Due to the overwhelming number of fans crowding the sidewalks in front of the hotel, the \\"Fab Four\\" were forced to access their room by landing atop the hotel in a helicopter. The Los Angeles Biltmore Hotel served the International Olympic Committee as their headquarters during the 1984 Summer Olympics. In 1988, the Duke & Duchess of York were hosted by Armand Hammer at a Biltmore gala. Recently the Biltmore has hosted the semi-finals for American Idol, the yearly awards for the Cinemal Audio Society, visiting teams for the World Baseball Classic, and multiple Grammy Awards after-parties.

P&O; Cruises was spun off from P&O; in 2000, and is now owned and operated by Carnival Corporation & plc. The former shipping business, P&O; Nedlloyd, was bought by and is now part of Maersk Line. History =Early years and expansion: 1822‚Äì1900= Thomas Gabriel's reception of H.I.M. The Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz Khan at The Guildhall, 18 July 1867, issued to The Chairman of the P. & O. Steam Navigation Company. In 1822, Brodie McGhie Willcox, a London ship broker, and Arthur Anderson, a sailor from the Shetland Isles, went into partnership to operate a shipping line, primarily operating routes between England and Spain and Portugal. In 1835, Dublin shipowner Captain Richard Bourne joined the business, and the three men chartered the William Fawcett and started a regular steamer service between London and Spain and Portugal - the Iberian Peninsula - using the name Peninsular Steam Navigation Company, with services to Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon and C√°diz. The company flag colours are directly connected with the Peninsular flags: the white and blue represent the Portuguese flag in 1837, and the yellow and red the Spanish flag. At the height of the Carlist Wars the British lent their support to the legitimate heirs of Spain and Portugal and all three of P&O; founders played their part, from gun running to chartering steamers. As a consequence of this association and involvement P&O; officers are the only Merchant Navy officers entitled to wear swords. William Fane De Salis (1812‚Äì1896), joined P & O in 1849.

In 1837, the business won a contract from the British Admiralty to deliver mail to the Iberian Peninsula and in 1840 they acquired a contract to deliver mail to Alexandria in Egypt. In the 1870s, they added Brindisi to their route P&O; first introduced passenger services in 1844, with a leisure cruise departing from Southampton to the Mediterranean. These voyages were the first of their kind and the forerunner of modern cruise holidays. The company later introduced round trips to destinations such as Alexandria and Constantinople and underwent rapid expansion in the later half of the 19th century, with its ships becoming larger and more luxurious. One particularly notable ship of the era was the SS Ravenna, built in 1880, which became the first ship to be built with a total steel superstructure. In 1847, shortly after the Opium War, P&O; entered the opium trade; shipping 642,000 chests of Bengal and Malwa opium in the next eleven years. They faced stiff competition from the incumbent shippers, Jardines and the Apcar Line. As the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company was incorporated in 1840 by a Royal Charter its name therefore included neither \\"Plc\\" nor \\"Limited\\". =Early 20th century years: 1900‚Äì1945= Mail contracts were the basis of P&O;'s prosperity until the Second World War, but the company also continued to become a major commercial shipping line and passenger liner operator. In 1914, it took over the British India Steam Navigation Company, which was then the largest British shipping line, owning 131 steamers. In 1918, it gained a controlling interest in the Orient Line, its partner in the England-Australia mail route. Further acquisitions followed and the fleet reached a peak of almost 500 ships in the mid-1920s. In 1920, the company also established a bank, P&O; Bank, that it sold to Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China (now Standard Chartered Bank) in 1927. At this time it established a commercial relationship with Spinney's of Haifa, that developed into a major regional high-end grocery store chain, which eventually provided shipping services access to much of the Middle East. Until 1934 it operated liners from Key West, Florida to Havana; then it operated from Miami to Cuba until 1960. In 1932, P&O; expanded their passenger operations to Australia, with the introduction of Strathaird, which departed on a cruise to Brisbane and Norfolk Island. Eighty-five of the company's ships were sunk in the First World War and 179 in the Second World War. =Post war: 1945‚Äì2000= After 1945, the passenger market declined to India, but boomed to Australia with the advent of paid-passages for literate and healthy European immigrants known as Ten Pound Poms. P&O; built 15 large passenger liners, including , , , and , culminating in and , which were an unprecedented speed and size. By 1968, over 1 million immigrants had arrived‚Äîmany via P&O;‚Äîand Australia ended the programme. P&O; entered the cruise market and began to sell and scrap many of these liners. It concentrated mainly on cargo ships. It entered the tanker trade in 1959 and the roll-on roll-off (RORO) ferry business in the mid-1960s. P&O; and Orient Line were formally merged in 1960 to form P&O-Orient; Lines. In 1964, and were transferred to the P&O; fleet. The name Orient Line was dropped altogether in 1966 when and were also transferred to the P&O; fleet. In 1969, British and Commonwealth Shipping, Furness Withy, P&O; and The Ocean Steamship Company established Overseas Containers Limited (OCL) to exploit containerisation. By the early 1980s, it had converted all of its dry cargo liner routes to container operations and in 1986 it bought out the remaining OCL partners, renaming the operation P&O; Containers Limited (P&OCL;). P&OCL; was merged with Nedlloyd in 1996 to form P&O; Nedlloyd. In the 1970s, with the advent of cheap air travel and with ocean liners becoming increasingly expensive to run, P&O; refocused its passenger operations on cruise ships. This culminated in the foundation of the subsidiary company P&O; Cruises in 1977, under which P&O; carried out its subsequent passenger operations. Treasure presented to the directors of the P & O by the Viceroy of Egypt, c.1860/70 In 1972, P&O; formally absorbed the British-India Steam Navigation Company (BI). The amalgamation of these two companies began in 1914 but BI had retained its own identity until this time. Strick Line and Hain-Nourse, amongst several other lines were also taken over in the early 1970s. BI cargo ships were renamed Strath*M* (Strathmore, Strathmuir, Strathmay, etc.) or Strath*C* (Strathcarron, Strathcarrol), the Strick line ships renamed Strath*A* (Strathanna, Strathaird, Strathattrick (the big \\"A\\") etc.) and the Hain-Nourse ships Strath*T* (Strathtruim, Strathtay etc.). The newest ships were 6 Strath*D*s (Strathdoon, Strathduns etc.), SD14s built in Sunderland. P&O; also built 6 ships in Stocznia Gdansk, Poland (the Strath*E*s) and 2 ships in Japan (the Strath*F*s) and bought into DOT, a naval shipping company. Report & Accounts cover, dated 9 December 1931. In 1975, P&O; established Pandoro for operation of the company's Irish Sea RO-RO routes. Pandoro was an acronym for P and O Ro. In 1998 P&O; European Ferries (Irish Sea) Ltd was formed by the internal merger of Pandoro Ltd. and P&O; European (Felixstowe) Ltd., to run the Irish Sea routes. In 1987, P&O; took over the European Ferries Group Plc-- to which it had previously sold its cross channel ferry services in 1985-- which traded as Townsend Thoresen, and renamed the company P&O; European Ferries. Over the last quarter of the Twentieth Century P&O; diversified into construction management (through the Bovis companies, which it owned from 1974 to 1999), property investment and development, and a variety of service businesses including exhibition and conference centres, but most of these activities were disposed of following the company's decision in March 1999 to concentrate on maritime and transport. Its P&O; Ports and P&O; Cold Logistics divisions developed from P&O;'s operations in Australia, where it has a leading position in these fields. Fastcraft is the name given to the service implemented after the split-up of P&O; European Ferries in 1998. The first ship was called Superstar Express (entered service in 1998) and sailed alongside Pride of Cherbourg and Pride of Hampshire between Plymouth and Cherbourg.

The operator of the ship, Townsend Thoresen, had been purchased by P&O; in 1986. The incident resulted in a coroner's inquest and a public inquiry. A jury at the coroner's inquest found a prima facie case that the company was guilty of manslaughter, and the Crown Prosecution Service charged the company and seven employees (see corporate manslaughter). The charges did not result in any convictions.

Takeover controversy: 2006  When the merger was approved by the US government in February 2006, the Bush Administration came under fire from critics who questioned the decision to allow an Arab-owned company to oversee US ports. The move placed the leasehold interests of P&O; in New York City, Newark, Baltimore, Miami, New Orleans, and Philadelphia under the control of Dubai Ports World. US operations represent ten percent of P&O;'s worldwide operations, and consist primarily of cranes and terminals. Many US politicians and media commentators assumed implicitly that the merger would affect port security at ports that P&O; either managed or handled the loading and unloading of ships. David Osler, Industrial Shipping Editor of Lloyd's List said that US security procedures and overall port control would not be affected by the transaction.Concern over Control of U.S. Ports - NPR - February 20, 2006 Several US states sought ways to block the move, citing security concerns as well as the possibility of losing related leases of foreign ports.ABC President Bush stated he would veto any legislation created with the intent to interfere with the change.Bush Defends Deal to Entrust Ports to Dubai Firm - NPR - February 21, 2006  Sale of assets: 2006  On 9 March 2006, DP World agreed to sell its terminal operations at the American ports to an American company.

London Midland and Scottish Railway's number 5552 (British Railways' number 45552), named Silver Jubilee was Jubilee Class 4-6-0 express steam locomotive. It was specially named for the silver jubilee of George V.  Overview  The original 5552 was the first of the class that emerged in June 1934 from Crewe Works (Maker's number: 63 Lot Number: 97). The original 5552 however swapped identities with classmate 5642 in April 1935 (built December 1934 Crewe, Makers Number: 203 Lot Number: 112, later named Boscawen). 5552 was given a special livery of all over black (it originally had been, like the rest of the class, painted crimson lake) with silver lining and specially cast chrome numbers and named Silver Jubilee to mark the silver jubilee of George V. This scheme was retained until the 1948 nationalization by British Railways. The rest of its class were thereafter officially known as the Jubilee Class. It originally had a low degree superheat domeless boiler but received a high degree superheat domed boiler in 1940. The loco was allocated to several LMS depots during its service, including Longsight, Manchester, in 1947/48, from where it ran on express trains to London Euston and other destinations. It was renumbered 45552 in 1951, receiving new cast numbers. It was also given a livery of Brunswick green during the 1950s. 45552 was withdrawn in September 1964, and scrapped at Cashmores, Great Bridge.  Preservation  Although 5552 was not preserved, it has been represented in preservation. In 1994 classmate 5593 Kolhapur was disguised as 5552 in original livery to mark the silver jubilee of the preserved Great Central Railway. In 2003, another preserved Jubilee, 5690 Leander was temporarily renamed Golden Jubilee for the Golden Jubilee of George V's granddaughter HM Queen Elizabeth II, though retaining the crimson lake livery.

She is Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and Centennial visiting Professor at the London School of Economics. Sassen coined the term global city. Family and early life Sassen was born in The Hague, Netherlands in 1947. In 1948 Sassen's parents, Willem Sassen and Miep van der Voort, moved to Argentina and the family lived in Buenos Aires. Her father was a Dutch collaborator with the Nazis, a Nazi journalist, and a member of the Waffen-SS. In the 1950s Willem Sassen was close to Adolf Eichmann when both were living in Argentina, and she recalls him visiting her childhood home.http://chronicle.com/article/Saskia-Sassens-Missing/150337/ Saskia Sassen also spent part of her youth in Italy and says she was \\"brought up in five languages.\\" She is married to sociologist Richard Sennett. Artist Hilary Koob- Sassen is her son from her first marriage. Education From 1966, Sassen spent a year each at the Universit√© de Poitiers, France, the Universit√† degli Studi di Roma, and the University of Buenos Aires, for studies in philosophy and political science. From 1969, Sassen studied sociology and economics at the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, where she obtained a M.A. in 1971 and a Ph.D. degree in 1974, under the direction of Fabio Dasilva. She also received a master's degree in philosophy from the University of Poitiers in 1974. Academic posts After being a post-doctoral fellow at the Center for International Affairs at Harvard University, Sassen held various academic positions in and outside the US, such as the Ralph Lewis Professor of Sociology at the University of Chicago. She is currently Robert S. Lynd Professor of Sociology at Columbia University and Centennial Visiting Professor of Political Economy in the Department of Sociology at the London School of Economics. During the 1980s and 1990s, Sassen emerged as a prolific author in urban sociology. She studied the impacts of globalisation such as economic restructuring, and how the movements of labour and capital influence urban life. She also studied the influence of communication technology on governance. Sassen observed how nation states begin to lose power to control these developments, and she studied increasing general transnationalism, including transnational human migration. She identified and described the phenomenon of the global city. Her 1991 book bearing this title made her a widely quoted author on globalisation. An updated edition of her book was published in 2001. In the early 2000s, Sassen focused on immigration and globalization, with her \\"denationalization\\" and \\"transnationalism\\" projects (see Bibliography and External Links, below).

The islands were created by a meteorite impact which formed a crater about wide.Sharpton, Dressler, (1996), p. 1177 In 1985, the Ontario government established the Slate Islands as a natural environment provincial park. The islands are notable for having Ontario's largest herd of boreal woodland caribou. The total surface area is about . The nearby Leadman Group of islands east is often considered part of the Slate Islands. Fauna The islands are home to woodland caribou which have been studied extensively from 1974 to 2007 by Dr. A.T. (Tom) Bergerud. The caribou are a classic example of island biogeography in action; the islands are notable for species that are absent but present on the adjacent mainland (red squirrel, moose, white-tailed deer, and grouse). No ungulates were present on the islands until the caribou arrived in the early 1900s while predators have been present only sporadically. Caribou reached the highest population density in the world on the islands before the 1990s, with the herd estimated at 650 animals.Godwin (1996), p. 3 After a food shortage and die-off in 1990, the numbers were reduced to about 100. In 2012 there were about 200 caribou on the Slate Islands. Wolves reached the archipelago in the early 1990s preying heavily on the caribou but for reasons not entirely understood they disappeared a few years later. Wolves are again present on the island since winter 2015/16 (or earlier) as evidenced by aerial observation and scat. Other mammals found on the islands include beaver, muskrat, snowshoe hare, short-tailed weasel, red-backed vole, and red fox. The waters surrounding the Slate Islands have been protected from commercial fishing to preserve one of the last native stocks of lake trout in Lake Superior. The Islands have been a source of lake trout brood stock used at the Dorion Fish Hatchery, and fingerlings are planted back to Lake Superior to restore the fishery. Flora Saxifraga paniculata, growing at Williams Point in the Slate Islands The cooling effect of Lake Superior makes the Slate Islands a particularly harsh habitat for its latitude. As a result, islands harbour arctic and alpine plant species such as alpine chickweed (at its most southerly occurrence),Pye (1997), p. 83 Dryas drummondii (not found again for 1600 km (1000 mi) north), and alpine bistort, an Inuit delicacy eaten with seal oil. These arctic disjuncts are reminders of ice ages and associated tundra conditions in this area in the past. Human history Human sites have been found on the islands dating to about 1000CE. A lighthouse was built on Patterson Island, the largest island, in 1903 to help ships locate the harbour at the nearby town of Jackfish, Ontario. The island is named after William Patterson, a former lieutenant-governor of Saskatchewan. Later, a fishing station was built on McColl Island. The original forests on the islands were modified by logging and forest fires. Up until the 1940s, the islands were used to stockpile boomed logs from the mainland Lake Superior north shore for export on lake freighters to pulp mills in the United States. In 1985, the Slate Islands were protected as an Ontario Natural Environment Provincial Park. There are no facilities and the islands can only be accessed via boat or airplane. The islands remoteness is enforced by almost 9 km of open, wild, Lake Superior water and its distance from any large communities. It is frequented by naturalists, fishing parties, sailors exploring this Great Lake, and recently by an increasing number of sea kayaking parties. Impact crater North American Middle Ordovician impact craters, which may be part of the Ordovician meteor event. Key: 1: Ames crater, 2: Decorah crater, 3: Rock Elm Disturbance, 4: Slate Islands crater. shatter cone located in McGreevy Harbour, Slate Islands The Slate Islands mark the centre of a large meteorite impact crater. The original crater rim is estimated at about in diameter, but this and most of the crater has subsequently eroded away, leaving the islands which are interpreted as a central uplift. The age of the impact event is estimated to be about 450 million years (Ordovician). Another source estimates the age at 800-500 million years (late Proterozoic to early Paleozoic).Sharpton, Dressler, (1996), p. 1178 It may be one of several Middle Ordovician meteors that fell roughly simultaneously 469 million years ago, part of a proposed Ordovician meteor event, including the Decorah crater in Iowa, the Ames crater in Oklahoma, and the Rock Elm crater in Wisconsin. Geology The islands are not made of slate; the rock is mainly of metamorphosed volcanic rocks greater than 2.7 billion years old. Also present are sedimentary rocks of the Rove and Gunflint formations, approximately 1.85-2.10 billion years old. There is evidence that about 1.1 billion years ago, there was volcanic centre on Paterson Island, however almost all volcanic rocks have been removed by erosion.Pye (1997), p. 84 The youngest rocks are diatremes, referring to breccia-filled volcanic pipes that were formed by gaseous explosions. They occur as dikes or sills which criss-cross the all older rocks types. Also located in the islands are good examples of shatter cones, rare geological features formed in bedrock by the high velocity shock waves created by meteorite impacts. They have a distinctively conical shape with thin grooves (striae) that radiate from the top (apex) of the cone. The Slate Islands are home to a shatter cone measuring , one of the largest examples in the world (pictured here). Allogenic breccia is present, notably on the east and north sides of the islands.

Hithadhoo is the main administrative district of Addu City, with many of the administrative buildings in this district. The town is situated on the island of the same name, the westernmost of Addu Atoll (previously known as Seenu Atoll). In terms of population count, Hithadhoo is home to the largest population in Addu City. According to the 2014 Census, with 11,129 residents, Hithadhoo also has the largest population of any administrative island in Maldives, a category that excludes the much larger capital, Mal√©. Geography The island is south of the country's capital, Mal√©. Hithadhoo is the second largest island in the Maldives with a surface area of . It has a length of and a width of at its widest point. It is also the second largest island in Maldives. The part of the island south of the town is lushly vegetated with palms and shrubs, whilst the northern end of the island consists of a partially stony, unreal scrubland, which can be explored only on narrow trails. Hithadhoo Town is marked by dusty roads, narrow lanes, leaning houses and dense vegetation. Island traffic is generally quite colourful, particularly when hundreds of island school children dressed in a multitude of differently coloured school uniforms are queueing up for the bus. Population According to the 2014 census, Hithadhoo has a population of some 11,129 residents, and is the second largest settlement in Maldives. The local dialect of Dhivehi, Addu Bas, is spoken by most of the people who live here. Addu Bas is closely related to dialects spoken on nearby atolls. It is also the second most spoken dialect in the whole Maldives.

Most Hithadhoo residents complete their education up to Ordinary Level on the island itself, whilst a few options to continue their studies in Mal√© or abroad. A certain number of youngsters from neighbouring islands, mainly from Maradhoo, Maradhoo-Feydhoo, and Feydhoo attend sharafuddin School, a secondary school on Hithadhoo, to complete their O-level studies. Several students from other atolls like Fuvahmulah attend secondary schools on Hithadhoo in order to have a better education than can be had on their home islands. =Healthcare= The government has provided the residents with a hospital. This hospital has a regional function and provides around-the-clock care. Most residents of neighbouring islands visit Hithadhoo Regional Hospital to receive treatment for their ailments. People from atolls and islands further afield, such as Fuvammulah and Huvadhu Atoll also occasionally visit to receive medical treatment, although most opt for hospitals in the Southern Indian state of Kerala which provides a much wider range of facilities than available in Maldives. Apart from this, there are some private clinics like Eye Care Clinic. Eye Care is a reputed private organization in Maldives for its quality service with qualified Ophthalmologists and Optometrists and branded items. It is the largest eye-care provider in Maldives with its six outlets in different parts of the country including the one in S. Hithadhoo.

Malcolm Fraser was born in Gloucestershire, England in 1834. Nothing is known of his early life, except that he must have qualified as a surveyor at some stage, and that he emigrated to New Zealand. From 1857 to 1859, Fraser worked as a surveyor in Auckland. He was then district surveyor for the Native Land Purchase Department until 1863; district surveyor for the Canterbury West Gold Fields until 1867; and finally Chief Surveyor for Westland until 1869. In 1870, Fraser emigrated to Western Australia to take up the position of that colony's Surveyor-General, which had become vacant on the retirement of John Septimus Roe. Fraser was recruited to the position by then Governor of Western Australia Frederick Weld, who had formerly been Premier of New Zealand and knew Fraser personally from that time. Fraser commenced as surveyor-general on 19 December 1870. In May 1871 he completely reorganised the Lands and Surveys Department, which resulted in the promotion of John Forrest and the dismissal of Alexander Forrest. As surveyor-general, Fraser immediately became a nominated member of Western Australia's Legislative and Executive Councils. He remained surveyor-general until 5 January 1883, when he was appointed to succeed Edric Gifford as Colonial Secretary of Western Australia. Later that year, Fraser represented Western Australia at the Australasian Convention in Sydney. From June 1886 to June 1887, he was on leave in England, and while there he represented Western Australia at the Colonial and Imperial Exhibition in London. In 1888, he represented the state at the Intercolonial Conference in Sydney. After Frederick Broome's tenure as Governor came to an end in December 1889, Fraser was appointed Administrator of Western Australia until the appointment of the next governor. William Robinson was appointed Governor in October 1890, and one of his first tasks was to institute responsible government. Under responsible government, the Executive Council was dissolved, and the office of Colonial Secretary became a ministerial portfolio. Rather than contest a parliamentary seat, Fraser decided to retire on his pension. He retired on 28 December 1890, and shortly afterwards set sail for London. In April 1892 he came out of retirement to accept the position of the first Agent General for Western Australia in London, which position he held until 1898. Malcolm Fraser died at Clifton on 17 August 1900. He was survived by his three sons and two daughters. His wife since 1861, Elizabeth n√©e Riddiford, had died four years earlier. Fraser was made CMG in 1881 and KCMG in 1897. Throughout his life Fraser had a reputation for his bad temper; Crowley (2000) referred to him as a man whose intemperate habits had been town gossip for years. In 1881, the Victorian government botanist, Ferdinand von Mueller named Eremophila fraseri in his honour.

Initially it runs east before turning south around the massif of Mount Kenya. A series of hydroelectric dams (the Seven Forks Hydro Stations or the Seven Forks Scheme) has been constructed along the river. These include (in order of cascading) the Masinga Dam (commissioned in 1981 with an installed capacity of 40MW), the Kamburu Dam (1974, 94.20MW), the Gitaru Dam (1978, 225.25MW), the Kindaruma Dam (1968, 72MW) and the Kiambere Dam (1988, 168MW).Adams, W.

The other three are used exclusively for HEP generation. A 2003 study reported that two-thirds of Kenya's electrical needs were supplied by the series of dams along the Tana River. Many people believe this river has groundwater underneath it, but it doesn't. The electricity is then supplied to the national grid system and distributed countrywide through a series of substations, transformers and cables. Location map of the River Tana Below the dams, the river turns north and flows along the north-south boundary between the Meru and North Kitui and Bisanadi, Kora and Rabole National Reserves. In the reserves the river turns east, and then south east. It passes through the towns of Garissa, Hola and Garsen before entering the Indian Ocean at the Ungwana Bay-Kipini area, at the end of a river delta that reaches roughly 30 km upstream from the river mouth itself. It runs through a desert, and irrigates the surrounding land. Annual flow is above 5,000 million cubic meters (MCM) on average, but varies substantially both within and across years, and includes two flood seasons each year Between 1944 and 1978, average total flow (at Garissa) was 6,105 MCM, varying from only 1,789 MCM in 1949 to 13,342 MCM in 1968.Hughes, F.

This type of ship came into existence during the Cold War as a development of the escort carriers used in the ASW role in the North Atlantic during World War II. Role After World War II, the main naval threat to most Western nations was confrontation with the Soviet Union. The Soviets ended the war with a small navy and took the route of asymmetric confrontation against Western surface ship superiority by investing heavily in submarines both for attack and later fielding submarine-launched missiles. Several nations who purchased British and US surplus light carriers were most easily able to accommodate slow-moving, less expensive, and easy-to-land anti- submarine aircraft from the 1960s forward, such as the S-2 Tracker, which flew from the decks of US, Canadian, Australian, Dutch, Argentine, and Brazilian carriers, or Aliz√©, which flew from French and Indian ships, allowing these ships to still remain useful especially in the framework of NATO even as newer fighter and strike aircraft were becoming too heavy for the equipment designed for World War II aircraft. Improvement in long-range shore-based patrol and conventional ship-based ASW helicopter capability combined with the increasing difficulty maintaining surplus WWII carriers led to most of these ships being retired or docked by smaller nations from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. This trend in ASW force draw-down only accelerated with the massive reduction in the operational Soviet/Russian submarine fleet, which rarely went to sea in large numbers in the 1990s. Ships that could be called dedicated ASW carriers are now only found within the Japan MSDF, which operates helicopters and no fixed-wing carrier-based aircraft of any kind. Even the United States Navy, the last nation to regularly operate a dedicated fixed-wing carrier-based ASW aircraft, the S-3 Viking, on its mixed-role super carriers had already removed most ASW equipment in the 1990s from this aircraft and has now removed this type from service as of January 2009 without replacement. The Argentine Navy, currently without much hope of a replacement CATOBAR carrier of its own, trained several times a year landings and takeoffs of their S-2 Turbo Trackers aboard the until this carrier was also retired. Much easier to operate from small decks than fixed-wing aircraft were ASW helicopters, which flew from the decks of nearly all allied conventional carriers to this day and most LPH or STOVL carriers operated by the Soviet, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British, and Thai navies.

They are considered the first rap group from Dallas to enjoy popularity in the US and world-wide, thanks to their label, Profile Records, which was well known for bringing out many popular east coast rap releases such as Run-DMC, Dr. Jeckyll & Mr. Hyde, and Dana Dane. Originally, Nemesis was called \\"Sumthin Fresh\\" and consisted of rappers MC Azim aka Lawrence Azim Rashid, Bhumble Bee, and Eazy Roque aka Charles Roquemore who were joined by DJ Snake aka Don Brown, Big Al aka Al English, Casanova Rock And MC AC. The rappers from Hamilton Park, MC AC From Oak Cliff and the DJs from Oak Cliff (both neighborhoods in Dallas) became part of the Dallas, Texas underground rap scene in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Known for their funk-structured compositions and loud bass lines, the group debuted with the single \\"Oak Cliff\\" in 1987, and followed up with several albums on Profile Records from 1989-1995. History As Sumthin Fresh, the group appeared regularly on KNON FM 90.9. Initially, they appeared as guests on Nippy Jones Freaky Fresh Friday afternoon show and after teaming up with DJ Snake for music production, they were regulars on the \\"All Hardy Def Party\\" radio show which became the metroplex's hottest radio show at the time. The radio show, which was hosted by DJ Snake, Big Al, and Casanova Rock, was most popular to young Dallas hip-hoppers who had no other options or outlets for rap music. Every Wednesday night, from 9pm til Midnight, Dallas/Fort Worth listeners were deluged with local artists, local sounds along with underground beats. Sumthin Fresh became local stars and Bumble Bee, feeling that Something Fresh was a bit soft, decided to change their name to Nemesis. DJ Snake is one of the earliest Dallas based hip-hop producers that began his career as a local DJ before helping co-found the independent Get Off Me Records in 1987. DJ Snake released his first single \\"Oak Cliff / Snake Beats\\" and helped produce for the hip-hop collective group Nemesis starting in 1988. Nemesis released their first album entitled, To Hell and Back on their independent record label, Get Off Me Records. Bumble Bee left the group shortly after they signed with Profile Records, due to creative and philosophical differences between himself and the producers. Eazy Roque also left soon after. This left MC Azim behind as the lone MC with the group. Big Al, one of the group's producer/deejays then manned a microphone in order to help complete the project, and reinvent the group's sound to feature more of bass oriented sound featuring beats by DJ Snake. Azim left the group before the release of Nemesis' 1993 Temple of Boom and was replaced by the previously solo rapper Ron C. Long-time member DJ Snake departed two years later in 1995, but the group moved forward with releasing The People Want Bass album without him. The group's last known recording is 2000's, Munchies for Your Bass, Da Return (Out tha Trunk, which was developed by Big Al along with a cast of up and coming Dallas artists such as Mabooda, Thyra, Trill Gatez, Big Pharoah, Throwed Johnson and more. The lead single, \\"Hold Up\\", produced by Trill Gatez, received heavy regional radio play and this subsequently led to several offers from major record labels including Universal Music Group. While on a promotional tour in Louisiana near Shreveport in late 2001, Big Al became ill during a performance. He later died of natural causes. Stylistically, they were inspired by many genres of music Gangsta rap, Miami bass, Metal as well as (in terms of lyrics) spirituality (inspired by Islam). DJ Snake went on to produce, mix and master tracks for many major and local artists. He then moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to work along with Too Short on his new record label Nation Riders/Jive Records. He produced and mixed artist Too Short, Lil Jon and The Eastside Boys, Mc Breed, T.I., E-40, UGK, Slink Capone, Bone Crusher, Quint Black, P Diddy and many more. After departing from Nemesis, DJ Snake released two albums along with DJ AK in the mid-1990s. Throughout that decade, DJ Snake played an important part in the Dallas - Ft. Worth hip-hop scene producing for many artists including P.K.O., Royal Flush, Ron C, Kottonmouth, Blofly and many other regional acts. In the late 1990s, DJ Snake was invited to produce for Bay Area rapper Too Short and has continued to contribute to his recent releases. Although in recent years DJ Snake has become more of a national artist, he is still one of Dallas - Ft. Worth's leading hip-hop musicians. DJ Snake worked on new music with Nemesis which was released on September 22, 2016.

It was adapted from a novel of the same name by Arthur Herzog. Directed by Irwin Allen, the cast features Michael Caine, Katharine Ross, Richard Widmark, Richard Chamberlain, Olivia de Havilland, Ben Johnson, Lee Grant, Jos√© Ferrer, Patty Duke, Slim Pickens, Bradford Dillman, Fred MacMurray, and Henry Fonda. It received very negative reviews from critics and was a box-office failure. The Swarm has been considered to be one of the worst movies ever made.Halliwell's film and video guide 2002 edited by John Walker. London. HarperCollins Entertainment, 2001. (p. 804). Despite this, it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Costume Design (Paul Zastupnevich). Plot A group of soldiers led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman) is ordered to investigate the basement level of a missile base, which appears to have been attacked, and the garrison all but wiped out. After Baker contacts his commander, General Slater (Richard Widmark), they begin to investigate a civilian van found parked at the base. It is revealed to be owned by a scientist, Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), one of the few survivors of the attack, but not someone stationed at the base. Slater orders two helicopters to track a large airborne mass moving slowly away from the base. The mass is revealed to be a swarm of bees, which engulfs the two helicopters, killing their crews. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by this swarm, composed of deadly African killer bees. Slater does not trust Crane, but Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story. Meanwhile, in the countryside, a family is attacked by a swarm of the bees. Their teenaged son, Paul Durant (Christian Juttner), manages to escape in a Mustang, although he is also stung, and crashes into the Marysville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, on account of the after effects of the bee stings. Much to Slater's annoyance, Crane is put in charge by the President and calls in many experts to help. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) arrives at the base and confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started with the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater must confront angry country bumpkin Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens), who demands to see the dead body of his son, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation, and overrules him, instead focusing on a solution that will kill the bees without harming people and the environment. Recovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and two of his friends go in search of the hive to firebomb it, which results only in angering the bees, which make their way to Marysville and kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf√© waitress Rita (Patty Duke). Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant), watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees engulf the train, as well, causing it to derail and crash, killing most of the occupants, including a love triangle made up of school superintendent Maureen Scheuster (Olivia de Havilland), retiree Felix Austin (Ben Johnson), and town mayor and drug-store owner Clarence Tuttle (Fred MacMurray). Confined to a hospital bed, Rita gives birth to her child, falling in love with the doctor in the process, but Paul, who has fallen ill again, succumbs to the after effects of the stings and dies, devastating Helena. The savage swarm heads for Houston, so Crane drops ecofriendly poison pellets designed by Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain) on them, but the bees ignore the pellets, evidently intelligent enough to sense danger. Working on an antidote to the bees' venom, Dr. Krim self-injects to keep track of the results; the trial proves fatal and Krim dies from the effects of the venom. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jos√© Ferrer), ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard, is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees. However, the bees invade the plant, killing both Andrews and Hubbard, as well as completely destroying the plant and wiping out an entire town. Washington orders that operations to stop the bees be placed under military control and Slater takes charge. He orders the evacuated city of Houston to be deliberately torched by soldiers with flamethrowers, hoping the conflagration will destroy the swarm. Helena, who was stung during the attack on Marysville, falls seriously ill again. Crane analyzes tapes from the original bee attack of the base and comes to the conclusion that their alarm system attracted the swarm into the base as the sound resembled a signal from the swarm's queen. The bees break into the headquarters building so Slater and Baker use a flamethrower to allow Crane and Helena to escape, but at the cost of their own lives. Helicopters successfully manage to lure the bees out to sea by placing floating buoys with speakers emitting the sound Crane discovered into an area of water doused with oil. When the swarm arrives, the oil is set ablaze by missiles fired from the nearby coast, destroying all of the bees. Cast Production The film was announced in 1974 at the height of the disaster-movie craze. It was part of $38 million worth of projects Irwin Allen had lined up, others including The Day the World Ended (a project which was retitled and released in 1980 as When Time Ran Out....) The script was written by Stirling Silliphant, who had written The Towering Inferno for Allen. He said in December 1974 that Allen hoped to start filming in April 1975. Production was delayed in part because Allen decided to leave Fox for Warner Bros. Estimates of the numbers of bees used in the production ranged between 15 million and 22 million, including 800,000 bees with their stingers removed to enable the cast to work safely with them. About 100 people were employed in the production to care for and transport the bees during the film shoot. Only one cast member, Olivia de Havilland, was stung during the production. Reception It was one of two disaster films (the other being Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (1979)) directed solely by the \\"master of disaster\\" Allen, who had experience directing several films and many episodes of his TV shows - and both featured Michael Caine in the leading role. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John J.B. Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made, where Wilson states that under Allen's unsubtle direction, \\"despite the enormous production budget, The Swarm turned the tale of an invasion of killer bees into the ultimate B movie.\\" It has a score of 10% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 20 reviews. Vincent Canby of The New York Times called the film \\"nothing less than the ultimate apotheosis of yesterday's B-movie.\\" Comparing the film unfavorably to recent blockbusters such as Star Wars and Grease, which also evoked old B-movies, he wrote, \\"Allen merely reproduces a tacky genre while spending a great deal of money doing it. There's not a frame of film, not a twist of plot, not a line of dialogue, not a performance in The Swarm that suggests real appreciation for film history, only a slavish desire to imitate it. That's not enough.\\"Canby, Vincent (July 23, 1978). \\"'The Swarm'‚ÄîA Bumbling 'B'\\". The New York Times. D20. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars and wrote that it was \\"surprisingly flaccid in its thrills\\", explaining: \\"In these days of Star Wars (which was made for less money), it takes more than a fleet of helicopters and a flameout on the Gulf of Mexico to convince audiences that they are being dazzled.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 18, 1978). \\"'Swarm': Lots of bees but hardly any honey\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 7. Arthur D. Murphy of Variety called it a \\"disappointing and tired non-thriller. Killer bees periodically interrupt the arch writing, stilted direction and ludicrous acting.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film was \\"fun in its primitive way\\", adding that \\"one wishes it were silent, as were the DeMille epics of the '20s it so closely resembles.\\"Thomas, Kevin (July 15, 1978). \\"'Swarm'‚ÄîBarks Worse Than Bite\\".

The Washington Post. E1. Richard Velt in the Wilmington Morning Star stated \\"The Swarm may not be the worst movie ever made. I'd have to see them all to be sure.

Leslie Halliwell called The Swarm a \\"very obvious disaster movie with risible dialogue\\", and suggested its commercial failure was partly due to the fact that prior to its release, several American television movies with similar plots had been broadcast. =Box office= The film grossed $5,168,142 in its opening weekend from more than 1,200 theatres and earned Warner Bros. rentals in the United States and Canada of $7.7 million. It was a considered a commercial failure. Score The musical score was composed by Academy Award winner Jerry Goldsmith and used French horns and such to sound like the humming of bees. The score originally was released on LP and cassette on Warner Bros. Records in 1978 at the same time of the film's release, but has long since gone out of print. An expanded, remastered score was released in 2002 in a limited edition by Prometheus Records and contained over 40 minutes of previously unreleased material. It has also gone out of print. In 2020, La-La Land Records issued a two-CD set with the complete film score and the 1978 soundtrack album.https://lalalandrecords.com/swarm-the- limited-edition-2-cd-set/ Home video and alternate versions The film was originally released in theaters at 116 minutes, but when released on laserdisc in 1992, it was extended to 156 minutes with additional scenes. This extended version is also included on all DVD releases worldwide, alongside a 22-minute documentary, \\"Inside The Swarm\\", and the original theatrical trailer. The Swarm was first released to DVD by Warner Home Video on August 6, 2002, then reissued on January 28, 2016, under their Warner Archive Collection sublabel. The film was also released on Blu-ray in September 2018, again through Warner Archive. Like the two previous DVD releases, it contains the 156-minute extended version, the original theatrical trailer, and the 22-minute making-of documentary. In the U.S., the film was given a PG rating by the MPAA. In the U.K., the film was released with an A certificate in 1978. The BBFC rated the extended version 12. Disclaimer The ending credits to the film included a disclaimer which read: \\"The African killer bee portrayed in this film bears absolutely no relationship to the industrious, hardworking American honey bee to which we are indebted for pollinating vital crops that feed our nation.\\" According to an article in HR published on February 24, 1978, the American Bee Association considered taking legal action against the film's producers for defaming the western honey bee, but whether the lawsuit was ever filed or not is unknown.

It lasted as a title in its own right for nearly 150 years and is still extant as part of the magazine Horticulture Week. History Founded in 1841 by the horticulturists Joseph Paxton, Charles Wentworth Dilke, John Lindley and the printer William Bradbury it originally took the form of a traditional newspaper, with both national and foreign news, but also with vast amounts of material sent in by gardeners and scientists, covering every conceivable aspect of gardening. Its first editor, John Lindley, was one of the founders. Another founder, Paxton, later also became editor. Prominent contributors included Charles Darwin and Joseph Hooker. By 1851, the circulation of The Gardeners' Chronicle was given as 6500. Compared with that of the far more eminent Observer at 6230, and The Economist at 3826, The Gardeners' Chronicle did astonishingly well. Possibly these figures include the Chronicle's large international readership. It was noted for its large advertising section and when the glass tax was abolished in 1845 and the huge interest generated by the Great Exhibition made personal, small-scale greenhouses possible, it became full of adverts for these, many designed by Paxton himself, and from the sales of which he generated a tidy income.

Nielsen (born 23 April 1950), is a Danish politician, member of the Folketing for the Socialist People's Party. He was Denmark's Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2014. He was leader of the Socialist People's Party from 1991 to 2005 and served as the Minister for Taxation from 2012 to 2013. Early life and education Born at Ribe, Nielsen studied social science and Danish at the University of Aarhus from 1973 to 1979, and in 1978 at the University of Belgrade.Lene Koogi (11 December 2013) Holger K. Nielsen napper sin anden ministerpost Danmarks Radio. Retrieved 14 December 2013 Political career He was elected to the Danish Parliament in 1987.Holger K. Nielsen Den Store Danske (online). Retrieved 14 December 2013 He became leader of the Socialist People's Party in 1991 at a time when the party was going through some major ideological soul-searching following the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe. The opposing candidate for the party leadership was Steen Gade, a self-styled moderniser intent on reforming the party in ways which the majority found too radical. Holger K. Nielsen was considered a 'safer' choice in the eyes of the party's old guard, and thus assumed the leadership allied to the more leftist elements in his party. Among the policies that had to be addressed was the party's approach to European integration. Having opposed membership of the EC (EU) in 1972, and then campaigned against ratification of the Single European Act in 1986, the party had by the late 1980s grudgingly reconciled itself to Danish membership, dropping the demand for withdrawal in 1990. However when the Maastricht Treaty came up for approval by referendum in 1992 the party remained true to its roots and recommended a 'NO' vote. Holger K. Nielsen became one of the leaders in this campaign, and was later judged to have swung far more than his own socialist voters towards the NO-side, which to great surprise emerged victorious by a wafer-thin margin. The following year, however, he reversed that position, recommending acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty, supplemented with the four Danish opt-outs. This decision came close to tearing the party apart, with some 60% of its voters remaining opposed, but this time the yes- side prevailed. During the years of the Poul Nyrup Rasmussen governments (1993‚Äì2001), Holger K. Nielsen managed to take the Socialist People's Party closer to the mainstream of Danish politics, positioning the party as a slightly more leftist alternative to the ruling Social Democrats. During this time the party entered into several major compromises with the government in many policy areas, including several state finance bills. However close the socialists moved to the government, though, they never quite became acceptable as coalition partners, much to the chagrin of Holger K. Nielsen. A real popular breakthrough also never materialised, despite the leader's high media profile. The party lost seats in both the 1994 and 2001 elections, only managing to hold on in the 1998 election. The party was successful in shoring up the centre-left governments of the 1990s. The party remained in the sceptic camp during the 1998 referendum campaign for the Amsterdam Treaty, a move which prompted several prominent pro-Europeans, such as Steen Gade and Christine Antorini, to leave politics. Again in 2000, when the issue was Denmark entering the Economic and Monetary Union, the Socialists were in the forefront of the successful NO-campaign, with Holger K. Nielsen taking a prominent lead. However later that same year, riding high in the opinion polls, Holger K. Nielsen performed a spectacular U-turn and made his party endorse the Nice Treaty, thus making a referendum avoidable. This was the opening shot in a campaign to turn the formerly EU-sceptic party into pro- Europeans, a process that culminated in late 2004, with the party's rank-and- file following Holger K. Nielsen's advice, and endorsing a pro-ratification stance towards the EU's Draft Constitution. Following the election in 2001 of a liberal-conservative coalition, the Socialist People's Party found themselves in opposition. After the 2005 parliamentary election, Holger K. Nielsen resigned as party leader. When Annette Vilhelmsen became new leader of the party in October 2012, Nielsen, who had been a strong supporter of Vilhelmsen's candidacy, was named new Minister of Taxation in the Cabinet of Helle Thorning-Schmidt. He later became the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the same cabinet until 30 January 2014, when the Socialist People's Party left the coalition and the Thorning-Schmidt II Cabinet was inaugurated. Nielsen is in his second marriage and has four children, two from each of the marriages.

It starts at Maridalsvannet in Oslomarka, and follows the urban areas Nordre Aker, Sagene, Gr√ºnerl√∏kka, Oslo centre and Gr√∏nland, whereby it finally ends at Paulsenkaien and Oset in Bj√∏rvika. The river is considered to be a part of the Nordmarkvassdraget, and has the watercourse number 006.Z. The entire river is about long, and has a difference in elevation between source and mouth of approximately . Earlier, the river gave power to numerous industry companies in Oslo. Akerselven is \\"Oslo‚Äôs green lung\\"; many parks and nature trails are found by its path, from Gr√∏nland to Maridalsvannet. Salmon run and spawn in the upper part of the river. Aker River in the 1970s was heavily contaminated after 150 years of industrial and sewage discharges along river. In the 1980s, a local initiative to limit emissions and revive the flora and fauna of the river began. Early in March 2011, Oslo's water and wastewater department accidentally discharged of chlorine into the river near its headwaters, rendering the river virtually dead as of 11 March 2011. According to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, the discharge occurred at the water treatment plant Oset.Akerselva d√∏d etter giftutslipp - NRK 8. mars 2011. Name A regulated shore at the bend of Akerselva in Kjels√•s The first element is the genitive case of Aker, the name of the old farm and churchsite that has named several places in Oslo. The last element is the finite form of the noun elv ('river'). The river is considered to be the border between the eastern and the western part of Oslo. In the eastern part people treat the word elv as a feminine noun, so they say elva ('the river'). The westside dialect is influenced by Danish (considered a more appropriate language during the union with Denmark), where the feminine and masculine genders have merged into a common gender inflected like Norwegian masculine nouns. Therefore, people in the western part often treat elv as a masculine noun, causing them to say elven ('the river'). The Old Norse name of the river was Frysja, and this old name has been revived as the name of a neighborhood along the river. The name is probably derived from the verb frusa 'froth', referring to the many waterfalls in the river. Overview, geology and waterfalls Overview, geology and waterfalls The Akerselva flows from Maridalsvannet north of the city to Bj√∏rvika, 9.8 km further down. The fall is 149 meters. The entire river course is in the construction zone, while the precipitation field is in Nordmarka. The rocks in the ground below the river are syenite (northern market) and hornfels from Bj√∏lsen and northwards, while the ground south of Bj√∏lsen is mainly clay slate and tuber lime. Syenite and hornfels are hard rocks that are hard to decompose. The river is located in the geological Oslo field, where subsidence areas are formed by stretches in the earth's crust, blocks are separated and middle parts sink in, allowing for rivers to cut down. The softer rocks further south hard formed the basis for brickwork on Myral√∏kka and √òvre Foss (V√•ghalsen), which in the 1840s was the country's largest, and large slides in the river, hence the street name Leirfallsgata at the bottom of Gr√ºnerl√∏kka. In √òvre Foss lies a slab of solidified volcanic melt that has come up in a crack, which is tougher and harder than lime and slate and a reason why the waterfall is here. Up in Nydalen, there are steep erosion cliffs that are part of the Grefsen moraine. The river has cut its way through thick masses of gravel, sand and clay that formed in front of the inland ice that receded about 9800 years ago (the Akert Step). At the largest bathtub at Stilla and at the gutters between the grasslands at Brekkedammen, there is visible syenite (circular swab) with clear scouring strips from the glacier. At Nedre Foss there is visible tuber lime, black clay slate and limestone (orthocer lime). About 10,000 years ago, the sea rose 220 meters higher than today, about 9300 years ago the sea was 150 meters so that the Maridal waters were separated from the fjord and the Akerselva was born. , 6,000 years ago was the waterline at Myral√∏kka and 3,000 years ago at Cuba. The 20 waterfalls are, from above: Kjels√•s fall Brekkefossen Nydalsfossen, also called Nyg√•rdsfossen Gullhaugfossen, at Gullhaug square Bj√∏lsenfossen (two falls, fall height 16 meters), at Treschow's bridge Lilleborgfossen, fall height 3 meters Hjulafossen, below the V√∏yen Bridge, which together with the V√•ghalsen form the V√∏yen Falls Daredevil, below the Beyer Bridge Upper Waterfall, also called the Seilduksfossen Nedre Foss, several falls, at the silo in Cuba A lot of stone has been used in river banks and bridges: At the Vaterland Park, a rocky mountain of gray √òstfold granite from Hvaler has been recreated, the same has been used in the bridges in Hausmann's bridge.

Some aspects of this material may be considered historical; others are certainly mythological. A pair of swords was forged by and named after them. History According to the historical text Wuyue Chunqiu, King Hel√º of Wu ordered Gan Jiang and Mo Ye to forge a pair of swords for him in three months.Zhao, Ye (c. 50). Wuyue Chunqiu (Wu and Yue in the Spring and Autumn period). However, the blast furnace failed to melt the metal. Mo Ye suggested that there was insufficient human qi in the furnace so the couple cut their hair and nails and cast them into the furnace, while 300 children helped to blow air into the bellows. In another account, Mo Ye sacrificed herself to increase human qi by throwing herself into the furnace. The desired result was achieved after three years and the two swords were named after the couple. Gan Jiang kept the male sword, Ganjiang, for himself and presented the female sword, Moye, of the pair to the king. The king was already very unpleasant since he ordered the sword made in three months time but Ganjiang did not come back in three years, when he discovered Gan Jiang had kept the male sword, he was angered and had Gan Jiang killed. Before his death, Gan Jiang had already predicted the king's reaction, so he left behind a message for Mo Ye and their unborn son telling them where he had hidden the Ganjiang Sword. Several months later, Mo Ye gave birth to Gan Jiang's son, Chi (Ëµ§), and years later she told him his father's story. Chi was eager to avenge his father and he sought the Ganjiang Sword. At the same time, the king dreamed of a youth who desired to kill him and, in fear, he placed a bounty on the youth's head. Chi was indignant and, filled with anguish, he started crying on his way to enact his vengeance. An assassin found Chi, who told the assassin his story. The assassin then suggested that Chi surrender his head and sword, and the assassin himself will avenge Ganjiang in Chi's place. He did as told and committed suicide. The assassin was moved and decided to help Chi fulfill his quest. The assassin severed Chi's head and brought it, along with the Ganjiang sword to the overjoyed king. The king was however uncomfortable with Chi's head staring at him, and the assassin asked the king to have Chi's head boiled, but Chi's head was still staring at the king even after 40 days without any sign of decomposition, thus the assassin told the king that he needed to take a closer look and stare back in order for the head to decompose under the power of the king. The king bent over the cauldron and the assassin seized the opportunity to decapitate him, his head falling into the cauldron alongside Chi's. The assassin then cut off his own head, which also fell into the boiling water. The flesh on the heads was boiled away such that none of the guards could recognize which head belonged to whom. The guards and vassals decided since all three should be honoured as kings (With Chi and the assassin being so brave and loyal). The three heads were eventually buried together at Yichun County, Runan, Henan, and the grave is called \\"Tomb of Three Kings\\".Gan, Bao.

For all its remoteness, Hammerfest has a long history as a trading port, and Polar Bear Club sets out to commemorate this. In the museum's single room are a variety of mementos of the early life of Hammerfest, including a profusion of stuffed animals, early Arctic hunting, traveling and camping equipment, and a gallery of photographs, paintings, drawings and writings of and from the town's history. These depict the town as it was in previous centuries, showing that as far back as the seventeenth century, this tiny town was a nexus for travelers and traders in the far north and a meeting point for the isolated people of North Norway, traders sailing up from southern Europe and hunters and traders coming west from the Arctic Ocean and Russia. Founded in 1963 by two local businessmen, the Polar Bear Club is not particularly ancient. Primarily, it is a somewhat jokey amenity for tourists. Although entrance to the actual exhibition is free of charge, visitors are encouraged to join the Society, which is rewarded with a membership pack, the contents of which include a certificate signed by the actual mayor, a sticker, a membership card and a lapel pin made of silver and enamel.

Released in October 2002 as the sequel to RollerCoaster Tycoon, the game simulates the management of amusement parks. The features and expansions were later ported to RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic in 2017. Gameplay An in-game screenshot of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 showing the user interface and some rides RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 tasks players with managing amusement parks in different scenarios with the goal of having them succeed in different ways. The game returns to isometric projection which debuted with the predecessor, allowing for a large degree of compatibility. Various attractions, including transport rides, gentle rides, thrill rides, roller coasters, water rides, and shops or stalls, can be added to the parks as well as landscaping and decorations. The player satisfies the needs of the visitors by building food stalls, bathrooms, and souvenir shops as well as facilities and services, such as ATMs and information kiosks, as well as hiring staff. Players must balance their budget in their expenses and income while doing this. One notable difference from RollerCoaster Tycoon is a more robust system for building structures, in which one can lay each piece of wall and roof individually. The game provides greater flexibility by allowing pieces of scenery, rides, and other structures to be placed at varying heights above and below ground. The mechanics in the predecessor made custom building construction less efficient, and rides and shops were previously unable to be built at varying elevations; in that game, only rides that had tracks could be built underground, since the first section of any ride had to be placed above ground. Many of the rides from the original RollerCoaster Tycoon have been modified and/or renamed. Some old ride designs have been merged with others. User-created scenery items make a debut in this title. The 'bulldozer' allows the player to remove multiple pieces of scenery instead of only one piece at a time. A scenario editor is introduced, which allows players to create their own scenarios, creating the landscape, setting objectives, and selecting available rides and scenery. Players can make and test their own roller coasters to save them for use in other levels with the Roller Coaster Designer, and the game includes a licensed promotion by Six Flags to include their own content and scenarios based on five of their amusement park branches, including Magic Mountain, Great Adventure, and Over Texas. Walibi Holland and Walibi Belgium were also under the Six Flags brands during development, and were also included. Many popular rides in Six Flags amusement parks can be used in other scenarios, but are locked from editing. The game also contains a variety of new themes and music for attractions. Guests' AI was improved from the original game, allowing for the creation of more complex paved areas. All of the scenarios in RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 are available at first launch (which contrasts RollerCoaster Tycoons unlocking system), and they are divided into five folder tabs: Beginner, Challenging, Expert, Real, and Other parks. The 'Real' tab contains the Six Flags parks preconstructed, while the 'Other' tab contains their empty versions. When creating a scenario, the player can save to any of the tabs. As with the previous game, players could upload their saved track designs onto the now- defunct 'Ride Exchange.' Track designs from both games can later be imported into RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 where they are no longer locked to the isometric views. Development Screenshot of the OpenRCT2 open-source reimplementation, showing the user interface RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 was developed by Chris Sawyer who designed and programmed the game entirely by himself in assembly language. Some parts of the game were based on efforts to develop a new version of Transport Tycoon, which Sawyer had been working on as early as 1996. The game was published by Infogrames and released on October 15, 2002.RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 Patch on atari.com by Joseph Paolinelli on 13 October 2011 Release Much like with the first game, two expansion packs were released for Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, which included new rides, facilities, and scenarios. The first pack, Wacky Worlds, was released in May 2003, the second pack, Time Twister, was released in November 2003. Each packs were based around themes and didn't have any involvement from the series' creator Chris Sawyer. Instead both expansions were developed by Frontier Developments, who developed the Xbox port of the original game, and would go on to develop the entirety of RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 and its spiritual successor, Planet Coaster. Around the time of Time Twister release; Atari released RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Combo Park Pack, which was a compilation of the base game and Wacky Worlds on separate discs. This was followed in 2004 with the release of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2: Triple Thrill Pack, which was a compilation of the base game and both expansions on a single disc. Triple Thrill Pack was later released on digital distribution platforms such as GOG.com and Steam. In July 2014, these versions were updated to include European language localizations, which were previously available as separate retail versions. Reception Dan Adams of IGN gave Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 an 8/10, praising the game for the addition of the scenario and ride editor, as well as worth in value. Brett Todd of GameSpot gave it a 7/10, praising the game's for the \\"more depth\\" audio and its new editors, but criticized the game for not addressing many of the issues of the first game. Greg Bemis of TechTV's X-Play praised the game for its improvements in customization but criticized the game for a lack of a sandbox mode. Martin Taylor of Eurogamer praised the game for its inclusion of scenarios based on actual Six Flags parks but criticized the game's outdated graphics, contrasting it to SimCity 4. Taylor also criticized the scenario editor for its outdated tools, preferring that it would have been given away for free for the first game. A major criticism for RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 at the time of its release was that the game engine and interface were almost identical to the first game, with minor improvements in graphics, such as more images for coaster cars, allowing for smoother animations. Dana Jongewaard of Computer Gaming World suggested that the game needed \\"consistent back buttons for the interface\\" that would \\"save a lot of time that's spent closing and reopening windows\\" and stated that \\"a shift from 2D to 3D would have been a great way to showcase these new coasters.\\" =Sales= Before the release of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, global sales of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series had surpassed 6 million units, including more than 4 million units in North America. This success led Dan Adams of IGN to call the sequel \\"basically a foregone conclusion\\". The series' combined sales‚Äîincluding those of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, Wacky Worlds and Time Twister‚Äîrose to 7 million copies by April 2004. The NPD Group declared Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 the 10th-best-selling computer game of 2002, and the 12th-best-selling of 2003. In the United States, RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 sold 940,000 copies and earned $21.6 million by August 2006. Edge ranked it as the country's eighth best-selling computer game released between January 2000 and August 2006, and as the country's best-selling RollerCoaster Tycoon game released in that period. RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 also received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Legacy Several user-created rollercoasters received media attention after footage of them were posted on various imageboards and social media. The RollerCoaster Tycoon series spawned a popular Internet meme based on a series of posts made in 2012 on 4chan featuring a slow, 30,696ft ghost train track ride made in RCT2 called \\"Mr. Bones' Wild Ride\\" that took four in-game years to complete, leading the passengers in the game express \\"I want to get off Mr. Bones Wild Ride\\". At the ride's conclusion, the passengers were then greeted by a skeleton prop with a top hat, with a sign stating \\"The ride never ends\\". Both phrases have become popular memes.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3kvkd8/a-brief-history-of-skeleton- memes In April 2014, an open-source project, known as OpenRCT2, was launched to enhance the gameplay of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2, including fixing bugs and allowing the game to run natively on macOS and Linux. The project began as a one-man endeavour by the software developer Ted John, but has since had over 250 contributors improve the game. In order to create an accurate clone, the game was incrementally reverse engineered and re-written in the C programming language. OpenRCT2 features reduced limitations compared to the original, which allows players to more easily create bigger and more complex parks. Other features include the ability to fast forward the current scenario and multiplayer which allows players to build parks cooperatively. It also fixes many bugs and expands upon the original game's technical limitations.

He was also a great- grandfather of Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, who was the husband of Princess Margaret. Early life and education Edward Linley Sambourne was born in the family home at 15 Lloyd Square in Pentonville, London 4 January 1844. He was the only surviving child of Edward Mott Sambourne, a furrier merchant in the City of London. His mother Frances Linley was the daughter of Peter Linley, who followed into the family business of scythe manufacture near Sheffield. Linley was educated at various schools throughout England. Aged 10 or 11 he enrolled as a pupil in the City of London School, but by 1857 he was at a school in Sheffield. From late 1857 to 1860 he had again enrolled in a new school, the Chester Training College, where he was encouraged to pursue his talent for drawing. In 1860, aged 16, Linley enrolled in the South Kensington School of Art but only stayed a couple of months. Punch Self portrait of Linley Sambourne modelling (10 January 1895) for Punch cartoon 'Quite English, You Know! In 1861 Sambourne was apprenticed to John Penn & Son, marine engineers of Greenwich. Initially he worked under the founder's son, John Penn Jr, but was moved to the drawing office when his employer discovered his aptitude for draft drawing. In his spare time Sambourne continued to draw caricatures and study the great graphic artists such as William Hogarth and Albrecht D√ºrer. One version Sambourne recounts about the events leading to his introduction to Punch's editor Mark Lemon is that his friend and fellow employee at Penn's, Alfred German Reed, showed one of his sketches to his father, the theatrical impresario Thomas German Reed. At his son's urging Thomas passed the drawing on to Mark Lemon. Lemon was sufficiently impressed by the sketch that he encouraged Sambourne to take art lessons and consult the engraver Joseph Swain about drawing on wood. Pleased with the results, Lemon published a drawing by Sambourne in the 27 April 1867 issue of Punch. This was an initial letter 'T' showing the politician John Bright striking a quintain. Initially employed on a casual basis by Lemon, Sambourne was asked to supply the decorated initial letters that stood at head of articles, stories and poems incorporating the first letter into a fanciful design. Between 1867 and 1874 Sambourne contributed 350 initial letters. Although Sambourne's distinctive style emerged only slowly, he became a regular staff member of Punch in 1871. At the beginning he made his name by his \\"social\\" drawings while continuing to provide his highly elaborated initial letters. He drew his first political cartoon, properly so-called, in 1884, and ten years later began regularly to design the weekly second cartoon. At the end of John Tenniel's long occupancy in 1901, he became the magazin's chief principal cartoonist. Unusually for a black and white artist, Sambourne used a huge library of photographic images to give accuracy to his work, which was characterized by a vivid and decisive linearity as well as an artistic inventiveness that took his images far beyond the simple concept of a cartoon or \\"comic cut\\". The quality of his work for Punch was acknowledged by the Royal Academy, which exhibited his drawings over a 20-year period. Other works While his work for Punch occupied most of his energy, it was not Sambourne's only source of income, as he would often accept commissions for individuals, books, magazines and advertisements. These include: Book illustrations * Military Men I have met ..., Edward Dyne Fenton, 1872 * Our Autumn Holiday on French Rivers ..., James Lynam Molly, 1874 * Our Holiday in the Scottish Highlands, Arthur √† Beckett, 1876 * The Royal Umbrella.

Descendants Edward Linley Sambourne married Mary Ann (Marion) Herapath (1851‚Äì1914) in 1874. She was the eldest daughter of the nine children of Spencer Herapath, a successful stockbroker, and his wife Mary Ann Walker. The couple had two children: Maud (born 1875) and Mawdley, also known as Roy (born 1878). Mawdley (Roy) Herapath Sambourne (1878‚Äì1946) did not marry. In 1898 his sister Maud Frances Sambourne (1875‚Äì1960) married Leonard Messel, a young stockbroker and collector. They had three children: Linley (born 1899), Anne born 1902 (first married to Major Ronald Armstrong-Jones, later to Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse), and Oliver Messel (an acclaimed set designer and architect) born 1904. Further descendants of Edward Linley Sambourne include: his great-grandson Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon (the photographer and documentary filmmaker), and great-great-grandson David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon (the furniture designer and chairman of Christie's auction house). Due to the large number of photographs taken of himself posing as a model for drawings, Boston-based journalist Susan Zalkind has suggested that her great- great-great-grandfather, Sambourne, is the \\"grandfather of the selfie.\\" See also *Linley Sambourne House References Further reading  * External links * Portrait of Linley Sambourne by Harry Furniss *Linley Sambourne House *Sambourne's Illustrations from Punch in HeidICON *Sambourne's personal diary for 1906 * 1844 births 1910 deaths English cartoonists Sambourne, Linley People from Pentonville Place of death missing ","title":"Edward Linley Sambourne"},{"id":"1784964","text":"St. Olaf's chapel from inside Pellinki (Pellinge in Swedish) is an island community in Finland made up of several small islands, the main ones linked by bridges.

Pellinki is accessible from the Finnish mainland via a small vehicle/pedestrian ferry from Tirmo. The ferry runs at 15-minutes intervals and is provided free, as such ferries are considered an integral part of the national road network.

There is a school which teaches pupils in grades 1-4 of the Finnish education system (from grade 5, pupils must attend schools on the mainland). There is also a daycare centre for pre-school children. Both these institutions use the Swedish language as the medium for instruction. Pellinki has its own graveyard and also a chapel dedicated to St. Olaf. The community has several organisations that are well attended and participated. For instance, there is a voluntary fire brigade and two Martha unions (a Finnish women's society). Traditional ways of life on Pellinki include fishing, boat building, forestry, axe throwing and agriculture - although these have all declined significantly in recent times.

The Museum of Reconstruction for Finnmark and North Troms () is a museum in the town of Hammerfest, Norway. As was much of Northern Norway, the entire town of Hammerfest was razed to the ground by the retreating Nazi German military forces at the end of World War II. The museum commemorates this event with a wide range of displays, including both photographs and many items from the town from around that time. The first part of the main sequence of exhibits, on the ground floor, depicts the events themselves; the second consists largely of a series of reconstructions of the town during and following its reconstruction. There are homes, workplaces and other such tableaux, composed mostly of authentic items retained from that time, clearly showing how shockingly basic life was at first as the town's residents rebuilt their homes and lives, literally and exactly from the ground up. Since the locals knew the troops were coming and what they would do, there was a little time to prepare. The local barber's pride and joy was his authentic American barbershop chair, imported from Chicago before the war. As many people did with their most precious possessions, he wrapped the chair in tarpaulin and buried it in his garden. When the building was reconstructed some years later, he dug up the chair and it was proudly reinstated in his parlour, where it remained for some decades. Now, it is in the museum. Later displays on the tour show how life progressed in the postwar years. Single-room dwellings housing whole families were gradually replaced with multiple rooms, then the standard of furnishings starts to rise. By the 1950s, there are Norwegian- language fashion magazines in the home, reflecting the fact that by this time there is an actual choice of furnishings, clothing and so on available and that people once again have enough disposable income to spend on non- essentials. This is arguably due to the rapid growth in the Norwegian economy around this time. As the town slopes steeply away from its shore and harbour, and the museum is situated some way inland, the building's central tower is one of the town's tallest structures and commands panoramic views across the whole region. Each floor of the tower contains a photo gallery; these successively show the phases of architecture in the region. Attached to the museum is a secondary, subsidiary museum concerning the history of telecommunications in Norway, especially the construction of the 19th Century CE telegraph system which linked the outlying regions of this vast and often hostile and nearly impassable country. The museum is arguably of primary interest to Norwegian nationals, many of whom travel through Hammerfest when taking the Hurtigruten steamship line, whose ships call in there daily, all year round, on their way between Bergen and Kirkenes in the far east of the country. Since a typical visit is of only two or three hours, there is little time to visit both the Isbj√∏rnklubben and the Museum of Reconstruction and to explore the town. Most of the displays in the main museum are labelled only in Norwegian. One can, however, borrow foreign language guidebooks (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Finnish and Sami). These are also displayed in the museums homepage www.gjenreisningsmuseet.no. The telecomms section is also multilingual.

It is a more general version of the linear classifier. The classification problem Statistical classification considers a set of vectors of observations x of an object or event, each of which has a known type y. This set is referred to as the training set. The problem is then to determine for a given new observation vector, what the best class should be. For a quadratic classifier, the correct solution is assumed to be quadratic in the measurements, so y will be decided based on : \\\\mathbf{x^T A x} + \\\\mathbf{b^T x} + c In the special case where each observation consists of two measurements, this means that the surfaces separating the classes will be conic sections (i.e. either a line, a circle or ellipse, a parabola or a hyperbola). In this sense we can state that a quadratic model is a generalization of the linear model, and its use is justified by the desire to extend the classifier's ability to represent more complex separating surfaces. Quadratic discriminant analysis Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) is closely related to linear discriminant analysis (LDA), where it is assumed that the measurements from each class are normally distributed. Unlike LDA however, in QDA there is no assumption that the covariance of each of the classes is identical. When the normality assumption is true, the best possible test for the hypothesis that a given measurement is from a given class is the likelihood ratio test. Suppose there are only two groups, (so y \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1 \\\\\\\\} ), and the means of each class are defined to be \\\\mu_{y=0},\\\\mu_{y=1} and the covariances are defined as \\\\Sigma_{y=0}, \\\\Sigma_{y=1} . Then the likelihood ratio will be given by :Likelihood ratio = \\\\frac{ \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi \\\\Sigma_{y=1}}^{-1} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\\\mu_{y=1})^T \\\\Sigma_{y=1}^{-1} (x-\\\\mu_{y=1}) \\\\right) }{ \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi \\\\Sigma_{y=0}}^{-1} \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac{1}{2}(x-\\\\mu_{y=0})^T \\\\Sigma_{y=0}^{-1} (x-\\\\mu_{y=0}) \\\\right)} < t for some threshold t . After some rearrangement, it can be shown that the resulting separating surface between the classes is a quadratic. The sample estimates of the mean vector and variance-covariance matrices will substitute the population quantities in this formula. Other While QDA is the most commonly used method for obtaining a classifier, other methods are also possible. One such method is to create a longer measurement vector from the old one by adding all pairwise products of individual measurements. For instance, the vector : [x_1, \\\\; x_2, \\\\; x_3] would become : [x_1, \\\\; x_2, \\\\; x_3, \\\\; x_1^2, \\\\; x_1x_2, \\\\; x_1 x_3, \\\\; x_2^2, \\\\; x_2x_3, \\\\; x_3^2] . Finding a quadratic classifier for the original measurements would then become the same as finding a linear classifier based on the expanded measurement vector. This observation has been used in extending neural network models; the \\"circular\\" case, which corresponds to introducing only the sum of pure quadratic terms \\\\; x_1^2 + x_2^2 + x_3^2 \\\\;\\\\ldots \\\\; with no mixed products ( \\\\; x_1 x_2, \\\\; x_1 x_3 \\\\; \\\\ldots \\\\; ), has been proven to be the optimal compromise between extending the classifier's representation power and controlling the risk of overfitting (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension). For linear classifiers based only on dot products, these expanded measurements do not have to be actually computed, since the dot product in the higher-dimensional space is simply related to that in the original space. This is an example of the so-called kernel trick, which can be applied to linear discriminant analysis, as well as the support vector machine.

Gerda, as a young woman, was in contact with the vanguards of the arts and education in the early 20th century. From the 30s on, she started to develop her innovative method through her studies between movement and musicality, new pedagogies and neurosciences. Through Eutony, she collaborated with many medical centers and congresses, pedagogical institutions and artistic training in Europe, North and South America and the Middle East. Gerda Alexander was a pioneer among the creators of somatic education practices in the world. Her school in Copenhagen trained professionals for 45 years.  Life and work  Gerda Alexander was born in Wuppertal, Germany and her parents were enthusiasts of Dalcroze Eurhythmics, passing on to her a similar interest in arts and movement. Gerda was born under the influence of √âmile-Jacques Dalcroze in Germany. Gerda mentions that the \\"first contact [she] had with Dalcroze's work was some photographs from the first festival in Hellerau in 1911\\". She enrolled in the school of Otto Blensdorf (the Blensdorf-Schulen) in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, and was graduated in the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin in 1929. During this period, Dalcroze Rhythmics was taught in all large universities and music schools in Germany, and Gerda was teaching the method between Wuppertal, Jena and Bonn. When Gerda was around 16-17, she contracted a rheumatic fever and endocarditis, what hindered her mobility. Gerda had to find ways to move that would not overload her circulatory system, and during this time she was hospitalized many times. By her own difficulties, the ongoing reflections with her students of all ages and an enthusiastic inquiry about personal artistic development, she started to research new ways of moving. In her own words: \\"I tried to find out how I could develop every person's own expression without programming him/her. At the same time, there was my personal need to learn how to survive\\". With an invitation to work as assistant to Otto and Charlotte Blensdorf at the world congress of \\"New Education Fellowship\\", and lately to teach between Denmark and Sweden, Gerda moved to Copenhagen. With the Second World War, Gerda decided to stay, and she lived in Copenhagen almost her whole life. In 1959, Gerda Alexander was responsible for the \\"First International Congress for Release of Tension and Functional Movement\\" that took place in Copenhagen under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Education. On this event, she not only gathered many psychosomatic researchers of that time, but also made public the name of her new method. Gerda worked regularly in partnership with institutions like: Fr√∂bel Schools, Philharmonie Malm√∂, Private Theater School, the Royal Theatre Copenhagen, the Theater Academy, Danish Broadcasting House (orchestra, choir and staff), Royal Music Conservatory, Danmarks L√¶rerh√∏jskole (Teacher training college - Department of music), Rigshospital, Dalcroze Societies, CEMEA - Centres d'Entrainement aux M√©thodes d'Education Active, and others. She gave lectures and workshops in Danmark, Sweden, Norway, France, Austria, Germany, Switzerland, USA, Israel, Greece, Italy, Holland, Mexico, Venezuela, Belgium and Argentina. Gerda Alexander died six days after her 86th birthday in Wuppertal, where she lived for the last few years. Her students today continue her work in several places in the world. = Historical Influences = alt= These were the main historical influences on Gerda's work, according to Jean-Marie Huberty: * Fran√ßois Delsarte * Elsa Gindler * Bildungsanstalt Jacques Dalcroze in Hellerau - today HELLERAU ‚Äì Europ√§isches Zentrum der K√ºnste * Ausdruckstanz * Rosalia Chladek * Schlaffhorst-Andersen Schule Atem-Stimme und Bewegung - today CJD Schule Schlaffhorst-Andersen Bad Nenndorf * Stanislavski Method, via Marussia Bergh * Eurythmy * Jena Plan * CEMEA  The creation of Eutony  Gerda Alexander found ways of regulating neuromuscular tone, what was confirmed later with the discovery of Gama System.. The word \\"eutony\\" (from Greek Eu: good - and Latin Tonus: tension, the grade of tension or elasticity of muscle fibers) was coined with the help of the Dr. med. Alfred Bartussek to express the idea of a harmoniously balanced \\"tonicity in constant adaptation to the state or activity of the moment\\". According to Gerda, \\"we use high tonus for effort, and medium tonus or low tonus for rest and sleep. In Eutony, we learn to use the best tonus for the action in question.\\" In the development of Eutony, Gerda Alexander was deeply concerned with a pedagogical approach that could support the experience of tonus modulation. Eutony is based in a student-centered learning process, where the personal sensorial experience is the base for all knowledge. She postulated that \\"it is important, in treatment, not to give and do more than is necessary, so that the other can rely on himself. It is not that I am a great master who gives you help. Rather, I can introduce you to my work for your own self-discovery.\\" center  The Gerda Alexander School  alt=Gerda Alexander opened a school in Copenhagen in 1939 by the name of \\"Gerda Alexander Skolen\\". The professional training in Eutony includes subjects as: Eutony (practice and theory, pedagogy and therapy), speech training, psychology, anatomy, physiology, neurology, neurophysiology, neuropathology, psychiatry and visiting seminars form specialists about current development in neurophysiology and other relevant disciplines. In 1957, the school got state technical college recognition, with a three to four years training with diploma.

It currently has an estimated 13,800 inhabitants. In 1818 the colony Katharinenfeld was founded in Bolnisi by 95 German colonist families from Swabia. After the occupation of the Red Army in 1921, it was renamed to Luxemburg after the German communist Rosa Luxemburg. In 1941 all the Germans descendants who were not married to Georgians were deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan. There are still remnants of the German past in Bolnisi. A small graveyard and plaque acknowledges the German influence in the village. A small street called Mill Street has evidence of 19th-century German architecture and a few signs in the German language that date from the early 20th century. In 1944, the town was once again renamed as Bolnisi. The economy is mostly agrarian with the notable exceptions of a winery, brewery, and a gold mine in the nearby village of Kazreti.

This constant is named after William H. Mills who proved in 1947 the existence of A based on results of Guido Hoheisel and Albert Ingham on the prime gaps. Its value is unknown, but if the Riemann hypothesis is true, it is approximately 1.3063778838630806904686144926... . Mills primes The primes generated by Mills' constant are known as Mills primes; if the Riemann hypothesis is true, the sequence begins :2, 11, 1361, 2521008887, 16022236204009818131831320183, 4113101149215104800030529537915953170486139623539759933135949994882770404074832568499, \\\\ldots . If ai denotes the ith prime in this sequence, then ai can be calculated as the smallest prime number larger than a_{i-1}^3. In order to ensure that rounding A^{3^n}, for n = 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶, produces this sequence of primes, it must be the case that a_i < (a_{i-1}+1)^3. The Hoheisel‚ÄìIngham results guarantee that there exists a prime between any two sufficiently large cubic numbers, which is sufficient to prove this inequality if we start from a sufficiently large first prime a_1. The Riemann hypothesis implies that there exists a prime between any two consecutive cubes, allowing the sufficiently large condition to be removed, and allowing the sequence of Mills primes to begin at a1 = 2. For all a > e^{e^{34}}, there is at least one prime between a^3 and (a+1)^3 . This upper bound is much too large to be practical, as it is infeasible to check every number below that figure. However, the value of Mills' constant can be verified by calculating the first prime in the sequence that is greater than that figure. As of April 2017, the 11th number in the sequence is the largest one that has been proved prime. It is :\\\\displaystyle (((((((((2^3+3)^3+30)^3+6)^3+80)^3+12)^3+450)^3+894)^3+3636)^3+70756)^3+97220 and has 20562 digits . , the largest known Mills probable prime (under the Riemann hypothesis) is :\\\\displaystyle ((((((((((((2^3+3)^3+30)^3+6)^3+80)^3+12)^3+450)^3+894)^3+3636)^3+70756)^3+97220)^3+66768)^3+300840)^3+1623568 , which is 555,154 digits long. Numerical calculation By calculating the sequence of Mills primes, one can approximate Mills' constant as :A\\\\approx a(n)^{1/3^n}. used this method to compute 6850 base 10 digits of Mills' constant under the assumption that the Riemann hypothesis is true. There is no closed-form formula known for Mills' constant, and it is not even known whether this number is rational . If it is rational, and if we can calculate its decimal expansion to the point where it repeats, this will allow us to generate infinitely many provable primes. Fractional representations Below are fractions which approximate Mills' constant, listed in order of increasing accuracy (with continued-fraction convergents in bold) : 1/1, 3/2, 4/3, 9/7, 13/10, 17/13, 47/36, 64/49, 81/62, 145/111, 226/173, 307/235, 840/643, 1147/878, 3134/2399, 4281/3277, 5428/4155, 6575/5033, 12003/9188, 221482/169539, 233485/178727, 245488/187915, 257491/197103, 269494/206291, 281497/215479, 293500/224667, 305503/233855, 317506/243043, 329509/252231, 341512/261419, 353515/270607, 365518/279795, 377521/288983, 389524/298171, 401527/307359, 413530/316547, 425533/325735, 4692866/3592273, 5118399/3918008, 5543932/4243743, 5969465/4569478, 6394998/4895213, 6820531/5220948, 7246064/5546683,7671597/5872418, 8097130/6198153, 8522663/6523888, 8948196/6849623, 9373729/7175358, 27695654/21200339, 37069383/28375697, 46443112/35551055, 148703065/113828523, 195146177/149379578, 241589289/184930633, 436735466/334310211, 1115060221/853551055, 1551795687/1187861266, 1988531153/1522171477, 3540326840/2710032743, 33414737247/25578155953, ... Generalisations There is nothing special about the middle exponent value of 3. It is possible to produce similar prime- generating functions for different middle exponent values. In fact, for any real number above 2.106..., it is possible to find a different constant A that will work with this middle exponent to always produce primes. Moreover, if Legendre's conjecture is true, the middle exponent can be replaced with value 2 . Matom√§ki showed unconditionally (without assuming Legendre's conjecture) the existence of a (possibly large) constant A such that \\\\lfloor A^{2^{n}} \\\\rfloor is prime for all n . Additionally, T√≥th proved that the floor function in the formula could be replaced with the ceiling function, so that there exists a constant B such that : \\\\lceil B^{r^{n}} \\\\rceil is also prime- representing for r>2.106\\\\ldots .

In the serial, set on the planet Inter Minor, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and his travelling companion Jo Grant (Katy Manning) are trapped inside a miniscope, a device used by the showman Vorg (Leslie Dwyer) to shrink life forms and put them on display for entertainment. It is the first serial since The War Games (1969) in which the Doctor is allowed to pilot the TARDIS completely under his own control. Plot The TARDIS misses Metebelis Three and materialises on the SS Bernice, a ship that suddenly disappeared while travelling the Indian Ocean. Being repeatedly arrested as stow-aways, the Third Doctor and Jo find out that ship's occupants keep repeating their actions, having no recollection of earlier encounters. The pair escape from the ship through a strange hatch plainly visible to them both but ignored by the crew and passengers. The Doctor and Jo venture through the circuitry of some sort of giant machine and arrive at marsh lands. They soon discover that they are not outside but are still inside the machine. Chased by Drashigs, huge swamp-dwelling carnivores, they escape back into the circuitry. Here, the Doctor realises that they have materialised inside the compression field of a Miniscope, a machine that keeps miniaturised groups of creatures in miniaturised versions of their natural environments. The Time Lords have banned such machines, but apparently one escaped. The Drashigs break into the circuitry and the Doctor and Jo flee back to the ship. They are separated in the confusion as the crew defend against the Drashigs. The events inside the miniscope are intercut with events involving its owners, travelling showman Vorg and his assistant Shirna, who have just arrived at the planet of Inter Minor but are suspected of being spies and refused entrance by a tribunal. The tribunal learns that objects removed from the machine soon return to their normal size when Vorg extracts a foreign object stuck in the circuitry ‚Äì actually the TARDIS ‚Äì from the machine. Two of the tribunal members, dissatisfied with the leadership of their planet, plot to let the Drashigs escape from the machine and allow them to wreak havoc, causing a crisis and the president's resignation. The Doctor eventually finds a way to the real outside and is restored to normal size. He cooperates with a reluctant Vorg to return into the machine by linking it with the TARDIS. After he goes back into the Scope, which is now overheating due to the Drashigs' damage, the device he attached is shot by a tribunal member and ceases to function, leaving the Doctor stranded. He finds Jo, but they collapse on the floor as the heat gets to be too much for them. Two Drashigs escape, but Vorg kills them by fixing the eradicator, sabotaged by the mutinous tribunal members. He fixes the Doctor's device, pushing the Phase Two switch which brings the Doctor and Jo back, just in time, and also returning all of the Scope's other occupants to their rightful space-time positions. As the penniless Vorg tries to get enough credit bars to return home by using the old three-magum-pods-and-a-yarrow-seed trick, the two travellers depart in the TARDIS. =Continuity= The aliens on display in Vorg's miniscope include: Drashigs, Ogrons and Cybermen. Production Working titles for this story included Peepshow. This story was recorded as part of the production block for the previous season but deliberately held over for Season Ten. This was to enable Barry Letts to direct the production, since his role as producer would have made it difficult to do so at the start of a production block (as he had found out with Terror of the Autons). The titles for Carnival of Monsters were prepared, like Frontier in Space, with a new arrangement of the theme music performed by Paddy Kingsland on a synthesizer. Known as the \\"Delaware\\" arrangement (the BBC Radiophonic Workshop was based on Delaware Road), it proved unpopular with BBC executives, so the original Delia Derbyshire theme was restored, and only appears on an uncorrected version of episode two that was shipped to Australia in error. This edit, which also featured a few extra scenes, was used in the 1995 VHS release. (The opening and closing title sequence versions of the theme have been included as an extra on the DVD release of the story. The original 2m 30sec theatrical release of this music was wiped many years ago.) The ship used was the RFA Robert Dundas which had been decommissioned and was scrapped immediately after filming. As the ship was actually in transit on its final voyage down the River Medway in Kent all external shots had to be filmed at a low angle or the banks of the estuary would have been visible.[Source DVD commentary] =Cast notes= Ian Marter later played the Fourth Doctor companion Harry Sullivan. He had previously auditioned for the role of Captain Mike Yates. Tenniel Evans was a long-time co-star of Jon Pertwee in The Navy Lark. Michael Wisher had already appeared twice in Third Doctor stories and provided Dalek voices in others, and would later be the first actor to portray Davros. Peter Halliday had appeared previously in the Second Doctor story The Invasion (1968). Both Cheryl Hall and Jenny McCracken were earlier considered for the part of companion Jo Grant. According to the DVD commentary for the 'Special Edition' of the story, they were on the final shortlist of six actresses seen for the role. Producer Barry Letts promised both actresses he'd use them in the future after offering the part of Grant to Katy Manning.Doctor Who: Carnival of Monsters (Special Edition) (DVD2012). BBC Warner. ASIN: B005SJGI90 Broadcast and reception When the serial was repeated on BBC2 in November 1981, daily, Monday-Thursday (16 November 1981 to 19 November 1981), at 5.40pm as part of \\"The Five Faces of Doctor Who\\", Barry Letts (then the series' Executive Producer) requested that the last few moments of episode 4 be edited to remove a shot where actor Peter Halliday's baldcap had slipped. The ratings for the repeats were 4.9, 4.5, 5.6 & 6.0 million viewers respectively. In 2010, Mark Braxton of Radio Times wrote that \\"the premise is ingenious\\" and \\"[furnished] with rich, imagination-kindling fare\\". He praised the guest cast, though he felt the Drashigs were a mixed bag. DVD Talk's John Sinnott gave the serial three and a half out of five stars, describing it as \\"light and fun\\" and praising the Miniscope and guest actor Leslie Dwyer. Neela Debnath of The Independent wrote that Carnival of Monsters had a \\"well-crafted plot that keeps the audience guessing for quite a while and this suspense serves as the driving force behind the serial\\". She felt that the Drashigs still worked because they were \\"such hideous-looking creatures\\". On the other hand, IGN reviewer Arnold T. Blumburg named the serial one of the worst of the Pertwee tenure, stating that it had \\"the most appalling character, set, and costume design in the era's history\\" and that some of the guest actors were wasted. In 2013, Den of Geeks Andrew Blair selected Carnival of Monsters as one of the ten Doctor Who stories that would make great musicals. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1977. =Home media= Carnival of Monsters was released on VHS in 1995. Episode 2 was an early edit with extra scenes and the \\"Delaware\\" arrangement of the theme tune. Episode 4 accidentally used the 1981 edit. This story was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2002, using the originally transmitted versions of episodes 2 and 4. It was released on DVD in the United States on 1 July 2003.

In the latter job, he helped to set up the England and Wales Longitudinal Survey, which monitors the health, address changes and fertility of a 1% sample of the population of England and Wales over time for statistical purposes. During 1980-8, he was Professor of Social Statistics at City University, building up his department into one of the world's leading centres for social statistics. He returned to OPCS in 1988 as the United Kingdom Chief Medical Statistician. In 1990, he took on the additional post of honorary professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. In 1996, following the creation of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) (into which OPCS was incorporated), cuts in the senior Civil Service meant that his responsibilities were widened to include demographic statistics and he became Director of the Census, Population and Health Group there. In 1999, he moved to the Department of Health as Director of Statistics. Due to further cuts in senior statistical posts in the Civil Service, he soon became the most senior government statistician outside the ONS. In 2004, he became the \\"Change Manager\\" responsible for setting up the new English Information Centre for Health and Social Care (since renamed the Health and Social Care Information Centre), which officially came into existence on 1 April 2005. This centre was an NHS special health authority, so he and his staff were part of the NHS. He was the Director of Customer and Stakeholder Engagement. The permanent Chief Executive from July 2005 is Professor Denise Lievesley, formerly director of Statistics at UNESCO. John has published several books on mortality and health statistics.

In July 2013, Chinese state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) acquired the aircraft Diesel engine designs and manufacturing assets of the former Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH and added them to the Continental Motors Group as Technify Motors GmbH. The 5,000th engine was delivered in April 2017 after 15 years of production, accumulating more than 5.25 million flying hours and equipping over 2,750 aircraft. History Thielert AG was a German financial holding company that has owned engine development and manufacturing companies. It was headquartered in Hamburg. Companies owned were Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH with sites in Lichtenstein, Saxony and Altenburg, Thuringia. Thielert AG was quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and was a member of the SDAX. Founded in 1989, turnover went from ‚Ç¨3.3M in 1997 to ‚Ç¨16.2M in 2002, while employees went from 27 to 112; Thielert Aircraft Engines was founded in 1999 to adapt Diesel engine for general aviation, entered Centurion 1.7 serial production in 2002 and had 86 employees in 2003. The main operating unit, Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH, declared insolvency on 24 April 2008 and was then run by an insolvency administrator, Bruno M. K√ºbler. The holding company, Thielert AG, also filed insolvency a week later on 30 April 2008 after the loss of its operational unit, Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH. The holding company ceased operations in autumn of 2008. It was sold in July 2013 to Continental Motors, a subsidiary of Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC). =Insolvency= On 6 March 2008 Thielert's financial statements for 2003, 2004 and 2005 were nullified by a Hamburg court, on the basis that the company had breached valuation provisions. As a result of these events the company's stock dropped to a record low of ‚Ç¨0.36 from previous highs of ‚Ç¨25.22 on the German stock market. On 23 April 2008 it was announced that the company Board of Directors had dismissed \\"with cause\\" company founder Frank Thielert and also cancelled his employment contract, due to evidence found during a criminal investigation by the Hamburg Office of Criminal Investigation. The allegations included that false invoices had been written, which were used to boost accounts receivable and create the appearance of a better financial position for the company. The board also dismissed Chief Financial Officer Roswitha Grosser and sold off ‚Ç¨24.4 million to cover immediate financial requirements. In April 2008 a stockholder restructuring plan was put on hold and as a result on 24 April 2008 Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH ‚Äî responsible for all engine production ‚Äî filed for insolvency at the Chemnitz County Court. As the situation deepened, the Thierlert board stated on 26 April 2008: \\"The going concern of Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH can only be ensured permanently by restructuring activities with the support of investors, due to the fact that the Holding Thielert AG is not capable to do so anymore.\\" The company announced that it would name a new executive board and an interim insolvency trustee. In April 2008 Cessna suspended plans to sell a Diesel- equipped Cessna 172TD as a result of the insolvency. On 1 May 2008 the board appointed a new CEO, lawyer Marcel Kleib and lawyer Achim Ahrendt of Hamburg was appointed to oversee the insolvency proceedings. On 5 May 2008 bankruptcy administrator attorney Bruno M. Kubler issued a letter to company customers indicating that the business would continue to operate producing engines and parts, meet existing orders, to preserve its capability to reorganize. On 14 May 2008 Thielert announced that it would no longer honour existing engine warranties for engines installed in Diamond Aircraft and also dramatically increased the price of parts. Owners who required warranty work were required to pay cash in advance for parts. This announcement caused an immediate negative reaction from Diamond DA42 owners and also from Diamond Aircraft. On 18 June 2008 the company announced that it was resuming production of all its Diesel engine products, with a production target of 80 units per month. Thielert guaranteed the new engines against defective materials and labor, but parts prices remained at the previously announced high levels.23 June edition, Aviation Week & Space Technology, page 29-30 On 10 July 2008 Diamond Aircraft announced that it was dropping out of the bidding to purchase Thielert, citing that Thielert withheld key information \\"vital to the due diligence process\\", although Thielert disagreed. On Friday 11 July 2008, Thielert issued a press release stating: \\"the reasons Diamond is presenting for its non-participation are clearly pretext\\". Thielert implied that Diamond was not a serious prospective buyer and that \\"Diamond's actions clearly serve the purpose of derogating Thielert's reputation in the naive assumption to be able to subsequently purchase Thielert far under value.\\" As part of its insolvency, Thielert indicated that it would not honor warranties or inspect and replace life-limited parts as was the case when the engines were sold to customers. This change in policy has resulted in Thielert-powered aircraft being grounded or no longer economically viable to fly. In November 2008 Diamond Aircraft CEO Peter Maurer said the insolvency commissioner responsible for Thielert's restructuring has come to understand that the eventual sale of the company will depend on product support. This led to Thielert reducing the cost of parts and actively working on extending inspection and replacement requirements for gearbox clutches as well as other parts. In January 2009, Bruno M. K√ºbler, Thielert's insolvency administrator announced that the company was, \\"in the black and working to capacity\\". On 6 April 2009 the company announced that insolvency administrator had \\"transferred the company's operative new business to a company that is unaffected by the insolvency proceedings\\". The new company, Centurion Engines, is responsible for worldwide sales of Centurion Diesel engines and spare parts. At the end of November 2010 the company was making a profit and actively seeking new investors. K√ºbler indicated that major lending institutions have loosened credit enough that investment is more likely than it was in 2008 or 2009. Frank Thielert was arrested and jailed in mid June 2013 as a flight risk, by a German bankruptcy court judge. In 2016 Thielert was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud in misrepresenting the value and financial position of the company during attempts to find buyers and investors.Vier Jahre Haft f√ºr den Thielert- Gr√ºnder, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 24. Februar 2016. On 23 July 2013 the company was sold to Continental Motors, Inc.. Continental is owned by AVIC International, which is, in turn, wholly owned by the Government of the People's Republic of China. Thielert was renamed Technify Motors GmbH. Continental uses Chinese investment to continue development of the company's products, with an emphasis on extending gearbox inspection periods initially.  Products  Thielert Aircraft Engines GmbH was well known as the manufacturer of the Centurion range of aircraft Diesel engines that run on jet fuel. Two engine models were built, the Centurion 2.0 with a power output of either 135 hp (101 kW) and the Centurion 2.0s with 155 hp (116 kW). The development of the third model, a 350 hp (261 kW) Centurion 4.0, was not completed. A fourth model, the 230 hp (172 kW) Centurion 3.2 was announced for 2008, but its final development was cancelled. Thielert Centurion 1.7 installed in a Cessna 172 Thielert Centurion 1.7 Diamond DA42 installation. New built aircraft equipped with Thielert Centurion engines include: * Diamond DA40 Diamond Star (Centurion 2.0) * Diamond DA42 Twin Star (Centurion 2.0) * Apex Aircraft's Robin DR400 135 CDI Ecoflyer (Centurion 2.0) * Cessna 172 Skyhawk TD (Centurion 2.0 S) ‚Äî Development suspended May 2008 Kits for the installation of retrofit Thielert engines exist for a number of aircraft, including the Piper PA-28 Cherokee and the Cessna 172 for the Centurion 2.0. A Thielert Centurion 2.0 engine also powers an unmanned aerial vehicle, the General Atomics Warrior, an upgraded version of the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator. A third field of activity is contract engine development and manufacture of engine parts for prototypes and small series for the automotive industry.

During his reign, Georgia went into further decline under the Mongol overlordship. Early life and diarchy David was a son of King Giorgi IV Lasha by a non-noble woman. Fearing that he would pretend to the throne, his aunt, Queen Rusudan held him prisoner at the court of her son-in-law, the sultan Kaykhusraw II for nearly seven years, and sent her son David to the Mongol court to get his official recognition as heir apparent. Following Kaykhusraw‚Äôs defeat by the Mongols, David, son of Giorgi, was set free in 1242. In 1246, he was selected as king by the Georgian nobles who believed that his cousin David VI, son of Rusudan, had died in 1244. Following the coronation at Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, Mtskheta, he was sent to the Great Khan G√ºy√ºk Khan to receive an official recognition. Held at Karakorum for five years, he met his cousin David there. Finally, G√ºy√ºk Khan recognized David (Lasha Giorgi‚Äôs son) as senior joint sovereign and appointed another David (Rusudan‚Äôs son) junior co-ruler. Thereafter known as David VII Ulu (i.e. \\"the senior\\") and David VI Narin (i.e. \\"the junior\\"), the cousins ruled jointly for years. Decline of the kingdom In 1256, David Ulu with the Georgian auxiliaries took part in Mongol conquest of Alamut. In 1259, David Narin rose, unsuccessfully, against the Mongol yoke and, then, fled to Kutaisi, whence he reigned over western Georgia (Imereti) as an independent ruler. In 1260, Hulagu Khan requested that David Ulu supported him in the war against Egypt. David, remembering the Georgian losses at Baghdad (1258) refused to comply and revolted. A huge army of Mongols led by Arghun Noyan attacked the southern Georgian province of Samtskhe, defeated the king and his spasalar (general) Sargis Jakeli of Samtskhe, but could not capture the rebels‚Äô main strongholds and left the country in June 1261. Nevertheless, the forces were unequal and David Ulu had to take refuge at his cousin, David VI Narin‚Äôs court at Kutaisi. His family was captured and David‚Äôs wife Gvantsa killed by the Mongols. In 1262, he had to make peace with the Mongols and returned to Tbilisi, effectively splitting the country into two parts with both rulers titled as kings of Georgia.  Later life  By the Ilkhan request, David Ulu‚Äôs army was dispatched to defend the fortifications of Siba against the Golden Horde in 1263. In 1265, the Georgian forces serving as a vanguard of the Ilkhanid army, defeated Berke, Khan of the Golden Horde, and expelled his troops from Shirvan. A heavy burden of Mongol dominance led to a political and economic crisis in the kingdom. As a result of a dispute with the royal court, the province of Samtskhe seceded and submitted directly to the Ilkhan rule in 1266. Thus, Georgia further disintegrated to form three separate political entities. David VII Ulu died of a bowel infection at the age of 55 in the spring of 1270. He was buried at Mtskheta. He was succeeded by his son Demetre II. Marriage and children He was married four times. His first wife, Jigda-Khatun, either a Mongol woman or a daughter of the Sultan of Rum, died in 1252. In the meantime (1249/50), he bigamously contracted a union with an Alan woman, Altun, whom he repudiated in 1252. His third wife Gvantsa, widow of the Georgian noble Avag Mkhargrdzeli and daughter of Kakhaber, eristavi (duke) of Racha and Takveri, was executed on the orders of Hulagu Khan in 1262. In 1263, David married Esukan, daughter of the Mongol noyan Chormaqan. He had two sons and two daughters, including: *Giorgi (1250‚Äì1268) (by Altun), heir apparent, died before his father‚Äôs death in 1268, *Tamar (by Altun) was married twice: a son of Arghun noyan in c. 1273, and later the Georgian noble Sadun of Mankaberdi, regent of the kingdom in 1269-1278. *Demetre (by Gvantsa) succeeded him in 1270.

It was formed under the mandate of the 1987 Indo-Sri Lankan Accord that aimed to end the Sri Lankan Civil War between Sri Lankan Tamil nationalists such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the Sri Lankan military. The main task of the IPKF was to disarm the different militant groups, not just the LTTE. It was to be quickly followed by the formation of an Interim Administrative Council. These were the tasks as per the terms of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, signed at the behest of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Given the escalation of the conflict in Sri Lanka, and with the pouring of refugees into India, Gandhi took the decisive step to push this accord through. The IPKF was inducted into Sri Lanka on the request of Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene under the terms of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. The force was initially not expected to be involved in any significant combat by the Indian High Command. However, within a few months, the IPKF became embroiled in battle with the LTTE to enforce peace. The differences started with LTTE trying to dominate the Interim Administrative Council, and also refusing to disarm, which was a pre-condition to enforce peace in the island. Soon, these differences led to the LTTE attacking the IPKF, at which point the IPKF decided to disarm the LTTE militants, by force if required. In the two years it was in northern Sri Lanka, the IPKF launched a number of combat operations aimed at destroying the LTTE-led insurgency. It soon escalated into repeated skirmishes between the IPKF and LTTE. The IPKF began withdrawing from Sri Lanka in 1989, on the orders of the newly elected Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa and following the election of the V. P. Singh government in India. The last IPKF contingents left Sri Lanka in March 1990. India's battle in Sri Lanka is often compared and called as 'India's Vietnam' by International Media. Background Sri Lanka, from the early 1980s, was facing increasingly violent ethnic strife in the Sri Lankan Civil War. The origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War can be traced to the independence of Sri Lanka in 1948, after the end of British rule. At the time, a Sinhalese majority government was instituted. This government, which included the Tamil Congress, passed legislation deemed discriminatory by some against the Tamil minority in Sri Lanka. In the 1970s, two major Tamil parties, the Tamil Congress and a split, the Federal Party united to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF), a separatist Tamil nationalist group that agitated for a separate state of Tamil Eelam in north and eastern Sri Lanka that would grant the Tamils greater autonomy within the federal structure. However, the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of Sri Lanka, enacted in August 1983, classified all separatist movements as unconstitutional,The Peace Accord and the Tamils in Sri Lanka.Hennayake S.K. Asian Survey, Vol. 29, No. 4. (Apr. 1989), pp. 401‚Äì415. Outside the TULF, Tamil factions advocating more militant courses of action soon emerged, and the ethnic divisions eventually led to violent civil war. =Indian involvement and intervention= Initially, under Indira GandhiIndia's search for power:Indira Gandhi's Foreign Policy.1966‚Äì1982. Mansingh S. New Delhi:Sage 1984. p282 and later under Rajiv Gandhi, the Indian Government sympathised with the Tamil insurrection in Sri Lanka because of the strong support for the Tamil cause within the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Emboldened by this support, supporters in Tamil Nadu provided a sanctuary for the separatists and helped the LTTE smuggle arms and ammunition into Sri Lanka, making them the strongest force on the island. In fact in 1982, the LTTE supremo Prabhakran was arrested by the police in Tamil Nadu, for a shoot-out with his rival Uma Maheswaran, in the middle of the city. Both of them were arrested and later released by the police. This activity was left unchecked as India's regional and domestic interests wanted to limit foreign intervention on what was deemed as an ethnic issue between the Tamils and the Sinhalese. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan president Junius Richard Jayewardene that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if diplomatic solutions should fail.India's Regional Security Doctrine. Hagerty D.T. Asian Survey, Vol. 31, No. 4. (Apr. 1991), pp. 351‚Äì363 The first round of civil violence flared in 1983 when the killing of 13 soldiers of the Sri Lanka Army, sparked anti-Tamil pogroms‚Äîthe Black July riots‚Äîin which approximately 400 Tamils were killed. The riots only aided in the deterioration of the ethnic relations. Militant factions, including the LTTE, at this time recruited in large numbers and continued building on popular Tamil dissent and stepped up the guerrilla war. By May 1985, the guerrillas were strong enough to launch an attack on Anuradhapura, attacking the Bodhi Tree shrine‚Äìa sacred site for Buddhist Sinhalese‚Äìfollowed by a rampage through the town. At least 150 civilians died in the hour-long attack. Gandhi's government attempted to re-establish friendly relations with the various factions in Sri Lanka while maintaining diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the conflict as well as limiting overt aid to the Tamil fighters. The Sri Lankan government, deducing a decline in support for the Tamil rebels from India, began rearming itself extensively for its anti-insurgent role with support from Pakistan, Israel, Singapore, and South Africa.The Colombo Chill. Bobb D. India Today. 31 March 1986. p. 95. In 1986, the campaign against the insurgency was stepped up. In 1987, retaliating against an increasingly bloody insurgent movement, the Vadamarachchi Operation (Operation Liberation) was launched against LTTE strongholds in Jaffna Peninsula. The operation involved nearly 4,000 troops, supported by helicopter gunships as well as ground-attack aircraft. In June 1987, the Sri Lankan Army laid siege on the town of Jaffna.India Airlifts Aid to Tamil Rebels\\", The New York Times. 5 June 1987 This resulted in large-scale civilian casualties and created a condition of humanitarian crisis.\\"Operation Poomalai ‚Äì India Intervenes\\" Bharat-rakshak.com India, which had a substantial Tamil population in South India faced the prospect of a Tamil backlash at home, called on the Sri Lankan government to halt the offensive in an attempt to negotiate a political settlement. However, the Indian efforts were unheeded. Added to this, in the growing involvement of Pakistani advisers, it was necessary for Indian interest to mount a show of force. Failing to negotiate an end to the crisis with Sri Lanka, India announced on 2 June 1987 that it wound send a convoy of unarmed ships to northern Sri Lanka to provide humanitarian assistance\\"Indians To Send convoy to Sri Lanka\\", The New York Times. 2 June 1987 but this was intercepted by the Sri Lankan Navy and forced to turned back.\\"Indian Flotilla is turned back by Sri Lankan Naval Vessels,\\" The New York Times. 4 June 1987 Following the failure of the naval mission the decision was made by the Indian government to mount an airdrop of relief supplies in aid of the beleaguered civilians over the besieged city of Jaffna. On 4 June 1987, in a bid to provide relief, the Indian Air Force mounted Operation Poomalai. Five Antonov An-32s under fighter cover flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi, Bernard Tilakaratna, was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the Minister of State, External Affairs, K. Natwar Singh, of the ongoing operation and also indicated that the operation was expected not to be hindered by the Sri Lankan Air Force. The ultimate aim of the operation was both to demonstrate the seriousness of the domestic Tamil concern for the civilian Tamil population and reaffirming the Indian option of active intervention to the Sri Lankan government. =Indo-Sri Lanka Accord= Following Operation Poomalai, faced with the possibility of an active Indian intervention and lacking any possible ally, the President, J. R. Jayewardene, offered to hold talks with the Rajiv Gandhi government on future moves. The siege of Jaffna was soon lifted, followed by a round of negotiations that led to the signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord on 29 July 1987 that brought a temporary truce. Crucially however, the negotiations did not include the LTTE as a party to the talks. The signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord on 29 July 1987 brought a temporary truce to the Sri Lankan Civil War. Under the terms of the agreement, Colombo agreed to a devolution of power to the provinces, the Sri Lankan troops were withdrawn to their barracks in the north, the Tamil rebels were to disarm. Mandate Amongst the provisions undersigned by the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord was the commitment of Indian military assistance should this be requested for by the Sri Lankan Government, as well as the provision of an Indian Peace Keeping Force that would \\"guarantee and enforce the cessation of hostilities\\". It was on these grounds, and on the request of President J. R. Jayewardene, that Indian troops were inducted to Northern Sri Lanka. J N Dixit, the then Indian ambassador to Colombo, in an interview to rediff.com in 2000 described that ostensibly, Jayawardene's decision to request Indian assistance came in the face of increasing civil riots and violence within the southern Sinhalese majority areas, including the capital Colombo that were initiated by the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that necessitated the withdrawal of the Sri Lankan Army from the Tamil areas of northern Sri Lanka to maintain order. Order of battle Originally a reinforced division with small naval and air elements, the IPKF at its peak deployed four divisions and nearly 80,000 men with one mountain (4th) and three Infantry Divisions (36th, 54th, 57th) as well as supporting arms and services. At the peak of its operational deployment, IPKF operations also included a large Indian Paramilitary Force and Indian Special Forces elements. Indeed, Sri Lanka was first theatre of active operation for the Indian Navy Commandos. The main deployment of the IPKF was in northern and eastern Sri Lanka. Upon its withdrawal from Sri Lanka the IPKF was renamed the 21st Corps and was headquartered near Bhopal and became a quick reaction force for the Indian Army. =Indian Army= The first Indian Army troops to be inducted into Sri Lanka were a ten thousand strong force from the 54th Infantry Division commanded by Major General Harkirat Singh, which flew into Palali Airbase from 30 July onwards. This was followed later by the 36th Infantry Division. By 1987, the IPKF consisted of: * 54th Infantry Division ** 10th Battalion, Parachute Regiment (Special Forces) ** 65 Armoured Regiment ** 6th Battalion, Brigade of the Guards ** 91 Infantry Brigade *** 5th Battalion, Madras Regiment *** 8th Battalion, Mahar Regiment *** 1st Battalion, Maratha Light Infantry ** 76 Infantry Brigade *** 12th Battalion, Garhwal Rifle *** 2nd Battalion, Maratha Light Infantry *** 25th Battalion, Rajput Regiment ** 47 Infantry Brigade *** 11th Battalion, Madras Regiment *** 5th Battalion, Maratha Light Infantry *** 14th Battalion, Sikh Light Infantry * 36 Infantry Division ** 115 Infantry Brigade *** 5th Battalion, 1 Gorkha Rifles ** 72 Infantry Brigade *** 4th Battalion, 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force). *** 13th Battalion, Sikh Light Infantry ** 41 Infantry Brigade *** 5th Battalion, Rajputana Rifles * 57th Infantry Division * 4th Mountain Division * Independent Units ** 340 Independent Infantry Brigade (Amphibious) ** 18 Infantry Brigade *** 4th Battalion, Mahar Regiment *** 12th Battalion, Grenadiers ** 5th Battalion, Parachute Regiment *** 15th Battalion Mechanised Infantry Regiment *** 25th Battalion Mechanised Infantry Regiment *** 17 Parachute Field Regiment *** 831 Light Regiment *** 8 Engineer Regiment *** 110 Engineer Regiment =Indian Air Force= Soon after its intervention in Sri Lanka and especially after the confrontation with the LTTE, the IPKF received a substantial commitment from the Indian Air Force, mainly transport and helicopter squadrons under the command of Gp.Capt. M.P Premi, including: The Indian Air Force in Sri Lanka * No. 33 Squadron- Antonov An-32s * No 109 and No. 119 Helicopter Units ‚Äì Mil Mi-8 helicopters. * No. 125 HU ‚Äì Mil Mi-24s. * No. 664 AOP Squadron Chetak and Cheetah =Indian Navy= The Indian Navy regularly rotated naval vessels through Sri Lanka waters, mostly smaller vessels such as patrol boats. * Indian Naval Air Arm ** No. 321 Squadron of the Indian Navy- HAL Chetaks ** No. 310 Squadron of the Indian Navy- Breguet Aliz√© * MARCOS (also the Marine Commando Force or MCF) ‚Äì Took part in Operation Pawan (Hindi, \\"wind\\") in 1987 and in the raid on an LTTE base at Guru Nagar. MARCOS operators (including Lt Singh) boarded two Gemini rafts off the coast of Jaffna City and towed two wooden rafts of explosives into a channel leading to the city's Guru Nagar Jetty. Avoiding mines, eight men and two officers shifted to the wooden rafts and paddled to the jetty then fixed demolition charges to the jetty and LTTE speedboats. The commandos were detected but laid down suppressive fire and detonated the explosives before retreating to the Geminis without taking casualties. Two nights later, commandos swam back into the harbour amidst heavy patrolling by the LTTE to destroy the remaining speedboats. They were again detected and sustained minor injuries. These actions helped recapture Trincomalee and Jaffna harbours from the LTTE. For leading these actions the 30-year-old Lt. Singh Arvind Singh became the youngest officer to receive the Maha Vir Chakra Award. =Indian paramilitary forces= * Central Reserve Police Force * Indian Coast Guard Combat operations Analysis =Casualties= In December 1999, Defence Minister George Fernandes disclosed the IPKF had suffered 1,165 personnel killed in action with 3,009 others wounded. The LTTE casualties are not known. =Intelligence Failures= The Indian intelligence agencies failed to consistently provide accurate information to the forces. One example is the Jaffna football ground massacre. The LTTE's disinformation machinery leaked fake information to the Indian army that the LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran was hiding in a building near the Jaffna university football ground. A major operational plan was chalked out by the Indian generals to capture him alive. The plan involved airdropping commandos on the ground, while tank formations would move to surround the area, to prevent anyone from the stadium and its surrounding buildings to escape. However, when the plan was executed, the Indian troops came under heavy attack from hidden LTTE sharpshooters. the tanks moving on the ground were ensnared by anti-tank mines placed by the LTTE fighters. This resulted in heavy losses for the Indian side.citation needed According to later accounts, the LTTE leader, Prabhakaran was not in the area at the time of the operation. The IPKF complained that accurate maps of the operational theaters were not made available to them by the various intelligence agencies. There was also a case where an agent of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) was killed in an ambush set up by the IPKF. He had been acting on orders to carry out back channel diplomacy and peacetalks with the LTTE. Impact The IPKF mission while having gained tactical successes, did not succeed in its intended goals. On 21 May 1991, the LTTE assassinated Rajiv Gandhi for his role in sending the IPKF to Sri Lanka. The primary impact of the IPKF, has been that it shaped India's counter- insurgency techniques and military doctrine. On the international scene, it does not find significant mention in National or International military history. The political fallout, the IPKF's casualties, as well as the deterioration of international relations has however shaped India's foreign policy towards the Sri Lankan conflict. (see below) =Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi= The decision to send the IPKF in Sri Lanka was taken by then prime- minister of India, Rajiv Gandhi, who held office until 1989. Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated at a rally at Sriperumbudur on 21 May 1991, while he was campaigning for re-election during the 1991 Indian General Election, by a suicide bomber, who was a member of the LTTE, named Dhanu. =India's foreign policy= The debacle that was IPKF's intervention in Sri Lanka is raised at times in Indian political discourse whenever the situation in Sri Lanka shows signs of deteriorating, and there is a question of intervening; or, in Sri Lankan politics (particularly by the LTTE), when it is proposed that India, or, more broadly, other foreigners, ought to have a role in promoting peace on the island nation. As a result, relations between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India vowed never to offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no defence pact has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been directly involved in the peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts. Controversies The IPKF's role in the Sri Lankan conflict was criticized by voices both there and at home at the time. It was engaged in a number of incidents of human rights violation, including rapes and massacre of civilians. Even some neutral organisations pointed out that Indian Army engaged with scant regard for civilian safety and violated human rights. This led to considerable outcry and public resentment within Sri Lanka as well as India, especially in Tamil Nadu, where the IPKF was viewed as an invading and oppressing force. Indian forces indulged in a number of civilian massacres, Involuntary disappearances and rapes during their time in the Northeastern province of Sri Lanka. p.181 These include complicity in the incidents such as Valvettiturai massacre in which on 2, 3, and 4 August 1989 over 50 Tamils were massacred by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Valvettiturai, Jaffna. In addition to the killings over 100 homes, shops and other property were also burnt and destroyed. Another notable incident was the Jaffna teaching hospital massacre on 22 October 1987, following a confrontation with Tamil militants near the hospital, IPKF quickly entered the hospital premises and massacred over 70 civilians. These civilians included patients, two doctors, three nurses and a paediatric consultant who were all in uniform. The hospital never completely recovered after this massacre. p.246 p.546 The IPKF was also accused of complicity in murder of Sinhalese civilians in the 1987 Trincomalee massacre where according to Asian Times in August 1987, a number of majority Sinhalese civilians were massacred. The then Sri Lankan government accused the Madras Regiment posted in the Trincomalee district of complicity, although the Indian officials denied responsibility, they withdrew the Madras Regiment from Trincomalee district. War Memorial The Sri Lankan government had mooted the idea of a war memorial to those soldiers of the IPKF who lost their lives during the peacekeeping mission, in the early Nineties during President Premadasa's rule. The memorial was finally constructed in Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte on the outskirts of Colombo in 2008. The names of the 1200 soldiers who died are inscribed on black marble. The first official memorial service was held on 15 August 2010 when the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Shri Ashok Kantha laid a wreath to honour the dead. The absence of a representative of the Sri Lankan government has been criticised by Indian ex-servicemen who had served in the conflict.. At IPKF Memorial, India finally pays homage. Hindustan Times, 15 Aug 2010, Colombo. Retrieved 17 August 2010. A renovated memorial for IPKF soldiers in Palaly, Jaffna, has been declared open in June 2015. The names of 33 who died in the operations in the Northern Province during 1987‚Äì1990 have been inscribed on a wall at the memorial site.\\"Renovated memorial for IPKF soldiers\\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/renovated-memorial-for- ipkf-soldiers/article7298952.ece See also Annai Poopathy * Black July * Hunger strike of LTC Thileepan * India-Sri Lanka Accord * Jaffna hospital massacre * Jaffna University Helidrop * Operation Pawan * Operation Poomalai * State terrorism in Sri Lanka * Valvettiturai massacre (1989) * References =Notes and Further reading= * Dixit, J.

It is located in Troms√∏, in northern Norway. Rather than a mainly scientific aquarium such as the one in Bergen in the Norwegian midlands, Polaria, which opened in May 1998, is designed to be an educational experience, with particular emphasis on displays for children. Most of the displays focus on the northerly islands of Svalbard. There is a five-screen panoramic cinema, an \\"Arctic Walkway\\" area containing displays of polar exploration equipment, stuffed animals and simulated permafrost, many conventional aquaria displaying local marine life as well as open tanks and display tanks containing rock- shore animals, baby fish and other child-friendly exhibits. Its centerpiece is an open pool containing a group of bearded seals, Erignathus barbatus. These are trained and there are regular displays, as much to keep the animals active and healthy as for public entertainment. The seal enclosure has observation blisters set into its sides, so that visitors can look up at the animals from underneath, and a submerged walkway in a transparent tunnel across the bottom, allowing close access to the animals in their natural environment. The building itself is also worthy of note. Its striking design represents ice floes that have been pressed up on land by the rough seas of the Arctic. This attractive piece of modern architecture echoes the Arctic Cathedral across the harbour in Tromsdalen on the mainland.

Aldridge is noted for his work with numerous bands and artists since the 1970s, such as Black Oak Arkansas, Pat Travers Band, Ozzy Osbourne, Gary Moore, Whitesnake, Ted Nugent, Thin Lizzy, Vinnie Moore and Yngwie Malmsteen. Self-taught, Aldridge was initially inspired by the music of Cream, the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin. Drummers such as Joe Morello, Ginger Baker, John Bonham and Mitch Mitchell were particularly influential as Aldridge developed his drumming style. Aldridge himself has become very influential, and is regarded as a double bass drum pioneer in rock music. Career Raised in Florida in a non-musical family, Aldridge taught himself to play drums in the 1960s, building a kit piece by piece with money earned delivering newspapers and other odd jobs. He credits his unique style to learning without the benefit of a mentor or teacher. While his mother was supportive of his desire to play music, his father was an alcoholic who didn't view musicians favorably. As a result, while practicing in an outbuilding in his backyard Aldridge would often place towels over his drum heads to prevent his father from hearing. In the early 1970s, Aldridge began playing original music with Alley Keith in the Florida Panhandle. Inspired by drummers such as Louis Bellson and Sam Woodyard, he started using a double-bass drum setup and became an early pioneer of the hard rock double kick drum style of drumming. After playing for a short time with the southern rock band David and the Giants in 1972, Aldridge auditioned for Black Oak Arkansas and was surprised to get the job. He made his recording debut in 1972 with Black Oak Arkansas' If an Angel Came to See You, Would You Make Her Feel at Home? album. He subsequently recorded several albums with the band between 1972 and 1976 and toured extensively. Aldridge has said that he wasn't particularly fond of Black Oak Arkansas' music and his intention when joining the band was to use the opportunity as a springboard to make a name for himself in the industry, something he says he's not particularly proud of in hindsight. Not happy with the band's heavy use of hashish, Aldridge attempted to leave Black Oak Arkansas. As the band's management wasn't keen on giving him his contractual freedom, Aldridge was forced to sneak away in the middle of the night and subsequently \\"hide out in Chicago\\". During that period he played with a local band called \\"d'Thumbs\\". One and a half years of lawsuits ensued, after which he was contractually free to record again. Aldridge spent 1978 to 1981 with the Pat Travers Band, recording five albums over that time. Upon parting ways with Travers in 1981, Aldridge moved to London, England and began working with Gary Moore, recording the Dirty Fingers album. American guitarist Randy Rhoads, who had recently arrived in England to record with Ozzy Osbourne, was a big fan of Moore's guitar playing, and one day he and Bob Daisley arrived to watch Moore's band rehearse. Aldridge and Rhoads became friends immediately. Aldridge had known Osbourne for several years, as Black Oak Arkansas had toured with Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath extensively in the 1970s, and Aldridge's new friendship with Rhoads would lead him to join Osbourne's band a few months later. Although Aldridge is credited in the liner notes and pictured on the inner sleeve of Osbourne's 1981 album Diary of a Madman, Lee Kerslake actually performed all the drum parts on the original release. Aldridge has stated that working with Rhoads in Osbourne's band was one of the \\"musical highlights\\" of his life.Tommy Aldridge Interview by Travis Marc of UK Drummer http://ukdrummer.com/2013/03/tommy-aldridge-interview/ Rhoads stated of Aldridge in late 1981 that \\"he was always my favorite drummer\\", stating that he was \\"knocked out\\" by the drummer after seeing him perform with Black Oak Arkansas on television in the 1970s. Aldridge appeared on Osbourne's Bark at the Moon album in 1983 as well as a pair of live albums (Speak of the Devil and Tribute) before leaving the band in 1984. Soon after, Aldridge, along with bassist and former Ozzy Osbourne-bandmate Rudy Sarzo, joined forces with guitar/keyboard player Tony MacAlpine and vocalist Rob Rock to form a short- lived project called M.A.R.S.. Close friends, Aldridge and Sarzo both joined Whitesnake in 1987 as the band prepared to tour in support of its multi- platinum selling Whitesnake album. Aldridge and Sarzo performed on the band's follow-up album, Slip of the Tongue, released in 1989. Announcing he was going to take a break from the music industry, Whitesnake frontman David Coverdale put the band on indefinite hiatus after the tour, and Aldridge moved on. Following his stint in Whitesnake, Aldridge played in the band Manic Eden, with his former Whitesnake bandmates Adrian Vandenberg and Sarzo. The line-up also included former Little Caesar vocalist Ron Young. During the 1990s Aldridge recorded and toured with various acts including Mot√∂rhead, House of Lords, Yngwie Malmsteen, John Sykes, and Ted Nugent. Aldridge has been an in- demand drum clinician since the early 1980s, and much of his work involves drum clinics and festivals each year. From 2002 Aldridge toured with Whitesnake alongside David Coverdale (vocals), Doug Aldrich (guitar), Reb Beach (guitar), Marco Mendoza/Uriah Duffy (bass) and Timothy Drury (keyboards). Aldridge left Whitesnake in 2007 to pursue alternate musical endeavours.Chris Frazier interview ‚Äì New drummer Chris Frazier interviewed on Whitesnake.com From 2007 to 2009, Aldridge was touring with Thin Lizzy alongside Scott Gorham, John Sykes and Marco Mendoza. Thin Lizzy, along with The Answer, were scheduled to support AC/DC at stadium shows in England, Ireland and Scotland at the end of June 2009 but these appearances were canceled after Aldridge broke his collarbone in an accident. On June 30, it was announced that Sykes had left Thin Lizzy and all shows for the rest of 2009 were canceled or postponed. Gorham stated that he would announce the band's future plans shortly. In May 2010, Thin Lizzy did not include Aldridge in the new line-up due to him still recovering from his injury. Original Thin Lizzy drummer Brian Downey returned to the band. On January 25, 2013, it was announced that Aldridge had rejoined Whitesnake for the third time for the band's upcoming \\"Year of the Snake\\" tour. He has since recorded the albums Flesh & Blood and The Purple Album with the group and remains their drummer as of January 2020. Equipment Aldridge plays Yamaha drums, a company he has been with since 1982 and currently uses Absolute Maple Nouveau series drums from Yamaha. His kick drum pedals are fitted with Danmar 207A Tommy Aldridge pedal beaters. Aldridge has been a Paiste Artist since January 2003. He uses Remo drum heads and signature ProMark drum sticks. Yamaha has made Aldridge a custom \\"soon to be released\\" Signature Snare drum that is a 7x14 stainless steel model with die cast hoops and black chrome hardware. He also endorses Paiste cymbals. His cymbal selection can vary, but he prefers their 2002, Signature and RUDE cymbals.Tommy's Weapons of Choice Tommy's official website Discography =Black Oak Arkansas= * If an Angel Came to See You... * Street Party * Ain't Life Grand * X-Rated * Balls of Fire * High on the Hog * King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Black Oak Arkansas * Raunch 'N' Roll Live * Live!

It was the last regular appearance of Katy Manning as companion Jo Grant. In the serial, the alien time traveller the Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and the organisation UNIT investigate a South Wales mine where waste from an oil plant has killed miners and made maggots grow to giant size. Plot The Third Doctor is making adjustments to the TARDIS' coordinate programmer in preparation for a visit to Metebelis Three, when Jo reads in a newspaper about the mysterious death of a miner named Hughes in the abandoned coal mine in Llanfairfach in South Wales. The miner was found dead and glowing bright green. Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and Jo go down to investigate the miner's death. The Doctor agrees to follow the Brigadier, but is determined to go to Metebelis Three first. The Brigadier's first port of call is the recently opened Global Chemicals oil plant, close to the abandoned mine. Its headman, Stevens, claims that the plant can \\"produce 25% more petrol and diesel fuel from a given quantity of crude oil\\"‚Äîbut that the 'Stevens process' only produces a minimal amount of waste. Jones is convinced that the oil-making process must create thousands of gallons of waste. He also believes that there is a link between Global Chemicals and Hughes' death‚Äîbut his research is too demanding for him to go down the mine and investigate. Jo heads for the mineshaft. The Doctor reaches Metebelis Three, but it is far from the \\"blue paradise\\" he described. He is attacked by various unseen creatures, and returns to the UNIT laboratory with only a small blue crystal to show for his misadventure. He then drives down to South Wales in his car, Bessie, and meets the Brigadier at Global Chemicals. They then set off to go down the mine to investigate, despite Stevens' insistence that it should be sealed. Stevens summons his henchman, Hinks, and tells him in a strange emotionless voice \\"nobody must go down the mine\\". Hinks leaves and Stevens dons a pair of strange headphones. Jo has arrived at the pithead ahead of the Doctor and the Brigadier, and gone down the shaft with a miner called Bert to help another man, Dai Evans, who has called for help at the bottom of the mine. When the Doctor and the Brigadier arrive, Dave, the man controlling the cage's descent, finds that the brake has been sabotaged. The Doctor slows the cage's descent, but his efforts leave Jo and Bert trapped at the bottom of the shaft. There, they find Dai, who is turning bright green and dying. Bert remembers there is an emergency shaft out of the mine, and he and Jo set off. The Doctor suggests cutting the mineshaft cables and linking it up to a donkey engine, which would enable him to use the second cage to get down the mine. The Brigadier goes to Global Chemicals to request some cutting equipment, but a man named Fell informs him that they do not have such equipment. The Doctor has Professor Jones and his environmentalist friends create a demonstration at the Global Chemicals gate, while he slips in, in an attempt to steal the equipment. However, he is captured. Fortunately, Dave and the Brigadier, while on their way to get cutting equipment, stopped at a petrol station and found a man using the required equipment to cut up an old car. They borrow this, free the secondary mine cage, and the Doctor goes down the shaft with Dave and two other miners. They find Dai now dead and a note from Jo telling them that she and Bert have headed for the emergency shaft. Jo and Bert have made good progress through the old mine tunnels, when they find a green slime trickling down the wall. When Bert touches this, he begins to grow weak, and his hand starts to turn bright green. At Bert's insistence, Jo goes on without him. Dave and the Doctor find Bert, and the Doctor goes on to find Jo. By the time they reunite, Jo has found a vast lake of bright green slime, filled with huge maggot creatures. When the tunnel collapses behind them, they use an old mining wagon to get across the green lake. They then climb a steep shaft, where the Doctor collects a huge egg to take back for experimentation. At the top of the natural shaft, they find a large pipe, with the insides covered with traces of crude oil waste‚Äîmeaning that the pipe leads to the Global Chemicals plant. In the plant, a worker named Elgin, an old friend of Fell, tells him about Dai's death and the dying Bert. Elgin later follows Fell into a pumping control room, where Fell is pumping the oil waste from the main tank on level four into another tank. The security system then registers the Doctor and Jo's presence in the pipe. Fell, who has actually arranged for the waste to be pumped down the pipe into the abandoned mine workings, is initially reluctant to rescue the two in the pipe. Elgin convinces Fell to help him open the hatch, and the Doctor and Jo escape as the oil waste cascades down the pipe. Fell goes to see Stevens, complaining about a 'headache', and Stevens puts the headphones on Fell. A voice tells Stevens that 'Fell's 'processing' was a failure' and orders self-destruction. After Stevens presses a button on a control panel, Fell leaves the room and jumps off a balcony to his death. The Doctor, Jo and the Brigadier end the day with a meal of fungus at Jones' retreat the \\"Nuthutch\\", but the frivolity is cut short when they hear Bert too has died. After everyone retires to bed the egg the Doctor brought back from the mine hatches out into a giant maggot. Escaping from the lab where the egg was left, the maggot first heads for Jo, but then jumps on and bites Hinks, sent to the Nuthutch by Stevens to steal the egg. The maggot escapes from the house into the dark, and Hinks quickly weakens as the poisonous \\"green death\\" infection spreads through his body. The next morning, the Brigadier has the UNIT troops lay explosives and detonate the whole mine pithead, to the Doctor's fury. This fails to trap the maggots in the mine, as they begin to emerge; first, attempting to escape up the Global Chemicals waste disposal pipe, then burrowing through the slagheap near the mine. At Global Chemicals, Mike Yates has been sent in undercover by the Brigadier, and is contacted by the Doctor, who dons some improbable disguises in order to get through the gates and move freely. Having liaised with Yates, the Doctor learns that Stevens take his instructions from someone on the top floor of the complex, and heads up there in the special lift to find out who is in charge. He finds that this is the home of the BOSS, a supercomputer with its own megalomaniac personality. It runs the company, controls Stevens and other key staff members, and is responsible for the polluting chemical process. The Doctor rejects the brainwashing technique that Stevens and the BOSS subject him to ‚Äì but Yates is more susceptible and is converted into one of the computer's slaves. After the Doctor escapes, Yates is sent to the Nuthutch to kill the Doctor. His conditioning is deep, and is only broken by the Doctor's use of the blue crystal he brought from Metebelis Three. Jo has alienated Jones, with whom she is falling in love, by ruining one of his experimenting slides of green slime. Determined to make amends, she heads to the slagheap in search of a maggot to run some tests on. Meanwhile, Jones finds that the fungus powder Jo spilt on the slides is actually a cure for the 'green death' infection. He races to the slag heap to find Jo surrounded by giant maggots, and they are both caught in an RAF bombing raid on the maggots. Jones is infected with the 'green death' and begins to turn green ‚Äî and all before he was able to share his knowledge of the cure. Jo contacts her UNIT friends with her radio, and the Doctor and Sergeant Benton rescue the two from the maggots in Bessie. Hearing Jones utter the word \\"Serendipity\\", the Doctor realises that Jones might have stumbled upon something that could combat the maggots and their infection. Benton arrives with a maggot chrysalis‚Äîproof that the maggots are beginning to transform into mature giant insects. Then, the maggot that escaped from the laboratory is found on the table‚Äîdead. Realising that the creature died from eating some of the fungus, the Doctor also discovers the cure for Jones. The Doctor and Benton drive around the slag heaps, scattering the fungus, which proves deadly to the maggots. They are then attacked by a giant fly creature‚Äîthe mature adult form of the maggots‚Äîwhich the Doctor kills by throwing his cloak over it when it is in mid-air, causing it to get tangled in it and fall to the ground. The Doctor returns to Global Chemicals to confront the BOSS. The computer plans to link up with others and effect a corporate takeover of the human race. By now, Stevens is completely under the computer's control. The Doctor tells Stevens that the BOSS' \\"efficiency\\" will result in greater pollution, brainless brainwashed humans, and more death and disease. The Doctor then uses his blue crystal to break Stevens' hypnotic state, and Stevens, infuriated at what the BOSS has done to him, cross-feeds the generator circuits, causing the whole plant to explode, apparently destroying Stevens and the computer. The menace defeated, UNIT troops and environmentalists gather at the Nuthutch for a celebration made all the more special when Jo and Jones announce they are getting married. The Doctor gives his blessing and gives Jo the blue crystal as a wedding present, but since this means the end of Jo's travels with the Doctor, he is evidently upset by the situation and quietly slips away while the party is in full swing. As Jo and Jones dance, the Doctor drives Bessie off into the sunset. Production In the footage of the maggots around the quarry site, several of the maggot props were in fact inflated condoms (some inflated with air, others with water). The colliery used for filming was Ogilvie Colliery near Deri, Caerphilly, while Global Chemicals was the RCA International factory in Brynmawr. The script required the Doctor to state that the maggots have \\"thick chitinous skin\\". Pertwee asked producer Barry Letts how to pronounce the word, and Letts, unaware of the term, told him to pronounce the first syllable \\"chit\\", rather than the more correct \\"kite\\". Two days after Episode 4 was broadcast, Letts received a letter consisting simply of the words, \\"The reason I'm writin'/Is how to say kitin .\\" The prime minister is addressed as \\"Jeremy\\", which was a production joke referring to the then Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe. In 2004, Barry Letts said he was unhappy with the colour separation overlay effect used for the cavern scenes in this story. =Cast notes= Tony Adams, who played Elgin, was taken ill during the recording of The Green Death, and so Roy Skelton was brought in to play a new character called Mr James, who was given the lines written for Elgin. In Global Conspiracy (see 'Home media'), Adams actually uses his real illness as an explanation for his character's sudden absence towards the end of the story. The part of Professor Clifford Jones was played by Stewart Bevan. Bevan was at the time engaged to Katy Manning. The fictional couple become engaged at the end of the story, whereas Bevan and Manning separated a year after the show was recorded.Doctor Who: The Green Death DVD. BBC Worldwide.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a favourable review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), though they noted that it \\"patronises the Welsh\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker felt that the story was \\"nicely set up\\", although they said that the script resorted to stereotypes with the hippies and the Welshmen. While noting that the story \\"suffers from an over- reliance on CSO\\" and that the acting of the Global Chemicals employees failed to impress, they praised the maggots, and Jo's departure. In 2010, Mark Braxton of Radio Times awarded it five stars out of five. He described The Green Death as \\"entertaining, frightening, poignant and important\\". He also felt the CSO was \\"woeful\\" but the maggots a success, and additionally praised the moral and cultural messages. In 2012, SFX named Jo's departure as the fourth-greatest companion farewell, noting how it was the first time the Doctor was \\"truly upset\\" since leaving Susan. In 2009, they listed the scene where a giant maggot approaches Jo as the eighth-scariest Doctor Who moment. The magazine also listed the scene where the Doctor dresses in drag as one of the silliest moments in Doctor Who history in a 2010 article. In 2013, Ben Lawrence of The Daily Telegraph named The Green Death as one of the top ten Doctor Who stories set in the contemporary time. In the book Doctor Who: The Episode Guide, Mark Campbell awarded it ten out of ten, describing it as \\"one of the very best UNIT stories, offering terrifying maggots, horrible green slime and some very scary cliffhangers. There is also real character development and an attempt to address adult themes in an adult way.\\" He also thought Jo's departure was \\"one of the series' saddest moments.\\" Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Malcolm Hulke, was published by Target Books in August 1975. The company Global Chemicals had to be changed to Panorama Chemicals because a real Global Chemicals was found to exist. Hulke tells the story from several points of view including the possessed Stevens, the psychotic Hinks and even a hungry maggot. An unabridged reading by Katy Manning of the novelisation was released on CD in September 2008 by BBC Audiobooks. =Home media= The story was released on VHS in October 1996 as a two-tape set. On the back of the VHS box, BBC Video presented this serial's release as a tribute to Jon Pertwee, who had died a few months earlier in May 1996. The Green Death was released on DVD in the United Kingdom on 10 May 2004. The Green Death featured in issue 48 of Doctor Who DVD Files, published 3 November 2010. A Special Edition DVD of the serial was released in the UK on 5 August 2013 containing extra bonus features including a new 25-minute documentary on the making of the serial called \\"The One With the Maggots\\", as well as The Sarah Jane Adventures serial Death of the Doctor, which reunites the Doctor and Jo. The DVD release of this story features a fictitious documentary, Global Conspiracy, starring Mark Gatiss as investigative reporter Terry Scanlon, following up the events surrounding the incident at Global Chemicals. Several actors from The Green Death briefly reprise their roles, and it is revealed that Stevens and BOSS survived.

The Curse of Frankenstein is a 1957 British horror film by Hammer Film Productions, loosely based on the 1818 novel Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus by Mary Shelley. It was Hammer's first colour horror film, and the first of their Frankenstein series. Its worldwide success led to several sequels, and the studio's new versions of Dracula (1958) and The Mummy (1959), and established \\"Hammer Horror\\" as a distinctive brand of Gothic cinema.Sinclair McKay (2007) A Thing of Unspeakable Horror: The History of Hammer Films The film was directed by Terence Fisher and stars Peter Cushing as Victor Frankenstein and Christopher Lee as the Creature, with Hazel Court and Robert Urquhart. Professor Patricia MacCormack called it the \\"first really gory horror film, showing blood and guts in colour\\".  Plot  In 19th century Switzerland, Baron Victor Frankenstein is awaiting execution for the murder of his maid Justine. He tells the story of his life to a visiting priest. At fifteen, the death of Victor's mother leaves him in sole control of the Frankenstein estate. He agrees to continue to pay a monthly allowance to his impoverished aunt Sophia and his young cousin Elizabeth. Soon afterwards, he engages scientist Paul Krempe to tutor him. After two years of intense study, Victor and Paul begin collaborating on scientific experiments. One night, after a successful experiment in which they bring a dead puppy back to life, Victor suggests that they create a perfect human being from body parts. Paul assists Victor at first, but eventually withdraws, unable to tolerate the continued scavenging of human remains, particularly after Victor's fianc√©e‚Äîhis now grown-up cousin Elizabeth‚Äîcomes to live with them. Frankenstein assembles his creation with a robber's corpse found on a gibbet and both hands and eyes purchased from charnelhouse-workers. For the brain, Victor seeks out an ageing and distinguished professor, so that the creature can have a sharp mind and the accumulation of a lifetime of knowledge. He invites the professor to his house in the guise of a friendly visit, but pushes him over the stair banister, killing him, and makes it look like an accident. After the professor is buried, Victor proceeds to the vault and removes his brain. Paul attempts to stop him, and the brain is damaged in the ensuing scuffle. Paul also tries to persuade Elizabeth to leave the house, as he has before, but she refuses. With all of the parts assembled, Victor Frankenstein brings the creature to life. Unfortunately, the creature's damaged brain leaves it violent and psychotic, without the professor's intelligence. Frankenstein locks up the creature, but it escapes and kills an old blind man that it encounters in the woods. After Paul shoots the creature in the eye, he and Victor bury it in the woods. However, after Paul leaves town, Frankenstein digs up the creature and brings it back to life. Justine, with whom Victor has been having an affair, claims that she is pregnant by him and she threatens to tell the authorities about his strange experiments if he refuses to marry her, prompting him to have her killed by the monster. Paul returns to the house at Elizabeth's invitation the evening before she and Victor are to be married. Victor shows him the revived creature, and Paul threatens to report Victor to the authorities. The monster escapes up on to the roof where it threatens Elizabeth, but Victor arrives and throws an oil- lamp at it, causing it to fall through the roof-light and into a vat of acid, where it dissolves, destroying all evidence that it existed. The priest does not believe Victor Frankenstein's story. When Paul visits him, Victor begs Paul to testify that it was the creature who killed Justine, but he refuses and denies all knowledge of the mad experiment. Paul joins Elizabeth, who is waiting outside, and tells her there is nothing they can do for Victor. After they leave, Victor is led away to the guillotine.

Later, both men were cut out of their profit participation making only a $5000 fee for bringing the production to Hammer.Interview with Max Rosenberg for the Blu-ray of \\"Asylum\\", December 2017 Rosenberg and Subotsky later established Amicus Films, Hammer's main rival in the production of horror films during the 1960s. Screenwriter Jimmy Sangster, who adapted Mary Shelley's novel for Hammer, never mentioned seeing Subotsky's script or being aware of Rosenberg's involvement. Sangster had worked as a production manager and said that he was keenly aware of production costs and kept the budget in mind when writing the script. Sangster said that his awareness of cost influenced him to not write scenes involving the villagers storming the castle that was typically seen in the Universal horror films \\"because we couldn't afford it\\". Sangster in an interview with film historian Jonathan Rigby indicated that he hadn't seen any of the Frankenstein films that Universal made. He just adapted the book \\"the way I saw it\\". Peter Cushing, who was then best known for his many high-profile roles in British television, had his first lead part in a movie with this film. Meanwhile, Christopher Lee's casting resulted largely from his height (6' 5\\"), though Hammer had earlier considered the even taller (6 '7\\") Bernard Bresslaw for the role. Universal fought hard to prevent Hammer from duplicating aspects of their 1931 film, and so it was down to make-up artist Phil Leakey to design a new look for the creature bearing no resemblance to the Boris Karloff original created by Jack Pierce. Production of The Curse of Frankenstein began, with an investment of ¬£65,000, on 19 November 1956 at Bray Studios with a scene showing Baron Frankenstein cutting down a highwayman from a wayside gibbet. The film opened at the London Pavilion on 2 May 1957 with an X certificate from the censors.  Release  The Curse of Frankenstein premiered in London on 2 May 1957 at Warner Theatre in Leicester Square. It received a general released in the United Kingdom on 20 May 1957 where it was distributed by Warner Brothers and supported by the film Woman of Rome. The film was reissued in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s where it was distributed by Rank/Universal International where it was a double feature with The Mummy. The film was released in the United States on 20 July 1957 where it was distributed by Warner Bros and released with the film X the Unknown. It was reissued in the United States on 16 December 1964, when it was released with Dracula (1958). The film was remastered in the open matte aspect ratio of 1.37:1 for its 2013 release on Blu-ray. The restored film includes the magnified eyeball shot, missing from the U.S print, but not the head in the acid bath scene which remains lost.Hammer film site retrieved 28 June 2012 = Box office = The film was a tremendous financial success and reportedly grossed more than 70 times its production cost during its original theatrical run. In its first week at the Paramount on Broadway, Variety reported,\\"Curse\\" Wham $72,000\\" and noted,\\"it gave the Par flagship its biggest opening week on straight-film policy in the last two years\\". Variety continued to be impressed with its box office numbers: first week Los Angeles, \\"Curse\\" Terrif $30,900\\" when the average ticket price was 60 cents to $1.10. In an era when horror films typically played for one week, \\"Curse\\" was often held over for two and sometimes three weeks in major markets like Boston.  Reception  When it was first released, The Curse of Frankenstein outraged many reviewers. Dilys Powell of The Sunday Times wrote that such productions left her unable to \\"defend the cinema against the charge that it debases\\", while the Tribune opined that the film was \\"Depressing and degrading for anyone who loves the cinema\\". In the United Kingdom, the Monthly Film Bulletin declared that the Frankenstein story was \\"sacrificed by an ill-made script, poor direction and performance, and above all, a preoccupation with disgusting-not horrific- charnelry\\" The review did praise some elements of the film, noting \\"excellent art direction and colour\\" and the film score. Reactions were mixed in the United States. Film Bulletin wrote \\"rattling good horror show . . . the Frankenstein monster has been ghoulishly and somewhat gleefully resurrected by our English cousins\\". Harrison's Reports, \\"well produced but extremely gruesome. The photography is very fine, and so is the acting\\". Bosley Crowther in The New York Times was dismissive \\"routine horror picture\\" and oddly enough opined that \\"everything that happens, has happened the same way in previous films.\\" Variety noted, \\"Peter Cushing gets every inch of drama from the leading role, making almost believable the ambitious urge and diabolical accomplishment. Direction and camera work are of a high order\\". Later directors such as Martin Scorsese and Tim Burton have paid tribute to it as an influence on their work. Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 81%, based on , with a rating average of 7.04/10.  Sequels  Unlike the Universal Frankenstein series of the 1930s and 1940s, in which the character of the Monster was the recurring figure while the doctors frequently changed, it is Baron Frankenstein that is the connective character throughout the Hammer series, while the monsters change. Peter Cushing played the Baron in each film except for The Horror of Frankenstein, which was a remake of the original The Curse of Frankenstein done with a more comedic touch, and featuring a young cast headed by Ralph Bates and Veronica Carlson. * The Revenge of Frankenstein (1958) * The Evil of Frankenstein (1964) * Frankenstein Created Woman (1967) * Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) * The Horror of Frankenstein (1970, without Peter Cushing) * Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell (1974)  In other media  A novelization of the film was written by John Burke as part of his book The Hammer Horror Film Omnibus (1966). The film was adapted as fumetti by Warren Publishing in 1966 (along with Horror of Dracula). It was also adapted into a 20-page comic strip published in two parts in the December 1976 and January 1977 issues of the magazine The House of Hammer (volume 1, issue #'s 2 and 3, published by General Book Distribution). It was drawn by Alberto Cuyas from a script by Donne Avenell (based on the John Burke novelization).

Evans (1846‚Äì1912). Evans was launched on 4 October 1942 by Gulf Shipbuilding Co., Chickasaw, Alabama; sponsored by Mrs. C. E. Isherwood; and commissioned on 11 December 1943, Commander F. C. Camp in command. Service history Evans reached Majuro on 29 March 1944 from Pearl Harbor and the East Coast, and after escorting to a midocean fueling rendezvous, conducted independent antisubmarine patrols around Japanese-held atolls in the Marshall Islands until 13 May. After training in the Hawaiian Islands, she departed Pearl Harbor on 3 June to screen the fueling and aircraft replacement group supporting both the fast carrier task force and the carrier escort force during the assault and capture of Saipan which began on 15 June. She continued to screen this fueling group through the summer as the Marianas were won, returning to Eniwetok to replenish from time to time. On 26 August 1944, Evans sailed from Eniwetok to screen the fueling and aircraft replacement group for the assault and occupation of the Palau Islands, and arriving at Ulithi on 30 October, served on patrol and escort duty there through 11 January 1945. After a special assignment to hunt submarines near Yap and to bombard that island, from 11 to 13 January, Evans sailed to Saipan, from which she screened transports to the landings on Iwo Jima on 19 February. She conducted shore bombardment and supported the troops ashore with harassing fire on Japanese positions, then screened escort carriers until 8 March, when she sailed to Ulithi. Broadside view of Evans showing her battle damage upon arrival at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 28 July 1945. Evans cleared Ulithi on 21 March 1945 to screen escort carriers in pre-invasion air strikes on Okinawa and served with them through the 1 April assault on the island, and until 2 May, when she put into Kerama Retto. Eight days later, she got underway with for a radar picket station northwest of Okinawa. During the first night on station, 10‚Äì11 May, enemy planes were constantly in evidence; more than a hundred attacked the two destroyers and the two LCSs with them. Evans fought determinedly against this overwhelming assault, shooting down many of them, but in quick succession, four kamikazes struck her. After engineering spaces flooded, and she lost power, Evans crew strove to save her, using portable fire extinguishers and bucket brigades. They succeeded, though 32 were killed and 27 wounded, and the ship was towed into Kerama Retto on 14 May for repairs. She was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for high gallantry and achievement. After emergency repairs at Kerama Retto, Evans was towed to San Francisco, where she was decommissioned on 7 November, and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November 1945. She was sold for scrap on 11 February 1947. Honors In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, Evans received five battle stars for her World War II service.

He was best known for ranting poetry and his provocative, unapologetic music journalism. In June 2006, he wrote in the Philadelphia Weekly about his treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma. After being in remission for a short time, he was diagnosed with enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma in January 2009 and died on 24 June 2009 in Philadelphia.  Career  Wells was born in Swindon but moved to Bradford when young. The son of a company director, he attended Hanson comprehensive school in Bradford, but left with minimal qualifications in 1977 and later worked in a factory and as a bus conductor. It was at this time that he became involved with punk rock, including the radical socialist Leeds art-punk band The Mekons. In 1981, whilst living in Leeds, he began performing as a ranting poet and comedian under the names Seething Wells, Swells and Susan Williams. He was a support act to various northern English punk bands, such as The Fall, Delta Five, The Mekons and Gang of Four, along with fellow ranting poets Attila The Stockbroker, Swift Nick, Little Brother, Mark Miwurdz, and Porky The Poet. After moving to London, he began to write for NME, initially under the name Susan Williams. He championed socialist soul/punk band The Redskins; American hardcore punk bands such as Black Flag and the Butthole Surfers; British bands that merged thrash, hardcore and heavy metal, such as Extreme Noise Terror, Napalm Death; and certain pop artists, such as Daphne and Celeste. However, Wells was also critical of some artists and individuals such as Richard Branson, and when covering his appearance in issue #160 of the British Transformers comic, mockingly called Branson \\"the world's richest bearded git\\" and Transformers a \\"crap comic\\". In the 1990s, he diversified, occasionally writing comedy (for shows such as On the Hour and The Day Today) and other non-music related journalism. In 1992, he and Nick Small formed GobTV, a music video directing partnership. GobTV videos were characterised by extreme visuals, rapid edits, a political agenda and humour. GobTV made promos for The Wildhearts, Manic Street Preachers, and Skunk Anansie amongst others, and were the top UK directors in 1994 and 1995.Promo: house magazine of the UK music video industry, 1995 The partnership ended in 1996. In 1999 he started the Attack! Books publishing house and his debut novel was Tits Out Teenage Terror Totty. His illustrated history Punk: The Stories Behind the Songs was published in 2004. In 2009 he contributed a story to the Love Hotel City anthology. Wells became a sports columnist for The Guardian, FourFourTwo, 90 Minutes, The Quietus music website and the Philadelphia Weekly, and was in the process of writing several books. Tributes There were many tributes to Wells after his death. Musician Billy Bragg wrote: \\"The antithesis of the bonehead racist, he was in fact an articulate left-winger and unlike the bully boy who only picks on those weaker than him, Swells chose to target the powerful, the popular, the hip and the cool.\\"Billy Bragg Remembers Steven Wells Music journalist Everett True described Wells as \\"a tastemaker. He informed people's opinions, challenged them, led them, changed them‚Ä¶most of this by default, by sheer force of his personality and peerless ability to entertain.\\". Boff Whalley, of anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba wrote: \\"Seething (Steven) Wells died two days ago. Then tonight, starting to write this, I find out that Michael Jackson has died.

The area was historically a waterworks that supplied London with water from the River Thames. Nowadays it is mainly a residential area, with the notable exception of decommissioned filter beds ‚Äî the Seething Wells Filter Beds ‚Äî in the northwest part of the area that borders the Thames.  Etymology  The name is a gradual corruption of the original Siden Wells which appears on maps from the 18th century, recorded as the medicinal spring at Soothing Wells in a time-of-construction guide to the South Western railway and its neighbouring countryside.Wyld's South Western London and Southampton Railway Guide Portsmouth, Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands...containing a topological...account of the country and of the towns and villages within 10 miles of the railway Publ. W. Clowes and Sons, London, 1839 Retrieved 2015-03-02 It denoted springs ‚Äî reportedly warm springs of potable water.  Geography  Seething Wells Filter Beds Seething Wells is considered to roughly consist of any land previously used as a waterworks on the southeast bank of the Thames facing Hampton Court Park. This land lies primarily in Surbiton in Greater London, although a small part of this land extends into Elmbridge in Surrey. The Seething Wells area is now primarily residential, bordering Long Ditton Recreation Ground on the west side, and the Victoria Recreation Ground to the south. As well as many houses, the residential area contains a hall of residence for Kingston University, and an old waterworks building that has been converted inside into a gym. On the east side is a clock tower in a small area called Electric Parade. A small plot of land inside the residential area is still used for pumping water, operated by Thames Water. Marina in the west of Seething Wells Towards the west end of the of Seething Wells riverbank there is a marina. Midway along the riverbank there are 7, approximately 8 metre deep, decommissioned filter beds known as the Seething Wells Filter Beds (or less commonly, the Surbiton Filter Beds). At the southwest end of the filter bed site is a former coal wharf, with a former pump house building on top; near the site's centre there are a few pumps and pipes which are still in use. At the northeast section of the riverbank there is another marina, with Ravens Ait around 20 metres further northeast in the river. The decommissioned filter beds are within the 0.23 km¬≤ Riverside South Conservation Area which was identified in 2003.List of conservation areas - Riverside South Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Retrieved 2015-03-02  History  There is no evidence of any substantial early settlement of the area, although a few Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Roman artifacts were discovered during the waterworks' construction. From medieval times to the early 1800s the area is thought to have been home to several springs and wells (giving rise to the name \\"Seething Wells\\") that were purported to have healing properties. In 1808 the area was enclosed for the first time, by the Baron King, and by this point had become occupied by around 200 people. The Metropolis Water Act 1852 prohibited the extraction of water for household purposes from the tidal Thames. The Lambeth Waterworks Company anticipated this by choosing to build their works at Seething Wells in 1847, which were purchased around 1849, and completed and opened in 1852. Another company - the Chelsea Waterworks Company - joined the Lambeth Waterworks Company here, they started construction in 1854 and opened in 1856. The Lambeth Waterworks played a part in John Snow's investigations into cholera; he showed that homes supplied from further downriver by the Southwark and Vauxhall Waterworks Company had a cholera mortality rate 14 times that of homes supplied by Seething Wells, which was upriver and hence had cleaner water. Remaining, functioning, surface level water pipes in the residential area Despite carrying less disease, the inlets at Seething Wells sucked up too much mud with the water because of turbulence caused by the twin-mouthed River Mole, The Rythe, and the sharp bend in the Thames. The Lambeth Waterworks Company thus built a replacement intake at Molesey, and the Chelsea Waterworks Company followed them there three years later, after attempting to build works opposite Hampton Court. This left the two companies with just water treatment works at Seething Wells, which existed side by side until they were incorporated into the Metropolitan Water Board in 1903, which was in turn incorporated into the Thames Water Authority in 1973. The water treatment works was privatized as part of Thames Water in 1989, and it was mostly decommissioned by Thames Water in 1992. In the early 21st century, most of the old waterworks were turned into a residential area, with the notable exception of 7 decommissioned filter beds ‚Äî the Seething Wells Filter Beds. Several of the old waterworks buildings were converted inside, instead of being knocked down. The Electric Parade area and the 130 year old Victoria Recreation Park at the edge of Seething Wells were not located inside the actual waterworks. Electric Parade originated as a row of shops along the pavement (Parade) of a road that used to be called Electric Parade; they were built around 1904-05 when electricity (Electric) first arrived in Surbiton, and were among the first in the area to use this new technology. The original shops all closed and were replaced with new ones within 15-20 years, a trend which has continued into the 2020s. Later on, the road was renamed to Brighton Road A243, and Electric Parade now refers to the narrow road and area facing the backs of these shops. The clock tower at the northwest end of the road used to have a globe on top, but it was damaged by a V-1 in WWII and replaced with a bell.  Transport  Seething Wells is served most directly by the Transport for London Electric Parade and Victoria Recreation Ground K3 bus stops, as well as the Seething Wells Kingston University Campus, St Leonard's Road, and Cleaveland Road bus stops run by several private companies. It is also around half a mile from Surbiton railway station. Additionally, there are passenger ferries just north of the river side of Seething Wells.

History ZTE, initially founded as Zhongxing Semiconductor Co., Ltd in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in 1985, was incorporated by a group of investors associated with China's Ministry of Aerospace Industry. In March 1993, Zhongxing Semiconductor changed its name to Zhongxing New Telecommunications Equipment Co., Ltd with capital of RMB 3 million, and created a new business model as a \\"state-owned and private- operating\\" economic entity. Ties to the state notwithstanding, the firm evolved into the publicly traded ZTE Corporation, having made an initial public offering (IPO) on the Shenzhen stock exchange in 1997 and another on the Hong Kong stock exchange in December 2004. While the company initially profited from domestic sales,UPDATE 1-ZTE says 2010 net profit up 32 pct on better sales reuters.com, Thu 27 January 2011 it vowed to use proceeds of its 2004 Hong Kong IPO to further expand R&D;, overseas sales to developed nations, and overseas production.A Global Telecom Titan Called...ZTE?

By 2009, the company had become the third-largest vendor of GSM telecom equipment worldwide, and about 20% of all GSM gear sold throughout the world that year was ZTE branded.INTERVIEW-China's ZTE aims for fifth of global GSM gear market reuters.com, Tue 17 November 2009 10:53 pm EST As of 2011 it holds around 7% of the key LTE patentsChina's ZTE targets 10 pct of LTE patents reuters, 11 January 2011 and that same year launched the world's first smartphone with dual GPS/GLONASS navigation, MTS 945. ZTE claims to devote 10% of its annual revenue to research and development, producing patents and utility licenses at a rapid pace. ZTE has filed 48,000 patents globally, with more than 13,000 granted. In two consecutive years (2011 and 2012), ZTE was granted the largest number of patent applications globally, which is a first for a Chinese company.Yahoo reported ZTE as first Chinese company to rank No.1 in global patent applications = U.S. sanctions and import ban = In March 2017, ZTE pleaded guilty to illegally exporting U.S. technology to Iran and North Korea in violation of trade sanctions, and was fined a total of US$1.19 billion by the U.S. Department of Commerce. It was the largest-ever U.S. fine for export control violations. ZTE was allowed to continue working with U.S. companies, provided that it properly reprimand all employees involved in the violations. However, the Department of Commerce found that ZTE had violated these terms and made false statements regarding its compliance, having fired only 4 senior officials and still providing bonuses to 35 other employees involved in the violations. On 16 April 2018, the Department of Commerce banned U.S. companies from providing exports to ZTE for seven years. At least 25% of components on recent ZTE smartphones originated from the U.S., including Qualcomm processors and certified Android software with Google Mobile Services. An analyst stated that it would take a significant amount of effort for ZTE to redesign its products as to not use U.S.-originated components. On 9 May 2018, ZTE announced that, although it was \\"actively communicating with the relevant U.S. government departments\\" to reverse the export ban, it had suspended its \\"major operating activities\\" (including manufacturing) and trading of its shares. On 13 May 2018, U.S. president Donald Trump stated that he would be working with Chinese president Xi Jinping to reverse the ban. It was argued that the export ban was being used as leverage by the United States as part of an ongoing trade dispute with China. On 7 June 2018, ZTE agreed to a settlement with the Department of Commerce in order to lift the import ban. The company agreed to pay a US$1 billion fine, place an additional US$400 million of suspended penalty money in escrow, replace its entire senior management, and establish a compliance department selected by the Department. Later that month, the U.S. Senate passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 that blocked the settlement, and banned the federal government from purchasing equipment from Huawei and ZTE (citing them as national security risks due to risks of Chinese government surveillance). The settlement was criticized by Senators as being \\"personal favours\\" between Trump and the Chinese government, as the Chinese government issued a loan for an Indonesian theme park project with a Trump golf course following the May 2018 announcement. However, the House version of the bill, signed by Trump, did not include the provision blocking the settlement, but still included the ban on federal purchase of Huawei and ZTE products. On 13 July 2018, the denial order was officially lifted. In January 2019, it became public that ZTE has retained the services of former senator Joe Lieberman as a lobbyist. In July 2020, the U.S. government banned companies that use ZTE from receiving federal contracts. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint against ZTE accusing it of using two shell companies named Ryer International Trading and Rensy International Trading to violate sanctions against North Korea. = Bribery investigation = In 2020, it was disclosed that the United States Department of Justice opened an investigation into ZTE for potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

This system may help Iran monitor and track political dissidents. =Security= At least one ZTE mobile phone (sold as the ZTE Score in the United States by Cricket and MetroPCS) can be remotely accessed by anyone with an easily obtained password. ZTE, as well as Huawei, has faced scrutiny by the U.S. federal government over allegations that Chinese government surveillance could be performed through its handsets and infrastructure equipment. In 2012, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a report recommending that the government be prohibited from purchasing equipment from the firms, citing them as possible threats to national security. A ban on government purchases of Huawei and ZTE equipment was formalized in a defence funding bill passed in August 2018. Following the 2020 China‚ÄìIndia skirmishes, India announced that ZTE would be blocked from participating in the country's 5G network for national security reasons.

He most recently worked for professional wrestling promotion Impact Wrestling as a producer. Diamond is best known for his appearances with Extreme Championship Wrestling from 1998 to 2001. Baseball career Patrick Kenney was an avid baseball player as a teenager, and was approached by the San Diego Padres to play Major League Baseball as a catcher in 1986. Kenney decided not to sign the contract he was offered, opting to pursue a college education first. Kenney took a job at the Out Of Bounds sports bar as a bartender and attended Virginia Commonwealth University on a baseball scholarship, earning a bachelor's degree in English. He originally planned to play baseball professionally after graduating, but was forced to reconsider after suffering a severe shoulder injury. Kenney's prior baseball career would later be used as an angle when he would visit the training camp of the 2005 world champions, the Chicago White Sox. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1991‚Äì1998)= In 1991, while working as a marketing executive for PepsiCo, Kenney was introduced to wrestling trainer Jim Kettner. Kenney decided to become a professional wrestler, and was trained by Kettner in Salem, New Jersey. Once his training was complete, he worked for Kettner's East Coast Wrestling Association as \\"Lance Diamond\\", teaming with Steve Corino. =Extreme Championship Wrestling (1998‚Äì2001)= In May 1998, Kenney was hired by Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), and wrestled his first match against Nova in York, Pennsylvania. In August 1998, he changed his name to \\"Simon Diamond\\", taking the name \\"Simon\\" from the real surname of his mentor, Dean Malenko. Kenney was paired with Swinger in May 2000 during an ECW World Tag Team Championship tournament and the two later formed a tag team which would endure for five more years. Diamond and Swinger joined forces with C.W. Anderson in mid-2000, and began to ascend the ranks of the promotion. =Independent circuit (2001‚Äì2003)= The impending bankruptcy of ECW in 2001 forced Diamond to seek employment elsewhere, and he began negotiations with World Championship Wrestling (WCW) employee John Laurinaitis, which fell through when WCW was purchased by the World Wrestling Federation in March 2001. Diamond worked for various independent promotions, including USA Professional Wrestling, Border City Wrestling and World Wrestling All-Stars. In Major League Wrestling, he formed The Extreme Horsemen with his two former allies Steve Corino and C.W. Anderson. Justin Credible was also a member, and J.J. Dillon briefly managed them before MLW folded. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling / Impact Wrestling (2003‚Äì2017)= On July 9, 2003, Kenney and Swinger appeared on a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) pay-per-view, beginning a feud with America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm). Enlisting the services of manager Glenn Gilbertti, the duo won the NWA World Tag Team Championships on August 27, 2003, and held the titles until November 19, when the titles were held up following a controversial ending to a match with the 3 Live Kru. Kenney and Swinger separated in 2004 and engaged in a feud, which saw Kenney turn face and embrace his Irish heritage, wrestling as \\"Irish\\" Pat Kenney. After being briefly renamed The Empire Saint, Kenney was not booked by TNA for several months, during which time he spent three weeks competing in Japan with the Zero-1 promotion. Kenney returned to TNA on June 19, 2005 at Slammiversary as the heel Simon Diamond once more. At Slammiversary, Kenney teamed with Trytan (who he referred to as his \\"insurance policy\\") to defeat Sonny Siaki and Apolo. The next month, Trytan was gone, and at No Surrender 2005 Diamond presented David Young, suggesting that, in Young, he had found \\"a diamond in the rough\\". \\"Primetime\\" Elix Skipper joined with Diamond and Young at Sacrifice on August 14. In September 2005, Kenney spent two weeks in India, where he and fellow TNA employees Sonjay Dutt and Shark Boy visited several cities, promoting the debut of Impact! on ESPN Star Sports. On September 28 in Bhopal, a riot broke out when 1,000 fans were excluded from an event after attendance exceeded expectations. None of the three TNA wrestlers were injured. Kenney returned to America in October 2005, and on December 8 started an angle with Chicago White Sox catcher A. J. Pierzynski. At Turning Point the Diamonds in the Rough (Diamond, Young and Skipper) were defeated in a six-man tag team match by Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt and Dale Torborg, who had Pierzynski in their corner. Pierzynszki returned to TNA in March 2006 and was once again confronted by Diamond, who ended up getting hit with a chair by the White Sox catcher. Shortly thereafter Kenney became a road agent for TNA. On November 3, 2008, Kenney was released from his contract with TNA, with them citing budgetary cuts as the reason. On September 18, 2009, TNA Wrestling announced that Kenney had been rehired as a road agent to replace the fired Jim Cornette and B.G. James. Kenney returned to television on the July 15, 2010, edition of Impact!, aligning himself with fellow ECW alumni Tommy Dreamer, Raven, Stevie Richards, Rhino, Brother Devon, Al Snow and Mick Foley in their invasion of TNA. The following week, TNA president Dixie Carter agreed to give the ECW alumni their own reunion pay‚Äìper‚Äìview event, Hardcore Justice: The Last Stand, as a celebration of hardcore wrestling and a final farewell to the company. At the event Kenney returned to his Simon Diamond persona and teamed with Johnny Swinger and Kid Kash in a six-man tag team match, where they were defeated by Little Guido, Tony Luke and Tracy Smothers of The Full Blooded Italians. At May 8, 2012, Kenny substituted Taz as Color Commentator at TNA Xplosion, joining Jeremy Borash. On June 19, 2017, Kenney left Impact Wrestling alongside Shane Helms and Al Snow. Other media Diamond appeared as a playable character in the 2000 video game ECW Hardcore Revolution. Personal life Kenney began dating Dawn Marie in October 1998. Before dating, the two had been good friends for almost two years. They had planned to be married by the end of 2000 or into 2001. They did not wed, but stayed engaged for several years afterwards. After seven years together, their relationship began to come to an end. Kenney and Candice Kenney have a child born in 2010. In 2009, Kenney filed a sexual abuse lawsuit against a former priest at Salesianum School.PW Insider Championships and accomplishments *East Coast Wrestling Association **ECWA Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **ECWA Mid-Atlantic Championship (1 time) **ECWA Tag Team Championship (2 times) ‚Äî with Cheetah Master (1 time) and Steve Corino (1 time) **ECWA Hall of Fame (Class of 1995) **Super 8 Tournament (1998) *Independent Professional Wrestling Alliance **IPWA Heavyweight Championship (1 time) *Independent Wrestling Federation (New Jersey) **IWF Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **IWF Tournament Of Champions (2000) *Jersey Championship Wrestling **JCW Heavyweight Championship (1 time) **JCW Television Championship (2 times) *Major League Wrestling **MLW Global Tag Team Championship (1 time) ‚Äî with C.W.

The species has acquired a large number of other common names within its native range, including American false hellebore, American white hellebore, bear corn, big hellebore, corn lily, devils bite, duck retten, itch-weed, itchweed, poor Annie, blue hellebore and tickleweed. Description V. viride flower at Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington state V. viride is a herbaceous perennial plant reaching tall, with a solid green stem. The leaves are spirally arranged, long and broad, elliptic to broad lanceolate ending in a short point, heavily ribbed and hairy on the underside. The flowers are numerous, produced in a large branched inflorescence tall; each flower is long, with six green to yellow-green tepals. The fruit is a capsule long, which splits into three sections at maturity to release the numerous flat diameter seeds. The plant reproduces through rhizome growth as well as seeds.Plants of British Columbia: Veratrum virideJepson Flora Veratrum virideColumbia River Gorge plants: Green False Hellebore Varieties and similar species There are two recognized varieties of V. viride: *Veratrum viride var. viride is found in eastern North America. It is differentiated by the erect or spreading side branches of the inflorescence. *Veratrum viride var. eschscholzianum is found in western North America. It is differentiated by the drooping side branches of the inflorescence. The related western North American Veratrum californicum (white false hellebore, corn lily) can be distinguished from sympatric var. eschscholzianum by its whiter flowers and the erect side branches of the inflorescence. Distribution and habitat In eastern North America, var. viride occurs from southwestern Labrador and southern Quebec south to northern Georgia. In the west, var. eschscholzianum occurs from Alaska and Northwest Territory south through Yukon, British Columbia, Alberta, Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon to northwestern California (Del Norte, Siskiyou, Trinity, and Humboldt Counties).Biota of North America Program 2013 county distribution mapCalflora taxon report, University of California, Veratrum viride Aiton American false hellebore, White false hellebore, green false hellebore It is found in wet soils in meadows, sunny streambanks, and open forests, occurring from sea level in the north of its range up to in the southeast and in the southwest. Medicine The plant is highly toxic, causing nausea and vomiting. If the poison is not evacuated, cold sweat and vertigo appear. Respiration slows, while cardiac rhythm and blood pressure fall, eventually leading to death. The toxic effects of veratrum alkaloids are directly induced by antagonism of adrenergic receptors. It is used externally by several Native American nations. Although is rarely ever used in modern herbalism due to its concentration of various alkaloids, it has been used in the past against high blood pressure and rapid heartbeat; a standardized extract of V. viride alkaloids known as alkavervir was used in the 1950s and 1960s as an antihypertensive. The root contains even higher concentrations than the aerial parts.Plants for a Future: Veratrum viride The plant was used by some tribes to elect a new leader. All the candidates would eat the root, and the last to start vomiting would become the new leader.Fleurbec Group (ed), 1981, Plantes sauvages comestibles. Saint- henri-de-L√©vis, Quebec, Canada.

Born as Zofia Albinowska, she signed her paintings this way. She later married Witold Minkiewicz, professor of architecture in Lviv and Wroc≈Çaw. She was born in Klagenfurt, Duchy of Carinthia, Austria-Hungary. She started her education in 1901 first in private schools in Vienna, where she took lessons first from Heindrich Strehblow and then, starting in 1902, from Franz Hohenberg and Ferdinand Kruis. During 1906‚Äì1912 she studied in Paris in Acad√©mie Colarossi and √âcole des Beaux Arts. Studying in Paris she was in close relationship with Olga Bozna≈Ñska and received many artistic leads from her. At this time she took many travels inside France and to England, Belgium, Netherlands and Italy. Next in 1909-1912 Albinowska studied in the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, and afterwards she returned permanently to Lviv and stayed there for the rest of her life. At this time Lviv belonged to the Polish (province of Galicia) (being part of Austria-Hungary Empire), later to Poland (independent since 1918) and Ukraine (being part of Soviet Union). For many years between World War I and World War II Zofia Albinowska-Minkiewiczowa was the president of the Polish Artists Union ('). She participated in many domestic and international exhibitions, including Prague, Paris and New York. Her early works are usually portraits, but after 1920 she painted mainly small compositions showing room interiors, still life and flowers. Her works are sometimes described as being painted in a post-impressionist manner. She refused to paint the Soviet commanders saying that she can paint only the flowers. She died in Lviv in 1971.

Laney Amplification does not sell directly to the public, instead dealing with distributors and retailers. History Laney Amplification was founded in 1967 by Lyndon Laney while playing bass guitar in Band of Joy. Lyndon‚Äôs intense interest in electronics, paired with his lack of funds to purchase a proper amplifier, led to his building what would become the first Laney amp in his father‚Äôs garage. As word spread of the tone supplied by Lyndon‚Äôs amplifiers, he was able to supplement his income with amp sales to many local musicians, including Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath. When the Laney signature tone was heard on Black Sabbath‚Äôs seminal debut album in 1970, demand became too high for the new company‚Äôs manufacturing facilities. Laney began manufacturing in the Digbeth quarter of Birmingham temporarily, but ultimately settled in Cradley Heath, where they stayed until 2004 when they again moved to larger facilities in Halesowen. From the late ‚Äò60s through much of the ‚Äò70s, Laney focused primarily on their flagship LA100BL model amplifier and their KLIPP series amplifiers. The KLIPP series integrated a treble booster, similar to the Dallas Rangemaster used by countless rock and blues guitarists of the day. As the 1980s began, there was an increased demand for overdrive and gain from amplifier manufacturers. Laney entered the market with their infamous AOR (Advanced Overdrive Response) series, offering an extra gain stage built in. This was particularly innovative as competitors such as Marshall would require extensive modification to achieve this sound. These amps were popular with such players as Randy Rhoads, Vinnie Moore, George Lynch, and Ace Frehley. Since the early ‚Äò90s, these AOR amps have become a staple of the stoner rock and doom metal tone palette. The 1990s found Laney building on their reputation for innovation with such products as the VC line of amps, which were combo units reminiscent of the Vox AC series, but with built in effects and advanced features. Their now classic VH100R, as well as the GH50L and GH100L head units were also introduced during this time period, gaining acclaim with such devotees as Paul Gilbert, Andy Timmons, John 5, and Joe Satriani. Laney also introduced Tony Iommi‚Äôs first signature amplifier, the GH100TI, in 1995. In the new millennium, Laney has introduced several innovative product lines. These include the TT series, which combined the sounds of their classic rock heads with modern MIDI integration. Also introduced were the NEXUS series bass amplifiers, the retro styled Lionheart range, and the CUB series of lower wattage, economy amplifiers. In 2012 Laney introduced the new Tony Iommi signature amplifier series, which includes a 100-watt head, 4x12‚Äù cabinet, and a 15-watt 1x12‚Äù combo unit. They also unveiled their highly acclaimed Ironheart series, which caters to metal guitarists. In early 2016 Laney Amplification produced several reproductions of its flagship LA100BL amplifier at the request of Tony Iommi and his guitar Tech Mike Clement. 13 amplifiers were reproduced in honor of Black Sabbath's 13 album. These reproduction amplifiers were used on Black Sabbath's \\"The End\\" Tour in 2016 for the older songs that were originally recorded using the Laney LA100BL amplifiers.http://www.laney.co.uk/ References External links * Laney Amplification *NAMM Oral History Interview with Lyndon Laney January 16, 2010 Audio equipment manufacturers of the United Kingdom Guitar amplifier manufacturers ","title":"Laney Amplification"},{"id":"1785196","text":"thumb Reginald Yarnitz Freeson (24 February 1926 ‚Äì 9 October 2006) was a British Labour politician. He was a Member of Parliament for 23 years, from 1964 to 1987, for Willesden East and later Brent East, with 14 years on the front bench. He became a junior minister in the Ministry of Power in 1967, and then led his party on housing policy for 10 years, from 1969 to 1979, serving as Minister of State for Housing from 1969 to 1970 and then again from 1974 to 1979, and being his party's housing spokesman in the intervening period. He continued as health and social security spokesman until 1981. His soft-left opinions made him vulnerable to the hard left in the early 1980s, and he was deselected in 1985, leaving Parliament at the 1987 general election to be succeeded by hard-leftwinger and future London mayor Ken Livingstone. Early and private life Freeson was born in St Pancras and raised in the Jewish orphanage in West Norwood from the age of 5. His grandparents were Jews who came to the UK to escape the pogroms in Poland and Russia in the 1890s, but he was abandoned by his parents. After a successful school career, he volunteered to join the RAF Volunteer Reserve aged 16, but was posted to the Rifle Brigade for training in 1944 and then passed on to the Royal Engineers in Egypt. He spent some time working for the Inter Services Publications Unit. He worked as a journalist in the Middle East for one year after being demobbed in 1947, and his experiences made him a convinced Zionist. He continued his print career in Fleet Street, where he worked on publications including John Bull, Everybody's Weekly, London Illustrated, News Review, Today, Education, The Daily Mirror and the News Chronicle. He was later an assistant press officer at the Ministry of Works and the British Railways Board. He was married twice. He first married in 1971, but was divorced in 1983. He remarried in 1983, and is survived by his second wife, and a son and daughter from his first marriage. Political career Freeson joined the Labour Party after returning to England in 1948. He became active in local politics, and was elected to Willesden Borough Council in 1952 and became an alderman in 1955. He served as the council leader from 1958 until the post was abolished in 1965. He chaired the shadow council of the London Borough of Brent from 1964‚Äì65, and was an alderman of Brent until 1968. He was elected as the MP for Willesden East with a majority of less than 2,000 votes at the 1964 general election, gaining the seat from sitting Conservative MP, Trevor Skeet. Harold Wilson's Labour government was elected with a slim majority of only five seats, which was quickly reduced to three. Within weeks, he was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Tom Fraser, the Minister of Transport, from 1964‚Äì67, and then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Power from 1967‚Äì69. He served as Minister of Housing and Local Government from 1969 until the 1970 general election the following year. He remained as Housing Spokesman in opposition, and his mastery of the subject made him a fearsome opponent to the incumbent Conservative ministers. With Eric Heffer, he led a Commons protest over the guillotine of the controversial bill which was to become the Industrial Relations Act 1971. Freeson's seat was renamed Brent East in 1974, and he returned as Minister for Housing and Construction in the new Department of the Environment after the February 1974 general election, in a period of high interest rates and rapidly rising house prices. He later added responsibility for new towns, planning, land and local government to his portfolio. He retained his ministerial office when James Callaghan succeeded Harold Wilson as Prime Minister in 1976, becoming a privy counsellor that year, and retained his office until Labour's defeat at the 1979 general election. He remained on the Labour frontbench in opposition, as spokesman on Health and Social Security, but was demoted by Michael Foot in 1981. He later served on the Environment Select committee. He was a member of the Fabian Society, supported the Irish nationalist cause, fought racism, opposed the Korean War and the Vietnam War, was a founder member of CND in 1957, and was one of five Labour MPs on the first Aldermaston March in 1958. He wrote for Tribune, and edited the anti-fascist magazine Searchlight from 1964‚Äì67. He was co-chair of the socialist Zionist Poale Zion (Great Britain), but was critical of Israeli policy (e.g. he opposed the 1982 invasion of Lebanon). He attacked the British Nationality Act 1981, and criticised Conservative policy on Northern Ireland. He was a committed left-winger, but his soft-left views made him vulnerable to the hard left in the early-1980s. He was able to retain his seat at the 1983 general election, but was deselected in 1985 after a bitter struggle, described as \\"political 'murder'\\" in his Guardian obituary, and replaced as Labour candidate in Brent East by Ken Livingstone at the 1987 general election. \\"His support for Israel, said Freeson after his deselection, had led him to be branded 'that bloody Zionist and Jew'.\\" Later life After leaving Parliament, Freeson became a consultant on housing and planning issues. He was editor of Jewish Vanguard from 1987 to 2006, and served as chairman of Poale Zion (Great Britain). Freeson again became a councillor in Brent at the 2002 election, but lost his Queen's Park seat to the Liberal Democrats in the 2006 local elections. He died in Salisbury, Wiltshire.

It can also mean an information table that is used as a quick and easy reference for things that are difficult to remember such as comparing imperial with metric measurements. This kind of data is known as reference data. In the context of database design a reference table is a table into which an enumerated set of possible values of a certain field data type is divested. It is also called a domain table because it represents the domain for the columns that reference it. For example, in a relational database model of a warehouse the entity 'Item' may have a field called 'status' with a predefined set of values such as 'sold', 'reserved', 'out of stock'. In a purely designed database these values would be divested into an extra entity or Reference Table called 'status' in order to achieve database normalisation. The entity 'status' in this case has no true representative in the real world but rather would an exceptional case where the attribute of a certain database entity is divested into its own table. The advantage of doing this is that internal functionality and optional conditions within the database and the software which utilizes it are easier to modify and extend on that particular aspect.

It was written by Ryan Toby, Andre Harris, Vidal Davis and Jason Boyd, and produced by Dre & Vidal for Usher's 2004 album Confessions. The song was released as the fifth and final single from the album on November 30, 2004. The single peaked at number eight in the United States, the only single released from Confessions without topping the Billboard Hot 100, and number nine on in the United Kingdom. \\"Caught Up\\" also reached the top 20 in Australia, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Scotland. It received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Background and release Although Usher \\"didn't look too far\\" when starting working on his fourth studio album Confessions and decided to \\"continue building\\" with previous producers, he branched out with several musical collaborators. Usher enlisted Philadelphia producers Andre \\"Dre\\" Harris and Vidal Davis of Dre & Vidal, along with other musical collaborators. During the sessions, Usher asked them to create a \\"real up- tempo beat\\". When they worked on the track, they partied the whole time which Dre considered a \\"partly record\\". He recalled, \\"We had some women, some drinks, some music.\\" After Dre created the beat, they decided to \\"make sure the mood was inspiring during recording.\\" They went to club to take a break, and played the song in Usher's truck while on the way. Usher felt the collaboration was pleasing, seeing other people responded positively to the song. \\"Caught Up\\" was the fifth and final single from Confessions. It was released in the United States on November 30, 2004 as a 12\\" single. It was also released in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom on February 21, 2005 and on March 8 in Germany. The Germany release contains the album version of the song, three of its remixes and the single's music video. The song impacted US contemporary hit radio on January 11, 2005,http://gfa.radioandrecords.com/publishGFA/GFANextPage.asp?sDate=01/11/2005&Format;=1 alongside a remix featuring rapper, Fabolous. Reception \\"Caught Up\\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics. Andrew McGregor of BBC called the song \\"meaty\\" and \\"hip-grinding\\". Jon Caramanica of Blender magazine referred to the song like a \\"Southern marching band performing late-'80s R&B;\\". He characterized Usher's voice playing like a rhythm instruments. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine complimented Dre and Vidal for producing an old- sounding music without sampling records, calling it \\"super-tight\\" alongside \\"Follow Me\\", another song from the album. Andy Kellman of Allmusic complimented the song as one of Usher's best moments in the album, together with \\"Burn\\". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it a \\"thunderous song\\" from the album, adding that it gave Usher \\"a chance to do two of the things he does best: strut and pander\\".  Chart performance  \\"Caught Up\\" did not live up to the chart-topping performances of Confessions' previous four releases. In the United States, the single debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number seventy-six. It peaked at number eight for two non-consecutive weeks, fifteen weeks after its release. \\"Caught Up\\" was the only single to not top the Hot 100 compared to the album's four previous releases. The single stayed on the Hot 100 for twenty-seven weeks. Outside the United States, responses from music markets were relatively similar. \\"Caught Up\\" debuted and peaked at number nine on the United Kingdom, remaining on the chart for also nine weeks. It reached number ten in the Netherlands, and under top ten on the rest of European countries; much lesser in Finland where it only stayed for one week compared to other charts, remaining for several weeks. In Australia and New Zealand, the single reached number fifteen and twelve respectively. Usher in the video, performing the song to a large crowd.  Music video  The music video for \\"Caught Up\\" was directed by Mr. X, who was behind the laser light treatment of Usher's 2004 video \\"Yeah!\\". The video shows Usher and friends riding a car while heading to his live performance. On the way, they fist fight after Usher saves a woman from an antagonist. Usher realizes he is supposed to perform, and finally goes to the venue. The video ends with Usher performing the song in front of a large crowd. The music video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live on January 10, 2005 at number ten. The video remained on the countdown for thirty-four days.

IP cores may be licensed to another party or can be owned and used by a single party alone. The term is derived from the licensing of the patent and/or source code copyright that exist in the design. IP cores can be used as building blocks within application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs or field-programmable gate array (FPGA) logic designs. History The licensing and use of IP cores in chip design came into common practice in the 1990s. There were many licensors and also many foundries competing on the market. Today, the most widely licensed IP cores are from Arm Holdings (43.2% market share in 2013), Synopsys Inc. (13.9% market share in 2013), Imagination Technologies (9% market share in 2013) and Cadence Design Systems (5.1% market share in 2013). Types of IP cores The IP core serves for chip design the same purpose a library serves for computer programming or a discrete integrated circuit component does for printed circuit board design. In each case, it is a reusable component of design logic with a defined interface and behavior that has been verified by its vendor and is integrated into a larger software or hardware design. =Soft cores= IP cores are typically offered as synthesizable RTL. Synthesizable cores are delivered in a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL). These are analogous to low level languages such as C in the field of computer programming. IP cores delivered to chip designers as RTL permit chip designers to modify designs at the functional level, though many IP vendors offer no warranty or support for modified designs. IP cores are also sometimes offered as generic gate-level netlists. The netlist is a boolean-algebra representation of the IP's logical function implemented as generic gates or process specific standard cells. An IP core implemented as generic gates is portable to any process technology. A gate-level netlist is analogous to an assembly code listing in the field of computer programming. A netlist gives the IP core vendor reasonable protection against reverse engineering. See also: integrated circuit layout design protection. Both netlist and synthesizable cores are called \\"soft cores\\", as both allow a synthesis, placement and routing (SPR) design flow. =Hard cores= Hard cores are defined as IP cores that cannot be modified and are thus \\"hard\\", analogous to the etymology of hardware and software.Hardware is \\"hard\\" because it cannot be reprogrammed, modified or updated to patch bugs or add features. Software is \\"soft\\" because its design is less rigid and more amenable to modifications and updates. By the nature of their low-level representation, hard cores offer better predictability of chip performance in terms of timing performance and area. Analog and mixed-signal logic are generally defined as a lower-level, physical description. Hence, analog IP (SerDes, PLLs, DAC, ADC, PHYs, etc.) are provided to chip makers in transistor-layout format (such as GDSII). Digital IP cores are sometimes offered in layout format as well. Such cores, whether analog or digital, are called \\"hard cores\\" (or hard macros), because the core's application function cannot be meaningfully modified by chip designers. Transistor layouts must obey the target foundry's process design rules, and hence, hard cores delivered for one foundry's process cannot be easily ported to a different process or foundry. Merchant foundry operators (such as IBM, Fujitsu, Samsung, TI, etc.) offer a variety of hard-macro IP functions built for their own foundry process, helping to ensure customer lock-in. ;Note Sources of IP cores =Licensed functionality= Many of the best known IP cores are soft microprocessor designs. Their instruction sets vary from small 8-bit processors, such as the 8051 and PIC to 32-bit and 64-bit processors such as the ARM architectures or MIPS architectures. Such processors form the \\"brains\\" of many embedded systems. They are usually RISC instruction sets rather than CISC instruction sets like x86 because less logic is required and therefore designs are smaller. Further, x86 leaders Intel and AMD heavily protect their processor designs' intellectual property and don't use this business model for their x86-64 lines of microprocessors. IP cores are also licensed for a variety of peripheral controllers such as for PCI Express, SDRAM, Ethernet, LCD display, AC'97 audio, and USB. Many of those interfaces require digital logic as well as analog IP cores to drive and receive high speed, high voltage, or high impedance signals outside of the chip. \\"Hardwired\\" (as opposed to software programmable soft microprocessors described above) digital logic IP cores are also licensed for fixed functions such as MP3 audio decode, 3D GPU, digital video encode/decode, and other DSP functions such as FFT, DCT, or Viterbi coding. =Vendors= IP core developers and licensors range in size from individuals to multi billion- dollar corporations. Developers, as well as their chip making customers are located throughout the world. Silicon Intellectual Property (SIP, Silicon IP) is a business model for a semiconductor company where the company licenses its technology to a customer as intellectual property. This is a type of fabless semiconductor company which doesn't provide physical chips to its customers but merely facilitates the customer's development of chips by offering certain functional blocks. Typically, the customers are semiconductor companies or module developers with in-house semiconductor development. A company wishing to fabricate a complex device may purchase the rights to use another company's well-tested functional blocks such as a microprocessor, instead of developing their own design which would take additional time and cost. The Silicon IP industry is fairly new but with stable growth. The most successful Silicon IP companies, often referred to as the Star IP, include ARC International, ARM Holdings, Rambus and MIPS Technologies. Gartner Group estimated the total value of sales related to silicon intellectual property at US $1.5 billion in 2005, with annual growth expected around 30%.Kiat Seng Yeo, Kim Tean Ng, Zhi Hui Kong Intellectual Property for Integrated Circuits , J. Ross Publishing, 2010 IP hardening IP hardening is a process to re-use proven design, and generate fast time-to-market, low-risk-in-fabrication solutions to provide Intellectual property (IP) (or Silicon intellectual property) of design cores. For example, a digital signal processor (DSP) is developed from soft cores of RTL (Register-transfer level) format, and it can be targeted to various technologies or different foundries to yield different implementations. The process of IP hardening is from soft core to generate re-usable hard (hardware) cores. A main advantage of such hard IP is its predictable characteristics as the IP has been pre-implemented, while it offers flexibility of soft cores. It might come with a set of models for simulations or verifications. The effort input to harden the soft IP means quality of the target technology, goals of design and the methodology employed. The hard IP has been proven in the target technology and application. E.g. the hard core in GDS II format is said to clean in DRC (Design rule checking), and LVS (see Layout Versus Schematic). I.e. that can pass all the rules required for manufacturing by the specific foundry.http://www.eettaiwan.com/ART_8800406094_480102_AN_71148c3a.HTM IP hardening by eetTaiwan Dead link 2011 06 30http://ic.hkstp.org/ip_mpw_ip.html More about IP hardening.

All of these cores are provided under some free and open-source software-license, e.g. GNU General Public License or BSD-like licenses.

In the serial, which is set in 19th-century London, the 51st century criminal Magnus Greel (Michael Spice) travels to the city and poses as an ancient Chinese god to find his missing time machine. Written by script editor Robert Holmes and directed by David Maloney, The Talons of Weng-Chiang was also the final serial to be produced by Philip Hinchcliffe, who had worked on the series for three seasons. One of the most popular serials from the series' original run on television, The Talons of Weng-Chiang has continued to receive acclaim from reviewers and it has been repeatedly voted one of the best stories by fans. Despite this, criticism has been directed towards the serial's stereotypical representation of Chinese characters and an unconvincing giant rat featured in the story. Plot The Doctor and Leela arrive in London so that Leela can learn about the customs of her ancestors. Performing at the Palace Theatre is the stage magician Li H'sen Chang. On their way to the theatre, the Doctor and Leela encounter a group of Chinese men who have apparently killed a cab driver. All but one escape, and he, the Doctor and Leela are taken to the local police station. At the station, Li H'sen Chang is called in to act as an interpreter, but unbeknownst to everyone else he is the leader of the group ‚Äì the Tong of the Black Scorpion, followers of the god Weng-Chiang. He stealthily gives the captive henchman a pill of concentrated scorpion venom, which the henchman takes and dies. The body is taken to the local mortuary, along with the body of the cabbie. There they meet Professor Litefoot, who is performing the autopsies. The cabbie is Joseph Buller, who had been looking for his wife Emma, the latest in a string of missing women in the area. Buller had gone down to the Palace Theatre where he had confronted Chang about his wife's disappearance. Afterwards, Chang had sent his men, including the diminutive Mr Sin, to kill Buller. Chang is in the service of Magnus Greel, a despot from the 51st century who had fled from the authorities in a time cabinet, now masquerading as the Chinese god Weng-Chiang. The technology of the cabinet is unstable and has disrupted Greel's own DNA, deforming him horribly. This forces him to drain the life essences from young women to keep himself alive. At the same time, Greel is in search of his cabinet, which is now in the possession of Professor Litefoot. Mr Sin is also from the future but is a robotic toy constructed with the cerebral cortex of a pig. Greel tracks down the time cabinet and steals it, whilst concurrently the Doctor tracks Greel to the sewers underneath the theatre, aided by the theatre's owner, Henry Gordon Jago. However, Greel has already fled, abandoning Chang to the police. Chang escapes, only to be mauled by one of Greel's giant rats. While the Doctor and Leela try to find Greel's new hideout, Jago comes across the key to the time cabinet. He takes it to Professor Litefoot's house, and there, after leaving the key and a note for the Doctor, the Professor and Jago set out to follow anyone coming around the theatre in search of the bag. However, they are captured. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Leela find Chang in an opium den, dying from his injury. The Doctor and Leela ask where Greel can be found, and Chang tells them he can be found in the House of the Dragon, but dies before he can give them the exact location. The Doctor and Leela return to Professor Litefoot's house. There they find the note and the key to the time cabinet. They decide to wait for Greel and his henchmen. When they arrive, the Doctor uses the key, a fragile crystal, as a bargaining chip. He asks to be taken to the House of the Dragon, offering the key in exchange for Litefoot and Jago's release. Instead, Greel overpowers the Doctor and locks him in with the two. Leela, who had been left at Litefoot's house, has followed them and confronts Greel. She is captured by Greel, but before her life essence is drained, the Doctor, Jago and Litefoot escape and rescue her. In a final confrontation, Mr Sin turns on Greel as the Doctor convinces it that Greel escaping in his time cabinet will create a catastrophic implosion. The Doctor defeats Greel by forcibly pushing him into his own extraction machine, causing it to overload and Greel to disintegrate. The Doctor then captures and deactivates Mr Sin. The Doctor (Tom Baker) and Professor Litefoot (Trevor Baxter) Production Robert Banks Stewart's story outline (\\"The Foe from the Future\\") inspired elements of this serial. \\"The Foe from the Future\\" was adapted by Big Finish Productions as an audio play in 2012. Working titles for this story included The Talons of Greel. This was the final Doctor Who story produced by Philip Hinchcliffe. Hinchcliffe was succeeded by Graham Williams as the series producer, who sat in on this story's production. This story featured the first Doctor Who work by John Nathan-Turner as series production unit manager. Nathan-Turner would succeed Williams as the show's producer from 1980 to 1989. The Talons of Weng-Chiang featured two separate blocks of location shooting. As planned, the serial was to have a week of location filming for the exterior footage, which took place at various locations in London, with the majority in the area around Wapping, in mid- December 1976, followed by three studio recording sessions. Producer Philip Hinchcliffe was able to negotiate the swapping of one of the planned studio sessions for the use of an outside broadcast video crew, which led to the second block of location shooting in early January 1977, encompassing a week in Northampton, the majority of which was spent at the Royal Theatre. A large pile of straw seen in one scene was placed there to cover a modern car that had not been moved off the street. The production team briefly considered giving Jago and Litefoot their own spin-off series. The production of this serial featured in a BBC 2 documentary, Whose Doctor Who (1977), presented by Melvyn Bragg, which was part of the arts series The Lively Arts. Including interviews with Tom Baker, Philip Hinchcliffe and fans of the series, it was the first in-depth documentary made by the BBC on the series and was transmitted on the day following the final episode. The programme is included as an extra on the DVD releases of The Talons of Weng-Chiang. =Cast notes= Deep Roy, who played Mr. Sin, had an uncredited role as an unnamed alien trade delegate in The Trial of a Time Lord: Mindwarp (1986). Dudley Simpson‚Äîwho composed much of the music for Doctor Who in the 1960s and 1970s‚Äîhas a cameo as the conductor of Jago's theatre orchestra. Michael Spice appears in this story as the main villain, Magnus Greel. He also provided the voice of Morbius in the previous season's The Brain of Morbius (1976). John Bennett had previously appeared in Doctor Who as General Finch in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Christopher Benjamin had previously appeared in Inferno (1970) as Sir Keith Gold and would return to play Colonel Hugh in \\"The Unicorn and the Wasp\\" (2008). Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping, in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), praised the double act of Jago and Litefoot and called the serial, \\"One of the great moments of Doctor Who history ‚Äì an effortless conquering of the pseudo-historical genre with a peerless script.\\" In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were full of similar praise for the script, direction, the characters, and acting. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times wrote, \\"The Talons of Weng-Chiang as a whole is a scriptwriting tour de force. With its theatrical milieu, florid dramatis personae and high horror quotient, it makes for Doctor Who at its most blatantly Grand Guignol.\\" The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn wrote that the story was good at \\"genre-blending\\" and homages. In 2008, The Daily Telegraph named the serial the best of the \\"10 greatest episodes of Doctor Who\\" up to that point, writing, \\"The top-notch characterisation, direction and performances, with Tom Baker at the top of his game, make this the perfect Doctor Who story.\\" This story was voted the best Doctor Who story ever in the 2003 Outpost Gallifrey poll to mark the series' 40th anniversary, narrowly beating The Caves of Androzani. In Doctor Who Magazine 2009 \\"Mighty 200\\" poll, asking readers to rank all of the then- released 200 stories, The Talons of Weng-Chiang came in fourth place. In a similar poll in 2014, magazine readers ranked the episode in sixth place. Russell T Davies, lead writer and executive producer for Doctor Whos 21st- century revival, praised this serial, saying, \\"Take The Talons of Weng-Chiang, for example. Watch episode one. It's the best dialogue ever written. It's up there with Dennis Potter. By a man called Robert Holmes. When the history of television drama comes to be written, Robert Holmes won't be remembered at all because he only wrote genre stuff. And that, I reckon, is a real tragedy.\\" Although the script and the general production of the serial has been highly praised, some commentators have criticised elements of it such as the realisation of the giant rat and the depiction of the Chinese characters. Patrick Mulkern, in his Radio Times review, acknowledged the \\"wretched realisation of the giant rat\\". In his volume of British history State of Emergency, Dominic Sandbrook criticizes the giant rat for being \\"one of the worst-realized monsters not merely in the show's history, but in the history of human entertainment.\\" Howe and Walker noted that its flaw was the realisation of the giant rat, though the story \\"still contains its fair share of gruesome and disturbing material\\". Future Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat said in 1995: \\"How could a good hack think that the BBC could make a giant rat? If he'd come to my house when I was 14 and said 'Can BBC Special Effects do a giant rat?' I'd have said no. I'd rather see them do something limited than something crap. What I resented was having to go to school two days later, and my friends knew I watched this show. They'd go 'Did you see the giant rat?!' and I'd have to say I thought there was dramatic integrity elsewhere.\\" The depiction of the Chinese in the serial has been alleged to be racist. Some of the English characters display racist attitudes towards the Chinese characters, which go unchallenged by the Doctor, who normally stands up for marginalized groups. Meanwhile, the Chinese immigrants themselves are portrayed in a stereotypical fashion ‚Äì other than Li H'sen Chang (a major villain who is himself akin to Fu Manchu, but portrayed by a white actor ‚Äì another source of criticism), all of the Chinese characters are coolies or members of Tong gangs. The Chinese Canadian National Council for Equality characterized the content of the episodes as \\"dangerous, offensive, racist stereotyping [which] associate the Chinese with everything fearful and despicable\\". As a result of their complaint to TVOntario, the Canadian channel chose not to broadcast all six episodes of the serial. Christopher Bahn wrote, \\"If it wasn't for the uncomfortably racist aspects of the story, it'd be close to perfection.\\" In 2013, Digital Spy placed it in the Top 10 of Doctor Who, while commenting that \\"Holmes's desire to reflect the UK's 1970s fascination with mysticism and the martial arts led to a rather unfortunate depiction of Asian culture.\\" In 2020, streaming service BritBox added trigger warnings to the serial after the suitability of continuing to host it on the service was called into question by viewers. It was also the subject of a discussion focusing on the representation of ethnicity on archive TV at the British Film Institute. Commercial Releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in November 1977, entitled Doctor Who and The Talons of Weng-Chiang. The script was published by Titan Books in November 1989, entitled \\"Doctor Who ‚Äì The Scripts: The Talons of Weng-Chiang\\" and edited by John McElroy. =Home media= The Talons of Weng-Chiang was released in omnibus format on VHS in the UK in 1988, having previously been available only in Australia. The fight scene between the Doctor and the Tong of the Black Scorpion in Part One was slightly edited to remove the use of the nunchaku (or chain-sticks), which were at the time classed as illegal weapons in the UK and couldn't be shown on-screen ‚Äî a ruling which has since changed. The story was released in complete and unedited episodic format on DVD in April 2003 in a two-disc set as part of the Doctor Who 40th Anniversary Celebration releases, representing the Tom Baker years. On 2 September 2008, this serial was released for sale on iTunes. A special edition version of the story was released on DVD as part of the \\"Revisitations 1\\" box set in October 2010.

The race began in 2003 and was contested six times until 2008. It was one of the three events in North America ranked as Hors Classe (2.HC) stage race events by the UCI, which is cycling's international governing body, along with the Tour of Missouri and the Tour of California. The event was cancelled in 2009 and 2010, and despite its backers aiming for the race to be held again in 2011, it has not been held since. History Conceived by then-commissioner R. K. Sehgal in 2002, the race was developed by the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism (now known as the Georgia Department of Economic Development) for the benefit of the Georgia Cancer Coalition.Georgia Cancer Coalition , tourdegeorgia2007.com; retrieved December 2007 Beginning with the 2008 race, The Aflac Cancer Center and Blood Disorders Service of Children‚Äôs Healthcare of Atlanta will be the race's official beneficiary organization.Official Beneficiary , tourdegeorgia.com; retrieved December 2007 The Tour de Georgia has boosted tourism in Georgia providing 2.3 million visitors and a $26 million economic impact between 2003 and 2006. The race quickly generated international attention when the U.S. Postal Service cycling team began using it as part of Lance Armstrong's preparation for the Tour de France. Armstrong rode in the race before his Tour campaigns in 2004 and 2005, and Floyd Landis won it before his Tour victory (later disallowed, along with all of Armstrongs wins at a later date) in 2006. On 14 November 2008, the directors of the Tour de Georgia announced that the 2009 race would be canceled, but that the race planned to return in 2010. The reason given was a lack of sponsorship, which had caused the Tour to seek some reductions in 2008 bills. The 2010 event was also cancelled for financial reasons, although the race's backers were aiming for the race to return in 2011. As of July 2012, the race has not been revived.

It uses SD flash memory to play MP3 audio files and H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video files. It can also play 13 bonus mini-games, all of which are available freely on the Nintendo website in Japan. Sales of the Play-Yan were discontinued on September 11, 2005. An updated version, the Play-Yan Micro (trademarked PLAY-YAN micro), known as the Nintendo MP3 Player in Europe, was released two days later alongside the similarly branded Game Boy Micro, with features such as MP4 and ASF support built directly into the hardware. Play- Yan Garage Games are not supported in the Play-Yan Micro.  Overview  The Play-Yan launched in Japan in February 2005 for approximately 5,000 yen (USD $47.47). Nintendo originally planned to release the adapter in the United States by the end of 2005, but ultimately was not released in North America. Nintendo did, however, release the micro version in Europe as the Nintendo MP3 Player, and since the Play-Yan (and its successor the Play-Yan Micro) is region-free, it can be imported to other regions and played on any Game Boy Advance. Play-Yan was released in China by iQue under the name of MP4 Player for GBA. It is an MP3 and MPEG-4 player add-on for the Game Boy Advance SP, Nintendo DS, DS Lite, and Game Boy Micro. Music and video files stored on an SD memory card can be loaded into a slot on the right side of the Play-Yan, which resembles a Game Boy Advance game cartridge. Due to its power requirement, use with an original Game Boy Advance system is not recommended. The Play-Yan is loaded directly into the Game Boy Advance game slot of a compatible system. While the original Game Boy Advance is compatible, its non- illuminated screen and the Play-Yan's high rate of power consumption do not make the Game Boy Advance a very suitable platform. The Play-Yan is also compatible with the Game Boy Player, but compressed video does not play back as nicely on a television screen as it does on a small, portable screen. Therefore, the Game Boy Player is a somewhat unsuitable platform as well, at least compared to any standard DVD player. The adapter has its own integrated headphone port, but uses the parent console's power supply, controls, and display. The Play-Yan is advertised as offering sixteen hours of MP3 playback and four hours of MPEG-4 playback on a fully charged Game Boy Advance SP. In addition to multimedia playback, the Play-Yan offers support for minigames which could be downloaded from Nintendo of Japan's website.

The new version is compatible with all of the same systems, and it looks and works the same as the original, but there are a few noticeable differences. The Play-Yan Micro has the added functionality of MP4 and ASF playback, and it has an updated user interface and improved sound quality through its headphone port. Minigame support, however, was removed from the Play-Yan Micro. The Play-Yan Micro was only available through Nintendo of Japan's online store, and for an additional 1,000 yen, it came with a computer application on CD called \\"MediaStage Ver. 4.2 for Nintendo\\" for managing music and video files on a PC. Appearances in other games The stick figure seen in the Play-Yan's interface also appears in the Japan-only GBA game Rhythm Tengoku, and its arcade version, in the rhythm game Night Walk. It was later used as a visualization in the Nintendo 3DS's Sound feature. The character also made cameo appearances in Rhythm Heaven and Rhythm Heaven Fever, and has reappeared in the Nintendo 3DS game Rhythm Heaven Megamix.

Another solution to this structural problem was provided by the pendentive. Construction Squinch in the Palace of Ardashir in Fars, Iran Squinches may be formed by masonry built out from the angle in corbelled courses, by filling the corner with a vise placed diagonally, or by building an arch or a number of corbelled arches diagonally across the corner.

Founded in 1862, the town contemporarily operates as a National Historic Landmark and is managed by the state of Montana as Bannack State Park. History Founded in 1862 and named after the local Bannock Indians, Bannack was the site of a major gold discovery in 1862, and served as the capital of Montana Territory briefly in 1864, until the capital was moved to Virginia City. Bannack continued as a mining town, though with a dwindling population. The last residents left in the 1970s. At its peak, Bannack had a population of about ten thousand. Extremely remote, it was connected to the rest of the world only by the Montana Trail. There were three hotels, three bakeries, three blacksmith shops, two stables, two meat markets, a grocery store, a restaurant, a brewery, a billiard hall, and four saloons. Though all of the businesses were built of logs, some had decorative false fronts. Among the town's founders was Dr. Erasmus Darwin Leavitt, a physician born in Cornish, New Hampshire, who gave up medicine for a time to become a gold miner. Dr. Leavitt arrived in Bannack in 1862, and alternately practiced medicine and mined for gold with pick and shovel. \\"Though some success crowned his labors,\\" according to a history of Montana by Joaquin Miller, \\"he soon found that he had more reputation as a physician than as a miner, and that there was greater profit in allowing someone else to wield his pick and shovel while he attended to his profession.\\" Subsequently, Dr. Leavitt moved on to Butte, Montana, where he devoted the rest of his life to his medical practice Bannack's sheriff, Henry Plummer, was accused by some of secretly leading a ruthless band of road agents, with early accounts claiming that this gang was responsible for over a hundred murders in the Virginia City and Bannack gold fields and trails to Salt Lake City. However, because only eight deaths are historically documented, some modern historians have called into question the exact nature of Plummer's gang, while others deny the existence of the gang altogether. In any case, Plummer and two compatriots, both deputies, were hanged, without trial, at Bannack on January 10, 1864. A number of Plummer's associates were lynched and others banished on pain of death if they ever returned. Twenty-two individuals were accused, informally tried, and hanged by the Vigilance Committee (the Montana Vigilantes) of Bannack and Virginia City. Nathaniel Pitt Langford, the first superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, was a member of that vigilance committee. State park Sixty historic log, brick, and frame structures remain standing in Bannack, many quite well preserved; most can be explored. The site, now the Bannack Historic District, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961. The town is presently the site of Bannack State Park. Though not particularly popular among tourists, this site remains a favorite for natives and historians alike. Bannack Days Every year, during the third weekend of July, this abandoned town witnesses a historical reconstitution known as \\"Bannack Days\\". For two days, Bannack State Park officials organize an event that attempts to revive the times when Bannack was a boom town, re-enacting the day-to-day lives of the miners who lived there during the gold rush. An authentic, old-fashioned breakfast is served in the old Hotel Meade, a well-preserved brick building which was for many years the seat of Beaverhead County, before Dillon, Montana, became the seat of the county.  Physiography  The mines surrounding Bannack are located on both sides of Grasshopper Creek, which flows southeastward through the district and into the Beaverhead River about miles downstream.

Wildlife and habitat The refuge is in located in the upper basin of the Tensas River, which is also the last documented home of the ivory-billed woodpecker. The refuge also has one of the last concentrations of the threatened Louisiana black bear. In 1907, former President Teddy Roosevelt hunted black bear just north of the refuge boundary and the famous \\"teddy bear\\" was introduced as a result of an incident during the hunt. Concentrations of ducks, geese, raptors, wading birds and shorebirds are present. Several rookeries are in the reserve. In 1932, Mason Spencer, a state representative from the nearby town of Tallulah, armed with a gun and a hunting permit, shot a rare male ivory-billed woodpecker on a large tract of swamp forest land owned by the Singer Sewing Company. He killed the bird to prove to the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries that the creature existed in Madison Parish, as that had been a matter in dispute. As this particular woodpecker faced ultimate extinction, as early as 1938, the Audubon Society persuaded U.S. Senator Allen J. Ellender to work for the establishment of a proposed Tensas Swamp National Park to preserve sixty thousand acres of lands then owned by the Singer Company. Ellender's bill died in committee, but in 1998, Congress established the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge.

This serial introduces Mary Tamm as the companion Romana. The serial is set on the primitive and superstitious planet Ribos. In the serial, the exiled Emperor of Levithia, Graff Vynda-K (Paul Seed), seeks a piece of the rare element jethrik on the planet. At the same time, the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) and his travelling companion Romana look for the first segment of the powerful Key to Time, disguised as the same jethrik piece. Plot The White Guardian recruits the Fourth Doctor to collect the six hidden and disguised segments of the powerful Key to Time. He assigns him an assistant Time Lady named Romanadvoratrelundar, whom the Doctor calls Romana (despite her preference for \\"Fred\\" when given a choice by the Doctor). He warns him that the Black Guardian also seeks these segments, but for an evil purpose. The White Guardian provides them with a wand-like device, which can locate the pieces and remove their disguise. When inserted into the TARDIS console, the locator first reveals a segment to be on Cyrrenhis Minima, but then moves to Ribos. Ribos is an icy planet with late- medieval-type inhabitants who are unaware of alien cultures. A human from Earth named Garron tries to sell Ribos to an exiled tyrant called the Graff Vynda-K. The Graff is impressed by the planet's supposed quantity of jethrik, the rarest and most valued mineral in the galaxy. He believes the opportunity confirmed when he sees a piece of jethrik among the Ribos crown jewels. This is all part of a ruse orchestrated by Garron; the jethrik was planted by Garron's assistant Unstoffe, who also was playing a native with an \\"honest face\\" spins a yarn to the Graff about a nearby lost mine. The locator points the Doctor and Romana to the same jethrik, which must be the disguised segment of the Key to Time. The Graff Vynda-K provides a large sum of money, as a deposit for the planet that is to be kept safely in the room with the crown jewels, watched by Ribos guards by day and a shrivenzale beast by night. Later, Unstoffe distracts the shrivenzale, recovers their piece of jethrik, and takes the money from the safe. The Graff learns of Garron's deception when he discovers a covert listening device in his room. He imprisons Garron with his \\"accomplices\\" the Doctor and Romana, and he starts the search for Unstoffe, who still has the money and the jethrik. Unstoffe hides with Binro, a homeless outcast who believes that Ribos is a planet orbiting a star, and that there are other stars in the universe, which Unstoffe confirms to be true (because he was from Earth). The Ribos guards summon a Seeker who locates Unstoffe's hideout. Using the listening device in the Graff's room, Garron warns Unstoffe about the Graff. Binro, thankful for Unstoffe's encouragement, leads him to the labyrinthine Catacombs under the city, where the natives bury their dead. The Graff and his men enter the Catacombs without the guards, who fear the place, and the Seeker warns that if they enter, \\"All but one are doomed to die.\\" K9 helps the Doctor, Romana, and Garron to escape and go to the Catacombs. The guards destroy the entrance to the Catacombs causing the ceiling to collapse on the Graff's men. Having recovered the money and the jethrik, the Graff gives his last surviving guard an explosive to kill himself with. The guard, actually the Doctor in disguise, swaps the explosive for the jethrik. The Graff walks off into the maze yelling like a madman as the sounds of one of his previous battles resound around him, before exploding. After leaving the Catacombs, the Doctor, Romana, and K9 dematerialise in the TARDIS. Garron and Unstoffe claim the Graff's deserted ship, full of years of plunder, while the Doctor and Romana transform the jethrik into the first piece of the Key to Time. Production Working titles for this story include Operation and The Ribos File. The opening scene, with the White Guardian, was actually written by Anthony Read and Graham Williams, and not Robert Holmes. The serial was filmed entirely in studio, in April 1978. From this story until The Horns of Nimon (1979‚Äì80), Baker wears an extra-long scarf, which is the original scarf and the stunt scarf sewn together. =Cast notes= Elisabeth Sladen, who as Sarah Jane Smith was last seen in The Hand of Fear (1976), was approached to return to the series as a replacement for Leela (who had left in The Invasion of Time). When Sladen declined the offer, the character of Romana was created instead. Prentis Hancock had previously appeared in the Doctor Who serials Spearhead from Space (1970) and Planet of the Daleks (1973) (with Jon Pertwee) and Planet of Evil (1975). Broadcast and reception Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial a favourable review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), calling it \\"a lovely story\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker praised the \\"cracking set of scripts\\" and production values. They described Binro as \\"perhaps the most fascinating and well written of all the characters in the main part of the story set on Ribos\\" and also praised Mary Tamm's debut as Romana, despite noting that \\"she goes through the whole of The Ribos Operation giving the impression that she has got an unpleasant smell under her nose\\". In 2010, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave the story a positive review, in particular towards the acting and production, but stated that he did not like Binro. The A.V. Club reviewer Christopher Bahn called The Ribos Operation one of Robert Holmes' better stories, writing that it was \\"a fun, tightly constructed caper\\". DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave the story three and a half out of five stars, writing that it was an \\"effective beginning\\" to the season despite being a \\"simple\\" story. While he praised Romana's character, he felt that Tamm's performance was \\"a bit flat\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Ian Marter, was published by Target Books in December 1979. Curiously, the novelisation features the Doctor opening the TARDIS doors by means of an old brass knob. =In audio= The Ribos Operation was released on CD in March 2011. John Leeson, who provided the voice of K9 in the original 1978 TV serial, reads Ian Marter's complete and unabridged novelisation of this story. =Home media= The Ribos Operation was released on VHS on 3 April 1995. This serial, along with the rest of season sixteen, was released in North America as part of the Key to Time box set, as well as being marketed separately. The story was released in a restored limited edition on region 2 DVD on 24 September 2007. The DVD box set was reissued in November 2009. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 107 on 6 February 2013.

Playing career Gorman began his career at Celtic, but only played one game, a Scottish League Cup match in 1968. He was released and signed for Carlisle United and was almost ever present in their one season in the old First Division. He signed for Tottenham Hotspur in 1976 before injury as a result of a tackle by Jimmy Case lost him his place. The injury caused him to miss the final part of Spurs' unsuccessful relegation fight in 1977, and all of their promotion season of 1977‚Äì78. In 1979, he moved to the United States where he signed with the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL.Hugman, B, J,(Ed)The PFA Premier& Football League Players' Records 1946-2005 (2005) p242 He remained with Tampa Bay for four seasons and was a 1979 Second Team, 1980 Honorable Mention and 1981 First Team All Star. In the fall of 1982, he moved to the Phoenix Inferno of the Major Indoor Soccer League. He played two seasons with Phoenix, the second after the team became known as the Phoenix Pride. Coaching and management career =Swindon Town= Gorman's coaching career has often been intertwined with his longtime friend Glenn Hoddle, starting when Gorman became Hoddle's assistant at Swindon Town in 1991. With Hoddle as player-manager and featuring in most of the club's games, Gorman received plenty of the credit for this turnaround. So much so, that when Glenn Hoddle left to take over at Chelsea in 1993 he offered Gorman the chance to join him. His mind was made up when Town chairman Ray Hardman offered him the vacant manager's position; he accepted (a popular decision at the time) and looked forward to the forthcoming season in the Premier League, to which Swindon had just won promotion. However, it was not a successful first season in the top flight for the Wiltshire club, who did not win a league game until their 16th match and ended the season relegated in bottom place with just five wins and having conceded 100 goals from 42 matches. A promising start to the following season suggested that a quick return to the Premier League was possible, but a downturn in form dragged Swindon into the bottom half of the table and Gorman was sacked in November 1994. =England= Despite being Scottish, he later rejoined Hoddle as assistant manager of the England team in 1996. After Hoddle's dismissal in 1999, Gorman became assistant manager at Reading. =Tottenham Hotspur= When Glenn Hoddle became manager of Tottenham Hotspur in March 2001, he became Hoddle's assistant at the North London club. =Wycombe and Gillingham= After leaving Tottenham in 2003 he was briefly caretaker manager at Wycombe but was passed over in favour of Tony Adams. He was taken on as an assistant to Andy Hessenthaler at Gillingham, and acted as caretaker manager after Hessenthaler stepped down before returning to Wycombe as manager after Adams' resignation in late 2004 =Wycombe Wanderers= After turning around Wycombe's poor form, the club finished the 2004‚Äì05 season strongly and only just missed out on a play-off place. At the start of the 2005‚Äì06 season, a new club record was set by going 21 consecutive league games unbeaten. Towards the end of the season it was announced that Gorman would be taking a temporary leave of absence for personal reasons, his wife Myra having died from cancer a few weeks earlier. However it was announced on 26 May that the club and manager had parted company permanently. =Northampton Town= On 5 June 2006 Gorman was announced as the new manager of Northampton Town replacing Colin Calderwood. Calderwood was given the Nottingham Forest position after Northampton finished 2nd in League Two and were promoted. On 20 December, Gorman resigned citing personal reasons. He later attributed his departure to stress. He had been in charge for 22 league games, which saw five wins, with just one at home all season. =Southampton= In May 2007 he became the chief scout at Southampton. Following George Burley's departure to become Scotland manager in January 2008, he was appointed joint caretaker manager, along with Jason Dodd. After a stint as caretaker manager, John Gorman was relieved of his duties after Nigel Pearson was placed in charge of the club on 19 February 2008. Gorman and Dodd both left the club in June 2008, following the appointment of new manager Jan Poortvliet. =Ipswich Town= On 30 December 2008, Gorman was appointed Assistant Manager of Ipswich Town, having previously been with the club 10 years prior in the same role. Gorman was released in April 2009 when Jim Magilton was sacked as manager. =Queens Park Rangers= On 8 June 2009, Gorman was appointed assistant manager of Queens Park Rangers, and thus reunited with his old friend, manager Jim Magilton but left by mutual consent in December 2009 along with Magilton. =MK Dons= On 10 May 2010, Gorman was appointed assistant manager of MK Dons, under new manager Karl Robinson. On 2 May 2012, Gorman announced that he was to retire from football at the end of the season after the Dons conclude their League One play-off campaign. Personal life Gorman published his autobiography, Gory Tales: The Autobiography of John Gorman in 2008, as \\"Gory\\" was the nickname given him during his playing days. The book chronicled not only his long playing and managerial careers, but also how he dealt with the February 2006 death of his wife, Myra at age 56, after her year-long battle with cancer. The couple had been together since they were teenagers. Together they raised two children, a daughter Amanda and a son Nick. During his time recovering from injury at Tottenham Hotspur he practised his hobby as a cartoonist, frequently having his work shown in the club's match-day programmes.

Amendments to the Act allowed for the creation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and other procedural court rules. The creation and revision of rules pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act is usually carried out by the Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (known as the \\"Standing Committee\\") and its advisory committees, which are part of the Judicial Conference of the United States, the policymaking body of the United States federal courts. The enactment of the Rules Enabling Act on June 19, 1934, was a revolutionary moment in the history of civil procedure in the United States. The law repealed the archaic \\"conformity principle\\" which had governed actions at law (and only actions at law) in U.S. federal courts for over 140 years; namely, the rule that federal courts should conform their procedure in such actions to that of the courts in the state in which they were located. The conformity principle had caused major problems for federal courts that did not actually sit in the United States, such as the United States Court for China. While the courts exercised rulemaking powers granted to them under the Act without Congressional intervention for nearly forty years, Congress refused to allow the Federal Rules of Evidence to go into effect after their approval by the Supreme Court in 1973. The Rules of Evidence were eventually passed, with substantial changes, as legislation by Congress. Because of Congress's intervention in 1973 and subsequent years, the rulemaking powers granted to the judiciary by the Act have been reduced, causing the Act to command less importance in recent years. However, the Act makes it very difficult for litigants to challenge the constitutional validity of the Federal Rules under the Erie Doctrine.

In 2018 the winner of EUR 50,000 award was Lifemote. History Elisa was originally established on 31 January 1882 by the electrical engineer Daniel Wad√©n (fi; sv) as a telephone cooperative called the Helsinki Telephone Association (, later in ). HPY began serving customers on 6 June 1882 by connecting 56 phone numbers; by 1884 the number of yearly calls surpassed one million. HPY started expanding during the 1920s and 30s by merging with smaller cooperative telephone operators. In 1921, HPY and the over 400 other privately operated telephone cooperatives then existing in Finland formed the Puhelinlaitosten liitto (\\"Federation of Telephone Companies\\") consortium, which was renamed as Finnet (fi) in 1996. The company reached its current geographical operating field in 1958. HPY's original form of incorporation, a mutual association, was changed to a legal cooperative (\\"Helsingin puhelinosuuskunta\\") in 1995, listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange as Helsingin Puhelin Oyj in 1997, and then changed again to a joint-stock company under the name HPY Holding Oyj. HPY was eventually demutualised in 2000, and was renamed as Elisa Communications Oyj. Elisa Communications Oyj left the Finnet consortium in 2001, and would eventually unify all of its offerings under the Elisa branding in 2003‚Äì2004. Logo used from 2003 until 2014 Elisa launched the first commercial GSM service under the Radiolinja brand in 1991 and the world's first commercial UMTS900 network on 8 November 2007. Investment company Novator Partners acquired a 10.4% stake in Elisa in 2005 through a share swap when Elisa bought the smaller operator Saunalahti, which had been mostly owned by Novator. Novator tried to revamp Elisa in December 2007, but was opposed by Finnish institutions such as Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company. In October 2008, during the Icelandic financial crisis, Novator sold its entire stake in Elisa to Varma for 194 million euros (US$266 million), a price of ‚Ç¨11.20 per share. On 27 June 2018, Elisa launched the world's first commercial 5G NR network in the Finnish city of Tampere and in the Estonian capital of Tallinn.

Though the reel may have its origins in Scottish country dance and the Highland reel, and perhaps have an even earlier influence from an Irish dance called the Rinnce Fada, it is generally considered to be an English country dance. The dance was most popular in America from 1830‚Äì1890. The Virginia reel was a popular dance, and in each area there would be slight differences. This has given rise to a large number of dances called the Virginia reel. All of the versions have certain similarities, such as the reel figure. Today, Virginia Reel is one of the traditional dances danced in Finland by upper secondary school students in their prom Vanhojentanssit. The dance Described below is one version of the Virginia reel. The dancers usually line up in two lines of 5-8 couples, partners facing each other. Traditionally men would line up on one side, and women on the other, but that is not necessary. The lines have a head and a foot, with the head couple being the nearest the band or music source and the foot couple at the other end of the line. This formation is the same for any version of the Virginia reel. ;Head lady and foot gentleman forward and back. :The head lady and the foot man advance forward toward each other four steps and retire four steps backward into place. ;Forward again with both hands round. :The head lady and foot man advance, join both hands straight across and make one complete turn, then return to places. The head man and foot lady do the same. ;Do-si-do (pronounced dough-see-dough) :The head lady and foot man advance, pass each other right shoulder to right shoulder while crossing their arms, and without turning, go around each other back-to-back and retire backwards to places. The head man and foot lady do the same. It is then repeated by left shoulder (also called a see saw). ;Head couple gallops four times through the aisle and back. :The head couple join both hands and chasse (side slip and close) down inside of the lines four steps and return to the head position. ;Right arm to partner and reel. (Right to centre, left to the side.) :The head couple link right arms and turn around once and a half. (This leaves the lady facing the men's line and the man facing the ladies' line). The head lady turns the second man (the second man from the head of the line) once around in his place with left arms linked, while the head man does likewise with the second lady. This continues until the man and lady reach the end of the line. :This is where they turn only half way around, instead of a full turn, so that the lady ends up on her side and the man on his side. The head couple then join hands across and chasse (side slip and close) with side steps back to the head of the set. They drop hands and turn out ready for the march. ;The march :The head couple separate. The man turns outwards and walks toward the foot directly behind the men's line, followed by all the men in single file. At the same time the head lady does the same thing on her side of the set. :Then the head couple meet at the foot of the set and walk together to the head of the set, followed by the other couples. When all have reached their original places, all the partners, except the head couple, join hands and hold them high to form a long archway under which the head couple, with hands joined, walk through the gate. The original second couple now become head couple and the whole pattern is repeated until all have been head couple. Variations As said above, there are many variations. One of the most common is this: When the head couple reach the foot of the set, they stop, join both hands to form an arch while the couples behind them join hands and go under the arch and up the center toward the head position. This leaves the original head couple at the foot and the second couple now becomes the head couple. Another variation involves all couples (including the head and foot) participating in the advance and retire, the two-hand turn and the do-si-so with their own partners. Step The step is a bounce to the step when you sashey down the alley and when you reel. Calls The following calls are given by the leader for beginners, or where there are several sets, so that the different sets do the figures at the same time. Music Music consists of lively old time reel music such as Durang's Hornpipe or Old Zip Coon aka. Turkey in the Straw. Students at the university of Virginia dance the reel to 'The Rattlin' Bog' or 'Scotland the Brave' with variations on the chorus at the annual Colonnade and Restoration Balls.

It was signed on 20 October 1655 during the \\"Swedish Deluge\\", part of the Second Northern War.Frost (2000), p. 168 In contrast to the preceding Treaty of Kƒódainiai of 17 August, which put Lithuania under Swedish protection, the purpose of the Swedish-Lithuanian union was to end Lithuania's union with Poland, and set up two separate principalities in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. One of these was to be ruled by the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (Radvila) family, while the rest of the duchy was to remain a Swedish protectorate. The agreement did not last for long and never came into effect, as the Swedish defeat in the Battles of Warka and Prostki as well as a popular uprising in both Poland and Lithuania put an end both to Swedish power and the influence of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs. History The Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family owned vast areas of land in Lithuania and Poland and some of its members were dissatisfied with the role of the magnates, who in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian political system theoretically had the same rights as the Polish nobility. Eventually, the interests of the wealthy clan, known as the \\"Family\\", and the Crown began to drift apart. In 1654, during the Swedish and Russian invasion of Poland, known as The Deluge, two notable princes of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç clan, Janusz and Bogus≈Çaw, began negotiations with the Swedish king Charles X Gustav, aimed at dissolving the Commonwealth and the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union. At the time Lithuania was in turmoil: it was being attacked on two separate fronts by Russia and Sweden, while the Ukrainian peasant revolt known as the Khmelnytsky Uprising was spilling into the Grand Duchy's southern regions from Ukraine. Eventually, most of the Polish-controlled Lithuanian army capitulated to the Swedes and the state collapsed. Most of the Crown of Poland along with western parts of Lithuania were occupied by Swedish forces, while the Russians seized most of Lithuania (except Samogitia and parts of Suvalkija and Auk≈°taitija). Prince Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç On 17 August, Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç signed the Treaty of Kƒódainiai, placing the Grand Duchy under Swedish protection. On 10 October 1655 (O.S.), Janusz and Bogus≈Çaw Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç signed an agreement with the Swedes at their castle at Kƒódainiai. According to the treaty, signed by the two cousins in the name of all Lithuanian nobility, the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Union was declared null and void. In exchange for military assistance against Russia, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was to become a protectorate of Sweden, with a personal union joining two states. In addition, The Family was to be given two sovereign principalities carved from their lands within the Grand Duchy and the Lithuanian nobility was to retain its liberties and privileges. The agreement never came into force. Its main proponent, Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, died only 2 months after it was signed, on 31 December at Tykocin Castle, which was then besieged by forces loyal to the King of Poland and the Grand Duke of Lithuania John II Casimir. The castle was taken soon after by Pawe≈Ç Jan Sapieha, who immediately succeeded Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç to the office of Grand Hetman of Lithuania. The tide of the war soon turned and a popular uprising in Poland broke the power of the Swedish army. The Swedish occupation of Lithuania sparked a similar uprising in Lithuania. The Swedish defeat and eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth abruptly ended the plans of Janusz's cousin Bogus≈Çaw, who lost his army in the Battle of Prostki and died in exile in K√∂nigsberg on 31 December 1669. With the passing of the two cousins, the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family fortunes waned. Bogus≈Çaw became commonly known as Gnida (The 'Louse') by his fellow nobles while Janusz was termed Zdrajca (the 'Traitor'). Their treason against the Commonwealth largely overshadowed the deeds of numerous other family members of the next generation, including Micha≈Ç Kazimierz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç (1625‚Äì1680), who served faithfully against the Swedes. Assessment Although seen as an act of treason by contemporaries, modern views on the Swedish-Lithuanian accord differ. Some argue that the arrangement with the Swedes was made by Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç not out of greed and the political ambition, but rather out of Realpolitik. According to another theory, Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç was merely attempting to secure a strong ally against Russia. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania lacked the resources to fight a war on two fronts, and the Polish Crown, which by this time had its own serious problems, was able to supply only trifling amounts of money and military forces. Ultimately, Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's choice was perhaps wrong ‚Äì the Swedes proved to be not much better than the Russians.

It was published in 2004 by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics, with a trade paperback released in 2005. Plot We3, a squad of three prototype \\"animal weapons\\", are part of a government project headed by Dr. Rosanne Berry and her superior Doctor Trendle. The group consists of a dog, \\"Bandit\\" a.k.a. \\"1\\"; a cat, \\"Tinker\\" a.k.a. \\"2\\"; and a rabbit, \\"Pirate\\" a.k.a. \\"3\\", who were all kidnapped from a nearby city and encased in robotic armor. They have also been given a limited ability to speak through skull implants. Their body armor fields numerous weapons, including mine laying devices, machine guns and razor claws. After the group carries out another successful assignment of assassinating U.S. enemies, a senator makes a visit to the project's facility to see it, where he congratulates the project staff members, only for the General in charge of the project to decide afterwards to decommission We3 in favor of creating newer animal weapons. Berry, unwilling to end the lives of the three animals, instead has them break free. Feeling guilt over her part in what has been done to them, she hopes to be killed by them in the process of their escape; to her surprise, they leave her alive. She is taken into custody by the government while Trendle works closely with the General and the military to terminate We3. We3 escape into the wild and, confused by their new surroundings, decide to look for \\"HOME\\". They are later found and chased by the military, but they manage to brutally kill the attacking soldiers thanks to their cybernetic enhancements. Trendle decides to send his cybernetic enhanced rats to attack We3, telling Berry that if the rats fail the military will use her to lure We3 back. While fighting the rats on a bridge, Pirate drops several landmines after spotting an oncoming train. The mines explode causing the train to derail and fall into the lake below. Bandit attempts to rescue the conductor, but Tinker points out that the man is already dead. Pirate is nowhere to be seen. Bandit and Tinker manage to find Pirate, but Pirate is in a confrontation with a family who mistake Pirate for an alien. Pirate ends up getting shot in the head by the father, damaging his speech. Angered, Bandit and Tinker kill the father and the family's dog, but leave the boy alive. Realizing that the situation is getting far worse, the military send out We4, an enhanced English Mastiff, against the wishes of Berry. We3 take refuge in a homeless man's domain and gain his sympathy. The homeless man encounters the military who have the police escort him from the area, while the man claims that he didn't see anything. Setting up around the area, the military unleash We4, who kills Pirate but is in turn damaged by one of Pirate's mines in the process. Berry is then sent by the military to calm Bandit and lead him into military sniper fire, but as the snipers prepare to take out Bandit, she instead tells him his real name and sacrifices herself by jumping in the way of the sniper bullets. Enraged, Bandit and Tinker both brutally attack We4 and all combatants end up breaking through a wall onto the highway, causing a car pile up. We4 begins to attack a police officer whom Bandit then rescues. At Trendle's insistence, the military terminate We4 from afar using a code word to trigger a bomb in We4's head. Bandit and Tinker escape and, with painful effort, shed their armor, leaving it to explode and taking out some more soldiers on their trail. The homeless man manages to find them again and he removes the two's remaining cybernetic enhancements. Trendle then speaks out against the government's actions, and it is revealed that the now normal Bandit and Tinker have been taken into the care of the homeless man. As he compliments how well behaved the animals are, Trendle gives hundreds of dollars to the homeless man before walking up the steps of the courthouse to a crowd of reporters.

History The Bill for the Yarmouth & Norwich Railway (Y&NR;), the first public railway line in Norfolk, received Royal Assent on 18 June 1842. Work started on the line in April 1843 and it opened on 1 May 1844. In June 1845 the Y&NR; was amalgamated with the Norwich & Brandon Railway and Cantley station became a Norfolk Railway asset.C.J. Allen In 1847 the station was closed due to lack of traffic. The Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) took over the Norfolk Railway in May 1848 and the station reopened in 1851. In August 1862 all railways in East Anglia were consolidated to form the Great Eastern Railway (GER).CJ Allen - Great Eastern - page46 The Railways Act 1921 led to the creation of the Big Four companies and the GER amalgamated with several companies to form the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). Cantley became an LNER station on 1 January 1923. Upon nationalisation in 1947 the station became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways In 1997 the privatisation of British Rail saw the station and its services were transferred to Anglia Railways, which operated it until 2004 when National Express East Anglia won the replacement franchise. In 2012 Abellio Greater Anglia won the franchise. Services the typical weekday service at Cantley is for trains to call at the station hourly during peak and evening services and two-hourly during the day time off-peak. Most trains serve the Lowestoft to Norwich line. The service frequency of trains using the branch to run from Great Yarmouth to Norwich is usually two per day in both directions but this can very depending on the time of the year. Saturday services run with a similar frequency. Sundays during the spring sees eight trains a day in both directions between Norwich and Great Yarmouth via Reedham, every two hours throughout the day until the late evening.Norwich to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft, Greater Anglia timetable, December 2019.

He was a member and correspondent of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences and a respected physician, graduated in medicine and natural history at the University of G√∂ttingen, Germany. Langsdorff first participated as naturalist and physician in the great Russian scientific circumnavigation expedition commanded by Adam Johann von Krusenstern, from 1803 to 1805. He left the expedition in Kamchatka to explore the Aleutians, Kodiak and Sitka; and returned from San Francisco by ship to Siberia and thence to Saint Petersburg by land, arriving in 1808. In 1813 Langsdorff was nominated consul general of Russia in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He acquired a farm (named \\"Mandioca,\\" or manioc) in the north of Rio and collected plants, animals and minerals. He hosted and entertained foreign naturalists and scientists, such as Johann Baptist von Spix (1781-1826) and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794-1868), and explored the flora, fauna and geography of the province of Minas Gerais with French naturalist Augustin Saint-Hilaire from 1813 to 1820. A recent study found that Langsdorff has 1,500 descendants in Brazil, among them the most famous is Luma de Oliveira, a Brazilian carnival queen. Mostra da Expedi√ß√£o Langsdorff no CCBB, 24 de fevereiro de 2010. The Langsdorff Expedition Chart of the Langsdorff expedition itenerary in Brazil In 1821 he proposed to the Tsar Alexander I and to the Academy of Sciences to lead an ambitious exploratory and scientific expedition from S√£o Paulo to Par√°, in the Amazon, via a fluvial route. In March 1822, he returned to Rio in the company of scientists √âdouard M√©n√©tries (1802-1861), Ludwig Riedel (1761-1861), Christian Hasse and Nester Gaverilovitch Rubtsov (1799-1874), who would take care of zoological, botanical, astronomical and cartographical observations during the expedition. With the aim of illustrating and documenting his findings, the Baron hired painters H√©rcules Florence, Johann Moritz Rugendas and Adrien Taunay. The inventor of the bicycle Karl von Drais was also a participant in the expedition. Langsdorff expedition commemorated on a 1992 stamp of Russia After extensive preparations, the Langsdorff Expedition departed with 40 people and 7 boats from Porto Feliz, by the Tiet√™ river on 22 June 1826 and reached Cuiab√°, in Mato Grosso on 30 January 1827. The expedition was then divided into two groups: the first one, with Langsdorff and Florence, was able to reach Santar√©m on the Amazon River on 1 July 1828, with enormous difficulties and suffering. Most of the members of the expedition became ill with tropical fevers (most probably yellow fever), including the Baron de Langsdorff. As a consequence of the febrile attacks, he became insane at the Juruena River in May 1828. Adrien Taunay died by drowning in the Guapor√© River and Rugendas abandoned the expedition before its fluvial phase. Therefore, only Florence remained during the whole expedition. The expedition was joined again in Bel√©m and returned by ship to Rio de Janeiro, arriving on 13 March 1829, almost three years and 6,000 km after its departure. Huge scientific collections were deposited into Kunstkamera and later formed basis for South American collections of Russian museums. However, the rich scientific records of the expedition, comprising many descriptions and discoveries in zoology, botany, mineralogy, medicine, linguistics and ethnography, that were sent to Saint Petersburg by the expedition, were not published and were lost in the archives for a century. They were found again by Soviet researchers in funds of the USSR Academy of Sciences archive in 1930.Still Amazing Amazonia Due to the travel's hardships, Langsdorff team was unable to collect many biological specimens or study them in detail, so most of their account is geographic and ethnographic, being particularly interesting on the many indigenous people of Brazil they met, many of which became extinct. Today, a large part of the material has been recovered and is in the Ethographic Museum, the Zoological Museum and in the repositories of the Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. Langsdorff returned to Europe shortly thereafter, in 1830, and died in Freiburg, Germany, of typhus, in 1852. A species of venomous South American coral snake, Micrurus langsdorffi, is named in his honor.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Part 4 was broadcast during the week of the show's fifteenth anniversary. The serial is set in and around an English stone circle and on a prison spaceship in hyperspace. In the serial, the criminal Cessair of Diplos (Susan Engel) is hiding on Earth after escaping the ship before being prosecuted for stealing the Great Seal of Diplos, the third segment of the powerful Key to Time. Plot Tracking the third segment of the Key to Time, the Fourth Doctor, Romana and K9 arrive in modern-day Cornwall. They meet Professor Emilia Rumford and her friend Vivien Fay, studying the \\"Nine Travellers\\" standing stones in Boscombe Moor. Their work is disrupted by a Druidic sect that worships the Cailleach, the Druidic goddess of war and magic, led by de Vries. de Vries and the sect are hostile to the newcomers, but the Doctor later finds the sect killed by mobile stones similar to those of the Nine Travellers and determines the stones must be alien beings that feed on blood. He and Emilia find evidence that suggests Vivien is older than she looks. Meanwhile, Romana catches Vivien awakening more stones with blood, and Vivien uses a device to send her to a spacecraft in hyperspace. When the Doctor and Emilia arrive, Vivien tells them that Romana will be safe before disappearing herself. The Doctor recognises the stones as Ogri, a life form from the planet Ogros. The Doctor constructs a projector to cross into hyperspace, leaving Emilia and K9 to guard it. On the spacecraft, the Doctor determines it is a prison ship, and inadvertently releases two floating globes called Megara that serve as justice machines. They accuse the Doctor of breaking a seal on the ship and prepare to put him on immediate trial. Elsewhere, Vivien finds the Doctor's presence, and returns to Earth, awakening one of the Ogri and damages the Doctor's projector, but sparing Emilia's life as a friend. She and the Ogri return to the craft to attend the Doctor's trial. K9 guides Emilia in repairing the projector, allowing them to bring back Romana, along with an Ogri. They are pursued by the Ogri, leading them back to Vivien's cottage. There, Romana discovers an alien device that proves Vivien is not human. They lure the Ogri back to the projector, and she and the Ogri return to the spacecraft. On the ship, the Doctor learns the Megara are seeking a criminal known as Cessair, who had stolen the Great Seal of the planet Diplos, which grants its bearer great powers. The Doctor suspects Vivien is Cessair, and attempts to force the Megara to question her, but their law prevents such intervention. Having decided the Doctor's guilt, they fire an energy weapon at him, but at the last moment, the Doctor drags Vivien into the shot. The Megara immediately stop their attack and scan Vivien to see if she is unharmed, but instead discover that she is Cessair. Romana arrives with the additional evidence, and the Megara pass judgement on her. They return her to Earth and transform her into a standing stone in the moor, but not before the Doctor recovers the Great Seal which she wore. The Megara are about to pass judgment on the Doctor when they're forced to return to their ship and depart to Diplos. The Doctor had set the controls of the ship before leaving, and he affirms the Great Seal is the third segment of the Key, and he, Romana, and K9 thank Emilia for her assistance before they leave in the TARDIS. She smiles as she now has a new stone in the circle to study. Production Working titles for this story included The Nine Maidens and The Stones of Time. Contrary to usual practice, the on-location recording in this story were shot on video; a decision by the director to avoid the jarring effect when cutting between film and video. This was a nod back to Tom Baker's first season as the Doctor, when the first story Robot and the third story The Sontaran Experiment were recorded on video tape. The main location was the Rollright Stones, a megalithic site in Oxfordshire, England. An actual legend of the site states that it is impossible to count the stones. As the serial ends, the Doctor notes that the number of stones in the circle has changed (due to the removal of 3 Ogri and the addition of Cessair's imprisoned form) and suggests Professor Rumford write a monograph about it. The first episode cliff-hanger called for a scene in which Cessair, disguised as the Doctor, pushed Romana off the cliff. Baker objected to the scene, as he felt it would be very upsetting to children to see the Doctor as a threat. Instead the scene was filmed so that the viewer never sees who pushed Romana. The fifteenth anniversary of the programme took place on 23 November 1978, five days after the broadcast of episode four. To commemorate this, Anthony Read asked David Fisher to write a new scene (expanded by Darrol Blake) featuring Romana and K9 surprising the Doctor with a cake celebrating his 751st birthday and a new, identical scarf. However, producer Graham Williams vetoed this idea as being too self-indulgent, and the scene was never shot. Blake had already ordered a cake, and this was eventually eaten by the cast and crew. This was one of only two stories between Frontier in Space and the end of the series' initial run not to have the special sounds created by Dick Mills. Due to Mills suffering a brief illness, Elizabeth Parker provided the sound effects instead. =Cast notes= Director Darrol Blake originally offered the role of Vivien to Honor Blackman, who declined the part as she felt Beatrix Lehmann had all the best material. Blake then asked Maria Aitken, who wasn't interested. Susan Engel was finally hired for the part. An uncredited Gerald Cross provided the voice of the White Guardian. Elaine Ives- Cameron later played Ms Lavish in the audio play The Stones of Venice. Broadcast and reception In their book The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping praised the \\"Hammeresque\\" first two episodes, but criticised the \\"woeful\\" final two episodes, ultimately writing that \\"the story disappoints as whole acres of motivation and background are glossed over\\". In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker were more positive, calling it \\"extremely good\\". They praised the directing and noted that the \\"wide variety of different plot elements and two highly contrasting settings, manages to encapsulate much of what has made the series so successful over the years\\". In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times described The Stones of Blood as \\"an intriguing yarn with small stakes and vivid characters\\", particularly praising the female roles. DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave the serial four out of five stars, describing it as \\"a fun Doctor Who romp\\". He opined that the Ogri were \\"arguably the best part of this serial ... a hysterically fun group of monsters\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in March 1980. The audiobook release of this story does not use the Target novelistion by Terrance Dicks, but uses a brand new novelisation written for audio by David Fisher and narrated by Susan Engel who portrayed Viven Fay in the broadcast version. =Home media= This story was released on VHS on 1 May 1995. This release contained an extended cut of episode two, which featured a longer exchange between de Vries and his mistress before they were attacked by the Ogri. This scene had been removed from the UK broadcast of the story because of concerns about its presentation of adults consumed by terror. The scene is contained in full in the deleted scenes package on the later DVD release, which contains the episode as televised. This serial, along with the rest of season sixteen, was released in North America as part of the Key to Time box set which was released on region 2 DVD on 24 September 2007. This serial was also released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files in issue 67 on 27 July 2011.

It is the innermost of the three regions of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also called endotoxin molecule, and its hydrophobic nature allows it to anchor the LPS to the outer membrane. While its toxic effects can be damaging, the sensing of lipid A by the human immune system may also be critical for the onset of immune responses to gram-negative infection, and for the subsequent successful fight against the infection. Chemical composition Lipid A consists of two glucosamine (carbohydrate/sugar) units, in an Œ≤(1‚Üí6) linkage, with attached acyl chains (\\"fatty acids\\"), and normally containing one phosphate group on each carbohydrate. The optimal immune activating lipid A structure is believed to contain 6 acyl chains. Four acyl chains attached directly to the glucosamine sugars are beta hydroxy acyl chains usually between 10 and 16 carbons in length. Two additional acyl chains are often attached to the beta hydroxy group. E. coli lipid A, as an example, typically has four C14 hydroxy acyl chains attached to the sugars and one C14 and one C12 attached to the beta hydroxy groups. The biosynthetic pathway for Lipid A in E. coli has been determined by the work of Christian R. H. Raetz in the past >32 years. Lipid A structure and effects on eukaryotic cells have been determined and examined, among others, by the groups of Otto Westphal, Chris Galanos, Ernst T. Rietschel and Hajime Takahashi starting already in the 1960s (Gmeiner, Luederitz, Westphal. Eur J Biochem 1969)(Kamio&Takahashi; J Biochem 1971)(Luederitz, Galanos et al., J Infect Dis 1973). Biosynthesis The enzymes involved in Lipid A synthesis are conserved among Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bordetella bronchiseptica, and Salmonella. Synthesis of the UDP-diacylglucosamine precursor of Lipid A Synthesis of Lipid IVa Inhibition and activation of immune response Many of the immune activating abilities of LPS can be attributed to the lipid A unit. It is a very potent stimulant of the immune system, activating cells (for example, monocytes or macrophages) at picogram per milliliter quantities. When present in the body at high concentrations during a gram-negative bacterial infection, it may cause shock and death by an \\"out of control\\" excessive immune reaction. Lipid A with a reduced number of acyl chains (for example; four) can serve as an inhibitor of immune activation induced by Gram-negative bacteria, and synthetic versions of these inhibitors (Eritoran) were in clinical trials for the prevention of harmful effects caused by gram-negative bacterial infections. However, trials were recently discontinued due to lack of efficacy seen in patients suffering from severe sepsis. On the other hand, modified versions of lipid A can be used as components of vaccines (adjuvants) to improve their effect. Monophosphorylated lipid A (MPL) is an FDA approved adjuvant that consists of a heterogeneous mixture of lipid A from Salmonella minnesota R595. The major lipid A species present in MPL lacks one of the two phosphate groups and five acyl chains. Other work has shown that the removal of one or two acyl chains from native lipid A can significantly reduce activation of inflammatory responses. The biological activity of LPS depends on the chemical structure of its lipid A. Primarily, TLR4 is required for activation of innate immunity upon recognition of LPS of Gram-negative bacteria. The ability of TLR4/MD-2 system to respond to a distinct lipid A species are clinically important. Pathogenic bacteria may employ LPS with low biological activity of its lipid A to evade proper recognition by the TLR4/MD-2 complex, dampening the host immune response and increasing the risk of bacterial dissemination. On the other hand, such lipid A would not be able to induce septic shock in susceptible patients, rendering septic complications more manageable. Yet, defining and understanding how even the smallest structural differences between the very similar lipid A species may affect the activation of the immune response may provide the mechanism for the fine tuning of the latter and new insights to immunomodulatory processes. Mechanism of activating cells Lipid A (and LPS) has been demonstrated to activate cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), MD-2 and CD14 on the cell surface. Consequently, lipid A analogs like eritoran can act as TLR4 antagonists. They are being developed as drugs for the treatment of excessive inflammatory responses to infections with gram-negative bacteria.

History French version of the train, 1927 The Fl√®che d‚ÄôOr was introduced in 1926 as an all-first-class Pullman service between Paris and Calais. On 15 May 1929, the Southern Railway introduced the equivalent between London Victoria and Dover while simultaneously launching a new first class only ship, the , for the ferry crossing. The train usually consisted of 10 British Pullman cars, hauled by one of the Southern Railway‚Äôs Lord Nelson class locomotives, and took 98 minutes to travel between London and Dover. Because of the impact of air travel and 'market forces' on the underlying economy of the service, ordinary first- and third-class carriages were added in 1931. Similarly the first-class-only ferry, Canterbury, was modified to allow other classes of passenger. The train service ceased at the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939.

The main-line service was revived for a one-off event on 6 May 1994 when it formed part of the celebrations for the inauguration of the Channel Tunnel. It was hauled by the steam locomotive Britannia.

She served as regent of Spain to her brother Philip II of Spain during his trip to England to marry Mary I in 1554-1556, and from 1556 to 1559. She was the mother of King Sebastian of Portugal. Life Joanna of Austria, Princess of Portugal; by Crist√≥v√£o de Morais, 1551. =Early years= Born in the royal court of Madrid, Joanna was the daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor (who was the first king of united Spain, officially King of Aragon and King of Castile) and his wife Isabella of Portugal. Therefore, her paternal grandparents were Philip of Castile and Joanna of Castile, and her maternal grandparents were Manuel I of Portugal and Maria of Aragon. She was the sister of King Philip II of Spain and Maria of Austria. Among others, Joanna held the titles of Archduchess of Austria, Infanta of Castile and of Aragon, and princess of Burgundy. Named for the saint's day of her birth (24 June is the Nativity of St. John the Baptist) and in honor of her paternal grandmother, Juana of Castile, Joanna of Austria was motherless at the age of four and was entrusted to Do√±a Leonor de Mascare√±as. By age eight she could understand Latin and could play several musical instruments. =Princess of Portugal= On 11 January 1552, at the age of sixteen, she married her double first cousin, the fourteen-year-old crown prince of Portugal, John Manuel of Portugal, by proxy in Toro. She arrived at the Portuguese court in November 1552. The marriage was cut short when John Manuel died of tuberculosis at age sixteen on 2 January 1554. However, Joanna was pregnant by that time, and the future Portuguese king Sebasti√°n I was born on 20 January 1554. Joanna returned to Spain in May 1554 at the request of her father, leaving her newborn son with her mother-in-law, the Portuguese Queen Catherine of Austria, who was Charles' youngest sister. =Regent of Spain= Shortly after Sebastian's birth, Joanna was called back to Madrid by her brother Philip to act as regent during his absence in England from 1554. She filled this role with intelligence and efficiency. Joanna never remarried and never returned to Portugal. She never saw her son Sebastian again, although she sent him letters and had portraits of him painted at various ages so she could see what he looked like. In 1557, Joanna founded the Convent of Our Lady of Consolation (Nuestra Se√±ora de la Consolaci√≥n) for the nuns of the order of Poor Clares, also known as Discalced Clarisses (in Spanish, clarisas descalzas) because they did not wear covered shoes, and only walked either barefoot or in sandals, now known as the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales, or convent of the barefoot royals, partly due to her affiliation and that the convent continued to attract aristocratic women as nuns. This convent is now a national monument and holds an art collection. It was founded in the royal palace where Joanna was born and where Charles V had lived when in Madrid. Joanna repeatedly intervened in favor of the new order of the Jesuits, founded by Ignatius of Loyola. In 1555, she is reputed to have been admitted surreptitiously to the male-only Jesuit order under the name of a pseudonym, Mateo S√°nchez. And was in correspondence with both Ignatius and Borgia.

Michelson (born January 14, 1949) is an American orthopedic surgeon, medical inventor, and billionaire philanthropist . Early life and education Michelson and his three brothers were raised by his mother and grandmother. He attended Central High School of Philadelphia, Temple University and Hahnemann Medical College of Drexel University and completed his medical residency in orthopedic surgery at Hahnemann Medical Hospital, before completing fellowship training in spinal surgery at St. Luke‚Äôs Medical Center in a joint program between Baylor University and the University of Texas. He was a practicing spinal surgeon for over 25 years before retiring from private practice to focus on philanthropy. He is of Jewish heritage.Forbes Israel: Jewish Billionaires - Profile of Gary Michelson April 14, 2013 (in Hebrew) Medical innovations & related legal battles Seeing the low success rates associated with spinal surgery procedures on the market during his early career, Michelson developed new technologies, creating implants, instruments and procedures that enabled spinal surgeons to manage more spinal ailments. Implanted globally in millions of patients, \\"Michelson Devices\\" promote effective spinal surgery by decreasing the blood loss, incision size, risks and complications, hospital stay and overall costs compared to earlier procedures. He has over 340 U.S. Patents on instruments, methods and devices for advances in spinal and orthopedic surgery and over 950 issued or pending patents worldwide for instruments, operative procedures, and medical devices related to the treatment of spinal disorders. In 2005, Michelson sold many of his spine related patents to Medtronic for over $1 billion, placing him on the Forbes 400 list where he has since remained. A legal battle with Medtronic over the origins of the patents preceded the sale. Michelson cross-filed in response to Medtronic's suit and was awarded financial damages for both lawsuits by the jury. The legal defense against Medtronic's suit established a major legal precedent in 2004, governing who bears the cost of pre-trial discovery of electronic evidence. Philanthropy Michelson announced his intent to launch a medical philanthropic venture in a 2005 New York Times article. The Gary Karlin Michelson, M.D. Charitable Foundation, Inc. was founded in 1995 and was later renamed the Michelson Medical Research Foundation in 2005. The nonprofit does not accept donations. Also in 2005, Michelson launched the Found Animals Foundation, a 501(c)(3) private operating foundation dedicated to animal welfare. After reading an article in the Los Angeles Times by Sabin Vaccine Institute President Peter Hotez, Michelson became one of the principal supporters of the Institute's fight against neglected tropical diseases, giving birth to the Michelson Neglected Disease Vaccine Initiative. Michelson said he \\"felt compelled to support efforts to develop a vaccine against the four most devastating parasitic worm infections because more than one billion innocent people, many of them small children, are unnecessarily plagued by these neglected diseases.\\" In 2011, Michelson created the Twenty Million Minds Foundation, originally a comprehensive library of higher education textbooks in an open education platform and now an education startup incubator. In 2008, Michelson's Found Animals foundation launched the Michelson Prize and Grants in Reproductive Biology an international competition with a monetary prize aimed at solving the problem of pet overpopulation. Researchers from a wide variety of scientific fields took on the challenge of non-surgical pet sterilization. Recognizing that interested parties might not have access to the funds that the research and testing would require, a companion organization, Michelson Grants in Reproductive Biology, provided limited funding for research. The Michelson Prize seeks to make sterilization accessible and affordable worldwide and aid developing countries. In a program directly acknowledged by the L.A. Mayor‚Äôs office, Michelson‚Äôs Found Animals Foundation paid for the costs of anyone who would rescue a dog or cat scheduled for euthanasia. In January 2014 it was announced that Michelson gifted $50 million to the University of Southern California for the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience. The venue opened its doors on November 1, 2017. In February 2016, through his organization, the 20MM Michelson Foundation, Michelson released a variety of intellectual property tools including a series of videos that foreshadowed the publication of a proper intellectual property textbook. Michelson was a contributing author of the free comprehensive textbook The Intangible Advantage: Understanding Intellectual Property in the New Economy. Released on May 22, 2016, the textbook is devoted to intellectual property topics and was written specifically for non-lawyers and undergraduate students. It includes a working explanation of patents, copyrights and trademarks. In 2019, he presented as a guest speaker at The Future of Intellectual Property: Examining IP in a Changing World. In 2020, he presented as the keynote speaker at the third Intellectual Property Awareness Summit at UC Berkeley. In 2017, Dr. Gary K. Michelson and Alya Michelson, through the MMRF and the Human Vaccines Project, launched Michelson Prizes, which dispense $150,000 awards to specifically support out-of-the-box, high risk, high return, medically relevant research by scientists under the age of 36. Dr. Michelson partnered with the Human Vaccine Project to judge the Researcher Competition. In a companion project, Michelson created a complete undergraduate college course, \\"The Entrepreneur‚Äôs Guide to Intellectual Property\\", which has been taught at the USC Marshall School of Business via its Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies and Santa Monica College since August 2017. On October 30, 2017, at Leveraging Intellectual Property In Today's Knowledge Economy, a kick-off event which took place at the University of Southern California, the new Michelson Institute for Intellectual Property was announced. The new institute oversees the earlier Intangible Advantage IP course and provides resources for both educators and students of the program. It also offers the option of becoming an ambassador for the institute. On October 24, 2018, the seminar, Hacking IP: Considerations for Startups and Entrepreneurs, the first event in a year-long multi-city program, took place in Downtown Los Angeles and featured such ambassadors as Nathan Khalil, Benjamin Kuo, Carmen Palafox and Thomas Peistrup. On January 18, 2019, the California Spay and Neuter License Plate Fund, a non-profit organization founded in 2010 by Judie Mancuso, Dr. Gary K. Michelson, actor Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely Shaye Smith, announced an initial round of grants benefiting low income families in need of spay or neuter for their pet. In 2017, Michelson created the Michelson Prizes for Human Immunotherapy and Vaccine Research in partnership with the Human Vaccines Project. The $150,000 prizes are awarded to early-career investigators who \\"are applying disruptive concepts and inventive processes to advance human immunology, vaccine discovery, and immunotherapy research across major global diseases.\\" The 2020 Michelson Prizes were awarded to Dr. Danika Hill, research fellow at Australia's Monash University, and Dr. Michael Birnbaum, assistant professor at MIT. Legislative Social Compassion in Legislation calls for Audit of CDFA and Pet Lover's Plate Fund. In the legislative year 2017, in partnership with Social Compassion in Legislation, Dr. Gary Michelson funded, initiated and successfully advanced legislation into law that ended the practice of pet shops sourcing their animals for sale from out of state mills as well as a companion bill that required all pet shops in California that sold cats and dogs to source their animals from local shelters and rescue groups. In the legislative year 2018, in partnership with Social Compassion in Legislation, Dr. Michelson funded and successfully advanced legislation into law to ban the sale in California of cosmetics tested on animals, The California Cruelty-Free Cosmetic Act. In the legislative year 2019, in partnership with Social Compassion in Legislation, Dr. Michelson funded and successfully advanced SB 313, the Circus Cruelty Prevention Act, which bans the use of animals in circus shows in California. In the legislative year 2019, in partnership with Social Compassion in Legislation, Dr. Michelson funded, initiated and successfully achieved the passage of California law AB 1260 which ends the cruel practice of commercial fur trapping, bans the sale of all products made from the hides of exotic animals, and beats back an attempt by outside interests to allow the sale of alligator and crocodile products. Personal life Michelson lives in Los Angeles with his wife Alya, and their three children. In the August 2016 special issue of the Los Angeles Business Journal, Michelson was listed among the 500 most influential people in Los Angeles. In the December 2015 issue of Forbes magazine, Michelson was featured alongside Warren Buffett, William A. Ackman, Michael Milken and Michael J. Fox as one of \\"10 People with Big Ideas to Change the World\\". In December 2018, Michelson appeared on the cover of CSQ C-Suite Quarterly Magazine and was awarded the Visionary of the Year Award in Philanthropy. The award ceremony took place in New York City on February 5, 2019. Michelson was also interviewed on the Positive Phil Podcast about his personal, professional and philanthropical contributions. Michelson was also featured on the Adam Mendler podcast.

The serial is set on the planet Tara, which is made up of a feudal society with electronic weapons and androids. In the serial, Count Grendel of Gracht (Peter Jeffrey) kidnaps Prince Reynart (Neville Jason) and the alien time traveller Romana (Mary Tamm), along with the fourth segment of the powerful Key to Time, as part of his plot to become the legitimate King of Tara. Plot The society of the planet Tara is a mix of the feudal and the futuristic, with a rigid social monarchical hierarchy developed alongside a skill in advanced electronics and android making, a skill reserved to the lesser orders. Centuries earlier, after a plague wiped out nine tenths of the population, the peasants, abandoned by the nobles, began building androids to deal with labour shortages. The planet is now troubled by a struggle for the crown and the power on Tara. The rightful heir, Prince Reynart, is facing a challenge to his rule and coronation from his cousin, Count Grendel of Gracht, a suave but deadly villain who has kidnapped Reynart's sweetheart, the Princess Strella, and is holding her captive to persuade Reynart not to take the throne. The Fourth Doctor and Romana arrive on Tara in search of the fourth segment of the Key to Time. While the Doctor goes fishing, Romana identifies and transforms the fourth segment alone‚Äîit was disguised as a segment of a Grachtian statue. She is attacked by a native Taran bear and only saved by Count Grendel, who takes Romana to his castle on the pretext of treating her injured ankle and \\"registering\\" the Key segment as an exotic gemstone. Once there, it becomes clear that Grendel believes she is an android, because she exactly resembles the captive Strella. Grendel orders her to be disassembled, and just before Romana's head is to be chopped off, Grendel's surgeon/android engineer Madame Lamia realises Romana is real. However, Romana is then imprisoned in Grendel's dungeons like the Princess. Meanwhile, the noble swordsmen Zadek (Simon Lack) and Farrah (Paul Lavers) have recruited the Doctor to assist Prince Reynart. He agrees to help repair an android copy of the Prince, which is to be used as a decoy to help him reach his coronation by diverting the attention of Grendel's men while the real Prince slips into the coronation chamber through a back way. This plot looks plausible, but Grendel strikes first, drugging the Prince and his retinue and kidnapping Reynart himself. When the Doctor and the swordsmen recover they decide to change the original plan and crown the android Reynart instead. The party move through the tunnels beneath the royal castle to get to the throne room so that the android Reynart can be crowned, for if he is not there at the correct moment then he forfeits his claim and the crown may be offered to Grendel. The real Reynart was wounded in his capture and has been imprisoned with Romana to prevent any legitimate succession. The Doctor calls K9 from the TARDIS to provide armed support and scanning intelligence that confirms that the Count has Romana in his castle. The Doctor and his party sneak the android Prince into the throne room, and the coronation begins; but the android is damaged and it is clear the ruse will not hold for long. After the Prince is crowned King, Strella appears, to swear loyalty to the King. Although struck by her resemblance to Romana, the Doctor recognises that she is an android and hits her on the head with the King's sceptre. Shortly afterward, Till, Grendel's manservant, arrives at the Reynart estate and offers the Doctor a chance to collect Romana from the Pavilion of the Summer Winds, a nearby gazebo. It is, however, a trap engineered by Grendel who knows the Doctor is the man who has deprived him of the throne. Grendel has persuaded his android maker Madame Lamia to make another android in the image of Romana that is programmed to kill the Doctor. However, K9 detects the android Romana and eliminates it. While this is happening, the real Romana escapes from Castle Gracht and heads off to find the Doctor. She arrives at the Pavilion in the aftermath of Grendel's attack, which has left Lamia dead, and helps the Doctor flee. The situation is soon reversed; Grendel, coming under a flag of truce to secretly offer the crown to the Doctor, destroys the Reynart android and then recaptures Romana. The evil Count now plots to have Romana pose as Strella and marry the real King Reynart in a shotgun wedding at Castle Gracht. Once they are married and she is his Queen, Reynart will then be killed, leaving Grendel free to marry her immediately afterwards thus ultimately making himself the legitimate King of Tara. The Doctor has K9 assist him to gain access to the castle by means of the moat and tunnels. The Doctor reaches the throne room just in time to stop Reynart's coerced marriage to Romana. He then engages the Count in a deadly duel with electro-swords, eventually defeating him and forcing him to flee. Romana has meanwhile freed Strella who is finally reunited with Reynart. Having retrieved the fourth segment of the Key to Time, the Doctor, Romana and K9 depart. Production Mary Tamm designed Romana's distinctive purple outfit after the originally planned costume proved unsuitable.DVD commentary Although Tamm was a skilled horse-rider, she refused to do the horse-riding sequence herself because she could not wear a helmet and felt that the potential of an accident was too great. Location work was performed at Leeds Castle, Kent. In the opening credits, the episode number appears before the writer's name, contrary to the order in most Doctor Who stories. =Cast notes= Mary Tamm plays four roles in this story: Romana, Princess Strella and their android doubles. Peter Jeffrey previously played the colony pilot in The Macra Terror (1967). Declan Mulholland previously played Clark in The Sea Devils (1972). This is Cyril Shaps's fourth and final appearance in Doctor Who, the others being The Tomb of the Cybermen (1967), The Ambassadors of Death (1970) and Planet of the Spiders (1974). It is his only appearance in which his character is not killed. Simon Lack had previously appeared as Professor Kettering in The Mind of Evil (1971). Broadcast and reception The story was repeated on four consecutive Thursdays on BBC1 from 9‚Äì30 August 1979, achieving viewing figures of 6.2, 10.4, 10.4 and 9.6 million, respectively. The rise in figures is attributable to the ITV strike, which would continue into the seventeenth season of Doctor Who. In their book The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping described The Androids of Tara as \\"Wonderful, Doctor Who as heroic romance, with plenty of swashbuckling, wit and colour.\\" They particularly praised the Doctor's duel at the end and the small stakes. On the other hand, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker in The Television Companion (1998) felt that the story relied on The Prisoner of Zenda, which made it \\"rather less engaging than the other stories of the season, coming over more as a gentle run-around than as anything particularly significant\\". They praised the premise, but wrote that there was a lack of suspense and the characters were bland, with the exception of Grendel. DVD Talk's Justin Felix agreed, writing that \\"its whimsical nature makes this episode feel more like an excursion than an advancement of the season's storyline\\" and described the story as \\"a competent albeit standard runaround\\". However, he praised Baker and the development of Romana's character. Felix gave the story three out of five stars. In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times praised the acting and direction, but stated that it \\"strays too far into the 'adventure serial' territory\\" and lacked a sense of \\"real urgency or jeopardy\\".

Accession and civil war  A son of the Georgian king David VI Narin and his wife, Tamar Amanelisdze, or a Palaeologian princess. Constantine succeeded to the throne of Imereti upon his father's death in 1293. Unlike his eastern Georgian counterparts, Constantine remained independent from the Ilkhanid hegemony, but he faced serious internal unrest as his younger brother Michael opposed his accession and seized control of the regions of Racha, Lechkhumi, and Argveti. In vain did the nobles of Imereti try to reconcile the brothers and internecine conflict continued to upset the country. The great nobles took advantage of the situation to assert their autonomy. Giorgi I Dadiani, Duke of Mingrelia, subjugated much of the duchy of Tskhumi and expanded his possessions up to Anacopia. The Shervashidze entrenched in Abkhazia, the Gurieli in Guria, and Vardanidze in Svaneti, showing little subservience to the royal authority. Constantine died amid these disturbances in 1327, having had no children, and his brother Michael succeeded him as king.  Culture  Constantine is known to have restored Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem to the Georgian ownership in 1305. He also had the monastery refurbished and repainted. His contributions are emphasized in a document instituting the Agape feast, in his own lifetime, on 21 May, the feast day of Constantine the Great.

The art work consisted of a 120-foot-long, 12-foot-high solid, unfinished plate of rust-covered COR-TEN steel. Advocates characterized it as an important work by a well-known artist that transformed the space and advanced the concept of sculpture, whereas critics focused on its perceived ugliness and saw it as ruining the site. Following an acrimonious public debate, the sculpture was removed in 1989 as the result of a Federal lawsuit and has never been publicly displayed since, in accordance with the artist's wishes. Commissioning and design In 1979, the United States General Services Administration Art-in-Architecture program decided to commission a work of public art to grace the open space in front of a planned addition to the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building in Manhattan, New York City.Kammen, p.238Michalos, p.179 Taking the recommendation of a National Endowment for the Arts panel of art experts, the U.S. General Services Administration administrator gave the commission to sculptor Richard Serra,Kammen a fine-arts graduate of Yale University who at age 40 was one of the leading minimalist sculptors.Bresler, p.195. The contract for the commission required Serra to give the work to GSA, making it property of the United States.Kammen, p.196 The post-minimalist artwork was designed and constructed in 1981.Hopkins, p.159 Exemplifying Serra's minimalist, conceptual style, Tilted Arc was a solid, unfinished plate of COR-TEN steel, long, tall, and thick.Kammen, p.239 As its name suggests, it was slightly tilted. Placed in the Federal Plaza, the work bisected the space, blocking views and paths of those who frequented the plaza. Serra said of the design, \\"The viewer becomes aware of himself and of his movement through the plaza. As he moves, the sculpture changes. Contraction and expansion of the sculpture result from the viewer's movement. Step by step, the perception not only of the sculpture but of the entire environment changes.\\" The steel is self-oxidizing and is designed to develop a natural rusted appearance over time. For Serra, an important part of the work's meaning was that it would interact with the commuter passing through the plaza, a location usually passed through quickly on the way to somewhere else. This would subsequently become important as the basis for Serra's designation of the work as site-specific.  Reactions  Commissioned in 1979, Tilted Arc immediately attracted intense negative feedback, prominently from Chief Judge Edward D. Re, as well as fierce defenders. Those who worked in the area found the sculpture extremely disruptive to their daily routines, and within months the work had driven over 1300 government employees in the greater metro area to sign a petition for its removal. Serra, however, wrote, \\"It is a site-specific work and as such is not to be relocated. To remove the work is to destroy the work.\\" Serra's side argued that Tilted Arc was designed to be counterintuitive, to \\"redefine\\" the space in which it existed, and that due to this intimate relationship between the location and the meaning of the work, it could not exist as a piece of humane art unless it remained in that exact location within the Foley Plaza. Therefore, it was said that by removing the physical steel sculpture, the government would destroy the broader work, regardless of its physical existence.Kammen, p.241 Opponents countered that, because the sculpture forced the site to function as an extension of the sculpture, it was in effect \\"holding the site hostage.\\" Calvin Tomkins, an art critic for The New Yorker magazine, was quoted saying, \\"I think it is perfectly legitimate to question whether public spaces and public funds are the right context for work that appeals to so few people - no matter how far it advances the concept of sculpture.\\" Sociologist Nathan Glazer, writing in The Public Interest, declared that Serra was ‚Äúattacking the awful by increasing the awfulness. To the misery of working in an ugly and poorly designed building, it was Serra‚Äôs thought to add additional misery in the form of a sculpture that was ugly to most people‚Ä¶ that obstructed the plaza, that offered no space to sit on, that blocked sun and view, and made the plaza unusable even for those moments of freedom when the weather permitted office workers to eat their lunch outside.‚ÄùGlazer, Nathan. \\"Subverting the Context\\": Public Space and Public Design in The Public Interest, No. 109 Fall 1992. pp. 3‚Äì21 The Storefront for Art and Architecture invited prominent NYC artists and architects to envision the future plaza as a protest in \\"After Tilted Arc\\". A public hearing was held on the subject of the sculpture in March 1985, with 122 people testifying in favor of keeping the piece and 58 in favor of removing it. Notable speakers arguing in favor of the sculpture included Philip Glass, Keith Haring, and Claes Oldenburg. Artists, art historians, and even a psychiatrist testified for the sculpture to remain in its location.Michalos, p.180 Local workers argued for removal, with one person saying: \\"Every time I pass this so-called sculpture I just can‚Äôt believe it ... The General Services Administration, or whoever approved this, this goes beyond the realm of stupidity. This goes into even worse than insanity. I think an insane person would say, ‚ÄòHow crazy can you be to pay $175,000 for that rusted metal wall?' You would have to be insane‚Äî more than insane.\\" In support of its removal of the sculpture, the government advanced multiple security arguments, claiming that allowing the sculpture to remain in the plaza would \\"run the risk of deflecting explosions into government buildings opposite and impeded adequate surveillance of the area beyond.\\" A jury of five voted 4‚Äì1 to remove the sculpture. In 1986, Serra sued the United States General Services Administration to enjoin the removal of \\"Tilted Arc,\\" launching the lawsuit considered the most notorious public sculpture controversy in the history of art law.  Trial  Serra's complaint against the United States General Services Office sought to enjoin the office from violating an oral agreement not to remove the sculpture from Federal Plaza.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/667/1042/2158507/ Serra also claimed that the removal of \\"Tilted Arc\\" constituted a violation of his First Amendment right to free speech and Fifth Amendment right to due process.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/667/1042/2158507/ The federal district court rejected all three of Serra's claims, and Serra appealed his constitutional claims to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On the First Amendment claim, the court of appeals ruled that while \\"Tilted Arc\\" was first amendment speech, the government's legal ownership of the sculpture made it government speech subject to the government's discretion. Even if Serra did retain a free speech interest in \\"Tilted Arc,\\" the government's interest in keeping the plaza unobstructed constituted a permissible, content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction on free speech.https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/667/1042/2158507/ The court further determined that Serra did not retain a property interest in the sculpture, since it was indeed signed over to the government upon commission, and therefore did not have a Fifth Amendment due process claim. https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district- courts/FSupp/667/1042/2158507/  Aftermath  Tilted Arc was stored in three sections stacked in a government parking lot in Brooklyn upon removal from the plaza. In 1999, they were moved to a storage space in Maryland. Although the physical component of the work is safe in storage, it will likely never again be erected since it is Serra's wish that it will never be displayed anywhere other than its original location.Michalos, p.182 Serra has stated that the case exemplifies the U.S. legal system's preference towards capitalistic property rights over democratic freedom of expression.Serra, p.185  Influence  The Tilted Arc controversy may have contributed to the enactment, in 1990, of the Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA). An amendment to the Copyright Act of 1976, VARA provides \\"moral rights\\" to the artist so that they have rights to attribution and integrity when it comes to paintings, drawings, and sculpture.Bresler, p.201 However, a 2006 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals established that VARA does not protect location as a component of site-specific work. William Gaddis satirized these events in his 1994 novel, A Frolic of His Own. See also * Joel Wachs, Los Angeles City Council member on the committee who recommended what to do with the art piece.

Life and career Star was born in Bavaria, Germany, to Jewish parents. When he was 10 years of age, his family moved to Chillicothe, Ohio. He later moved to Helena, Montana, where he served as territorial auditor and personal secretary to the governor. He partnered with Seth Bullock in a hardware store; in August 1876, attracted to Deadwood by the promise of a great deal of business stemming from the gold rush, they purchased a lot there from Al Swearengen and Henry Beaman, and opened the Office of Star and Bullock, Auctioneers and Commission Merchants. They later partnered in livestock ranching as the S&B; Ranch Company, and with Harris Franklin in the Deadwood Flouring Mill, in 1880, where Star was the general manager. The duo expanded their business interests to the towns of Spearfish, Sturgis, and Custer. Bullock and Star contributed further to the economic development of the region by convincing the Fremont, Elkhorn, and Missouri Valley Railroad to build a track, by offering them 40 acres (162,000 m¬≤) of free right-of-way across their land when a speculator purchased the right of way to Minnesela and demanded a high price from the railroad. The railroad built a station three miles northwest of Minnesela, South Dakota, in 1890, and Bullock and Star were instrumental in founding the town of Belle Fourche there, offering free lots to anyone moving from Minnesela. Belle Fourche became the largest railhead for livestock in the United States and stole the county seat away from a declining Minnesela. Bullock and Star's hardware store in Deadwood burned down in 1894. Rather than rebuild, they built Deadwood's first hotel on the site, a three-story, 64-room luxury hotel with steam heat and indoor bathrooms on each floor, at a cost of $40,000. The Bullock Hotel continues to operate to this day, now incorporating a 24-hour casino. Star was elected to the first town council in 1876, became town postmaster in 1877, was elected mayor in 1884, and served ten terms for a total of 14 years. He later served as a Republican legislator after statehood in the South Dakota House of Representatives in 1889‚Äì1890 and in the South Dakota State Senate in 1893‚Äì1894 serving as President Pro Tempore of the South Dakota Senate,South Dakota Legislature-Historical Listing-Legislator Information and as Lawrence County Clerk of Courts for 20 years, until his death. He was never married. After a reportedly lavish funeral in Deadwood, Star was not buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in Deadwood. Instead, his family had his body transported to St. Louis, Missouri, where he was laid to rest in New Mount Sinai Cemetery. In popular culture Star was portrayed by John Hawkes in the television series Deadwood (2004‚Äì2006). The show's producers switched the character's birthplace to Vienna instead of Bavaria. Hawkes reprised his role in the television film Deadwood: The Movie (2019), set a decade after the events of season 3.

Digenes Akrites (, ), known in folksongs as Digenes Akritas (, ) and also transliterated as Digenis Acritis, is the most famous of the Acritic Songs. The epic details the life of the hero, Basil (ŒíŒ±œÉŒØŒªŒµŒπŒøœÇ), whose epithet Digenes Akritas (\\"Two Blood Border Lord\\" or \\"Twain-born Borderer\\") refers to his mixed Byzantine- Cappadocian Greek and Arab blood. The first part of the epic details the lives of his parents, how they met, and how his father, an Emir, converted to Christianity after abducting and marrying Digenes' mother. The remainder of the epic discusses, often from a first-person point of view, Basil's acts of heroism on the Byzantine border.  Manuscript  The Digenes Akrites is an extensive narrative text, although it is not in a pure epic-heroic style. No fewer than six manuscripts have been found dedicated to stories about him.Jeffreys (1998): p. xv The oldest two are el Escorial (or E, 1867 lines) and Grottaferrata versions (or G, 3749 lines), from the names of the libraries in which the respective manuscripts are held. While the form (or forms) in which it has survived is not the product of oral composition, it has nevertheless retained a considerable number of features of its oral origins. The common core of the two versions preserved in the E and G manuscripts goes back to the twelfth century. The text of E appears to be closer to the original composition while G represents a version that is heavily marked by learned reworking. Both texts give enchanting descriptions of the life of the martial societies of the border regions of the empire, while in the figure of Digenes are concentrated the legends that had accumulated around local heroes. El Escorial version is the superior of the two in respect of the power and immediacy of the battle scenes and austerity of style. The epic descriptions of the mounted knights and battles are marked by drama, a swift pace and lively visual detail.  Storyline  Digenes Akritas and the dragon. 13th century Byzantine dish. The Arab‚ÄìByzantine wars that lasted from the seventh century to the early 11th century provide the context for Byzantine heroic poetry written in Medieval Greek. The Akritai of the Byzantine Empire of this period were a military class responsible for safeguarding the frontier regions of the imperial territory from external enemies and freebooting adventurers who operated on the fringes of the empire. The work comprises two parts. In the first, the \\"Lay of the Emir\\", which bears more obviously the characteristics of epic poetry, an Arab amir invades Cappadocia and carries off the daughter of a Byzantine general. The emir agrees to convert to Christianity for the sake of the daughter and resettles in the Byzantine Empire ( Roman√≠a, the lands of the Œ°œâŒºŒ∑ŒøŒØ Romioi) together with his people. The issue of their union is a son, Digenes Akritas. The second part of the work relates the development of the young hero and his superhuman feats of bravery and strength. As a boy, he goes hunting with his father and kills two bears unarmed, strangling the first to death and breaking the second one's spine. He also tears a hind in half with his bare hands, and slays a lion in the same manner. Like his father, he carries off the daughter of another Byzantine general and then marries her; he kills a dragon; he takes on the so- called apel√°tai (), a group of bandits, and then defeats their three leaders in single combat. No one, not even the amazingly strong female warrior Maximu, with whom he commits the sin of adultery, can match him. Having defeated all his enemies Digenes builds a luxurious palace by the Euphrates, where he ends his days peacefully. Cypriot legend has it that he grabbed hold of the Pentadaktylos (\\"Five Fingers\\") mountain range north of Nicosia in order to leap to Anatolia. The mountain range, as the name suggests, resembles five knuckles sprouting from the ground. The tale of Digenes continued to be read and enjoyed in later centuries, as the text survives in various versions dating to as late as the 17th century. The epic tale of Digenes Akritas corresponds in many ways to a cycle of much shorter Acritic songs, particularly from Anatolia, Cyprus and Crete, some of which survive until the present day. In the later tradition Digenes is eventually defeated only by Death, in the figure of Thanatos/Charon, after fierce single combat on \\"the marble threshing floors\\". Thanatos had reportedly already wrestled with Heracles. The Greek-Canadian composer Christos Hatzis has used this text as the basis for a portion of his \\"Constantinople\\". The story of Digenes Akritas, defeated by Death personally, was used as a basis of a Russian bylina (a folk ballad) about Anika the Warrior.–≠–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –∞—Ä—Ñ–∞: –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏—è –±–∞–ª–ª–∞–¥—ã, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, \\"–í—ã—Å—à–∞—è —à–∫–æ–ª–∞\\", 1989, , page 625  Form  Digenes Akritas and the dragon. 12th century Byzantine dish.

As of 2015, she has been the commissioner of Japanese promotion World Wonder Ring Stardom. In professional wrestling Miceli is also known by the ring name Alundra Blayze, which she used while in the WWF/WWE. Outside of the WWF, she wrestled under her professional name of Madusa, which was shortened from \\"Made in the USA\\". Her early career was spent in the American Wrestling Association, where she once held the AWA World Women's Championship. In 1988, she was the first woman to be awarded Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Rookie of the Year. The following year, she signed a contract with All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling, making her the first foreign wrestler to do so. She later joined World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where she was a member of The Dangerous Alliance, a group of wrestlers managed by Paul E. Dangerously. In 1993, she joined the rival World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the name Alundra Blayze. In the WWF, she feuded with Bull Nakano and Bertha Faye, while holding the WWF Women's Championship three times. Two years after joining the WWF, Miceli returned to WCW, showing up on an episode of Monday Nitro to throw the WWF Women's Championship belt into a trash can; she was blacklisted by the WWF for the next 20 years as a result. In her second WCW run, Miceli feuded with Bull Nakano and Oklahoma, and became the first woman to hold the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. After training wrestlers such as Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, and Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) at the WCW Power Plant, she left the company in 2001. On March 28, 2015, she was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, under the Alundra Blayze moniker. Miceli competes in the world of monster trucks. She drives a truck named Madusa, and won the 2004 co-championship at the Monster Jam World Finals for freestyle in the first-ever three-way tie. The following year, she was the only female competitor in the Super Bowl of Motorsports, and she won the Racing Championship in the Monster Jam World Finals.  Professional wrestling career  = American Wrestling Association (1986-1989) = In 1984, Miceli trained with Eddie Sharkey in Minneapolis and began working on the independent circuit for $5 a match. In 1986, she started wrestling in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) feuding with Sherri Martel as Madusa Miceli. After Martel left the AWA, she replaced her as \\"Mr. Magnificent\\" Kevin Kelly's manager, who often teamed with Nick Kiniski as \\"The Perfect Tag Team\\". In a tournament final, she won the AWA World Women's Championship over Candi Devine on December 27, 1987. At that time Madusa also began managing the AWA World Heavyweight Champion Curt Hennig. She later lost the title to Wendi Richter on November 26, 1988. Hennig and Madusa joined the Diamond Exchange, a stable led by Diamond Dallas Page that included Badd Company. With Badd Company she faced the team of the Top Guns (Ricky Rice and Derrick Dukes) and Wendi Richter at the only AWA pay-per-view SuperClash III. Both Badd Company's Tag-Team Title and Wendi Richter's AWA World Women's Championship were on the line, but since Richter pinned Miceli, Badd Company remained the champions. In 1988, Miceli was also the first woman to be awarded Pro Wrestling Illustrated's Rookie of the Year. = All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling (1989-1991) = Miceli wrestled a six-week tour for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling at the beginning of 1989, where she won the IWA Women's title from Chigusa Nagayo before dropping it back to her the very next day. She then began training in Japan, learning the Japanese wrestling style, as well as Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing. She eventually signed a three-year deal with All Japan, which made her the first non-Japanese wrestler to do so. In addition, she worked for the TWA, feuding with Luna Vachon, whom she faced in a Hair vs Hair Mixed Tag Team match in September 1991. Miceli and her partner Eddie Gilbert defeated Vachon and Cactus Jack, which resulted in Vachon having her head shaved. = World Championship Wrestling (1991-1993) = She then went to WCW and helped Paul E. Dangerously form his Dangerous Alliance. She acted primarily as Alliance member Rick Rude's valet. On October 25, Dangerously kicked her out of the Dangerous Alliance at Halloween Havoc. She, however, defeated him by count-out on November 18, 1992 at Clash of the Champions XXI. = World Wrestling Federation (1993-1995) = Women's Champion in June 1995 In 1993, the WWF reinstated its Women's Championship, a title that had been vacant since 1990, and Miceli was brought in by the company to revive the women's division. She debuted under the ring name Alundra Blayze, because WWF owner Vince McMahon did not want to pay Miceli to use the name Madusa, which she had trademarked. She wrestled in a six-woman tournament to crown a new Women's Champion, and in the finals, she pinned Heidi Lee Morgan on December 13 to win the title. After the tournament, Miceli asked WWF management to bring in new women for her to wrestle. In mid-1994, Bull Nakano joined the WWF roster and began feuding with Blayze. Blayze defeated Nakano at SummerSlam, but lost the belt to her on November 20, 1994 in Japan at the Big Egg Wrestling Universe event. Five months later on April 3, 1995, Blayze regained the title from Nakano on an edition of Monday Night Raw. As part of the storyline, immediately following the win, she was attacked by Bertha Faye, who broke her nose. According to Rhonda Sing (Faye), the storyline was written so Miceli could take time off to get breast implants and a nose job. She returned to the ring in August 1995, losing the Women's Championship to Faye at SummerSlam on August 27. Two months later, she won the title a third time, defeating Faye on October 23. In December, due to financial troubles the WWF was having at the time she was released from her contract and was stripped of the title following her jump to rival company World Championship Wrestling, and the WWF Women's Championship remained vacant until 1998. Miceli was blacklisted by the WWF for the next 20 years, owing to her participation in a controversial incident upon returning to WCW during which she dropped the WWF Women's Championship Title Belt into a trash can. = Return to WCW (1995‚Äì2001) = In December 1995 Miceli signed with WCW, and as part of a storyline by booker Eric Bischoff, showed up on WCW Monday Nitro on December 18, where she threw the WWF Women's Title belt into a trash can. She later admitted that she regretted the action and would not have done it had Bischoff not coerced her. Miceli immediately began using the Madusa name again. Upon her debut she attacked Sherri Martel during her wedding to Col. Robert Parker. She had a match the following Monday on Nitro against Sherri Martel which she lost. After that, the company brought in Bull Nakano to feud with her; they battled in a match at Hog Wild in August 1996. Due to pre-match stipulations, Madusa was allowed to destroy Nakano's motorcycle after the match. The company then decided to establish the WCW Women's Championship, but Madusa lost to Akira Hokuto in the finals of the tournament to crown the first champion on December 29 at Starrcade. On June 15, Hokuto retained the title against Madusa at The Great American Bash in a Title vs. Career match. The latter then took a nearly two-year hiatus from the company. Madusa returned to WCW in April 1999 as part of Randy Savage's faction Team Madness with Gorgeous George and Miss Madness. After that storyline ended, Madusa entered into a tournament for the WCW Championship, but she was defeated and eliminated from the tournament. She was later re- entered into the tournament in a match against Evan Karagias, but was eliminated the next week. After her elimination, Madusa put all her focus on managing Karagias. After Karagias won the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship at Mayhem, he was found flirting with Spice of the Nitro Girls. At Starrcade, however, Spice gave Karagias a low blow during the match, and Madusa pinned him to become the first female ever to win the WCW World Cruiserweight Championship. Spice then aligned herself with Madusa and became her manager for a short time. In January 2000, Madusa developed a rivalry with Oklahoma. In a farcical Evening Gown match on an episode of WCW Thunder on January 12, Madusa defeated Oklahoma by stripping off his dress, but he attacked her after the match. She eventually lost the Cruiserweight belt to Oklahoma at Souled Out on January 16, 2000. In the meantime, Miceli became an instructor at the WCW Power Plant, where she helped train women such as Nora Greenwald (Molly Holly) to wrestle. Before WCW's collapse, she engaged in a brief feud with Torrie Wilson and Shane Douglas, who defeated her and partner Billy Kidman at Fall Brawl in a Mixed Tag Team Scaffold match. Madusa took a big bump during this match and wasn't seen again on WCW TV. She left the company when she heard that Vince McMahon, the owner of the World Wrestling Federation, was going to buy WCW. Because she had a previous falling-out with McMahon, she opted not to stay with the company. She retired from professional wrestling for good in 2001 because she did not like the direction in which women's wrestling was going; according to her, it was becoming less about real wrestling and more about Bra and Panties matches. = Return to WWE = Hall of Fame (2015) On March 2, 2015, it was announced that Miceli would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2015, under her Alundra Blayze moniker. On Twitter, she said this was a sign of respect, since that was her name in WWE, but \\"that bitch Madusa will be on stage speaking.\\"@Madusa_rocks on Twitter, 6:40 PM - 24 Mar 2015 During her speech, in response to constant questions about her dumping the WWF Women's Championship belt in the trash on Monday Nitro, her inductor, Natalya, wheeled a trash can onstage.

On January 27, 2016, Miceli appeared on WWE Network's program Table for 3, along with fellow wrestlers Ivory and Molly Holly. In September 2017, the WWE Network released a documentary entitled \\"TrailBlayzer\\" detailing Miceli's careers in both wrestling and monster truck driving. Miceli as Alundra Blayze was announced as an entrant into the battle royal for a women's championship opportunity at WWE Evolution, marking a return to the ring after an 18-year hiatus, however she was eliminated by Nia Jaxhttps://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2018/10/wwe-evolution-live- results-647230/ On July 22, 2019, Alundra Blayze appeared as a heel and attacked 24/7 Champion Candice Michelle, after which she captured the title from Candice by forcing her to submit, with Melina acting as the official, becoming the third woman to win the title, while also becoming the first individual to win the title via submission. She also became the second woman to hold both the WWE Women's Championship, and the 24/7 Championship. She later attempted to toss the 24/7 Championship into the trash (similar to when she did the same to the WWF Women's Championship in 1995), only to instead sell the title to WWE Hall of Famer Ted DiBiase. = World Wonder Ring Stardom (2015‚Äìpresent) = In September 2015, Miceli was appointed the commissioner of Japanese women's promotion World Wonder Ring Stardom. = All Elite Wrestling (2020) = Miceli was presenter of the All Elite Wrestling (AEW)'s Women's Tag Team Cup Tournament: The Deadly Draw, which began on August 3, 2020.

The truck is stopped, balanced on its rear end Miceli's monster truck in 2006 Miceli entered the monster truck business under Dennis Anderson in 1999. She made her first American hot rod appearance at the Trans World Dome. Afterward, she purchased her own truck and named it Madusa, as she still held the rights to the name. She began winning freestyle competitions in 2001. Miceli won the 2004 co-championship at the Monster Jam World Finals for freestyle in the first-ever three-way tie. In March 2005 in Las Vegas, she beat her trainer Dennis Anderson in the final bracket of the Monster Jam World Finals for the Racing Championship, thus making her the first woman to win the Monster Jam World Finals racing championship. Also in 2005, she was the only female competitor in the Super Bowl of Motorsports. As of January 2008, she is also the Executive Vice President of the Major League of Monster Trucks. In 2009, she returned to Monster Jam for the first time since 2006. On October 10, 2014, she was injured in a Monster Jam event in Melbourne, Australia and was taken to a Melbourne hospital for treatment.Former Wcw & Wwf Star Madusa Hospitalized  Pwinsider.Com  Other media  She appeared in the video game WCW Nitro, WCW Backstage Assault, WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17, WWE 2K18 and WWE 2K19.  Personal life  Miceli was born in Milan, Italy, but raised in several foster homes in Minneapolis. She is Jewish, but celebrates Christmas. Before entering professional wrestling, she participated in both gymnastics and track, and at age 14, she worked at an Arby's fast-food restaurant. During the beginning of her wrestling career, she also worked as a part-time nurse. Her first marriage was in June 1997, she met NFL player Ken Blackman, and they married seven months later on February 14, 1998. They shared homes in Cincinnati and Homosassa, Florida. In 1998, they opened a motorcycle shop called Spookee Custom Cycles, which made motorcycles for other NFL players such as Kimo von Oelhoffen, Darnay Scott, Bradford Banta, and Dan Wilkinson. The couple later divorced. On June 25, 2011, Miceli married Alan Jonason, a Sergeant Major in the United States Army, in Memphis, Tennessee. The wedding took place at Graceland, and was broadcast over the internet for over 22,000 fans. In 1995, she appeared in the films Shootfighter II, Death Match, and Intersanction II. In Japan, she released a CD of songs sung in Japanese. She owns a grooming, pet spa, and doggy bakery called Koolkats and Hotdogs in Lecanto, Florida.

Known as Massachusetts Avenue, the highway runs from MD 614 southeast to Westmoreland Circle near the District of Columbia boundary in Bethesda. MD 396 is an extension of Washington's Massachusetts Avenue into southwestern Montgomery County. The highway was constructed from Westmoreland Circle to Glen Echo in the early to mid-1930s. MD 396 was rolled back to its present western terminus in favor of MD 614 in the late 1970s. Route description View west at the east end of MD 396 at the District of Columbia border in Bethesda MD 396 begins at an intersection with MD 614 (Goldsboro Road) on the edge of Bethesda near Glen Echo. The highway heads southeast as a two-lane undivided road that widens to four lanes at Sangamore Road. Just east of its underpass of the Capital Crescent Trail, MD 396 meets the southern end of Little Falls Parkway and crosses Little Falls Branch. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at its entrance to Westmoreland Circle, which straddles the District of Columbia boundary and whose Maryland half is unsigned MD 396A. Massachusetts Avenue continues southeast through Washington on the opposite side of the circle. History MD 396 was constructed as a concrete road along a new alignment from Westmoreland Circle to just west of the Georgetown Branch of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and Little Falls between 1931 and 1933. The Georgetown Branch's bridge across the highway, which is now used by the Capital Crescent Trail, was constructed at the same time as the highway. MD 396 was extended west to Goldsboro Road, then west along Goldsboro Road to what is now MacArthur Boulevard, in 1934 and 1935. The Goldsboro Road segment of MD 396 became a western extension of MD 614 in 1978. The MD 396-MD 614 intersection was originally a wye; the junction was changed to its current T intersection by 1999.

The serial is set on the third moon of the human colony world Delta Magna. In the serial, a methane catalysing refinery's operations in the swamp disturbs the giant squid Kroll, which grew in size after ingesting the fifth segment of the powerful Key to Time. When Kroll surfaces, it subsequently rampages on the moon. Plot The Fourth Doctor and Romana have arrived on the third moon of Delta Magna, searching for the penultimate segment of the Key to Time. They find themselves caught in the middle of a dispute between the crew of a methane refinery and the natives (known as 'Swampies'). The Swampies claim that the crew have disturbed the waters, and will incur the wrath of their god, Kroll. Kroll is revealed to be a giant squid which surfaces to feed every few centuries and is the source of the abnormally large amount of methane being mined. Originally a normal size squid, Kroll ingested the fifth segment of the Key to Time and began to grow, becoming a god-like figure to the Swampies and their descendants. After Kroll awakens and begins to attack both the Swampies and the refinery indiscriminately, the Doctor uses the tracer to retrieve the segment of the Key, which destroys Kroll and instigates cellular regeneration within the creature to produce hundreds of normal-sized squid. This process not only saves the planet's inhabitants but removes the source of methane from the refinery. The Doctor and Romana return to the TARDIS and set off on their next adventure. Production When script editor Anthony Read asked Robert Holmes to write the story, there were two requirements: that it include the largest monster in series history and that Holmes minimise the humour that many scripts from the era were known for. This second requirement was a request from higher up at the BBC. Early titles for the story were Moon of Death and Horror of the Swamp. Holmes said that he considered the idea of a large monster a mistake given the budgetary constraints at the BBC and named The Power of Kroll as his least favourite Doctor Who story. Extensive location filming took place in Snape, Suffolk around the River Alde from Monday 18 September 1978 to represent the marshes featured in the script. Nine days of location filming were afforded to the serial, including two night shoots, more than is usual for a Doctor Who story. Studio sequences were taped during October 1978.The Power of Kroll DVD Production notes, BBC DVD, 2007 The serial was directed by Norman Stewart, who had directed the Underworld story a year previously. This was his final assignment on the programme. The actors playing Swampies were coloured green with a special water-resistant dye ordered from Germany. Unfortunately, the make-up artist failed to order the special dye remover, with the result that many of the actors had to take chemical baths to get the green dye off, and many had a green tint for a long period after production was finished. Costume designer Colin Lavers introduced a new tweed coat for the Doctor, which sported four flying duck brooches on its lapels. Around this time, producer Graham Williams fell ill and his duties were taken on by Anthony Read and production unit manager John Nathan-Turner, assisted by Blake's 7 producer David Maloney.Doctor Who Magazine #312, 9 January 2002, \\"Archive: The Power of Kroll\\" by Andrew Pixley, Panini Publishing Ltd. =Cast notes= Among the cast were a number of actors who had previously appeared in Doctor Who playing other characters. The most notable of these was Philip Madoc who had previously appeared in The Krotons (1968‚Äì69), The War Games (1969) and The Brain of Morbius (1976). He had initially been invited to play Thawn, but the role was given to George Baker, who then pulled out. Madoc agreed to play the part of Fenner when Alan Browning, who was slated to play Fenner, fell ill before the start of production, but was dissatisfied with the role. John Leeson, best known as the voice of K9, appears in this story as Dugeen. This is his only on-screen appearance in Doctor Who and was given the role due to the fact that K9 doesn't appear in this story. (The role had previously been offered to Martin Jarvis.) Neil McCarthy previously played Barnham in The Mind of Evil (1971), while John Abineri previously played Van Lutyens in Fury from the Deep (1968), General Carrington in The Ambassadors of Death (1970) and Richard Railton in Death to the Daleks (1974). Broadcast and reception Part One was broadcast only a few hours after BBC1 had come back on-air following a strike. The channel had ceased transmitting programmes after the early evening news on Wednesday 20 December and the dispute was resolved in time for services to resume at 3pm on Saturday 23 December. (BBC2 had been similarly affected, and BBC Radio operated a reduced service.) This disruption accounts for the large drop in ratings compared with the preceding episode, Part Four of The Androids of Tara, which was watched by 9m viewers. By contrast Part Two of The Power of Kroll aired during the week between Christmas and New Year, when viewing figures are often higher, and was watched by nearly twice as many people as Part One: BBC ratings were also boosted by a strike which had taken the Yorkshire region of ITV off-air for the entire Christmas period. In their book The Discontinuity Guide (1995), Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote that The Power of Kroll was \\"very slow\\" with little humour, and \\"horribly acted\\" aside from Madoc and Abineri. They also criticised the \\"unconvincing\\" realisation of Kroll. In 2011, Mark Braxton of Radio Times gave a negative review of the serial, describing it as uninteresting with poor effects, \\"tepid dialogue and dull characters\\". However, he felt that some parts were \\"enlivened by Tom Baker's sprightly performance\\". DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave the story two and a half out of five stars, calling it the \\"least inspired\\" story of The Key to Time. While he praised Baker and Tamm and their dialogue, he criticised the \\"flimsy\\" concept and the Swampies.

Young Chapman & Hall There are a limited number of these active sites at any moment during the polymerization which gives this method its key characteristics.  Introduction  An example of chain-growth polymerization by ring opening to polycaprolactone In 1953, Paul Flory first classified polymerization as ‚Äústep-growth polymerization‚Äù and ‚Äúchain-growth polymerization‚Äù. IUPAC recommend to further simplified ‚Äúchain- growth polymerization‚Äù to ‚Äúchain polymerization‚Äù. It is a kind polymerization where an active center (free radical or ion) is formed, and a plurality of monomers can be polymerized together in a short period of time to form a macromolecule having a large molecular weight. In addition to the regenerated active sites of each monomer unit, polymer growth will only occur at one (or possibly more) endpoint. Many common polymers can be obtained by chain polymerization such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate. Typically, chain-growth polymerization can be understood with the chemical equation: : P_x* + M \\\\rightarrow P_{x+1} + L (x=1,2,3...) In this equation, P is the polymer while x represents degree of polymerization, * means active center of chain-growth polymerization, M is the monomer which will react with active center, L is a low-molar-mass by-product obtained during chain propagation. Usually, for chain-growth polymerization, there is no by-product formed. However, there are still some exceptions. For example, amino acid N-carboxy anhydrides polymerizing to oxazolidine-2,5-diones. Steps of chain- growth polymerization Typically, chain polymerization must contain chain initiation and chain propagation. Chain transfer and chain termination do not always happen in a chain-growth polymerization. = Chain initiation = Chain initiation is the process of initially generating a chain carrier (chain carriers are some intermediates such as radical and ions in chain propagation process) in a chain polymerization. According to different ways of energy dissipation, it can be divided into thermal initiation, high energy initiation, and chemical initiation, etc. Thermal initiation is a process that obtained energy and dissociated to homolytic cleavage to form active center by molecular thermal motion. High energy initiation refers to the generation of chain carriers by radiation. Chemical initiation is due to chemical initiator. = Chain propagation = IUPAC defined chain propagation as an active center on the growing polymer molecule, which adds one monomer molecule to form a new polymer molecule which is one repeat unit longer with a new active center. = Chain transfer = 440x440px The polymerization process does not have to undergo chain transfer. Chain transfer means that in a chain polymerization, the active center of the polymer A takes an atom from B molecule and terminates. The B molecule produces a new active center instead. It can happen in free radical polymerization, ionic polymerization and coordination polymerization. Generally, chain transfer will generate by-product and in most of cases decreases molar mass of prepared polymer. = Chain termination = Chain termination refers to in chain polymerization process, active center disappears, resulting in the termination of chain propagation. It is different from chain transfer. During the chain transfer process, the active point only shifts to another molecule but does not disappear.  Classes of chain-growth polymerization  = Radical polymerization = Based on definition from IUPAC, radical polymerization is a chain polymerization in which the kinetic- chain carriers are radicals. Usually, the growing chain end bears an unpaired electron. Free radicals can be initiated by many methods such as heating, redox reactions, ultraviolet radiation, high energy irradiation, electrolysis, sonication, and plasma. Free radical polymerization is very important in polymer chemistry. It is one of the most developed method in chain-growth polymerization. Currently, most polymers in our daily life are synthesized by free radical polymerization, such as polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, polymethyl methacrylate, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate, styrene butadiene rubber, nitrile rubber, neoprene, etc. = Ionic polymerization = Based on IUPAC, ionic polymerization is a chain polymerization in which the kinetic-chain carriers are ions or ion pairs. It can be further divided into anionic polymerization and cationic polymerization. Ionic polymerization is widely used in our daily life. A lot of common polymers are generated by ionic polymerization such as butyl rubber, polyisobutylene, polyphenylene, polyoxymethylene, polysiloxane, polyethylene oxide, high density polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene, butadiene rubber, etc. Living anionic polymerization was developed since the 1950s, the chain will remain active indefinitely unless the reaction is transferred or terminated deliberately, which realizes the control of molar weight and PDI. = Coordination polymerization = Based on definition from IUPAC, coordination polymerization is a chain polymerization that involves the preliminary coordination of a monomer molecule with a chain carrier. The monomer is firstly coordinated with the transition metal active center, and then the activated monomer is inserted into the transition metal-carbon bond for chain growth. In some cases, coordination polymerization is also called insertion polymerization or complexing polymerization. Advanced coordination polymerizations can control the tacticity, molecular weight and PDI of the polymer effectively. In addition, the racemic mixture of the chiral metallocene can be separated into its enantiomers. The oligomerization reaction produces an optically active branched olefin using an optically active catalyst. = Living polymerization = Living polymerization was first introduced by Michael Szwarc in 1956. Based on definition from IUPAC, it is a chain polymerization from which chain transfer and chain termination are absent. As there is no chain-transfer and chain termination, the monomer in the system is consumed and the polymerization is stopped when the polymer chain remains active. Once the new monomer is added, the polymerization can proceed. Due to the low PDI and predictable molecular weight, living polymerization is at the forefront of polymer research. It could be further divided into living free radical polymerization, living ionic polymerization and living ring-opening metathesis polymerization, etc. = Ring-opening polymerization = According to definition from IUPAC ring-opening polymerization is a polymerization in which a cyclic monomer yields a monomeric unit which is acyclic or contains fewer cycles than the monomer. Generally, the ring-opening polymerization is carried out under mild conditions, and the by-product is less than the polycondensation reaction and the high molecular weight polymer is easily obtained. Common ring-opening polymerization products includes polypropylene oxide, polytetrahydrofuran, polyepichlorohydrin, polyoxymethylene, polycaprolactam and polysiloxane. = Reversible-deactivation polymerization = IUPAC stipulates that reversible- deactivation polymerization is a kind of chain polymerization, which is propagated by chain carriers that are deactivated reversibly, bringing them into active-dormant equilibria of which there might be more than one. An example of a reversible-deactivation polymerization is group-transfer polymerization.  Comparison to other polymerization methods  Previously, based on the difference between condensation reaction and addition reaction, Wallace Carothers classiÔ¨Åed polymerization as condensation polymerizations and addition polymerizations in 1929. However, Carothers‚Äô classification is not good enough in mechanism aspect, as in some case, addition polymerizations shows condensation features while condensation polymerization shows addition features. Then the classification was optimized as step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization. Based on IUPAC recommendation, the names of step-growth polymerization and chain-growth polymerization were further simplified as polyaddition and chain polymerization. = Step-growth polymerization = A step-growth reaction could happened between any two molecules with same or different degree of polymerization, usually monomers will form dimers, trimers, in matrix and finally react to long chain polymers. The mechanism of step-growth reaction is based on their functional group. Step-growth polymerization includes polycondensation and polyaddition. Polycondensation is a kind of polymerization whose chain growth is based on condensation reaction between two molecules with various degree of polymerization. The typical example are polyesters, polyamides and polyethers. It is sometimes confused by condensation previous definition of condensation polymerization. Polyaddition is a type of step-growth polymerization of which chain growth is based on addition reaction between two molecules of various degree of polymerization. The typical example for polyaddition is the synthesis of polyurethane. Compared to chain-growth polymerization, where the production of the growing chaingrowth is based on the reaction between polymer with active center and monomer, step-growth polymerization doesn‚Äôt have initiator or termination. The monomer in step-growth polymerization will be consumed very quickly to dimer, trimer or oligomer. The degree of polymerization will increase steady during the whole polymerization process. On the other hand, in chain-growth polymerization, the monomer consumed steadily but the degree of polymerization could be increased very quickly after chain initiation. Compared to step-growth polymerization, living chain- growth polymerization shows low PDI, predictable molecular mass and controllable conformation. Some researchers are working on the transformation of two polymerization methods. Generally, polycondensation proceeds in a step- growth polymerization mode. Substituent effect, catalyst transfer and biphasic system could be used for inhibiting the activity of monomer, and further prevent monomers from reacting with each other. It could make polycondensation process go in a chain-growth polymerization mode. = Polycondensation = The chain growth of polycondensation is based on condensation reaction. Low- molar-mass by-product will be formed during polymerization. It is a previous way to classify polymerization, which was introduced by Carothers in 1929. It is still used currently in some case. The step-growth polymerization with low- molar-mass by-product during chain growth is defined as polycondensation. The chain-growth polymerization a with low-malar-mass by-product during chain growth is recommended by IUPAC as ‚Äúcondensative chain polymerization‚Äù. = Addition polymerization = Addition polymerization is also a type of previous definition. The chain growth of addition polymerization is based addition reactions. There is no low-molar-mass by-product formed during polymerization. The step-growth polymerization based on addition reaction during chain growth is defined as polyaddition. Based on that definition, the addition polymerization contains both polyaddition and chain polymerization except condensative chain polymerization we used now.  Application  Chain polymerization products are widely used in many aspects of life, including electronic devices, food packaging, catalyst carriers, medical materials, etc. At present, the world's highest yielding polymers such as polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene (PP), etc. can be obtained by chain polymerization. In addition, some carbon nanotube polymer is used for electronical devices. Controlled living chain-growth conjugated polymerization will also enable the synthesis of well-defined advanced structures, including block copolymers. Their industrial applications extend to water purification, biomedical devices and sensors.

It is located in the historic centre of North America's oldest city, adjacent to the Roman Catholic Basilica of St. John The Baptist. The school was founded by the Franciscans in 1857, and from 1889 was administered by the Irish Christian Brothers. In 1999, St. Bon's became an independent Roman Catholic School in the Jesuit Tradition. In 2003, St. Bon's became a member of the Jesuit Secondary School Association. History Mullock Hall In 1855, there was a public auction to sell more than 30,000 building stones from Waterford, Ireland, which had been imported to build the local penitentiary. The Catholic Bishop of the day, Right Rev. John Thomas Mullock, took advantage of plans to build a smaller penal institution and purchased sufficient surplus stones to construct a Franciscan monastery. (The building was designated as a Registered Heritage Structure on May 15, 1989 by the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador and is listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places.) In April 1857 the bishop laid the cornerstone of the college named after the Franciscan Order's most scholarly and famous theologian, St. Bonaventure. A year later, in March 1858, the new facilities opened. Dormitories were installed upstairs as the institution operated as a seminary. Seven years later in 1865 the college began to admit secular students and, in 1889, the Irish Christian Brothers assumed administrative responsibilities for the school. The school was closed in 1998 due to the end of denominational education in the province. In 1999, the school was reopened with the Society of Jesus, from their local St. Pius X Church, offering administrative help; it is now the only K-12 private school, and the only Catholic school, in the city. Some of Newfoundland's greatest political and cultural leaders were educated at St. Bon's. Among its graduates are many Rhodes scholars, Jubilee scholars, two lieutenant governors, three chief justices, five archbishops and six regular Bishops. In addition, Newfoundland prime ministers Sir Edward Morris and Sir Michael Cashin were both St. Bon's alumni. Former premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Danny Williams, also attended St. Bon's, although he graduated from nearby Gonzaga High School. The school was also a perennial leader in sports and was the first educational institution to institute an annual sports day. The prestigious Boyle Trophy has a long association with the school. The school is now well known for its excellence in music. Under the direction of Vincenza Etchegary, the school now has more than seven bands, has won numerous awards, and has traveled to MusicFest Canada to compete in competitions, winning several awards there. In 2004, St. Bonaventure's College Wind Ensemble won the CBC Radio 2004 Provincial School Band Competition for Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, the Wind Ensemble traveled to Orlando, Florida to compete in the All American Band Festival, and took home many awards, including Most Outstanding Band. More recently, the Wind Ensemble won the 2017 CBC Music Class Challenge for their rendition of the 2018 Olympic Theme Song and had their version broadcast during national olympic television coverage on CBC. The school's choirs have also achieved success in many local competitions under the direction of Kellie Walsh; the Senior Choir won the 2006 Kiwanis Rose Bowl, and the Treble Choir won the same award in 2007. In April 2009, the Wind Ensemble, Senior Jazz Band and the Treble Choir of the school travelled to Anaheim, California, to participate in the Heritage Music Festival, winning the top awards. The choral program is now currently under the direction of Susan Quinn. A Strategic Plan was approved by the Board of Governors in 2015. This plan which outlines strategic initiatives to further the school's mission has met with considerable success. In May 2017, the school launched a news magazine, \\"Magis.\\" This magazine distributed to the school community and benefactors, outlines how the school is achieving its mission of forming, \\"Men and Women for and with Others.\\" At St. Bonaventure‚Äôs College, they teach their students to you use the schools motto ‚Äú Men and women for and with others‚Äù They teach them to live their everyday lives to this motto.

Sparsely populated until the late 1980s, Kabaty witnessed rapid growth in the 1990s and especially the 2000s. It is located near the Kabaty Woods, a popular weekend destination for Warsaw citizens.  History  Kabaty has been inhabited for at least 600 years. A village of that name was first mentioned in 1386 as belonging to Andrzej Cio≈Çek, standard-bearer of P≈Çock. Prince Janusz I of Masovia granted it Che≈Çm Law (a local variant of Magdeburg Law) and a certain degree of internal autonomy. Until the 16th century the village remained part of the Cio≈Çek family domain. In the 1580 census it was reported as covering some 70 hectares. In the early 17th century the village was transferred to the Piekarski family. In 1656 it was completely destroyed by Swedish armies during The Deluge. In 1721 the village of Kabaty, located on the Wis≈Ça River, was purchased by El≈ºbieta Sieniawska, widow of Hetman Adam Miko≈Çaj Sieniawski and owner of Wilan√≥w Palace. The village was rebuilt after a plague. El≈ºbieta Sieniawska, who also bought the surrounding Kabaty Woods, ordered protection for its animals and trees. Even the wood needed to build her new manor in 1726 was transported from Nieporƒôt rather than from the surrounding forest. In 1775 the village had 16 houses and a szlachta manor. By 1827 it had grown to 17 houses and 177 inhabitants, mostly serfs. In 1864, after the January 1863 Uprising, the village was administratively attached to Wilan√≥w. By 1905 it had 38 houses and 319 inhabitants. After Poland regained independence in 1918, the village became a popular summer vacation place for nearby Warsaw. The forest was parcelled, and a small resort was built there with 8 houses and 61 permanent inhabitants (in addition to 59 houses and 397 inhabitants in the village itself). In 1937 the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau moved to a specially constructed facility in the Kabaty Woods.W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, Enigma: How the German Machine Cipher was Broken, and How it was Read by the Allies in World War Two, edited and translated by Christopher Kasparek, Frederick, Maryland, University Publications of America, 1984, p. 43. The following year, Warsaw's president (mayor) Stefan Starzy≈Ñski purchased the Kabaty Woods for the city and turned them into a park and forest reserve. The Woods are now named after Starzy≈Ñski. During World War II, they were a scene of partisan warfare against Poland's German occupiers. The heaviest fighting around Kabaty took place during the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, when Home Army units from southern Poland sought to break through to Warsaw via the Woods. After the war, the village and the fields adjacent to the Woods were nationalized and treated as a space for Warsaw's further expansion. It was not until 1951, however, that it became part of Warsaw, included in the newly created district of Ursyn√≥w. In the 1990s the area was built up with apartment blocks and single-family houses, and agricultural activity was discontinued. The area is now one of the fastest-growing parts of Warsaw. Due to its proximity to the Woods ‚Äî a popular weekend destination for Varsovians ‚Äî it is considered especially desirable among the middle class. Kabaty has two Warsaw Metro facilities: the Kabaty train yard, and the Kabaty station itself, the southern terminus of line no. 1, beneath the intersection of WƒÖwozowa Street and KEN Avenue.

He is most known for, in WCW, portraying the character \\"Oklahoma\\", a mockery of WWF's commentator Jim Ross, and was the heaviest WCW Cruiserweight Champion, although he was forced to vacate the title for exceeding the 220 lb weight limit. Ed Ferrara began his work in television production and writing, contributing to shows such as Honey, I Shrunk the Kids: The TV Show and Weird Science on the USA Network. Ferrara was also a wrestler in Slammers Wrestling Federation known as Bruce Beaudine. He was most recently working on the creative team for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. Biography =Education= Ferrara graduated from Drew University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts in theater arts and English. Between 1994 and 1996, Ferrara was trained and wrestled in the California-based independent promotion - Slammers Wrestling Federation. Ferrara worked under the ring name of Bruce Beaudine and on April 11, 1996 he won the SWF heavyweight championship.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=14049 =World Wrestling Federation (1998‚Äì1999)= In 1998, Ferrara was writing for television shows on the USA Network. Executives at USA learned that he was working as an independent wrestler on the weekends, and set up a meeting with him and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He matched the credentials required for the job including previous experience in wrestling and working in television production. He secured an interview with Vince McMahon and began working with the WWF at the King of the Ring in 1998. He immediately clicked with his writing partner Vince Russo. Eventually, Ferrara and Russo were offered a better deal to work for WCW, and left the WWF to go work there. =World Championship Wrestling (1999‚Äì2001)= Ferrara and Russo began working for WCW in October 1999, and they placed themselves within the onscreen product of WCW. They migrated their style of writing from the WWF. Matches were shorter in length, speaking segments both inside and outside the ring were more prominent, and a far greater emphasis was made in pushing midcard wrestlers to the point that everyone on the card had a gimmick and/or storyline. Successful products of their initial tenure at WCW included Screamin' Norman Smiley, 3 Count, the re-invention of The Outsiders, The Mamalukes, 'Psycho' David Flair, The Revolution, The Filthy Animals, and Chris Benoit's Main Event push, among others. There were some storylines which did not necessarily go over with fans the way they wished including Buzzkill, The Maestro, Buff Bagwell, and Madusa winning the Cruiserweight title. Another storyline that didn't go over well with fans was Ferrara's controversial parody of WWF commentator Jim Ross, in which he took the onscreen name of Oklahoma and began parodying Ross on WCW programming, even going as far as to mimick Ross' Bell's Palsy affliction. He had previously done an impersonation of Ross in the WWF during an angle with Tiger Ali Singh where he was called from the audience as a fan and did his Ross impression. Ross would state that his impersonation was \\"personal\\" and \\"very hurtful\\".https://411mania.com/wrestling/jim-ross-oklahoma-wcw-ed- ferrara-vince-russo-dr-death-steve-williams/ Jim Cornette would later spit in his face and challenge him to a fight for making fun of his long-time friend, Jim Ross. He defeated Madusa for the Cruiserweight Title. Their initial stint was epitomized by the reintroduction of the nWo after months of storylines which ultimately saw Bret Hart win the world title at the expense of his nemesis Goldberg. However, both Bret Hart and Goldberg got injured a few days prior to a major WCW pay-per-view. WCW later formed a booking committee which consisted of former bookers including Kevin Sullivan, Kevin Nash, J. J. Dillon and Bob Mould. This would also mark the beginning of the end for the friendship between Russo and Ferrara who both took opposing positions. Russo refused to work in the booking committee as he felt he was jobbed out by the backstage politics of the company whilst Ferrara decided he would stay on as he had just relocated his entire family to Atlanta and so felt compelled to continue his work as a writer. This would be the last time Russo and Ferrara would willingly work with one another in a wrestling environment, until being reunited in TNA years later (see below). The success of the booking committee was limited at best. Ratings had plummeted and WCW was in a state of disrepair. The new committee also led to the mass exodus of the most promising mid-card wrestlers in the company. Now known as The Radicalz, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddie Guerrero and Perry Saturn all walked out of WCW as Kevin Sullivan stated he had no plans to use them on subsequent programming. It was rumored that 17 wrestlers had asked for their release that night but only 5 of them got their successful release (this included Shane Douglas but he would return in April of that year). Within 2 months the booking committee was disbanded and in a desperate attempt to salvage their ailing product WCW hired back the 2 men who they thought could help their product, Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff. This led to Ed Ferrara getting demoted to a road agent position He did voiceovers that played over the intercom when non-English speaking La Parka was doing interviews, often getting La Parka in trouble with his opponents with the comments he created over the intercom. =Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2002, 2009‚Äì2010)= From June to August 2002, Ferrara did color commentary on the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling weekly pay-per-views alongside Mike Tenay and Don West when the company started. At the time when the company was cutting costs due to lack of financial backing, Ferrara chose to leave after being told that he would not be receiving a paycheck on a regular basis and that he would only be paid when the company was able to make that money back. Ferrara returned to the TNA creative team as of the September 20, 2009, TNA pay-per-view event No Surrender, being paired with Vince Russo once again. On June 30, 2010, it was reported that Ferrara was no longer working for TNA. =Later years= After WCW folded, Ed Ferrara debuted in NWA Wildside and criticized the concept of women participating in wrestling. This began a feud with homosexual wrestler Lazz. A Five Minute Survival Match was booked for the Wildside Anniversary Show that year between the two. If Ferrera survived five minutes with Lazz, he got five minutes with the Wildside creative mind, NWA VP Bill Behrens. Lazz accidentally knocked out referee Jimmy Rivers, allowing Behrens to come out and hit Ferrara with a tennis racket. Lazz then hit his finisher, the Britney Spear, and Behrens entered the ring and physically slammed the unconscious hand of Rivers. In July 2004, he wrote a book titled Dark Consequences consisting of five horror short stories. In late 2005, a 3-disc DVD boxset was released entitled Pro Wrestling's Ultimate Insiders which consists of interviews with him along with co-writer Vince Russo about their time in the World Wrestling Federation and World Championship Wrestling. Ferrara spent most of the subsequent years teaching at Columbia College in Chicago, Illinois. In 2005, his former writing partner Kevin Murphy named a character after him on the TV series Desperate Housewives. In July 2013, Ferrara obtained his Masters of Fine Arts degree in creative writing from the University of Southern Maine's Stonecoast program. Ferrara currently resides in Florida where he teaches \\"Creative Writing for Entertainment\\" at Full Sail University. In 2014, Ferrara was a regular host on Major League Wrestling Radio.

Michael was a son of the Georgian king David VI Narin and his wife, Tamar Amanelisdze, or a Palaeologian princess. In the latter case, Michael might have been named after his Byzantine ancestor, the emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Michael opposed accession of his elder brother, Constantine I, on the death of their father in 1293. In a subsequent internecine war, Michael seized control of the provinces of Racha, Lechkhumi, and Argveti. The conflict continued until 1327, when Michael succeeded on the death of the childless Constantine as king of Imereti, although he had claimed the title earlier, as in the 1326 charter sanctioning a reparational payment (sasiskhlo, a Georgian equivalent of weregild) by a certain Gogitashvili to Mikeladze. Michael sought to resubjugate to the crown the great nobles and provincial dynasts (eristavi), who had asserted greater autonomy for themselves in the reign of Constantine I. His efforts were of limited success; all he could achieve was the pledge from the eristavi to pay tribute and provide troops for a royal army. Michael died in 1329.

It was the last to feature Mary Tamm as Romana. The serial is set on the planets Atrios and Zeos, and another planet in between them. In the serial, the war between Atrios and Zeos is nearing its end. Mentalis, a commandant computer on Zeos, and the Marshal of Atrios (John Woodvine), plot to wipe each other out. At the same time, the Shadow (William Squire), a henchman of the Black Guardian (Valentine Dyall), steals the time and space vessel the TARDIS, which contains the first five segments of the powerful Key to Time, and kidnaps Princess Astra of Atrios (Lalla Ward), who is the sixth and final segment.  Plot  In their search for the final segment of the Key to Time, the Fourth Doctor and Romana arrive on the planet Atrios, which has endured a recent bombing by their neighbouring planet Zeos, with whom they are at war. The Marshal of Atrios is about to launch a counterstrike on Zeos, but the Doctor finds that Zeos is deserted save for the giant computer Mentalis, which is controlling the war. He also discovers that the true opponent is a third planet called the Planet of Evil, ruled by \\"the Shadow\\". The Shadow, an agent of the Black Guardian, has Princess Astra of Atrios captive, threatening to torture her if she doesn't give him the location of the final segment of the Key to Time (which she doesn't know). After disabling Mentalis, with the assistance of Romana and K9, the Doctor creates a substitute sixth segment out of chronodyne, which gives the Key enough power to create a time loop in which to trap the Marshal's ship (armed with missiles for the final strike) as well as the Mentalis control room. On the Planet of Evil, the Doctor encounters another Time Lord, Drax, who he last met at the Academy. Drax has been employed under duress by the Shadow but agrees to help the Doctor. During this encounter, Drax names the Doctor as Theta Sigma. The Shadow wants the Key for himself, and forces the Doctor to retrieve it for him. The Doctor leads a servant of the Shadow, known as a Mute, to his TARDIS and opens the door, but is suddenly shrunk to tiny size by Drax, who then shrinks himself using the dimensional stabiliser from his own (in-need-of-repair) TARDIS. Drax had misinterpreted the Doctor's plan and shrank the Doctor instead of the Mute. The Mute returns to the Shadow with the Key, and the Doctor realises why the Shadow has requested it: Astra is the final segment, and is transformed in front of everyone. Using their diminished size, the Doctor and Drax smuggle themselves into the Shadow's lair inside of the now-restored K9. Drax again uses the stabiliser, this time to return them to their normal size. The Doctor snatches the partially assembled Key and the final segment, and disappears with Romana and K9 in the TARDIS, assembling the Key after dealing with the Mentalis and the Marshal's missiles. The White Guardian appears to congratulate the Doctor on finding and assembling the Key to Time, and requests that it be sent to him. However, the Doctor, realising that it is actually the Black Guardian in disguise‚Äîdue to his lack of compassion for the fate of Princess Astra‚Äîorders the Key to re-disperse. Enraged, the Black Guardian threatens to kill him. In an attempt to evade him, the Doctor fits a randomiser into the TARDIS guidance system, sending it to an unknown location in time and space, and leaving the Doctor with no idea of where they are headed, and the Guardian being unable to follow. Production Working titles for this story included Armageddon. This story was the last that Bob Baker wrote with Dave Martin. Baker's next story, Nightmare of Eden, would be a solo effort. In the original draft of the script, the Black Guardian did not appear at all. He was only inserted in the later drafts by incoming script editor Douglas Adams and Producer Graham Williams. Broadcast and reception Twenty-three minutes into transmission of Part Five, a technical breakdown resulted in the episode going off the air for fifty seconds. The break occurred at the point where the Doctor is being escorted to the TARDIS by the Mute; and the Shadow makes to remove his control device from Princess Astra, saying \\"Now, my Princess, your work is done. Your destiny is at-\\". Music was played (\\"Gotcha\\" by Tom Scott, better known as the theme music to NBC's Starsky & Hutch) and a TEMPORARY FAULT caption slide displayed until the fault was rectified. When transmission restarted, the videotape had been slightly rewound so there was a repeat of the action immediately prior to the break‚Äîwith the Shadow's line also finally completed as \\"Your destiny is at hand.\\" A reconstruction of the break can be found as a bonus item on the serial's remastered DVD release. Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping gave the serial an unfavourable review in The Discontinuity Guide (1995), describing it as \\"a dreary end-of-season Oh-my-God-the-money's-run-out 'spectacular'\\" without subtle acting. In The Television Companion (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that The Armageddon Factor was \\"entertaining enough in itself, with some good direction by Michael Hayes and generally fine production values, but ultimately fails to tie up all the loose ends and leaves the over-arching plot strangely unresolved\\". They praised the Shadow but felt that the other characters were one-dimensional, and called the ending a \\"cop-out\\". In 2011, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times stated that the serial \\"hugely disappoints, yet it's not an unmitigated disaster\\". He criticised the characterisation and much of the plot, but praised the direction and the Shadow. On the other hand, DVD Talk's Justin Felix gave the serial four out of five stars, saying that it \\"packs more of a wallop than the previous two stories\\" and had everything typical of Doctor Who. Felix also called it Mary Tamm's best performance. Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in June 1980.

It is to the southeast of Stroud about upstream. It gives its name to Chalford parish, which covers the villages of Chalford, Chalford Hill, France Lynch, Bussage and Brownshill, spread over of the Cotswold countryside. At this point the valley is also called the Golden Valley. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward covers a similar area to the parish but extends to the Brimscombe and Thrupp ward. The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,509.  History  The remains, and known sites, of many barrows indicate that the plateau area of Chalford Hill, France Lynch and Bussage has been an area of continuous settlement for probably at least 4,000 years. The Vernacular Architecture and Buildings of Stroud and Chalford : Nigel McCullagh Paterson Pub. Trafford Publishing, 2006 , Stone Age flints have been found in the area as well as the remains of a Roman Villa. Several of the place names in the area are also Anglo-Saxon in origin. The name Chalford may be derived from Calf (Way) Ford, or possibly from the Old English cealj or Chalk and Ford (river crossing point). There were two ancient crossings at Chalford apart from the ford from which the village was named: Stoneford, recorded from the later 12th century, was the crossing-point of a track up Cowcombe hill on the line of the later Cirencester turnpike and by 1413 another track crossed into Minchinhampton by Stephen's bridge at Valley Corner.A History of the County of Gloucester: Volume 11: Bisley and Longtree Hundreds (1976) Chalford Hill is a recent title for the western end of the hill: Its original name was Chalford Lynch. \\"Lynch\\" (lynchet in modern English)Both forms derive from the Anglo- Saxon hlinc. means a cultivated terrace following the contours of a hill. Chalford Lynch and its extension France Lynch originated in the late 16th century as collections of stone cottages many built illegally on the peripheries of Bisley common as the mill expansion in the valley outstripped accommodation space in the valley.Ralph Bigland 1791: Historical Monumental and Genealogical Connections Relative to the County of Gloucester Many dwellings in Franch Lynch and Chalford Hill only became legitimate at the time of the parliamentary enclosures in 1869.Gloucestershire records office; Parliamentary Bisley Inclosures: 1869, Q/RI 22 The settling of displaced Flemish Huguenot weavers in the 17th and 18th centuries brought quality silk and woollen cloth manufacturing to the valley. Some say that they gave their name to the neighbouring village of France Lynch. It is more likely that the name comes from a non-conformist chapel, France Meeting that was displaced from the village in the valley to the Lynches above.France Congregational Church, Chalford: Story of 257 years, 1662-1919 Paperback ‚Äì 1919:by Herbert W Gurd. France Congregational Church. At this point the Golden Valley is narrow and deep so many weavers' cottages were built clinging to the sides of the hills, giving the village an Alpine air. It is sometimes still referred to as the 'Alpine village'. Cotswolds Canal Trust As the paths on the hillsides were too narrow for more conventional forms of transport donkeys were used to carry groceries and other goods to houses, this tradition continuing until as recently as the 1950s. Chalford expanded rapidly with the opening of the Thames and Severn Canal in 1789 and the village became one of the centres for the manufacture of broadcloth. Its wealthy clothiers lived close to their mills and built many fine houses which survive to this day.  Architecture  Dry stone wall in Chalford Hill In common with other towns and villages in the area, buildings are generally constructed of Cotswold stone, with local fields enclosed by dry stone walling. The area is designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the village itself is a designated conservation area. Chalford is noted for two fine Arts and Crafts movement churches. Christ Church (Church of England) contains work by Norman Jewson, William Simmonds, Peter Waals, Edward Barnsley, Norman Bucknell, amongst other distinguished artists and craftsmen working in the Cotswold tradition. The Church of Our Lady of the Angels (Roman Catholic), Brownshill, by W. D. Caroe (1930), contains outstanding stained glass by Douglas Strachan. France Lynch, part of the civil parish but a separate ecclesiastical parish has a splendid listed church, St John the Baptist, built by George Frederick Bodley who went on to build Washington National Cathedral in Washington DC. Christ Church, Chalford Round house at Chalford One of the most distinctive, and most photographed, features of the village is the Round House. It was built by the Thames and Severn Canal Company as a lengthman's cottage and is one of five along the Thames and Severn Canal.Chalford Guide. Pub. Chalford Parish Council 1990 (The others are at Coates, Cerney Wick, Marston Meysey and Inglesham.) A notable feature is that access is by way of steps up to the first floor as the ground floor would have originally been stabling for a horse. Apart from a relatively short break in the 1950s when it was a museum it has fulfilled its function as a private residence, which it continues to do to this day. Directly opposite the Round House is Chalford Place, a Grade II* listed building built on the site of the original home of the de Chalkfordes who are mentioned in documents as early as 1240. The house, formerly known as the Companys Arms, is one of the earlier houses in the valley. Built as a mill owner's house it became an inn in the 19th century. It owed its name Companys Arms to the East India Company for which the mills of Chalford supplied much of its cloth. It remained an inn until the 1960s when it reverted to its former name of Chalford Place. The Vernacular Architecture and Buildings of Stroud and Chalford : Nigel McCullagh Paterson Pub.

The store, which has been running with the aid of a volunteer workforce since 2003, is now affiliated with the independent organisation Co-operatives UK, making the share issue possible. Residents snap up hundreds of pounds of shares in village shop On 4 March 2012 the store and the donkey were featured in an episode of Countryfile. The store prospered within the local church hall but returned to the High Street in May 2014 and now thrives in the former Seventh Day Adventist Hall. This was made possible by a second community share issue which raised in excess of ¬£50,000 alongside a bank loan and various grants.  Residents  Notable residents include James Bradley, the third Astronomer Royal, who died in Chalford in 1762, and the 19th-century sculptor John Thomas. Henry Cooper lived in the village as a child, after being evacuated here during the Second World War.Boxing legend Cooper's Stroud links The artist Damien Hirst has a studio in the village. Lord Janvrin, former Private Secretary to H.M. the Queen, maintains a house in the village and on his retirement was gazetted as Baron Janvrin of Chalford Hill, on 10 October 2007. The Public Relations guru Mark Borkowski lives at Oakridge. Brownshill The sub-village of Brownshill is home to the Monastery of Our Lady and St Bernard which is home to a community of eight Bernardine Cistercian nuns. There is a sister community at the Monastery of Our Lady of Hyning at Warton, near Carnforth. St Mary of the Angels is a small Roman Catholic church built at Brownshill in the 1930s with funds from two former nurses, Bertha Kessler and Katherine Hudson. The architect was W. D. Caroe, with windows by Douglas Strachan.  The Golden Valley  The question of how the Golden Valley acquired its name is sometimes asked. The first written reference to the Golden Valley is in Rudder's 1779 History of Gloucestershire. (It can be assumed that the name pre-dates his recording of it but how far back in unknown other than a reference in Issac Taylor's map dated 1777 \\\\- see Point 4 below.) The Place Names of Gloucestershire, published in 1965 by the University of Cambridge and edited by A H Smith, notes that Rudder's is the first written record and also notes 'doubtless so called from the wealth that came from its industries.' However, there is no substantiation or source for this particular observation. It is also worth noting that Rudder records that a Roger Gulden held lands in the area in the middle Medieval period, therefore it is possible that in fact this is the source of the name as a corruption of the surname. From time to time, people will claim that it was Queen Victoria who named the Valley sometime during her reign. This is a myth and she is not responsible for giving this delightful valley the name, which clearly has a significantly longer history. On the other hand she did pass through the Golden Valley twice in the summer and on both occasions made a note in her journals.http://www.queenvictoriasjournals.org On 29 September 1849, Queen Victoria travelled from Gloucester to Swindon by train, :\\"Before we came to Gloucester we passed through the beautiful valley of Stroud, so green & hilly, but soon after Swindon, all beauty of scenery faded away.\\" (So green and not golden.) Three years later, on 30 August 1852, she wrote: :\\"We passed Reading & at 2 reached Swindon, where we got out & had some luncheon. Left again in less than ¬Ω an hour, & passed by the very pretty & picturesque valley of Stroud, which is full of manufactures scattered about, & this makes one hardly realise, that it is a manufacturing district. After 3 we reached Gloucester, & here we left the Great Western for another line. The Malvern Hills could be distinctly seen in the distance. We stopped at ¬Ω p. 4 at Broomsgrove station, where the Worcestershire Yeomanry, with Mr Clive, their Col: were drawn up, Sir J. Packington & Ld Lyttelton, being also there with their wives, &c.;\\" Later in the 19 century the use of the Golden Valley had become common: 1\\\\. A Handbook for Travellers in Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Herefordshire published 1867 records when describing the rail journey to Stroud 'the traveller is carried along the side of a steep valley, thickly timbered, whose tints in autumn have given it the name the Golden Valley.' 2\\\\. THE JOURNAL OF HORTICILTURE, COTTAGE GARDENER, COUNTRY GENTLEMAN. BEE-KEEPER ...By GEORGE W.JOHNSON,F.R.H.S. published in Country Life in 1870 refers to the 'golden valley in Stroud and beautiful it is.' 3\\\\. Paul Hawkins Fisher in his Notes and Recollections of Stroud, published in 1871 describes the Golden Valley and notes that 'in autumn it is all a-glow with the bright golden tints of its beech leaves.' Finally... 4\\\\. The Victoria County History for Gloucestershire Vol 11 published in 1976 '..Golden Valley in the south-east part, which had acquired its name by the late 18th century, either from its autumn hues or from the prosperity of the local cloth-mills,' and refers to Issac Taylor's 1777 map of Gloucestershire as a footnote. Any mention of Queen Victoria naming the valley 'golden' is recent, without verification, and seems confined to a few blogs, an article in the Stroud News and Journal, a couple of guide books, and mentions on the radio station BBC Gloucestershire.
