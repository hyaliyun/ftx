With the Nile river in the east of the country, parts of Sudan have substantial water resources, but those in the west have to rely on wadis, seasonal wells which often dry up. These imbalances in water availability are a source of hardship, as well as a source of conflict. While storage facilities are limited, many local communities have constructed makeshift dams and reservoirs, weirs, which help in stabilizing farming communities. Farmers also utilize hafirs to store rain water which falls in the rainy season, but groundwater remains a vital source of water for over 80% of Sudanese people. For decades, political instability has led to terrible conditions and thwarted many projects and relief efforts, but aid is making its way through. Several water infrastructure projects have been enacted in recent years, with both domestic and international sources of funding. Funding from the UN has provided 9,550 local farmers with better access to water and fertile soils. A project which also plans to replant forest cover in the wadi to reverse desertification. Darfur is located in an arid region, in the western part of Sudan, where water scarcity is common. Due to recent population growth, there is an increased pressure on urban water supply sources and infrastructure. Now there is a greater difficulty accessing water‚Äîespecially for cattle farmers. Many women and children, mostly girls, spend countless hours walking to a clean water supply a year preventing time taking care of children and schooling. Collecting water from ponds, marshes, ditches, or hand-dug wells, often contaminated with disease-causing parasites and bacteria. Experience dry and wet seasons. Wet seasons are plentiful with rainfall and crops; however, dry seasons force families to make mile treks for water and some relocated during the dry seasons.  Water resources  The Nile river flows through the eastern part of the country and provides a large portion of those living nearby with ample water for drinking and agriculture. Wetlands flanking the Nile cover almost 10% of the country, and support diverse riparian ecosystems. Others living in the more arid western region rely on wells or seasonal wadi to obtain their daily water. These wadi are dry stream beds for large portions of the year, but people are able to access the groundwater that accumulates underneath by digging well holes. Water storage infrastructure is limited throughout the western part of the country, but many local communities have constructed makeshift dams and reservoirs called weirs which can store water for future use and play big parts in stabilizing farming communities. Farmers also utilize hafirs to store rain water during rainy season, but groundwater remains a vital source of water for over 80% of Sudanese people. The Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System, the largest aquifer in the country, provides most of Sudan's drinking water,  Quality  Another concern within Sudan is the quality of the water people have access to. In eastern Sudan, a study was conducted in the cities of Wad Madani and Al Khartoum that revealed 86% of water in public taps was meeting both Sudanese and international quality levels. In Darfur, water scarcity is more prevalent with many people regularly being exposed to drought and famine conditions. Most of the western part of Sudan lacks year round access to quality water, as the wadi are dry for much of the year unless heavy rains fall. Due to instability in much of this part of the county, water quality dramatically decreases when compared to the more water-secure east. The capital of Sudan, Khartoum, will benefit greatly from the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam and looks to be in a much better position with regards to accessing quality sanitary water in the near future. Many of the communities living nearby the border of Chad are exposed to chronic water shortages with no solution in sight until the conflicts are fully resolved.  Water Treatment  United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), rehabilitated an unused water treatment plant in El Fasher, Darfur‚Äôs state capital, installing a chlorination unit ensuring water quality. This unit now produces enough water for 37,500 people a day. Fecal contamination of drinking water supplies is the main cause of diseases found in water. Proper disposal, waste removal, of fecal matter are rare and often difficult without a proper plumbing infrastructure. Consequently, child stunting rate increases with high levels of open defecation and limited access to improved water sources. Poor sanitation conditions cause about 700,000 children deaths a year and prevent full mental and physical development.  Plans for improvement  An organization called United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) had done chlorination plant projects in Darfur's capital city of El Fasher with major funding from Japan. The organization rehabilitated a water treatment plant in 2010, then installed a chlorination plant to improve the quality for over 37,500 people. In the city of El Daein, UNOPS had done projects rehabilitating water treatment facilities, helping over 50,000 with access to clean water. Japan has played a huge part by providing funding and expertise in projects to develop rural Sudan and its access to clean water. UNOPS had completed projects that now help over 250,000 people with access to a potable water source. The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is already under construction on the Nile river just nine miles upstream of the border of Sudan and has the potential for a multitude of positive effects for the country. More reliable river levels would allow large-scale irrigation and agricultural production that was not possible due to the annual change of the Nile within Sudan being over 8 m Hydro-electric power produced from the dam would exceed the amount needed by Ethiopia, so Sudan will stand to benefit greatly by being able to purchase this extra power. Another benefit from this dam will be creation of jobs, as the infrastructure to distribute the electricity efficiently does not exist yet and will have to be built. Grassroots organizations have seen success in the Darfur region, an example being the Wadi El Ku Catchment Forum, which was founded to help the 81,000 residents in the Wadi El Ku area provide more water for their crops. The local group consists of 50 representatives from 34 villages in the area, and these men and women decided the construction of weirs would be both cost-efficient and help the most people. Their efforts to build three weirs with funding from the UN provided 9,550 local farmers with better access to water and fertile soils. This project also plans to replant forest cover in the wadi to accommodate pastoral farmers and reverse climate change from previous desertification.

It is the shortest international boundary of both states. Map showing Turkmenistan with Kazakhstan to the north-west Description The land border starts at the eastern shore of the Caspian Sea at Cape Sue, just to the north of the Turkmen town of Garabogaz, and traces an arc paralleling the Garabogazk√∂l (Kara-Bogaz-Gol) lake, before finally following a short section along some hills in the Ustyurt plateau to the Uzbek tripoint. History Russia had conquered Central Asia in the 19th century by annexing the formerly independent Khanates of Kokand and Khiva and the Emirate of Bukhara. After the Communists took power in 1917 and created the Soviet Union it was decided to divide Central Asia into ethnically-based republics in a process known as National Territorial Delimitation (or NTD). This was in line with Communist theory that nationalism was a necessary step on the path towards an eventually communist society, and Joseph Stalin‚Äôs definition of a nation as being ‚Äúa historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture‚Äù. The NTD is commonly portrayed as being nothing more than a cynical exercise in divide and rule, a deliberately Machiavellian attempt by Stalin to maintain Soviet hegemony over the region by artificially dividing its inhabitants into separate nations and with borders deliberately drawn so as to leave minorities within each state.The charge is so common as to have become almost the conventional wisdom within mainstream journalistic coverage of Central Asia, with Stalin himself often the one drawing the borders, see for example Stourton, E. in The Guardian, 2010 Kyrgyzstan: Stalin's deadly legacy https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/jun/20/kyrgyzstan-stalins- deadly-legacy; Zeihan, P. for Stratfor, 2010 The Kyrgyzstan Crisis and the Russian Dilemma https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/kyrgyzstan-crisis-and- russian-dilemma; The Economist, 2010 Kyrgyzstan - Stalin's Harvest https://www.economist.com/briefing/2010/06/17/stalins- harvest?story_id=16377083; Pillalamarri, A in the Diplomat, 2016, The Tajik Tragedy of Uzbekistan https://thediplomat.com/2016/09/the-tajik-tragedy-of- uzbekistan/; Rashid, A in the New York Review of Books, 2010, Tajikistan - the Next Jihadi Stronghold? https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2010/11/29/tajikistan- next-jihadi-stronghold; Schreck, C. in The National, 2010, Stalin at core of Kyrgyzstan carnage, https://www.thenational.ae/world/asia/stalin-at-core-of- kyrgyzstan-carnage-1.548241 Though indeed the Soviets were concerned at the possible threat of pan-Turkic nationalismBergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 39-40, as expressed for example with the Basmachi movement of the 1920s, closer analysis informed by the primary sources paints a much more nuanced picture than is commonly presented.Haugen, Arne (2003) The Establishment of National Republics in Central Asia, Palgrave Macmillan, pgs. 24-5, 182-3Khalid, Adeeb (2015) Making Uzbekistan: Nation, Empire, and Revolution in the Early USSR, Cornell University Press, pg. 13Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 46 The Soviets aimed to create ethnically homogeneous republics, however many areas were ethnically-mixed (e.g. the Ferghana Valley) and it often proved difficult to assign a ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô ethnic label to some peoples (e.g. the mixed Tajik-Uzbek Sart, or the various Turkmen/Uzbek tribes along the Amu Darya).Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 47 Local national elites strongly argued (and in many cases overstated) their case and the Soviets were often forced to adjudicate between them, further hindered by a lack of expert knowledge and the paucity of accurate or up-to-date ethnographic data on the region.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 44-5Edgar, Adrienne Lynn (2004) Tribal Nation: The Making Of Soviet Turkmenistan, Princeton University Press, pg. 53 Furthermore NTD also aimed to create ‚Äòviable‚Äô entities, with economic, geographical, agricultural and infrastructural matters also to be taken into account and frequently trumping those of ethnicity.Bergne, Paul (2007) The Birth of Tajikistan: National Identity and the Origins of the Republic, IB Taurus & Co Ltd, pg. 43-4Starr, S.

The Turkmen SSR was officially created in 1924. The Kazakh ASSR as depicted on a Russian map from 1938, showing the border cutting south of the lake The border between Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan originally ran either in a straight line west from the Uzbek tripoint, cutting through the Garabogazk√∂l (Kara-Bogaz-Gol) lake and then running through the lake's narrow inlet to the Caspian Sea, or parallel to the southern shore thereby giving Kazakhstan the entire lake (sources differ - see maps). In 1932 Soviet authorities decided to move the border northwards so as to include the entire lake within the Turkmen SSR, aiming to boost the industrial development of Turkmenistan by enabling them to exploit the lake's rich salt deposits. The border also originally extended further east during the period 1924-30 when a then much larger Karakalpakstan was part of the Kazakh ASSR (See Kazakhstan‚ÄìUzbekistan border). The boundary became an international frontier in 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the independence of its constituent republics. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan held discussions on the border in 2000-2001 with an initial delimitation treaty being signed on 5 July 2001. The border was fully demarcated on the ground during the period 2003-2005.

The site includes a gristmill building, the miller's house, and a covered bridge. With Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, Ruff ºs Mill (1840s) and the Miller ºs House (c. 1850), along with Concord Covered Bridge, exemplify the small, rural water-powered mill complexes that were common in Georgia and the South in the mid-to-late-19th century. Located on former Cherokee land, the land lots comprising this complex were won in the Georgia Gold and Land Lottery of 1832. Martin L. Ruff, prominent pioneer settler of Cobb County, and his descendants operated the wheat-and-corn grist mill through most of the century. During the Civil War on July 4, 1864, the fierce Battle at Ruff ºs Mill, where the Federals routed the Confederates, made history as the only line of Rebel earthworks successfully charged and overrun during the Atlanta Campaign. Although the grist mill ºs fieldstone facade was pockmarked with bullets, still visible today, the dwelling was spared from torching when it was designated to serve as a field hospital for the many wounded combatants. The Miller ºs House was constructed in a simple architectural style featuring a distinctive tall, narrow profile that is identified by preservationists as Plantation Plain. The home has been adapted over the years to the needs and changing tastes of its occupants, but the exterior today remains largely faithful to its original appearance. The terraced grounds were designed in the 1930s by the celebrated William C. Pauley, creator of Hurt Park ‚ÄîAtlanta ºs first professionally trained landscape architect. One-lane Concord Covered Bridge, spanning Nickajack Creek, has undergone numerous iterations since its initial construction in 1872. During a century and a half in continuous use, this landmark bridge has been rebuilt, repaired and strengthened to accommodate modern automobile traffic. The Concord Covered Bridge spanning Nickajack Creek Listed on the National Register of Historic Places, this covered bridge on Concord Road is the only one remaining in Cobb County and one of only 16 left in Georgia. The bridge measures 133 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 13 feet high, with a low seven-foot entry clearance that has in recent years resulted in collisions by incautious drivers of oversized vehicles. Two successive bridges were erected at the same location on land owned by Martin L. Ruff, Sr., a prominent early settler in this district of Cobb County, whose family members operated the adjacent grist mill. Ruff ºs neighbors, Robert Daniell of the Concord Woolen Mill and State Senator John Gann, joined with him in 1848 to build a flat-decked bridge span over stone-masonry supports, that appear to have been retained during construction of the covered bridge 24 years later. Swimmers in Nickajack Creek, 1916 Although significantly enhanced structurally over the decades, Concord Covered Bridge looks today much as it did in the 19th century ‚Äîwith a heavy wood-planked floor, sides of vertical board and batten, and a cedar shake roof. Also look upstream of the bridge, where you will see the remnants of Nickajack Dam. This dam provided water power via a sluice that ran under Concord Road to the Grist Mill. With a drop of over 20 feet from the top of the dam to the mill due to the hairpin gorge of Nickajack Creek, the Grist Mill had a strong power source with a very short distance for the water to travel.

The conidia of the fungus are distinguishable from those of related species due to their lack of curvature. C. pallescens has been reported to cause infection in plants, and in immunocompetent individuals. This species is the anamorph of Cochliobolus pallescens. Morphology The colonies of C. pallescens differ in morphology depending on the growth medium used. On Czapek Yeast Extract Agar (CYA), colonies of C. pallescens are 50-65mm in diameter. On Malt Extract Agar (MEA), the colonies are fuzzy in texture, and pale grey to grey in colour. On the reverse side, they appear brown to dark brown. The colonies rapidly cover the entire Petri dish. On G25N, the colonies of C. pallescens are 3‚Äì6 mm in diameter, and appear grey and brown in colour. On Dichloran Chloramphenicol Malt Agar (DCMA), the colonies are 50‚Äì65 mm in diameter, and pale brownish-grey in colour. Lastly, colonies of C. pallescens grown on Phenylethyl Alcohol Agar (PEA) appear woolly at the centre. The conidiophores of C. pallescens are rarely branched, and are brown in colour. They can appear slightly bent at the apices, but otherwise they are predominately straight. The dimensions of the conidiophore vary, especially concerning its length. They can be up to 6Œºm wide. The conidia of C. pallescens are rugby or gridiron football- to bean-shaped, and are less curved than those of related species. They appear smooth in texture, and pale-brown to brown in colour. The three septa within each conidium give rise to four cells. The third cell from the base appears swollen in comparison to the surrounding cells. The dimensions of the conidia are 18-25 x 9-12 Œºm. Cochliobolus pallescens is the teleomorphic form of Curvularia pallescens. It produces spherical ascomata that are black in colour. On the surface of the ascomata, there are protruding colourless necks from which the ascospores emerge. Ascospores are produced within cylindrical asci. The ascospores are colourless, and are either straight or slightly curved. Each ascospore contains 6-13 septa. Ecology and growth Curvularia pallescens is commonly found in tropical regions, such as India. They usually grow on unharvested crops (i.e., crops that have not been dried or stored), such as grass, rice, wheat, maize, and sorghum. Optimal growth occurs at 25-30 ¬∞C, and at an aw of 0.976. The minimum aw for growth is 0.89. Germination occurs at 0.855 aw but does not result in the establishment of colonies. Sulphur and phosphorus are macronutrients involved in the production of DNA, RNA and proteins in fungal species. It has been reported that C. pallescens is able to grow and sporulate in the absence of both. Magnesium sulphide and tripotassium phosphate support the growth and sporulation of C. pallescens whereas, ammonium sulphate and ammonium phosphate do not. Physiology Curvularia pallescens acts as a biological reducing agent of AgNO3, resulting in the production of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs). This is considered a green method of Ag NP synthesis, unlike other methods that use chemical agents. Silver nanoparticles have widespread applications in industries such as healthcare, environmental health and drug-gene delivery. Curvularia pallescens has been reported to produce several secondary metabolites‚Äîparticularly, isolates from spirostaphylotrichines and curvupallides. These two groups of secondary metabolites are structurally similar. Isolates of spirostaphylotrichines (i.e., C and D) were found to be phytotoxins whereas, the curvupallide isolates showed no phytotoxic activity. Despite the limited genome sequencing of this fungus, C. pallescens has been found to produce several enzymes with differing immunological and physiological functions in humans. These enzymes include BRN-1, vacuolar protease, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, mannitol-1-phosphate 5-dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, transketolase, peroxidase, catalase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase and 14-3-3 protein. These proteins give C. pallescens its allergenic potential in humans. They have also been reported as allergens of other fungal species, and of species outside the kingdom Fungi. Infection and disease Curvularia pallescens has been reported to cause subcutaneous, pulmonary, and cerebral lesions, in immunocompetent individuals. It is thought that lesions arise as the result of inhalation of soils containing C. pallescens. The human pathogenic potential of C. pallescens stems from its viability and functionality at the normal human body temperature (37 ¬∞C), and its ability to disseminate. In addition to human infection, there have been multiple reported cases of leaf spots caused by C. pallescens, in crops. In particular, infections have occurred in bamboos (such as Bambusa vulgaris, Dendrocalamus longispathus and Thyrsostachys oliveri), sugarcanes, and grasses (such as Imperata arundinacea and Eleusine coracana). The severity of disease and the appearance of the spots differ between species. In B. vulgaris, the leaf spots appear circular or irregular in shape with a greyish-black centre and yellow perimeter. In sugarcane, the leaf spots appear elliptical in shape and light brown in colour. In I. arundinacea and E. coracana, the leaf spots appear irregular in shape and brown to black in colour. Curvularia pallescens invades the host organism via the stomata or proceeding damage. Infection arises as the result of the propagation of hyphae within the host, causing the host cell to rupture. This results in the spotty appearance on the leaf. Over time, the spots combine to form necrotic zones at the leaf tips causing dehydration in those areas. The leaf spots can be controlled by fungicide sprays, such as Mancozeb (0.1%). In addition to leaf spots, infection can result in: the hindrance of germination, inhibited growth of seedlings and mature crops of lesser quality (e.g., fewer grains produced, and the grains that are produced are damaged).

It is mainly found on rotting wood and soil. M. elegans is not pathogenic to humans, animals, or plants.Original line illustration of Penicillium elegans (= Mariannaea elegans), source: ACJ Corda. 1838. Icones fungorum hucusque cognitorum. 2:1-43. History and taxonomy Czech mycologist August Carl Joseph Corda named this species Penicillium elegans in 1838. This species was transferred to the genus Paecilomyces in 1951. Later, in 1952, French mycologist, Gabriel Arnaud named the species Mariannaea elegans although he failed to provide a Latin description, which was a requirement for valid publication at the time. Arnaud noted that the genus Mariannaea shared many characteristics with genus Paecilomyces but was distinguished by the divergent nature of the conidial chains of Mariannaea. This conclusion was supported by Dutch mycologist, Robert Archibald Samson, who in 1974 validated the names of the genus and species by providing Latin diagnoses. The genus Mariannaea currently consists of eight species. Two varieties of M. elegans exist: M. elegans var. elegans and M. elegans var. punicea. Growth and morphology M. elegans is an anamorphic fungus (i.e., it reproduces asexually). When M. elegans is grown on a Petri dish in 2% MEA (Malt Extract Agar; medium used in a Petri dish) and PDA (potato-dextrose agar) at the growth and morphological characteristics listed below are observed. The colonies of M. elegans grows better in MEA than in PDA. On average colonies of M. elegans can be observed with the naked eye having a diameter of 2.5‚Äì6 cm after 10 days of growth. They appear thin and velvety (i.e. smooth) or floccose (i.e. woolly) or matted (i.e. powdery) and are odourless. Sometimes the colonies make a ring shaped pattern as might be seen on a jawbreaker candy. Specimens isolated from wood possess brown colonies whose brown pigment fuses into the surrounding agar. However, specimens isolated from soil possess reddish-purple colonies whose pigmentation does not diffuse in to the agar surrounding the colonies of M. elegans. Colonies are white to cinnamon buff (peanut butter colour ) and possess either smooth or rough walls. The mycelium is either smooth-walled or rough-walled, white to olivaceous (the green colour of the mould on blue cheese) or pink. Conidiophores are arise from mycelia immersed in the agar. They are light brown, with a smooth or verrucose(i.e., bumpy) surface and grow to a maximum of 1000 ¬µm long and reach a maximum of 10 ¬µm in width at the base. Conidiophores can also arise from aerial hyphae. These conidiophores grow to 250 ¬µm in length and 7 ¬µm in width. Additionally, they can grow to reach a maximum of 1400 ¬µm in length and 23 ¬µm in width at their base. The tops narrow to 3-4 ¬µm. Alternatively, conidiophores can grow laterally from ascending mycelium (i.e., the mycelium is not immersed in the agar) or hyphal ropes. On average these conidiophores are smaller than the ones that grow from hypha immersed in agar. They are smooth-walled or rough-walled, hyaline to pale yellowish. Bearing up to 4 diverging branches that are 9-22 ¬µm long and 3-5 ¬µm wide. They may bear secondary branches. Phialides are observed at the apex of the conidiophores and their branches. They are hyaline in colour and possesses a smooth surface and ellipsoidal (i.e. shaped like a football) to fusiform (i.e. spindle) in shape. They are 8-22 x 2.2-3.5 ¬µm in width and they gradually become thinner reaching 0.8-1.4 ¬µm in width at their apex. Growing obliquely form the apex of a phialide are long chains of conidia (singular conidium). Like phialides, they have a smooth surface and are ellipsoidal to fusiform in shape. Their apex is sharply pointed and round at the base, on average 5.3 x 2.7 ¬µm and reaches a maximum of 9.0 x 4.0 ¬µm in width. The two varieties of Mariannaea elegans, M. elegans var. elegans and M. elegans var. punicea, are highly morphologically similar. Colonies of M. elegans var. elegans grow more slowly than those of M. elegans var. punicea. Colonies of the former also tend to develop a brownish colour and ringed pattern whereas those of the latter tend to develop a reddish-purple pigmentation and lacking a ringed pattern. M. elegans var. elegans is most commonly isolated from rotting wood whereas M. elegans var. punicea is only known from soil. The genus 'Mariannaea is closely related to Clonastachys and Gliocladium. They differ from Mariannaea because their conidiophores are clustered tightly together. M. elegans is often misidentified as a member of the genus Paecilomyces because of its morphological similarity. However, the phialides of Mariannaea are flask shaped (thick at the base gradually narrow towards the apex, in cross-section like a canoe paddle) whereas those of Paecilomyces tend to be shorter and stouter (in cross-section like a tennis racquet). Physiology This fungus is not known to be a pathogen of humans, animals, or plants. A study carried out in 2007 revealed anti-M. elegans cutaneous bacterial communities that live on the skin of amphibians. The presence of these bacteria inhibits the growth of M. elegans on amphibians. The species grows optimally at a pH of 7.0; however, it tolerates a pH range of 5.5-8.0. The sporulation phase of M. elegans is sensitive to pH. It sporulates best at a pH range of 6.0-6.5 and below a pH of 5.0 sporulation is reduced. The optimal temperature that it grows in is . However, trances of M. elegans can be founds thriving at . M. elegans produces amylase, beta-glucosidase, cellulase, and protease. It is able to degrade cellulose. When M. elegans is grown in vitro in the presence of different sugars (e.g., glucose, galactose, sucrose, mannose, fructose, and lactose) at for 2 days in PDA distinct cell morphology is observed. Growth in 2% of glucose, galactose, or sucrose leads to the formation of many small fungal cells. Whereas the opposite is observed in 2% of mannose, fructose, or lactose, which lead to the formation of a few large fungal cells. Sugar appears to be an important factor in the growth of M.elegans because in the absence of sugar it experiences a delay in growth. Habitat and ecology M. elegans grows on decaying coniferous bark or wood, forest soil, house dust, prairie and grassland soils, calcareous soil, running water that has little pollution, waste stabilization ponds, acid mine drainage stream, fields treated with digested sewage sludge, in arable soils, and on pine chips. M. elegans has been isolated from various regions in Canada: Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. Both varieties have both been recorded in Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Canada. However, only M. elegans var. elegans has also be found in France, the British Isles, Italy, Poland, and South Africa, whereas, M. elegans var. punicea has exclusively be found in Democratic Republic of the Congo. The ecological role of this species is not well known. It is involved in wood biodeterioration either through the formation of soft rot cavities or through cell wall erosion. It may also incluence the growth of other fungi. For example, at it inhibits mycelial growth in the mushroom, Pholiota microspora; but at it enhances mycelial growth of P. microspora. It is capable of preventing sapstain (a blue to greyish-black colour) formation on wood treated with M. elegans. This is important in the lumber industry because discoloured wood is less versatile and can not be used for some applications. M. elegans has potential implication in humans. A study carried out in 2001 concluded that mariannaeaprone, a fungal metabolite made by M. elegans induces the aggregation of human platelet cells. M. elegans may also be consumed by amoebae.

Previously he was the Executive Associate Dean at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs from 2008-2015 and Director of Public Affairs and Public Policy Ph.D. Programs in the School of Public & Environmental Affairs from 2006-2008. Education and career David Reingold was born in 1968 in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood. He attended the University of Chicago Laboratory High School and received his B.A. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He earned his master's and doctorate from the University of Chicago‚Äôs Department of Sociology. He became an Assistant Professor at Indiana University‚Äôs School of Public and Environmental Affairs in 1997, an Associate Professor with tenure in 2003, a Professor in 2009. He has also served as Visiting Professor at Central European University, School of Public Policy in 2013-2015. In 2006, he was named Director of Public Affairs and Public Policy Ph.D. Programs in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. In 2008, Reingold was named Executive Associate Dean for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs for the campus at Indiana University Bloomington. In 2015, he was named Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University. University leadership In December 2014, Purdue University announced it had named Reingold the next dean of its College of Liberal Arts. He assumed office on March 1, 2015, as the Justin S. Morrill Dean of the College of Liberal Arts at Purdue University. A letter to the College's faculty and staff set the tone for his administration later that spring. In his first year as Dean, Reingold convened a faculty task force to develop an integrated liberal arts program to engage more students across all Purdue majors, particularly those in STEM majors, with the humanities. The result was the Cornerstone Integrated Liberal Arts program, which in September 2020 became the model for an initiative led by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Teagle Foundation to replicate the program's general education delivery at colleges and universities across the country. Launched in fall 2017 as a 15-credit certificate program, Cornerstone established a faculty-taught first year sequence to fulfill core curriculum requirements in oral and written communication built around transformative texts, among the greatest that has been said and written. Cornerstone has gained significant notice in the higher education press. Reingold advocated for the importance of general education classes at large research universities, referencing Cornerstone, in an op-ed for the Washington Post. Also in his first year, Reingold came under fire for efforts to strengthen graduate education by managing graduate student enrollments to help increase stipends to a competitive level. The strategy was part of a larger goal of raising the academic profile of the College. Within three years, Purdue stipends had increased from $14,000 to $18,000. Reingold advocated for undergraduate student career aspirations by creating Job-Ready, an award fund to assist students on unpaid and low-paid career-launching internships. In 2016, the College opened the Liberal Arts Career Center to support student internship and job search. Under his leadership, the College launched Degree in 3, which enables students enrolled in each of the College's 10 academic units the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years. A part of Purdue's commitment to value in higher education, the Degree in 3 plans can save students thousands of dollars and enable them to enter the workforce earlier. Degree in 3 was highlighted in a Bloomberg feature on Purdue President Mitch Daniels. In 2019, the College entered into a partnership with Ivy Tech Community College-Lafayette to create three year bachelor's degree paths for graduates of its ASAP accelerated associates degree program. In September 2018, Purdue launched Degree+, a program created to help students complete a bachelor of arts from the College along with a bachelor of science degree without adding time to degree. Degree+ accepts university core curriculum credits and those from the student's first major to fulfill the breadth required by the liberal arts core. On September 25, 2019, it was announced that Purdue University received a planning grant from Lilly Endowment Inc. to create a model program focused on developing curriculum around professional ethics at the intersection of the liberal arts and technological innovation. Reingold serves as principal investigator for the project. As Executive Associate Dean for the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University-Bloomington (now the Paul H. O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs), Reingold was the chief academic and administrative officer for the Bloomington campus. Under his leadership, the School moved to the top of the U.S. News and World Report rankings in 2016. He doubled the School's total revenue in five years within an RCM budgeting environment and also raised over $4M to launch and support the School's VISTA Fellows Program and the Vietnam Young Leaders Award Program. Public service From 2002-04 he served as Director of the Office of Research and Policy Development for the U.S. Corporation for National and Community Service in Washington D.C. In this senior-level executive position, he headed a division within a $1B federal agency, reporting directly to the CEO, a presidential appointee with U.S. Senate confirmation.

This saprotrophic fungus is found commonly in marine and soil environments. It is abundant in harsh environments like soil contaminated with heavy metals. E. pisciphila forms symbiotic relationships with various plants by colonizing on roots, conferring resistance to drought and heavy metal stress. It is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly causes infections in captive fish and amphibians, while rarely causing disease in humans. Secondary metabolites produced by this species have potential clinical antibiotic and antiretroviral applications. History and taxonomy In 1969, Nikola Fijan first described a systemic mycosis outbreak in channel catfish from a pond in Alabama and identified it as Exophiala salmonis. In 1974, Michael McGinnis and Libero Ajello reevaluated the fungus and identified it as a new species Exophiala pisciphila. The specific epithet pisciphila is a linguistic barbarism, combining the Latin word piscis meaning \\"fish\\" with the Greek suffix -philos (œÜŒØŒªŒøœÇ) meaning \\"loving\\". Habitat and ecology Exophiala pisciphila is commonly found in soil, plants and water in North America, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Australia. E. pisciphila occurs as a colonist or pathogen in cold-blooded vertebrates such as various commercially cultivated fish and amphibians. It has low host specificity. Captive fish are especially susceptible due to the confined space of aquariums and accumulation of fungal particles. Decorative pieces, stones or contaminated food in aquariums can all be reservoirs of E. pisciphila. This fungus has a high tolerance to certain metals ions and has been encountered in harsh environments such as heavy metal polluted soils. When this fungus colonizes plant roots, it enhances plant tolerance to heavy metal ions. Symbiotic relationships with host plants also allow for improved growth performance and plant survival rate in drought conditions. Growth and morphology Exophiala pisciphila is an exclusively asexual fungus that exhibits both filamentous and yeast-like growth. Due to its variable growth forms and the dark pigmentation of its cell walls, it is considered a member of the descriptive grouping of similar fungi known as the black yeasts. E. pisciphila forms slow growing colonies approximately in size which is similar to other species in the genus, E. salmonis and E. brunnea. The texture of the colony is dry and fluffy due to the formation on aerial hyphae in mature colonies. The upper surface is grey to green black in colour while the reverse surface tends to be black. Growth occurs on various media including malt extract agar (MA), oatmeal agar (OA), Sabourand's dextrose agar (SA), corn meal agar (CMA), Czapeck's solution agar, potato dextrose agar (PDA) and nutrient agar (NA). Optimal growth occurs on PDA and MA with the most aerial hyphae forming dome shaped colonies. Media interpreted to be associated with less optimal growth result in the formation of flat colonies. A distinguishing feature of this fungus from others in the genus is its ability to grow on L-arabinitol. Ideal growth conditions for E. pisciphila occur between , where maximum growth occurs at . This differentiates it from E. jeanselmei which has similar physiology otherwise. Reproduction for this species occurs asexually by conidiation which was observed to occur through various means in developing colonies. The conidia are produced either by (1) pre-existing conidia, (2) mature hyphae or (3) the differentiation of the cell into a specialized conidium-producing cell called an annellide. E. pisciphila have smooth-walled conidia with yellow-brown walls that characteristically differentiate into annelides. Annelides are bottle- shaped cells that give rise to conidia from a point at the tip of the bottle- neck, as it were. In this way, annelides are similar to phialides but differ in that their necks incrementally elongate as each successive conidium is borne. The cell walls of this species contain the brown pigment melanin which is both a pathogenicity factor and a mechanism of enhancing cell survival during periods of stress. The developing colonies also produce aerial hyphae that appear as hyphal strands that intertwine in a rope-like fashion. The formation of aerial hyphae has been suggested as a means of enhancing survival during harsh growth conditions. E. salmonis has single-celled conidia that are smaller than those of the otherwise morphologically the similar species, E. brunnea. Pathology Unlike closely related species such as E. jeanselmei and E. dermatitidis, E. pisciphila rarely causes disease in humans primarily due to its inability to tolerate human body temperature. One case of human disease was reported in Brazil where a person undergoing immunosuppressive therapy for a liver transplant developed a skin infection. The infection did not disseminate and resolved with therapy within a month. Uncontrolled asthmatics may manifest hypersensitivity to E. pisciphila antigens. This fungus is pathogenic to an array of aquatic animals most notably freshwater and seawater fish in which infection is associated with the development of skin lesions and nodules on visceral organs. It can cause deadly infections in Atlantic salmon where the hyphae invade the brain causing chronic inflammation. These infections are associated with abnormal swimming behaviours, depression and darkening of skin. Non-salmonid fish such as smooth dogfish, channel catfish, American sole, Cardinal tetra, cod, triggerfish, Japanese flounder, King George whiting, American plaice are also susceptible. Systemic, lethal infections have been described in captive sharks including the zebra, bonnethead and hammerhead sharks. Infections of sharks, rays and skates are typically associated with severe tissue damage especially necrosis of the spleen and gills. Other cold-blooded animals such as turtles, crabs, sea horses and frogs can be affected. E. pisciphila has been implicated as a minor egg pathogen due to its ability to infect a small number of nematode larvae. Isolates have been identified from tongue ulcers of various terrestrial animals such as horses and dogs. Uses E. pisciphila produces Exophilin A, a secondary metabolite identified as a new antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria. Another secondary metabolite produced by this species is a newly discovered polyketide compound 1-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-4-hydroxypentan-2-one which may have antimicrobial activity. A novel fungal metabolite, Exophilic acid, has been isolated which acts as an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase, an enzyme critical for replication and spread of HIV virus. This demonstrates its potential to be used for antiretroviral therapy.

It shows very little pathogenic ability causing confirmed disease in only a few plant species. History and taxonomy Gustav Kunze established the genus Chaetomium in 1817 after discovering a new species of fungus in dead stalks and leaves which he named C. globosum. In 1818, when observing the dead leaves of Typha and Sparganium in Germany, Kunze recognized a new fungus that looked like C. globosum but was darker in pigmentation, and after characterizing it named it Ch. elatum. In addition to Kunze's identification and characterization of the species (in which he failed to discern asci), Robert Greville created illustrations in 1826 to show the morphology of the species. Despite this, C. elatum has been confused by other mycologists many times and thus has been re-described more than any other Chaetomium species, leading to many obligate synonyms. It was during the creation of one of these synonyms, C. lageniforme, by August Corda in 1837 that asci were first recognized, thus identifying the defining feature that placed this fungus in the fungal division, Ascomycota. Growth and morphology C. elatum produces darkly- coloured oval perithecia covered with stiff, black hairs. The perithecia are typically attached firmly to the substratum by dark/black rhizoids. In laboratory colonies C. elatum generally grows 5‚Äì6 mm per day, but can show different growth rates and colour characteristics depending on the growth medium. Under certain growth conditions, colonies of some strains of C. elatum may develop coloured guttation droplets of liquid on their surfaces whose function and composition are unknown. C. elatum has a homothallic mating system. The perithecia are superficial, usually mature in 13 to 20 days, and are 280‚Äì440 Œºm high with a diameter of 255‚Äì380 Œºm. They may appear greenish in color under reflected light with a round/oval-like shape and have an ostiole that is sparsely covered in white/buff aerial hyphae. The perithecial wall is made of brown interwoven hyphae or tightly packed pseudoparenchyma. Morphology of the black/dark perithecium hairs varies depending on their location. Terminal hairs are extremely coarse, branched at right to straight angles, have irregular projections, blunt spines, and dwindle off to thin translucent tips. Lateral hairs are thin, long, unbranched, coarsely roughened by irregular projections and dwindle into translucent smooth tips that are vaguely separate. The difference between the terminal hair of C. elatum and C. globosum is a distinguishing factor between the two taxa. The asci of C. elatum are generally club-shaped and contain 8 round ascospores. The ascospores are translucent/light olive when young and become brown with pointed tips when they mature giving them lemon-like shape when viewed in profile. The ascopores also have a thick wall with a small pore on the outer wall of their apex. Morphology of the ascospores is a distinguishing factor when compared to other Chaetomium species with which it might be confused like C. indicum, C. funicolum, and C. virgecephalum. The asexual morph of C. elatum has acremonium-like growth, with its conidia being borne on phialidic conidiophogeous cells that form on aerial aseptate hyphae and are 6‚Äì24.5 Œºm long with a diameter of 1.5‚Äì3.5 Œºm at the base. Conidium dimensions are 2.5‚Äì5.5 Œºm √ó 1.5‚Äì2.5 Œºm and they form towards the base of the conidiosphore in chains, are translucent, smooth, and oval-shaped with a rounded apex and short base. Habitat and ecology C. elatum is a very common and widely distributed species of Chaetomium, with it being found all over the world. The species has been found in many areas of the United States, Canada, England, France, Russia, Switzerland, Germany, Scotland, the Galapagos Islands and many other localities. It is the most common species of fungi that grows on damp rotting straw, but has also been found and isolated from a variety of materials like rope, burlap, wood, paper, cellulose products, animal dung, seeds, barrel hoops, old brooms, Hordeum vulgare L, Triticum aestivum and the dead leaves of Typha and Sparganium. In general this species of Chaetomium mainly colonizes cereal, Alkali seepweed, True grasses, has been found to interact with Japanese yew, Alkali seepweed, European rabbit, Bread wheat, True grasses, Corn. It has also been associated with the mycobiota of Sugarcane as well as is known as a root-colonizing fungus in the avocado plant where it serves as both a rhizoplane and rhizophere. Biotechnology uses C. elatum has been isolated from different materials and its metabolic properties with potential biotechnology uses have been explored. In the presence of nitrocellulose (a very important cellulose derivative).C. elatum can break down nitrocellulose in liquid culture. Investigations into the types of metabolites produced by this fungus have found that it produces benzoquinone derivatives, tetra-S-methyl derivatives, anthraquinone-chromanone, orsellinic acid, globosumones, sterols Chaetoglobsins, Cochliodones 1-3 (azaphilone derivatives), azaphilones, chlorinated phenolic glycosides, and xanthoquinodins. Xanthoquinodins are fungal metabolites that have been found to have antibacterial, antifungal, anticoccidial, antiplasmodial, and cytotoxic activities. Azaphilones have antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antioxidant, cytotoxic, nematicidal and anti-inflammatory properties, and the three metabolized by C. elatum have also been found to inhibit Caspase 3 which is involved in cell death. Phenolic compounds have shown to possess antimicrobial properties. Chaetoglobosins has been found to have anticancer activity, and benzoquinone derivatives have antibacterial properties. Nnanoparticles harvested from crude extracts of the C. elatum exhibit antimicrobial activity against Magnaporthe grisea, the plant pathogen that causes rice blast disease. Plant pathogenicity C. elatum is a known pathogen of the common grape vine. In 2007, an investigation to determine its pathogenicity on avocado plants found that it opportunistically colonizes the plant roots and only becomes pathogenic when resources are very limited and intraspecific competition is high.

It has four parts and its main amendments involve how courts define and respond to allegations of child abuse and domestic violence.  Origins  The Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 was introduced to the Australian Parliament on 24 March 2011 and came into effect on 7 June 2012. It was implemented in an attempt to respond to the criticisms of the Family Law Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006 by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, Professor Richard Chisholm and Family Law Council, who all conducted inquiries into the 2006 Act. Professor Chisholm's \\"Family Courts Violence Review\\" concluded that the 2006 Family Law Amendment Act's introduction of a shared parental responsibility provision had been misinterpreted by courts and parents as a provision for equal shared care time and had led to parents considering only \\"their own entitlements rather than what was best for their children\\". Further, the Australian Institute of Family Studies inquiry \\"Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms\\" suggested that the friendly parent provisions had increased the likelihood of a child remaining with a family member who exposed them to family violence. Charles Pragnell from the National Council for Children Post-Separation argued that this occurred as the provision led to \\"mothers remain[ing] silent about domestic violence\\" and judges \\"seeing the right of shared care as the principle overriding consideration...giving custody of children to convicted pedophiles and violent offenders\\". Based on these inquiries, the Australian Law Reform Commission called for the 2006 Act to be amended. This led to the implementation of the Family Law Legislation Amendment Act in 2011.  Major features  The Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 contains two schedules: \\"Schedule 1- Amendments relating to family violence\\" and \\"Schedule 2- Other amendments\\", which are each divided into two further parts. = New definitions = Schedule 1 of the Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 redefined both family violence and child abuse. It redefined family violence to include \\"controlling actions\\" and removed the condition that a person must \\"reasonably\\" fear for their personal security. In section 4AB it redefined family violence as \\"violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person‚Äôs family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful\\". Further, the Act provided an extensive but not exhaustive list of instances of family violence in its new sub-section 4AB(2), which include instances of stalking and repeated derogatory taunts. It also specifies that exposure to family violence occurs when a child sees of hears family violence and listed examples of possible situations of exposure. In redefining child abuse, the Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 listed two new categories of behaviour that constitute as abuse; serious neglect and actions that cause serious physiological harm. = Primary consideration = The Family Law Amendment Act 2006 introduced the provision that equal shared responsibility for both parents is the optimal interest of the child. This was based on two of the child's rights, first, their right to have an ongoing relationship with both of their parents and, second, the child's right to be safe from abuse and harm. In subsection 60CC(2) the Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 included a provision that if a conflict arises between the two primary best interest considerations, the requirement to ensure a child is safe from harm should be prioritised over the concern for a child's relationship with both parents. This meant that the requirement that a child be protected from abuse became the primary consideration of the court. = Removal of the friendly parent provision = The Family Law Amendment Act 2006 included a provision that required the court to consider how supportive each child's parents were of an supporting an ongoing relationship between their child and the other parent when determining what is best for the child, referred to as the \\"friendly parent provision\\" by legal practitioners. The Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 removed this provision from the consideration of the court. = Firmer guidelines for dealing with family violence = The Family Law Legislation Amendment Act 2011 introduced new provision that the court, legal practitioners, and others must comply with when dealing with the prospect or reality of family violence allegations. These provisions include the requirement that if any party is aware than the child has been the subject of a notification, report, investigation, inquiry or assessment relating to child abuse they must inform the court. Further, the Act specifies that the court must expressly ask all parties in the court if they are aware of or concerned about abuse of the child by their guardians or family members.  Significant cases  = Martin v Martin = In the case Martin v Martin [2014] FCCA 2838 the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act's expansion of the definition of family violence to include repeated stalking meant that the court granted sole parental responsibility to the mother and prevented the father from going to the child's school or home. The court stated that the father's actions of repeatedly calling the mother late a night, honking his car outside her home and arriving at her children's activities without warning constituted as an \\"ongoing campaign\\" of stalking. It found that this behaviour was undertaken with the intent to control and intimidate the mother. The judge concluded that as the Act states that the need to protect a child from harm is the priority of the Family Court and stalking constitutes as family violence the father should be denied access to his children. =Oakes v Oakes= In the case Oakes v Oakes [2014] FamCA 285 the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act's elevation of the provision that a child be protected from harm to primary consideration resulted in the court granting sole parental responsibility to the mother. The case concerned a three year old whose mother was seeking sole parental responsibility and an arrangement where the father would have no contact with his daughter while the father desired a shared time arrangement. Under the Act, the court was required to ask if any party held the belief that the daughter was at risk of abuse. By doing so it was revealed that the father had \\"made clear and unambiguous threats to kill the mother\\" and had been domestically abusive before, during and after the separation. The judge argued that the father presented \\"an unacceptable risk to the child\\" and cited the \\"need to protect the child from harm\\" as the main reason he granted sole responsibility to the mother, banning the father from any contact. = Tindall v Saldo = In the case Tindall v Saldo [2015] FamCAFC the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act's removal of the \\"friendly parent provision\\" in section 60CC(3) of the Family Law Amendment Act 2006 resulted in the Family Court considering the mother's attempts to prohibit a continued relationship between her child and its father as \\"protective in nature\\". The mother had appealed against the Family Court's initial decision that she disobeyed court orders, by preventing her child from having supervised time with the father, without a \\"reasonable excuse\\". However, in the appeal the court argued that, as this breach occurred while the father was undergoing a criminal trial for domestic and sexual abuse that created a \\"palpable change in the underlying family dynamic\\", the mother had acted out of a desire to protect the child from harm. The court claimed that the mother's two day testimony and the father's guilty plea provided reasonable grounds for the mother to have believed she needed to separate the child from its father and that based on the removal of the \\"friendly parent provision\\" the court's priority should not be the efforts made by each parent to ensure a continued relationship between their child and the other parent. Hence, the original judgment was set aside.  Influence  = Australian Institute of Family Studies Review = In a survey of over 315 lawyers, conducted by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, the percentage of family law lawyers who agreed that \\"the family violence reforms have benefitted children in most cases\\" increased from 29.5% to 48.3% between 2008 and 2014. During that time the Family Law Legislation Amendment Act was the only family violence reform. Further, the percentage of family law lawyers who believe the reforms \\"have resulted in fewer children in shared care arrangements where there is high conflict\\" has increased from 16% to 42.5% in the same time period. The review by the Australian Institute of Family Studies approved of the amendment that made the need to protect children from harm the Family Court's primary considerations, as did 86% of the respondents surveyed, respondents included parents who had dealt with family courts, legal practitioners, lawyers and judges. There was less consensus among respondents on whether \\"protection from harm is accorded greater weight when relevant\\" in the Family Courts, only 70% of the respondents agreed. = Australian Law Reform Commission = The Australian Law Reform Commission has critiqued the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act's failure to address its two of its major recommendations, first, the removal of the mandatory attendance of both parents at Family Dispute Resolution Services and, second, the introduction of a clarification that equal shared parental responsibility does not refer to equal time. Under the Family Law Amendment Act 2006, a court requires a certificate of attendance from Family Dispute Resolution Services that states both parents attended a compulsory mediation session before it can hear a case relating to the custody of a child. While there are exemptions for cases with accusations of family violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission stated in its inquiry into the 2006 Family Law Amendment Act that the family dispute resolution process is \\"weighted heavily\\" against women, particularly those who have been victims of domestic abuse, leading to women being \\"manipulated into agreeing with unjust settlements\\". The 2006 Family Law Amendment Act also includes a specification that the presumption of shared parental responsibility means the Family Court is obliged \\"to consider\\" implementing a custody arrangement that grants both parents equal time or \\"substantial and significant time\\", which has been critiqued by the Australian Law Reform Commission and was not amended in the 2011 Family Law Legislation Amendment Act. The Australian Law Reform Commission has claimed that this specification has created \\"widespread misunderstanding\\", leading parents to believe that children must spend equal or significant time with both parents. Child protection campaigner Emeritus Professor Freda Briggs has stated that the child being protected from harm \\"must be elevated to the single primary and paramount consideration\\", otherwise the \\"risk of ongoing exposure to domestic violence\\" will remain.  Proposed reform  On 31 August 2018 the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Act 2018 received its royal assent. The 2018 Act removed the twenty-one day time limit on the \\"revival, variation or suspension of family law orders by state and territory courts\\" in cases involving family violence and specified that a court needn't give an explanation of an order or injunction to a child if receiving such an explanation is not in the child's best interest. On 20 May 2018 the Attorney-General Christian Porter announced that the Family Court and Federal Circuit Court will be combined in order to reduce the, on average, \\"year and a half\\" wait for families to get their cases heard by a judge. Rick O‚ÄôBrien, the chair of Family Law Section of the Law Council of Australia, has described this wait as a \\"crisis\\" that \\"drastically increases the likelihood of a child being exposed to family violence\\" . The Australian Government estimates that by combining the two courts an extra 8,000 cases will be completed each year. There doesn't currently exist proposed reform that addresses the concerns listed by the Australian Law Reform Commission (see Influence section).

Contributing factors Some of the largest contributing factors to the low level of food security throughout Niger include high priced essential food, susceptible crops, drought and soil infertility. The United Nations estimates that 3.4 million Nigeriens are suffering from food insecurity with around half the population of children under the age of 5 being classified as chronically malnourished. Large contributing factors to this problem are inadequate agricultural production and the limited financial resources that the government of Niger has. Areas of the country such as Zinder, Maradi, Tillab√©ri, Tahoua, and Dosso are categorized as \\"high risk\\" livelihood zones; these regions all have experienced unpredictable rain and less access to food. These are also some of the areas where food insecurity is the most prevalent due to the vulnerable state of the agro-pastoral regions. In 2017 Niger received a 29 on the Global Food Security Index; placing them in 110 out 113 countries. Despite foreign intervention, poor households in Niger are desperate to maintain their current food consumption levels; resorting to migration, borrowing and sale of livestock. This presents additional problems for these families; current exchange rates discourage selling of livestock from Niger to Nigeria which represents the main target market. In addition to unfavorable markets, Niger is susceptible to food shortages due to climate changes. During seasons of poor rainfall, it is estimated that nearly 30 percent of the population are unable to meet their food needs. In 2012 it was estimated that a population of around 1.3 million people were in need of immediate assistance due to food insecurity as a direct result of unpredictable rain and sub-par agricultural yield. The UN has identified 1.4 million people in need of food and 1.7 million people who need nutrition support countrywide. Poor rainfall has also affected the amount of land dedicated to grow staple agriculture such as millet; which have decline from 25 percent to 12 percent of the country since the 1960s. Niger struggles to produce and supply food during unfavorable climate conditions which contributes to the population in Niger who suffer from food insecurity. In addition to dwindling land resources, food prices are also rising rapidly; the price of staple grains doubled in 2011, leaving many families in Niger unable to afford them. It is predicted that by the beginning of 2019 many susceptible populations throughout the Diffa region will experience Stressed and Crisis levels of food insecurity based on the criteria outlined in the IPC. Some of the food that Nigeriens do have access to is of lower quality. With diets poor in necessary nutrients, illnesses and diseases become more prevalent. Around 73 percent of children under 5, as well as, 46 percent of women who are of childbearing age are anemic due to diets low in vitamins and essential minerals. According to the Demographic and Health Survey the leading causes of child mortality rates are malaria at 27 percent, cough and cold at 19 percent, pneumonia at 11 percent and diarrhea at 10 percent. There is an inversely proportional correlated trend of food intake with diseases such as malaria, hepatitis, cholera and measles due to weakened immune systems associated with inadequate food intake. Another notable factor is the actual composition of Niger population. A substantial amount of the entire population is under the age of 15. Niger's high fertility rates are a result of unbridled population growth, which increases the difficulty of developing the country.  Security threats  The inconsistent rainfall and low access to quality meals that has affected Niger within recent years is not the only contributing factor to the rate of food insecurity. Political conflict and border security also pose a significant threat to food security. Violence such as the Boko Haram crisis, displaced thousands of Nigeriens near the Lake Chad Basin while at the same time Niger is exposed to an influx of refugees from Mali and Nigeria. Resulting in a larger population competing for dwindling resources such as food and arable land. The World Food Programme estimates that in 2017 half the population in the Diffa region is in need of humanitarian assistance with about 308,000 people who are considered food insecure. Political conflicts and violence in Northern Nigeria has also made its way into Niger; adding to the food insecurity problems as well as endangering local communities. These conflicts disrupted activities essential for livelihood, agriculture and trade through out southern regions in Niger. In areas where violence is especially prevalent such as the northern area of Nigeria there are a few reports of humanitarian aid workers being executed. These incidents can often complicate future aid programs for these target areas. As a result of the violence, more than half a million children near and throughout the Lake Chad Basin area suffer from food insecurity and are considered malnourished. Households in the Tillaberi and Diffa regions typically have lower access to food compared to the rest of the country.  Humanitarian assistance  With the support of various foreign institutions such as the World Bank, there are plans addressing the growing concern, including a $20 monthly payment plan to women in high risk homes that will allow them to buy more food and improve their food security. These interventions are more long term; as very short-term solutions do not appear to solve any problems beyond the length of time that they are implemented. The World Bank is not alone in their attempts to alleviate food insecurity in Niger; there is also the work being done by the World Food Programme. One of the strategies pursued by the World Food Programme is community-based asset aid. This encourages the production of land rehabilitation, specifically in regions that are extremely sensitive to climate conditions. Members of the Mercy Corps organization were deployed at places prone to food insecurity in Niger in order to monitor food levels and malnutrition to reduce response time in the event of an emergency. The USAID's Food for Peace office has contributed roughly $203.7 million between 2016 through 2018. Other tactics being deployed in Niger involve the creation of short-term jobs, maintaining the health of local livestock and working with the general population to build more climate resistant communities. The UN 2018 Humanitarian Response Plan for Niger calls for $338 million; with a majority of that money targeted towards helping to provide food security and nutrition assistance across the country. To reduce the levels of malnourishment observed, children considered malnourished are often treated with iron, folic acid and vitamin A systematically. The World Food Programme states that in 2015 humanitarian assistance provided 200,000 children with school meals across 1,250 schools.

Overview View of lunar swirls BOLAS is a mission concept under study at NASA, with the goal of understanding the cycle of hydrogen on the Moon and to determine the formation mechanism of the lunar swirls. The mission would involve two small CubeSat satellites connected with a long space tether.Using Paraffin PCM for Thermal Management of BOLAS Planetary CubeSats with Ion Thrusters. Michael K. Choi.

Without a tether system, a comparable low-altitude mission would need prohibitive amounts of fuel to maintain its orbit. The two tethered spacecraft would be placed at a 30¬∞ orbit inclination and would remain stable for more than one year. The two CubeSats are 6 units each and would be equipped with nearly identical miniaturized instruments. The mission would use the subsystems developed by Kentucky's Morehead State University, which is leading NASA's Lunar IceCube mission. The team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center was selected in August 2017 to further mature the concept. A bolas is a type of throwing weapon used by South American gauchos made of weights on the ends of interconnected cords. Its application in aerospace is called space bolas or momentum exchange tether. Objectives The BOLAS mission would investigate the lunar hydrogen cycle by determining the mechanisms and dynamics of lunar hydrogen implantation, and their dependence on surface composition, regolith properties, local topography, plasma conditions, time-of-day, and crustal magnetic fields. The second main objective is to understand the role that magnetic anomalies and space weathering could play in the formation of lunar swirls ‚Äî enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface.A Miniature Lunar Sky Crane Could Help Solve the Mystery of the Moon's 'Tattoos'. Calla Cofield, Space.com. 3 September 2017. The mission would also study regolith, local topography, plasma conditions, and magnetic fields within the crust. Scientists think the lunar swirls form as a result of magnetic fields in the lunar crust, which protect the lighter-colored regolith either by diverting solar wind, or through the interaction with electric fields. The Principal Investigator for the BOLAS mission is Timothy Stubbs, at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Spacecraft Busek's BIT-3 ion thruster operating on several propellants The two CubeSats are 6 units each, measuring 36√ó26√ó43 cm each, not including their deployable solar panels. The higher satellite is called BOLAS-H, and the lower one is BOLAS-L. Both would operate independently and possess their own propulsion featuring two Busek BIT-3 RF ion engines each. They would also feature an attitude control system (ACS), and an X band transponder for communication. The 25 kilometer long space tether joining the two satellites is made of a commercially available high tenacity yarn with a thickness of 125 Œºm that is braided for redundant tensile strength. =Science instruments= The two CubeSats are 6 units each and would be equipped with nearly identical miniaturized instruments: * Energetic Neutral Atom Imager (ENAI) (lower CubeSat only) to detect neutralized solar wind. * Ion spectrometer for measuring protons (H+). * Magnetometer to measure local magnetic fields. * Plasma Wave System (PWS) for measuring electron concentrations, electric fields, and dust impacts. * Camera.

The Germans captured a number after The Fall of France and operated them throughout the war. History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design Influenced by the success and failures of the Canon de 274 mod√®le 93/96 Berceau the French Army decided to convert other large caliber guns to railway guns. Unlike the mle 93/96, the Canon de 274 mod√®le 87/93 Glissement did not have a carriage traversing mechanism, it did not have an armored cab for its gun crew and it had a sliding recoil carriage mount. Despite using a smaller propellant charge and having lower muzzle velocity than its predecessor the mle 87/93's greater angle of elevation +40¬∞ vs +25¬∞ gave it better range. The mle 87/93 started life as Canon de 274 mod√®le 1887/1893 naval guns which were used as secondary armament on pre-dreadnought battleships such as the Bouvet and Mass√©na. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period with several layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the gun the barrel lowered and a shell was brought forward by an elevated hoist to the rear of the carriage from an attached ammunition wagon. The carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two five-axle railroad bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. Since the carriage did not have a traversing mechanism it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. World War I The first four guns were completed by Schneider and delivered to the French Army during 1917. They saw heavy use and after 500 shots they were bored out to and provided with new ammunition. One 274 mm and two 285 mm guns were lost during the war.  World War II  During 1919-1920 a number of new guns were finished and placed storage in case they were needed again. The guns were redesignated Canon de 274 mod√®le 1917 √† glissement. At the outbreak of the Second World War France mobilized sixteen mle 1887/93 guns. Four guns each were assigned to the 10th and 11th batteries of the Heavy Artillery Regiment 372¬∞ of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e). Four guns each were assigned to the 4th battery of the Heavy Artillery Regiment 373¬∞ of the ALVF at Vendenheim and Kutzenhausen, France. While the 5th battery of the Heavy Artillery Regiment 373¬∞ of the ALVF may have been stationed at Mommenheim, France. After The Fall of France the Germans used six until the end of the war under the designations 27.4cm K(E) 591(f), 27.4cm K(E) 592(f) and 28.5cm K(E) 605(f).

It is one of few nations that have abolished their nation's armed forces. Having had a stable past, this country has been successful in developing its economy. However, since 2000 there has been a significant rise in criminal activity. Increase in domestic illegal activity, such as theft, homicide, and organised crime, has overwhelmed the local population. Sebastian Huhn reports that, \\"In a public opinion poll in 2011, 45 percent of Costa Rican respondents said that crime and insecurity were the country‚Äôs biggest social problems.\\" As a consequence of the overall societal changes, domestic-driven crime has been increasing in the environment that extends beyond traditional settings. Illegal activity, including distribution of weapons has been most commonly witnessed during the sporting events by 'barras' or fan clubs. Crime in Costa Rica, thus, is not only due to domestic crime groups but also transnational criminal organisations.Map of Costa Rica As Vice President Laura Chinchilla described in March 2008: > '' \\"Costa Rica was known in the world as a nation of peace and tolerance. > Over the course of our history, we (have) learned to solve our differences > and conflicts through dialogue and with respect for others. These > distinctive traits have been challenged in recent years by the increase of > crime and violence.\\"  Types of crime  = Crimes targeting tourists = \\"Nearly 3 million people visited Costa Rica in 2017, and overall they spent $3.87 billion during their stay.\\" Crime in Costa Rica that impacts tourists is usually in form of petty theft and occasional armed robberies. Especially at night tourists need to observe a high degree of precaution. Additionally, murder and sexual assault have also been types of crime that have been committed against tourists. Cases of Arancha Guti√©rrez and Mar√≠a Trinidad Mathus, both occurring in August 2018, are the most recent examples of tourists suffering from the rise in criminal activity. These cases of murder and assault, respectively, indicate that crimes are escalating and are becoming quite severe. These cases additionally highlight the lack of punishment that offenders receive. For example, the two individuals linked to the Mathus case were arrested; however, one was released due to lack of evidence, and the other was sentenced to three months of pretrial detention. Similarly, in case of Arancha Guti√©rrez, the man suspected and linked to the assault was released without any charges, and was transferred to the custody of the immigration police for being in the country illegally. In August 2018, Tourism Minister Maria Amalia Revelo commented on the adverse impact that these deaths and assaults could have on tourism and the need for more police presence. The minister also highlighted the restrictions on her office's ability to respond to crimes due to the Costa Rican government's fiscal policy issues. Security Minister Micheal Soto also remarked that the nation's image has already been damaged, which is reflected in the decrease in tourism. = Homicide = \\"The nation of about five million people, still regarded as being one of the safest as compared to others in Central America, saw 603 homicides last year, according to preliminary data from the police service responsible for investigating them.\\". Previously, 2015 was the year in which homicide rates were the highest. Currently, the Costa Rican Star reports that there has been a decline in the rate of homicide in areas throughout Costa Rica. Most notably, this decline is in the areas of San Jose and Guanacaste, wherein numbers have reduced by 19% and 62% respectively. As of early 2018, 48% of the homicides accounted for in Costa Rica were linked to drug-related gang violence, with 25% being related to drug trafficking. = Organised crime & drug-related crime= Costa Rica's main problem with drug trafficking relates to its geography and its prime maritime network that facilitates drug trafficking on an international scale. Costa Rica's maritime jurisdiction is more than 11 times the size of its land mass, rendering it even more difficult to police and monitor trading activity. It has been reported that ‚ÄúBetween 2000 and 2015, the country‚Äôs murder rate nearly doubled from 6.3 to 11.5 per 100,000 citizens. Up to 70 percent of the violence has been associated with territorial battles between local drug gangs.‚Äù. Additionally, Michael Porth reported that Costa Rica has had a history of drug trafficking and money laundering since the mid-1980s. This has progressively worsened over the years and has become more reactionary to other international factors such as the United States' increase in border control and anti-drug operations. These operations have caused the drug trafficking organisations to use Costa Rica as their ‚Äòpit-stop‚Äô and preferred laundering area. The geography of the land makes it a prime location for hiding and transporting drugs. For example, the area of Limon that lies along the coast not only holds one of the main seaports but is also the main locale for drug trafficking. Additionally, the areas of the Gulf of Punta Arenas and Puerto Quepos, which lie on the Pacific coast, are used as refueling stops for shipments coming from neighboring areas of Colombia and Panama. This issue has aggravated to the point that the Costa Rican Minister of Public Security, Jos√© Mar√≠a Tijerino Pacheco, has stated that without aid and intervention from nations such as the United States, ‚Äú...the region is going to degenerate into another Mexico.‚Äù. The 2017 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report also highlighted the issue of money laundering occurring through banks. In March and April 2011, it was reported that nine Guatemalans who were linked to Mexican drug trafficking organisations were detained at the Paso Canoas and Pe√±as Blancas border crossings. A common issue that has underpinned drug trafficking is the change of influence of the neighboring nations. Influence has shifted from more group-orientated drug trafficking from Colombia to relatively prevalent independent and smaller groups as per the influence of the Mexican drug trafficker. Lack of resources and defence has been recognized by the government as the key factor in the inability to prevent and weaken the amount of drug trafficking that is occurring in Costa Rica. The Chamber of Commerce officials in Punta Arenas outlined that the drug cartels have come to portray themselves as fishing businesses and use strategies of coercion, either with or without weaponry or by paying other fisherman, to get the illicit substances on land. Most legitimate businesses, from farms to transport services, have been bought by Mexican cartels in the attempt to hide and transport cocaine. Further, production of cannabis is also an issue in Costa Rica, particularly in an area called Talamanca. This remote area has also been highlighted as being involved with the trafficking of cocaine.  Crime prevention  = Government intervention =  Historically  Discourse around crime rates in Costa Rica progressed throughout the late 1990s in an emotive manner and became more evident through the change in leadership, most notably through presidents Figueres, and Rodr√≠guez. For example, in a speech by Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez, he highlights the state of the prisons and the need for development of social policy and security. > \\"The action against crime has made it necessary to expand the capacity of > the prisons.... To restore tranquility and seguridad ciudadana it will be > essential to reform legislation, to help the police fight criminals and to > avoid impunity... The people demand harsher laws against crime, ladies and > gentlemen. I therefore ask you with humility and vehemence to answer those > demands by passing these laws without delay\\" Academics highlight that the perception of crime and its prevalence was to an extent manufactured by the government as a means to support the strict legislation that they put in place. Additionally, it is also suggested that the accuracy of statistics about the criminal activity occurring could be worse due to police violence.  Currently  = Legislation that aims to prevent drug related activities = General Health Law (Law 5395) * Aims to prevent and prohibit the cultivation, production and trafficking of drugs. Narcotics And Psychotropic Substances law (Law 8204) now reformed in 2009 to the ‚ÄúLaw on Narcotics, Psychotropic Substances, Unauthorised Drugs, Related Activities, Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism‚Äù. * Outlines the crimes in a detailed manner and includes provisions through which penalties are determined and meted out. * UNDOC most notably highlights that a key progressive element of the Law 8204 is the reform of Article 77 which accounts for a gender perspective. In this, it does not set a minimum punishment, but rather relies on judicial discretion to set a sentence for women. This reform recognized the prevalence and likelihood of women in poverty having to participate in drug trafficking out of necessity or as an escape from threatening circumstances. A recent study conducted by Oya Dursun-√ñzkanca outlined five key problems with the reforms made to the Security Sector. These include the size of the police force, lack of resources, adequate training, especially for security matters that extended beyond their normal jurisdictions and fragmentation among organisations. In an interview with the New York Times, it was reported by the coast guards in Puntarenas that they lacked adequate boating equipment to stop and search most of the skiffs that cross the waters. This problem exists across all key ports in Costa Rica, as out of the 26 boats involved in the maritime security, only 14 function (as of 2011) = Cost of crime = > \\"Violent crime costs Central America an estimated $6.5 billion a year, > equivalent to 7.7 percent of gross domestic product in the region, according > to the study carried out in El Salvador...In total, the costs of violence > amounted to $2.29 billion in Guatemala, $2.01 billion in El Salvador, $791 > million in Costa Rica and $529 million in Nicaragua.\\" It has been outlined that due to multiple decades of social programs and the allocation of funding towards more progressive social change, Costa Rica, in comparison to other nations in Central America, incurs lower cost when it comes to negating the consequences of crime. = Partnerships and bilateral agreements = UNODC-WCO container control program and regional training  In 2013, in collaboration with UNODC and the World Customs Organization, Costa Rican Government \\"joined the Container Control Program after signing a memorandum of understanding with UNODC\\". The main purpose of this project was to target illegal drug trafficking, smuggling and any main illegal activity taking place at the Port of Caldera (Puerto Caldera). In July 2013, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNDOC) and the World Customs Organisation (WCO) provided training to Costa Rican customs officials with the intention of enhancing the ability of border patrol to recognize illicit substances immediately. This aided in creating an infrastructure for governments to detect illicit materials and increase responsiveness of certain maritime ports, which was the core aim of the Container Control Program. The Program was originally signed in 2010 and was supposed to be upheld only for three years. Due to the positive results that became evident from the program, an extension of this period was requested. ‚Äú.... Since its beginning in 2010 through July 2013, this Unit has achieved seizures of 1.6 tons of drugs, 9 containers with counterfeit goods of major brands and 2 containers of tax fraud.‚Äù.  Cooperation program between Latin American, The Caribbean and the European Union on Drug Policy (COPLAD)  Purpose of this partnership is to improve the impact and the consistency of drug policy among nations. In 2017, the Costa Rican Drug Institute (Instituto Costarricense sobre Drogas, ICD) hosted the first meeting of the working group of Latin American countries which was aimed at establishing a criterion on prevention. The meeting was successful in the sense that the attendees incorporated individual drug policies and strategies across multiple nations and were able to become more uniform in their public policy. In 2018, it was announced that the COPLAD organisation has and will be working with other organisations such as WHO, PAHO, EMCDDA and the UNODC, to support new plans to provide improved health services for those who use drugs. This plan will be implemented in all CELAC states, including Costa Rica.  Aid from the United States of America  Previously, the American Drug Enforcement Administration has aided in some of the largest seizures of illicit substances. As of 2018, the U.S. Embassy in San Jose, Costa Rica, has announced funding to be integrated over the next two years. This funding is aimed towards enhancing and supporting US government objectives, and to this effect, it focuses on the enhancement of security and government organization. An element of this is a part of a preexisting project, namely Central American Security Initiative (CCARSI), which partners with nations within Central America to reduce organised crime.

She was the youngest of the seven children of the civil engineer James Barton and his wife Catherine Frances Barton (n√©e Golding). The family moved to Farndreg House, west of Dundalk in 1863, where Barton spent the rest of her childhood. Barton's mother died on her second birthday. Her father remarried to Mary Hewson in 1870, with whom he had six more children who survived to adulthood. She was educated at Southsea and Boulogne, moving to London in 1895 to attend the Westminster School of Art. She then travelled to Rome in 1898, where she taught and studied art. Upon her return to Ireland she began to give art lessons to groups of women in country houses, teaching in five locations in 1900. In 1900 she exhibited with Royal Hibernian Academy, and with the Belfast Art Society in 1902. She was a member of the Women's International Art Club, and briefly of the Watercolour Society of Ireland. Barton held a joint exhibition with Ina Clogstoun at the Fine Art Society in 1902 entitled Irish life and scenery. She exhibited there again in 1905. In 1904 two of her paintings, Autumn in Muckross and A cypress avenue, were included in Hugh Lane's exhibition of Irish art at London's Guildhall. She visited family members in India in 1905, going on to visit Nepal. In 1909 she made an extended trip across Mexico. Her paintings from this trip resulted in an exhibition at the Fine Art Society in 1909 called Mexico: watercolours. She also wrote an article for The Studio on her experiences in Mexico in 1910, and produced an illustrated book Impressions of Mexico (1911). In 1914 she travelled to Canada, and in 1929 she visited Portugal and France. Throughout this time she exhibited, with her paintings shown in Liverpool, Durban, Leeds, Venice, Vienna and Paris.

Cottle (29 June 1934 ~ ) is an American mathematician. He was a professor of Management Science and Engineering at Stanford University, starting as an Acting Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering in 1966 and retiring in 2005. He is notable for his work on mathematical programming/optimization, ‚ÄúNonlinear programs‚Äù, the proposal of the linear complementarity problem, and the general field of operations research.  Life and career  = Early Life and Family = Richard W. Cottle was born in Chicago on 29 June 1934 to Charles and Rachel Cottle. He started his elementary education in the neighboring village of Oak Park, Illinois and graduated from Oak Park-River Forest High School. After that, admitted to Harvard, Cottle began by studying government (political science) and taking premedical courses. After the first semester, he changed his major to mathematics in which he earned his bachelor's (cum laude) and master's degrees. Around 1958, he became interested in teaching secondary-level mathematics. He joined the Mathematics Department at the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts where he spent two years. Midway through the latter period, he married his wife, Suzanne. = Career = While teaching at Middlesex School, he applied and was admitted to the PhD program in mathematics at the University of California at Berkeley, with the intention of focusing on geometry. Meanwhile, he also received an offer from the Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley as a part-time computer programmer. Through that work, some of which involved linear and quadratic programming, he became aware of the work of George Dantzig and Philip Wolfe. Soon thereafter he became a member of Dantzig's team at UC Berkeley Operations Research Center (ORC). There he had the opportunity to investigate quadratic and convex programming. This developed into his doctoral dissertation under the guidance of Dantzig and Edmund Eisenberg. Cottle's first research contribution, \\"Symmetric Dual Quadratic Programs,\\" was published in 1963. This was soon generalized in the joint paper \\"Symmetric Dual Nonlinear Programs,\\" co-authored with Dantzig and Eisenberg. This led to the consideration of what is called a \\"composite problem,\\" the first-order optimality conditions for symmetric dual programs. This in turn, was named \\"the fundamental problem\\" and still later (in a more general context) \\"the complementarity problem.\\" A special case of this, called \\"the linear complementarity problem\\", is a major part of Cottle's research output. Also in 1963, he was a summer consultant at the RAND Corporation working under the supervision of Philip Wolfe. This resulted in the RAND Memo, RM-3858-PR, \\"A Theorem of Fritz John in Mathematical Programming.\\" In 1964, upon completion of his doctorate at Berkeley, he worked for Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey. In 1965, he was invited to visit Stanford's OR Program, and in 1966, he became an Acting Assistant Professor of Industrial Engineering at Stanford. The next year he became an Assistant Professor in Stanford's new Department of Operations Research. He became an Associate Professor in 1969 and Full Professor in 1973. He chaired the department from 1990 to 1996. During 39 years on the active faculty at Stanford he had over 30 leadership roles in national and international conferences. He served on the editorial board of 8 scholarly journals, and was Editor-in-Chief of the journal, Mathematical Programming. He served as the associate chair of the Engineering-Economic Systems & Operations Research Department (EES & OR) after the merger of the two departments. In 2000, EES & OR merged again, this time with the Industrial Engineering & Engineering Management Department to form Management Science and Engineering (MS&E;). During his sabbatical year at Harvard and MIT (1970-1971), he wrote ‚ÄúManifestations of the Schur Complement‚Äô‚Äô, one of his most cited papers. In 1974, he started working on ‚ÄúThe Linear Complementarity Problem,‚Äù one his most noted publications. In the mid 1980s, two of his former students, Jong-Shi Pang and Richard E. Stone, joined him as co-authors of this book which was published in 1992. ‚ÄúThe Linear Complementarity Problem‚Äù won the Frederick W. Lanchester Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) in 1994. ‚ÄúThe Linear Complementarity Problem‚Äù was republished by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics in the series ‚ÄúClassics in Applied Mathematics series‚Äù in 2009. During 1978-1979, he spent a sabbatical year at the University of Bonn and the University of Cologne. There he wrote the paper ‚ÄúObservations on a Class of Nasty Linear Complementarity Problems‚Äô‚Äô which relates the celebrated Klee-Minty result on the exponential time behavior of the simplex method of linear programming with the same sort of behavior in Lemke's algorithm for the LCP and hamiltonian paths on the n-cube with the binary Gray code representation of the integers from 0 to 2^n - 1. Also during this time he solved the problem of minimally triangulating the n-cube for n = 4 and worked with Mark Broadie to solve a restricted case for n = 5. In 2006 he was appointed a fellow of INFORMS and in 2018 received the Saul I. Gass Expository Writing Award.  Contributions  = Linear complementarity Problem = Cottle is best known for his extensive publications on the Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP). This work includes analytical studies, algorithms, and the interaction of matrix theory and linear inequality theory with the LCP. Much of this is an outgrowth of his doctoral dissertation supervised by George Dantzig, with whom he collaborated in some of his earliest papers. The leading example is \\"Complementary pivot theory of mathematical programming,\\" published in 1968.  Definitions  The standard form of the LCP is a mapping: f: R^n rightarrow R^n textvisiblespace f(x)=q +Mx (1) Given f, find a vector xin R^n , such that x_igeq 0, f_i(x)geq 0 and x_if_i(x) = 0, for i=1,2,...,n Because the affine mapping f is specified by vector and matrix, the problem is ordinarily denoted LCP(q, M) or sometimes just (q, M). A system of the form (1) in which f is not affine is called a nonlinear complementarity problem and is denoted NCP(f). The notation CP(f) is meant to cover both cases.\\" = Polyhedral sets having a least element = According to a paper by Cottle and Veinott: \\"For a fixed m times n matrix A, we consider the family of polyhedral sets X_b = {xAx geq b}, textvisiblespace b in R_m , and prove a theorem characterizing, in terms of A, the circumstances under which every nonempty X_b has a least element. In the special case where A contains all the rows of an n times n identity matrix, the conditions are equivalent to A^T being Leontief.

Released on February 23, 2018, the album has received praise from many reviewers. Background The \\"Toby Arrives\\" album title is in reference to the Hammond organ player Toby Lee Marshall. Dylan Koch insisted that Greg Koch play with Marshall. Greg Koch says his son Dylan Koch insisted he meet Toby Lee Marshall. The three musicians got together to play at a local studio. From that first day the first song on the Toby Arrives cd was written. Greg Koch said. The three musicians first met at a studio that had a B3 organ. During their very first time performing together, Dylan Koch, Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall wrote the title track to Toby Arrives. Release and reception Toby Lee Marshall on September 8, 2018From left, Dylan Koch on drums, Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall September 8, 2018 The album Toby Arrives is entirely instrumental. Greg Koch and Toby Lee Marshall have each spent the majority of their careers playing instrumental songs. The Koch Marshall Trio's debut album Toby Arrives contains songs that, \\"morph into an amazing new relationship with organ influenced Blues Rock.\\" The first studio album by the Koch Marshall Trio has received high praise. Pendragon's review of the album borders on hyperbole: \\"‚ÄòToby Arrives‚Äô is the sort of album you could stack alongside a Thelonious Monk record, a Jeff Beck record or a Mike Landau record. If you went for one of the other three and got this by mistake your day wouldn‚Äôt be ruined.\\" Scope Magazine's R.M. Engleman had this to say about the Toby Arrives album: \\"...the first few songs start off a bit slow, but then the talent kicks in. The three piece organ driven blues release lets you hear a lot of classic and untraditional riffs, both on the keys and guitar. Greg‚Äôs playing is a little jazzy, a little funky, and the riffs are untraditionally cool. Believe me, he doesn‚Äôt just play scale riffs. A lot of little nuances here with both the B3 and guitar.

It provided weekly sailings between Glasgow and Liverpool. The company was formed out of Messrs. Middleton and Pollexfen a trading partnership based in Sligo. The company was one of the last three independent cross channel Irish shipping companies still operational in the 1930s. In 1936 Coast Lines Ltd bought Sligo Steamship Navigation Company. Company history The company offices were based in Wine street in the town. Vessels operated by the company included the SS Killarney (1857), the SS Glasgow (1867), the SS Sligo(1889), SS Liverpool, SS Sligo (1913), SS Carrickfergus, the SS Sligo (1930) and SS Tartar (1899). The SS Sligo (1889) was wrecked in Sligo bay during a storm in 1912. The SS Liverpool, the biggest vessel operated by the company, was built by Messrs John Jones & Sons and was 686 gross tons. She was designed by the naval architect Henry H West. She was designed to sit below the harbour wall level in Sligo. The live animal export trade dominated in the later years of the company. The SS Sligo (1930) was launched on 30 July of that year from the slipways of the Alexandra basin in Dublin port. She had pens for 275 head of cattle and 500 sheep could be accommodated on deck. She also had refrigerated holds for dairy produce. Sinking of the SS Liverpool The steamship SS Liverpool was lost off the south coast of the Isle of Man on 16 December 1916, after hitting a mine laid by a German submarine. The mine had been laid the previous day by U-80 commanded by the 34 year old Kapit√§nleutnant Alfred von Glasenapp. There were sixteen crewmen of which two were killed. The sole passenger on board also died. The men lost were Daniel Garvey, aged 44, from Finisklin, Sligo, a winchman or \\"donkey engine man\\" and was presumed drowned, James Costello, age 31, from Riverside, Sligo, a fireman killed by the explosion. Both men left a wife and children. J P Gillen, from Rosses Point, was the only passenger, returning home for the Christmas holidays who drowned.https://shipwreckedmariners.org.uk/awareness- days/another-1916-centenary-barbarous-outrage-sea/ As of December 1996 the wreck has been identified by divers from the Isle of Man. The company became embroiled in the 1913 Sligo Dock strike. In 1922 the SS Tartar was commandeered by the Free State government for operations in the north Sligo area against anti-treaty forces.

Biography  Nekrasov studied at the Orthodox theological seminary and from 1874 at the University of Moscow. There he was a pupil of the mathematician Nikolai Vasilievich Bugaev. Several years after his graduation, he became a Privatdozent there in 1885 (having received his Russian PhD in the same year, corresponding to a habilitation in the West) and, in 1885 or 1886, an associate professor at Moscow University (where he had been since 1883). In 1890 he received a full professorship. In 1893 he became rector. After his term as rector, he actually wanted to retire, but was not allowed to. He also taught 1885‚Äì1891 Probability Theory and Higher Mathematics at the Moscow Institute of Land Surveying. From 1898 he was almost only with administrative duties for the Ministry of Education (he was curator of the University and responsible for the schools in Moscow and the surrounding area) and moved in 1905 to Saint Petersburg as a member of the Council of the Ministry of Education. After the Russian Revolution, he tried to adapt to the new rulers, dealt with mathematical economics (which he held lectures in 1918‚Äì19) and studied Marxism. He died of pneumonia in 1924. However, his rapprochement with Marxism earned him no recognition. On the contrary, with some of his writings, after his death he was a major target of attacks against religiously influenced mathematicians, culminating in the arrest of Dmitri Egorov and the Luzin Affair.Eugene Seneta: Mathematics, religion, and Marxism in the Soviet Union in the 1930s, Historia Mathematica, Band 31, 2004, 337‚Äì367. In 1891 he was vice-president of the Moscow Mathematical Society and was its president from 1903 to 1905. From 1891 to 1894 he was vice-president of the Society of Friends of Science in Moscow. He dealt with algebra, analysis, mechanics and probability theory. In the latter area he made substantial contributions, which were criticized in his time by Andrey Markov and Aleksandr Lyapunov, because he could not present them in a satisfactory form, and even later he was forgotten. Markov and Lyapunov are today usually called as representatives of the St. Petersburg School (founded by Pafnuty Chebyshev) when it comes to the question of the first mathematically strict treatment of the Central Limit Theorem, the discussion and debate with Nekrasov played a significant role (especially one essay from 1898).

Education Zechmeister earned her BA from Loyola University Chicago in 1994, her M.A. in Latin American Studies from University of Chicago in 1996, and her Ph.D. from Duke University in 2003. Career Zechmeister held her first position as an Assistant Professor at University of California, Davis in 2003 before joining the faculty at Vanderbilt University in the Department of Political Science in 2008. She became Cornelius Vanderbilt Professor of Political Science in 2018. Zechmeister is director of the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP). As Director, she oversees the AmericasBarometer, a comparative public opinion survey that covers 34 nations including all of North, Central, and South America and many Caribbean nations. The survey typically includes more than 40,000 interviews, and is the most expansive regional survey project in the Western Hemisphere. Zechmeister is also a co-founder of the South-east Latin American Behavior Consortium (SELAB). Her research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Open Society Foundations, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Inter-American Development Bank, among others. In 2012, she received the Vanderbilt A&S; Jeffrey Nordhaus Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching and in 2015 she received the Vanderbilt Award for Excellence in Graduate Teaching. Zechmeister is Associate Editor of the Journal of Experimental Political Science and an editorial board member of the following journals: Comparative Political Studies, The Journal of Politics, and Political Behavior.  Research  Much of Zechmeister's research focuses on voting behavior in Latin America, the emergence of political parties, and the volatility of party systems in the region. On these topics, she co-authored (with Herbert Kitschelt, Kirk Hawkins, Juan Pablo Luna, and Guillermo Rosas) the book Latin American Party Systems (Cambridge University Press, 2010). With Ryan Carlin and Matthew Singer, she also co- edited The Latin American Voter: Pursuing Representation and Accountability in Challenging Contexts (University of Michigan Press, 2015), which examines similar themes of political behavior and electoral volatility in Latin America. Zechmeister's early work questions how voters in new Latin American democracies understood ideological labels, for example in her dissertation ‚ÄúSheep or Shepherds? Voter Behavior in New Democratic Contexts‚Äù. She finds that meanings of \\"left‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù over the initial years of Mexican democracy contained references to valence issues and political actors that varied by individuals‚Äô partisanships and political sophistication. ‚ÄúLeft‚Äù labels grew ever more associated with the Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Democr√°tica and its interventionist social welfare message, while ‚Äúright‚Äù labels tended to be defined by the Partido Acci√≥n Nacional (PAN) and its neoliberal and socially conservative message. In related work, she demonstrates that the Partido Revoluncionario Institucional‚Äôs (PRI) decades-long hegemony made location for other parties in the left-right ideological space challenging. A second study in this vein \\"What's Left and Who's Right?\\" compared the usage of ideological labels in Mexico and Argentina. This study largely confirmed her previous findings from Mexico in the Argentine case, and making the point that left-right label meanings vary by context depending on how elites discourse colors such labels. Subsequent solo scholarship (e.g., the chapter \\"Left-Right Identifications and the Latin American Voter\\" in The Latin American Voter) and co-authored work with Margarita Corral developed these themes more deeply with the use of region-wide survey data. The most novel methodological contribution across many of these works is that they employ Q methodology, an inductive approach to the study of human subjectivity developed in cognitive psychology, her work being one of the few applications of Q methodology in Political Science. In recent years, Zechmeister has examined public opinion in the wake of natural disasters. Building off surveys conducted following the Chilean and Haitian earthquakes in 2010, Zechmeister explores in a set of papers the effect material damage and loss has on democratic attitudes and interpersonal trust. In a paper coauthored with Ryan Carlin and Gregory Love, she shows disaster victims in Chile often become less tolerant and supportive of democracy while also becoming more civically engaged. In a second paper with Carlin and Love, Zechmeister finds that, contrary to much of the existing scholarship, disaster loss can reduce social capital, but only in low state- capacity environments. Zechmeister has also contributed to terrorism studies. In her book Democracy at Risk: How Terrorist Threats Affect the Public (University of Chicago Press, 2009), co-authored with Jennifer Merolla, she examines how threats of terrorism affect public opinion. Using survey data from the United States and Mexico, Zechmeister and Merolla argue that terrorist threat leads to increased citizen support for domestic political leaders, making them appear more charismatic than they otherwise would, and leads to increased public support for restrictive domestic laws.

It represented at least 60 Students‚Äô Unions, and 980,000 students, across the UK.  Background  FFS was launched at the National Union of Students' National Conference in 2018. Incumbent Deputy President Amatey Doku called for 'nationwide student-led mobilization to demand a people's vote' during his re-election speech, and delegates passed policy to 'campaign for a second referendum on the deal negotiated'. In May 2018, the campaign launched its statement of intent in an open letter undersigned by 120 student leaders. The letter was featured in several British newspapers, and FFS spokespeople pledged a 'summer of action' involving demonstrations across the UK. The campaign's style has been described as 'irreverent' and 'provocative', attracting a broad youth appeal through memes, videos and profanity.  Activities  The organisation has held a number of direct-action demonstrations, including stunts at the Labour Live festival, outside Boris Johnson's residence, and at Parliament. The group also held numerous rallies and demonstrations across the UK during its 'summer of action', attracting over 160,000 attendees; this culminated with a march at Labour's National Conference. It gained endorsements from Dragons' Den star Deborah Meaden and YouTuber Dodie Clark, as well as several MPs. Members of the campaign have been featured on leading news networks, and in national print media and online. FFS also works closely with Our Future Our Choice (OFOC), another young person's pro-EU advocacy group, collaborating on events like the number of \\"Parliament Takeovers\\" where a large group of young people visit Parliament's central lobby and meet with their local MPs. The primary impact of the group is on the People's Vote campaign itself. Journalist Matthew D'Ancona described the influence of FFS as 'transformative', arguing that 'the public face of People‚Äôs Vote changed fundamentally as the new network fizzed and buzzed and did its work. A campaign that had started life looking like the liberal elite demanding its job back morphed into a grassroots uprising of the young against their elders.'

After several hours, Kak Limah's spirit was captured, but Ustaz Solihin was once again beaten by the spirit. As a result of this commotion, the head of a herd for the elves with his entourage descended into human nature to explain what happened. The spirit was sworn into the original appearance of Nor Aini. Nor Aini is the sister of Eton who falls in love with Khuda. They were married but Khuda had breached the condition by bringing Nor Aini down to human nature without the knowledge of her father. Life in human nature is not as fancy as she lives in the elves. Nor Aini became insane which makes Khuda hide her in the garden. Khuda cheated on his wife and married Kak Limah. This made Nor Aini so angry and revengeful which cause Kak Limah to die. The elf father warned Husin that he was not even able to marry Eton for such a thing to happen. The entourage finally brought back Nor Aini back to the base. The next day, Nor Aini together with her three other friends had broken her father's command and came down to human nature once again to disturb Husin, Wani, Khuda, and Yeh.

The fungus is distinguished by a darkened collar-like ostiole around the ostiolar pore, giving the fungus its name. The fungus is highly variable in shape and form, giving raise to the belief that there are two subclades in the species. The ascospores range from lemon-shaped to nearly spherical with slightly pointed ends. It can grow to be pale green and later turn pale bluish grey or olivaceous with age. The fungus produces the toxic secondary metabolite, chaetochromin. History and taxonomy In 1877, the fungus was originally described by Friedrich Wilhelm Zopf in the Verhandlungen des Botanischen Vereins der Provinz Brandenburg for the Botanischer Verein der Provinz Brandenburg. He described the fungus as part of the genus Chaetomium and initially being named as Chaetomium bostrychodes. C. bostrychodes was originally described to have ellipsoid ascomata by Pier Andrea Saccardo in 1882, but later in 1963, Ames re-examined and described the species to have subglobose to ovoid ascomata instead. The fungus was noted as being unable to produce functional antheridia, which suggested it wasn't part of the heterothallic species of Chaetomium. The fungus was described as unique in the genus Chaetomium for possessing banded spores that are characteristic of no species of Chaetomium described in 1937. The fungus was believed to have two subclades designated C. bostrychodes and C. bostrychodes (A), which were considered to be macroscopically indistinguishable but closely related enough to each other that both subclades were kept as the same species. The two subclades were previously suggested both to be either aberrant physiological or nearly related forms. Using phylogenetic analyses, combined with morphological comparisons to related genera and species, Wang and Samson determined C. bostrychodes to be have morphological diversity specific to indoor Chaetomiaceae that required creating a new genus. The genus, Collariella, was created to include for this diversity, its name refers to the dark collar-like apex that occurs around the ostiolar pore of the ascomata. C. bostrychodes was then transferred to the new genus and renamed Collariella bostrychodes, with the two subclades then grouped together and placed under this name.  Morpthology and phylogeny  Colonies of C. bostrychodes can grow 2.5 to 3.5 mm daily, usually without developing aerial mycelium. It can sometimes grow with pale green exudates and a green or uncoloured reverse. When young, C. bostrychodes appears as colourless and dextrinoid, but upon maturity, turns pale bluish grey or olivaceous with an apical germ pore . C. bostrychodes often are darkened around the 25 to 35 Œºm wide ostiolar pore, giving the genus its name of Collariella. Chaetomium convolutum can have a disposition to develop into some forms of C. bostrychodes, developing narrowly ellipsoidal or narrowly ovoidal perithecia restricted just below the darkened periostiolar collar. Similarly, C. bostrychodes appears similar morphologically to Collariella hilkhuijsenii, but C. bostrychodes can be distinguished via their larger ascospores and thicker terminal ascomatal hairs compared to those of C. hilkhuijsenii. The ascomatal walls are brown or ochraceous and composed of angular 5 to 12 Œºm cells. These tend to fracture underneath the terminal hairs, which then break away as a unit. Brown ascomatal hairs grow mainly from the apical disc, usually appearing as helically coiled in the apical region with little branching. The hairs are either verrucose or warty, which are about 4.5 to 6.5 Œºm thick with occasionally coiled branches. Lateral seta-like hairs are often also present and have tapered or clavate terminal ends with septate. These hairs break away at maturity with no aerial mycelium. C. bostrychodes develops perithecia late and possesses tightly coiled black terminal setae. The terminal hairs are branched, forming one spiral on another. The ascospores are considerably larger on average than those of C. robustum. The asci are often surrounded by paraphyses-like, broad, evanescent filaments with a long, evanescent stalk that is 8 spored and 11 to 14 Œºm wide. The ascomata matures in 10 to 17 days, taking on a silvery appearance when young but then turns dark grey to black when mature. The apically flattened ascomata can be obovate, turbinate, ampulliform or cylindrical with its width ranging from 140 to 250 Œºm wide and ranging from 200 to 400 Œºm high. The fungus is recorded having touter, subglobose or ovoidal, ascomata but it is also recorded having slender, narrowly ellipsoid ascomata with 1 to 2 rows of textura prismatica. The breakdown of asci begins within the perithecia, and ascospores are later ejected in a slime consisting of the freed ascospores. The filaments grow upward and inward to exert pressure against each other to create a central cavity which asci push their way up. The asci deliquesce and then oozes out of the perithecial neck and are not violently discharged. C. bostrychodes fruits in the spring and early summer. The two subclades are divided by phylogenetic and morphological evidence, but high statistical support was found to suggest they share a recent common ancestor and are closely related. The two subclades differ in setae, variability in length and color of terminal hairs, variety in ascospores' shape, with extreme variability between the two in the species. C. bostrychodes can vary in shape, such as possessing mostly ellipsoidal or broadly ellipsoid perithecia. However, both subclades have a specific banding of the spores that appears which is characteristic of C. bostrychodes only. There are differences on what the two subclades will reproduce on, with C. bostrychodes (A) being able to reproduce on asparagin and alcohol-glucose cultures, whereas C. bostrychodes can reproduce on blood fibrin, starch, phenol red, eosin methylene blue, and dextrine-FeClh instead. In C. bostrychodes (A), anastomoses of the terminal hairs are common, but not found in C. bostrychodes. Habitat and ecology C. bostrychodes is considered a lignin, lignocellose, and carbohydrate decomposer but shows a significant preference for lignin, with a high frequency of occurrence in the fermentation layers of the forest. It can be isolated from soil, dung, decaying stems, roots, and seeds, but very rarely in woody materials. It has been isolated and found to be saprobic both in and on dung or excretions of dung of Oryctolagus cuniculu. C. bostrychodes is not limited to forest ecosystems. While not a marine fungi, it has been isolated in the ocean and sediments in the marine muds, which suggests that the fungus can be wind-carried. C. bostrychodes has been rarely isolated from food products, but it has been isolated in contaminated oat grains, okra, pea seeds and pepper. When C. bostrychodes is found in food products, it is typically a result of simple contamination.  Health significance  A toxic pigment, chaetochromin, has now been proven to be widely associated with Chaetomium fungi., including C. bostrychodes. Oral and intraperitoneal administration of chaetochromin to mice may result in pronounced toxicity, which can lead to potential detrimental effects like selective inhibition of haematopoiesis. C. bostrychodes has been isolated from industrially polluted soils of the Kola Peninsula in ecosystems, specifically in ground cover and in areas of pine forests that have associations of moss shrubs and lichens shrubs, it believed to potentially cause diseases like Onychomycosis, skin infections, and peritonitis. However, such cases are rare and therefore not well studied.

She grew up in South Florida, and always loved nature. She graduated from Coral Gables Senior High School in 1960. She has contributed to the field of ecology through her work with and research of tropical ecosystems. Earlier in her career, she spent significant time in the field in tropical locations such as Costa Rica and Panama, as well as in temperate locations in Louisiana. and later on in her career she worked more in the office and classroom, but still spent the occasional day in the field. She has focused on research involving the ecology of exotic invasive plant species, and on ecosystem reactions and recovery following disturbances. Denslow is also a strong supporter of gender equality in the natural sciences, pushing for equal representation of women involved in tropical research and leadership during a 2007 Gender Committee Meeting within the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ATBC). Her most notable contribution to tropical research is her paper \\"Gap Partitioning among Tropical Rainforest Trees\\", published in 1980.  Early life and education  = Influences in early life = Denslow was influenced by the natural world from an early age. Growing up in South Florida, her family spent plenty of time outdoors. She grew up fishing and swimming with her parents and her cousins in the Everglades and the Florida Keys. Throughout her high school and college years, she assisted graduate students at the Virginia UM Marine Laboratory. While Denslow was studying at Oberlin College, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, bringing to light the negative impacts that humans can have on the environment. She grew up knowing that she wanted to have a career focused on nature and conservation, but it was a pivotal experience during a 2-month field course on the fundamentals of tropical ecology in Costa Rica with the Organization for Tropical Studies that she found her passion for tropical ecosystems, and felt she could positively impact this field. = Education = 1964 A.B.

Publications  = Papers =  Gap Partitioning among Tropical Rainforest Trees Her long career as a scientist and educator allowed her to publish many papers, with the journal Biotropica containing 11 of her works. These 11 papers alone have been cited widely by other researchers, with over 700 citations in other papers. Her paper \\"Gap Partitioning among Tropical Rainforest Trees\\" alone accounts for a large percentage of these, and had been cited over 450 times as of 2016‚Äîmaking it the most cited paper in Biotropica's history. However, her paper on gap partitioning among tropical rainforest trees is her most notable contribution to the field of tropical ecology. It was published in 1980 in the journal Biotropica. This study focused on the gaps created in tropical rainforests when trees fall, and sought to answer how so many different species of trees can have reproductive success within these gaps. Denslow considered that depending on the severity of the tree fall, the gaps would be made larger or smaller. She suggested that rainforest trees adapted strategies to improve reproductive success by evolving specific traits that increase the rate of seedling success and recruitment in tree fall gaps of certain size ranges‚Äîsome species may exploit smaller gaps, while others may exploit larger gaps. The size of the gaps affects many other factors in seedling success, such as the amount of light, humidity, and temperature. This 'partitioning' of the tree fall clearings encourages diversity and coexistence of rainforest tree species, because each species is best adapted to a specific microclimate.

The battle was fought near the town of Strehla in Saxony, Germany.  Background  In August 1760, Fredrick the Great of Prussia and his army made ready to repel further Austrian incursions into Prussian territory. When the Austrian offensive did come, it came in Prussian-occupied Silesia. However, a second Austrian army of 25,000 men also began advancing upon Frederick's holdings in Eastern Saxony, putting the Prussians in danger of being caught in a large pincer movement.Duffy Ch., By the Force of Arms, Vol. II of \\"The Austrian Army in the Seven Years War\\", The Emperor Press, Chicago 2008. To counter this threat, Frederick dispatched Lt. General Johann Dietrich von H√ºlsen and 12,000 men to hold the west bank of the Elbe river at the town of Strehla while Frederick dealt with the Austrians in Silesia.Frederick II, Oeuvres de Frederic le Grand, vol. V, Berlin 1847.Der Siebenj√§hrige Krieg, hrsg Grossen Generalstab, Band 13 - Torgau, Berlin 1914. Five days before the engagement at Strehla, Frederick and his army defeated the Austrian forces in Silesia at the Battle of Liegnitz, effectively rendering the Austrian plan to pincer the Prussian forces defunct. H√ºlsen and his army arrived in Strehla, and began to fortify their position. Rather than risk a fording of the Elbe at Strehla, the Austrian commander (Frederick Michael Zweibr√ºcken) instead chose to cross the river at a different point and then march parallel to the Elbe until he encountered H√ºlsen's forces.  Battle  The Prussian army dug in on the high ground around Strehla's suburbs and behind a wood to the west of town. The Austrians arrived from the south, with Zweibr√ºcken splitting his larger army in order to attack the Prussian lines from multiple directions. Despite being aware of this flanking maneuver, H√ºlsen resolved to fight a battle centered around a static defensive line. The battle began at 5:00 A.M. with an exchange of fire between the Austrian and Prussian artillery. Soon after, several Prussian battalions broke through the woods near Strehla, forcing a much larger body of Austrian infantry to redeploy to counter them. Meanwhile, the main lines of Prussian and Austrian infantry engaged each other on a field to the immediate south of the town. After two hours of fighting, the Prussians counterattacked and began to push the Austrians back to the south. In the meantime, the Prussian cavalry succeeded in driving back their Austrian counterparts on the Prussian far right flank; rather than purse the retreating Austrian cavalry, the Prussian horse reformed, charged, and overran several isolated Austrian infantry battalions. Emboldened by this success, the Prussian infantry in the woods advanced and succeeded in driving back more of the Austrian infantry.Dorn G., Engelmann J., Die Kavallerie ‚ÄìRegimenter Friederich des Grossen 1756-1763, Friedberg 1984. With both flanks of his army being forced back, Zweibr√ºcken order a withdraw, and the fighting was concluded by 7:00 A.M. The Prussian army remained in the field until 1:00 P.M., waiting for a second Austrian attack. When one did not materialize, H√ºlsen withdrew his army from Strehla and marched to Torgau. The Austrian army returned the next day and occupied the former Prussian position at Strehla. H√ºlsen was personally thanked by Frederick for his delaying and successful repulsing of the Austrians.Kurd von Sch√∂ning: Der Siebenj√§hrige Krieg.

Arrival in Australia Her Australian registration papers say Lucy Ann was a brig of 213 tons built at Frederickton, New Brunswick, Canada, in 1817 or 1819.Ronald Parsons, Ships of Australia and New Zealand, Part Two, K-Z, McGill, South Australia, 1983, p.10 Another source, based on Canadian records, agree the vessel was built at Frederickston, but in 1810, and was initially called the William (236 tons). Yet another source says she was built at St Johns in 1809.Lloyd‚Äôs Register, 1826 What seems beyond dispute is that her length was 87 feet 3 inches, beam 23 feet 10 inches, with 5 feet 3 inches between decks.Parsons, p.10. Lucy Ann departed London 19 January 1827 under the command of Captain Ranulph Dacre with a general cargo and a few passengers. After calls at Cork and St Jago the vessel arrived Hobart on 22 May.Colonial Times and Tasmanian Advertiser, 25 May 1827, p.2. She departed Hobart and arrived Sydney 26 June.Ian Hawkins Nicholson, Shipping arrivals and departures, Sydney, 1826 to 1840, Roebuck, Canberra, 1981, p.22. After completing several voyages between Sydney and Hobart, Captain Dacre offered the vessel for sale to the New South Wales colonial government in August 1827.The Monitor, 30 August 1827, p.3 The offer was accepted, the government paying ¬£2,200.Parsons, p.10. In government service Lucy Ann departed Sydney 23 October 1827 for Western Port, on the coast of Victoria, where the government was attempting to establish a new settlement near present-day Corinella. Aboard were 22 soldiers for the garrison, plus other settlers.Nicholson, p.26. The settlement was poorly located and later had to be abandoned. On 12 February 1828 she was despatched from Sydney to Moreton Bay where the government was in the process of creating a new settlement that would eventually become the city of Brisbane.Nicholson, p.28. In November 1828, Lucy Ann departed Sydney for King George's Sound in Western Australia, and Fort Dundas on Melville Island off the northern coast, where two new government settlements were being established.Nicholson, p.37. The settlement at Melville Island was beset by problems and had to be abandoned. The colony at King George's Sound, the first in Western Australia, prospered and later became the modern city of Albany. Lucy Ann departed Sydney, on 26 December 1830, in company with HMS Comet, to take aboard the inhabitants of Pitcairn Island and transfer them to Tahiti.Nicholson, p.57. Pitcairn, it was decided, had become too small and crowded for the descendants of the Bounty mutineers and the British government had obtained permission from the Tahitian leadership for their resettlement on Tahiti. A dozen of the 86 islanders died in Tahiti due to their susceptibility to disease. For that reason, and, being homesick, they were returned to Pitcairn five months later.H.E. Maude, Of Islands & Men; studies in Pacific history, Oxford University Press, London, 1968, pp.284-314. Lucy Ann was back in Sydney by June 1831 where it was announced she would soon be offered for sale. In September that year she was sold out of government service. Her new owners, who paid ¬£1,200, were the Weller brothers, who were in the process of establishing a trading post and bay whaling station in New Zealand.Parsons, p.10. Whaling and trading Port Otago in the 1840s Lucy Ann, under the command of Captain William Owen, left Sydney and arrived at Otago in October with stores and merchandise. This included 6 cases of muskets, 10 barrels and 104 half barrels of gunpowder and assorted whaling equipment.Ian N. Church, Opening the manifest on Otago's infant years; shipping arrivals and departures, Otago harbour and coast 1770-1860, Otago Heritage Books, Dunedin, 2001, p.24. This whaling/trading community became one of the first European settlements in the area. Lucy Ann then went on to the North Island, for a cargo of timber, before returning to Sydney 29 February 1832, in need of repair.Church, p.24. While in Sydney Harbour someone tried to burn the vessel. George Weller offered a reward of ¬£50 for apprehension of the culprit.Robert McNab, The old whaling days; a history of southern New Zealand from 1830 to 1840, Golden Press, Auckland, 1913 (reprinted 1975) p.98. She departed again for New Zealand in May 1832 with general merchandise, returning early in October with more timber.Nicholson, p.81 & 89. She left for New Zealand again in mid November, returning in April 1833 with spars and flax.Nicholson, p.89 & 96. She was by now a regular trader on the trans-Tasman route. She left again for New Zealand in May with a whaling gang, 160 tons of empty oil casks and provisions, returning in November with 130 tuns of right whale oil, flax and 5 Maori passengers.Nicholson, p.104. This was reported to be the first oil brought from Otago. December saw her on the route again, returning 26 April 1834.Nicholson, p.111. She departed for New Zealand again in May, under Captain Anglin, and returned from Otago in August with whale oil.Nicholson, p.115. She departed in January 1835 on the New Zealand run and was back by mid May with more oil.Nicholson, p.129. The following month she left again for the Weller brothers for NZ, this time under the command of Captain Samuel Rapsey, and returned in October with oil.Nicholson, p.137. =Deep-sea whaling= The Bay of Islands c.1840 Late in 1835 the Weller brothers decided to send the vessel sperm whaling. Lucy Ann was modified for pelagic whaling and departed Sydney under the command of Captain Thomas Richards in mid December 1835.Nicholson, p.137. The vessel cruised off New Zealand and called several times at the Bay of Islands for food, wood and water. She returned to Sydney on 13 April 1837 with 75 tuns of sperm whale oil.Nicholson, p.166. Her second dedicated whaling voyage, again under Captain Richards, began in mid June 1837 and ended 11 months later when she returned to Sydney having taken 500 barrels of right whale oil and 300 of sperm whale oil.Nicholson, p.190. It seems the \\"black\\" oil was landed at Otago in October 1837, for transhipment to Sydney, after which she went sperm whaling.Sydney Herald, 9 November 1837, p.3. Her third voyage began 8 July 1838 under a new master, Captain Charles Aldrich. The voyage lasted 15 months during which time she was reported among the Solomon Islands and at Tahiti. She visited Lord Howe Island in September just before returning to Port Jackson on 13 October 1839 with a reported 800 barrels of sperm whale oil.Nicholson, p.226. Under Captain Aldrich, she next made a brief three-month voyage, departing 24 November, to New Zealand to collect oil from the Weller brother's whaling establishment at Otago. She returned 10 February 1840 with 700 barrels worth of right whale oil and a 22-man whaling gang and other passengers.Nicholson, p.234. Her fourth pelagic whaling voyage began, under Captain Aldrich, in mid May 1840. She was reported off Woodlark Island late that year and at Port Stephens, in August 1841, in a very leaky state. She returned to Port Jackson 11 August with just 260 barrels of sperm whale oil.Graeme Broxam & Ian Nicholson (1988), Shipping arrivals and departures, Sydney, 1841 to 1844, and Gazetteer, Canberra, Roebuck, p.45. Back in Sydney the vessel received considerable repairs and was put up for sale. Her new owners sent her on another whaling voyage, under the command of Henry Ventom. Lucy Ann departed Sydney 14 February 1842, equipped with four whaleboats, and with a crew of about 30 men. She was at Lord Howe Island late in February and was reported on the equator by late June. On 7 July 1842 she arrived at Santa Christina in the Marquesas Islands for fresh provisions, wood and water.Ida Leeson, ‚ÄúThe mutiny on the Lucy Ann,‚Äù Philological Quarterly, Vol XIX, No4, October 1940, p.370. While here nine crewmen deserted and another eight were put in irons for ‚Äúmutinous conduct.‚Äù By 8 August the vessel was at Nuku Hiva in the Marquesas where a more crewmen deserted. A few replacements were found on the island, one of them an American seaman, Herman Melville. Melville would later describe the vessel in his book Omoo as, Herman Melville in 1846 or 1847. The first edition of Omoo by Herman Melville was published in 1847 Native houses on Tahiti in 1842. The vessel called at Tahiti in September 1842 where eleven crewmen, including Melville, were put ashore for refusing to obey orders.Mark Howard, \\"Melville and the Lucy Ann mutiny,\\" Leviathan, 13 (2) June 2011, p.12. Lucy Ann returned to Sydney on 20 May 1843 with just 250 barrels of sperm whale oil.Broxham & Nicholson, p.189. Lucy Ann departed on her next voyage 25 June 1843 under the command of Captain Richard Lee.Broxham & Nicholson, p.189. She touched at Norfolk Island in February 1843 and was reported off Lord Howe Island in March. She was at Port Stephens on the coast of New South Wales in May and in August at Port Cooper (Lyttelton) New Zealand. She returned to Sydney 26 September 1844 with 614 barrels of oil.Broxham & Nicholson, p.301. The vessel was purchased in January 1845 by high-profile entrepreneur Benjamin Boyd who again sent her whaling.Parsons, p.10, & Broxham & Nicholson, p.301. Her commander on this voyage was Captain John Long (c1815-1852) and carried a crew of 30 men. She returned 10 months later with 700 barrels of oil.Sydney Morning Herald (SMH), 5 January 1846, p.2. It was reported in the press, \\"The Lucy Ann has returned to port, owing to the badness of her whaling gear, as no dependance could be placed in either harpoons, lances or spades.\\"SMH, 4 April 1845, p.2. Two boats on a beach in the Solomon Islands in the 1840s. Her next voyage was under Captain William Barr and was planned to last for two years. They departed Sydney 15 June 1846 and by 23 June were off Booby Shoal in the Coral Sea where they saw the wreck of the Peruvian (304 tons) which had left Sydney 26 February bound for Lima. Early in February 1847 Lucy Ann called at Stewart's Island (Sikaiana) in the Solomon Islands for water and wood. The ship then cruised off New Britain and New Ireland. Captain Barr went aboard the Sydney whaler Terror (Captain Downes) also owned by Benjamin Boyd, and Captain Barr told him of his crew troubles. Many of his crewmen were \\"twice-convicted convicts\\" and reported he had discovered and thwarted a plot by some of them to take control of the ship while the boats were away after whales. Captain Downes recorded Captain Barr bored him with his endless whaling stories.The Terror log, Australian National Maritime Museum. Lucy Ann returned to Sydney 28 June, twelve months early, largely due to crew problems and complaints about the food.SMH, 29 June 1847, p.2. The next whaling voyage began 7 September 1847 under the command of Captain William Henry Downes.Sydney Mail, 8 July 1847, 2 The vessel was off Wilson‚Äôs Promontory on the coast of Victoria in October when Captain Downes boat upset while taking a whale and he was drowned. His body was placed in a cask or rum till return to Sydney for burial. Chief officer William Bearis then took command. The vessel cruised off the Kermadec Islands and was reported at Aneityum and Lord Howe Island before returning to Sydney 29 January 1849 with 300 barrels of sperm whale oil.SMH, 30 January 1849, p.2 While at sea the vessel had been sold to William Campbell. Her next whaling voyage, under the command of Captain William Greig, began on 19 June 1849. By June she was at Rotuma where more crewmen were recruited. She was anchored at Strong's Island on 23 May 1850 when a water cask fell down the main hatch and struck the 2nd mate, Mr Davis. He suffered a fractured skill and died a few hours later and was buried on the island the following day. After 17 months away the vessel returned to Sydney with just 100 barrels of sperm whale oil, 3 tuns of coconut oil and a case of tortoiseshell.The Shipping Gazette and Sydney General Trade List, 16 November 1850, p.302 The last whaling voyage began 24 March 1851, under the command of Captain James Lovett. She returned to port just a week later having experiencing a series of gales after which ‚Äúthe crew refused to proceed on the voyage.‚ÄùSMH, 1 April 1851, p.2 Replacement crewmen were found and the vessel resumed the cruise on 4 April. By 7 June, Lucy Ann was reported at Samoa where additional crewmen seem to have been recruited. By mid September they were off Nauru and then New Ireland in October. They dropped anchor at Gower‚Äôs Harbour on New Ireland on 2 November 1851, where they encountered the schooner Ariel. They told Captain Bradley of that vessel that they had earlier had some kind of violent clash with the natives of New Guinea. Captain Bradley described Lucy Ann as being \\"well armed and well manned\\".Joseph Bradley, A nine month cruise of the \\"Ariel\\" schooner from San Francisco in company with the \\"Wanderer of the Royal Yacht Squadron, belonging to Benjamin Boyd, Esq., c1860, re-issued and annotated by Mervyn D. Cob croft, 1991, Brisbane, Australia) p.81. The vessel experienced a succession of gales prior to her return to Sydney where she arrived on 23 March 1852 with 300 barrels of sperm whale oil and a crew of 25 men.SMH, 24 April 1852, p.110 =Last years= Lucy Ann departed Sydney on 25 May 1852 for Melbourne and arrived 11 June.Empire, 26 May 1852, p.2. While in Melbourne she was offered for sale in Melbourne as a store ship.Argus 26 June 1852, p.1 The discovery of rich gold fields in central Victoria the year before had led to the arrival of large numbers of vessels to land cargo and passengers and created an urgent need for storage facilities in Port Phillip Bay. She was bought for use as coal depot by the owners of the steamer Gipsy. In March 1855 she was offered for sale, as a storge hulk, as part of the estate of George A. Mouritz and changed hands again, this time for ¬£85.Argus, 27 March 1855, p.4 It is unknown when and where she was finally broken up or sank.

Although mainly known as a significant plant pathogen, it also contributes to various respiratory allergic conditions such as asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis. Despite the presence of mating genes, no sexual reproductive stage has been reported for this fungus. In terms of geography, it is most likely to be found in tropical and sub-tropical regions, but also in places with high rain and humidity such as Poland. It has also been found in Taiwan and Israel. Its main mode of propagation is vegetative. The resulting conidia reside in the soil, air and water. These spores are extremely resilient and can overwinter on crop debris and overwintering herbaceous plants.  Growth and morphology The conidia of A. brassicicola are abundant in the outdoor environment from the months of May to late October in the northern hemisphere, peaking in June and again in October. The conidia are dark brown and smooth-walled, up to 60 x 14¬µm. The conidia are cylindrical to oblong in shape and are muriform and produced in chains of 8-10 spores. They are firmly attached to conidiophores that are olive-brown, septate, and growing to an upper range of 100-200 ¬µm, although this overall length may vary. Conidia are borne in continuous, chain- like structure, but branching at the base has also been observed. Although conidia can be spread by rain, the most common means of spread is through the air. The fungus grows on epidermal leaf wax of plants, particularly those in the Brassicaceae, and prefers an environment with high humidity and temperature range of . Macroscopically, the mycelium exhibits a range of colour: unpigmented when young, to olive-grey, grey-black at maturity. Colonies of A. brassicicola tend to be dark brown or black in colour. Research history Historically, much of the early research concerning the fungus was based on plant defense mechanisms. However, once its genome was sequenced, efforts shifted to identifying the genes involved in host-parasite interaction. One of the pioneers for genetic research into Alternaria brassicicola was the Lawrence group at Virginia Bioinformatics Institute and the Genome Center at Washington University. The most common media used for A. brassicicola growth are PDA (potato dextrose agar) and V8 juice-agar. In vitro and under optimal conditions, colonies grow rapidly and appear dark green or white-grey. Spontaneous sporulation occurs at 25¬∫C in darkness on PDA medium. =Growth cycle= Colonies of A. brassicicola on Potato Dextrose Agar after 3 d (l) and 7 d (r). Hours after inoculation: *2h: Conidia swells *3h: Germ tube formation observed at the apical or middle cells of conidia *8h: Vesicle of dissolved contents moves from conidial cell to germ tube *20h: Infection of the host cell *48h: Mycelial network develops on the surface *72h: Many chains of conidia can be seen  Pathogenesis and infection  There are three main sources of infection: nearby infected seeds, spores from plant debris in the topsoil and Brassica weeds, and spores moved by wind and air from farther away. Infected leaves can spread their spores up to a diameter of 1800m. There are also three major entry points to the host cell: epidermal penetration, stomatal penetration and penetration through an insect. Contact with the host cell triggers the release of various cell wall degrading enzymes which allow the fungus to attach itself to the plant and begin degradation. The suggested mode of attack is through host-specific toxins, primarily AB toxins, that induce cell death by apoptosis. This results in what look like dents and lesions in the host plant. These are brown, concentric circles with a yellow tinge at the circumference, usually about 0.5-2.5cm in diameter. Necrosis can generally be observed within 48 hours of infection. The spores can reside on the external seed coat of infected seeds, but the mycelium can also penetrate under the seed coat, where it has the ability to remain viable for several years. Occasionally, it can even penetrate the embryo tissue. The primary mode of transmission is through contaminated seed. Also, the infection is not limited to specific areas of the host plant; it can spread all over and even cause damping off of the seedlings at a relatively early stage. It also affects the host species at various developmental stages. As mentioned above, seedlings exhibit dark stem lesions followed by damping off. Velvety, black spots, resembling soot, can be observed on older plants. Pathogenesis is affected by factors such as: temperature, humidity, pH, reactive oxidation species, host defense molecules. =Genes= Out of the 10,688 predicted genes from the A. brassicicola genome, 139 encode small secretion proteins that may be involved in pathogenesis, 76 encode lipases and 249 encode glycosyl hydrolases that are important for polysaccharide digestion, potentially damaging host cells. In contrast, mutations in genes such as AbHog1, AbNPS2, and AbSlt2 affect cell wall integrity and make the fungus more susceptible to host defenses. Currently, research is being done to identify the gene(s) responsible for encoding a transcription factor, Bdtf1, important for the detoxification of host metabolites. =Biochemistry= The most common toxin studied for A. brassicicola is the AB toxin, said to be connected to the virulence, pathogenicity and host range for the fungus. It is most likely produced during conidial germination and probably linked to the ability of the fungus to infect and colonize Brassica leaves However, recent studies have explored new potential metabolites. For example, this fungus also produces histone deacetylase inhibitors, but these do not have a significant impact on lesion size. Some studies show only a 10% reduction in virulence. Furthermore, alternariol and tenuazonic acid seem to affect mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathways and protein synthesis respectively (in the host cell), but again, not to a significant degree. Some cytokines have been linked with the discolouration associated with A. brassicicola infection. Cell wall degrading enzymes like lipases and cutinases are also linked to its pathogenicity, but more evidence of their efficacy is required. One important transcription factor is AbPf2. It regulates 6 of the 139 genes encoding small secretion proteins and may have a role in pathogenesis, specifically cellulose digestion. =Treatments= In order to protect their crops, many individuals pre-treat their seeds with fungicides. The most widespread active ingredients in these fungicides are Iprodione and Strobilurins. In 1995, it was reported that Iprodione most likely acts by mutating two histidine residues in the target site of enzymes. Ultimately, it inhibits germ tube growth. However, the ubiquitous use of fungicides has resulted in the fungus growing increasingly resistant. Thus, different, non-chemical approaches have been explored. People have tried to develop resistant Brassicaceae crops through breeding. However, this has proved challenging due to the difficulty of transferring genes from wild-type to cultivated strains, resulting in genetic bottlenecks. It is further complicated by the probability that resistance seems to be a polygenic trait. There are also some Brassica plants that have developed resistance to the pathogen naturally. High phenolase activity, high leaf sugar, and thicker wax layers reduce water-borne spore germination. It has been shown that the presence of camalexin in the host plant helps it to disrupt pathogen development. For example, an Arabidopsis mutant in the pad-3 gene that does not produce camalexin is more susceptible to infection. Varying levels show differing levels of resistance. Another suggestion put forth is crop debris management. The aim is to minimize exposure of the crop plants to spores present in the soil by using crop rotation and weed control. Biological approaches have also been studied. One approach has been to use antagonistic fungi such as Aureobasidium pullulans & Epicoccum nigrum to subdue the effect of A. brassicicola. The plants C. fenestratum and Piper betle also show potent fungicidal activity towards A. brassicicola both in vitro and under greenhouse conditions. These levels are comparable to Iprodione. The active compound, berberine, affects cell wall integrity and ergosterol biosynthesis. Ethanol extracts from the dried roots of Solanum nigrum (black nightshade), traditionally used as herbal remedies in places ranging from the Far East to India and Mexico, show promising anti-fungal activity as well. They seem to suppress conidial germination, possibly by interfering with the AB toxin.  Economic impact  As mentioned previously, Alternaria brassicicola causes severe black spot diseases in a number of ecologically important crops. Often, it occurs in conjunction with Alternaria brassicae. However, it is the more dominant invasive species. These infections lead to a significant loss in viable seeds and produce. The resulting lesions greatly reduce available photosynthetic area, leading to wilt and plant death. Crops like infected cabbages do not last long during storage or transportation. In some cases, yield reductions can be as high as 20-50%. The lack of ability to use fungicides makes it challenging to sustain organic crops in a cost-effective way.

The team joined the Major Arena Soccer League for the 2018‚Äì19 season. The club featured former Toronto FC players Dwayne De Rosario, Molham Babouli and Adrian Cann on the roster in its first season. Just as the 2019‚Äì20 season began, it was announced the team would cease operations. History =Background= Historically the Canadian professional indoor soccer landscape consisted of Canadian franchises in American leagues particularly in the North American Soccer League (NASL) and the National Professional Soccer League (NPSL). The height of Canadian participation in indoor soccer occurred during the 1980‚Äì81 and 1981‚Äì82 NASL seasons when four Canadian clubs participated simultaneously. The height of Canadian participation in the NPSL would eventually expand to include four teams, which consisted of the Edmonton Drillers, Montreal Impact, Toronto Shooting Stars, and Toronto ThunderHawks. After the demise of the NPSL in 2001 the country was without a professional league structure, until the creation of the Canadian Major Indoor Soccer League (CMISL) in 2007. The league served as the first exclusively Canadian professional indoor soccer league, and was primarily based in Western Canada until it ceased operations in 2012. In 2017, the Canadian Arena Soccer Association (CASA) was founded as the governing body for the sport in Canada. The CASA sanctioned the developmental Youth Arena Premier League and the semi-professional Arena Premier League ‚Äì both based in Mississauga. The purpose of the Arena Premier League was to develop and provide talent to the Canadian national indoor team, and later to the MetroStars. =Formation and dissolution= The MetroStars were founded in 2018 and were one of 17 participants in the 2018‚Äì19 Major Arena Soccer League season. They made their debut on December 1 against the defending league champion Baltimore Blast. According to team owner Gladiator Sports, the MetroStars payroll for the year was about $500,000. The team finished the 2018‚Äì19 season 15th in the league with a record of 4 wins, 20 losses, and ranked 14th in attendance with an average of 1,020 per game. For the 2019‚Äì20 season, the team rebranded as MetroStars Canada. They planned to play their 12 home games in six cities across Ontario (St. Catharines, Kingston, Oshawa, Windsor, Sarnia, and Brampton) to spread awareness for the sport. Before playing a single game that season, the Major Arena Soccer League published a revised schedule that did not include the MetroStars. Six days later, the team confirmed that they would not be participating in the season due to issues coordinating their home matches. 2018‚Äì19 roster =Active players= *As of 24 August 2019 =Inactive players= References External links *Official website Defunct Major Arena Soccer League teams Soccer clubs in Ontario Sport in Mississauga Canadian indoor soccer teams 2018 establishments in Ontario Association football clubs established in 2018 Association football clubs disestablished in 2019 2019 disestablishments in Ontario ","title":"Mississauga MetroStars"},{"id":"58473080","text":"Pomme de Terre Wildlife Management Area, also referred to as Pomme de Terre WMA, is a protected area located in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana owned and managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF).

Although it declared independence in 2008, only a few countries (such as Russia) acknowledge it. The region is inhabited by Ossetians, an Iranian ethnic group. According to Russia, Nicaragua, Venezuela and the microstates of Tuvalu and Nauru, it is one of the world's newest independent states. All other states and international organisations consider South Ossetia an autonomous region of Georgia, functioning as a de facto state for twenty years after declaring independence and conducting a successful armed rebellion. Its Georgian inhabitants have been displaced. South Ossetia has been a source of tension for a number of years, with Georgia and Russia's political differences impeding peaceful independence and breeding a turbulent series of events which undermine the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  History  During the 13th century, the Ossetians are believed to have moved into the regions of North and South Ossetia. They were related to the nomadic Alans; osiderives from Georgian. Alanic tribes in the North Caucasus formed a kingdom knows as Alania during the ninth century, which was bordered by Arabs and the Byzantine Empire. Although the mountains were a natural defence, Alania was destroyed by the Mongols in 1230. The remaining Alans fled further into the Caucasus Mountains and settled in Ossetia, which were part of the Kingdom of Georgia. The political climate deteriorated, opening the door to Russian annexation. =Russian occupation= A peasant uprising began in South Ossetia in 1918, which was forcefully suppressed by a Georgian Menshevik force led by Jaliko Jugheli. A Russian force crossed the border and attacked the Georgian army and guard, provoking further violence. Amid heavy casualties, thousands of Ossetians fled to Soviet Russia. Many villages were burnt, and previously- fertile land was destroyed. The relationship between the Georgians and the Ossetians deteriorated between 1918 and 1920, with the Georgian government accusing the Ossetians of allying with the Bolsheviks. Riots, rebellions and battles killed thousands of people, in addition to deaths from starvation and disease. Menshevik Georgia introduced its constitution in early 1921, with no mention of autonomous districts and related legislation. On 25 February 1921, the Red Army entered Georgia and established Bolshevik rule. =Georgian oblast= The Red Army invasion ended the Democratic Republic of Georgia. North and South Ossetia were incorporated by the Soviet Union as separate regions. North Ossetia was an oblast of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from 1924 to 1936, and became an autonomous republic within the RSFSR in 1936. South Ossetia was an oblast of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. Although Russian and Georgian were official languages, the Ossetians were permitted to use their language (including in schools). Several unsuccessful attempts were made during the 1920s to unify North and South Ossetia, and Georgia's intention to control both regions was rejected. =1990s unrest= The communist South Ossetian authorities declared sovereignty on 20 September 1990 as part of the USSR. Tensions increased, with ethnic Georgians believing that they were being dispossessed. Georgian president Zviad Gamsakhurdia removed South Ossetian autonomy, declaring a state of emergency which intensified South Ossetian demands for unification with North Ossetia. The strained relations bred a rapid increase in nationalist militias. Georgian police entered Tskhinvali (the South Ossetian capital) on 5 January 1991, beginning the 1991‚Äì1992 South Ossetia War. War crimes were committed by both sides; over 250 people were killed, and at least 485 were wounded. Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the 1992 election of Eduard Shevardnadze as president of Georgia encouraged a more harmonious relationship between the ethnic groups. The Dagomys agreements endorsed a joint peacekeeping force in the conflict zone to stabilise and monitor conditions and the Joint Control Commission for Georgian‚ÄìOssetian Conflict Resolution oversaw the region's peacekeeping forces. Russia's role in peacekeeping was solidified by a 1994 agreement. South Ossetia withdrew its resolution to leave Georgia, and a quadruple peacekeeping force (Georgia, Russia, and North and South Ossetia} was in operation. Lyudvig Chibirov was elected as the first president of South Ossetia on November 1996, and further agreements were signed between Georgia and Russia to restore South Ossetia's economy and accommodate returning refugees.  2008 war  In 2008, a number of NATO members (including Georgia) participated in the annual Partnership for Peace Sea Breeze exercise in the Black Sea. Western operations in the area were often followed by Russian ones. One, Caucasian Frontier 2008, was conducted on 5 July. Many interpret this as very suspicious event of what was to occur in the following days. Incidents often took place around the region of South Ossetia, but those of 2008 seemed to be more sinister and vigorous. Rival Provisional Administration of South Ossetia leader Dmitry Sanakoyev had survived a bombing for which the South Ossetian president, Eduard Kokoity's, government was blamed. Russian jets began flying over South Ossetia, and Georgia was complaining about Ossetian alleged shelling of Georgian land and villages by the end of July. Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili outlined the regional hostilities in a letter submitted by Georgia's UN ambassador to the UN Security Council and General Assembly. Saakashvili's letter indicated attacks on Georgian police and peacekeeping posts and persistent, large-scale attacks on civilians and villages. Ossetians reported that villages and residential areas had been targeted on 1 August, with six Ossetians killed and others wounded. According to Tbilisi, Georgian forces were responding to incoming fire. Due to the unrest, Tskhinvali was partially evacuated as a precaution; however, media, journalists and leaders attempted to reassure South Ossetia that there would be no all-out war. Saakashvili's forces began Operation Clean Field. News began to circle about the Georgian shelling of South Ossetia's capital, Tskhinvali with rocket systems, large guns, resulting in numerous casualties in various villages such as Dmenis, Tsunar and Kvernet. Although Russian UN ambassador Vitaly Churkin called for an emergency Security Council meeting, no immediate ceasefire was secured. Georgia reportedly controlled several South Ossetian villages, and fighting continued in Tskhinvali. The command post of the joint peacekeeping force was involved in the hostilities (with casualties), and residents were in basement shelters for up to 16 hours. Russia attacked and occupied Gori, controlling operations in Ossetia, and Saakashvili said that he would recall troops from Iraq. The United Nations Security Council met on 8 August to discuss apparent human- rights violations of human rights, and condemned the Russian bombing as undermining Georgian sovereignty and territorial integrity. The United States ordered Russia to cease its attacks in Georgia and withdraw all forces from Georgian territory.  Human-rights violations  Russia has extended the South Ossetian border into Georgia several times, with the most significant (and recent) case in July 2015 when barbed-wire fences were moved by Russian border guards further into Georgia. This was in defiance of European Union (EU) policy, since the Russian troops impacted ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia and Russia. Border expansion began covertly in 2008, and has continued until the present; cameras have been installed to monitor movement on the border. This evidently affects Georgian shepherds, who are accused of trespassing and frequently fined and arrested while moving their flocks. The South Ossetian minister of foreign affairs has not addressed Russia's border- expansion operations. Russian forces have significant control over South Ossetian territory; the penetration of Russian border guards into Georgian territory undermines human rights and raises national-security concerns about the Baku‚ÄìSupsa Pipeline. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) aims to restrict Russia's role in Transcaucasia, referring to events in South Ossetia as \\"ethnic cleansing and mass expulsion of the Kartvelian (Georgian) people and communities\\".  Progress  After the 2008 war, the EU, OSCE and UN co-chaired the Geneva International Discussions (GID). The talks, involving Georgia, Russia Abkhazia, South Ossetia and the United States, addressed non-violent solutions in the region (despite Russia's heavy military presence) and the return of internally displaced persons. The European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia (EUMM) has been in operation since the end of 2008. The mission monitors the Georgian, Russian and South Ossetian borders daily, documents any troop movements, and engages with the community to assess potential insurgency in the region. South Ossetia has prohibited the EUMM, however, from entering their territory.  References   Related reading   Amnesty International. 2008. Civilians in the Line of Fire: The Georgia-Russia Conflict.

Biography He was born in Caspano, a neighborhood of Civo, in the province of Sondrio, in north Lombardy. He may have journeyed to Rome to study with Carlo Maratta, or more likely was influenced by Maratta's large school of pupils, including Giorgio Bonola, who worked together with Parravicini in painting for the church of Sant'Alessandro in Zebedia in Milan. Between 1687 and 1688, he painted for the choir and chapel of the archbishop's chapel in Caspano. He also painted for the parish church of Chiuro, and churches in Delebio, San Carlo and Traona.La Valtellina:guida turistica, page 259. He painted some of the Quadroni of St. Charles, large canvases depicting episodes of the life of San Carlo Borromeo for the Milan Cathedral. He also painted in Crema and B√¨umo Inferiore (Varese).

Early years LaRoche grew up in Rochester, New York, and she received training in piano and voice at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. By age 10, she was acting on radio programs. She gained additional acting experience in Rochester with the Community Players and the Paddy Hill Players. In 1939, LaRoche was a sectional winner in the Gateway to Hollywood competition. Career Eli Wallach, LaRoche, Cheryl Callaway, and Robert Keith in The Lineup (1958) LaRoche, Arthur O'Connell and Sandra Dee in Gidget (1959) Ann-Margret, LaRoche and Paul Lynde in Bye Bye Birdie (1963) LaRoche began singing and acting on and off Broadway in 1938. Over the next seven years she appeared in a number of Broadway musical comedies, including the 1942 operetta The Merry Widow by Franz Leh√°r. LaRoche performed in various feature films during the 1950s and 1960s, including in the role of a singer in Catskills Honeymoon in 1950; Operation Mad Ball in 1957; Clark Gable's love interest in 1958s Run Silent Run Deep; The Lineup, also released in 1958; Gidget in 1959, in which she portrays the mother of Sandra Dee's title character; The Ladies Man in 1961; Bye Bye Birdie in 1963, playing the part of Ann Margaret's mother; and The Swinger in 1966. LaRoche was very active in television, usually in guest appearances in single episodes of a television series. She portrayed the title character's mother in Karen (1964). She acted on television as early as 1946, when she was part of a two-person skit that was broadcast on WBKB-TV in Chicago. Between 1951 and 1977 she appeared in 37 different television series, including five appearances on Perry Mason, two episodes of The Twilight Zone and an episode of The Streets of San Francisco in 1976. One of LaRoche's more complex and dramatic characterizations on television is in a one-hour episode of Gunsmoke in 1963, one titled \\"Quint-Cident\\". In that episode of the classic Western, in a central role opposite Burt Reynolds, she portrays a beleaguered and mentally exhausted widow trying to survive alone on an isolated farmstead in Kansas during the late 1870s. Personal life LaRoche was married to actor John Hudson and to actor-producer Sherwood Price.

Background Steve Jablonsky was hired to score the film, replacing Thurber's frequent composer, Theodore Shapiro. For the basis of the score, Jablonsky worked with traditional orchestra and blended looped guitar riffs which consisted of both acoustic and electric. He did this to make the film more realistic and gritty, avoiding the notion of a hero-esque theme. As for the character of Botha, Jablonsky discarded the use of an orchestra to represent the villain. So, he came up with a \\"unique percussion rhythm\\" by recording \\"tom-toms through several distortion pedals and a compressor.\\" which Thurber liked a lot. Luke Richards, Christian Wibe and Bryce Jacobs provided additional music. Track listing Track 18, Walls by Jamie N Commons, is played during the end credits of the film.

She was elected member of learned societies in various parts of the world; and served as a special delegate or representative to international expositions. It was, however, as an observer and especially as a writer, that Wright gained her fame. Her books were written about Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These volumes were generous octavos, well illustrated, and filled with facts gathered chiefly from authoritative sources or confirmed by her own observations. They ran through more than one edition, and were esteemed in the countries they described. She was a contemporary of Nellie Bly. Early years and education Marie Louise Robinson was born in Newnan, Georgia, May 4, 1853. Her father, John Evans Robinson, was a wealthy planter. She was descended from the Evans family of Wales, of which Sir George Evans was the head. Her father owned several plantations and hundreds of slaves. Her mother was Sarah Ramey Robinson, of Monroe County, Georgia. She had at least four siblings, John E. Robinson, Emmie Robinson, Mrs. A. B. Cates, and Mrs. George H. Carmichael. Wright was reared in luxury, and was educated at College Temple, Newnan. Career In 1870, at the age of sixteen, she ran away and married Hinton P. Wright (1849‚Äì1892). Mr. Wright was the son of a prominent lawyer, Judge W. F. Wright, who was distinguished for his scholarly attainments. In the previous year, Hinton Wright, in a boyish quarrel, inflicted injuries upon her brother which caused his death, and her parents disinherited her on the occasion of her marriage. Being bright and ambitious, she studied law with her husband, and sat by his side when he passed his final examination for the bar. They had two children, a daughter and a son. The ravages of the Civl War devastated the State of Georgia so that neither husband nor father had any property left. They divorced around 1886. After the death of Mr. Wright in 1892, she found herself compelled to earn a living for herself and her children. Wright went to the office of the magazine called the Sunny South, with a proposition that met the wants of the publishers. She asked for the privileges of traveling and soliciting subscriptions. Doubtless she had literary aspirations, but she knew that the business end of the magazine offered her a much quicker opportunity. She was engaged at once, and for two or three years, made a good living for herself and children, and materially increased the circulation of the periodical. Marie Robinson Wright So successful was Wright that a chance came from this work to go on to the New York World, not as a reporter or editorial writer, but to travel through the Southern cities and write them up for the daily paper. This work was even more successful. Her special line was descriptive writing and articles on new sections of the country. As special correspondent of the New York World in that department, she traveled from the British Provinces to Mexico in 1891. One of her noteworthy achievements during 1892 was her descriptive article of eight pages in the New York World on Mexico, supplemented by an illustrated souvenir of that country, for which the Mexican government paid the paper the sum of , in gold. It was the highest price ever paid for a newspaper article in its day. At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, she was again given an opportunity to distinguish herself by getting the illustrated edition of the Fair, again making several thousand dollars. Marie Robinson Wright \\"But why should I go on making enormous sums of money for other people?\\" she asked herself. \\"Have I not now sufficient ability and experience to stand alone?\\" She decided to try, and in 1895 with her daughter, Ida Dent Wright, for her sole companion, she went again to Mexico. Secretary of Foreign Affairs Ignacio Mariscal and President Porfirio D√≠az were already her warm admirers, and it was to them she went with her plans. Both these executives furnished her with letters to every governor in Mexico, and the President ordered, not only a military escort wherever needed, but that special trains and steamboat facilities should be given her throughout the country. Then she spent a year in thoroughly inspecting and studying the country. Besides thousands of miles of railway and steamboat traveling, Wright and her daughter went nearly in mountain regions, on mules, attended by military escort, and penetrating regions where none but indigenous women had been seen previously. The result of her experiences was put in a large, illustrated book on Mexico, which was the most comprehensive and beautiful book on Mexico ever written in any language, and which was ordered in advance by 8,000 Mexican officials. In addition to this, or as a result of her success, Wright was invited to Costa Rica to prepare a similar book for the government. As the years passed, she three times crossed South America, making a record trip over the Andes in 1904. Wright was a member of several press clubs and literary societies. She was sent to Paris as commissioner from the Georgia to the exposition, having been appointed by Governor John Brown Gordon, of Georgia. She served as vice- president for Georgia of the National Woman's Press Association. While she was absorbed in her regular work, she occasionally contributed to other papers and magazines. Personal life Wright made her home in New York City. She died February 1, 1914, in Liberty, New York.

Having unclean water can lead to many diseases that can potentially become fatal.Halvorson, Williams, Ba, & Dunkel. (2011). Water quality and waterborne disease in the Niger River Inland Delta, Mali: A study of local knowledge and response. Health and Place, 17(2), 449-457. Childhood diarrhea One major water-borne disease that affects the children population of Mali is childhood diarrhea. Childhood diarrhea is the primary cause of death for children in Mali. Many projects and research have been done in order to intervene and help reduce this problem. However, the numbers of children dying from waterborne diseases in Mali has actually risen.  Improved hygiene Studies have shown that improved hygiene has been effective in decreasing the mortality rate, a percentage that is incredibly high at 45% in some cases. It showed that improved hygiene was twice as effective at reducing waterborne diseases than improved drinking water sources. Improved water drinking sources was not as successful due to recontamination that may occur in a household, which can happen through situations such as water handling or the way water is stored.  Challenges = Open defecation= A common issue that occurs in Mali is open defecation. Over half of the people that do not have access to safe water live in rural areas. Diseases can easily be spread when fecal matter contaminates water sources, such as groundwater. The villagers can then easily drink the contaminated water or use it when preparing food. This may lead to villagers having diarrhea, which can further worsen malnutrition, which is already a problem in Mali. = Water quality at public institutions= Water sanitation and quality is also a problem at hospitals in Mali where water is not clean and toilets are not safe for women. In fact, those are in the list of the top five killers of women worldwide. Women who are about to deliver are at great risk of complications due to health centers being unable to prevent many infections. They often have to relieve themselves outside because public restrooms are not available. Only 20% of health facilities in Mali were reported to have clean water. The same situation arises when it comes to Malian schools. Only 57 percent of schools provide some sort of sanitation facility, an even smaller percentage of that provides students with separate gender restrooms.

It is found in the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka, and in southeastern Asia. The tuber and the fruit are used as herbal remedies and the plant is used as a cure for snake bites. The caterpillars of several species of butterfly feed on this plant; these include the tawny coster, the clipper, the common cruiser and the Tamil lacewing. Description From Thrissur,Kerala Adenia hondala is a climbing plant growing from a large irregular-shaped tuber. The woody, scrambling stems are thickened at the nodes. The leaves are alternate, with a tendril growing from each node, and these tendrils bear the flowers. The leaves are large and are deeply, palmately divided into three to five lobes; they have circular glands between the lobes. The flowers are greenish-white or bluish-white, each with a bell-shaped tube and five curled-back petals. The fruit is a capsule splitting into three valves with stiff rind and filled with seeds surrounded by fleshy white arils. The fruit is globular, green at first, turning orange as it ripens, and is poisonous. The fruits are poisonous and their resemblance to the fruits of the passion flower has led children to eat it mistakenly. Distribution This plant is native to tropical southeastern Asia, Vietmam and the southwestern part of India and Sri Lanka. Ecology The caterpillars of the tawny coster (Acraea terpsicore), the Tamil lacewing (Cethosia nietneri), the common cruiser (Vindula erota) and the clipper (Parthenos sylvia) feed on this plant. Uses The young shoots and leaf stalks can be cooked and eaten. The tubers, which are poisonous, have antibacterial and antimicrobial properties and are used in Ayurvedic medicine for the treatment of skin disorders and to treat hernias. The seeds are used to combat the effects of poison, and the tubers are used to make a drug known as \\"vidari\\" or \\"vidaari\\", although this pharmaceutical is also made from other plants, Ipomoea mauritiana, Pueraria tuberosa and Cycas circinalis. The plant is also used against snake bites. Status Adenia hondala is a generally uncommon species. In Tamil Nadu its conservation status is listed as being near threatened while in Kerala and Karnataka it is listed as being vulnerable.

Hall was betrayed and captured behind enemy lines during a self-proposed sabotage mission in the region south of the Brenner Pass in January 1945. After one month of captivity he was executed by the Schutzstaffel (SS), who covered up his murder as a cardiac arrest. His murderers were put on trial by a US military tribunal after the war, in 1946, and three of them sentenced to death and executed while a fourth one was sentenced to life imprisonment. Pre-war life Hall was born in 1915 in Beijing in what was then the Republic of China. His father, Ray Ovid Hall (1891‚Äì1951), was an international business man and his mother, Gertrude Cliff (Goodspeed) Hall (1881‚Äì1964), was a doctor. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated in 1934. He travelled internationally and visited the Italian Alps and, especially, the area around the Brenner Pass, where he spent his time climbing, hiking and skiing, becoming very familiar with the area. By profession, Hall was a geologist.Steinacher, Page: 273 When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and the United States were drawn into the war, Hall had just returned to the US from his travels and had enrolled at Yale University. Mission =Preparation= Hall dropped out of university and enlisted as a private, quickly rising through the ranks, eventually being promoted to Second Lieutenant. Recognising the strategic importance of the Brenner Pass for the supply of the German and Italian forces in the Mediterranean, Hall wrote a letter to the OSS in autumn 1943, proposing a mission against the Pass. In his letter he volunteered to parachute into northern Italy, in the area west of Cortina d'Ampezzo, around the Falzarego Pass, with tools, supplies and explosives. From there he would either single- handedly or with the help of local resistance attack the minor roads and passes in the region leading up to the Brenner to disrupt Axis supply routes. He was aware that his chances of withdrawal from the region were slim but hoped to hide out in the area until the end of the war. To his surprise the letter aroused the interest of the Special Operations branch of the OSS, responsible, among other things, for sabotage. Hall was ordered to report to Washington. He received his initial training in the US and was then sent to Algiers, North Africa, as a demolitions expert. A mission directly against the Brenner Pass was seen as unrealistic, partly because local partisan support seemed unlikely given that the inhabitants of the region of South Tyrol, also part of Italy, were predominantly ethnic Germans.Steinacher, Page: 274 In June 1944 Hall was sent to Caserta, Italy, where he joined the 2677th OSS Regiment, and trained with a team of agents for his mission. Hall briefly returned to Algiers for a parachuting course before embarking with his team to the Italian mountains for language and survival skills training. =Mission behind enemy lines= On 2 August 1944 Hall and his team parachuted into northern Italy, being dropped at Monte Pala, 85 miles south of the Brenner Pass. The group consisted of Captain Lloyd G. Smith, its commander, First Lieutenant Joseph Lukitsch, Hall, radio operator Stanley Sbeig, a Navy specialist, and Technician third grade Victor Malaspino. They damaged an unguarded bridge at Tolmezzo with explosives and continued to do so on smaller bridges while travelling north. Severe weather conditions hampered the efforts and the team was eventually forced to hide out in a small village, with Hall suffering from severe frostbite on his feet, hoping to hide out there until the end of the war. Apart from sabotage Hall was also engaged in contacting local Italian partisan groups, organising supply drop offs and gaining intelligence on the Alpine Fortress, a German fortification project. =Capture= On 25 January 1945 Hall went north again, now on his own and on skis, with orders to blow up the dam at Cortina d' Ampezzo. The next day, unable to move because of the effects of frostbite on his feet, Hall was discovered by a game warden. Hall hid with a local priest but the game warden, under the pretext of getting help, turned him over to the local Fascist police. Hall was subsequently betrayed by one of his own partisans who identified him as an OSS agent. Hall did not resist his captors, two police officers from Cortina, and was eventually handed over to the SS in Bolzano.Steinacher, Page: 278 Murder Hall was handed over to the SS who run the Bolzano concentration camp, where he was tortured. He was hanged in the torture chamber of the camp on 20 February 1945, but his death was covered up to appear as a cardiac arrest. The Italian doctor who signed the death certificate was himself a prisoner at the camp and was not actually permitted to see the body. During negotiations in Switzerland between high ranking SS officials and US representatives, Operation Sunrise, the latter demanded for Hall to be exchanged or freed as a token of good will but Hall was already dead at this time.Steinacher, Pages: 283‚Äì284 Two other OSS agents captured around the time at Belluno were destined to suffer the same fate as Hall but were rescued when the US, through channels in Switzerland, informed the German high command that they expected the prisoners to be treated in accordance with the Geneva convention as they had been captured in uniform, thereby saving their lives.Steinacher, Page: 284 Trial Heinrich Andergassen during his trial As Hall had been in uniform at the time of his capture his execution had been in contravention of the Geneva Convention, making it a war crime. When OSS officers entered the camp at the end of the war they managed to identify Hall's grave, giving him a proper military burial. The records found at the camp served as evidence at the trial in Naples in 1946. Untersturmf√ºhrer Heinrich Andergassen, one of the chief suspects for the murder, confessed to the murder during interrogation on 1 July 1945 and implicated three others, Sturmbannf√ºhrer August Schiffer, Oberscharf√ºhrer Albert Storz and Gendarmerie officer Hans Butz in his confession. Schiffer unsuccessfully used the infamous Commando Order as defence for his actions. Andergassen, Schiffer and Storz were sentenced to death on 19 July 1946 by a US military tribunal with the execution scheduled for a week later, while the fourth man, Butz, was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the murder.Steinacher, Page: 285 Apart from the murder of Hall the four were also found guilty of the murder of six other Allied servicemen, pilot Charles Parker, SAS officers Roger Littlejohn and David Crowley as well as US airmen George Hammond, Hardy Narron and Medard Tafoya.O'Donnell, Chapter: 46 Recognition Captain Roderick Stephen Hall was posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit, \\"for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services in Italy from 2 August 1944 to 27 January 1945\\". Hall, who also received the Purple Heart for having been killed, is buried at the Florence American Cemetery and Memorial in Florence, Tuscany.

Biography  = Origin = Peter was born in in Reval in the Governorate of Estonia (present-day Tallinn, Estonia), to Peter Hermann von Baranoff and Marie Louise Simplicie Pauline von Nicolay (ru). Stackelberg, Otto Magnus v. Genealogical Handbook of the Estonian Knighthood, vol. 1.

The Baranoffs was originally Russian boyar who entered Swedish service after Estonia was ceased to the Swedish under the conclusion of the Treaty of Teusina at the end of the Russo-Swedish War From 1590 to 1595. And many of them, quickly adapted to the Germanic traditions, converted to Lutheranism, and quickly became Baltic German subjects, including the Baranoffs, which was headed by four brothers: Voin, Fyodor, Kasyan and Menshik Baranov, Stackelberg, Otto Magnus v. Genealogical Handbook of the Estonian Knighthood, vol. 1. G√∂rlitz (1931), pp. 18 which they changed their surname from Baranov to Baranoff to be more better suited into German. The descendants of Voin and Fyodor quickly died out in the late-17th Century, while the descendants of Kasyan survived they died out in the late-19th Century, but the descendants of Menshik, which Peter was directly descended from, are still surviving til today. Stackelberg, Otto Magnus v. Genealogical Handbook of the Estonian Knighthood, vol. 1. G√∂rlitz (1931), pp. 25 The family was enrolled into Swedish nobility in 1666. In 1745, the Estonian high count gave an appeal the \\"Attestatum nobilitaris\\", that under the conclusion \\"that from 1592 on the Baranoff family was to be brought under local nobility\\". So the family was enrolled into the Estonian Knighthood that same year, the family was also enrolled into the Livonian and Oesel Knighthoods (de) following the years 1830 and 1843 simultaneously.

Home-grown militant groups have associated themselves with ISIL. It is uncertain whether attacks in Bangladesh are orchestrated by ISIL, are independently planned and claimed by the group, or are later attributed to ISIL. ISIL's targets in Bangladesh are often foreigners, secular bloggers or journalists who are vocal in their opposition to the enforcement of Sharia law and the establishment of an Islamic state.  Background  = ISIL in South Asia = ISIL flag ISIL activity originated in Iraq, and has spread from the Middle East to the African countries of Egypt, Mali and Somalia; South Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan and India, and southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines. The group aims to retake Greater Khorasan, a historical region which covers Afghanistan and part of Central Asia. The Khorasan branch of ISIL is based in South Asia. The terrorist organisation has used social unrest, the dissolution of language barriers, and local underground support to recruit South Asian militants for global jihad. The flow of Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar has been targeted for recruitment by ISIL when the refugees enter Bangladesh. Some of these refugees are also targeted and supported by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (BJeI), the country's largest Islamist political party. In 2002, the Bangladeshi extremist group Jamatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) formed a committee in Malda City, India. JMB is the most active extremist group in Bangladesh, and has linked itself to ISIL. The group exploited permeable borders between India and Bangladesh to transport explosives, and are believed to be responsible for the Bardham bombing near the India-Bangladesh border in 2014. JMB, which was funded and militarized by the Taliban in the AfPak region before receiving ISIL support, targets minorities in Bangladesh. Attacks inspired by ISIL have occurred across South Asia, including Quetta, Pakistan, Kabul, Afghanistan and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Youths from these countries have increasingly travelled from South Asia to Syria and Iraq. ISIL influences, recruits, strategises and organises with social media. Indian cells of ISIL have been identified by Indian forces in Madhya Pradesh, Kalyan, Kerala, Hyderabad, and Uttar and Madhya Pradesh. ISIL is most present in India through online social networks. The group has also attempted to infiltrate the unstable state of Jammu and Kashmir, a region disputed by India and Pakistan for religious and territorial reasons. = ISIL in Bangladesh, 1971-2015 = Bangladesh is a secular democracy with a majority-Muslim population and a low median standard of living. Since its independence from Muslim Pakistan in 1971, Islamic extremism and the push for a united Islamic state across the subcontinent has been a catalyst for homegrown action and international interest in Bangladesh. Bombings, shootings and stabbings have been claimed by ISIL, targeting Westerners and other foreigners and Shia Muslims. Most attacks in Bangladesh are made by proxy groups later claimed (or attributed) to ISIL, and the amount of direct ISIL influence is unclear. In June 2014, ISIL declared themselves a worldwide caliphate with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as their leader. That August, ISIL distributed a video of Bengalis pledging allegiance to the group in Bengali. Bangladesh was not included in the group's five-year plan published that year, despite its being a Muslim-majority country. Since 2015, the government of Bangladesh has adopted a vocal, zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism and Islamic extremism. ISIL has admitted targeting (and attacking) secular Bangladeshis, Shia Muslims, foreigners, bloggers and other individuals who oppose their goal. The group has a sizable online presence in Bangladesh through social media, and a growing physical influence (despite government denial). Domestic terrorist organizations are increasingly active with the support of transnational organizations such as ISIL, both physically and online through social media. Since 2013, over 40 vocal secularists have been murdered by these homegrown groups. According to JMB and ISIL, JMB members were acting on ISIL's behalf in Bangladesh. The group recruits in wealthy areas of Dhaka (such as Banani) and in places where youths gather for studying and coaching. The Bangladeshi government calls the group the \\"neo-JMB\\".  Timeline  = 2015 = *May: A deadly attack was carried out by the ISIL- affiliated extremist group Jundullah in which 46 Shia Muslims were targeted for their opposing religious views. *28 September: Italian citizen Tavella Cesare was murdered whilst jogging in Dhaka. The Bangladeshi suspects told police that they were hired by an entity they called \\"Big Brother\\" to kill a foreigner. Although none of the arrested men made any overt reference to ISIL, the attack was claimed by the terrorist group. *3 October: Japanese national Kunio Hoshi was shot to death in a village in Rangpur District. Although the police blamed JMB for the attack, responsibility was claimed by ISIL in their online publication. *24 October: ISIL affiliates claimed responsibility for a bombing outside Huseini Dalan, a place of worship in Dhaka, where the attackers targeted a Shi‚Äôite gathering. One person was killed, and about 100 were injured. *November: An interview, \\"The Revival of Jihad in Bengal\\", was published in the ISIL magazine Dabiq. *4 November: ISIL claimed responsibility for an attack on a police checkpoint in which a police officer was killed. *25 November: The group claimed responsibility for a suicide attack at an Ahmadiyya mosque. In addition to the dead bomber, about a dozen people were injured. = 2016 = During the first six months of 2016, ISIL carried out eleven attacks throughout Bangladesh. They launched religiously-motivated attacks against Hindus in Bonpara, Dhaka, Jhenaidah and Rangpur, Christians in Bonpara, Rangpur and Kushtia District, and targeted a Buddhist leader in Jhenaidah. *22 February: The group took responsibility for an attack in northern Bangladeshi Panchagarh District in which Jogeswar Roy, a Hindu priest, was killed and two others injured. *14 March: Hafiz Abdul Razak, a Shia cleric, was stabbed to death in Jhenaidah District in an assassination for which ISIL claimed responsibility. *23 April: University professor Rezaul Karim Siddique was murdered with machetes in Rajshahi. Although responsibility for the attack was claimed by ISIL, officials believed that it may have been a copycat crime rather than one committed by the group. *25 April: Two men were killed with machetes by militants in an attack claimed by ISIL. One, Xulhaz Mannan, was an activist for gay rights in Bangladesh. Editor of the country's only LGBT magazine, he had been living at the American embassy in Dhaka. *25 May: The murder of a Hindu businessman was attributed to the group. *7 June: A Hindu monk was murdered by militants in western Bangladesh in an attack claimed by ISIL, and an elderly Christian grocer was hacked to death in Bonpara. *1 July: On the last Friday of Ramadan, five young JMB members stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka's Gulshan Thana neighbuorhood. Its occupants were taken hostage, and the attackers targeted foreigners or Muslims not deemed sufficiently devout. Twenty-two people were killed (18 of whom were foreigners), and 50 others were injured. It was the largest extremist attack in Bangladesh since 1996. The attackers discriminated between foreigners and Bangladeshi citizens, and (of the Bangladeshis) between fundamentalist and moderate Muslims. Those who could quote the Quran were spared and treated well, and those who could not were executed. The attack was broadcast live to ISIL-affiliated social-media accounts with the bakery's WiFi. Photos of the attackers in front of ISIL flags were displayed. Bangladesh's prime minister denied ISIL involvement, attributing the attack to domestic militancy. It was the worst attack in over a decade, when JMB set of synchronised bombs throughout Bangladesh which killed two dozen people. *7 July: A suicide attack near the Eidgah in Sholakia killed four members of a large Eid al-Fitr congregation. It was prompted by ISIL and their followers' belief that any form of Islam other than Salafism is too moderate and justifies jihad. = 2017 = *17 March: A militant suspected of being a JMB member entered a Rapid Action Battalion compound with an explosive belt in an attempted suicide-bomb attack. The attacker detonated his vest when he was approached by two compound officials, killing himself and wounding them. *24 March: ISIL claimed responsibility for a failed suicide-bomb attack at a police checkpoint near Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka. The attack killed the militant, but there were no other injuries. It was suspected that the bomb detonated prematurely. *25 March: Eight people were killed, including two police officers, and more than 40 were injured in a dual bombing in Sylhet. Military and police forces were attempting to raid a militant safe house believed to belong to ISIL when the explosions occurred; one came from a man on a motorbike, and the other was planted in a bag of vegetables. According to the Bangladesh Army, the militants were detonating other bombs around the city. The attack occurred on the first observance of Bengali Genocide Remembrance Day. *November: A Biman Bangladesh Airlines pilot pled guilty to conspiring to crash a passenger plane into Ganabhaban, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's residence.  Bangladeshi response  About half of the Bangladeshi population supports, or can justify, the suicide attacks committed by Islamic extremists. Although some support comes from the poor, young men with a relatively-good standard of living are more supportive of suicide attacks than the well- educated. Poorer people in the cities are most likely to oppose Islamist violence and suicide bombings because of the direct impact on their lives. Wealthier people in more-affluent areas are less likely than their poorer counterparts to experience the ramifications of Islamist violence. Despite many attacks attributed to ISIL by police and claimed by the organization, the government denies its presence in Bangladesh and has been slow to react to homegrown threats. One reason for the denial is Bangladesh's position as home to the world's second-largest garment industry (after China). Terrorist attacks and a government-confirmed ISIL presence might damage foreign trust in the country, affecting travel and trade. JMB leader Bangla Bhai was hanged in 2007 for murder. The group has been announced as an ISIL branch in Bangladesh, despite the government's denial of an ISIL presence in the country. The United States Office of Foreign Assets Control and the State Department have identified an \\"ISIS-Bangladesh\\", citing the 2015 murder of Tavella Cesare and the July 2016 Dhaka attack as evidence of an ISIL presence in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi government is enlisting international organizations and local community leaders to help alter local acceptance of Islamic extremist actions in the country. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked other countries with ISIL activity in diaspora communities, such as the United Kingdom, to take preventive action against individuals who are radicalising communities and transplanting ideology (and militancy) back to Bangladesh; the diaspora community in England has proven ties to ISIL and JMB. To bolster governmental strength in Bangladesh, the country have cooperated with the United States to fortify their borders against bi-directional militant migration. The Bangladesh Coast Guard, Navy Special Warfare and Diving Salvage unit and the army's 1st Para-Commando Battalion were trained by the U.S. Special Operations Command Pacific in 2015. Bangladesh's government has committed itself to the anti-terrorist movement, participating in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation counter-terrorist protocols and adopting the stance and measures promoted by the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. They are part of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering, which aims to thwart financing of militants and terrorist organizations. Although the Antiterrorism Act of 2009 does not explicitly outlaw recruitment and migration (fundamental to the spread of terrorism), legal action has been taken against individuals suspected of facilitating recruitment in Bangladesh and abroad.

Background 200px The economy of Sivakasi is dependent on three major industries: firecrackers, matchbox manufacturing, and printing.Urban Infrastructure Report 2008, p. 1 The town has 520 registered printing industries, 53 match factories, 32 chemical factories, seven soda factories, four flour mills and two rice and oil mills. The town is the nodal center for firecracker manufacturing at the national level. In 2011, the industry employed over 25,000 people and some of the private enterprises had an annual turnover of . In 2011, the combined estimated turnover of the firecracker, matchbox making and printing industry in the town was around . Approximately 70% of the firecrackers and matches produced in India are from Sivakasi. The hot and dry climate of the town is conducive to the firecracker and matchbox making industries. The raw materials for these industries were procured from Sattur earlier but were discontinued due to the high power and production cost. The source of raw materials is Kerala and Andaman. The paper for the printing industry is procured from various states.Urban Infrastructure Report 2008, pp. 12‚Äì13 The town is a major producer of diaries, contributing to 30% of the total diaries produced in India. Printing industry in the town was initially utilized for printing labels for the firecrackers and later evolved with modern machinery to grow as a printing hub. In 2012, all the industries suffered 15‚Äì20% production loss due to power shortage and escalating labor cost. The major issues in the fireworks industry in Sivakasi is child labour and frequent accidents. In a blast in 1991 in a factory, 39 people were killed and 65 others were injured. In July 2009, more than 40 people were killed in a fire accident in a firecracker unit. The police traced out unregistered units and irregularities that led to the accident. In a fire accident in August 2011, seven people were killed and five were seriously injured. A similar fire accident and blast in a private unit in September 2012 killed 40 people and injured 38 others.

The songs descend from the musical traditions of the Burmese royal court, and form the basis of Burmese classical music today.  History  The MahƒÅgƒ´ta evolved into a single style from Pyu, Mon, and Burman musical traditions. The MahƒÅgƒ´ta also incorporates musical traditions of conquered kingdoms; the Yodaya songs are modeled on the musical style of the Ayutthaya kingdom, while the Talaing songs are based on the songs of the Mon people. =Pre-colonial origins= Kyo, bwe, and thachingan songs are considered to constitute the oldest parts of the MahƒÅgƒ´ta repertoire, and served as the main court music before the Konbaung dynasty. The earliest genre of kyo songs date to the late Kingdom of Ava era. Kyo, which literally means \\"string,\\" were used as repertoire to teach traditional classical singing and the saung. The oldest songs of the kyo genre are the \\"Three Barge Songs,\\" which describe a king's passage up the Irrawaddy River to Tagaung in c. 1370, have variously been dated to the late Toungoo period (1531-1752). The \\"Three Barge Songs\\" include \\"Phaung Ngin Kyo,\\" (·Äñ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏) played as the barge is towed out; \\"Phaung La Kyo,\\" (·Äñ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äú·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏) played as the barge is underway; and \\"Phaung Saik Kyo,\\" (·Äñ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏), played when the barge makes port. Bwe songs honor the king, while thachingan songs honor the Buddha or the king as a protector of the ≈öƒÅsana. Both genres date to the Konbaung dynasty, c. 1738. Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa was the most prominent composer of songs in the bwe and thachingan genres. Patpyo songs were popular in the late Konbaung dynasty, and are the most numerous in the corpus. These songs have a rhythmic foundation resembling drum beats, and require the highest level of performance technique and knowledge. Ledwethankhet songs constitute a minor genre, and are characteristically sharp and active, with fast, short rhythms. These songs are always followed by myingin songs traditionally performed at equestrian, martial arts, and archery events. Bawle songs, which are plaintive songs, date to the 1800s; the earliest song, Sein Chu Kya Naung, composed by a Konbaung princess to persuade her husband to return to her side, was composed after 1838. =Colonial era evolution= With the advent of British colonial rule in Burma, a new genre of traditional music, variously called khit haung (·ÄÅ·Ä±·Äê·Ä∫·Äü·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏), hnaung khit (·Äî·Äæ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä±·Äê·Ä∫), and kala paw (·ÄÄ·Ä¨·Äú·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫) emerged. While the roots of this genre lie in the pre-colonial court tradition, compositions from this genre gradually incorporated Western musical instruments (e.g., the piano, guitar, banjo, etc.) and foreign musical influences in terms of melody, tunings, and rhythm (e.g., harmony in thirds, accented rhythm in vocals), which did not adhere to the strict rules of the royal court musical tradition. From the 1920s to the 1940s, the introduction of recording technology created a sizable local market for khit haung music. The Burmese government MRTV publishes multi-volume written compilation of songs from this genre.  Collections  The MahƒÅgƒ´ta is generally organized into songs by genre based on varying tuning methods, rhythmic patterns, frequently used melodies, preludes and postludes, as follows: * Kyo (·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏) * Bwe (·Äò·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑) * Thachingan (·Äû·ÄÆ·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä∂) * Patpyo (·Äï·Äê·Ä∫·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏) *Ledwethankhet () *Natchin (·Äî·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) *Yodaya (·Äö·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äí·Äö·Ä¨·Ä∏) *Bawle (·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·Äú·Äö·Ä∫) * Lwangyin (·Äú·ÄΩ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) * Myingin (·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) *Talaing than (·Äê·Äú·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äû·Ä∂) In the Gitawithawdani anthology, the songs are grouped into 4 categories are known as apaing (·Ä°·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏). Each category has a specific tuning method, namely hnyinlon, aukpyan, pale, and myinzaing. The remaining 2 tuning methods, duraka and chauk thwe nyunt, are now extinct. Ensemble MahƒÅgƒ´ta songs are sung by a vocalist who controls the metric cycle by playing a bell (·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫, si) and clappers (·Äù·Ä´·Ä∏, wa). The vocal performances are accompanied by a chamber music ensemble, which includes the following instruments: * Saung (·ÄÖ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏) - Burmese harp * Pattala (·Äï·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Äú·Ä¨·Ä∏) - xylophone * Hne (·Äî·Äæ·Ä≤·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏) - double-reed oboe * Si (·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏) and wa (·Äù·Ä´·Ä∏) - bell and clapper * Bon (·Äó·ÄØ·Ä∂) - double-headed drum * Tayaw (·Äê·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨) - fiddle * Sandaya (·ÄÖ·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏) - piano The tayaw and sandaya are historically recent additions dating to the late pre- colonial era (late 1800s).  Anthologies  The national anthology, known as Naingngandaw Mu Mahagita (·Äî·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÑ·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äô·Ä∞·Äô·Äü·Ä¨·ÄÇ·ÄÆ·Äê) includes a selection of 169 songs, standardized and published in three volumes between 1954 and 1961 by Burmese Ministry of Culture. The National University of Arts and Culture, Yangon uses the Naingngandaw Mu Mahagita as the official anthology for teaching Burmese classical music. This anthology is also used for the National Performing Arts Competition (also known as Sokayeti) held annually in October. The Naingngandaw Mu Mahagita anthology is based on an earlier anthology, entitled Gitawithawdani (·ÄÇ·ÄÆ·Äê·Äù·Ä≠·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨·Äì·Äî·ÄÆ; from Pali Gƒ´tavisodhana, lit. \\"purifying the songs\\"), published in 1923, which was based on the repertoire of the last Burmese court harpist, Dewaeinda Maung Maung Gyi (·Äí·Ä±·Äù·Ä£·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Ä¨·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÆ·Ä∏). The second edition was edited and recompiled by Ba Cho and republished in 1941, and is now in its sixth reprint. The oldest extant song anthology was compiled c. 1788 by the Monywe Sayadaw (1766-1834), and comprises 166 sets of song texts. Several Konbaung dynasty anthologies exist, including an 1849 anthology compiled by Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa and another 1870 anthology, Thachin Gaungzin Potye Hmatsudaw (·Äû·ÄÆ·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä±·Ä´·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÖ·Äâ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄØ·Äí·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏·Äô·Äæ·Äê·Ä∫·ÄÖ·ÄØ·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫) with 1,062 song titles under 27 genres, both compiled at the behest of Mindon Min, and an 1881 anthology named Mahagita Myedani Kyan (·Äô·Äü·Ä¨·ÄÇ·ÄÆ·Äê·Äô·Äº·Ä±·Äì·Äî·ÄÆ·ÄÄ·Äª·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏), compiled by U Yauk in Pyay. Modern-day usage The popularity of the MahƒÅgƒ´ta genre in modern- day Myanmar has declined significantly with the advent of popular music. Some songs in the MahƒÅgƒ´ta corpus, such as a bwe song called \\"Aura of Immeasurable Auspiciousness\\" (·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äô·Äû·Ä≠·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äû·Äº·Äò·Ä¨·Äò·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑, Ataing Mathi Mingala Awba Bwe), a wedding processional song used in traditional Burmese weddings (analogous to the \\"Bridal Chorus\\" in Western weddings), remain staples for various traditional ceremonies. The style of MahƒÅgƒ´ta songs has also been adapted in more modern compositions, such as \\"Auspicious Song\\" (·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÇ·Äú·Ä¨·Äê·Ä±·Ä∏, Mingala Tei) composed by Twante Thein Tan, and \\"Akadaw Pei\\" (·Ä°·ÄÅ·Ä´·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äï·Ä±·Ä∏) by Waing Lamin Aung, both of which are commonly played at traditional Burmese weddings.

Expanded in both the 17th and 18th centuries, The Cwm is a Grade II* listed building, its listing describing it as \\"a substantial farmhouse of distinctive T-plan\\". History and description Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan, in their three-volume guide Monmouthshire Houses, give an original construction date of the late 16th century, with the roof of the main Tudor block dating from 1600. They ascribe the wing to the South to the early 17th and 18th centuries, with Cadw ascribing the North wing to the same 18th century building phase. Fox and Raglan consider the style of the structure indicates a national, rather than a regional, influence.. The architectural historian John Newman notes the stone window frames, with recessed spandrels and arched windows, which he considers \\"most unusual\\". Nothing is known of the builders or early owners. By the 1840s, the farmhouse was part of the Monmouthshire estates of the Dukes of Beaufort and was let to a William Blower, along with 104 acres of land.

Vedic chanting The brothers have been chanting vedas since childhood, having learnt from their father Sri. M.Sampathkumaracharya and teaching the vedas since 1992, after learning from their Guru Sri Anantakrishna Ghanapathigalu and Sri Anantanarayana Ghanapathigalu. Their renditions of Purushasuktam, Rudram, Chamakam, Shanti mantras, Taitriyam, Upanishads, Mahanyasam and other Vedic chants and suktas are popularly held in India as one of the most authentic chants. They hold public performances, at temples and ceremonies, for the general public. Srinivasan has also been teaching Vedic chanting to ladies and gents since 1992. He commenced the first ladies batch on 4 November 1992 with 3 ladies who were interested in learning to chant vedas. They now have more than 500 students who chant with great synchronisation. Srinivasan and Madhu's daughter, Shreeraksha is a child prodigy in Vedic chanting. At the age of six, she became the first lady to chant the vedas in the inner shrine of the Ramakrishna Math Bangalore during navaratri. She has also chanted vedas at various programmes and events. They also teach online classes. Etymology The name \\"Challakere brothers\\" is derived from their surname, which in turn is derived from their native place in Challakere, Karnataka. Personal life The brothers live in Bangalore, India. In an interview in 2016, Sreenivasan mentioned that his wife Madhu Sreenivasan had married him in 1996 on the condition that he would teach her chanting. He also discredits the fallacy that Vedic chanting negatively affects women, as he and his wife had a child three years after their marriage. Their child turned out to be a prodigy in Veda chanting and teaches others now. The brothers have been teaching the chanting of vedas for 25 years at the Trayee Veda Vidyalaya at Banashankari in Bangalore.

Meuwissen is renowned as an influential advisor for wealthy Russian-speaking clientele, special among Russian oligarchs.  Business career  At the age of 25 he began his real estate business and in 2008 established his own company Property4East. In 2010 he cooperated with Chelsea Football Club owned by Roman Abramovich that offered its Millennium Suites to rent it out. Since 2014 Meuwissen starts to relocate the first Russian oligarchs to the Netherlands. In November 2017 Meuwissen sold a Kazakh government official a luxurious high-security flat in Paris for ‚Ç¨65 million (US$75.8 million) that Mansion Global named one of the priciest residential transactions in the city this year. The Kazakh, who bought an apartment for 65 million euros in Paris, decided to re-sell the apartment, for 125 million euros. This is twice the price for which he bought it. The authorities of Kazakhstan are trying to find out who bought the luxury apartment in Paris for 65 million euros, but Meuwissen doesn't want to mention who the buyer is. Various media reports state that the penthouse may have been purchased by the vast riches accrued by Kazakhstan's ruling Nazarbayev family. BBC reported on March 10, revealed that assets owned by Dariga Nazarbayeva, of the speaker of the Senate and the president's daughter, and her son, Nurali Aliyev. End 2018 Meuwissen signed with Mohammad Zahoor a partnership to launch Property4East.com in 2019, the first platform for brokers and owners of luxury real estate specialized for Russian, Kazakh and Ukrainian clientele in collaboration with Eastern European major media channels. In 2019 Meuwissen signed an agreement with financial specialist PWC and a private bank to move 15‚Äì20 families of Eastern European origin from Kazakhstan, Russia and Ukraine to new locations in the Benelux, due to the Brexit. This operation won't do him any harm since he has been instructed to sell the British homes of the Eastern European families for a fee of 6%. According to well-informed sources, the estimated transaction value of the entire UK portfolio is worth more than 1 billion euros. The portfolio of relocation homes in the Benelux would exceed 200 million euros. In July 2019, Meuwissen completed the business transaction to sell 20 homes for 500 million pounds in the better suburbs of London to large real estate agent groups in the world. The total initial value of the contract was estimated at a sales value of 1 billion pounds, based on an analysis by Knight Frank. Meuwissen, known for its harsh statements and knowledge of the market, values the global value of the homes at 500 million, with the fact that London is no longer \\"hot\\". Meuwissen had signed the deal with an investment bank on the basis of a consortium contract at a 6% reimbursement of which 4.5% as a success fee. On the transaction, he earns 1.5% fee that must be paid over the maximum duration of 2 years, with a watchful eye on the transactions on behalf of his clientele. The deal was guided by the law firm Magic Circle (law firms). Philanthropy Friends4East support economic and business-mission of West Europe, with Eastern Europe, focused on Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The organization also supports cultural and artistic projects, talented people including supporting animal foundations, especially cats. Since 2015 Meuwissen supports yearly Mohammad Zahoor and his wife Kamaliya with her foundation to help children in need. The foundation organizes annual charity nights to raise money. On 18 November 2017 in Luxembourg the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities with the support of Friends4East and the Russian Ambassador to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Viktor Sorokin opened the space exhibition #Sputnik60 to celebrate 60 years since Sputnik became the first satellite in space and changed the world forever. Books In 2015 Meuwissen collaborated with the publisher teNeues as author for the coffeetable book Living in Style Morocco sold at Amazon. In 2018 Meuwissen has asked by the publisher teNeues to collaborate in different projects as member of advisory board.

It was released on October 19, 2018 on Domino. Its creation was influenced by a spiritually intense period in Krell's life, as well as his renewed interest in experimental electronic music that he had explored at the beginning of his career. Background and influences The Anteroom was conceptualized when Krell relocated to Los Angeles after the United States 2016 election, and was created as a 'testament' to the two-year spiritually exploratory and intense period in his life that followed where he \\"felt [himself] slipping out of the world and into a cosmic loneliness in which [he] would eventually be dissolved\\". With the album, he aimed to return to the experimental sounds of his early work, but more cohesive and detailed; the press release describes the album as a 'single continuous piece of 21st century psychedelic music'. The press release for The Anteroom described the album as utilizing 'blizzardous electronic noise, fragile melodies and poignant poetry', and compared the album to a weighted blanket. It also detailed the album's artistic and literary inspirations, citing: > Inspired by Coil (especially the \\"Moon Musick\\" phase), Robert Ashley, Kathy > Acker, Helena Hauff, Neil Landstrumm, Front 242, Paul B. Preciado, \\"Acid Mt. > Fuji,\\" Dambudzo Marechera, Vatican Shadow, Joy Division's Unknown Pleasures, > Alec Empire, Akira Rabelais, Frank Bidart, Basic Channel, Ocean Vuong, > Silvia Federici, Maggie Nelson, Alejandra Pizarnik, demonic negative > transcendence, the end of life on the earth: How to Dress Well presents The > Anteroom. Krell also published a Spotify playlist titled \\"The Anteroom Influences (LOTOU 1.1)\\" which documented the album's overall musical influences, as well as songs he listened to before and after the production of the album. Artist and producer Joel Ford, who contributed to The Anteroom, was described as a 'technical facilitator' and a medium, and Krell admitted that his production on the album lead to his interest and passion for music being renewed, after a prior negative experience. Krell coped with 'super mangled emotions' through Ford's presence in the studio. They also developed the phrase \\"Incomplete Picture\\", which described their production process and tendencies to engage in minimalism and creating 'openness for the listening act'. Concept and composition The Anteroom is stylistically radically different from Krell's prior album under How To Dress Well, \\"Care\\" (2016), which was focused strictly on contemporary R&B; and synthpop. In comparison, The Anteroom focuses deeply on experimental electronic music, ambient music and post-industrial music with abstracted pop songwriting, which was described as 'bewitching sound experimentation'. Prior to the album's release, Krell addressed that he was 'no longer making music for the algorithm', and has called it his 'most sonically, biographically and conceptually detailed and intense record to date'. He also admitted that he 'got in such an intense space mentally', and that the final album was 'this kind of big, exquisite corpse of itself'. The album also lyrically addresses elements of Krell's own personal life, most emphasized on \\"Nonkilling 6 Hunger\\", \\"July 13 No Hope No Pain\\", and \\"Love Means Taking Action\\". The album features literary and poetic references; the title track, \\"The Anteroom\\", lyrically references Maggie Nelson's \\"Bluets\\" multiple times, \\"Nonkilling 6 Hunger\\" begins with a sample of Li-Young Lee's \\"The Cleaving\\", and \\"Brutal False Skull 5\\" uses vocal samples of poems by Ocean Vuong, Anne Sexton and Frank Bidart. Krell commented that 'the way [he] write[s] is very free associative', and that he 'had a canon of books [he] was reading; over and over, books of poetry that were essential'; he compared himself to a channel for such works. =Album art= The album cover of The Anteroom, different for the CD and vinyl editions, was created by Krell in collaboration with artist and friend Joshua Clancy. The deluxe vinyl edition in particular features art created in a 'VR cave' on the Oculus Rift, which they described as a 'hyper-Lascaux at the end of the world'.

Two of the crewmembers die on impact, leaving only their captain, Alexander Chapaev, a surviving member. He starts counting his days on the planet, aided only by a still working radio communication with Earth, as well as a robotic drone to keep him company. On Earth, all efforts to bring Alexander back home turn into quarrels between the government and the space agency, until some private investor proposes his help. However, it soon turns out to be a hoax, since the company sending Alexander subsistence for survival decides to turn his broadcast into a reality show, and is not interested in getting the astronaut back to Earth at all. Bereft of his family, Chapaev starts having mind-boggling hallucinations and meets an entity who reveals to be sentient Mars lifeform. The film ends with Chapaev not knowing what is real and what isn't anymore, while it is hinted that the whole mission was staged only to raise TV ratings among the viewers.

It was considered the worst grossing movie in Russian film history, until it was surpassed by Spitak within the same year.

She was also arrested by the Nazis. Life and family Born about 1885 in Stuttgart as Barbara \\"Babette\\" B√∂ger, daughter of forester John B√∂ger. Her family moved to Dublin where the family changed their name to Baker. They were Lutheran with an interest in the Latter Day Saint movement. They were baptised into the Church of Latter Day Saints by missionaries sent by the Preston England Temple and established a local branch. She married fellow German George Retz in 1904 with whom she had 2 children. Retz and her husband did not become UK citizens when her brothers got theirs in 1908. As a result, at the start of the War in 1914 George Retz was interned in the Isle of Man until 1919. Retz ran butcher shops, one on the South Circular Road and one in Rathmines. There had been an incident at one of the properties where a mob attacked the shop at the start of the war. The shops get a mention by James Joyce in Ulysses. Activism There are few references to how Retz was connected to the Easter Rising but she may have been friends with Padraig Pearse. She was arrested and imprisoned with the other women in Richmond Barracks in 1916 and released at the same time on 8 May. She remained involved during the Irish War of Independence by arranging safe houses and medical treatment for the people on the run. Retz returned to Germany occasionally and in 1938 she was arrested for her part in an anti-Nazi rally in Berlin. Thanks to the intervention of the British embassy she was released after 14 days. She died in New York during May 1948 on her way to visit those family members who had emigrated to the United States. She is buried with family in California.

Three men were shot, one died and one of the survivors was Pete Taylor, father of Katie Taylor. Shooting At 6:55am a man walked into the Bray Boxing Club just before a class started and fired a number of shots, killing Bobby Messert, injuring Pete Taylor in the arm and chest and Ian Britton in the legs. There were 12 people in the gym including 1 minor at the time of the shooting. Katie Taylor had previously trained in the club, but was no longer involved and was in the United States at the time. Pete Taylor and the other survivor of the shooting were taken to St. Vincent's University Hospital after being shot. Gardai were looking for a silver coloured Volkswagen Caddy after examining CCTV. The van was thought to have travelled from Bray through Shankill, then abandoned on Pigeon House Road near Poolbeg Generating Station in Ringsend. Aftermath Pete Taylor spoke of his distress in the aftermath of the shooting both at the event and at the death of his close friend Bobby Messet, who had joined the gym in 2010. Petes' partner Karen Brown said on Instagram that she and Pete were relocating abroad after a \\"turbulent summer\\". The week following the shooting, Wicklow County Council took possession of the building. Katie Taylor issued a statement issuing condolences to the family of Bobby Messet and relief that her father had survived. She mentioned that she was estranged from her father and nothing to do with the club since 2015. She also criticised the media for the use of her name and image in stories relating to the shooting and asked the media to leave her and her family alone. Wicklow County Council had been pursuing Pete Taylor for ‚Ç¨9,533 unpaid rent the month before, which was revealed in a freedom of information request. The council believed that rent had not been paid since 2014. Pete Taylor rejected allegations that the club was in arrears over rent, saying there was a legitimate dispute over the amount owed and he criticised the council for changing locks on the club building.

They governed the area between 1325 and 1526, being preceded by the Karnat dynasty. Following the demise of the dynasty, there was a period of lawlessness in the region lasting around 30 years, after which emerged the dynasty of the Raj Darbhanga. Origins The rulers of the Oiniwar dynasty governed their lands between 1325 and 1526. They were Srotiya Maithil Brahmins whose first significant figure was Jayapati Thakur. His grandson, Nath Thakur, served the local kings of the Karnat dynasty and was rewarded with a grant of the village of Oini in recognition of his scholarship. As was then customary, he took the name of the granted place as his own and the dynasty that followed from him became known as the Oiniwar. There is an alternative theory that the family were generally considered to be significant scholars and that this reputation and the influence that flowed from it resulted in them being awarded the village of Sodapura, which later caused them also to be known as the Srotiyas. In 1325, following the collapse of the Karnat dynasty in 1324, Nath Thakur became the first Maithil ruler. The dynasty that followed from him comprised a further 20 rulers. Capitals The dynastic capitals were frequently relocated. At some unknown time, it was moved from Oini in present- day Muzaffarpur district to the village of Sugauna in modern-day Madhubani district, thus giving rise to the rulers also being known as the Sugauna Dynasty. It was moved again, to Devakuli, during the reign of Deva Singh, and then to Gajarathpura (also known as Shiva Singhpura) during the early years of the reign of his son, Shiva Singh. When the latter died in 1416, his queen, Lakshima, governed for 12 years and then was succeeded by his brother, Padma Singh, who moved the capital once more. Named Padma, after its founder, this was near to Rajnagar and a long way from the previous seat. Padma Singh, who ruled for three years, was succeeded by his wife, Vivasa Devi, and she, too, founded a new capital which is today the village of Vishual. Military The military of the Oiniwar dynasty was considered to be the main pillar of the King's power. The army was under the command of a senapati or the commander- in-chief who had a direct control of the military. The military had a four- fold structure with infantry, cavalry, elephants and chariots. The poet, Vidyapati who worked in the court of the Oiniwars, noted that the core of the army consisted of Rajputas and the vanguard consisted of mercenaries from Kurukshetra, Matsya, Surasena and Panchala. In a battle with a Muslim Sultan during the reign of King Sivasimha, many different warriors were mentioned including Commander Suraja, ≈öri ≈öakho Sanehi Jha, Pundamalla who was an expert in archery and Rajadeva (Raut) who was considered to be a matchless warrior. Culture The frequent moving of capitals and also the founding of new villages resulted in a range of new infrastructure financed by the dynasty, taking such forms as roads, temples, ponds and forts. In addition, the rulers were significant patrons of Maithili culture. Their era has been called the epitome of the Maithili language, with the contributions of the poet Vidyapati, who flourished during the reign of Shiva Singh, being particularly notable.A History Of Maithili Literature Vol.1, Mishra Jayakanta, 1949, Tirubhakti Publishers, Allahabad This was a significant change from the Karnat era, whose rulers were not native to the area and which had been culturally stagnant. Sugauna became the core of linguistic and philosophical development of the Hindu religion. Demise The last of the Oiniwar rulers was Laxminath Singh Deva.. He had been trying to assert himself as an independent ruler and in the process was killed by Nusrat Shah of Bengal The Wonder That Was India , S A A Rizvi , Picador India page 60 . Nusrat Shah Appointed his Brother in Law as the governor or Tirhut .Following Laxminath Singh Deva death there was a period of lawlessness in the region lasting around 30 years where various Rajput, Kayastha clans were battling for power. After this emerged the dynasty of the Raj Darbhanga. Rulers According to historian Makhan Jha, the rulers of the Oiniwar dynasty are as follows: * Nath Thakur * Atirupa Thakur * Vishwarupa Thakur * Govinda Thakur * Lakshman Thakur * Kameshwar Thakur * Bhogishwar Thakur, ruled for over 33 years * Ganeshwar Singh, reigned from 1355; killed by his cousins in 1371 after a long-running internecine dispute * Kirti Singh * Bhava Singh Deva * Deva Singh * Shiva Singh, killed in battle in 1416 * Lakshima, wife of Shiva Singh, ruled until her death in 1428 * Padma Singh, died in 1431 * Viswavasa Devi, wife of Padma Singh, died in 1443 * Hara Singh Deva, younger brother of Deva Singh * Nara Singh Deva, died in 1460 * Dhir Singh Deva * Bhairva Singh Deva, died in 1515, brother of Dhir Singh Deva * Rambhadra Deva * Laxminath Singh Deva, died in 1526 Jha also refers to the predecessors of Nath, Thakur used as \\"kings\\" but this contradicts his own explanation of when the family became rulers. Those predecessors are Jayapati Thakur and Hingu Thakur.

The seat became vacant after the resignation of the incumbent member Danyal Balagopal Abdullah, a member of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) and the governing Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition. This was the first federal by- election since the 9 May 2018 general election (GE14), which saw the first- ever change of federal government in Malaysia's history. Danyal Balagopal resigned his seat to pave a way for PKR leader Anwar Ibrahim to return to Parliament, it was dubbed as the 'PD Move'. Anwar was unable to contest the earlier GE14 due to his imprisonment on sodomy charges, which were widely accepted as politically motivated. He received a royal pardon after PH defeated the then-ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) and came into power, restoring his political rights and his eligibility to contest in elections. The Port Dickson parliamentary constituency had 75,770 registered voters in this by- election. 43% were Malays, 33% Chinese, 22% Indian and 2% other races. Anwar won the by-election with an increased majority, returning to Parliament for the first time in three years.  Nomination  The nomination day for the by- election was 29 September 2018. While PH confirmed early that it would field Anwar in the by-election, the oppositions did not announce its candidate until close to the nomination day. The Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) was initially expected not to contest the by-election and lend its support to the BN, like they did in the Sungai Kandis and Balakong by-elections. Criticisms were landed at PH for engineering the by-election too soon after the general election. BN politicians lambasted PH's move as an attempted coronation of Anwar. This was repudiated by prominent PH leaders such as Democratic Action Party (DAP) secretary-general and Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng. Lim said Anwar's return to Parliament was overdue and criticised BN's role in jailing Anwar when they were in government, thus preventing him to contest in the first place. A candidate from the United Malays National Organization (UMNO) was initially expected to contest for BN. Another BN component party, the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), announced that it would not contest the by- election for the coalition. The MIC said that their decision was a protest against UMNO's exclusion of their party from the candidacy consultations. They have previously contested the seat and its predecessor seat Telok Kemang for BN as recently as the 2018 federal elections. Another BN component party, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), also criticised UMNO's sidelining of other BN component parties and its cooperation with PAS. UMNO itself was divided on what approach it will be taking in the by-election. While most leaders were saying that the party would contest the seat, some prominent leaders were suggesting that the party should not contest and let Anwar win in a walkover. Several UMNO politicians were even planning to support Anwar, therefore bucking their party's official stance. The most notable politician in the last category was former Tourism Minister Nazri Aziz. BN ended up deciding not to contest, as a boycott and protest against the government's forcing of the by-election. To prevent the absence of opposition candidates, PAS moved to field their own candidate, a retired Lt Col ranked air force officer, Mohd Nazari Mokhtar. Close to the nomination day, the field became more crowded with the surprise entry of two independent candidates, namely Mohd Isa Abdul Samad the former Menteri Besar of Negeri Sembilan and Saiful Bukhari Azlan the former personal aide of Anwar who was also the accuser in his second sodomy trial. The other independent candidates contested were social media activist Stevie Chan Keng Leong, former lecturer Lau Seck Yan and management consultant Kan Chee Yuen. An eight and last independent candidate A. Rajendra who had filed his nomination papers, was disqualified because his proposer was not a registered voter in the constituency. Parti Rakyat Malaysia (PRM) originally stated that they would contest this by-election, but ended up not fielding a candidate. PRM eventually sacked its designated candidate, Ahmad Kamarudin, an ex-PKR member for withdrawing from the by-election claiming insufficient funds for the electoral deposit only at the eleventh hour.  Controversies  A voter in Port Dickson, Rosmadi Mohd Kassim filed a judicial review at the High Court on 27 September 2018, seeking the court to declare that the resignation of incumbent MP Danyal Balagopal Abdullah unconstitutional, thus rendering the move by Election Commission (EC) to hold the by-election as null and void. The High Court dismissed the application on 2 October 2018. Another Port Dickson voter, Noraziah Mohd Shariff filed on 28 September 2018 for a court declaration to invalidate the royal pardon received by Anwar on the grounds that it was a \\"full pardon\\" and not a \\"free pardon\\" under the Federal Constitution, which allows a former convict to contest. PAS hoped that the court would disqualify Anwar after he won and if their candidate finished second, he would instead be declared as the new constituency MP. EC chairman Azhar Azizan Harun affirmed the agency's stand that Anwar was free and eligible to contest and proceed in the by-election. The High Court dismissed the application finally when the applicant and her counsel failed to show up in court on 22 November 2018. Campaigning On 8 October 2018 Mahathir Mohamad broke a prime ministerial tradition by coming to Port Dickson to campaign in the by-election. He also spoke on the same stage with Anwar for the first time in twenty years. Some UMNO members defied their party's official boycott and supported Mohd Isa including his own son. The Indian-based political party Indian Progressive Front (IPF) expressed support for PAS in the by-election. The Negeri Sembilan Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (GERAKAN) announced their support for Anwar. Result Anwar won the Port Dickson by-election with 31,016 votes securing a 23,560-vote majority, with runner-up Mohd Nazari garnering 7,456 votes. =Result according to polling districts= PH won all polling districts and post and early votes.

Biscaye was employed by Williams Grand Prix Engineering on an intermittent basis at its kinetic energy recovery system research and development department and later helped in the design of the FW31's suspension. She travelled back to France after she could not get full-time employment with Williams and joined Venturi Automobiles in December 2009 as a research and development engineer and CAD designer on its sports car prototype programme. In early 2011, Biscaye was made project manager of the all-electric four-wheel drive Buckeye Bullet project and was later assigned to the Antarctica programme as a designer in July 2012. Venturi assigned her to its Formula E racing operation as logistics officer at the start of the 2015/16 season. Biscaye was appointed permanent team and logistics manager from the 2016/17 season. Her time in the position has seen Venturi establish partnerships with motorsports specialists HWA GmbH and car parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen. Early life and education Biscaye was raised in a small village in France. She is one of three children in her family and has two brothers. Biscaye came from a background where none of her family were neither involved nor interested in motor racing. She got interested in the industry through watching Formula One and rallying. During an interview with the lecturers of the Clermont-Ferrand-based mechanical engineering school French Institute of Advanced Mechanics (now SIGMA Clemont) in 2005, she was told a job in motor sport was not feasible since other interviewees had the same ambition and jobs in the industry were scarce. Biscaye said of the setback in a 2018 interview, \\"Looking back, I think that's what made me more determined ‚Äì because it was more difficult, I had a greater desire to succeed, so I worked very hard to prove that I could do it.\\" Nevertheless, she contacted several teams who competed in Formula One and the Le Mans Series. Biscaye later stopped her search when the Williams Grand Prix Engineering Formula One team agreed to employ her. She worked for the team for half a year in 2008 and returned for another four months in February 2009 after graduating from the French Institute of Advanced Mechanics with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. Williams later employed her as a contractor on a contractual basis until the end of the year. During her time at Williams, Biscaye worked in the team's design office to help develop its kinetic energy recovery system technology in their research and development department and then focused on the suspension for the FW31 chassis. She also had a placement at University of Canterbury as a post-doctorate assistant where she designed and tested a new rapid prototype system. Biscaye travelled back to France after she could not get Williams to employ her on a permanent basis when her contract ended and sought alternative work. Venturi Biscaye was employed by Venturi Automobiles in December 2009 as a research and development engineer and a computer aided designer on the company's sports car prototype programme. In her first years at Venturi, she also took a course in Sociology at the University of Strasbourg. In early 2011, Biscaye was made project manager of the fully-electric four-wheel drive Buckeye Bullet (VBB 3) vehicle. It is a joint programme established by Venturi with students of Ohio State University intended to establish new land speed records at the Bonneville Speedway in the U.S. state of Utah. From July 2012 until 2016, she was assigned to work in the Antarctica programme as a designer, an electric vehicle intended to provide scientists access to research zones considered to be un-reachable with internal combustion machinery. =Formula E= After working in these departments, Venturi assigned Biscaye to its FIA Formula E Championship racing operation as logistics officer and worked from its headquarters in Monaco at the start of the 2015/16 season.

These discoveries have allowed to recognise Gillis Claeissens as an important portraitist alongside Pieter Pourbus in 16th century Bruges.Anne van Oosterwijk, Tentoonstelling Pieter Pourbus en de vergeten meesters Life Gillis Claeissens was born in Bruges as the second son of Pieter Claeissens the Elder and Marie Meese. His father was a history painter and portraitist and his grandfather Alard Claeissens was also a painter. Gillis had three younger brothers of whom Antoon (1541/41-1613) and Pieter (c. 1535‚Äì1623) both became painters while a third brother Ambrosius was a master goldsmith. Triptych for de Kerchove family Gillis Claeissens was admitted as a master of the Guild of St Luke of Bruges on 18 October 1566. He remained in his father's workshop until 1570, while his brother Antoon joined that of Pieter Pourbus. Both Gillis and Antoon enjoyed the financial support of their father before they became artists recognized in their own right. Gillis Claeissens was an advisor to the Guild of St Luke of Bruges in the guild years 1570-1571, 1572-1573 and 1584-1585. He was the head of the Guild in the periods 1577-1578, 1581-1583 and 1604-1605. Claeissens married Elisabeth Boelandts sometime between 1576 and 1586. At the time of death of his wife in 1609 the couple was childless. The artist did have an illegitimate son called Gillis Claeissens the Younger who enrolled in the Guild of St. Luke of Brussels on 20 February 1601. Christ the Saviour adored by Abbot Robert Holman By 1589 Gillis Claeissens had moved to Brussels where he was nominated painter in title to the governor general of the Low Countries Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma. After Farnese died on 2 December 1592, Gillis returned to Bruges. Four years later he returned to Brussels to enter the service of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella. For the Brussels court he painted religious paintings as well as miniature portraits of the Archduchess. In 1596 Gillis resettled again in Bruges. Shortly before his death on 17 December 1605, Gillis Claeissens received a commission from the Bruges cathedral for the restoration of the high altarpiece of the church of Watervliet, near Bruges. Work Until recently the corpus of Gillis Claeissens' work included no unsigned paintings and therefore his role as an artist was overshadowed by the more voluminous output of his father and brother. Thanks to the discovery by art historian Brent Dewilde of a document published in Het Brugs Ommeland in 1983 a number of unsigned works can now be attributed to the artist. The document dated 13 February 1574 was a contract for the painting of a triptych painted for Claeys van de Kerchove and his family as an epitaph for the family tomb in the church of St Catherine in Assebroek. The panels of the triptych executed in 1576 are now in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest, where they are still attributed to Pieter Claeissens the Elder. The discovery has allowed to identify as the work of Gillis the portrait of Robert Holman (1571, Bruges seminary and the Christ the Saviour adored by Abbot Robert Holman (Sotheby's London sale of 4 July 2018, lot 6). It has also been possible to identify Gillis Claeissens with the Monogrammist GeC (for Gillis Egidius Claeissens) whose three portraits are now given to Gillis Claeissens (two paintings in the Hallwyl Museum, Stockholm and another recently at Weiss Gallery, London). Portrait of a lady Gillis Claeissens was a specialist portrait painter. He attracted for these works mainly commissions from noble patrons rather than the local bourgeoisie. He also painted religious compositions. A Crucifixion painted for the Archdukes Albert and Isabella is recorded.Gillis Claeissens, Christ the Saviour adored by Abbot Robert Holman at Sotheby's His portraits are typically of fairly modest dimensions. They are distinguished by their refined courtly style, which may have been indebted to French models. Unlike Pieter Pourbus who adhered to humanist principles in his portraits by portraying his sitters in different, active attitudes, Gillis depicted his sitters in similar frozen poses and devoted himself much more to the suggestion of richness in fabric expression and jewellery. He showed a painstaking attention to the rendering of the material of costumes and jewellery. His sitters are usually represented in static and frozen poses, with slightly enlarged eyes. Their rosy and smooth skin is shot through with fine white lines which express the reflection of the light. These characteristics are also seen in the works of his brothers Antoon and Pieter the Younger.

His grandfather Jan carried the name from the first de Lange who emigrated from Germany. He married Christine in the middle of 1953. She is from the Marais family and received her name from the Roux / Belling ancestors. He had two sisters, one Lucelle who died before him. He died in Pretoria on 9 April 2019. He attended Aberdeen High School in Aberdeen and Gill College in Somerset East. De Lange studied at the University of Pretoria, obtaining BA (law) and BEd. After graduating from the University of South Africa with a BA, he obtained a MEd and PhD at the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit. Working life He was Vice-Rector at Goudstad College of Education, in Johannesburg (1967-1968) and Rector of the Potchefstroom College of Education (1969), in Potchefstroom. Both these institutions do not exist today after the rationalisation under the then-Minister of Education Kadar Asmal. In 1979 he became Rector of the Randse Afrikaanse Universiteit. He held this position until 1979. After his academic career, he became chairman of the HSRC Board from 1988 to 1995. Broederbond He was chairman of the Afrikaner Broederbond, a white, male Afrikaner secret organization from 1984 until 1994, when Tom de Beer took over from him. Involvement through his career De Lange had been involved in the education system in South Africa. He has been at the head of educational colleges in Potchefstroom and Johannesburg. He has also been the rector of a university. In August 1980, the government instructed the HSRC to conduct an investigation into all levels of education, with Professor de Lange being the chairman. His report was issued in July 1981. The main conclusion from his report is that all education should be equal, irrespective of race, and a single ministry should handle it. As leader of the Afrikaner Broederbond, he played a role in the negotiated settlement reached in South Africa in 1994. In 1985, de Lange realised that change needed to take place regarding the Apartheid system. The National Party government did not talk openly with the ANC, and it was then still banned. On 8 June 1986, de Lange and Thabo Mbeki (from the ANC) met in New York for a meeting. The meeting's duration was 5 hours. After this meeting, other events followed, which were attended by like-minded people. For example one such event was the Dakar Conference. He also made statements that showed that the Afrikaner Broederbond was in agreement that the politics in South Africa should change. De Lange issued a discussion document to all members in which he stated that a negotiated settlement with a full democracy was the only way out.

The most accepted solution to this problem is the elbow method. It consists of running k-means clustering to the data set with a range of values, calculating the sum of squared errors for each, and plotting them in a line chart. If the chart looks like an arm, the best value of k will be on the \\"elbow\\". Another method that modifies the k-means algorithm for automatically choosing the optimal number of clusters is the G-means algorithm. It was developed from the hypothesis that a subset of the data follows a Gaussian distribution. Thus, k is increased until each k-means center's data is Gaussian. This algorithm only requires the standard statistical significance level as a parameter and does not set limits for the covariance of the data.https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2526-learning-the-k-in-k-means.pdf  Connectivity-based (Hierarchical clustering)  Connectivity-based clustering or hierarchical clustering is based on the idea that objects have more similarities to other nearby objects than to those further away. Therefore, the generated clusters from this type of algorithm will be the result of the distance between the analyzed objects. Hierarchical models can either be divisive, where partitions are built from the entire data set available, or agglomerating, where each partition begins with a single object and additional objects are added to the set. Although hierarchical clustering has the advantage of allowing any valid metric to be used as the defined distance, it is sensitive to noise and fluctuations in the data set and is more difficult to automate. Methods have been developed to improve and automate existing hierarchical clustering algorithmshttps://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19123336.pdf such as an automated version of single linkage hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). This computerized method bases its success on a self-consistent outlier reduction approach followed by the building of a descriptive function which permits defining natural clusters. Discarded objects can also be assigned to these clusters. Essentially, one needs not to resort to external parameters to identify natural clusters. Information gathered from HCA, automated and reliable, can be resumed in a dendrogram with the number of natural clusters and the corresponding separation, an option not found in classical HCA. This method includes the two following steps: outliers being removed (this is applied in many filtering applications) and an optional classification allowing expanding clusters with the whole set of objects. BIRCH (balanced iterative reducing and clustering using hierarchies) is an algorithm used to perform connectivity-based clustering for large data-sets. It is regarded as one of the fastest clustering algorithms, but it is limited its requirement of the number of clusters as input. Therefore, new algorithms based on BIRCH have been developed in which there is no need to provide the cluster count from the beginning, but that preserves the quality and speed of the clusters. The main modification is to remove the final step of BIRCH, where the user had to input the cluster count, and to improve the rest of the algorithm, referred to as tree-BIRCH, by optimizing a threshold parameter from the data. In this resulting algorithm, the threshold parameter is calculated from the maximum cluster radius and the minimum distance between clusters, which are often known. This method proved to be efficient for data sets of tens of thousands of clusters. If going beyond that amount, a supercluster splitting problem is introduced. For this, other algorithms have been developed, like MDB-BIRCH, which reduces super cluster splitting with relatively high speed.  Density- based  Unlike partitioning and hierarchical methods, density-based clustering algorithms are able to find clusters of any arbitrary shape, not only spheres. The density-based clustering algorithm uses autonomous machine learning that identifies patterns regarding geographical location and distance to a particular number of neighbors. It is considered autonomous because a priori knowledge on what is a cluster is not required. This type of algorithm provides different methods to find clusters in the data. The fastest method is DBSCAN, which uses a defined distance to differentiate between dense groups of information and sparser noise. Moreover, HDBSCAN can self-adjust by using a range of distances instead of a specified one. Lastly, the method OPTICS creates a reachability plot based on the distance from neighboring features to separate noise from clusters of varying density. These methods still require the user to provide the cluster center and cannot be considered automatic. The Automatic Local Density Clustering Algorithm (ALDC) is an example of the new research focused on developing automatic density-based clustering. ALDC works out local density and distance deviation of every point, thus expanding the difference between the potential cluster center and other points. This expansion allows the machine to work automatically. The machine identifies cluster centers and assigns the points that are left by their closest neighbor of higher density. In the automation of data density to identify clusters, research has also been focused on artificially generating the algorithms. For instance, the Estimation of Distribution Algorithms guarantees the generation of valid algorithms by the directed acyclic graph (DAG), in which nodes represent procedures (building block) and edges represent possible execution sequences between two nodes. Building Blocks determine the EDA's alphabet or, in other words, any generated algorithm. Clustering algorithms artificially generated are compared to DBSCAN, a manual algorithm, in experimental results.

His career spanned 30 years, starting from the early 1960s ‚Äì making him one of the first prominent Assyrian singers to produce records and sing onstage, alongside Evin Agassi ‚Äì up until the late 1980s. He innovated a new style of Assyrian music, which was a blend of keyboard instruments, guitars and drums. Biography Edward Yousif started to sing in both Assyrian and Iraqi gatherings from the age of 11. In his inception, he only sung in Arabic, imitating his idol Farid Al Atrash, a famous Syrian-Egyptian singer. Influenced by Assyrian singer Oshana Youel Mirza, Biba ultimately began to sing in the Assyrian language in 1961 on stage, where he became an instant sensation and adopted his stage name \\"Biba\\". A pioneer of his kind, he and musician George Ishu endeavored to bring to life a new type of music sound, stating, \\"We did not want to imitate Western music...We wanted to continue in the path of Eastern music, but possess a new sound, provide a new dimension\\". In 1965, the president of Iraq Abdul Salam Arif congratulated Biba with a gold watch in honor of him winning a singing competition on television. From 1962 to 1979, Biba made frequent appearances on Iraqi television. In the 1980s, Biba produced his first studio albums, and continued singing in concert parties and weddings until the early 1990s, before he became ill with alcoholic liver disease, and eventually succumbing to his illness in 1995. Late Biba resided in Chicago with his wife and daughter Krystal. He is laid to rest in Montrose Cemetery in Chicago. Legacy Other Iraqi ethnic groups, such as the Arabs, Kurds, and Turkmens admired his songs, buying his merchandise. His 1962 live recording of song, Qurba Al Aynati' (\\"Close to m My Eyes\\"), became a hit for its lyrics, fresh melody, and the fact that it was an expression on Biba's life experience, such as his first love. In a time frame of six months in 1962, Biba sold over 5,600 records in Iraq and 12,000 were subsequently produced and sold in Iran. In present times, his 1960s songs Mokhibee Sogul (\\"Dearly Beloved\\") and Saperchewin (\\"I'm a Wanderer\\") are extant in spirit and considered classics, and would remain to be one of the most covered ballads on stage, which are usually performed in weddings and would accompany slow dances.

It is usually measured over periods of one-half or full years and is often reported as a percentage growth compared to the previous year or period. Top-line growth does not accrue across periods, instead it is recalculated based on the performance of the business in a specified reporting period. It is a gross figure that represents economic inflows to the company, prior to the deduction of expenses or changes in equity contributed by the business owners or the investors. Top-line growth is often used as a metric for business growth potential and overall operating performance. In most businesses, it forms an integral part of their strategic planning and a means of assessments for such strategies.  Calculation  Businesses calculate the top-line growth figure using official financial statements, which must adhere to the appropriate accounting standards for the country that the business operates in. = Using financial statements = The statement of profit and loss, also known as the income statement, for the specific period contains a gross-revenue figure which is located at the beginning of the statement. Expenses are then deducted on the statement to derive the \\"bottom-line\\" figure which is a net value. To make top-line growth comparable across periods, a business may use a percentage-change formula to see the amount of growth or decline in the top-line figure. = Modelling top- line growth = This figure can be modelled into trend lines and graphed. The graphs regarding top-line growth are often then reported to shareholders, or potential creditors, to show the pace of growth or expansion for new and existing businesses. These revenue models (RMs) are influenced by the industry the business operates in, the product it provides and the business environment at the time. RMs are useful to businesses when predicting top-line growth, because they present a forecast of future sales that the business can incorporate into its present and future business strategies. The rate is used to determine business performance and predict future performance. = Relationship to bottom-line growth = Top-line growth is sometimes thought to be exclusive of bottom-line growth (also referred to as net income), as an increase of gross revenue or general economic inflows to the business is usually associated with greater output and operating expenses, which would decrease the net-figure bottom-line growth at a proportionate rate. Despite the issue of increasing expenses, neoclassical theories link bottom-line growth or profitability with top-line revenue growth. In the past, theorists have determined that sales growth is a function of the rate of profit in an accessible market that contains no restrictions on output. Under these conditions, bottom-line growth is seen to be influencing a business's capital structure decisions. A business is thought to be more likely to invest in projects that drive sales and top-line growth, rather than to save the money in retained earnings. = Managerial limitations = While useful to business managers, top-line growth is not used in isolation, as it does not indicate how efficient a business is. An inefficient business can generate many unnecessary expenses and costs which could prevent the company from becoming profitable, but it could still potentially report a positive top-line growth figure. The chief sales officer (CSO) of a company is responsible for mediating between factors of growth and expense. The CSO is tasked with the role of motivating the salespeople, creating enjoyable experiences for the customer through efficient business procedures, and capitalising on new growth opportunities. The CSO must answer to the shareholders of their company when reporting on the performance of growth strategies.  Business Lifecycle  Trends in top-line growth can emerge depending on the stage in a business's life cycle. It is known that there are typically four stages in the life of a business: establishment, early growth, later growth, and post-maturity. Throughout this life cycle, businesses can face varying challenges in achieving top-line growth. In the establishment period a business may struggle to grow their top-line due to an unestablished customer base which can prevent extensive sales growth. The early-growth stage can see large top-line growth as the business may have developed a growing network of customers. During the later-growth stage, the business may see their top-line growth slow down or stop as the business has grown and expansion strategies plateau. New products may be introduced in this phase, to continue top-line growth. During the final stage, the most stable, the business relies on its established network and assets to maintain a healthy and maintainable top-line growth figure. = Small Business Revenue = Small businesses have historically experienced greater operational risk and more varied levels of top-line revenue growth. Some small businesses can experience more volatility due to their smaller customer base and limited revenue streams. The top-line growth of these businesses can be greatly impacted by broader economic conditions, as a small change in customer base can represent a large proportion of future revenue. Sustained top-line growth for a small business can signal business expansion, increased size, and profitability.  Practical business applications  Businesses use the top-line growth rate to inform their decision-making regarding cost-cutting and sales techniques. Managers will analyse the top- line growth rate to gain insight into how everyday business operations are performing. If they do not meet predetermined targets set by the business, new strategies for increased growth‚Äîhigher sales turnover, and pricing‚Äîmay be considered to improve the trend. = Goal-setting = Traditionally, companies will tend to set growth (top-line) and cost-cutting (bottom-line) targets simultaneously to make sure they optimise their profit margins and maximise the economic benefit of their revenue growth. Growth can bring extra costs, so businesses emphasize cost-cutting to capture the benefits of top-line growth. Businesses often report their top-line growth to shareholders when they have recently implemented a growth strategy to determine if it has been successful. = Top-line growth as a key performance indicator = Performance management is popular among public and private businesses. Some managers view key performance indicators (KPIs) as a way to increase the effectiveness of their management strategies. KPIs are predetermined, interrelated targets given to members of staff, to help them in achieving the broader objectives of the business. Companies can align these goals with critical success factors (CSFs). CSFs are procedures implemented to improve sales during operations. A company's reliance on CSFs can be determined by sudden dips in top-line revenue growth and help a business achieve its KPIs. A KPI of increased sales can be implemented to achieve the business goal of top-line revenue growth. Such KPIs allow the manager to measure business progress at an incremental level to allow for assessment and change in moving forward.  Strategies  Over time, many popular theories regarding top-line growth strategies have emerged, each reflecting the popular business attitudes of their respective eras. Two main schools of thought have been identified: expansion into emerging markets and meeting unmet consumer demand in developed countries. Businesses can use a combination of these strategies to make their revenue streams more diversified and therefore achieve a more sustainable top-line growth trend. A diversified growth strategy is popular, and businesses believe it will protect them in times of economic collapse or radical innovation in the marketplace. Incremental top-line growth can be achieved using sales tactics or through seasonal demand, but businesses do not see this as a sustainable way to maintain a positive top-line growth trend. = Expansion into emerging markets = The strategy of expansion into emerging markets was popular during the 1980s due to globalisation, the Westernisation of many countries, and developments in technology. This strategy is considered the traditional approach to top-line growth and infers that a global expansion is necessary to grow the top-line exponentially. Statistically, the top 500 non- financial companies in the US have historically improved their top-line growth by expanding into emerging markets to capture sales momentum above the GDP growth of developed nations. This strategy to improve top-line growth is mostly applicable to businesses with large capital budgets and the extensive infrastructure in place to facilitate a physical or online global expansion. This approach to top-line growth is usually adopted by companies who are not already operating in many locations, as they then have room left to expand into. This strategy can be viewed as less helpful for large global companies who have already dominated emerging markets, or perhaps sell a product that generates no demand in emerging markets. = Meeting unmet consumer demand = In contrast, a recent strategy is that for businesses to sustain high top-line growth in a globalised economy they should invest in research and development leading to innovation to target unmet consumer demand in their established markets, instead of investing to establish new markets in emerging economies. Increased competition domestically and overseas forces businesses to capture top-line growth by capitalising on a shift in consumer behaviour or preferences. Businesses can invest in research activities and data analytics through loyalty programs to gain market insights or identify trends and the increased demand resulting from such trends. = Innovation approach = A strategy closely linked to \\"meeting unmet consumer demand\\", innovation requires the development of new products and services that will be cutting- edge and face no established competitors in the marketplace. Managers face the challenge of enacting new creative business models and preserving established revenue streams that are essential to maintaining the top-line revenue. For these managers, human resources are key, as they can contribute to conceptualising new business ideas and executing them effectively. An innovation approach to top-line growth is said to be most suited to established businesses with large capital expenditure capacities, due to the large amount of research and development costs incurred. = Consumer- behaviour approach = The consumer-behaviour approach to sustaining or increasing top-line growth focuses on establishing a unique point of customer service to meet the unmet demands of consumers in established markets. By analysing the needs, wants, and psychological motivations of the consumer, businesses can tailor their marketing and product offerings to increase sales. The chief marketing officer (CMO) will create a strategy to capture consumers in all revenue streams. These streams consist of the acquisition of new customers, extra sales from previous customers, and returning business of old customers, all of which can theoretically increase the top-line growth of a company.  Top-line growth for nonprofit entities  Top-line growth is also measured by entities that do not operate purely for profit. Such entities include nonprofit (NPO), such as non-government (NGO) and charitable organisations. These entities do not operate to deliver high returns to shareholders; instead they aim to service the community and achieve their \\"mission\\". Among NPOs, top-line growth is a tool to implement their services rather than an end goal, due to their charitable nature. = Sources of top- line growth for non-profit organisations = NPOs engage in revenue-seeking behaviour by establishing government subsidies, corporate donations and partnerships, and private donations. The strategies to grow their top-line revenue are unique, as NPOs rely on external bodies to fund their operations. Business-relationship management and marketing are strategies commonly used by NPOs to achieve these goals. = Top-line growth uncertainty = The operations of NPOs rely on income from major donors. If this top-line revenue growth is uncertain, managers can view the future of the NPO as uncertain. NPOs have reported instances where concerns of revenue growth have become the primary function of the business and undermined their mission.

He was the last governor of the French colony of Saint-Christophe on the West Indian island now called Saint Kitts. After he surrendered the island to the English during the War of the Spanish Succession he was tried and found guilty of cowardice. He died before his appeal to this verdict could be heard. He was also an inventor, and among other devices invented a power loom driven by a mill wheel. Family and early years (1656‚Äì91) Jean-Baptiste de Gennes was born around 1656 in Gu√©rande, Loire-Atlantique. His father was Jean du Boisguy de Gennes, seigneur de Bourg Chevreuil. His mother was Anne Naudin du Vieux- Pont. He came from an old noble family of Brittany that had fallen into great poverty. To maintain the family his father \\"exercised a mechanical art that is a necessary part of medicine.\\" Louis Victor de Rochechouart de Mortemart, when visiting Brittany, was struck by the spirit and ability of the young Gennes and took him to Messina. He then made him enter the navy, where he served with distinction and became known to Jean-Baptiste Colbert and then to Louis and J√©r√¥me Ph√©lypeaux, secretaries of state for the navy, who employed him on various dangerous missions. Gennes married twice. He had two or three daughters from the first marriage. His second marriage was to the daughter of a rich merchant of La Rochelle named Savouret. His marriage to Marie Savouret took place on 1 June 1690. They had two children, Jean Guillaume and Anne Henriette. His son also joined the navy. Naval captain (1691‚Äì98) Gor√©e island, 17th century Port Galant, Strait of Magellan Gennes was made chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis. He was appointed capitaine de vaisseau (ship-of- the-line captain) in 1691, aged about 35. In 1695 Gennes was given command of a squadron of the king's navy armed by some private individuals who had obtained permission to make an establishment in the Strait of Magellan, or near there in the north or south sea. Gennes left La Rochelle on 3 June 1695 in command of a fleet of five vessels, the largest being the Faucon (46) and the Soleil d'Afrique (32). The fleet was at Gor√©e off what is now Senegal from 3‚Äì19 July 1695, and in the Gambia River from 22 July to 24 August 1695, where the French captured Fort James on what is now Kunta Kinteh Island from the English. Gennes loaded two vessels with the captured Africans he found in the English base and dispatched them to the French islands of the Antilles. This prize covered all the costs of the armament. Contrary winds forced the rest of the fleet back to Gor√©e on 5 September 1695. From there they sailed to the Cape Verde Islands, to Saint Anne Island on the coast of Brazil and then to Rio de Janeiro, which they reached on 2 December and left on 26 December 1695. The fleet sailed down the coast of Patagonia in January 1696. They entered the Strait on 11 February 1696 and reached Port Galant, but were forced to return and reentered the Atlantic on 11 April 1696. Gennes blamed the captain of the S√©ditieux for the failure to reach the Pacific. Although expedition was unable to pass through to the Pacific due to the extreme cold and poor weather, it made a number of observations of the land and inhabitants of the region. On 16 April 1696 the squadron was separated by fog. Gennes returned to Rio de Janeiro on 20 May. He rejoined the Soleil d'Afrique and S√©ditieux (26) on 18 July 1696 in Bahia. The squadron reached Cayenne on 31 August 1696, left the next month to cruise around Barbados, and visited Martinique, Saint Lucia and Guadeloupe. Gennes sailed from Guadeloupe on 11 February 1697. He returned to La Rochelle on 21 April 1697. Gennes was granted considerable pensions for himself and his family, was given a large grant of land named Oyac on the mainland of Cayenne, and was elevated by the king to become the count of Oyac. Governor of Saint-Christophe (1698‚Äì1702) From 1668 to 1688 the French and English colonists on Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) had been at peace. However, when the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) broke out the governor general of the Antilles, Charles de Courbon de Bl√©nac, decided that to ensure the safety of the French on the island he must expel the English. At the start of 1689 he attacked and defeated the English, and transported them to Jamaica, Barbados and other islands. The English returned to Saint Christopher with large forces in August 1690. After a month and a half the French were obliged to capitulate and cede the whole island to the English. The Treaty of Ryswick (1697) ended the Nine Years' War and returned the French part of the island. Before handing over in 1699 the English systematically destroyed the plantations and buildings, including four of the five churches. When the French regained control there were no functioning sugar plantations or boiling houses, and only 1,166 inhabitants. Gennes was given command of Saint Christophe in the absence of Commander Charles de Pechpeyrou-Comminges de Guitaut, nominal governor of the island and now second in command of the French Antilles. Under Gennes the French began reconstruction, but the effort was wasted. During the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1713) the English on Saint Christophe did not wait for confirmation of the start of war before starting to harass the French. They were aware of the weakness of the French colony and lack of support it could expect from other islands. Gennes knew the English were preparing to attack, but only had about 400 militia to oppose them, plus four companies of marine troops. He proposed that the English observe the old tradition of neutrality on the island, but the English led by Christopher Codrington as general of the English Leeward Islands disagreed. Codrington came to Saint Christopher from Antigua. He brought a regiment of regular troops from Antigua, combined with militia of Antigua and Nevis, for a total of almost 1,200 men. With their local forces the English had more than 2,100 men. On 15 July 1702 four English men of war and about twenty barques appeared off Nevis point and a French refugee arrived with a message from major general Sir Walter Hamilton that called on Gennes to cede the French part of Saint Christopher. Saint Christophers Island in 1729. Before the capitulation the French held the southeast and northwest parts, and the English the center. Gennes called a council of war in which 12 of the 17 members advised surrender. Gennes therefore composed and signed articles of capitulation and sent them to Major General Hamilton. The French forces were to be allowed to leave with drums beating, and the officers would keep their arms. The captains could take six slaves, the lieutenants four and the ensigns two. The members of the sovereign council of the island could each take six slaves, and the other inhabitants could each take one. The families of all the colonists and officers were to be taken to Martinique with their baggage. The Irish who had settled in the French part of the island were to be allowed to keep their arms and property. The capitulation was signed by both sides on 16 July 1702. Most of the colonists went to Martinique or Guadeloupe, although some were taken to Saint-Domingue (Haiti) . Last years (1705‚Äì05) Gennes was held in Saint Christophe until the French evacuation was complete, then chartered a small boat to take him to his estate in Cayenne with the slaves the English had allowed him and some others he had bought. He was captured by a Dutch corsair and taken to Saint Thomas, Barbados. He was returned to Martinique around August 1703. The governor general Charles-Fran√ßois de Machault de Belmont seems to have been instructed by the court to prosecute the Comte de Gennes in such a way as not to besmirch his honour unless he was found guilty of excessive cowardice. When he reached Martinique Gennes was arrested and taken to Fort Saint Pierre, and a Major Coullet was told to start investigating his case and that of his lieutenants. Everyone interviewed recalled that Saint Christophe had been considered indefensible, and that Commander Guitaut (now dead) and the intendant had planned to send boats to transport its inhabitants to other islands. However, the prosecution seems to have been directed to find a culprit. Gennes was tried in August 1704, found guilty of cowardice and condemned to be degraded from the nobility and stripped of all his title and positions. Gennes appealed the decision. A few days later the king's ship Th√©tis arrived at Fort Royal to transport Gennes to France. He was captured by the English and taken to Plymouth, England, where he died before he could defend himself in France. He died in 1705. Inventor Gennes had great mathematical ability, was very interested in mechanics, and invented several interesting and useful machines. His inventions included cannons and mortars, fire arrows to burn the sails of ships and a clock without a spring or counterweight. He made a peacock of iron and ivory that swallowed food, and was said to digest it by fermentation and then show the results. In 1678 Gennes presented a weaving machine that did not require workers to the Acad√©mie Royale. The machine was a power loom, where the movement of a mill replaced all the normal movements of a human weaver. Legacy Manoir de Bourgchevreuil The king treated the 1704 trial as if de Gennes had not been found guilty, and his titles were retained and a pension paid to his widow. By an act of 12 June 1625 his son Jean de Gennes du Boisguy, a reformed Protestant, purchased the manor house and estate of Bourgchevreuil. He purchased several additional neighboring lands to enlarge the estate. On his death, after his son lost his fortune the estate became the property of his two daughters, Catherine and Marie. Around 1640 his daughter Catherine de Gennes (died 1680) married Jacques de Farcy, seigneur de la Ville du bois, sieur de Painel (died 1682). His daughter Marie de Gennes married Jacques' brother Ren√© de Farcy, seigneur de la Daguerie.

The impact of Portuguese colonial control over Angola has left a large architectural legacy in the country. However, present-day Angola is increasingly influenced by broader global trends in architecture, especially as a result of the country's oil-boom in the early 21st Century.  The unique and distinctive architectural style of Angola‚Äôs cinemas  Cinema in Mo√ß√¢medesAlthough the film making industry in Angola has never been famous, by 1975 there were 50 cinemas in the country. Cinemas can be considered landmark buildings in some countries and cultures. Although the film itself may be the only important element in many cultures, there are many African countries that realize the cinemas themselves, the actual structures, are also meaningful. Since the end of the war in 2002, when the oil boom broke out, the redevelopment and reconstruction of Angola has been a subject of rising praise and lamentation for Africa. However, cultural space and historical heritage have not been well developed in general. The Goethe-Institut in Angola wants to restore the National Cinema, and they are researching prominent cinemas. The aim of the campaign is to protect Angolan cinemas, which can be regarded as national cultural heritage buildings, and being modern, they attract foreign visitors. The campaign began with a resumption of free fiction in the form of a photo coffee table book by Walter Fernandes and Miguel Hurst. With this, Angola has found a new development point for the appreciation of cinema. The architects Maria Alice Correia, F. Joao Guimaraes, and Paula Nascimento. The design of Cine-esplanda has opened up a new chapter for cinema in Angola. Nascimento believes restoring the functional mode of cinema is just as important as restoring architectural form. In order to best represent the developed world of the film industry, some theater operators use stock images from Film Atlantico taken at the Luanda International Film Festival, or the film Cazenga Movie Renovation of ‚ÄúAssaults in Luanda II‚Äù in 2008, producing a kind of musseques cinema. Compared with a vivid exhibition, this genre of cinema is dull. Of course, sometimes absence also exists in film. The Musseques Cinema was the largest functional cinema in the late colonial period, and now the building is used for the post-independence parliament. The Musseques Cinema employed a narrow range of project operations, political and economic power, existing to a large extent as members of the MPLA]. Images, symbols, and colours appear in some photographs to show that film space is more often used by political committees than for cultural purposes or to hold public meetings. However, there will never be a lack of film space. The comments of Angola celebrity, Jose Mena, Abrantes on Angolan films also apply to cinemas, whose \\"past deserves a better present\\"  Angola‚Äôs housing  When the civil war ended in Angola, President Jose Eduardo DOS Santos Angola built one million homes. Because most of the country's houses were destroyed due to the long civil war, the people at that time had serious housing shortages. A total of 100,000 hectares of land near Luanda, Benguela, Namibe, Lubango and Malange were planned for housing, and the projects were mostly contracted by Chinese companies. Kilamba is a superstar city with 710 buildings and 20,000 apartments built in September 2012. In the first stage, 28 urban blocks were built. The northeast of North Luanda provides accommodation for nearly thirty thousand people. In 2009, the Housing Development Fund was set up by the Angolan government to help provide low-income families with social housing. However, FFH investments are targeted only at government workers in national housing projects, such as in the new city of Kiramba. The loan is extended for 30 years at a rate of 3%. To help more people, in 2013 the government introduced a subsidized rent-buy program for people with jobs and national citizenship through Sonangol Imobiliaria e-owned (SONIP), a real estate company owned by the state oil company. At the very beginning, apartments in these projects were priced between $125 thousand and $200 thousand. However, these housing programs do not really address the cost of living because most of these housing projects are far from the city. Public transport is not very developed, which means that many residents rely on expensive private transport. [6] Although the government still gives priority to state-funded housing construction, budget constraints caused by the global economic recession continue to limit the government's ability to invest its own resources for the development of housing. In order to raise funds to continue the government's housing programme, the State established the Housing Development Assets Fund (FADEH). These initiatives, as well as promotion for public-private partnerships and the task force set up to enhance private sector participation in the national urbanism implementation and housing provision, mark opportunities for housing financiers and users along supply chain for housing. Future legal changes in the field of land and property should promote private sector investment and generate taxes that can be used to improve the housing sector. So far, housing finance and development initiatives have barely affected the lower-income segments of the population, despite the existence of the housing development fund and the legislative system governing cooperatives and microfinance institutions. In addition, most of the initiatives are limited to the capital and major urban areas of the country. The best practices developed by Kixicredit and other old companies provide opportunities for building and further expansion.  Churches in Angola  Between 1641 and 1648, Bengo, a national monument, was built. This shrine for mutineers offers housing for thousands of pilgrims, specifically at the time of the mutineers' feast, in September. Benguela has several churches such as the Popovite church, whose baroque style is listed as a national monument. The building has a nave, two corridors, a chapel, two towers, baptistery and a choir. It also boasts 1748 stained glass windows. On the inside, is Brazilian wood carving and the pulpit, which is done in a rococo style, that is found only in Angola. In 2009, the church accepted stained glass that had been on display for more than four years. The province of Cabinda has some of the strongest religious beliefs in Angola. Within the province, there is the old episcopal cathedral of the 16th century. Additionally, this is where the Church of the Lang Dana (21st century), the Church of the World's Queen, the Church of the Unsullied Conception, the Chapel of Choa, the Church of Mbomka, and the Church of St. Anthony can be found. The Church of St. Tiago is on the hilltop that controls the village of Randana. Gothic revival plans classified this church by colonial rule as \\"property of the public interest‚Äù. In the northern province of Kwanza, North Kwanza is the location of the Virgin of Victory church. In several such churches and chapels, the viaduct leads to the other church, which is rock- solid and tiled. It is rich in ornaments and has a famous reputation and a good image. The latter supported by powerful buttresses and spectacular bell towers from 1938 and still stand even today. Angola's first governor was buried there in 1589. Rebuilt in the 17th century, it has been a national monument since 1923. In South Kwanza, the Church of St. Kangba in the southern Guanza province, replaced by Serra and then later by Waco Kungo, is almost a faithful replica of the church of St. Kangba, built in Portugal 200 years ago. Despite the significant damage to the attic and the exterior walls caused by the civil war, the buildings have been properly restored. Additionally, Sambis and Porto Ambohm also still stand. [7] Next to the Rock of the Angel, Sambis and Porto Ambohm can be traced back to the eighteenth-Century San Joseph Church. Santa Rita of Cassia, the largest refuge in Angola, was opened in April 2013. In Mbanza, Congo is one of Zaire's largest cultural assets and is now the Cathedral of Kurbibi. Between May 6, and July 6th, 1941, construction began on the Kula Bibi church. Because of its rare architectural form, the site has attracted the interest of experts at home and abroad. Angola claims it is the oldest church which shows the history progress of the Angola in Sub- Saharan Africa. It was promoted to a cathedral in 1596, and in 1992 Pope John Poulos visited it.

He was selected as a retinue from Han to Hun and later served the Xiongnu emperor Laoshang Shanyu. Zhonghang Yue raised a series of theories for the international relations between Han and Xiongnu, which imposed great influence on the political practices of Xiongnu.  Background  Zhonghang Yue lived during the Han dynasty, which had a complex relationship with its neighbor, Xiongnu, a tribal confederation inhabiting the eastern Eurasian Steppe. There were conflicts between the two regimes, as they confronted each other in several wars over resources and frontier issues. Policies maintained temporary peace. Heqin, a foreign policy of marriage alliance, was introduced by the Han following the defeat of their imperial army in 200 BC. The heqin policy created a marriage-based alliance by marrying Chinese princesses to Xiongnu rulers. Usually, intermarriages came with valuable presents, resources and other agreements (e.g.: opening of checkpoints), which were considered beneficial to Xiongnu. During the process of heqin, the Han would send a messenger to accomplish the mission of escorting the princess and delivering peaceful messages to Xiongnu.  Collaboration  The Han history Records of the Grand Historian (Chinese: Shiji) provides evidence that Zhonghang Yue had made efforts to break the marriage-based peace between Han and Xiongnu. Because the domestic political environment was unsteady in Han, Emperor Wen of Han thought that Han was not ready for another war against Xiongnu. Wen decided to use heqin marriage to appease Xiongnu and establish friendly relations. He selected Zhonghang Yue to act as the messenger to accompany the princess to Xiongnu. Zhonghang Yue was opposed to this, and stated, \\"If I had to go, I will be the future enemy of Han\\". When Zhonghang Yue arrived among the Xiongnu, he immediately changed his allegiances. He suggested that the Shanyu (the Xiongnu ruler) demonstrate that Xiongnu was stronger than Han by looking down upon the Han gifts. For example, Xiongnu horse-riders could show that Han fabrics were inferior to Xiongnu fur, as the fabric becomes shredded when crossing forests. He suggested that Han food should be thrown away to show it is inferior to Xiongnu food. Zhonghang Yue also showed his attitude through an argument with the Han ambassador. The Han ambassador once said that Xiongnu had the tradition of disregarding their elderly. Zhonghang Yue countered that the elderly from Han offered their food and clothes for the army, and that since the Xiongnu regime was based on military strength and the elderly were unable to fight, it was rational to give better resources to the strong youngsters to maximize benefits, so that both generations could survive. Zhonghang Yue persuaded the Shanyu to invade. In 166 BC, Xiongnu invaded Han. Xiongnu soldiers captured thousands of peasants and livestock. The invasion began continuous war between Han and Xiongnu, which lasted until another heqin took place.  Ideologies  Zhonghang Yue argued that, rather than being inferior to Han culture, Xiongnu culture and traditions were better. One of the most important ideologies of Zhonghang Yue was anti-Chinese localization. Zhonghang Yue asked the Shanyu to use a bigger board, stamp and sealing mud that the Han emperor to write his reply. He also used an arrogant tone in the greeting of the reply to show the power of Xiongnu. Zhonghang Yue once said: \\"the total population of Xiongnu is less than a province in Han. However, the differences between Han and Xiongnu are the reason that Xiongnu is powerful. Thus, there is no need for Xiongnu and its people to be dependent on Han.\\" Zhonghang Yue showed his attitude of encouraging ethnic independence of Xiongnu and separation from Han in this dialogue. When the Han dynasty sent messengers to debate with Zhonghang Yue, he said: \\"There is no need for you to say anything. Just know that the quantity and quality of food and cloth that Han offered to Xiongnu must be satisfying. Otherwise, Xiongnu riders will destroy your crops when autumn comes.  Legacy  = Criticism = Zhonghang Yue is frequently viewed as a hanjian (a Han race traitor) who betrayed his country and helped its enemy.ËÆ∏Êôñ, & ÈÉ≠ÁÅøÈáë. (2009). Â§ßÊ±âÁéãÊúùÁöÑ‰∏âÂ§ß ‚ÄúÊ±âÂ•∏‚Äù. Ê≥ïÂà∂ÂçöËßà, (019), 40-42. The Records of the Grand Historian indicate that his practices harmed the interest of the Han dynasty. He calculated the population of Xiongnu and estimated its power. In addition, the arrogance that Zhonghang Yue showed in diplomatic affairs was considered an insult against the Han. His suggestions to the Shanyu led to several wars towards Han. Jia Yi, a Chinese poet and politician in the Western Han dynasty, criticized Zhonghang Yue. Jia Yi supported the establishment of a strong and united China through eliminating the Xiongnu regime and Chinese localization. There is also criticism on his shallow argument that war was the only reason for the cultural differences between Han and Xiongnu, ignoring the influence of geographical location and climate. = Support = Despite criticisms, Zhonghang Yue has received some recognition. He is considered to have been a successful geopolitician for his outstanding military talent and winning support from the Xiongnu ruler. = In popular culture = Zhonghang Yue was played by Chen Changhai in the 2005 television series The Emperor in Han Dynasty. The character was described as a \\"think tank of the Xiongnu people and the very first Hanjian in China.\\" This character is written based on the true history despite minor changes for the performance.

Born in Walworth, near London, Thomas was the brother of George William Wheeler. Their father was a wheelwright, who later became a victualler. Thomas was educated in Walton-le-Dale and Stoke Newington, and proved a successful student, remaining there until he was fourteen. After a couple of unsuccessful apprenticeships, he found work as a gardener in Kensington, and became a supporter of Robert Owen. He then developed an interest in Chartism. He was elected as the secretary of the London Chartists in 1839, as the Kensington representative of the National Charter Association in 1840 and 1841, and in 1841 was also elected to the organisation's executive. Wheeler was travelling by train with his wife on Christmas Eve in 1841, when the Sonning Cutting railway accident occurred. He and his wife were thrown some distance from the train and buried by earth and luggage. They survived, but suffered permanent injuries, and his wife miscarried. In 1842, the leading members of the National Charter Association were imprisoned. Wheeler agreed to temporarily take over the post of general secretary, and also minded the shop belonging to the former general secretary, John Campbell. In addition, he worked as the London correspondent for the Northern Echo, a newspaper sympathetic to Chartism. As a result, he stood down as secretary of the London Chartists in 1843, instead taking over the national post on a permanent basis. Wheeler became interested in Feargus O'Connor's land scheme, and in 1845 he became the first secretary of the Land Plan organisation. This took up an increasing amount of his time, and in 1846 he resigned as secretary of the National Charter Association. In 1846, he also became chief clerk of the new Land Bank, but the concentration of money under his control led to accusations of dishonesty. While an investigation found all money correctly accounted for, Wheeler found the situation stressful, and resigned from his positions in the movement. He remained involved in the Chartist movement, taking the lead in organising the huge demonstration on Kennington Common in 1848. With more time on his hands, Wheeler wrote a novel, Sunshine and Shadow, a semi-autobiographical work, which was serialised in the Northern Echo. He also advised the Amalgamated Society of Engineers during its first strike. He attended the Chartist convention of 1851 as a delegate for Exeter and Tiverton, despite having no connection with those places. The Land Company had found itself in financial difficulties, and Wheeler briefly returned as its secretary in an attempt to resolve them. He proposed reconstituting it as the National Loan Company, but this scheme did not find favour, and instead the company was wound up in 1852. In 1852, Wheeler left the Northern Echo to become secretary of a new venture, the People's Paper, which was to be edited by Ernest Jones. However, its launch was marked by disputes, and Wheeler soon resigned, along with most of the executive committee. He was also briefly involved with the British Industry Association, the Labour League and Industrial and Provident Society, and as president of the National Political Union. For several years he was the secretary of the Friend-in-Need Life Assurance Society. In 1858, Wheeler agreed to guarantee a loan for Ernest Jones, in order to keep the People's Paper afloat. Jones soon proved unable to repay the loan, but Wheeler was also unable to do so, and was placed in a debtor's prison until friends were able to pay it off. Wheeler suffered a heart attack in the summer of 1861. While he appeared to recover, he had a second heart attack in February 1862, from which he died.

The station was located at Rosehill Drive and Ravenswood Avenue, in Chicago's Edgewater neighborhood. Rose Hill opened in 1855 or 1856, and was in service for more than 100 years before closing in 1958 as part of a service revision on the North Western's commuter lines. History Stereo card view of the entrance to Rosehill Cemetery with the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad line in front. The station's platform, seen on the west side of the line, allowed for the passage of Rosehill Drive. The station that would come to be known as Rose Hill opened as a stop on the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad, a line which officially began operating January 1, 1855, and ran from Chicago to north- suburban Waukegan. The Wisconsin portion of the line opened in June, providing a connection between its namesake cities. Rose Hill was one of the earlier stops on the line, opening in 1855 or 1856, as Chittenden, named for the town of Chittenden which the station served. At the time, Chittenden was part of the civil township of Lake View, the line had but a single track running at grade, and this was the first stop outside of the Chicago city limits. Trains stopped at a pair of platforms on the west side of the track which were separated from each other by a gap permitting the passage of the unpaved Rosehill Drive. On September 16, 1857, an auction was held at the station for one hundred fifty Chittenden lots. Those buying lots were given free transport to and from the sale and ‚Äúprovided with a good dinner.‚Äù The winner that day was the Rosehill Cemetery Company which acquired all one hundred and fifty lots. Not long afterward, the new cemetery was constructed immediately west of the Chittenden stop. Rosehill Cemetery opened on July 29, 1859, and the station's name was changed to match, inconsistently using the variants \\"Rose Hill\\" and \\"Rosehill.\\" In May 1866, the Chicago and Milwaukee was leased in perpetuity to the Chicago and North Western Railway with the Chicago‚ÄìMilwaukee line becoming the Chicago and North Western's Milwaukee Division. Rose Hill's Castellated Gothic casket elevator tower seen from inside Rosehill Cemetery in 2018 On July 15, 1889, Lake View was annexed by the city of Chicago and in 1896 and 1903, the city of Chicago passed ordinances requiring the elevation of the line. It wasn't until 1908 or 1909 that the elevation was completed to Evanston. When the line was elevated, a new station was constructed using stone to match the Castellated Gothic Rosehill Cemetery Administration Building and Entry Gate which was immediately west of the station. The station building was situated at track-level on the east side of the tracks. Passengers and mourners boarded and alighted at a pair of side platforms serving the outer two tracks while a through track ran down the center. Access to the street was by a pair of stairways on the east and west sides of the embankment which led down to the north side of Rosehill Drive. An elevator, executed in the same Castellated Gothic style, was provided on the western (northbound) platform to allow for pallbearers on funeral trains to easily bring coffins down to ground level for interment. By the 1950s, Chicago and North Western management began to reassess its commuter service and came to the conclusion that the road could be operated more economically and efficiently by closing stations in and near Chicago and focusing on suburban and long-haul traffic. In June 1958, the company went before the Illinois Commerce Commission requesting permission to abandon more than twenty stops, alter train schedules, revise its ticketing structure, and raise fares on monthly tickets. On November 14, the ICC ruled in favor of granting the majority of the North Western's requests, including the closure of the Rose Hill station. The fare increase and service alterations went into effect on December 1, 1958, and Rose Hill was abandoned along with twenty other stations either in or near Chicago on the Milwaukee, Galena, and Wisconsin Divisions.

Aboriginal people are believed to have inhabited the Sydney region for at least 20,000 years.Turbet, 2001 The population of Aboriginal people between Palm Beach and Botany Bay in 1788 has been estimated to have been 1500. Those living south of Port Jackson to Botany Bay were the Cadigal people who spoke Dharug,Randwick Library webpage, 2003 while the local clan name of Maroubra people was \\"Muru-ora-dial\\".City of Sydney webpage, 2003 By the mid nineteenth century the traditional owners of this land had typically either moved inland in search of food and shelter, or had died as the result of European disease or confrontation with British colonisers. =Colonial history= In 1789 Governor Arthur Phillip referred to \\"a long bay\\", which became known as Long Bay. One of the earliest land grants in this area was made in 1824 to Captain Francis Marsh, who received 12 acres bounded by the present Botany and High Streets, Alison and Belmore Roads. In 1839 William Newcombe acquired the land north-west of the present town hall in Avoca Street. takes its name from the town of Randwick, Gloucestershire, England. The name was suggested by Simeon Pearce (1821‚Äì86) and his brother James. Simeon was born in the English Randwick and the brothers were responsible for the early development of both Randwick and its neighbour, Coogee. Simeon had come to the colony in 1841as a 21 year old surveyor. He built his Blenheim House on the 4 acres he bought from Marsh, and called his property \\"Randwick\\". The brothers bought and sold land profitably in the area and elsewhere. Simeon campaigned for construction of a road from the city to Coogee (achieved in 1853) and promoted the incorporation of the suburb. Pearce sought construction of a church modelled on the church of St. John in his birthplace. In 1857 the first St Jude's stood on the site of the present post office, at the corner of the present Alison Road and Avoca Street.Pollen, 1988, 217-8. Randwick was slow to progress. The village was isolated from Sydney by swamps and sandhills, and although a horse-bus was operated by a man named Grice from the late 1850s, the journey was more a test of nerves than a pleasure jaunt. Wind blew sand over the track, and the bus sometimes became bogged, so that passengers had to get out and push it free. From its early days Randwick had a divided society. The wealthy lived elegantly in large houses built when Pearce promoted Randwick and Coogee as a fashionable area. But the market gardens, orchards and piggeries that continued alongside the large estates were the lot of the working class. Even on the later estates that became racing empires, many jockeys and stablehands lived in huts or even under canvas. An even poorer group were the immigrants who existed on the periphery of Randwick in a place called Irishtown, in the area now known as The Spot, around the junction of St.Paul's Street and Perouse Road. Here families lived in makeshift houses, taking on the most menial tasks in their struggle to survive. In 1858 when the NSW Government passed the Municipalities Act, enabling formation of municipal districts empowered to collect rates and borrow money to improve their suburb, Randwick was the first suburb to apply for the status of a municipality. It was approved in February 1859, and its first Council was elected in March 1859. Randwick had been the venue for sporting events, as well as duels and illegal sports, from the early days in the colony's history. Its first racecourse, the Sandy Racecourse or Old Sand Track, had been a hazardous track over hills and gullies since 1860. When a move was made in 1863 by John Tait, to establish Randwick Racecourse, Simeon Pearce was furious, especially when he heard that Tait also intended to move into Byron Lodge. Tait's venture prospered, however and he became the first person in Australia to organise racing as a commercial sport. The racecourse made a big difference to the progress of Randwick. The horse-bus gave way to trams that linked the suburb to Sydney and civilisation. Randwick soon became a prosperous and lively place, and it still retains a busy residential, professional and commercial life. Today, some of the houses have been replaced by home units. Many European migrants have made their homes in the area, along with students and workers at the nearby University of NSW and the Prince of Wales Hospital.Pollen, 1988, 218-9. =Carthona= Carthona was constructed in by Mr Frank Gallagher. Up until 1986 the property was in the one family ownership. In January 1986 the Heritage Branch received representations from the National Trust of Australia (NSW) regarding the sale of Carthona at 85 Todman Avenue, Randwick. On 21 February 1986 an Interim Conservation Order was placed over the property to provide time to investigate its significance and to provide heritage management at the time. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 19 February 1988. On 2 April 1999 it was transferred to the State Heritage Register.  Description  Carthona is a single-story brick dwelling on a sandstone base. Soundly built the house features dichromatic and tuckpointed brickwork to the front elevation and decorative timber setailing to the verandah and gable end in the Queen Anne manner. The house features a hipped slate roof with terracotta ridge capping and a gable over the front bedroom. The tall chimneys have all survived and feature roughcast and cement detailing with terracotta chimney pots. The front door, with sidelights and fanlight feature leaded glass. Timber-framed windows are double-hung sash and those in the front elevation feature coloured glass and etched decoration in a star pattern. The interior of the house retains almost all of its original detailing including fine ornamental plaster ceilings with Australia flora and fauna motifs. Doors, architecture and skirtings are finished in original wood graining. Fireplaces are fine marble (drawing room) and timber with tiled surrounds (bedrooms and dining room).

As a teenager, Ursula Edgcumbe worked in the studio of the sculptor James Havard Thomas before enrolling at the Slade School of Art, where Thomas also taught. Edgcumbe was at the Slade from 1916 until 1921 during which time she won the scholarship prize for sculpture in 1918. She then worked as an architectural carver, often with the architect George L Kennedy. An early commission was for the war memorial at Zennor in Cornwall. Working in the local granite, Edgcumbe produced a frieze surmounted on a column designed by Kennedy. Another early commission was for a fireplace frieze at Bilbury Court in Gloucestershire. She exhibited with the London Group, the Royal Society of British Artists, the Women's International Art Club and was, in 1929, a founding member of the National Society of Painters, Sculptors, Engravers and Potters. She had her first solo sculpture show at the Leger Galleries in April 1936 but abandoned sculpture for painting in 1940. After the end of World War II, Edgcumbe concentrated on painting, mostly birds and industrial scenes, and had several solo exhibitions of her paintings at leading London galleries. A memorial exhibition of her paintings and sculpture was held at the Gillian Jason Gallery in 1986.

The total construction cost is estimated at ‚Ç¨25 million ($ million). The foundation stone was placed on 30 January 2018. Thessaloniki was chosen over Athens due to the degree to which it suffered during the Second World War. Thessaloniki was from the beginning under German occupation, contrary to most of Greece which was occupied by Italy or Bulgaria. Adolf Hitler planned to incorporate the city into the Third Reich as a reprisal for its involvement in the First World War (Salonica Front). In 1942 the German forces started implementing the Nuremberg Laws in the city and ordered male Jews to register at Eleftherias Square, where they were publicly tortured and humiliated before being forced into labour. A Jewish Ghetto was established near the train station. In 1943 the city's 56,000 Jews were deported, by use of 19 Holocaust trains, to Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where 43,00049,000 of them were killed. The train journey from Thessaloniki to the concentration camps was the longest of all Holocaust trains, and Jews had to buy a ticket.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999.  History  The Centennial Parklands, as it stands today, represents 190 years of colonial history. The settlers had an immediate impact on the lives of the Gadi people whose clan territory takes in most of the Sydney peninsula. Gadi country extends between what is now Darling Harbour and South Head, and includes Centennial Park, Moore Park and Queens Park. Close to where Centennial Park and Moore Park are today, an area that became known as the Kangaroo Ground was recorded on a map engraved by J. Walker in 1791 or 1793. This map shows the location of what the English called the Kangaroo Ground, in the clan territories of the Gadi. The richer soils and park like atmosphere observed here by Tench and others would almost certainly have been created through regular firing by the Gadi to keep the undergrowth clear and attract kangaroos and other large game to the area for hunting. =Sydney Common= Centennial Parklands, comprising Centennial Park, Moore Park and Queens Park, are part of the Second Sydney Common dedicated in 1811.Pearson et al, 1999 As the settlement of Sydney began to develop it became necessary to set aside common land on the outskirts of the town. On 5 October 1811 Governor Macquarie proclaimed the to the south of South Head Road as the Sydney Common, for use by the public. The common land contained a vital resource in the form of a constant supply of pure water due to the natural aquifers present in the Botany Sands system. In 1820, Macquarie set aside the water reserve in the east of the Sydney Common. Between 1827 and 1838, Lachlan Water Tunnel (Busby's Bore) was built providing a supply of freshwater to a terminal in Hyde Park. It remained Sydney Town's sole source of water supply until 1858, when it was supplanted by a scheme to pump water from the Botany Swamps, located further to the south. =Lachlan Swamps & water supply= The swamps, located within the Sydney Common, were naturally aquified and were an ideal source of water. In recognition of this precious resource, the Lachlan Water Reserve was founded in 1820. The Tank Stream supply of water for Sydney was inadequate and had a high level of pollutants, in 1825, the colonial government set up an enquiry into the use of the Lachlan Swamps to provide a water supply to Sydney. John Busby, a mineral surveyor, was appointed to design a water system to convey the water from the swamps to the town centre. Busby originally considered conveying the water using iron pipes, but assessed this would be too expensive. Finally he proposed a long tunnel be constructed, entirely through Crown Land. =Busby's Bore= The Lachlan Water Tunnel, better known as Busby's Bore, was Sydney's first piped water supply. The \\"Bore\\" or tunnel was, on average between high by wide and carried water from the Lachlan Swamps to Hyde Park. The whole length of the Tunnel was and capable of holding gallons and 15 days' supply of water. Sydney Council took control of the Water Supply in 1842 and was responsible for the whole of the Lachlan Water Reserve. In 1861, it was decided that the whole of the Sydney Common did in fact belong to the people of Sydney. Common land was given to the authority of the Municipal Council. Moore Park was then laid out. To meet increasing demands for water, portions of the Swamp were dammed in 1872, resulting in an embankment just below what is now known as Kensington ponds, and a series of seven dams throughout the swamp. The first major development encroaching onto the Sydney Common was the siting of Victoria Barracks on the Old South Head Road (now Oxford Street) on the north east of the common. Designed in 1838 and completed ten years later, the Barracks was strategically sited between Port Jackson and Botany Bay to prevent an enemy invasion. The soldiers soon established the Military Garden, and by 1852 they had added the Garrison Cricket ground and a rifle range on land to the south of the barracks. In 1866 the Sydney Common was given to the Municipal Council of Sydney for development under the Sydney Common Improvement Bill of 1866. =A public park= In the second half of the nineteenth century, parts of Sydney Common were made into parkland. Lord Carrington, the Governor of NSW 1885-1890, advocated the city of Sydney should have a large recreational space in the fashion of a \\"grand park\\". Sir Henry Parkes, the premier, recognized the potential of this proposal and facilitated its realisation. Charles Moore JP, the Mayor of Sydney from 1867 to 1869, worked on developing a public park for the recreation of the people of Sydney. Allotments of land alongside the South Head Road (Old South Head Road, now Oxford Street) were sold to fund the developments and soon Moore had overseen the construction of Randwick and Moore Park Roads and the creation of a public park incorporating the land around them. Charles Moore, Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, supplied the distinctive tree plantations.Conybeare Morrison & Partners, v.2, 2005. =Moore Park= In 1866 Sydney City Council dedicated of the north west section of Sydney Common as a recreation ground for the public to help alleviate growing pressures for outdoor activities, particularly organised sports. The area was named Moore Park in 1867 after Charles Moore, Mayor of Sydney City Council 1867-1869. Moore Park became the focus for major sporting events and entertainment facilities with the establishment of the Zoological Gardens in 1879, the Royal Agricultural Society Showground, and the first course of the Australian Golf Club in 1882. =Queens Park= Queens Park was created by the Centennial Celebration Act 1887. By 1895 it contained an eleven-hole golf course which was removed to Botany in 1899. Since the 1930s Queens Park has been used as a sports field by Christian Brothers College, Waverley and various local sporting groups.PoM, V1: 9-10, 1997 =Centennial Park= The Centenary Bill was presented to NSW Parliament on 27 June 1887 introducing the notion of a park that would be accessible to the whole mass of people down to the very poorest class of the community. It would also transform what was regarded as an unsightly area into a region of loveliness and beauty. Centennial Park was created by the Centennial Celebrations Act 1887 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the colony. This Act, however, did not define the appropriate uses of the park. The park was established to commemorate Australia's centenary in 1888 and was opened on 26 January 1888 by Sir Henry Parkes. He stated that \\"this grand park is emphatically the people's park, and you must always take as much interest in it as if by your own hands you had planted the flowers, the park will be one of the grandest adornments to this beautiful country.\\" The newly named \\"Centennial Park\\" became the focus for the Centenary celebration preparations. Frederick Franklin, an English civil engineer, appears to have prepared the original design of the park, although historically the preservation and development of the Reserve as Centennial Park is credited to Lord Carrington, Sir Henry Parkes and Charles Moore. The layout and landscape design of the park is attributed to Charles Moore, the Director of the Botanic Gardens from 1848-96 (but no connection with Charles Moore, Mayor). Moore enlisted the labour of the unemployed to transform the native scrubland into an open expanse of public land. James Jones, head gardener of the Botanic Gardens became the General Overseer of Centennial Park and diary entries in his Day Book indicate that he played a significant part in its construction, although his desire to conserve the native flora of the area was not fulfilled. =Woollahra Reservoir (within Centennial Park)= Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144) was completed in 1880. Together with Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) and Waverley Reservoir No.1 (Covered) (WS 0132), it is the only other service reservoir, still in use, which was originally supplied as part of the Botany Swamps Scheme, 1858-1886. It is the second oldest reservoir still functioning in Sydney. The Botany Swamps gave way to the Upper Nepean Scheme in 1888, with temporary supply provided by the Hudson Scheme between 1886 and 1888. Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144) was originally supplied by pump from Crown Street Reservoir and serves the higher parts of the Eastern Suburbs. It also now receives water from Centennial Park No.1 Reservoir by its associated pumping station.  Description  Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144) is a rectangular covered reservoir. The roof is covered with fill and grassed over. An unusual feature is the puddled clay membrane on the exterior face of the brick walls, the clay being covered by earth embankment. The puddled clay has been a successful method of enhancing the watertight requirement of the walls. The reservoir is located in the north east corner of Centennial Park, and is unobtrusive in its setting.  Heritage listing  As at 5 May 2005, one of only three service reservoirs, still in service, which were associated and dependent upon the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). It is also the second oldest reservoir still in service in the Sydney Water Supply System (Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) being the oldest. The reservoir exemplifies the high standard of engineering practice available at the end of the 19th century, in particular puddled clay blanket, brick walls and roof. The Centennial Park Group of three reservoirs, including Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144), 1880, Centennial Park No. 1 (WS 22), 1899, and Centennial Park No. 2 (WS 23), 1925, demonstrate the development in construction technology for covered reservoirs, as well as the dramatic increase in demand in the growing Sydney suburbs. The group is unique in the SWC system, because of their size, design and level of architectural detailing. All covered reservoirs are highly significant within the SWC system, since all differ in construction technology, design and architectural detailing. All therefore contribute to our understanding of the development of covered reservoirs in NSW. Woollahra Reservoir WS022 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. One of only three service reservoirs, still in service, which were associated and dependent upon the Botany Swamps Scheme (1858-1886). It is also the second oldest reservoir still in service in the Sydney Water Supply System (Crown Street Reservoir (WS 34) being the oldest). This reservoir demonstrates the high level of demand by a populous suburban community. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Centennial Park Group of three reservoirs, including Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144), 1880, Centennial Park No. 1 (WS 22), 1899, and Centennial Park No. 2 (WS 23), 1925, is unique in the SWC system, because of their size, design and level of architectural detailing. Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144) is notable for the unobtrusive way it fits into its setting. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The reservoir exemplifies the high standard of engineering practice available at the end of the 19th century, in particular puddled clay blanket, brick walls and roof.

All covered reservoirs are highly significant within the SWC system, since all differ in construction technology, design and architectural detailing. All therefore contribute to our understanding of the development of covered reservoirs in NSW. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. One of a small group of large covered reservoirs in brick or concrete, each demonstrating differences in construction, design and architectural detailing. It is one of only four reservoirs associated with the Botany Swamps Supply.

Prior to the 1850s, water had been supplied via natural water courses, or through Busby's Bore, which tapped the Lachlan Swamps in what is now Centennial Park. During the 1850s, the Botany swamps were tapped, with a pumping station transferring water to a new reservoir built in Crown Street, which in turn supplied Sydney's residents. Between 1859 and 1899, a series of five service reservoirs were built east of the city to supply water to Sydney and the developing eastern suburbs. The reservoirs were designed to act as regulating valves, balancing out the local supply and demand and also ensuring a satisfactory water pressure to the user. Centennial Park Reservoir No.1 was the last of the five nineteenth century city reservoirs to be constructed and was completed in 1899. In 1898, the Paddington Reservoir went out of service, as its function was taken over by the larger and more elevated Centennial Park Reservoir No.1. In 1925, the operation of Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 was augmented by the construction of a second reservoir nearby. Circa 1930, the Tennis Pavilion, designed by architect Howard Jouriand, was relocated to Lane Cove National Park and it remained there until . In 1974, defects in the walls led to the lowering of the FSL (Full Storage Level) by one metre until, in 1990 - 1992, part of the battered earth side wall was strengthened with concrete. The Reservoir is now operating at full capacity.  Description  The main walls of the reservoir are of brick, with a typical gravity- retaining-wall cross section, supported in general by sloping rubble fill which is in turn covered with earth fill to give an overall slope of approximately 1 in 2 where the reservoir is in bank, and steeper where it is partly in excavation. The reservoir roof was covered from its inception with \\"coke dust\\" and grassed for public access, no doubt to provide Sunday afternoon strollers with an unimpeded view of the pleasant, gently undulating, Botany Valley and Centennial Lakes. The perimeter of the top of the reservoir is graced with a magnificent cast-iron fence, complete with gates, made by the Darlington Iron Works (Sydney). This, together with the central brick access tower, continues to bestow on the reservoir something of its former glory. The curtilage boundary is defined by Oxford Street and Carrington Street as the northern and southern boundaries; the west boundary is approximately a line along the projection southwards of Moncur Street and the east boundary is a line parallel to the west boundary, between the corner of Carrington Drive and Broome Avenue to Oxford Street. The Reservoir is almost completely intact. The pavilion has been removed. = Modifications and dates = Tennis Pavilion, designed by architect Howard Jouriand, was relocated to Lane Cove National Park and remained there until .  Heritage listing  As at 21 April 2005, Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 was the largest covered storage reservoir constructed in Australia at the time it was built and it remains very large even by present-day standards. It is a relic of the early development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme and the subsequent expansion of water reticulation throughout the suburban areas of Sydney. It is also associated with the rapid urban expansion of the eastern suburbs of Sydney in the late 19th century. The reservoir demonstrates exemplary engineering practices at the turn of the century in relation to design, construction methods and manual skills, particularly in regards to the vaulted arch roof. The reservoir has played a continuous, on-going role for over a century as an important facility of the water supply system, particularly for the eastern suburbs. The exterior of the Reservoir has aesthetic qualities which relate to its parkland environment and is a local landmark. The level of ornamentation evident in the structure demonstrates the importance placed upon the appearance of engineering structures in the era in which it was built. The Centennial Park Group of three reservoirs, including Woollahra Reservoir (WS 144), 1880, Centennial Park No. 1 (WS 22), 1899, and Centennial Park No. 2 (WS 23), 1925, demonstrate the development in construction technology for covered reservoirs, as well as the dramatic increase in demand in the growing Sydney suburbs. The group is unique in the SWC system, because of their size, design and level of architectural detailing. Centennial Park Reservoir WS001 was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 November 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is a relic of the early development of the Upper Nepean Water Supply Scheme and the subsequent expansion of reticulation throughout the suburban areas of Sydney. It is associated with the rapid urban expansion of the eastern suburbs of Sydney in the late 19th century, following the provision of the tramway transport system and the breakup of the large estates. The reservoir demonstrates water engineering practice at the turn of the century in regard to design knowledge, construction methods and manual skills, particularly in regards to the arched roof, practices which have since been superseded by reinforced concrete. The reservoir has played a continuous, on-going role extending over 87 years as an important facility of the water supply system, particularly for the eastern suburbs. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is an excellent example of the nineteenth century practice of enhancement of the utilitarian with a decorative presentation and is amongst the finest examples of this in Sydney. The exterior of Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is an attractive, well proportioned landscape area, enclosed by decorative fencing, located within an area of parkland of high landscape, amenity and aesthetic values. The interior of the reservoir, when empty, is a remarkable environment, with the forest of timber posts, vaulted arched roof and vast space. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 was the site, in the early 1990s, of a public access program, instituted whilst the Reservoir was empty for refurbishment works, which attracted many thousands of members of the public, demonstrating a significant interest and value placed upon these structures by the public at large. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is highly regarded by the public as represented by the National Trust of Australia (NSW), as evidenced by its identification in the National Trust Register. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 contains representative examples of a range of construction techniques, materials and technologies of the late nineteenth century. It provides evidence of the expectations and planning context of the designers of the water supply system for Sydney. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is one of the few in-ground, covered water storage reservoirs of the nineteenth century surviving in Sydney. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Centennial Park Reservoir No. 1 is a representative example of a large in-ground covered water storage reservoir of its period.

Early life and education  Anne Kiguta was born in Nairobi, Kenya to parents who were devoted to the Christian church and charity. She is the youngest of four daughters. Her mum ran a hospital ministry that would visit the sick and give them food. She had an inclination towards social work from an early age and hoped to study law after secondary school. Kiguta attended the St. Christopher's Prep School before joining the Rusinga High School in Nairobi from year 8 to year 13. She attended Daystar University for her undergraduate degree in Public Relations and Mass Media, clearing campus in 2008.  Career  When she turned 18, her local church started a radio station. The station manager encouraged her to audition. Kiguta was offered the job, which effectively halted her pursuit of a career in law. This began her passion for the Kenyan media industry. At Hope FM she worked as a show host and producer on Plug in and The Top 40 countdown. During the holidays, she interned in Hope FM's newsroom covering the local crime-beat. It is then that her passion for journalism began. Kiguta began anchoring the news bulletin on the breakfast and mid-morning slot while still dabbling in entertainment hosting additional shows on Friday and Saturdays. She remained at Hope FM radio between 2003 and 2006. Kiguta later went to Capital FM to work as a Senior Anchor and reporter before her big break in television.http://hashtagsquare.co.ke/ann-kiguta-biography/ Kiguta went on to work at Royal Media Services in October 2013 as the Group Digital Manager and Senior Anchor.

Zero Waste Week is an environmental campaign to reduce landfill waste, and takes place annually during the first full week in September. It is a non-commercial grass-roots campaign to demonstrate means and methods to reduce waste, foster community support and bring awareness to the increasing problem of environmental waste and pollution. Aims The aim of Zero Waste Week is reduce landfill waste, increase recycling and encourage people to participate in the circular economy. A Zero Waste Week campaign runs predominantly on social media and the internet and aim to reach people who want to reduce their household or business waste, reuse or recycle materials. Zero Waste week actively encourages people to reduce the use of synthetic materials and plastic packaging, and promotes plastic reuse and conscientious recycling to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill or for incineration. Zero Waste week adopts the adage there‚Äôs no such place as away meaning when we throw something away, it goes somewhere else, often causing harm or toxicity to the eco- system. The campaign's main directive is to bring awareness to people that we are all individually and collectively responsible for what we consume and that the short time of usefulness is only a small part of the overall lifecycle of any product. Zero Waste Week's long term goals are to create long term change in people's habits, including generating more demand for sustainable products, to lobby producers, and governmental decision makers, and to bring awareness for the need of good custodianship to the upcoming generation. Events Screenshot taken from Twitter, September 5, 2016 showing that the #ZeroWasteWeek trended in the UK for nine hours An online campaign runs during Zero Waste Week, and events organized by different groups take place in London, Scotland, New York, Hong Kong, and others. https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk/content/zero-waste-week Zero Waste Week Scotland] Local and national events are held annually where participants and communities make a concerted effort to demonstrate that household, business and industrial waste can be eliminated or reduced.  Challenges  During Zero Waste Week people are challenged to meet different goals, for example repairing clothes or sewing to combat disposable fashion, or to reduce their weekly waste so that it can fit in a jam jar. History Zero Waste week was founded by Rachelle Strauss in 2008 and began as a national campaign in the United Kingdom. The term Zero Waste Week is now used by many organisations, groups and individuals not connected to the original campaign. Strauss first became interested in zero waste after being affected by the Boscastle flood of 2004, a freak weather event that event that she saw as the result of manmade climate change. In September 2008 Strauss launched the first Zero Waste Week with an internet campaign from her blog, to persuade people to reduce, reuse and recycle waste. In September 2013 a new website was setup for Zero Waste Week, and by 2017 people from seventy-three countries had taken part. In 2018 Zero Waste Week reached its ten year milestone. Many countries run their own Zero Waste Week campaign in co-ordination with the original Zero Waste week or independently.  Awards and recognition  In 2015 the UK's parliament passed an early day motion to celebrate Zero Waste Week. Founder Rachelle Strauss received the Points Of Light award in September 2018 from the UK government for her work on Zero Waste Week. Society and culture Zero Waste Week was described in the National Geographic Documentary Naked Science Series: ‚ÄòSurviving Nature‚Äôs Fury‚Äô 2005 and in the film Trashed.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVEfr7Tfm-g&feature;=youtu.be&t;=1h14m18s Other campaigns for Zero Waste Week The term Zero Waste Week has been gradually adopted by other campaigns and organisations to run a week of events and activities, often with focus on specific current sustainability issues. =National Marine Sanctuaries= Students for Zero Waste Week is a school- driven, week-long campaign to reduce waste on school campuses and within local communities and started in the year 2015/2016. =Harvard University = During Earth Week 2014, Harvard University's Gutman Caf√© held a zero waste week during which it tried to divert as much of its trash as possible from the landfill. =Hong Kong Cleanup= Hong Kong Cleanup, a week long campaign of public awareness and on-ground activities. =The Island's Sounder= Orcas Christian School's Zero Waste Week was held on the first week of April with a focus was on sustainability and re-usability. =Emory University= Emory University OSI/RHA Zero Waste Week raises awareness and support for sustainable practices on campus.

Fishing, of any severity or effort, will impose an additional layer of mortality to the natural population equilibrium and will be selective to certain genetic traits within that organism's gene pool. This removal of selected traits fundamentally changes the population gene frequency, resulting in the artificially induced microevolution by the proxy of the survival of untargeted fish and their propagation of heritable biological characteristics. This artificial selection often counters natural life-history pattern for many species, such as causing early sexual maturation, diminished sizes for matured fish, and reduced fecundity in the form of smaller egg size, lower sperm counts and viability during reproductive events. These effects can have prolonged effects on the adaptability or fitness of the species to their environmental factors. Fisheries-induced evolution differ to the norm Darwinian evolution model by the direct human factor. For FIE, fishing enforces a greater selection pressure for traits, often through sheer effort and catch numbers, which can disparage natural selection pressures such as predator-prey interactions and environmental influences.  Causes  Fishing practices that permanently remove animals from their population (i.e. not catch and release) drive direct fisheries-induced evolution by removing the genetic materials of those animals from the population. Individuals that are untargeted, through the selection bias of fishing gears and/or legislation, are allowed to reproduce and proliferate their genetic materials. As fishing pressures persist, traits belonging to non-selected organisms are preserved through survival and become more dominant in frequency within the gene pool. Additionally, fishing on a targeted species incur knock-on effects to those around it by its disturbance of their natural interactions. In these situations, specific traits of the untargeted species may be favourable under the diminutive presence, or absence, of the targeted species, and therefore indirectly selected for. = Direct selection = The direct selection for biological traits through fishery practices is the result of fishery management regulations, and gear restrictions and selectivities. The most obvious artificial selection for traits through management legislation can be observed in the imposed regulations on size, sex, seasonality, and locations. Catch size regulations vary with specificity to the targeted species and is often used to prevent exploitation during a specific part of the life cycle for the organism. Such regulations arose in response to the effects of FIE observed by the fisheries of Atlantic Cod (Gadus morhua). Prior to the fishing technological revolution that has led to the species moratorium, the exploitation of Atlantic Cod have been selective towards larger-sized fish since the 1500s. Catch data for the species have quantitatively shown that this selectivity for larger fish for over 500 years have shifted the life-history patterns, resulting in earlier sexual maturation and smaller sizes at said maturation. Sexual selectivity by a fishery works on the theoretical foundation that the preservation of females allows their reproductive input to offset the fishing mortality. Fisheries of species with low fecundity such as mud crabs (Scylla serrata) and blue swimmer crabs (Portunus armatus) often adopt this method and only allow the harvesting of males. The direct selection for traits, with respect to sex selectivity, occurs when specific characteristics or behaviours increase the susceptibility of the organisms for harvest. For example, corking wrasses (Symphodus melops) are harvested as a biological control for sea lice within farmed salmon facilities of the northern hemisphere. Male fish dominate these wild fisheries in both catch per unit effort and weight owing to their strong nesting behaviour and territorial nature, which differentiate them from females and sneaker males. Persistent fishing pressures over the years have reduced maturation age and size for these nesting males, in addition to increasing the density of sneaker males to the detriment of the localised population. = Indirect selection = Indirect fishery-induced evolution occurs when a species with some level of ecological significance is targeted by a fishery, and their diminished presence within the ecology causes a flow on effect to other untargeted species. Keystone or umbrella species provide many ecological services to the environment which they belong to, ranging from the provision of habitat and food, to the control of biodiversity by preventing any one organism from dominating. Removal or reduction of these organisms often cause significant changes to the behaviours and physiology of the organisms which were once controlled. Non-migratory reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus, C. amblyrhynchos, and Triaenodon obesus) play the vital role in weeding out sick and ill-adapted individuals from within a population, in addition to controlling the abundance of larger size fish. Thus, these sharks are an ever- present mortality factor for many reef organisms. Fisheries targeting these apex predators inherently allow for the proliferation of medium-sized predatory fishes (e.g. barracudas, juvenile groupers, trevallies, snappers) at the expense of the cohabiting smaller species. When this happen, the FIE responses observed from smaller species have been consistent with their increasing egg production and shifted life-history for early sexual maturation. Another example of FIE that is instigated indirectly can be seen in the ornamental or aquarium trade industry. In particular, corals and anemones are highly prized ornamental commodities and are often harvested at unsustainable rates for profit within the Malay archipelago. Removal of anemones at rates higher than their resettlement into the reefs, as observed in the Philippines, is known to have caused drastic reduction in the localised population of clownfish or anemonefish (Amphiprion sp.). Evolutionarily, anemone fish observed on reefs that were subjected to intense and prolonged anemone fishing were significantly smaller, even for mature adult pairs, than those found living with an anemone. This size reduction is attributed to their need to hide in small coral crevices in the absence of a host.  Evidence  Outside of observational data collected from active fisheries, the evidence for fisheries-induced evolution, or its symptoms, may be discerned through both commercial and recreational anecdotes. These stories often articulate the diminishing catch, reduction in their weight and length records, in addition to the mandatory increase to fishing efforts over time to attain similar fishing quotas to their historical references. However, experimental data was needed to clarify two fundamental questions regarding FIE, so that the aforementioned ramifications of smaller sizes and early maturation may not be attributed to non-anthropogenic factors such as population flux. The two evidentiary questions: a) Is fishing pressure capable of changing the gene frequency of a population to cause microevolution within such a short time frame? b) How can non-selective fishing gears (gill nets and trawlers) be selective for certain traits? = Experimental evidence = The implementation of aquaculture experimental designs afford the possibility of isolating different biological traits and observing their impacts and heredity within a population. A study by Solberg et al. (2013) demonstrated that with sufficient fishing pressure and selectivity, a substantial change to a population genotype may be achieved without the geological time-frame often associated with evolution. In this study, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were subjected to a modified 'common garden' design, and the researchers isolated stress as an abiotic independent variable to the growth rates of salmon. By selecting for fish with a lower biological response to stress, a domesticated population was created within 10 generations of breeding, which exhibited a threefold increase in growth rate over its wild counterpart. Thus, the difference between the absence of larger fish, which can be misattributed to overfishing, and FIE lies in the inherited biological characteristics that were untargeted by fishing. Fishing techniques such as gill nets and trawling are often associated with a lack of selectivity within the environment which they are operated. It is difficult to establish whether selectivity can occur under these practices, when fishing data suggest that an entire localised population may be caught or up to 80% of the effort to go to bycatches and not the targeted species. An experiment by Biro and Post (2008) shows that despite being mechanically unselective of gill nets, behavioural variation in certain fish species can indeed affect the likelihood of them being caught and therefore be a function for selectivity. Using a ‚Äòselection experiment in the field‚Äô model, two genotypes of rainbow trouts (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were transplanted into identical artificial lake habitats and subjected to matching gill net fishing pressures. The net in question were designed to capture all size variability within the simulated populations. Trouts exhibiting the genotypes for faster growth rates and therefore a more active lifestyle were found to have a 60% increase chance to be caught in comparison to those characterised by the more sedentary genotype. Therefore, for 'non-selective' fishing methods, the selecting factor rests not on the gear itself but on the inherent behavioural variations within the population.  Implications  Fisheries-induced evolution is a function of the fishing-induced genetic drift, and to some extent represent the reduction of genetic diversity within the targeted population. For many exploited population, this reduction in genetic diversity has been predicted to reduce their adaptability to both environmental variability and ecological competitiveness. Indeed, the commonly observed fisheries-induced adaptation of younger and smaller size at sexual maturation counter specific life-history characteristics that would enable interspecies competition for resources. A biological model by Kindsvater and Palkovacs (2017) shows that FIE Atlantic cod, due to their smaller sizes, actually belong to a lower trophic level irrespective of their original position prior to the species moratorium. Furthermore, the FIE effect of reducing egg counts and their viability have weakened the number of recruitments back into the population after spawning, thereby reducing the localised population density. However, at the reduced population abundance and smaller sizes, the increase in per capita resource has been stipulated to counteract the effects of competitions between different species by reducing intraspecific interactions, which can allow for maximal density-dependent growth to happen. This also means that for harvesting to be sustainable, yearly or seasonal assessment of viable reproductive stocks and their recruitment rates must be performed to account for the compromised fecundity and recovery statuses. There is limited data on the interactions between FIE affected species and their robustness to environmental fluctuations. For many species, the additional mortality rate and the frequency of harvesting exerted by the fisheries make it difficult to elucidate how environmental factors such as temperatures, salinity and currents can be beneficial or detrimental for stocks, since their effects on deaths or recruitment gains are diminutive in comparison. However, with the rapidly evolving climates stemming from the anthropogenic inputs, an understanding of how FIE affects the adaptability of these aquatic population will be necessary, not only for future stock assessments, but also sustainable harvesting.

Penglipuran village is famous as one of the tourist destinations in Bali because of its society who still preserve their traditional culture in their daily lives. The architecture of buildings and land processing still follows the concept of Tri Hita Karana, the philosophy of Balinese society regarding the balance of relations between God, humans and their environment. Penglipuran Village succeeded in building tourism that benefited all of their communities without losing their culture and traditions. In 1995, Penglipuran Village also received a Kalpataru award from the Indonesian Government for its efforts to protect the Bamboo Forest in their local ecosystem.  Geography  Penglipuran village is one of the traditional villages from Bangli district and Bali province, Indonesia. The total area of this village reaches 112 hectares with an altitude of 500‚Äì600 meters above the sea and located about 5 kilometers from the Bangli City or 45 kilometers from the Denpasar City. The village is surrounded by other traditional villages. Kayang village in the north, Kubu village in the east, Gunaksa village in the south and Sansang river in the west. Temperatures vary from cool to cold (16-29 degrees) and averages rainfall around 2000 mm per year. Ground surface is consider flat with a height of 1‚Äì15 meters. Main Street in Penglipuran Village  History  Penglipuran Village is believed to be inhabited during the reign of I Dewa Gede Putu Tangkeban III. Almost all of the villagers believe that they are from Bayung Gede Village. In that time, the people of Bayung Gede were people who were experts in religious, custom and defense activities. Because of their abilities, they are often called to the Bangli Kingdom. But because of the distance, the Bangli kingdom finally provided a temporary area for the people of Bayung Gede to rest. This place is often referred to as a Kubu Bayung. Kubu means \\"camp\\" and \\"bayung\\" means people from Bayung Gede village. This place is then believed to be the village they live in now. They also believe that this is the reason that explains the similarity of traditional rules and building structure between Penglipuran village and Bayung Gede village. Regarding the origin of the word Panglipuran Village, there are 2 different perceptions that are believed by the community. The first is Penglipuran means \\"pengeling pura\\" with \\"Pengeling\\" means to remember and \\"temple\\" means ancestral place. Furthermore, the second perception says that penglipura comes from the word \\"pelipur\\" which means comfort and \\"lipur\\" which means unhappiness. So if combined, penglipuran means a place for consolation. This perception arises because the Bangli king is said to often visit this village to meditate.  Society  = Population = Based on records from Kelihan Dinas (officials below lurah that specifically handling government administration) in 2002, up until July there were 832 people living in Penglipuran Village. The 832 individuals consisted of 425 men and 407 women with 197 head of family. The families is divided by their status which is 76 head of families with Pangayah / Karma Pangarep status (permanent members with customary rights and obligations) and 121 heads of families with Pangayah/Krama Roban status (Temporary member referred to as the responsibility of one of Pangayah Pangarep) The most recent data in early 2012 showed that there is no visible increase in the population of Penglipuran Village which consists of 980 individuals joined in 229 families (76 families), issued by I Wayan Kajeng, Chief Administrative of the Penglipuran Traditional Village). In 12 years the population in this village increased by 200 people. = Education and Job = In 2002, as many as 426 people from Penglipuran Village completed their elementary education, while 91 people had an education level up to junior high school. 156 people completed high school and 68 people managed to complete the highest level of education which is University. Most of Penglipuran Village people choose farming as their job, followed by becoming a private employee. While the rest is divided between civil servants/ABRI, traders, breeders, craftsmen and the last one is laborers. = Marriage = Marriage and the family lineage is seen as something that very important for people of Penglipuran Village. The majority of people in Penglipuran Village married the people from their own village too in order to preserve the family lineage. Therefore, most of the population is still bound by blood relations with each other. If there is a man from Penglipuran Village who marries a girl from another clan/family outside of Penglipuran Village, then he still has to carry out his obligation as a member of the Penglipuran Village society.  Tri Mandala Land Management  The land management of Penglipuran Village is strongly influenced by Tri Mandala. According to Tri Mandala's concept, the land is divided into 3 zones according to the value of their purity. The zone will then be placed according to the spiritual orientation called \\"Kaja- Kelod\\". Things that are considered the most sacred will be placed towards Mount Agung (the most sacred place in Bali) and the opposite of the most sacred things will be placed towards the sea. # Utama Mandala is at the northernmost side of the village, therefore this zone is consider as the most sacred place. It contains places called ‚ÄúPura‚Äù or temples to worship of gods. Pura Puseh Desa is used to worship the god Brahma (creator god) and Pura Bale Agung is used to worship the God Wisnu (God of Preservation) # Madya mandala is a zone for humans. Here the people of Penglipuran Village will live with their families in a building unit called the \\"Pekarangan\\" # Nista mandala is in the southernmost side of the village and is an impure zone. Therefore, it contains the village grave and Pura Dalem or a place to worship God Shiva (God of Destroyer) The number of yards in this village is 77 with 1 \\"karang memadu\\" (a special ‚Äúpekarangan‚Äù for family who do polygamy) and 76 \\"karang kerti\\". Karang Kerti means a place to serve God by having a good married life. Like village land management, the Pekarangan unit also follows the Tri Mandala concept. ‚ÄúUtama Mandala‚Äù in one's pekarangan will contain a family temple to worship their god and ancestors. ‚ÄúMadya mandala‚Äùwill consist of a kitchen, a bedroom, etc. where daily activities take place. Finally, Nista Mandala is usually used to dry clothes and store livestock. One of the main components of almost entire building in desa Penglipuran is bamboo. They use 4-5 layers of bamboo that are linked to each other to build roofs and weave bamboo to make room dividing walls. But lately they has begun to use modern construction because of the large amount of bamboo cut. One Pekarangan unit can be entered through two sides with the main door shaped like a gate and called \\"angkul- angkul\\". One of the other important buildings in this village is Bale Banjar. This building does not have walls and is shared by residents for mass Ngaben ceremonies or community meetings.  Awig-Awig  To achieve mutual harmony in the community, residents of the Penglipuran Village have 2 types of laws that they obey and follow, named Awig (written rules) and Drestha (unwritten customs). =Monogamy= For the people of Penglipuran Village, polygamy or having more than one wife is prohibited and considered taboo. If a person has more than one wife, he and his wives must move from Karang Kerti to Karang Memandu (outer part of the village). His rights and obligation as part of Penglipuran Village society is also revoked. After the person has moved, the villagers will build a house for them to live on but they will not be able to pass through public roads or enter the temple nor attend the traditional activities. = Worship at Given Temple = Not all temple can be visited by everyone to worship except the main temple which is Pura Besakih. Therefore, Hindus of Bali have temple that they worship and go to. These temples are distinguished by their respective families, including the Penglipuran Traditional Village. Temple in Penglipuran Village  Obligations to the main temple - Gebog Doma (Inter Regional)  Because the people of Penglipuran Village are immigrants that has just come to a new area, so they have to worship the nearest temple of their area, Kehen Temple, which is the largest temple in the Bangli Region.  Obligations to Kahyangan Tiga (Inter-Village)  The most important obligation for Balinese people is to worship \\"Kahyangan-Tiga\\" located in their respective villages. In the Village of Penglipuran the obligation is divided into: # Penataran Temple - Temples to worship deity Brahma as the creator of the entire universe. The temple is located in the center of village, next to Puseh Temple. # Puseh Temple - Temple to worship deity Vishnu as a support for all of life. This temple is located in the most sacred place in the Penglipuran Village, and is the first temple built in this village # Dalem Temple - Temple to worship deity Shiva as a god of fusion. Therefore, this temple is located at the bottom of the village, leading to the sea. The villagers believe that it will help the souls of deceased people to return to their place Every 210 days based on the Balinese calendar, there is a Galungan celebration organized by Kahyangan-Tiga members. Every citizen must prepare an offerings, food, and things needed for the celebration.  Obligations in the Family Temple  In each family home yard there is a Sanggah or a small temple intended for the ancestors of the family. = Village Governance System = The Penglipuran Customary Village Government System was compiled in an Indigenous Leadership Institution called Prajuru Desa Adat Penglipuran. This institution consists of two parts, named Kanca Roras and Bendesa or Kelihan Adat.  1. Kanca Roras  Kanca Roras is a representative assembly with 12 members. Kanca Roras is taken from the word Ka-anca which means assigned and roras / rolas which means twelve. Kanca roras has a function resembling an assembly of representatives or a legislative body and its formation is based on the order of leadership in the name of the ulu-apad system.  2. Kelihan Adat  Kelihan Adat are people who are chosen and is an elder in the custom. Kelihan Adat are executive officials whose appointments are made through elections at a public meeting (kajudi ring paruman desa). Kelihan adat have a duty only if they are given a mandate from Kanca Roras.  Bamboo in Penglipuran Village  Bamboo from the Penglipuran Village is one of the best bamboo that can be found in Bali. The Penglipuran Village society believe that the bamboo forest does not grow by itself but rather planted by their ancestors. Therefore bamboo is considered a symbol of their historical roots. Bamboo forest that grow in the Penglipuran Village has an area of 37.7 hektare (previously 50 hektare) and consist of 15 bamboo species which are all owned by the village. Some of these forests are managed directly under the Adat Desa as a Laba Pura (for the maintenance of temple buildings) while some are managed by several residents with use rights status. Bamboo is also used by the people of Penglipuran village as a materials for building and housing. Here are some building that are built using bamboo as the materials : = 1. Pawon = This building functions as a kitchen in which there is a rice barn and a small place to rest. Pawon is built entirely using bamboo including roof, wall, bed, and even the tableware inside it. = 2. Bale Sakenem = Bale Sakenem is a place for religious ceremonies that are exclusive only for the family. The ceremony that is often performed at Bale Sakenem is ceremony of Pitra Yadnya (Ngaben) and Manusa Yadnya ceremony. This building uses bamboo as its roof. = 3. Bale Banjar = Bale Banjar is a building that can be used by all the people in Penglipuran Village. This village has no walls, only a support pillar and is used for mass Ngaben ceremonies and community gathering.  Penglipuran Village as a Tourist Place  Penglipuran is a village that still maintains their culture, traditions and bamboo forests in accordance with the principles of Tri Hita Karana. This then becomes an attraction for tourists to come to visit. Therefore, starting in 1993, the Balinese government promoted Penglipuran as a tourist destination. The Penglipuran community realizes their potential and applies \\"community-based-tourism\\" to avoid tourism capitalism in their village. With this concept, no individual will benefit directly from tourism because these benefits will be allocated for village development. Tourism actors such as tour guides, ticket guards and other officers will be directly employed by the village and get paid from the amount of profit earned, for example 40% of the total ticket sales. In addition, before the concept was implemented, the people of Penglipuran village were usually able to benefit by inviting tourists to their ‚Äúpekarangan‚Äù while explaining their traditions and culture. This is considered unfair because houses far from the main gate tend to get fewer opportunities. Therefore, through this new concept, all houses are given a number and the tour guide will provide a number with a rotating system to groups of tourists who come to visit. Each house is also given the opportunity to sell souvenirs in their Pekarangan by following their new concepts, for example 5,000 IDR from each sold souvenirs must be given back to support village development. Before 2012, due to poor accommodations, tourists only spent 10‚Äì20 minutes in the village but many tourists ask to stay to spend more time in the village. At that time they were still doubtful because tourists might be a threat to their culture and traditions. But after 2012, tourists are allowed to stay after debriefing on how to behave in accordance with tradition and culture. This was later considered to have a good impact because it could expand employment opportunities in the future.

Biography  In 1898, Reggini became a member of the Theosophical Society for which he founded a section in Rome. In 1903, he published in Palermo the first books of the editorial series named Biblioteca Teosofica (Theosophical Library) and later Biblioteca filosofica). In the same year, he was initiated in the Memphis' rite, a Masonic spiritual path that is derived by the ancient Egyptians and in Italy is uniquely practized in Palermo. In 1907, he was admitted to the regular Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge \\"Lucifero\\" in Florence, affiliated to the Grand Orient of Italy.Dedication to the \\"new brother Arturo Reghini, your G Papini\\". Cited in: Subsequently, Reghini adhered for a short period to the Martinism of G√©rard Encausse and started to report the errors of the lawyer and Grand Master Sacchi about his administration of the Italian Freemasonry, also confuting his publications. In 1907, Amedeo Rocco Armentano introduced Reghini to the knowledge of the Pythagorism. In 1912, Reghini was in directorate of the Italian Freemasonry (in Italian: Supremo Consiglio Universale of the Rito filosofico italianoRito filosofico italiano) from which he resigned in 1940 with a strongly negative judgement about the national brotherhood.Aniceto Del Massa, Pagine esoteriche, La Finestra, Trento, 2001, p. 46-47. In 1921, he was initiated to the 33rd and highest degree of the Scottish Rite. Then he was elected as effective member of the Supremo Consiglio d'Italia of which he became the Great Commendor and the General Secretary. In 1925, Reghini signed the internal decree No 245 related to its termination. Luigi Sessa, I Sovrani Grandi Commendatori e breve storia del Supremo Consiglio d'Italia del Rito scozzese antico ed accettato Palazzo Giustiniani dal 1805 ad oggi , Ed. Bastogi, Foggia, 2004, p. 11 On May 19, the Italian Parliament had approved the law of reform for the freedom of association, banning the masonic lodges out of the country. Reghini edited the journals Atan√≥r (1924) and Ignis (1925) devoted to initiate studies, covering topics such as Pythagoreanism, yoga, Hebrew Cabalism and the Freemasonry of Alessandro Cagliostro. A circle of esotericists formed around these journals and adopted the name Gruppo di Ur. The group's members included Julius Evola and the anthroposophists Giovanni Colazza and Giovanni Antonio Colonna di Cesar√≤. From 1927 to 1928 the group published the monthly journal UR. Reghini fell out with Evola and the Ur group in 1928; a major reason was Reghini's support for Freemasonry, which was not in line with the direction the journal had taken. Reghini left the editorial board and UR was discontinued. It was briefly replaced in 1929 by a journal named Krur, without Reghini's involvement. Reghini was opposed to Christianity, which he associated with modernity and egalitarianism, and sought to establish a form of modern Paganism he called \\"magia colta\\", \\"cultured magic\\", which he drew from Hermeticism and Platonism. A critic of democracy and an advocate for the ancient Roman aristocracy, Reghini welcomed the rise of Italian Fascism, which he associated with the ancient world. He wrote in Atan√≥r in 1924 that he had anticipated the emergence of such a regime in Italy 15 years prior.  Legacy  Reghini was an important influence on Evola during the years 1924 to 1930. He introduced Evola to the major texts on alchemy, which became the basis for Evola's book The Hermetic Tradition (1931). It was also through Reghini that Evola met Ren√© Gu√©non, whose Traditionalism would have a profound impact on his thinking. Reghini's journals and the works of the Ur group has influenced the development of Italic-Roman neopaganism and Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism.

Since 1977, she has been head of a law firm in Minden as a lawyer and notary. Since 1999, she has been president of the Richard Wagner Society in Minden. She received awards for her civic engagement as the driving force of the Wagner project at the Stadttheater Minden, particularly Der Ring in Minden, which brought her hometown to international recognition.  Life  Hering-Winckler's family was interested in Richard Wagner's work. Her grandfather had attended the premiere of the full Ring cycle, performed at the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, and her mother, Eva Hering, was a long-term treasurer of the Richard Wagner Society in Minden. Hering-Winckler has run a law firm in Minden since 1977. Beginning in 1999, when she became president of the Society, she initiated a series of productions of stageworks by Richard Wagner at the Stadttheater Minden in collaboration with the conductor Frank Beermann and the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie. The orchestra was positioned at the back of the stage of the small theatre, while the singers acted at the front of the stage, making an intimate approach to the dramatic situations possible. The first work presented was Der fliegende Holl√§nder in 2002, on the occasion of the Society's 90th anniversary. Wolfgang Wagner was the patron of the performance and attended it. It was followed by Tannh√§user in 2005, Lohengrin in 2009 and Tristan und Isolde in 2012. Hering-Winckler worked towards raising interest among the younger audience by supporting performances at schools and extending invitations to students to visit rehearsals. In 2015 the project known as Der Ring in Minden was launched, aiming to present the complete Der Ring des Nibelungen. It opened with Das Rheingold, followed a year later by Die Walk√ºre, in 2017 by Siegfried, and in 2018 by G√∂tterd√§mmerung. In 2019, the complete cycle was presented twice. Throughout the Wagner project, Frank Beermann conducted the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, a symphony orchestra which normally does not play for operas. The performances were attended and reviewed internationally, including by the Austrian Online Merker. Reviews by Eleonore B√ºning in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) compared the productions favourably with those of the Bayreuth Festival and noted that singers made their way to Bayreuth from Minden. The project was described as meeting Wagner's thought of the \\"birth of drama from the spirit of music\\" (\\"Geburt des Dramas aus dem Geist der Musik\\"), by singers who cultivate a \\"German belcanto\\" with clear diction. The project has been summarised as \\"Das Wunder Minden\\" (Minden Miracle). Hering-Winckler is regarded as the driving force who made it all possible, with contacts in the musical scene and to sponsors.  Awards  Hering-Winckler received the Ehrenring (Ring of Honour) of the City of Minden in recognition of her promotion of high-quality operatic events. The mayor said that she had made the impossible possible (\\"Sie haben das Unm√∂gliche m√∂glich gemacht\\"); she received congratulations from the Minister of Culture of North Rhine- Westphalia, Isabel Pfeiffer-Poensgen, and Wagner's great-granddaughter Eva Wagner-Pasquier, who represented the Bayreuth Festival.

Biography Fearnside was born in Berkeley, California, and has a bachelor's degree in biology at Colorado College. At the University of Michigan, he did his master's and PhD in the same area. He has worked especially on issues of tropical agro-ecosystems, deforestation, environmental degradation and their impact on society, sustainable development and climate change.XXXVI Congresso Brasileiro de Ci√™ncia do Solo. Philip Fearnside . Bel√©m do Par√°, 30/07-04/08/2017Academia Brasileira de Ci√™ncias. Philip Martin Fearnside . Philip has a large published bibliography, which includes studies that contributed to the increase of the knowledge about the fires, the capacity of human support in colonization areas, the rhythm, environmental causes and impacts of deforestation in the Amazon; for the development of techniques for sustainable management of nature, and for the renewal of methodologies for assessing greenhouse gas emissions, among other topics. Career He began his professional career as a graduate student, leaving for Asia as an agent of the Peace Corps, a technology and humanitarian aid body of the US government, operating between 1969 and 1971 in the state of Rajasthan, India, and also in China, as a consultant to local governments in the management of water resources. Returning to the United States, he finished his higher studies, intending to return later to India, but the beginning of an armed conflict caused him to direct his interests to the Amazon, installing in Brazil, where since 1978 he is a scientist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA), headquartered in Manaus, Brazil. For almost twenty years he has been a researcher at the Coordination of Research in Ecology at INPA. Since 1983, he has been deepening his studies on the impact of deforestation on the greenhouse effect, trying to highlight the economic, political and social importance of forest preservation, as well as its ecological importance. He has been an active voice in defending the Brazilian environment and alert to the dangers of deforestation and global warming. In 2003, Pesquisa Fapesp magazine published a story about the biologist and reported that \\"today, three decades after landing in the region, Fearnside accumulates field experience - even lived in villages along the Trans- Amazonian Highway to do his doctorate - and scientific knowledge about the Amazon rarely found in Brazilians [...] His name is an international reference in many of the themes that make the great tropical forest an important and controversial subject, such as the possible relation between forest deforestation and climate change on the planet and the impact of the implementation of roads, dams and agricultural projects in the region. For his work in favor of sustainable development against offensive projects to the environment, such as the construction of the Balbina Dam power plant in the 1980s, he is often challenged by supporters of progress.\\"O amigo da floresta\\" .

The plan requires scientists and researchers who benefit from state-funded research organisations and institutions to publish their work in open repositories or in journals that are available to all by 2021. The \\"S\\" stands for \\"shock\\".  Principles of the plan  The plan is structured around ten principles. The key principle states that by 2021, research funded by public or private grants must be published in open-access journals or platforms, or made immediately available in open access repositories without an embargo. The ten principles are: # authors should retain copyright on their publications, which must be published under an open license such as Creative Commons; # the members of the coalition should establish robust criteria and requirements for compliant open access journals and platforms; # they should also provide incentives for the creation of compliant open access journals and platforms if they do not yet exist; # publication fees should be covered by the funders or universities, not individual researchers; # such publication fees should be standardized and capped; # universities, research organizations, and libraries should align their policies and strategies; # for books and monographs, the timeline may be extended beyond 2021; # open archives and repositories are acknowledged for their importance; # hybrid open-access journals are not compliant with the key principle; # members of the coalition should monitor and sanction non- compliance.  Specific implementation guidance  Diagram of Plan S requirements (January 2019) A task force of Science Europe, lead by John-Arne R√∏ttingen (RCN) and David Sweeney (UKRI), has developed a specific implementation guidance on the Plan S principles, released on 27 November 2018. The development of the implementation guidance also drew on input from interested parties such as research institutions, researchers, universities, funders, charities, publishers, and civil society. = Transition period = During a transition period, publishing in a hybrid journal that is covered by a transformative agreement to become a full open-access venue will remain permissible. The contracts of such transformative agreements need to be made publicly available (including costs), and may not last beyond 2023. = Green open access = Publishing in any journal will continue to be permissible subject to the condition that a copy of the manuscript accepted by the journal, or the final published article, will be deposited in an approved open-access repository (green open access) with no embargo on access and with a CC-BY licence. As part of the Rights retention strategy, Coalition S plans to override journal policies that would forbid this. = Licensing and rights = To re-use scholarly content, proper attribution needs to be given to the authors, and publications need to be granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non- exclusive, irrevocable license to share and adapt the work for any purpose, including commercially. Scholarly articles must be published under a Creative Commons Attribution license CC BY 4.0, or alternatively CC BY-SA 4.0 Share- alike or CC0 Public Domain. = Mandatory criteria for open access journals and platforms = Open access journals and platforms need to meet the following criteria to be compliant with Plan S: * All scholarly content must be immediately accessible upon publication without any delay and free to read and download, without any kind of technical or other form of obstacles. * Content needs to be published under CC BY, CC BY-SA or CC0. * The journal/platform must implement and document a solid review system according to the standards within the discipline, and according to the standards of the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE). * The journal/platform must be listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) or be in the state of being registered. * Automatic article processing charge waivers for authors from low-income countries and discounts for authors from middle-income countries must be provided. * Details about publishing costs (including direct costs, indirect costs and potential surplus) impacting the publication fees must be made transparent and be openly available on the journal website/publishing platform. * DOIs must be used as permanent identifiers. * Long-term digital preservation strategy by deposition of content in an archiving programme such as LOCKSS/CLOCKSS. * Accessibility of the full text in a machine readable format (e.g. XML / JATS) to foster Text and Data Mining (TDM). * Link to raw data and code in external repositories. * Provide high quality and machine readable article level metadata and cited references under a CC0 public domain dedication. * Embed machine readable information on the open access status and the license of the article. Mirror journals, with one part being subscription based and the other part being open access, are considered to be de facto hybrid journals. Mirror journals are not compliant with Plan S unless they are a part of a transformative agreement. = Public feedback = The implementation guidance was open for general feedback until 8 February 2019. On 31 May 2019 the cOAlition S published an updated version of their implementation guidance in light of the feedback received during the consultation.  COAlition S  Some commentators have suggested that the adoption of Plan S in one region would encourage its adoption in other regions. = Member organisations = Organisations in the coalition behind Plan S include: *Austria: Austrian Science Fund; *Finland: Academy of Finland; *France: Agence nationale de la recherche; *Ireland: Science Foundation Ireland; *Italy: Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare; *Luxembourg: ; *Netherlands: Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research; *Norway: Research Council of Norway; *Poland: National Science Centre; *Slovenia: ; *Sweden: ;Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (Forte); Vinnova. *Jordan: Higher Council for Science and Technology *United Kingdom: United Kingdom Research and Innovation; Wellcome Trust *United States: Gates Foundation; Howard Hughes Medical Institute * Zambia: National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) International organizations that are members: * Aligning Science Against Parkinson Plan S is also supported by: * European Commission, * World Health Organization = Public figures = Professor Johan Rooryck of Leiden University was appointed Open Access Champion by cOAlition S on 28 August 2019; he replaced Robert-Jan Smits, who stepped down in March 2019. = Organisations that withdrew or declined to join = In October 2018 the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) made it clear that US federal funders would not be signing up to Plan S. In an interview with the American Institute of Physics published 30 April 2019, OSTP Director Kelvin Droegemeier stated with regard to Plan S: \\"One of the things this government will not do is to tell researchers where they have to publish their papers. That is absolutely up to the scholar who's doing the publication. There's just no question about that.\\" Swedish Riksbank's Jubileee Fond (RJ) used to be a member, but left the coalition after concerns about the timelines of Plan S. On 25 October 2019, Vijay Raghavan announced that India would not be joining cOAlition S, despite his supportive comments earlier in the same year. The European Research Council initially supported Coalition S, but withdrew support in July 2020.

Springer Nature \\"urge[d] research funding agencies to align rather than act in small groups in ways that are incompatible with each other, and for policymakers to also take this global view into account\\", adding that removing publishing options from researchers \\"fails to take this into account and potentially undermines the whole research publishing system\\". The AAAS, publisher of the journal Science, argued that Plan S \\"will not support high-quality peer-review, research publication and dissemination\\", and that its implementation \\"would disrupt scholarly communications, be a disservice to researchers, and impinge academic freedom\\" and \\"would also be unsustainable for the Science family of journals\\". Tom Reller of Elsevier said, \\"if you think that information should be free of charge, go to Wikipedia\\". On 12 September 2018 UBS repeated their \\"sell\\" advice on Elsevier (RELX) stocks. Elsevier's share price fell by 13% between 28 Aug and 19 September 2018. On 28 November 2018 the journal Epidemiology and Infection published by Cambridge University Press announced that it would convert to the open access model of publication from 1 January 2019, citing changed funder policies and Plan S. According to the Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association (OASPA), whose aim is to transform the business model of the largest publishers (by supporting projects like Project DEAL), Plan S puts smaller and emerging fully open access publishers at a competitive disadvantage, and potentially harms their prospects. Pure \\"gold\\" open access publishers may be put out of business by incentivizing authors to publish with large publishers which have the market power to negotiate their transition plans with funders, while no incentives are provided to authors to publish with smaller fully open access publishers and scholarly societies. On 8 April 2020, Springer Nature announced that many of its journals, including Nature, would become compatible with Plan S by publishing open access articles from 2021 and committing to an eventual transition to full open access. = Various reactions = Reactions included an Open Letter, signed by more than 1790 researchers, expressing their concerns about perceived unintended outcomes of the Plan if implemented as stated before the publication of the specific implementation guidance.Open Letter from Undersigned Researchers. Reaction of Researchers to Plan S: Too Far, Too Risky. Retrieved 15 November 2018. Another Open Letter in support of mandatory open access was issued after the publication of the specific implementation guide, and had been signed by over 1,900 researchers by the end of 2018. However, it did not reference Plan S specifically.Open Letter in Support of Funder Open Publishing Mandates. Retrieved 1 January 2019. Stephen Curry, a structural biologist and open access advocate at Imperial College London, called the policy a \\"significant shift\\" and \\"a very powerful declaration\\". Ralf Schimmer, head of the Scientific Information Provision at the Max Planck Digital Library, told The Scientist that \\"This will put increased pressure on publishers and on the consciousness of individual researchers that an ecosystem change is possible ... There has been enough nice language and waiting and hoping and saying please. Research communities just aren't willing to tolerate procrastination anymore.\\" Political activist George Monbiot ‚Äì while acknowledging that the plan was \\"not perfect\\" ‚Äì wrote in The Guardian that the publishers' responses to Plan S was \\"ballistic\\", and argued that Elsevier's response regarding Wikipedia \\"inadvertently remind[ed] us of what happened to the commercial encyclopedias\\". He said that, until Plan S is implemented, \\"The ethical choice is to read the stolen material published by Sci-Hub.\\" On 25 October 2018, the Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities (DARIAH) endorsed the main ambitions set out by the Plan S, namely the elimination of paywalls, copyright retention, and the rejection of hybrid models of open access publishing. DARIAH published recommendations for the practical implementation of the principles of the Plan S. DARIAH perceived a strong bias toward the STEM perspective within the current principles of Plan S, and called for a broader range of publication funding mechanisms to better cover the situation for researchers in the arts and humanities. DARIAH was established as a European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC) in August 2014 and had 17 member countries and several cooperating partners in eight non-member countries. Further detailed recommendations for the implementation of Plan S were published on 19 October 2018 by the board of the Fair Open Access Alliance (FOAA). On 7 September 2018 the European University Association (EUA) published a statement in which it generally welcomed the Plan's ambitions to turn open access into reality by 2020, but stated that, while the plan developed a bold vision for the transition, it hinged on turning principles into practice. On 26 March 2019, the OA2020 Mainland China signatory libraries held a meeting at the National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing at which they clarified their position with regard to Plan S.

Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res was the daughter of Charles de Contay, senechal du Maine, and Barbe de Hallwin, and married the courtier Jean d'Humi√®res (d. 1550) in 1507. She inherited the lordship of Contay from her father, and became Dame de Contay. In 1546, she and her spouse where appointed governor and governess to the Dauphin, and subsequently became the main governor and governess to all the children of king Henry II of France and Catherine de Medici. The royal children were raised under their direct supervision, under the orders of Diane de Poitiers. As head governor and governess, the d'Humi√®res couple headed the staff of the royal nursery, staff of about 250 people, which included tutors and governesses of lower rank, who attended more directly to each of the children. Among them was notably Marie- Catherine Gondi, who served as sub-governess. The royal children where mainly raised away from the rest of the court on Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, and when the royal court visited Saint Germain, the nursery was sent to Ch√¢teau de Blois or Ch√¢teau d'Amboise. From 1548, the nursery was expanded to include Mary, Queen of Scots and her governess (Janet Stewart, Lady Fleming, later Fran√ßoise de Paroy) and personal Scottish entourage of about 30 people. When her spouse died in 1550, he was succeeded as governor by Claude d'Urf√©, who was given charge of the finances of the royal nursery, but the king confirmed Fran√ßoise d'Humi√®res as main governess with the responsibility for his children.

Crocker platted the village in 1863, and attracted a number of settlers to the area. This building to the area by the mill with the basic necessities of life. This commercial building was constructed in Otisville in 1884, and was used at various times by the Parker and Dunstan partnership as a hardware or general store, and by Dr. E. D. Lewis as a drugstore. The building has apparently been demolished at some point after the early 1980s. Description The Parker and Dunstan Hardware Building was a two-story brick Italianate commercial brick structure. It had pressed metal cornice with brackets, and an unaltered storefront facade, three stores wide, complete with cast iron support columns, multi-paned display windows, and wood-framed entryways. The existence of such an unaltered commercial facade is rare.

Originating from a tropical wave over West Africa, Florence quickly organized upon its emergence over the Atlantic Ocean. Favorable atmospheric conditions enabled it to develop into a tropical depression on August 31 just south of the Cape Verde islands. Intensifying to a tropical storm the following day, Florence embarked on a west-northwest to northwest trajectory over open ocean. Initially being inhibited by increased wind shear and dry air, the small cyclone took advantage of a small area of low shear and warm waters. After achieving hurricane strength early on September 4, Florence underwent an unexpected period of rapid deepening through September 5, culminating with it becoming a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Thereafter, conditions again became unfavorable and the hurricane quickly diminished to a tropical storm on September 7. From September 7‚Äì9, Florence's forward momentum slowed as it turned west. Favorable conditions again fostered intensification on September 9 and the system regained hurricane status. Turning northwest toward the United States, a second phase of rapid intensification ensued that day into September 10 with Florence regaining Category 4 strength. It subsequently reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.67 inHg). Steady weakening occurred over the following days as steering currents began to collapse. The hurricane slowed to a crawl by September 13 as it approached North Carolina. Torrential rains began affecting the state on this day and persisted through September 17. Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach on September 14 with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). With the system remaining close to the coastline it weakened slowly, eventually degrading to a tropical depression on September 16. Training rainbands produced prolific, record-breaking rainfall across North and South Carolina throughout this period. Catastrophic flooding and extensive wind damage ensued, resulting in 22 direct fatalities and 30 indirect deaths across the Carolinas and Virginia. Florence later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 17 before dissipating the following day. Origins On August 28, 2018, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring a tropical wave--an elongated area of low air pressure--over West Africa for possible tropical cyclogenesis over the subsequent five days as it progressed west. Development into a tropical cyclone became increasingly likely the following day; and a more defined low coalesced along the coast of Senegal on August 30. On this day, the system split in two, with the northern one ultimately developing into Florence and the southern portion later becoming Tropical Depression Nineteen-E in the Eastern Pacific. Favorable environmental conditions, including ample moisture and low wind shear, enabled further organization and development of broad shower and thunderstorm activity. Lacking a well-defined center but posing an immediate threat to Cape Verde, the NHC began issuing advisories on the system as Potential Tropical Cyclone Six later that day. Easterly trade winds propelled the disturbance along a west to west-northwest trajectory. Through much of the day and into August 31, convection remained confined to the southwest of the disturbance within a monsoon trough and precluded its classification as a tropical cyclone. Toward the end of August 31, convective organization became sufficient for the NHC to mark the formation of Tropical Depression Six as the system passed south of Santiago in Cape Verde. By September 1, the primary steering factor shifted to a strong, expansive subtropical ridge anchored well to the north. This ridge extended from Europe to the eastern United States and remained the dominant steering factor through much of the storm's history. Moderate wind shear temporarily stunted development and displaced convection to the eastern side of the depression. Pronounced banding features surrounded the circulation and the depression intensified to a tropical storm; accordingly the NHC assigned the system the name Florence. Satellite intensity estimates indicated Florence achieved maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) by 09:00 UTC on September 2. Thereafter, shear and entrainment of dry air displaced convection from the surface low, leaving it exposed. Considerable uncertainty in the forecast for Florence arose, as weather models began to depict various solutions. Fluctuations in organization and intensity continued through September 3. Unexpected intensification Development of a small central dense overcast and a mid-level eye feature signified that Florence achieved hurricane strength early on September 4, roughly 1,240 miles (2,000 km) west-northwest of the Cape Verde islands. Broad-scale conditions‚Äîmoderate wind shear, sea surface temperatures below , and low relative humidity values‚Äîdid not favor further intensification. However, these conditions were averaged over a large area and did not accurately represent localized conditions in the vicinity of Florence. The compact system unexpectedly rapidly organized within a small area of low wind shear. The hurricane's core structure and outer banding improved markedly, catching forecasters off-guard and intensifying beyond model outputs. In stark contrast to model guidance, Florence continued to intensify and attained major hurricane status around 12:00 UTC on September 5. Sustained winds rose to 130 mph (215 km/h) and its pressure fell to 950 mbar (hPa; 28.05 inHg); this ranked it as a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. Situated at , Florence became the northernmost Category 4 hurricane east of 50¬∞W. The hurricane's unforeseen intensification caused it to track farther north, out of the localized low shear. Persistent shear finally took its toll on Florence on September 6 through September 7, causing convection to become asymmetrical and tilting the storm's core southwest to northeast. By the early hours of September 7, rapid degradation of Florence's structure occurred. Its low-level circulation became exposed as convection became displaced to the northeast and the previously well-defined eye dissipated. Scatterometer data revealed the system weakened to tropical storm intensity by 00:00 UTC. Meteorologist Robbie Berg described the intensity forecasts for Florence as a \\"self-defeating prophecy\\" owing to the \\"nuances of the environmental shear\\". A building mid-level ridge halted Florence's northward movement, leading to a slow westward turn. Weather models became increasingly consistent on the storm's future track, leading to greater confidence in a major impact to the Southeastern United States. This threat was enhanced by the downstream effects of Typhoon Jebi's extratropical remnant influencing a ridge off the eastern United States which, in turn, forced a trough away from Florence faster than initially anticipated. This trajectory proved climatologically unusual, with United States hurricane impacts primarily originating farther south and west of Florence's position on that day. United States approach Environmental conditions became increasingly conducive to reorganization on September 8 as NOAA Hurricane Hunters began reconnaissance of the cyclone. Convective banding blossomed around the storm and a formative eye appeared on satellite imagery. The storm's central dense overcast became more defined and a complete eyewall developed within its core. Florence reattained hurricane-status around 12:00 UTC on September 9, with the Hurricane Hunters observing sustained winds at the surface. Fueled by sea surface temperatures of , Florence rapidly intensified overnight. Convective bursts with frequent lightning surrounded the eyewall, giving rise to a well- defined wide eye. Expanding outflow ventilated the cyclone, enabling continued growth. The system rapidly achieved Category 4 intensity by 16:00 UTC, with reconnaissance aircraft recording surface winds near 130 mph (215 km/h) and a pressure of 946 mbar (hPa; 27.93 inHg). The hurricane's motion accelerated and shifted northwest by this time, a trajectory it would maintain for several days. Hurricane Florence as seen from the alt=A photograph of a hurricane from space. The storm features a large eye and sprawling, curving cloud cover. Hurricane Florence achieved its initial peak intensity late on September 10 with sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a pressure of 940 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg). The extent of hurricane-force winds doubled in size and well- defined mesovortices rotated along the inner eyewall. Slight weakening ensued thereafter as an eyewall replacement cycle started; convection surrounding the eyewall became ragged and the eye itself filled. This process completed the following day, with the newly formed eye spanning 35 mi (55 km) across. Extensive outflow became established over the cyclone, extending northwest and east, providing ample ventilation and deformation which enabled Florence to continue expanding. The system intensified again and reached its peak intensity with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and a pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.76 inHg) at 18:00 UTC. The future track of the hurricane became increasingly complex as it approached the Carolinas. A strengthening trough moving inland over the Pacific Northwest amplified ridging over the Northeastern United States and western Atlantic Ocean, steering Florence to the west-northwest. A collapse of steering currents was anticipated around the time of landfall on September 14, which would result in the hurricane meandering near the coast or just inland for a prolonged period of time. Fluctuations in the organization of Florence continued through the remainder of September 11 into September 12. Environmental conditions remained highly favorable for intensification and the NHC forecast the system to strengthen just below Category 5 status by September 13; however, the system soon weakened and degraded to Category 3 status by 18:00 UTC. Florence steadily grew in size during this time, with tropical storm-force winds extending 195 mi (315 km) by the end of September 12. The hurricane's core soon unraveled on September 13 as mid-level wind shear increased and upwelling of colder water reduced available energy. The hurricane's eyewall eroded entirely along the south side and convection became disrupted. Reconnaissance data revealed an ongoing eyewall replacement cycle, with a 25‚Äì35 mi (35‚Äì55 km) wide inner-core and 60‚Äì70 mi (95‚Äì110 km) wide outer-core. Furthermore, sustained surface winds fell to an estimated 110 mph (175 km/h), marking the cessation of Florence's tenure as a major hurricane. Landfall and dissipation NEXRAD animation of Hurricane Florence on September 13‚Äì14 as it made landfall in North Carolina The outer rainbands of Hurricane Florence began affecting North Carolina during the latter half of September 13. Ample atmospheric moisture combined with strong upward lift from the anticyclone atop Florence yielded an environment conducive to widespread torrential precipitation. NEXRAD radar data from Morehead City indicated rainfall rates of per hour within these bands. Florence's forward motion slowed throughout the day as the ridge steering it northwest built ahead of the cyclone toward the Appalachian Mountains. The previously disrupted eye rejuvenated; however, wind speeds within the storm continued to decrease. Additional fluctuations in the hurricane's core resulted in erratic movement, including a brief stalling period approximately 100 mi (155 km) east-southeast of Wilmington. By 21:00 UTC, sustained hurricane-force winds reached the North Carolina coastline. Trudging west, the eye of Florence ultimately made landfall near Wrightsville Beach at 11:15 UTC on September 14 as a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) and a central pressure of 956 mbar (hPa; 28.23 inHg). As the hurricane moved ashore, deep convection blossomed along the eastern side of Florence's core. A strong inflow band became established within this area, resulting in localized heavy rain along the Crystal Coast. Rainfall rates within the western eyewall reached an estimated per hour while widespread accumulations of per hour fell within the eastern band. A rain gage in Swansboro indicated accumulations of by 14:34 UTC, exceeding radar estimations. Consistent flooding rains impacted Carteret County, prompting a flash flood emergency by this time. Although the hurricane continued its slow movement west, the rain band gradually propagated east resulting in no net movement. Early on September 15, this band remained situated over Onslow, Carteret, Jones, Lenoir, and Wayne counties. A new rain band developed closer to the storm's core over New Hanover, Brunswick, Pender, Bladen, and Sampson counties. Catastrophic flash flooding from these bands ensued throughout the day, washing out roads and prompting water rescues. A Weather Prediction Center analysis of precipitable water at 20:20 UTC on September 14; values peaked at near Morehead City, North Carolina. The magenta-shaded areas in eastern North Carolina indicate catastrophic flooding at the time of the graphic. Although the center of Florence progressed inland over South Carolina, offshore convective available potential energy values of 1,000‚Äì2,000 J/kg and strong mid-level winds continued fueling the aforementioned rainbands. A low-risk of tornadoes accompanied the heavy rain across North Carolina. Minimal diabatic heating stemming from the hurricane's lack of a thermal gradient kept the threat of tornadic storms low, with the primary driving force being ample atmospheric moisture. Small-scale training supercells‚Äîseries of severe storms that continuously develop, track across, and dissipate over the same areas‚Äîdeveloped between Morehead City and Wilmington during the overnight hours of September 14‚Äì15. Record flooding ensued along the Cape Fear, Northeast Cape Fear, Lumber, and Waccamaw rivers; nine USGS river gauges observed all-time crests. Flooding persisted along multiple rivers for more than a week after the storm. Approximately 86,000 homes across North and South Carolina were flooded or otherwise damaged. Total damage between the two states reached an estimated $24 billion, ranking Florence as the ninth-costliest hurricane in United States' history. Florence weakened below hurricane strength by 00:00 UTC on September 15. Its close proximity to the coastline enabled it to maintain its organization and only slowly degrade. Throughout the majority of the day intense rainbands persisted over southern North Carolina, with six-hourly accumulations averaging in two bands extending from Brunswick to Bladen counties and Pender to Sampson counties. Aided by an anticyclone, this band stretched across 350 mi (565 km) along the eastern side of Florence. The heaviest rains shifted to South Carolina early on September 16; estimated rainfall rates reached per hour in Dillon, Marion, and Marlboro counties. The system finally weakened to a tropical depression over South Carolina by 18:00 UTC on September 16, more than two days after it made landfall. Florence accelerated north along the western edge of the ridge previously steering it west. It eventually became extratropical over West Virginia on September 17. Heavy rains propagated north along with the circulation center; however, rainbands extended from Virginia to South Carolina through September 17 with a narrow band of convection pivoting along the eastern slopes of the Appalachian Mountains. An approaching frontal system caused the remnant system to accelerate east, and ultimately resulted in its dissipation over Massachusetts on September 18. Precipitation gradually subsided as the system weakened and the flooding threat lessened accordingly. Moderate rain with localized areas of heavy precipitation extended into Pennsylvania, New York, and southern New England on September 18.

Founded in 1846, Dallas County Schools offered full service and/or supplemental student transportation services to other government entities, school districts, charter schools and private schools in and around Dallas County, Texas as well as a part in Denton County. DCS also served select school districts in Parker and Tarrant Counties under its d.b.a. name TexServe. DCS was one of the top student transportation fleets in the nation and operated a fleet of approximately 2,000 buses that transported more than 75,000 children to and from school safely each day. Corruption Scandal and Downfall DCS went bust amid a complicated corruption scheme involving stop-arm camera contracts with Force Multiplier Solutions and its CEO, Robert Leonard. Part of the scheme, according to court papers, involved Leonard bribing officials and DCS spending millions on cameras from Leonard‚Äôs company. An estimated 3,000 of the 7,000 cameras went unused or barely used. Many of them are stored in a warehouse at a bus service center in southeast Dallas. As DCS hemorrhaged millions in taxpayer dollars, its superintendent, Dr. Rick Sorrells, agreed to a lease-buy back scheme involving four of its bus service centers. Sorrells sold the property for $25 million (USD), and agreed to lease it at a cost of $46 million (USD). In 2017, Weatherford ISD voted to terminate its contract with DCS, which started in August 2016, citing that they're planning their own in- house transportation to their students.

Production The series was produced by host Jonathan Ross's own production company, Channel X, headed by Kenton Allen. Unlike previous shows, Ross specifically designed it to be \\"a show that I want to watch\\" without being particularly interested in viewing figures or popularity. The show was broadcast live, with no possibility for re-takes or editing. Writers for the series included Kevin Day and Patrick Marber. The music director and keyboard player was Janette Mason, who also wrote the show's theme tune. Guests The series had a number of high-profile guests, including supermodel Naomi Campbell who appeared on the first episode. Other guests included Kylie Minogue, Danny DeVito, Christopher Walken and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Penn & Teller also performed, making their first live appearance on a UK television programme. Musical guests included former Dexys Midnight Runners frontman Kevin Rowland, Del Amitri, Suzanne Vega, Stereo MCs and P.M. Dawn, and k.d. lang performed her recent hit single, \\"Constant Craving\\". The show featured the first appearance on television of Steve Coogan's character Paul Calf, and helped launch the career of political comedian Mark Thomas. Rowland Rivron and Graham Fellows (performing in-character as John Shuttleworth) made regular appearances on the show. The Fast Show Simon Day featured in several sketches. Critical reception Saturday Zoo was not well received by critics, who focused on Ross's omnipresence on television at the time. The Daily Mail Jack Tinker delivered a scathing critique of the show, saying \\"I sat in mounting bewilderedness last weekend trying to discover any sign of recognisable human intellect\\", while a review in The Independent described Ross as \\"humour- resistant Teflon\\". It was subsequently viewed as stalling Ross's high-profile career.

Whitesides alias Prewitt (1 Mo. 472, 1824 WL 1839 [1824]) was the first freedom suit heard by the Supreme Court of Missouri. The case established the state's judicial criteria for an enslaved person's right to freedom. The court determined that if a slave owner took a slave into free territory and established residence there, the slave would be free. The slave remained free even if returned to slave territory, engendering the phrase \\"once free, always free.\\" For two decades, the \\"once free, always free\\" precedent was upheld in a number of freedom suits. Territorial Law Winny filed suit in 1818, basing her claim on the laws of two U.S. territories, the Northwest Territory and the Louisiana Territory (renamed the Missouri Territory when the State of Louisiana joined the Union in 1812). The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established laws prohibiting slavery in the Northwest Territory, the region north of the Ohio River comprising the present-day states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Article 6 of the ordinance declares, \\"There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted: Provided, always, That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.\\" The Laws of the Territory of Louisiana included \\"an act to enable persons held in slavery, to sue for their freedom\\" and a process for achieving that end.(Chapter 35, Freedom, June 27, 1807) \\"1. It shall be lawful for any person held in slavery to petition the general court or any court of common pleas, praying that such person may be permitted to sue as a poor person, and stating the grounds on which the claim to freedom is founded...\\" \\"2. The court to whom application is thus made, may direct an action of assault and battery, and false imprisonment, to be instituted in the name of the person claiming freedom against the person who claims the petitioner as a slave...\\" \\"3. If the court, or any judge thereof in vacation shall have reason to believe that the above order has been or is about to be violated, in such case the said court, or any judge thereof in vacation, may require that the person of the petitioner be brought before him or them, by writ of habeas corpus, and shall cause the defendant or defendants, his, her, or their agent to enter into recognizance with sufficient security, conditioned as recited in the above order, or in case of refusal to direct the sheriff of the district to take possession of the petitioner, and hire hi or her to the best advantage, which hire shall be appropriated either to the petitioner, or to the defendant or defendants, as the event of the suit may justify... \\"4. The court before whom such a suit may be tried, may instruct the jury that the weight of proof lies on the petitioner, but to have regard not only to the written evidences to claim of freedom, but to such other proofs either at law or in equity as the very right and justice as the case may require. And the court on a verdict in favor of the petitioner, may pronounce a judgement of liberation from the defendant or defendants, and all persons claiming by, from, or under, him, her, or them.\\" \\"5. Suits instituted in any court of common pleas under this law, may be removed into the general court before judgement, or if judgement is given in any such cause in the court of common pleas, appeal, or writ of error shall lie to the general court as in other cases.\\" Winny's Suit Winny v. Whitesides freedom petition (1819) In 1794 or 1795, Phebe Whitesides and her husband lived in the Carolinas with a slave about 12 years of age called Winny. When the Whitesides moved to Illinois, then part of the Northwest Territory, they took Winny with them. The couple resided in Illinois for three or four years, retaining the girl in slavery. The Whitesides then moved to St. Louis, Missouri, once more bringing Winny with them and still holding her as a slave. Winny filed suit to obtain her freedom from Mrs. Whitesides (Mr. Whitesides had died) in the Superior Court of Missouri Territory in 1818. When Missouri entered statehood, the case was transferred to the Circuit Court of St. Louis County. The court assumed the Whitesides had held Winny as a slave in Missouri for about 20 years, at which time she petitioned for her liberty. The records do not explain why she waited to sue or what caused her to sue when she did. Winny's claim against Phebe Whitesides was ‚Äúassault and battery.‚Äù The term did not necessarily connote that Whitesides had been physically abusive, but meant that Whitesides was restraining Winny in an unlawful way, i.e. ‚Äúunlawful imprisonment.‚Äù Whitesides refused liability on the grounds that Winny was her slave. She admitted to \\"imprisoning\\" Winny, but claimed the imprisonment was not unlawful, but justified since Winny was not free. Winny challenged this defense. A jury trial began in February 1822. Winny‚Äôs case centered on her assertion that residence in the Northwest Territory had conferred her freedom. Whitesides‚Äô attorney asked that the jury be instructed Winny‚Äôs residence in Illinois ‚Äúdid not render the said Winny free, under and by virtue of the ordinance of Congress of 1787.‚Äù The trial judge refused to give this instruction. Instead, he told the jury that if they believed the Whitesides resided in Illinois, with the intention of making the place their home, they should find for Winny and award damages to her as they would to any plaintiff in an action of false imprisonment. The jury returned a verdict in Winny's favor and awarded her damages of $167.50. Whitesides' Appeal Phebe Whitesides appealed the judgment to the Supreme Court of Missouri, which heard the case in late 1824. Her argument consisted of three parts: First, through the Articles of Confederation, \\"the [Continental] Congress had no power, either to purchase the said Territory, or to forbid, by law, that slaves should be held in that Territory.‚Äù Second, even if Winny had been free in the Northwest Territory, she had not sued for her freedom or been declared free there. For 20 years, Winny had been a resident of Missouri a slave territory and state. According to Whitesides‚Äô counsel, her right of ownership \\"revived so soon as the slave was found in Missouri, unless the slave had, while residing there [in the Northwest Territory], asserted and obtained his freedom by the process of law.‚Äù Counsel also argued concerning the willingness of the court of one jurisdiction to recognize and apply the law of another. A Missouri court, adjudicating the rights of Missouri residents, need not and should not apply the law of the Northwest Territory or Illinois. Third, the Northwest Ordinance simply provided that there would not be slavery in the Northwest Territory. It did not state \\"that the slaves of persons settling in that country . . . thereby become free. The Court's Decision The three-member court, Justice Mathias McGirk, Judge George Tompkins and Judge Rufus Pettibone unanimously found in Winny's favor. Tompkins wrote the decision. As to the first argument, Tompkins conceded the Continental Congress might not have had the power, under the Articles of Confederation, to create the Northwest Territory, but declared that issue moot. As to the laws governing the region, the Constitution of 1789, \\"expressly placed this power of regulating the Territory where alone it could be exercised, in the Congress.‚Äù He noted that rules regulating the Territory included laws concerning slavery, ‚ÄúTo acquire property is incident to sovereignty; so it is to make rules for the disposition and regulation thereof. To us it appears most manifest that Congress had both power to acquire the Territory, and to forbid the introduction of slaves.‚Äù Addressing Whitesides' second point, Tompkins rejected the assumption that the Northwest Territory was akin to a separate nation, asserting it was the property of the states and subject to the laws enacted by those states. Even in situations involving different countries, he opined, ‚Äúpersonal rights and disabilities, obtained or communicated by the laws of any particular place, are of a nature which accompany the person wherever he goes.‚Äù Assuming Winny had gained her freedom in the Northwest Territory, she retained that right, regardless of whether or not she sought or obtained a court decree confirming her status. \\"If, by a residence in Illinois, [Mrs. Whitesides] lost her right to the property in the defendant, that right was not revived by a removal of the parties to Missouri.‚Äù An astonished Tompkins continued, \\"We did not suppose that any person could mistake the policy of Congress in making this provision. When the States assumed the right of self-government they found their citizens claiming a right of property in a miserable portion of the human race. Sound national policy required that the evil should be restricted as much as possible. What they could, they did. They said, by their representatives, it shall not vest within these limits, and by their acts for nearly half a century they have approved and sanctioned this declaration.\\" The justice did, however, dinstnguish between residence and transit. Freedom attached if the master brought the slave into free territory with the intent of residing there, but did not if master and slave simply passed through the territory. \\"The sovereign power of the United States has declared that 'neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist' there; and this court thinks that the person who takes his slave into said territory, and by the length of his residence there indicates an intention of making that place his residence and that of his slave, and thereby induces a jury to believe that fact, does, by such residence, declare his slave to have become a free man. But it has been urged that by such a construction of the ordinance every person traveling through the territory, and taking along with him his slave, might thereby lose his property in his slave. We do not think the instructions of the Circuit Court can be, by any fair construction, strained so far; nor do we believe that any advocate for this portion of the species ever seriously calculated on the possibility of such a decision.\\" Significance At the end of 1824, the Missouri General Assembly passed a law providing a process for enslaved persons to sue for freedom and have some protections in the process. The years between 1824 and 1844 are considered the \\"golden age\\" of freedom suits since many slaves won their freedom during these years. Winny v. Whitesides set the standard for determining freedom cases up until the 1850s. Under its guidance, the courts of Missouri and Kentucky ruled in favor of slaves in most cases. Many of the successful petitions originated in St. Louis County. Between 1806 and 1865, in the City of St. Louis alone, nearly 300 enslaved individuals took legal action against their masters in a fight for freedom. Notable cases include Merry v. Tiffin & Menard, LaGrange v. Chouteau, Theoteste alias Catiche v. Chouteau, Julia v. McKinney, Wilson v. Melvin and Rachel v. Walker. The \\"once free, always free\\" precedent was overturned by the Missouri Supreme Court in Dred Scott v. Irene Emerson (1852) and the resulting U.S. Supreme Court decision in Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857). Very few slaves pressed successful suits after 1852.

The Lubee Foundation was created by Luis F. Bacardi of the Bacardi spirits company. The name \\"Lubee\\" was derived from the name of \\"Luis Bacardi.\\" In the early years of the organization, it was home to several animal species other than bats, such as parrots, monkeys, and ostriches. The Lubee Foundation was used as a temporary holding facility for animals on their way to Disney's Animal Kingdom. The Bacardi family and business had a special interest in bats, as bats were the inspiration for its logo. When Luis Bacardi died on 12 September 1991, the Lubee Foundation shifted emphasis to focus on bats, rehoming its non-bat species. Facilities Lubee Bat Conservancy is situated on a ranch, approximately north of the city of Gainesville, Florida. It has facilities designed for the maintenance of captive bats, with temperature-controlled areas for roosting and outdoor flight enclosures. It also has medical equipment to manage the bats' needs, such as an examination room equipped for anesthesia, isolation areas, and a recovery room. Species housed Lubee Bat Conservancy is home to more than 200 megabats of several species.

Early life and rise to fame Born in Madalena, Vila Nova de Gaia, into a poor family, Santos, along with his four siblings, became fatherless when he was still a child. Due to his mental development difficulties, Santos was accompanied by Gaia's CERCI since he was eight years old, and after leaving the cooperative, he worked at Panificadora Coelho in Vilar do Para√≠so, Gaia, for fifteen years. After leaving that job for disability, he began to dedicate himself to his passion for football. His fame in the world of football began in the early 1990s when he started to appear behind television reporters, or on stadium stands covered by TV cameras, whenever there was a big football match or another major media event. He also popularized himself for the saying \\"My father is Pinto da Costa and my mother is V√≠tor Ba√≠a\\". A supporter of FC Porto, he is a member of at least four other clubs (Boavista, Le√ßa, Acad√©mica, and Rio Ave) as a result of the friendships he has made. Therefore, Santos has found a way of subsistence, since the fame he gained allows him to ask for some money in exchange of photos or videos taken with other football fans. Some supporters' groups began to adopt him as a mascot, and they are responsible for transporting him to sporting events, thus making amusing stories multiply. Moreover, his popularity guarantees him many appearances in stadiums and other events, where he shows his attraction for cameras. Santos' prominence got him invited to television shows such as Herman SIC, after which Herman Jos√© offered him a denture, graciously shown by Santos. He also appeared on an episode of MTV's show Ridiculousness, which showed the unusual moment when SIC reporter Miguel Guerreiro handed him the microphone and reversed roles, placing himself in the position of \\"Emplastro\\".

It was reproduced in the French literary journal Cahiers d'art, Paris, in 1927, no. 4-5 (p. 172) titled Le compotier.Christian Zervos, Juan Gris, Cahiers d'art, Paris, 1927, no. 4-5 (p. 172) Subsequently, the work was published in Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler's, Juan Gris, His Life and Work, London, 1947 (illustrated pl. 21), and is reproduced on page 195D of the Douglas Cooper, Juan Gris, Catalogue raisonn√© de l‚Äôoeuvre peint, vol. I, Paris, 1977, no. 127, p. 194. The works was first exhibited at the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Internationale Kunst Ausstellung, June ‚Äì September 1926, no. 374. Kahnweiler wrote of work from this period: \\"Apparently Gris' ideal of architectural grandeur can only be realised with a static subject. But during the summer of 1915 he produced a series of pictures which are full of movement.\\"D.H. Kahnweiler, Juan Gris: His Life and Work, trans. D. Cooper, London, 1969, p. 126 Still Life with Checked Tablecloth was painted in Paris by Gris during the month of March, shortly after spending several months in the South of France following the onset of World War I. In a letter to Kahnweiler dated on 26 March 1915, Gris wrote of his evolution as a painter: \\"I think I have really made progress recently and that my pictures begin to have a unity which they have lacked till now. They are no longer those inventories of objects which used to depress me so much.\\"Christopher Green, with Christian Derouet, and Karin von Maur. Juan Gris. Exh. cat., Whitechapel Gallery. London, 1992, pp. 51, 73, 202, pl. 46 Author and critic James Thrall Soby wrote of Nature morte √† la nappe √† carreaux in the catalogue for a 1958 exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, in which the painting was reproduced but not included in the exhibition: > ...for sheer variety his work of 1915 is outstanding. The strange, lovely > fluorescence of The Checked Tablecloth is a long cry from the splintered > complexity of the Still Life. And in connection with the compositional > arrangement of the former picture, mention should be made of Gris' passion > for triangles. Lipchitz has told the writer that Gris revered the triangle > because it is \\"so accurate and endless a form.\\" He added that once when he > and Gris found a triangular-shaped drinking glass, the latter explained: > \\"You see we are influencing life at last.\\"J.T. Soby, Juan Gris, exh. cat., > New York, 1958, pp. 50-57 Art market In 2014 Still Life with Checked Tablecloth was sold at Christie's London for ¬£34.8 million ($57.1 million), attaining a world record price for a work by Juan Gris at a public auction. This surpassed previous records of $20.8 million for his 1915 work, Livre, pipe et verres, and $28.6 million for the 1913 painting, Violon et guitare. Still Life with Checked Tablecloth was purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art with funds donated by Leonard Lauder.

It operates under the brands Kent and Blue Seal and is a subsidiary of the Kent Corporation. History Kent Nutrition Group was founded in 2010 in a corporate consolidation of two separate regional nutrition companies ‚Äî Kent (established in 1927) and Blue Seal (established in 1868) ‚Äî under the Kent Corporation. The original president, Rich Dwyer, led the feed division for its first year of operations and in 2011, John Thorpe become the president of Kent Nutrition Group. In 2016, the company acquired Deluxe Feeds, another Iowa- based feed company. The assets in the deal included Deluxe Feeds' retail stores, feed mills, and its Midwest EnRG Flakes operations. In June 2017, the company announced a $37-million expansion of the Deluxe Feeds plant in Sheldon, Iowa. It broke ground on the expansion in September 2017. The following month, the Kent Nutrition Group opened a new swine research facility at their 800-acre Product Development Center in Muscatine County. In 2019, Mike Gauss was appointed as President, replacing John Thorpe who became President and COO of Kent‚Äôs parent company, Kent Corporation. Brands =Kent= Kent Feeds was founded by Gage A. Kent in Indianola, Iowa in 1927, where he used a mill to manufacture cattle feed. The company's first product, \\"Kent Baby Beef,\\" was marketed as a cattle feed with high protein and no filler. A fire destroyed the original mill in Indianola and eventually Kent moved the company to a new plant in Muscatine, Iowa. In 1952, the company built a new plant in Muscatine. Between 1946 and 1964, Kent grew by 700%. In 1988, Varied Investments (which would later become Muscatine Foods and, eventually, Kent Corporation) acquired H.K. Webster Company of Lawrence, Massachusetts, renaming it Blue Seal Feeds. At that time, both Kent Feeds and Blue Seal Feeds were operating as subsidiaries of Varied Investments. In 2001, Kent Feeds president Jack May resigned and was replaced by Gage A. Kent, the grandson of the company's founder. Kent sells commercial animal and show feeds primarily in the Midwest and nearby regions. =Blue Seal= Blue Seal Feeds was founded as the H.K. Webster Company in 1868 in Lawrence, Massachusetts by Henry K. Webster. Webster had rented a small gristmill to produce animal feed and grain products. His son Dean K. Webster began selling products under the \\"Blue Seal\\" brand name. In 1941, H.K. Webster Company expanded by acquiring a Quaker Oats plant in Richford, Vermont. By 1954, the company was earning $15 million in annual revenue and Ralph Kingman Webster, H.K. Webster's great- grandson, joined the company. By 1988, the firm had grown to 8 plants and 17 retail stores in New England producing $150 million in annual revenue. That year, Varied Investments (which would later become Muscatine Foods and, eventually, the Kent Corporation) acquired the H.K. Webster Company and officially renamed it \\"Blue Seal Feeds.\\" Blue Seal moved its headquarters to a new facility in Londonderry, New Hampshire in 1994. In 2008, the company acquired the I.L. Richer Company, another feed company based in New York. Blue Seal produces a number of branded items, including pet foods and animal feed as well as a line of lawn and garden products. Blue Seal products are primarily sold in the Northeast and along the Eastern Seaboard. Blue Seal also operates several retail stores in New England.

It links the streets Roberto Simonsen and Bitterncourt Rodrigues. In Brazil's colonial times, it had the function of allowing the transit of people and animals between the \\"Largo da S√©\\" and the meadow of Tamanduate√≠ River. Today, under the administration of \\"Casa da Imagem\\" (also known as \\"Casa N√∫mero Um\\"), it houses projects especially developed for the space by contemporary artists. It also constitutes an important architectural, historical and cultural setting, together with buildings that surround it, and integrates the Museu da Cidade de S√£o Paulo.  History  Internal detail from Beco do Pinto The alley was named after Brigadeiro Jos√© Joaquim Pinto de Moraes Leme. In 1821, the military man, then owner of the townhouse ‚Äì a house that later came to be known as Solar da Marquesa de Santos ‚Äì made the first significant change regarding the passage and began a complicated relationship with the C√¢mara Municipal. In addition to being a way of strategical communication that linked the higher part of the city with the lower part, where there was concentration of the trades of S√£o Paulo, the Alley also was a path where the slaves went to fetch water and discard domestic waste. And, for being a steep and winding passage, many chose not to go down to the meadow and dumped the trash wherever they went. Troubled with it, the Brigadeiro closed the Beco do Pinto with a gate, however, this change did not last long, because the order was contested and forbidden by the City Hall, due to it being a public service. Jos√© Joaquim Pinto was again notified a few years later, this time for having expanded his back yard with the construction of a wall. The change would have affected the insulation from the neighbouring house, today the Casa N√∫mero Um. The wall was demolished in 1826. The passage was reopened by the City Hall, receiving the official name of Beco do Col√©gio. = Marquesa de Santos = Domitila de Castro Canto e Melo, the Marquesa de Santos, bought the Solar in 1834. Together with the purchase, came the requirement that the City Hall allow the reconstruction of the demolished wall and the re-installation from the Beco's gate, alleging that there would be no guarantee of security to their property without the usage of such measures. In 1849, the request was attended by the City Hall.DPH, Relat√≥rio de Bens Protegidos do Departamento de Patrim√¥nio Hist√≥rico de S√£o Paulo. Beco do Pinto. Acessado em 29 de outubro de 2016 = Currently = In 1912, after the opening from the slope of Carmo, actual Avenue Rangel Pestana, the Beco lost its function and was deactivated. View from the Casa da Imagem from inside the Beco Currently, the Beco do Pinto is under the responsibility of the Secretaria Municipal de Cultura, and is administered by Casa da Imagem. It integrates the Museu da Cidade de S√£o Paulo and houses artistic installations produced only for this location.  Architectural features  The Beco do Pinto was constructed originally so that transit was possible between the old street of Carmo ‚Äì today, street Roberto Simonsen ‚Äì and the meadow of Tamanduate√≠ river (near what currently is street Bittencourt Rodrigues), places divided by a large slope. It is configured architecturally on a staircase permeated by bids, which alternate between flat and inclined. The steps are made of granite and the flat throws are covered with Portuguese stones. The lateral boundaries are defined by the lots of neighbouring buildings, the Casa N√∫mero Um (current Casa da Imagem) and the Solar da Marquesa de Santos. The Beco is sited in a ground of 368,40 m¬≤ and has two extremities marked by gates with boss and triangular pediment. The gate from the Roberto Simonsen street presents neoclassic ornaments, aduela and the coat of arms of Brazil, in low relief. In addition, there are two archaeological showcases that exhibit vestiges of the old footwear. Panoramic view from the street Roberto Simonsen.  Cultural and historical significance  The Beco do Pinto marks the linking between two buildings of exceptional historical value for the city of S√£o Paulo: the Solar da Marquesa de Santos and the Casa N√∫mero Um. Beyond that, the passage also represents an important historical mark for having been, during the years from the Brazilian colonial age, the main link between the urban center, concentrated around theP√°tio do Col√©gio, and the Tamanduate√≠ river, located where there was a commercial grouping.

This gene encodes a protein which is a member of the so-called zinc finger domain-containing protein family. There is currently very limited understanding about the ZC4H2 gene and its protein function. Any pathogenic variant of ZC4H2 which is associated with a clinical phenotype is referred to as \\"ZC4H2 Deficiency\\". The limited research published to date indicates that ZC4H2 is expressed at various developmental stages and is subject to X-inactivation in females. There are a few families and singletons (males and females) with pathogenic variants of ZC4H2 described in the medical literature. In the families the variants can be transmitted as an X-linked recessive trait, which means that the disorder is fully expressed predominantly in males, while their carrier female siblings are unaffected or much less severely affected. In contrast to these females, heterozygous de novo variants in ZC4H2 in singleton females can result in a specific phenotype. It is believed that the pathogenic variants of ZC4H2 may result in impairment of the central and peripheral nervous system through the impairment of neurologic development and/or synaptic plasticity. Studies in zebrafish showed that the homologue of human ZC4H2 is associated with the generation of a specific subset of central nervous system interneurons. Besides the cases described in the current literature, an additional 46 diagnosed cases of males and females with ZC4H2 Deficiency are known worldwide, constituting this an ultra-rare orphan disorder. Phenotypes There is no clear prediction of the phenotypic expression but it is known that the disorder can be fully expressed in males, while the clinical presentation in singleton females who have a de novo variant can be very variable. Patients with this condition can have several disabilities and health concerns, including a large array of neuromuscular and neurological manifestations. These can include: * Arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) * Muscular atrophy of pelvis and lower extremities * Trunk hypotonia and decreased trunk stability * Dysphagia * Respiratory distress * Joint dislocations of mainly hips * Elevated muscular tone in lower extremities * Spasticity * Dystonia * Autonomic storms * Camptodactyly * Apraxia of speech * Oculomotor apraxia * Cortical visual impairment * Epilepsy * Global developmental delay To date, there is no cure or effective treatment for this condition.

Part of the Magellan Seamounts, it is a shield volcano that has erupted alkali basalt and hawaiite 87 million years ago, but may have continued erupting into the Miocene. During the Cretaceous, reefs developed on the guyot.  Geography and geomorphology  The guyot belongs to the Magellan Seamounts which stretch from the Mariana Trench to Ita Mai Tai seamount. It is also known as Fedorov and Ioan/IOAN, which stands for \\"Institute of Oceanology of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR\\". Ita Mai Tai guyot lies south-southeast of Ioah and Pallada guyot north-northwest, other seamounts in the area east of Ioah are Changpogo, Gramberg, Zatonskii and Arirang. There are about 1000 seamounts in the central western Pacific. Ioah Guyot is a shield volcano with an arcuate shape; the two halves that make it up have dimensions of and . The guyot rises from the seafloor to ‚Äì depth, forming a summit plateau with a surface area of that is covered by high hills. The rim of the summit plateau is formed by volcanic rocks on the eastern part of the seamount and by reefal limestones on the western; the reef deposits form a long ring around the summit platform of Ioah Guyot and cover an area of over . The lower slopes are gentle but steepen between depth. Only the lower slopes are covered with thick sediment layers; the upper slopes have sediment accumulations only in sheltered areas and also feature step-like structures. A number of volcanic cones grew on Ioah and form morphostructures, with a density of about 11.1 vents per . Some of these vents form alignments and Ioah lies at the intersection of two strike-slip faults. The seamount rises from the East Mariana Basin over Jurassic seafloor, between the two Ogasawara Fracture Zones. = Composition = Volcanic rocks found on Ioah Guyot include alkali basalt, tholeiite and hawaiite, plus ankaramite, phonolite and trachybasalt; as well as zeolites formed by hydrothermal processes. Breccia and sandstones cover the exposed rocks and formed through the breakup of basaltic rocks. Reef limestones and other carbonates were emplaced on the seamount, followed during the Eocene-Pleistocene by pelagic sediments. Clay deposits on the slopes and turbidites have also been reported. Ferromanganese crusts on the seamount contain apatite, asbolane, buserite, calcite, clay, feldspar, ferrihydrite, feroxyhyte, goethite, hematite, quartz and todorokite and reach thicknesses of , although they only cover small sectors of Ioah Guyot. Phosphate-containing minerals were deposited over time on Ioah; presently the guyot contains about of phosphorite ore. Some of these ferromanganese deposits form nodules encased within limestones.  History  The seamount developed about 87 million years ago on the Pacific Plate and is now extinct; its estimated age is placed in a range between 88.5 and 86.2 million years. It was located in the Southern Hemisphere as it formed. Some secondary volcanic cones may be much younger, of Miocene age. The formation of Ioah and the other Magellan Seamounts has been explained by a hotspot that would now be located close to the Rarotonga hotspot, Samoa hotspot and Society hotspot were it still active. Compositionally, volcanic rocks from Ioah resemble these of the Rarotonga hotspot. During the Aptian-Cenomanian, limestones and volcanic rocks formed sediments on Ioah Guyot which developed a reef system. A secondary reefal phase occurred during Santonian to Maastrichtian times. Ioah developed the largest reefs of the Magellan Seamounts, with coral material accumulating to thicknesses of . Ferromanganese crusts developed later during the Paleogene and Miocene-Pleistocene, and up to sediments accumulated on the summit plateau.  Biology  Species that lived on Ioah Guyot during the Cretaceous include ammonoids, belemnites, bivalves, bryozoans, cephalopods, corals, crinoids, foraminifera, gastropods, rudists, sea pens, sea urchins and sponges. Presently, a rich fauna has been identified on Ioah Guyot, including scleractinian corals without zooxanthelles such as Fungiacyathus pliciseptus and Peponocyathus australiensis which is usually found in much shallower waters.

The company launched \\"The Star Family Collection\\" in October 2017. Some shade names were made from Star's pet Pomeranians. = 2018 = In January 2018, Star revealed the \\"Blood Sugar\\" palette, which included 18 shades highlighting red tones. It was released on January 29(PR), and February 10(GLOBAL) respectively in the company's lovesick collection, becoming a huge success for the company.

In October 2018, the company started selling its products in Belgium and the Netherlands, followed by France in November. In November 2018, Star released an \\"Alien\\" palette, coinciding with the release of a holiday collection, which contained liquid lip sticks and scrubs. It included the same number of shades as the \\"Blood Sugar\\" palette. The aforementioned \\"skin frost palette\\", a highlighting palette titled \\"Supreme Frost Pro\\", was finally released in December 2018. = 2019 = In March 2019, a successor to the \\"Blood Sugar\\" palette, \\"Blue Blood\\", was released. This palette highlighted blue toned shades and featured a casket shape. A collection coinciding with the palette also released. On April 2, 2019, Star announced that one of the company's warehouses had been robbed; around US$2,500,000 was lost.

Unlike Androgyny, the collaborative palette contained 30 shades. Jawbreaker, the company's \\"biggest release to date\\", was released in June 2019, along with a summer collection. A smaller palette titled \\"Mini Breaker\\" was also released. In October 2019, Shane Dawson's documentary series The Beautiful World of Jeffree Star showcased behind the scenes of Jeffree Star Cosmetics.

Despite an extensive international investigation, the woman's identity, and that of her killer, have never been established. Discovery of the body The body was discovered on 25 January 2010 at the site of a former car park located between Angel Street, Dantzic Street and Miller Street in Manchester, England. The area is known as Angel Meadow and was the location of a notorious Victorian slum which Friedrich Engels notably referred to as \\"hell upon earth\\". At the time of the discovery, the site was being prepared for redevelopment into the new head offices for the Co- operative Group. A workman noticed a skull, which led to the discovery of a human skeleton concealed underneath sections of blue carpet. The police were called to the scene at 15:50.  Description of the victim  The victim had suffered a fractured neck, clavicle and jaw. The police initially believed that the woman was aged 18‚Äì35 when she died. The date of her death was identified as the 1970s or 80s. Police believe the woman was born between 1950 and 1954. In life the victim was a size 12 and her height was between 5 ft 1in and 5 ft 7in. She was probably European but possibly from India or the Middle East. The victim had a number of fillings and her first upper right premolar was missing, which would have been apparent in life when she smiled. The victim was wearing a blue jumper, blue brassiere, a green pinafore dress and black stiletto court shoes (of which only one was found). The pinafore dress was distinctive in that it had large buttons and a unique 1970s-style pattern. A number of items were found with or near the body: a plastic Guinness measuring chart from the late 1960s, an orange patterned carpet, dark blue and blue carpets, tights and a handbag. One of the carpet pieces which covered the body was thought by police to have been removed from a Ford Cortina and featured a hole cut for a gear stick. Initial investigation The death was initially treated as non-suspicious until the postmortem revealed that the woman had suffered a violent death. The investigation commenced with a search of missing person records and an appeal to the public in a hope that someone would recognise the items recovered with the body. Subsequent investigations In May 2011, police revealed a facial reconstruction of the woman. On 24 May 2011 the reconstruction featured on an episode of the BBC Crimewatch programme. At this time, police confirmed that the victims dentistry did not match the dental records of three women known to have gone missing from the Greater Manchester area: Helen Sage (missing 1997), Zoe Simpson (missing 1996) and Helen McCourt (murdered 1988). DNA analysis done in 2011 to try to establish whether the woman was a victim of either Peter Tobin or Ronald Castree who were killers known to be active at the time showed that there was no connection. In November 2012, the police announced they had compiled a list that comprised 18 potential identities for the victim which increased to 21‚Äì22 following input from the public. The police stated that the strongest candidate for the potential identity of the victim was an individual from Tanzania who had been brought to their attention after a Tanzanian family had made contact. Additional leads were investigated from Ireland, Texas and the Netherlands. In March 2015, the remains of the victim were buried in an unmarked grave in Southern Cemetery, Manchester, in a ceremony attended only by the two police detectives who were working on the case. In March 2015, police confirmed that they had a DNA profile of the victim and there were undertaking a familial DNA search as part of the investigation. In 2018, it was suggested by investigative journalist Tim Hicks that the Angel of the Meadow case could be connected to convicted killer Christopher Halliwell.

Biography  =Provenance and early years= Margaret Pretzel was born in Cambridge, England. Her Berlin-born father, Raimund Pretzel had qualified as a lawyer, but abandoned the legal profession after 1933, and at the time of his daughter's birth was attempting - ultimately with considerable success - to reinvent himself as a journalist and author. He had fled from Germany with his pregnant fianc√©e, whom the authorities had identified as Jewish, in 1938. The couple had only received permission to remain in Britain for twelve months, but they nevertheless married in the late summer of 1938, basing themselves in Cambridge where Kurt Hirsch, his wife's brother, had recently received his doctorate in mathematics from the university. The outbreak of war in September 1939 seems to have removed the threat that the British would send the little family back to Nazi Germany, but instead Raimund Pretzel was identified as an enemy alien and in February 1940 locked away in a prison camp in Devon. It was while he was in this camp that he (and the other prisoners) learned of his daughter's birth through a tannoy announcement: \\"A little black head girl from Mister Pretzel\\". Shortly afterwards he was moved to the Isle of Wight. Her mother already had one son, Peter, the elder of Sarah Haffner's two brothers, born as a result of her earlier marriage, to Harald Schmidt-Landry. Erika Schmidt-Landry (1899-1969), had been working as a journalist with a women's magazine till 1938. =New names= During the early part of his time as a political refugee in England, before the authorities arrested him, Raimund Pretzel completed his book, Germany. Jekyll & Hyde.\\"Germany. Jekyll & Hyde\\", London 1940 (German edition: \\"Germany. Jekyll & Hyde\\". Deutschland von Innen betrachtet, Berlin 1996) It was his first \\"serious\\" book on history and politics: till now his publications had concerned fashion, music and entertainment. He used a pseudonym in order to try and protect relatives who remained in Germany against unwelcome questions from the Gestapo. He chose the name \\"Sebastian Haffner\\", explaining it as a celebration of two of Germany's great positive contributions to the world. \\"Sebastian\\" was the middle name of Johann Sebastian Bach and \\"Haffner\\" recalled Mozart's 35th Symphony. He very soon adopted the pseudonym as his regular name: his daughter's family name therefore changed from \\"Pretzel\\" to \\"Haffner\\". She would adopt the name \\"Sarah\\" only when she was a teenager, however. \\"Sara\\" was the name the Nazis had scornfully imposed on every Jewish woman, regardless of her real name. Adopting \\"Sarah\\" as her own \\"Christian\\" name after the Nazi nightmare had ended, seemingly for good, was, for Sarah Haffner an important part of discovering and asserting her own identity. =England= In May 1940 her mother was also interned by the British, both parents now identified as enemy aliens. Her parents were deported to the Isle of Man where they were held in separate camps, unable to contact each other. Their daughter was permitted to stay with her mother, however. Shortly before her mother's release, in October 1940, the child won a baby competition, officially designated as the most beautiful baby in the internment camp. The British authorities were beginning to see the irony of locking up large number of German political refugees whose only obvious crime had been to escape from Nazi Germany in order to avoid being killed. Raimund Pretzel had been among the first to be released. His recently published book Germany. Jekyll & Hyde had resonated with a number of members of the British establishment who had been unable to understand why the author had been locked away. Someone else impressed by the book had been David Astor of The Observer (newspaper). Sebastian Haffner accepted an offer to write regularly for the paper, initially on a freelance basis. The family relocated to London in 1942, their financial position no longer so precarious as when they had arrived in England in 1938. Most of her childhood was spent growing up with her family in London. Sarah Haffner was very close to her father. When she was nine he took her to her first concert. The Amadeus Quartet were playing: four fellow refugees from Nazi race-hate, and one of the twentieth century's greatest string quartets. They played Schubert's String Quartet No. 13. The audience cheered and gave the players a standing ovation. Sarah Haffner felt hugely privileged to be present for that occasion, with her father behind her. Her eldest (half) brother, Peter, was identified as an artistic talent from a relatively early age, and it was he who drew their parents' attention to Sarah's growing artistic talent. In 1953 he recommended that they should use her oil paintings as serious Christmas presents. = Berlin = She moved to West Berlin with her parents in 1954. Both Sarah and her father would for the rest of their lives operate an Anglo-German existence, balancing the two cultures in their domestic and professional lives. Sarah's intention to make her way in life as a painter ran into parental opposition. Her father insisted that she would never be able to support herself as an artist. She should complete her school career in Germany and she might then train for work as a graphic artist, a branch in which she might find reliable employment in commerce or advertising. Or she might become a specialist restorer of \\"old masters\\". The arguments lasted for months. When she was sixteen she diverted into vocational training for a lifetime career as a serious artist. Haffner attended the \\"Meisterschule f√ºr das Kunsthandwerk\\" handcraft academy in West Berlin for a year. Aged seventeen, on the recommendation of teachers at the handicraft academy, she moved on to the Berlin University of the Arts (\\"Hochschule der K√ºnste\\" / HdK). After mastering the basics she was accepted into the specialist painting class taught by Ernst Schumacher. = Family matters = When she was nineteen she became pregnant. (\\"Stupidly, I became pregnant when I was 19 (laughs) / Dummerweise bin ich mit 19 schwanger geworden (lacht)\\". She was married to the artist Andreas Brandt between 1960 and 1962. David Brandt would grow up to become a successful photographer, based in Dresden, but his birth in 1960 caused his mother to break off her studies at the HdK, from which she would graduate only in 1973. She was, in the meantime, able to support herself as a freelance artist. = Teaching in Watford and Berlin = Alongside her work as an artists and author, Sarah Haffner was involved as a teacher at various academies between 1969 and 1986. In 1969 she returned to England intending, as she later explained, to enhance her earnings and to get away from the increasingly fevered atmosphere among students and academics as the Paris events of May 1968 resonated with student radicals in the German cities. Her brother, Peter, had been teaching at the Watford School of Art since 1960. In England it was possible to become an art teacher without the inflexibly regulated file of qualifications and certificates that would have been needed in Germany. She obtained a three term contract at the same institution as her half-brother, which provided a livelihood in the London area for the next fifteen months. However, she found herself ill-suited to the \\"small-talk dinner party culture\\" which seemed to be part of the artistic milieu of the time and place. She also noted that whereas in Germany the tradition had endured since the nineteenth century whereby \\"every architect, dentist or psychologist\\" would invest in one or two pieces of original art - or at least a print - for the waiting room, no equivalent custom existed in England. There would be no easy path to riches as a free-lance artist in England. After fifteen months she returned to Berlin with her son. Her teaching experience in England now helped her obtain a job at the \\"1. Staatlichen Fachschule f√ºr Erzieher\\" (teacher training academy} where for ten years, till 1981, she taught \\"Children's Play and Work\\" (\\"Kinderspiel und Arbeit\\"). Between 1980 and 1986 she taught at the Berlin University of the Arts (\\"Hochschule der K√ºnste\\" / HdK). = Freelance artist in Berlin = Despite her father's earlier misgivings, Sarah Haffner built a successful career as a freelance artist in Berlin. She took to specialising in large oil paintings, but there were also smaller more spontaneous works. As art became her principal source of income she reached the point of selling between eight and ten abstract landscape paintings each year. Initially she obtained a price of around 1,500 Marks per painting, but over the years she became better known and the price per painting rose to an average of around 4,000 Marks. Selling one or two of her larger paintings in a year meant she could, as she told an interviewer ruefully, \\"live well\\". She avoided working with galleries who might take commissions as high as 40% or 50%, but managed to have her work featured in perhaps four or five exhibitions each year. Positive reviews and recognition followed little by little. In commercial terms there were nevertheless also bad years. Unlike many left-wing artists with whom, as an instinctively anti-authoritarian woman, she mixed, Sarah Haffner welcomed the fall of the wall and reunification. Nevertheless, the reunification, formalised in October 1990, introduced an additional two thousand professional painters to the Berlin art market. There was, at that stage, no corresponding increase in potential buyers for contemporary art. The market was further depressed by uncertainty about the future, as westerners faced supplementary taxation to finance the economic regeneration of the \\"neuen Bundesl√§nder\\" (former East Germany). In 1992 income from her art plunged to a net figure of 7,000 Marks. For Haffner, however, there was a spectacular rebound in 1993. Following a Berlin exhibition that included her work, the Berliner Zeitung published a particularly positive review. A Swiss collector read the review while on a flight, and purchased nine pictures. A succession of further sales followed. In 1993 Sarah Haffner's earned a net income of 170,000 from her art \\"with which I could live for several years\\". = Feminist activism = In 1975 Sarah Haffner worked on a television documentary on violence against women, highlighting the existence in England of shelters for women escaping domestic violence. She had been prompted to produce the documentary by her own futile attempts, involving the police and other public officials, to help a neighbour in Berlin who had become a victim of domestic violence. She followed up the documentary with a book, \\"Gewalt in der Ehe und was Frauen dagegen tun\\", on the same theme. The documentary led to the funding of a shelter for women in Berlin. It was the first shelter of its kind anywhere in West Berlin or West Germany. Haffner herself worked for six months at the shelter on an unpaid basis. = Death = Until well into the second decade of the twenty-first century Sarah Haffner lived and worked in the Charlottenburg quarter of Berlin, close (on its western side) to the infamous wall. She became aware that she was incurably ill several months before she died, and continued, as before, to insist that she had no wish whatever to be \\"kept alive at any price\\". She moved away from Berlin and spent her final months living close to her son, David Brandt, a professional photographer based in Dresden. She was 78 when she died there.  Work  = The painter = Sarah Haffner's artistic spectrum includes portraits, still lifes, landscapes and cityscapes. After 1985 her figurative style evolved from an additive object-oriented focus towards an increasingly abstract presentational approach. Her tectonically structured and strongly formed shapes, and the reduced imagery leave the forms shown as coloured surfaces. In apparent contrast to the rigidity of the forms is the intensity of the colours she uses. Her colour selection is expressive and spatial rather than naturalistic. She is in particular drawn to shades of blue and green. Frequently the colour selection intensifies a mood of isolation and melancholy that emanates from the tranquil scenes and views. Haffner used her figurative painting style to evoke mood and atmosphere. Images which at first glance appear intensely personal often turn out to reflect far more general experience, which Sarah Haffner uses to disclose social realities, but without venturing into overt agitation. After 2004 she took to working with a \\"Tempera and Pastell\\" mixing technique that she had developed for herself.  Reflections of a female artist  Through her writings and in interviews Sarah Haffner developed a reputation as a committed feminist. Several of the themes to which she would return are encapsulated in a lengthy interview she gave to the academic, Prof. Dr. C√§cilia Rentmeister in 1977. The interview also provides insights into Haffner's own life and career. :\\"When I was seventeen I enrolled at the Arts Academy (HdK) where I felt appallingly uncomfortable, and although I could not have put it in to words back then, I was subconsciously aware that I was viewed in the first instance not as an artist but as a woman, and that it was as a woman that I generated interest. That created a pressure that meant that when I went to class in trousers, I knew that I would paint. But if I went in wearing a dress I knew I would hang around in the faculty waiting for people to talk to me ... I knew precisely that within me there were two separate mindsets - a form of inner schism, if you will - I was extremely ambitious, but for me it was also quite clear that you can only achieve if you constantly work at it. But it was not just me: all the girls at the academy knew that somehow they were not valued at their full worth. I certainly suffered from that: I valued myself fully, demanded much of myself, and somehow I was disappointed that my own self-assessment diverged so far from the reactions of others.\\" Sarah Haffner was no stranger to the tensions between motherhood and career ambitions. Her own situation was further complicated by marriage. :\\"My husband only painted stripes ... Nevertheless, as a painter he was always the more important of us ... I have always seen relationships as disrupters of independence, and could under those circumstances paint only very badly ... I was in an \\"artists' marriage\\", it was awful. Because in the end the relationship between us became somehow competitive ... and when my son was born, my husband had just been given his own studio at the academy, and I said, 'now It's my turn to paint again, and he must care for the child'. But for him it was perfectly clear that I would now simply be a homemaker ... Bringing motherhood and painting together, that was an eternal ... hiccup.\\" Sarah Haffner would interrogate gender stereo- types, whether they were applied by women or by men. She was indignant when the selectors of the female artists to be featured in the \\"K√ºnstlerinnen International 1877 - 1977\\" exhibition, held in Berlin in 1977, decided not to allow the artists Maina-Miriam Munsky and Natascha Ungeheuer to participate. Haffner withdrew her own work from the exhibition in protest and published a statement: :\\"For hundreds of years paintings produced by women have been kept as secrets, hushed up, or attributed to men ... Now, for the first time, there is to be a major exhibition of women's art in West Berlin. Women's paintings, you would think, are the paintings produced by women. Maina-Miriam Munsky and Natascha Ungeheuer were not invited to take part in the exhibition. Their paintings are alleged to be sexist or unwomanly. Determination of what is womanly and what is unwomanly is undertaken by a self-declared elite coterie of women who at no point bothered even to introduce themselves to the exhibition participants or openly to set forth their selection criteria, far less to familiarise themselves with feminist priorities which participants represent... The women's movement must be open to all women or it will break down. But it is far to important to be allowed to break down. I will not take part in this exhibition: that is my protest.\\" Sarah Haffner celebrated her eighteenth birthday in February 1968. She lived through the \\"1968 events\\" and the manifestations of Second-wave feminism both as a youthful and very determined art student and as a slightly bemused young mother. In one of a series of radio interviews conducted (and subsequently published in 2002) by Ute K√§tzel, Sarah Haffner recalled her experiences of those events. From early in 1968 Haffner took to participating in meetings of the West Berlin \\"Action Council on Women's Liberation\\". :\\"I remember twelve or fifteen women, telling everything about themselves ... I had always thought there was something not quite right with me, but now I saw that we all had been through the same experiences ... I never felt more alive ... I identified completely with the Action Council ... this process of self-awareness building that we went through, which became a realisation among the women concerning their own oppression. I even think that women were the revolutionary part of this somewhat wider revolutionary movement, precisely because they questioned their own situations.\\" References People from Cambridge Artists from Berlin Realist painters 20th-century German painters 21st-century German painters Berlin University of the Arts faculty Writers from Berlin German non-fiction writers German women's rights activists German women writers German women painters 1940 births 2018 deaths ","title":"Sarah Haffner"},{"id":"58478535","text":"The Lockheed RC-130 Hercules were variants of the C-130 Hercules, designed for photographic or electronic reconnaissance missions.Francillon 1982, p. 347-373 Operational history A replica of 56-0528, a C-130A-II \\"Sun Valley\\" reconnaissance aircraft shot down over Armenia, Soviet Union, in 1958, on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, Fort Meade, Maryland On 2 September 1958, C-130A-II 56-0528 was shot down after it intruded into Soviet airspace during a reconnaissance mission along the Turkish-Armenian border.

The first novel written by a woman in California was Steele's, The Victims of Fate, a work of fiction loosely based on David C. Broderick, the preface stating: \\"Some of the incidents of this little story, (although mingled with fiction,) are real facts. I had the honor of being acquainted with the hero, from my earliest childhood. First as a lad of little promise, although to use a quaint expression, King-Bee among his boy companions. After, as a young, terprising aspirant for political fame. Last, as the finished gentleman and a nation's pride.\\" Steele was well known for the entertainments which she provided during the early days of the California Gold Rush, where, with her son, George, she acted out scenes from Shakespeare and bits of comedy. Early years Rowena Granniss was born in Goshen, New York, June 20, 1824. Her parents were Harry and Julie Granniss. Her siblings were: Rodney Grannis (1813-1813), Mary Emily Grannis (1814-1878), John V Granniss (1815-1898), Mary Grannis (1816-1870), Harriet E Grannis (1819-1901), Joel M Grannis (1820-1856), Horace Rosive Grannis (1821-1889), John Chandler Grannis (1824-1881), Reliance Roxanna Grannis (1827-1829), Frances A. Granniss (1827-1902), Henry Martyn Grannis (1830-1874), Charles Norbert Grannis (1848-1868), and Luella Grannis (1850-1918). At an early age, she showed talent for composition, but, being of an extremely sensitive nature, her efforts were burned as soon as written. Career =Performer and theater manager= In 1846, she married Thomas Neptune Claughley (1818‚Äì1860). While he abandoned the family in 1853 to pursue the California Gold Rush, she performed in Barnum's American Museum in New York City. In 1856, she and the couple's two sons, Henry and George, removed to California in search of Thomas. After finding him and discovering him to be a \\"bum\\", she gave up his surname. In April of that year, she was a performer of Shakesperian readings, songs, dances, and Yankee stories at San Francisco's Metropolitan Theater using the stage name \\"Miss Rowena Granice\\". In September, with Dan Virgil Gates, she was performing a similar program in Petaluma, California. The following month, the Trinity Times gave her performance in Trinity County, California a poor review: \\"A certain Rowena Granice sang hideously. She has no voice, or rather the voice of a diseased crow. Rowena cannot dance, unless bears dance.\\" In 1857, Granice became the Lessee and Manager of the Sacramento Theater. In the year and the following, she performed in various Northern California venues including the National Theater of Sacramento in Oroville, the Southern Mines (gold mines below the Mokelumne River), and Folsom, as well as in the Sandwich Islands. Though she and Mr. Claughley were not divorced, she married John P. (\\"Yankee\\") Addams (d. 1885) on 5 March 1858, in Sacramento. Though he was a one-time leader of a large Mormon colony, when she met him, Addams was an actor, manager, dramatist, comedian, and ultimately \\"a hopeless rover\\". Granice and Addams formed a traveling theater company, along with Myers and Gale. In May 1859, Steele opened a saloon, \\"The Gaieties, Temple of Mirth and Song\\" on Commercial Street in San Francisco where she performed burlesque. Lotta Crabtree, Granice's protege and Louise Paullin were members of Granice's company at The Gaieties. In August, Mr. Claughley closed and nailed up the theater. The next morning, Granice re-opened it. Claughley closed it a second time, and Granice opened it a second time. Each complained of the other and they were both arrested. The business closed for a while that year, during which time she performed at a Sacramento, California theater. In November of that year, while she was the proprieter of the Union Theater in San Francisco, she was arraigned in the San Francisco Police Court for assault and battery on a theater goer, but when the complaint was called, Grance was discharged on the consent of the complainant. The Gaieties had reopened by January 1860, when there was news of an altercation which involved Mr. Claughley and others. In 1866, she was traveling in San Joaquin County, giving readings and comic songs; and in July 1868, she was in Tuolumne City with her son, George, performing scenes from Macbeth and Othello as well as skits she had penned, including Judy Murflinnigan's trip from Ould Ireland and The Maniac. In 1871, while residing in Snelling, she was the head of a local amateur dramatic association. =Author and publisher= Through the force of circumstances, she was compelled to offer her stories and sketches to the newspapers and magazines, and in less than two years, the name of Rowena Granice had become a household word in every town in the new State of California. The newspapers praised the simple home stories of the new California writer. The taste for sensational stories among the early miners, in harmony with their own feverish life, was indicated by the favor accorded to the contributions of Steele, then writing as Rowena Granice, to The Golden Era, so much so as to prompt the reissue of several stories. The first novel written by a woman in California, so far as known, was Steele's, The Victims of Fate. Appearing in 1857, it was published by Sterrett & Co. One thousand copies were sold in San Francisco and five thousand throughout the State. She published The Family Gem in 1858, a collection of her short stories. On June 13, 1861, at Salmon Falls, California, she married Robert Johnson Steele. In April 1862, while living in Auburn, California, she published a novelette, The Suicide's Curse. In July, Granice and her new husband started the Pioneer newspaper in Snelling, California. They soon removed to Merced, California where the paper was enlarged. The San Joaquin Valley Argus was published every Saturday morning in Merced. The San Joaquin Valley Argus described itself as \\"the only Independent, Reform paper in Merced county, advocating Temperance and general Reform, socially, morally and politically. This paper was the first newspaper ever published in Merced county, being started at Snelling, the county seat, July 3d, 1862, with Mr. R. J. Steele as proprietor and editor, and Mrs. R. G. Steele as assistant editor. It is bold and fearless in advocating right and truth. It is permanently established, has a large circulation in three counties, is well known, and consequently one of the best advertising mediums in the San Joaquin Valley.\\" This also included the Republican Weekly of which Mr. and Mrs. Steele were its editors, while Mrs. Steele was the publisher and proprietor. In 1874, she authored Dell Dart, or, Within the meshes. She continued to act as associate editor of the couple's newspaper until 1877, when the failing health of her husband compelled her to take entire charge, and for seven years, she was editor and proprietor. In 1884, assisted by her son, she started a daily, in connection with the weekly. In 1889, her husband died. After conducting successfully the newspaper business in the same county for twenty-eight years, she sold out. In 1892, she was editor and proprietor of the Budget, in Lodi, California. Steele was an active writer and worker for the temperance cause. She was also an advocate of woman suffrage, both as a speaker and writer. Personal life Steele had three sons, Henry Hale Granice (unknown‚Äì1915), George Law Granice (1853‚Äì1877), and Lee Richmond Steele (1862‚Äì1925). Henry and Lee both became journalists. In 1874, She died February 7, 1901 in Merced, after an illness of several weeks from a general breaking down of the system;. She had been failing for several years and rapidly the last few months. She was buried at the Merced Cemetery.

Early life and family Kathleen Cruise O'Brien was born Katherine Mary Joseph Sheehy in Loughmore, County Tipperary on 24 April 1886. She was the youngest child of David Sheehy and Elizabeth \\"Bessie\\" Sheehy (n√©e McCoy). Her older siblings were Hanna, Mary, Margaret, Eugene and Richard. The year O'Brien was born, the family moved to Dublin after her father's election to the British parliament. Firstly the family lived in Drumcondra, and then 2 Belvedere Place. Her father was a leading member of the Irish Parliamentary Party and a close associate of John Dillon. Her uncle, Fr Eugene Sheehy, was known as the \\"land league priest\\". O'Brien attended Dominican convent school, Eccles Street, before going on to a girls' school in Amiens, France from 1906 to 1907 as an exchange student. The French girl she exchanged with, Andr√©e, went on to marry her nephew Owen Sheehy-Skeffington. O'Brien went on to study Irish at University College, St Stephen's Green, going on to further perfect her language skills on the Aran Islands, County Galway. O'Brien's mother held monthly salons at the family home from the late 1890s onwards. Many of the guest included friends of her brothers. James Joyce was a frequent visitor, and his biographer Richard Ellmann has speculated that Miss Ivors from The dead was modelled on O'Brien. This claim has been disputed. Career Along with her sister Hanna and Mary, O'Brien was a founding member of Irish Women's Franchise League in November 1908. She was an active member of the Young Ireland Branch (YIB) of the United Irish League (UIL) which was the only branch which admitted women. She served on the executive and was elected vice president in 1910. On 1 October 1911 she married the journalist Francis Cruise O‚ÄôBrien, who was a friend of her brothers from college. Her family strongly opposed the marriage, objecting to his politics, lack of career prospects and religious agnosticism. Only Hanna and her husband, Francis Sheehy Skeffington, supported the marriage. The couple lived at 44 Leinster Rd, Rathmines, and had one son, Conor Cruise O‚ÄôBrien. O'Brien taught Irish at the Rathmines technical college part-time after her marriage. Under the name Caitl√≠n N√≠c Sh√≠othaigh, O'Brien wrote Irish textbooks, and developed an Irish language edition of Gregg shorthand in the 1920s. O'Brien wrote a number of plays, included Apartments, a one-act farce which was performed at the Abbey Theatre in September 1923 which she wrote under the name Fand O‚ÄôGrady. O'Brien's extended family were divided over supporting Britain in World War I, and convinced her husband not to make speeches in favour of recruiting into the army, especially as he was medically unfit to serve himself. O'Brien was the only one of her sisters not to be widowed in 1916, when all three of her brothers-in-law died: Bernard Culhane, Francis Sheehy Skeffington, and Thomas Kettle. O'Brien's husband died in December 1927, which led to her struggle financially and fall into debt with moneylenders. She worked full-time at the Rathmines School as well as superintending Irish annual state examinations in convent schools in the west of Ireland. Despite being a practising Catholic, and receiving a lot of pressure from clergy, O'Brien kept her son at the liberal Protestant school, Sandford Park School, her husband had selected for him. O'Brien died at home, following a stroke, on 12 February 1938.

Criminal activity =Early activities and imprisonment= His first documented run-in with the law was in Baku, Azerbaijan during 1995 on false charges according to Salifov. By law, Azerbaijani authorities can hold a suspect for up to 72 hours. Salifov was detained for eight months. He claims he was held under barbaric conditions: a starvation diet barely adequate for subsistence; no fresh water; no facilities for washing, shaving or cutting his hair or nails; and no medical care. This apparently resulted in his weight dropping from to a mere . On 19 July 1996, at age 22, he was convicted of the murder of two rival gang members, despite his protestations of innocence. At the time of his arrest, he was in possession of a Stechkin APS machine pistol, a weapon that at that time only the head of the Azerbaijani Ministry of Internal Affairs, the MVD, was thought to possess. Salifov was given the death penalty but the presiding judge commuted the sentence to 15 years' imprisonment. Ten of those 15 years were spent in solitary confinement.Press release by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and General Public Prosecutors Office of the Republic of Azerbaijan Two months after he was imprisoned, authorities arrested his father and placed him in the same prison. While there his father came under repeated pressure to denounce and accuse him, but these attempts met with no success. According to Salifov's lawyer, at the time of his arrest he was carrying a passport of the former USSR issued in Georgia. Salifov appears not to have applied for citizenship during these years spent in prison. While in prison Salifov had an additional 16 years added to his original 15-year sentence, as a result of assault charges filed by a female visitor. She, however, later withdrew her story and claimed to have made the original allegations under duress. At the same time, Salifov was informed that his 10 years in solitary would not count towards his release date. He used contacts and ingenuity to maintain various profitable criminal enterprises during his incarceration. He also possessed a cell phone, having four different numbers with which he kept contact with criminal associates who had been released and were at large. By these means he conducted an extortion racket against various Azerbaijani businesses and individuals. Salifov is also believed, with the assistance of his brother and through bribing prison authorities, to have arranged for at least eight women to be taken in to the prison for sexual purposes. In some cases this was allegedly against the women's will and resulted in rape. He is also believed to have made similar arrangements for certain fellow prisoners. Some of the women subsequently made allegations of rape and coercion, but these never reached court. In 2010, while Salifov was still in prison, there was a turf war known as The Dill War between associates of Nadir Salifov and those of Rovshan Janiyev (known as Rovshan Lenkoransky) over acquiring the green grocers markets in Moscow and on its Ring Road, which had previously been operated by convicted criminal Bakic Aliyev. Four men with criminal histories were killed during this conflict.Azerbaijani ‚ÄòThieves of Law‚Äô in Moscow Fight for Control of Onions, Dill Market In 2014 there was more struggling for the lucrative markets which led to a \\"Wild Western-style\\" gunfight during a meeting of the competing clans in the Absheron cafe in Moscow in which one man was killed with several suffering gunshot wounds.Battle in Absheron: Caucasian gangsters fighting in Moscow Salifov denied all these claims as baseless attempts to sully his good name and reputation. =After prison release activities= Upon his release from prison in 2017, Salifov wasted no time in establishing his dominance in the existing underworld. Even while in prison, he had a huge influence on a part of the criminal world, both on criminals and on other community members, especially in places where the Azeri diaspora was present. He was marked as a potential replacement for Rovshan Lenkoransky, the convicted criminal murdered the previous year. This tied in with reports from early 2017 that Dzhaniev's underboss Agayar Agayev (aka Sedoy, Russian for \\"grey-haired\\"), who used to control the Yekaterinburg market, was now representing Salifov's interests. This appeared to be the case despite the fact that there was no love lost between Salifov and Rovshan Lenkoransky.Guli at large to redraw underworld In December 2017 Russian police were attempting to defuse a tense situation in which Chechen criminals under Aziz Batukaev had been trying to take control of the green grocer markets held by Salifov's group. Nadir Salifov had laid claims to the Food City market in Moscow controlled by Rovshan Lenkoransky's proxies. According to police, the war for the largest wholesale food market in the capital was just getting going.Operatives prevent redistribution of influence between Guli and Aziz‚Äôs clans in Moscow In March 2018, an Azeri claiming to be an exiled journalist, Rahim Namazov, was ambushed in the suburbs of Toulouse, France. Namazov was seriously wounded in the attack and his wife died of her injuries. Unsubstantiated claims suggest that this attack may have been ordered by Salifov as payback for previous insults and offenses.Azerbaijani mafia in the heart of Europe? Requests for Salifov's arrest were made through Interpol to Georgian, Russian and Ukrainian authorities, but to no avail. Recently, Salifov was detained briefly in the UAE and Montenegro but no extradition took place. It is believed that he may have been residing in Turkey, but could not be confirmed.Former candidate for main crime lord throne guli caught and released in Europe.Azerbaijani mafia boss ‚ÄòLotu Quli‚Äô nabbed in Istanbul'Greetings to all!' - Thief in law Nadir Salifov - 'Guli' =Death= Salifov was shot dead on 19 August 2020 at a restaurant in Antalya, Turkey by one of his own bodyguards.Crime Boss Of Post-Soviet Underworld Shot Dead In Turkey  References   External links  1972 births 2020 deaths 21st-century criminals Russian people of Azerbaijani descent Russian mobsters People from Dmanisi Georgian Azerbaijanis Deaths by firearm in Turkey ","title":"Nadir Salifov"},{"id":"58478886","text":"Advanced Computer Software Group Ltd.

After his undergraduate study, he joined the U.S. Navy and served in the Pacific theater during World War II. He then earned advanced degrees and became a professor and historian. In undertaking the editing and publishing of the papers of George Washington, Abbot examined some 135,000 letters and documents from and to Washington. Abbot's career as a teacher and historian lasted nearly 50 years. Early years Abbot was born in Louisville, Georgia, the son of William Wright Abbot II and Lillian Abbot. He attended Louisville Academy public high school and graduated in 1939. He soon enrolled in Davidson College and attended for two years. In 1941 he transferred to the University of Georgia and graduated in 1943. That year he was awarded the Baccalaureate degree just before joining the United States Navy. Abbot's career as a teacher began when he was assigned to teach celestial navigation to young naval cadets at Duke University in the spring of 1946; he studied under Charles Sydnor.The Georgia Historical Quarterly, 2009, pp. 477‚Äì478 That fall, he returned to his hometown to teach science and English grammar at his old high school. Abbot then went back to Duke University to study history under the GI Bill and earned his master's and doctorate degrees. He completed his PhD studies in 1953 and was hired by the College of William & Mary in Virginia as an assistant professor of history.Hill & Wood, 2009 Career During World War II, Abbot served in small naval ships and saw service in the Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean and Adriatic seas. He later remarked that he had reached the height of his personal authority at age 22, when, while serving in the Pacific theater, he was in charge of SC-504, a submarine chaser. He served from 1943-1946, and rose to the rank of lieutenant junior grade. Abbot was a history professor at the University of Virginia (UVA). In 1960‚Äì1961 he edited the university's publication Journal of Southern History. Abbot was the James Madison Professor of History and taught colonial history at the UVA. He became a longtime editor of Washington's correspondence and papers. The aim of his undertaking was to compile and publish a definitive collection of Washington's works. He worked on Washington's papers for more than 15 years, raising several million dollars in funding while reading or editing more than 135,000 of Washington's documents.Shapiro, 2009 His research into the Colonial period has been acclaimed for greatly expanding on the existing knowledge of the Continental government during its formative period.Shapiro, 2009 Works The Papers of George Washington, Abbot's Washington papers project, has approximately 50 volumes and was expected to be completed in 2017 and expand to more than 80 volumes. The voluminous work is divided into five categories: the Colonial Series; the Revolutionary War Series; the Confederation Series; the Presidential Series; and the Retirement Series.Abbot, 2018 Overview of works It is estimated that there are some 135,000 pieces of correspondence from or addressed to Washington.Twohig, 1983, Journal Essay : Provenance, vol. 1, pp. 1‚Äì13 This project differs from earlier attempts to chronicle and edit Washington's papers due to its greater depth of coverage. Abbot's comprehensive perspective project about the first president covers \\"both sides of the story\\", which also includes thousands of letters addressed to Washington, according to former project editor Dorothy Twohig. She further maintains that Abbot was very meticulous and went to great lengths to consult every possible document which provided detailed information, explaining the context of every letter and diary entry of Washington in his effort to help readers understand \\"why Washington took the measures that he did\\". Edward G. Lengel also was involved in the editing of the Washington papers. Abbot's 1959 work, The Royal Governors of Georgia, is said to be unsurpassed and unchallenged in Georgia history. It is considered the leading authority on Governors Reynolds, Ellis and Wright and the most important work covering Georgia's history. For his effort, Abbot was awarded the John Macpherson Berrien Award by the Georgia Historical Society. Abbot also wrote The Colonial Origins of the United States, 1607‚Äì1763, published in 1975. Death Abbot died of congestive heart failure on August 31, 2009, in a hospital in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 87. He is buried in Louisville City Cemetery in Louisville, Georgia.

At the age of 12 his family moved back to Afghanistan. At that point in his life he saw what decades of war had done to his country. Asir states \\"The buildings were all destroyed and everywhere was destroyed by the Taliban.\\" Asir studied theater at Kabul University. After graduation from university Asir wanted to apply his education to address social problems in Afghanistan and he decided to do this by means of entertainment. Asir was well-familiar with the work of Charlie Chaplin through Iranian TV and Asir was fascinated with both Chaplin and acting in general. Lisa Stein Haven, an English professor at Ohio University in Zanesville and a silent comedy scholar, explains her fascination with Karim Asir. Stein Haven emphasizes that there are \\"no words involved\\" and therefore \\"no language\\" and that Asir \\"didn‚Äôt want to go to dialogue film, because he didn‚Äôt want to put an English language on it\\" and that he could thereby \\"speak to people throughout the world through pantomime\\". Stein Haven points out that Charlie Chaplin \\"had fans in Russia, he had fans all over the world. I think he went to Bali in 1932 and he found that his films had been seen there. And Bali was relatively untouched at that time.\\" Some critics point out that comedy is inappropriate for the multitude of problems Afghanistan faces. They point to lack of water and lack of housing. Asir concedes the existence of these problems but responds \\"we also need to be happy\\". Asir has been threatened by militants and Asir says \\"I am afraid of being targeted by suicide bombings or explosions but these issues cannot stop me carrying out my work and performances.

By the conclusion of Season 1, the podcast had been downloaded 430,000 times and reached No. 1 on iTunes' podcast chart.  History  = Season 1 = The first season focused on the murder of Elizabeth Andes, a 23-year-old Miami University graduate, who was stabbed to death on December 28, 1978. Andes' boyfriend Bob Young had found her body and was immediately questioned in her death. After 15 hours of interrogation, including being given a lie detector test that he was told he failed, Young confessed to the murder. He immediately recanted, saying that Hamilton County Lt. Richard Carpenter, the polygraph administrator, had \\"scared the hell out of me.\\" Young faced a murder trial the following spring but was acquitted by the jury. In 1981, Young was tried again for Andes' death in civil court after Andes' family sued him for wrongful death. He was found not liable by the jury. Accused presented three other acquaintances of Andes' who were not seriously investigated at the time by police in Oxford, Ohio. Season 1, which was originally published under the title Accused: The Unsolved Murder of Elizabeth Andes, premiered on September 7, 2016. It originally ran for eight episodes, concluding on September 28. A ninth episode titled \\"The Update\\" was released on December 26.

View of Vela Luka from Korintia  Geography  It is located on the southeastern part of the island of Krk in the Ba≈°ka municipality and on the sea route from Ba≈°ka to Senj . It is about 1.8 km long and about 400 meters wide. On the south- eastern side it closes the Cape Sokol. At the entrance to the cove the depth is over 60 meters, and from the middle of the bay the depth gradually falls. The bottom is predominantly sandy. At the end of the bay is a large sandy beach . There are several mostly ruinous coves in the cove. It is only a beach facility that works in summer as a catering facility. There is also a concrete mullet near it, but the depth is just 1.5 meters away. There is a somewhat greater depth (2‚Äì3 m) with the L-shaped mill located on the eastern coast of the bay. There is a source of drinking water at the end of the bay. Apart from by boat from the sea, the bay can also be reached on foot from Ba≈°ka. The trail is about 6 km long and rises to a height of 300 meters and then goes down to the sea. The trails are diverse because of the large number of karst phenomena (canyons, cliffs), numerous centuries-old pastry drywall and many panoramic vistas of Ba≈°ka, Prviƒá Island, Senjska vrata and Vela and Mala Luka. Vela Luka bay is open towards the south, and the wind in the south creates great waves. Even though it is shrouded, it is not suitable for shelter from the wind, because burrs created by boulders bounce back from the west coast of the bay and create whirlwinds and great sea disturbances. However, leaving the boat from the bay can be more dangerous as it comes to the area where one of the strongest strikes in the Adriatic is coming. The most common wind is a bura which is very common in summer. Beach from the water  History  In the area between Vele and Male Luke, which is called Bosar, in ancient times there was a Roman settlement. It is thought to have been used to oversee the strategically important Senj Gate on the mainland. The remains of Roman clay and counterfeit Roman coins were found in this area. Also found was golden Byzantine money, which is in favor of the theory that during the time of Byzantine rule on Krk there was also a settlement which in the local legends has the name Corinthia.,Abraham, Rudolph: The Islands of Croatia: 30 walks on 14 Adriatic islandshttp://www.krkcroatia.net/vela-luka-bay/ In addition, the ruins of an Byzantine fortress from the time of Emperor Justinian (6th century) on the hill above the remains of this settlement are. Out of the settlements there were only rock clumps that point to the arrangement of former houses and buildings. Nearby close to the harbor of Mala Luka, remains of a Liburnian-era shipyard have been found.,https://darkoantolkovic.wordpress.com/2016/05/25/gradina- corinthia/http://www.iarh.hr/en/field-research/archaeological-zone-korintija- bosar-sokol/ The entire area was once under vineyards owned by the Ba≈°ka family Dujmoviƒá. After the Second World War, vineyards were nationalized, and then the days were co-operative, but soon abandoned. Remains of St. Nicholas near Vela Luka In the area between Vela Luka and Mala Luka there are the ruins of the church of St. Nicholas, first mentioned in 1426. It was in bad condition in 1590, and in 1603 it was mentioned that it was without altar and roof. Today there are still all the walls and the apse.  Tourism  Apart from the catering facility in the cove there are no other tourist facilities. In the summer from Ba≈°ka tourists go to the bay via boats taxis. as a rule they bring them in the morning and return to Baska in the evening.

She is known for her research in discrete geometry, geometric probability, and the theory of random graphs. With Alfr√©d R√©nyi and others, she was considered to be one of the members of the Hungarian School of Probability. Contributions In connection to the Erd≈ës distinct distances problem, Pal√°sti studied the existence of point sets for which the ith least frequent distance occurs i times. That is, in such points there is one distance that occurs only once, another distance that occurs exactly two times, a third distance that occurs exactly three times, etc. For instance, three points with this structure must form an isosceles triangle. Any n evenly-spaced points on a line or circular arc also have the same property, but Paul Erd≈ës asked whether this is possible for points in general position (no three on a line, and no four on a circle). Pal√°sti found an eight-point set with this property, and showed that for any number of points between three and eight (inclusive) there is a subset of the hexagonal lattice with this property. Pal√°sti's eight-point example remains the largest known. Another of Pal√°sti's results in discrete geometry concerns the number of triangular faces in an arrangement of lines. When no three lines may cross at a single point, she and Zolt√°n F√ºredi found sets of n lines, subsets of the diagonals of a regular 2n-gon, having n(n-3)/3 triangles. This remains the best lower bound known for this problem, and differs from the upper bound by only O(n) triangles. In geometric probability, Pal√°sti is known for her conjecture on random sequential adsorption, also known in the one-dimensional case as \\"the parking problem\\". In this problem, one places non-overlapping balls within a given region, one at a time with random locations, until no more can be placed. Pal√°sti conjectured that the average packing density in d-dimensional space could be computed as the dth power of the one-dimensional density. Although her conjecture led to subsequent research in the same area, it has been shown to be inconsistent with the actual average packing density in dimensions two through four. Pal√°sti's results in the theory of random graphs include bounds on the probability that a random graph has a Hamiltonian circuit, and on the probability that a random directed graph is strongly connected.

A \\"corporate death penalty‚Äù is the revocation of a corporation's charter for significant harm caused towards society. In some countries there are corporate manslaughter laws, however, almost all countries enable the revocation of a corporate charter. There have been numerous calls in the literature for a \\"corporate death penalty\\". Most recently a study argued that industries that kill more people each year than they employ should have an industry-wide corporate death penalty. Some legal analysis has been done on the idea to revoke corporate charters for environmental violations such as for severe environmental pollution. Actual corporate death penalties in the United States are rarely used. For example, Markoff has shown that no publicly traded company failed because of a conviction that occurred between 2001 and 2010. Companies suggested as deserving the corporate death penalty include Eli Lilly & Company, Equifax, Unocal Corporation, and Wells Fargo. \\"If Volkswagen or other examples in this volume were forced out of existence, this would send a message,\\" John Hulpke wrote in the Journal of Management Inquiry in 2017. One argument against its use is that otherwise innocent employees and shareholders will lose money or their jobs.

Later, the suburb of Frankston came to national attention again as a result of the Frankston serial killings in mid-1993. In 2017, increased rewards were offered for each of the cold cases.  Frankston murders  The first known victim, Allison Rooke (59), disappeared on 30 May 1980, after experiencing trouble with her car. She had told neighbours she was taking a bus to Frankston Shopping Centre to go grocery shopping and see a realtor. The buses travelled along the Frankston-Dandenong Road, which was where Rooke was waiting when she disappeared. On Saturday 5 July, five weeks later, a man walking his dogs found Rooke‚Äôs naked body in a shallow grave, partially hidden by scrubland, on McClelland Drive in Frankston, and a $50,000 reward was soon posted by the police. On Friday 9 October 1981, Frankston North resident Joy Summers (55), heading out for her weekly shopping trip, was waiting for a bus on Frankston-Dandenong Road around 1:20pm when she also vanished. It was the same stretch of road where Rooke had been waiting when she disappeared. Summers' naked corpse was found in scrub by a man collecting firewood near the intersection of McClelland Drive and Skye Road, Frankston, six weeks later on Sunday 22 November.  Tynong North murders  The skeletal remains of Bertha Miller (75), Catherine Headland (14), and Ann-Marie Sargent (18), were found on 6 December 1980 in a sand quarry by men dumping lamb offal on a secluded bush track leading from Brew Road, Tynong North. Miller was fully clothed, but the younger victims were both naked. Miller, a regular churchgoer, had disappeared on Sunday 10 August 1980 on her way to church, while heading to a tram-stop in Glen Iris. Headland (born 1965), an immigrant who had moved to Australia from England in 1966, lived in Berwick when she disappeared on Thursday 28 August while walking to a bus stop for the 11:20am bus to her part-time job at Coles in the Fountain Gate shopping complex. Sargent, unemployed, lived in Cranbourne, when she disappeared on 6 October after travelling from her mother's house to a nearby CES office in Dandenong to claim a benefits cheque. On Thursday 3 February 1983, more human remains were found in Tynong North scrubland, by a man who had stopped to repair a tyre, and a search of the area revealed concealed bones from a badly decomposed and stripped body. The bones were of Narumol Stephenson (34), a Thai mother-of-two who had married an Australian farmer in Thailand in 1978. Arriving in Australia in August 1979, they lived in Deans Marsh, and on a visit to Melbourne, she disappeared in Brunswick from their car around dawn on 30 November 1980 after a fight.  Investigation  Initially, the two investigations were treated separately, although the cases were later linked based on case and MO similarities. Similarities were also drawn to the recent Truro murders in South Australia. According to police at the time, all of the victims were on foot, with most of them planning to use public transport at the time they disappeared. A few may have tried to hitchhike. Given the lack of eyewitnesses to anything suspicious, authorities assumed that the victims probably knew or trusted their abductor. Causes of death could not be identified, and most bodies were stripped of possessions. Around 2000 interviews were held regarding the case, and later investigators speculated the possibility of two or three separate offenders. The prime suspect in the case, Harold Janman, who \\"often offered women lifts on the Frankston-Dandenong Road\\", continued to maintained his innocence. Janman died aged 88 in August 2020. No-one has been charged regarding the murders, which remain unsolved. In October 2017, the police announced six separate $1 million rewards (up from the original $50,000) for any information that resulted in an arrest in any of the cases.

She set the record on September 16, 2018, at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, by traveling an average of 183.932 mph (296.009 km/h) on a custom- built carbon KHS bicycle behind a custom-built vehicle to minimize air resistance. The previous record, , was set in 1995 by Dutchman Fred Rompelberg. Two years earlier she set the women's bicycle land speed record, pedaling 147.7 mph (237.7 km/h). She is the first and only woman in history to hold the world record, which was first established in 1899. Early life and education Denise Mueller was born into a family of daredevils. Her father, Myron Mueller, was an ultra-distance cyclist; he celebrated his 70th birthday by pedaling the entire perimeter of the coterminous United States, a distance of more than . He is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest person to bicycle that perimeter. Her mother, Anna Dement, raced midget demolition-derby cars. \\"In our family, crazy is our sort of normal,\\" Denise said. She graduated from San Dieguito High School. Career Mueller competed as a junior cyclist in her teens and finished in the top three in national and world competitions more than a dozen times. She won national championships in road, track and mountain biking 15 times. She retired in 1992 at age 19. She went to work for her family's security company, eventually becoming president and CEO. In 2009, Mueller-Korenek resumed bicycling and running, competing in marathons and Ironman Triathlon competitions. Her trainer, both in her teens and later, is John Howard, a three-time Olympian and holder of the world speed record before Rompelberg. Mueller-Korenek decided to go for the speed record when Howard told her no woman had ever attempted it. She began seriously training to set a new bicycle speed record in 2012. Along the way she won two national titles for her age group. In 2016, she made her first run at the record at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Her speed of established the women's world record.

One person was killed and 30,000 were forced to evacuate their homes. Background According to the NTSB's preliminary report, customers in the accident area received gas from a low-pressure (0.5 psi) distribution network which, in turn, was fed from a high-pressure (75 psi) main pipeline via regulators controlled by sensors measuring pressure in the low-pressure pipes. At the time of the accident, workers were replacing some of the low-pressure piping, but the procedure set out by Columbia Gas for doing this failed to include transfer of a regulator's pressure sensor from the old, disused piping to the new. As a result, when the old pipe was depressurized, the regulator sensed zero pressure on the low-pressure side and opened completely, feeding the main pipeline's full pressure into the local distribution network.  Fires and explosions  One of the damaged homes The faulty procedure used caused natural gas to build up in homes within a matter of minutes. Multiple explosions and fires were reported over a very short period of time in the towns of Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover beginning about 4:15pm (EDT). Through the evening emergency crews responded to between 40 and 80 fires. At one time, as many as 18 fires were burning at once, and Andover officials struck a maximum 10-alarm response. Andover's fire chief described \\"billows of smoke coming from Lawrence behind me, I could see plumes of smoke in front of me within the town of Andover, it just looked like an absolute war zone.\\" A Lawrence resident described finding his boiler on fire after his smoke alarm went off; as he was extinguishing it he heard a boom from a neighbor's house and the ground shook. An explosion at one of the homes involved caused the house to shift off of its foundation. This in turn caused the chimney attached to fall on a car occupied by a fleeing resident, killing him. In addition to this death, twenty-five others were reported injured overall from the whole event. All of the fires were put out by 6:45pm. Once it was realized that the fires were being caused by over-pressurized gas mains, all residents supplied by Columbia Gas in the area were told to evacuate their homes. Foul play was also ruled out as a possible cause by police. Gas service for approximately 8,000 residents was ultimately shut off; electricity to portions of the three communities was also interrupted to avoid igniting any lingering gas.  Response  Thousands of people were told to shut off their gas service and evacuate their homes. In Lawrence, Mayor Dan Rivera urged residents in the city to move north of the Merrimack River. Schools and senior citizen centers were opened up in all three areas to take in the evacuees, and hotels offered shelter as well. The number of people evacuating by vehicle soon caused gridlock on streets that were already experiencing congestion by the afternoon rush hour commute. Merrimack College evacuated its buildings temporarily. Schools and state offices in the three communities remained closed the following day. First responders from as far away as Boston and Manchester, New Hampshire, rushed to Lawrence, Andover, and North Andover as gas and electric lines were shut off to prevent further explosions. The NTSB also sent a team to investigate the situation the following day stating that they were going to look at the design of the pipeline system, maintenance associated with it, the emergency response, and the integrity management system of Columbia Gas. The gas company involved released several updates about the fires and explosions through their website. The updates expressed sympathy over the \\"tragic incident\\" and the resulting death, as well as directing readers to shelters, and how to remain safe throughout the incident. Governor Baker and Lawrence mayor Dan Rivera were later heavily critical of the response issued by Columbia Gas. On September 14, 2018, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency and appointed Eversource to evaluate and oversee the management of the gas distribution system in the affected area. Residents were gradually able to return to their homes and businesses, but others still remained in emergency shelters, hotels, or with friends and family. Officials entered each residence and business with the help of a locksmith if necessary, inspected for trapped gas, and ensured that the gas line from the street was turned off. Eventually lists were posted of streets that had been cleared, and electricity was gradually restored to these residents and businesses.UPDATE: More Andover, North Andover residents going home; Lawrence still in holding pattern Inspections were complete and electricity to all affected areas was restored by September 16, 2018.Pressure inside Columbia Gas pipes was 12 times higher than normal Some gas-dependent businesses, such as laundromats and restaurants, remained unable to open. Recovery Restoration of gas service to the 8,600 affected customers required the replacement of about of gas pipeline, which Columbia Gas expected to accomplish by November 19, 2018.National Guard members are delivering hot plates to residents in Lawrence On September 22, 2018, National Guard troops began delivering about 7,000 hot plates to customers to temporarily replace gas stoves for cooking. There were plans to deliver about 24,000 space heaters before the cold weather arrived, with Columbia Gas paying the increased electrical bills, but no plans to make up for lack of hot showers due to disabled water heaters. The company also withdrew a $33 million rate increase which was scheduled to take effect on November 1, 2018. In late October, the company pushed back the expected completion date to December 16. Replacement of gas mains was proceeding ahead of schedule, but some older houses were unable to accommodate newer appliances and required more work to upgrade them to current standards. Costs and legal action In early May 2019, NiSource, the parent company of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, said third-party claims related to the Merrimack Valley gas disaster could cost greater than $1 billion. This amount includes property damage, personal injury, infrastructure damage and mutual aid payments to other utilities that helped in the recovery and restoration efforts. Multiple class action lawsuits were filed for negligence and destruction of property; these were eventually all settled by Columbia Gas for $143 million in July 2019. The settlement included $80 million for the affected communities, and a separate payment to the family of the deceased. In February 2020, Columbia Gas plead guilty to violating federal pipeline safety laws, and under an agreement with the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney's Office, agreed to sell its gas distribution operations in the state and pay a fine of $53 million. Columbia Gas was sentenced on June 23, 2020, and ordered to pay the $53 million fine as well as serve a three-year probation.

Hughes was in fourth spot on the Coalition ticket for the 2010 half-Senate election. She was in the tenth spot on the Coalition ticket for the 2015 Legislative Council election. In 2016, she was set to be in the first spot on the Coalition ticket for the anticipated half-Senate election, ahead of Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, but when a double dissolution election was called, she was nominated in sixth spot on the Coalition ticket for the double dissolution election. As of 2017, Hughes had spent a decade on the State Executive of the Liberal Party of Australia and attained the position of Country Vice-President of the State Party during this tenure. Hughes was described by ABC News as a \\"regional powerbroker\\" of the party, advocating for the people of rural New South Wales, whose political views were centre-right, with a particular focus on issues pertaining to rural Australia, and garnering support for people living with disabilities. The Liberal Party described her as a \\"passionate advocate for rural and regional New South Wales, having led campaigns to improve transport options and health services for the bush\\". She is the founder and chair of the Country Autism Network, an association created with the intention of facilitating greater community awareness and developing more sophisticated support mechanisms for regional families and children affected by autism. Hughes began the network following the diagnosis of her middle child with autism, recognising a lack of support and relevant information available to families in regional areas regarding the condition. Hughes has worked in the private sector as a senior consultant for the Human Resources consultancy Salt & Shein. After ostensibly failing to be elected to the Senate in 2016, Hughes was appointed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where she worked in part-time capacity. In 2017, when Senator Fiona Nash was found to be ineligible, making Hughes likely to be found to be her replacement, Hughes resigned from this position in an attempt to prevent herself from being found ineligible. =Parliamentary eligibility crisis= At the 2016 double dissolution election, Hughes ran for the Senate to represent New South Wales, in the sixth position on the Coalition ticket, which was considered to be unwinnable. However, during the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, Senator Fiona Nash of the National Party was found to be ineligible to sit in the senate under Section 44(i) of the Constitution due to being a British Citizen. Hughes, as the first unelected candidate on the Coalition's New South Wales ticket, was expected to be declared elected upon a countback of New South Wales Senate votes that excluded Nash. On 1 July 2017, long after the 2016 federal election, Hughes was appointed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, a government body which provides autonomous assessment of decisions made by Australian administrative bodies including the Department of Immigration, Department of Home Affairs and Department of Human Services. Under Section 44(iv) of the Constitution, Disqualification. any person who \\"[h]olds any office of profit under the Crown\\" is \\"incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator\\", with her position on the Tribunal being such an office. 45 minutes after the ruling that Nash was ineligible was handed down, Hughes resigned from her position on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, in an attempt to ensure her eligibility for election to the Senate. After the countbacks conducted as a result of the High Court's judgement in the Citizenship Seven case selected replacements for the disqualified senators, while the High Court immediately declared other selected candidates elected, the High Court decided to first further investigate Hughes' own eligibility due to her position on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Court had to determine whether Hughes' subsequent resignation from the position on the Tribunal would render her eligible, or whether this resignation was ineffective in terms of remedying her prior ineligibility for parliament. High Court decision On 27 October 2017, the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, considered issues raised by the Senate referring to Section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The primary issues of contention were the timing of Hughes' appointment to the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the subsequent recount which took place. In the judgement, delivered by Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justices Virginia Bell, Stephen Gageler, Patrick Keane and James Edelman, the court noted that the prevailing issue was \\"whether holding that disqualifying office during the discrete period between 1 July and 27 October was enough to render Ms Hughes incapable of being chosen\\". In an affidavit submitted to the Court by Hughes' solicitor, it was submitted that at the date of the 2016 election, Hughes held no such position and was thus eligible to be nominated, despite her subsequent appointment to the tribunal. The issue facing the Court was whether Hughes' appointment in 2017 had occurred during the \\"election period\\" and thus whether she held an office of profit under the crown prior to or during the process of her being chosen as a Senator. The High Court found Hughes to be ineligible for election as a senator in parliament, ruling that the period during which she held the position on the tribunal was technically a part of the election period. The summons made by the attorney general for Hughes to be declared duly elected to the Senate, following the special count, was dismissed. Considering Hughes' appointment as a part-time member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 1 July 2017, the Court held that the position made her \\"incapable of being chosen\\" under Section 44(iv) of the Commonwealth Constitution. The court explicitly acknowledged the \\"harsh and technical\\" nature of the judgement, with reference to how Hughes' appointment was understandable given the nature of the position and the remuneration which accompanied it. However, the voluntary means by which she accepted the position, and the circumstances where disqualification was always a possibility, meant that the terms of section 44 of the Constitution meant that she was incapable of being chosen for the Senate. The \\"voluntary step\\" taken by Hughes, in accepting a government job, meant that she effectively relinquished \\"the opportunity to benefit in the future from any special count of the ballot papers.\\" Following the judgement, Hughes lamented a lost opportunity to represent the people of rural Australia. The decision fuelled debate around the Court's approach to Section 44 of the Constitution, with the Attorney-General George Brandis noting the ambiguity which surrounded the decision. The principle which emerged is that if a public servant runs for office, loses the election but may be eligible to replace a vacancy subsequently created in the parliamentary term, they should not return to their profession as this will forfeit any potential to fill a future vacancy. =Subsequent career= After her involvement in the eligibility crisis, her political involvement with the Liberal Party was somewhat diminished, but she retained her position on the NSW State Executive of the Party, and pursued alternative professional interests in the private sector. In June 2018, it was revealed that Hughes had been ousted from the Liberal Party, as it was revealed that although she held the position of Country Vice President, she was living on the North Shore of Sydney, raising questions as to the validity of her appointment. /> In November 2018, Hughes won the most votes in the Liberal Party's Senate preselection ballot for the 2019 federal election. She was ranked first on the Coalition's Senate ticket in New South Wales. She and runner-up Andrew Bragg outpolled an incumbent senator, Jim Molan, who has been placed in the \\"unwinnable\\" fourth position on the ticket (below the National Party's candidate).  Personal life  Hughes has spent the majority of her adult life living in regional New South Wales, with her family life being predominantly spent on a farm west of Moree, where she resides with her husband Stewart and three children. Her middle son has been diagnosed with autism.

It was designed by the NSW Public Works Department and built by the department in 1900. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  The sewer vent and cottage were built in 1900. The Corunna Road site is one of only two sewer vents in New South Wales to feature accommodation facilities. The cottage was originally leased to Water Board employees responsible for the maintenance of the vent. The cottage was renovated by Sydney Water as part of the Heritage Assets Project, which saw the demolition of the dilapidated rear kitchen, and the installation of a new contemporary kitchen, hallway, dining room, laundry and bathroom. It also saw a new skillion roof installed at the rear of the cottage, new walls, floor and ceiling, French doors, services, and the restoration of the yard. The cottage was sold at auction by Sydney Water in 2017 for $1,405,000. The adjacent sewer vent remains owned by Sydney Water following the cottage sale.  Description  The structure comprises a brick and terracotta detailed vent shaft with rendered base and cap some 15 metres in height. With the adjoining Queen Anne revival workers cottage, the vent is integral to the design of the place as it forms part of the front fence in brick and stone detailing with wrought iron gates and fence pickets. Construction details are substantially intact. The cottage comprises a single storey detached dwelling with all original details in generally including turned timber verandah posts and verandah detail; Timber joinery; and Marseilles pattern terracotta tiles, all of which appears to be substantially intact. Further original details of the cottage include a rendered and lined ashlar wall to the side lane and rendered label moulds above the window heads. Evidence of shutters via shutter flaps remain but shutters have been removed. The cottage backs on to a rear lane which is fenced by a timber paling fence in fair to poor condition. Relatively new steel straps have been fitted to the shaft for stability which has some impact on the visual aesthetics of the shaft, however the quality and detailing of the shaft remains as an excellent example of the brick masons craft complete with entasis. What sets this shaft apart from others is the neo-classical terracotta console brackets at the capital of the shaft which is an excellent detail and example of its type. The stone detail on the shaft is inscribed \\"Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage 1900\\" and is in itself in poor condition continuing to exfoliate. The vent and cottage are located on the corner of a lane, and the vent is a prominent landmark within the local vicinity, particularly to the east along Corunna Road.  Heritage listing  The vent and cottage are an increasingly rare survivor of an excellent example of the brick and stonemasons craft associated with Sydney Water in the early part of the 20th century. It is one of a handful of like structures in the Sydney Water System, and in comparison to other similar examples is of State significance. It is a visual landmark in the cultural landscape of the local area. Sewer Vent and Cottage was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The vent and cottage are tangible evidence of the historical provision of sewerage services to the inner Western Suburbs of Sydney which form part of a much grander sewage system. The vent with the cottage as a couple are rare evidence of the historical values of quality design and facilities for Board workers and the Board itself. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. A highly visible landmark with rare terracotta detailing. It is a prominent element and one which relates well to its historic streetscape. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. It is likely to be of value to the members of local community as a prominent landmark and for the function it serves in provision of sewerage services for the community. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. An excellent example of brick masons trade in the precision of such detail including entasis of the shaft. The vent shaft plays an important technical role in the provision of fresh air for the system and as such is a highly significant element to the sewer system. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. As a combination of cottage and vent shaft this example is one of a couple in Sydney Water System and in the detail displayed probably unique in NSW. The vent shaft itself is one of a group of like shafts built by the Board at the time which collectively The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The cottage in overall design is representative of Queen Anne detail buildings of a good quality throughout Sydney.

History Anton Michelsen Anton Michelsen (1809‚Äì1877) was born 1809 in Copenhagen. His family, which can be traced back to the 17th century, had for generations been metalsmiths. He completed a goldsmith's apprenticeship in Odense in 1839 before moving to Copenhagen where he continued his training in Dyrkoph's and court goldsmith J.B. Dalhoff's workshops. He also attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where he was influenced by Gustav Friedrich Hetsch. In 1836, he went on a long journey abroad, working in some of the leading goldsmithies in Germany and Paris. He established his own goldsmithy in Gothersgade in Copenhagen when he returned to Denmark in 1841. He immediately won the attention of the royal family. Christian VIII charged him with executing all Danish orders with title of royal court and order jeweller (kgl. hof- og ordensjuvelerer).

Her son Teddy (Judah Lewis) has started stealing cars. Her younger daughter Kate (Darby Camp) nevertheless is trying to keep Christmas spirit alive. On Christmas Eve, Claire is forced to fill in for a coworker, leaving Teddy to look after Kate. While watching old Christmas videos, Kate notices a strange arm appear out of the fireplace. Kate believes this is Santa Claus and blackmails Teddy to help her prove it is him. The two set up a makeshift trip wire and a hidden camera. Kate is later woken up and sees Santa in the living room. However, he escapes to the roof. The two children follow. Kate decides to hide in his sleigh to get a closer look, and Teddy reluctantly follows her. Santa rides off with the kids in tow. When Kate decides to make her presence known, Santa and the reindeer are startled and he loses control of the sleigh. After teleporting to Chicago, Illinois, the sleigh breaks down, causing the reindeer to scatter and Santa‚Äôs hat and bag of presents to be lost. Santa (Kurt Russell) introduces himself to the kids, and tells them that he has to get back to delivering presents as soon as possible or else Christmas Spirit will be gone. Without his hat, Santa can not move quickly or through tight spaces like he does. The kids are forced to help him after he threatens to list them as bad kids permanently. They stop at a bar where Santa tries to seek help from the patrons. When they get no assistance, they steal a car, which itself was already stolen by the bartender. They locate the reindeer but encounter a police car driven by police officers Dave Poveda (Martin Roach) and Mikey Jameson (Lamorne Morris). Kate goes after the reindeer by herself while Teddy and Santa lure the police away. Santa is arrested, while Kate and Teddy escape with the reindeer. The kids find Santa‚Äôs bag, and Kate goes inside to find help. She is teleported to the North Pole where she encounters Santa‚Äôs elves, who agree to help her. Meanwhile, Teddy is attacked by a group of thugs who take him and the bag to their hideout, but he is saved by Kate and the elves, who set out to repair Santa‚Äôs sleigh. At the police precinct, Santa tries to explain his situation to Officer Poveda. When Santa reveals his wish this year is to reconcile with his ex-wife Lisa, who also shares that wish, Poveda is taken aback, but still refuses to believe him. Poveda has Santa locked in the holding cell, though he becomes suspicious when he sees a larger number of arrests than usual on Christmas Eve. Seeing that Christmas Spirit has gotten too low, Santa gathers all the inmates to perform \\"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\\", which works amongst all the officers except Poveda. Poveda is finally convinced when he receives a call from Lisa, who invites him out for coffee in the morning, and agrees to let Santa go. One of the elves arrives through the air vent to give Santa a spare hat. Santa goes outside to find his sleigh repaired. Santa sees that he only has an hour until morning to complete delivering presents, so the kids agree to help him. Santa is able to deliver all the presents, saving Christmas. Santa drops the kids off back at their home before their mother returns. Santa gives Teddy his hat as a memento, showing that he did not really need it. When he leaves, he gives Kate a \\"Ho, Ho, Ho\\", a saying he previously stated was an urban myth about him. When Claire returns, they go inside to find the living room decorated like their father used to. They start opening presents, When they get to Santa's gifts, Kate gets the skateboard she asked for, while Teddy gets a magic ornament. When Teddy hangs it on the tree, he sees his dad magically appear in his reflection, and they both express pride in each other. Back in the North Pole, Santa reunites with Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn).

In the late 1950s, the UNE became increasingly leftist as Brazil's political situation became more polarized. The Brazilian military dictatorship that came to power after a coup in 1964 directly challenged students' rights to political activity. The government's anti- democratic policies and attempt to suppress student political activity incited mass student mobilization in protest of the dictatorship. As student demonstration increased, the government escalated its repression of protestors. Police and students repeatedly engaged in violent clashes. The student movement peaked in 1968 when students engaged in intense national protests, strikes, and occupied universities. The government increasingly arrested and tortured students and professors suspected of being leftist or associated with communist groups. By the end of 1968, the government passed legislation that eliminated the ability of students to contest the government and ended the student movement.  Political background and UNE formation  During the First Brazilian Republic, Brazilian students enjoyed relative political authority within Brazilian society. Because students were primarily male and children of Brazil's economic and political elite, the government viewed their education and political activism as preparation for their future roles as Brazilian leaders. Throughout the early 1900s, students had the freedom to participate in political movements specific to student issues, Brazilian politics, and international politics, such as U.S. intervention in Panama. After a military coup in 1930, Get√∫lio Vargas assumed the presidency, his policies had an effect on student political mobilization. The Vargas administration began to expand Brazil's university system and mandated the formation of officially recognized student organizations at each university that allowed the students the right to politically organize. Inspired by Vargas policies, students launched an effort to create a student organization that operated nationally. In 1937, Brazilian students held a national conference at which they voted to establish the National Union of Students (Brazil), known as the UNE, which was a democratic student organization run by elected representatives from universities throughout Brazil. The formation of the UNE allowed Brazilian students more political mobility than before and gave them political autonomy from their parents and university administration. Throughout the 1900s, the UNE was primarily a leftist organization, but due to its democratic nature, periodically shifted its political alignment depending on its elected leaders and the Brazilian political climate. At times, its policies aligned with socialist agendas but it also experienced a brief conservative shift in the 50s. By 1955, however, the UNE was decidedly leftist and organized several national strikes throughout the latter half of the 1950s and early 60s, including a national strike against high trolley fairs, a strike against strict entrance exams to the universities, and a push to democratize university leadership.  Transition to student political repression  In the early sixties, the attitude toward student political mobilization changed. In the wake of the Cuban Revolution, and given the global political climate of the Cold War, conservative political forces began to fear the emergence of revolutionary groups within Brazil. They feared that leftist organizations, including the Brazilian Student Movement, were being infiltrated by communist revolutionaries. Student political mobilization became viewed as a threat to Brazil's internal national security. At the same time, student organizations were also inspired by the reforms of the Cuban Revolution. Student movements in Brazil became more radical as they pushed for policies modeled after the Cuban example such as agrarian reform and literacy campaigns. With the radicalization of the student movement came conservative movements aimed at curbing student political power. These conservative organizations promoted the narrative that by being politically active, students were not fulfilling their roles as actual students, and also furthered the narrative that foreign communists infiltrated organizations like the UNE. These organizations coupled their disdain for leftist movements with criticisms of the left-leaning president, Jo√£o Goulart, who was pushing for liberal reforms and whose liberal policies were blamed for inciting the growing radicalization of youth. In the final months of 1964, tensions within Brazilian society were high as Brazilian society became sharply divided between the right and the left.  Student resistance under the military dictatorship  On March 13, 1964, Goulart passed a law that nationalized Brazilian oil companies and established an agrarian reform initiative. With discontent growing in response to these liberal reforms, the military staged a coup and overthrew Goulart on March 30th with U.S. approval. The military claimed the 1964 Brazilian coup d'√©tat was meant to protect Brazil from destabilization due to perceived communist threats. The initial reactions by Brazilian society and many Brazilian students, save a few extreme leftist members of the UNE, was apathy. The new military government had little tolerance for student dissent. The government quickly acted to limit students ability to be politically active by shutting down all student organization and beginning to arrest students and professors suspected of being communist. In 1964, the government passed an act called Lei Suplicy, which officially dissolved the UNE and replaced it with a non-democratic student organization that was directly under government control. The UNE's physical building was also burned to the ground during the coup as an intimidation tactic. These repressive measures were a significant blow for student organizations, but clandestinely in 1996, the UNE reestablished with an overtly anti-government agenda. In 1966, the clandestine UNE was able to organize an anti-government strike followed by a protest called the \\"National Day of Protest Against the Dictatorship\\". This protest was in response to increasingly repressive government measures. Earlier attempts at student mobilization had been met with police violence and student arrests. These protesters demanded the release of student prisoners, a repeal of Lei Suplicy, and the suspension of university professors suspected of being communist. At one protest of this national movement at a medical school in Rio de Janeiro, students were met with police violence.  Notable demonstrations and conflict in 1968  After the coup, the government met increasing student unrest with increasing violence. Students viewed the government as increasingly undemocratic and repressive, so they responded by escalating their resistance. Students were also influenced to mobilize because the dictatorship's policies were directly influencing the quality and accessibility of Brazilian education. In particular, students were angry that there was not enough space in Brazilian schools to accommodate all students that had passed the entrance exam. In 1968, student unrest reached its peak and mass protests struck the nation. The incident that incited the unrest was the murder of a poor student name Edson Lu√≠s de Lima Souto during a student protest in Rio. Students in a cafeteria were protesting the poor quality of state-run university cafeterias when police intervened violently, killing the young student. His body was taken to the statehouse in protests and massive demonstrations followed. In particular, University students organized his funeral, which turned into an anti- dictatorship demonstration with over 50,000 attendees. After this incident, student and police clashes became increasingly violent. Students would arm themselves with rocks, Molotov cocktails, and other makeshift weapons and barricade university buildings from police. Police killed more students when repressing increasingly violent protests. Students organized a march with labor parties and civilians that had over 100,000 participants. This demonstration was significant because it included many participants of different political alignments that joined together in protests of the military dictatorship.  End of the student movement  During the latter half of 1968, government repression intensified. The government increasingly arrested and tortured students and professors for any suspected allegiance to leftist organizations. In August, the military occupied The University of Brasilia. In October of that year, the police invaded the clandestine UNE conference. Over 700 UNE members and students were arrested, effectively removing most of the student movement's leaders. The final blow to the student movement came when the government issued Institutional Act Number Five, which essentially eliminated all civil liberties guaranteed by the Brazilian government and legalized censorship, state surveillance, and cemented the military's uncontested authority. This essentially prevented students from continuing to protesting the government through any means. Throughout the 70s, above ground student resistance movements were practically nonexistent.
