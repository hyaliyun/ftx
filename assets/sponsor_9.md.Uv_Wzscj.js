History The band was founded by musical actress and rock performer Chryso and composer/keyboardist Elias Pero (Sovereign), but eventually Chrysilia evolved to a band with a full debut album. In the initial stages of the project, producer and multi-instrumentalist Bob Katsionis (Firewind, Outloud) played a major role in the formation of the band. He arranged and produced most of the album, together with Elias Pero, Jim Loop and John Skalkotos, and he also composed one of the album‚Äôs songs, \\"The Fifth Season\\", which is based on his solo work. The debut album \\"Et in Arcadia ego\\" was released by Finland's Lion Music in October 2017. It is a concept album inspired by Arcadia (utopia) as it is depicted in the Renaissance. The album, having worldwide distribution, has been received with excellent reviews internationally, having been compared quality-wise to the likes of Avantasia, Ayreon, Eluveitie and Nightwish. It is regarded as one of 2017's best metal albums, based on the cinematic complexity behind apparently catchy tunes and characterized by Chryso's voice, that has been compared to the genre's best. In the album, Chrysilia paid their tributes to one of Greece's extreme metal flagships, Rotting Christ, covering a black metal track in an alternative, folk/symphonic way. After the album‚Äôs live release event with progsters SL Theory, Chrysilia were invited to play live in prime shows in Greece and Europe, including Voices of the Mist in Athens and the FemME festival in Eindhoven, NL. Chrysilia's live shows have been praised as being dynamic, dramatic and professional. Chrysilia have chosen to visualize most of their songs, having five official video clips to date. On December 6th 2018, Chrysilia was confirmed as a special guest for the Athens show of British rock legends Uriah Heep. The band's line-up currently consists of Chryso, Harry Polymeneas, Nick Teteris and Thanos. On December 12th, 2019, the second full album was announced for a 2020 release, under the production of Devon Graves (Psychotic Waltz).

Design and development The Cytrynka was the last and most successful of three gliders designed and built by the youthful 'Start' Aviation Circle in Warsaw. El≈ºanowski developed its design between 1929 and 1930. Constructed in the Circle's workshop, it was funded by the Warsaw Aeroclub. It was a high wing monoplane with a two part, rectangular plan wing, built around two spars and largely fabric covered apart from a plywood covered leading edge. Aft of the wing trailing edge the fuselage was an open Warren girder, stiffened by wire bracing from the wings, but the forward part was a rectangular-section plywood structure. This provided a conventional open cockpit for the pilot's seat and controls rather than the totally exposed position of many open-frame designs. The Cytrynka's tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage frame and braced to its lower chord with a strut on each side. It carried balanced elevators. There was no fin but its rectangular rudder reached upwards from the lower chord well above the elevators, operating in a cut-out. Operational history There is uncertainty as to whether the Cytrynka flew late in 1930 or was delayed by winter to the following spring. Cynk dates the first flight to October 1930 at Bezmiechowa but Glass has May 1931. It was then used by its Warsaw Aeroclub sponsors at Bezmiechova to train pilots. In September 1931 they took it as a reserve aircraft on an expedition to Polichno which led to the formation of a gliding club there.

Meliboea is shown to the centre right in Magnesia. Meliboea or Meliboia () was a town and polis (city-state) of Magnesia in ancient Thessaly, mentioned by Homer, in the Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad, as one of the places subject to Philoctetes. It was situated upon the sea coast,Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 25 and is described by Livy as situated at the roots of Mount Ossa, and by Strabo as lying in the gulf between Mount Ossa and Mount Pelion. The town was famous for its purple dye.Lucretius, De rerum natura 2.499; Virgil, Aeneid 5.251. Even down to the 19th century, the shellfish from which the purple dye is obtained were found off the coast of Thessaly. Herodotus mentions it as the place where several Persian ships under command of Xerxes I crashed during a storm, prior to the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BCE), while other Persian ships crashed adjacent to Sepias and others in front of Casthanaea. During the Roman-Seleucid War, it was one of the Thessalian cities that in the year 191 BCE, being held by Athamanians, was taken by a joint army of the Roman Marcus Baebius Tamphilus and Philip V of Macedon. It was conquered by the Romans in 168 BCE and plundered. Meliboea was taken and plundered by the Romans under Gnaeus Octavius in 168 BCE. Meliboea is also mentioned by Strabo, Stephanus of Byzantium, Pomponius Mela, and Pliny the Elder. Its exact location is unknown, but it is usually located near the modern Agia, at the place called Kastro Velika, located in the community of Velika, municipal unit of Melivoia, which echoes the ancient name.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time, while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were less common due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 240 mod√®le 93/96 started life as eight Canon de 240 de c√¥te mod√®le 1893 coastal defense guns that were removed from fortifications at Dakar in Senegal and Saigon in Vietnam. Because of this, the guns were often referred to as \\"colonies\\" mounts. The eight gun barrels were placed on the existing rail carriages for the Canon de 305 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ manufactured by the firm of St Chamond. The carriages were originally deployed in 1916 but it was too much gun for too little carriage so the barrels were replaced with barrels by St Chamond and entered service in 1918. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The guns sat on a top carriage traversing mount which sat on a large diameter geared steel ring. A rectangular steel firing platform sat on top of the platform with the barrel of the gun overhanging the platform at the front with an overhanging loading platform for the gunners to the rear. The firing platform was then traversed by a worm gear which attached to the base. To load the gun the barrel was lowered and there was an elevated shell handling trolley at the rear. The guns had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system where the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined +4¬∞ rear deck which helped return the gun to battery after firing. The gun could be elevated between +15¬∞ to +35¬∞ when firing across the tracks but was limited to +29¬∞ when parallel because the breach of the gun would not have enough room to recoil without hitting the carriage. The carriages consisted of rectangular steel bases, which were suspended on two railroad bogies. Each bogie had six axles. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. Since the barrels were coastal defense guns that were not intended for use at high angles of elevation the trunnions were relocated relatively far forward and the guns were nose heavy. The carriage used ground platform anchoring and site preparation included laying wooden beams parallel to the tracks then splicing in a section of rail bed reinforced with wooden beams under the center which the carriage was lowered onto. Outriggers and ground anchors were also used to stabilize the gun once in firing position as well as five screw jacks. Although the mount was capable to 360¬∞ of traverse it was often limited to 10¬∞ left/right of the centerline because of problems with balance and recoil which hampered the earlier Canon de 305 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ. For this reason, the weapon was not considered a success.  Coastal Defense  The eight Canon de 240 mod√®le 93/96 TAZ guns remained in reserve between the two world wars and were mobilized during 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. Four guns were assigned to the 10th and 11th Heavy Artillery Batteries of the 374¬∞ Regiment of the ALVF (Artillerie Lourde sur Voie Ferr√©e) in the South of France facing the Italians. After the French surrender, the guns were assigned the German designations 24 cm Kanone (E) 558 (f) or 24 cm Kanone (E) Model 93/96 (f). In German service, they reverted to their coastal defense role and in 1942 they were integrated into Germany's Atlantic Wall defenses. Four guns were located at St. Nazaire in France while another four were located in Norway first at Narvik from 1942-44 and later at Naerbo from 1944-45.

It took the form of a mass uprising of students and workers, attracting people from every profession. The uprising took place from early November 1968, to the end of March 1969, around 10 to 15 million people were involved. The movement resulted in the regime of Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan) being brought down.  Background  Since the nation's birth in 1947, Pakistan had been governed though bureaucracy. In 1958, the army seized power through a coup led by Ayub Khan. Under his rule, the country's economy grew at an average yearly rate of more than 5%. However, due to income inequality, Pakistan became a country with extreme wealth and extreme poverty. Ayub Khan's policies nourished the capitalist class, whose fortunes amassed, but it oppressed ordinary people with increasing material poverty, as well as intellectual poverty due to rigorous political and cultural censorship. On April 21, 1968, Dr. Mahbub ul Haq, the then Chief Economist of the Planning Commission, identified Pakistan's 22 richest families that controlled 66 percent of the industries and owned 87 percent shares in the country's banking and insurance industry. Similarly, the Ayub regime implemented its own version of land reforms, under which a limit was imposed upon land holding. However, it failed miserably, and over 6,000 landowners exceeded his defined ceilings, owning 7.5 million acres of land. The average income in West Pakistan was a mere ¬£35 per year; in East Pakistan, the figure was lower at ¬£15. In 1965, presidential elections were held. These elections were not based upon adult franchise but on basic democracy. A few thousand so-called elected representatives of local bodies had to elect the president. There were wide speculations of election interference which also led to the opposition's protest. That same year, Pakistan went to war with India. The costs of the war put an end to economic growth and saw massive increase in defence spending. Private investment growth in Pakistan saw 20% decline in the following years.  Movement '68  In the early months of 1968, Ayub Khan celebrated what was called the \\"Decade of Development\\", outraged citizens erupted into agitations. In response to the \\"Decade of Development\\" in early week of October 1968 the National Students Federation (associated with the Maoists faction of the Communist Party of West Pakistan started demands weeks and started a protest campaign to expose the so called \\"development\\". Demands week started on 7 October 1968 and the first demonstration took place in front of board of secondary education,Karachi. The movement spread across the country when later in November a group of students from Rawalpindi were heading back from Landi Kotal, and were stopped at customs checkpoints near Attock. They were aggressively met by customs officials. On returning to Rawalpindi, they staged a protest against their mishandling by police as result of their experience. Protests grew to a sizeable amount, resulting in the police trying to dismantle the protests and shots being fired. A student of Rawalpindi Polytechnic College, Abdul Hameed, was shot dead. Already, outraged citizens were protesting against a rise in the price of sugar; the death of Hameed sparked the whole society and workers to join. Prominent writer Tariq Ali narrates incident in following words; > Without any physical provocation the police, who were fully armed with > rifles, batons, and tear-gas bombs, opened fire. One bullet hit Abdul Hamid, > a first-year student aged seventeen, who died on the spot. Enraged, the > students fought back with bricks and paving stones, and there were > casualties on both sides. In February and March 1968, a wave of strikes occurred in the country. On February 13, for the first time in ten years, the red flag was hauled up in Lahore, as more than 25,000 rail workers marched along the main street chanting: \\"Solidarity with the Chinese people: Destroy capitalism.\\" However, there was no mass Marxist party to provide leadership. In the industrial district of Faisalabad, the district administration had to seek the permission of a local labor leader named Mukhtar Rana for the supply of goods through trucks. All censorship failed. Trains were carrying the revolutionary messages across the country. Workers invented new methods of communication. It was the industrialisation, exploitation, and oppression widening the gulf between rich and poor which brought this change. In an interview for the book, Pakistan's Other Story-The 1968‚Äì69 Revolution, Munnu Bhai revealed some anecdotes of the upsurge. \\"At a public meeting in Ichra, Lahore, Jamaat-e-Islami leader Maulana Maudoodi held a piece of bread in his one hand and the Holy Koran in the other. He asked the crowd, 'Do you want roti (bread) or the Koran?' The people had replied, 'We have the Koran in our homes, but we don't have bread.' \\" According to the telegraphic narration of the events of those days in Mubashar Hasan's book, The crises of Pakistan and their solution. > \\"In this movement, a total of 239 people were killed, 196 in East Pakistan > and 43 in West Pakistan. According to details police firing killed 41 in > West Pakistan and 88 in East Pakistan. Most of them were students. In East > Pakistan, they included Asad, Matiur, Anwar, Rostom, Dr. Shamsuzzoha and > Sergeant Zahrul Huq\\". By early 1969, the movement was joined by peasant committees and organisations in the country's rural areas. In March 1969, a group of senior military men advised Ayub to step down, fearing the eruption of a full-scale civil war in East Pakistan and the political and social anarchy in the country's west wing. Even Ayub Khan conceded how the movement had paralysed the functioning of the state and society. > \\"The civilian labor force in Karachi dockyards had struck and stopped work. > No loading or unloading of ships was being done. In one case a ship went > back empty as it could not be loaded with cotton. Bhashani has been in > Karachi and elsewhere spreading disaffection. Expectations were that the > situation was likely to deteriorate\\".  Aftermath  On the 25th of March, Ayub Khan resigned as President of Pakistan and announced he was turning over the government of the nation to Army Chief of Staff Gen. Yahya Khan. Two days later, he highlighted reasons for his resignation in letter to General Yahya Khan in the following words; > I am left with no option but to step aside and leave it to the Defence > Forces of Pakistan, which today represent the only effective and legal > instrument, to take full control of the country. They are by the grace of > God in a position to retrieve the situation and to save the country from > utter chaos and total destruction. They alone can restore sanity and put the > country back on the road to progress in a civil and constitutional manner. The Police Service of Pakistan was unable to control the situation and the law and order situation began to worsen in the country, especially in the East where the serious uprising and riots were quelled in 1969. It became so serious that at one point, Home and Defence Minister Vice-Admiral Rahman told the journalists that the \\"country was under the mob rule and that police were not strong enough to tackle the situation.\\" In the 1970 Pakistani general election, the AL won 98 percent of the allotted national and provincial assembly seats in East Pakistan, whereas in West Pakistan, the PPP swept the polls in the region's two largest provinces, Punjab and Sindh. NAP performed well in the former NWFP and Balochistan. Most of the \\"status quo parties\\" (such as the many Muslim League factions) and most religious outfits (except Jamiat Ulema Islam) were decimated.

The Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK) is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed sociological presentations on social stratification. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the University of Cambridge and were often organised by the Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group). The seminars have also been held at the University of Cardiff (2003-5), the University of Edinburgh (2014, 2017), the University of Milan (2015), the University of Stirling (2007, 2011) and Utrecht University (2010).http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn, Professor Ken Prandy, and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this millennium the seminar has been organised by Professor Paul Lambert, who is Professor of Sociology at the University of Stirling and a longstanding fan of Stirling Albion F.C. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality. The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated. A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. Nature, 245(5426), p.415. This approach is the foundation of the CAMSIS Project which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries. A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled Social stratification:Trends and processesLambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013.

He published his debut novel, The Spirit Photographer, in 2018; it is set in the Reconstruction era in Boston, Massachusetts and in Louisiana plantation country.  Early life and education  Varese was born in Miami, Florida. He was first introduced to literature and the work of Charles Dickens at the age of 14 through the mother of a friend. He graduated from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in English Literature, and earned his Masters and Ph.D. in Literature from the University of California, Santa Cruz. His dissertation, The Value of Storytelling, examined the development of 19th-century serial novels in Great Britain, with a focus on the early novels of Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and George Eliot.  Career  = Fiction = Varese's debut novel, The Spirit Photographer (2018), is loosely based on the 19th-century American spirit photographer, William Mumler. Varese drew from his biography to create an independent novel about a protagonist who was a photographer in Boston after having worked with Matthew Brady during the Civil War to photograph the dead. One day he sees the face of an African-American woman he knew, who appears as a spirit in a glass-plate photograph of a couple seeking contact with their son who died young. The novel takes place during the Reconstruction era in U.S. history, exploring issues of northern and southern racism in post-Civil War America and the role of spiritualism in the widespread grief due to losses during the war. Varese has said that he was influenced in this novel by the work of civil rights activists Bryan Stevenson and Michelle Alexander, who have emphasized the connection between the slavery years and the history of the US since then. The Times Literary Supplement said there was not \\"a dud word in this extraordinary debut novel,\\" and compared Varese's writing to that of Wilkie Collins and Joseph Conrad.The Spirit Photographer, by Jon Michael Varese.

The Times Literary Supplement, September 14, 2018, p. 31.Booklist described the novel as \\"an addicting tale.\\" Chronogram Magazine wrote that it was an ambitious, sprawling debut, \\"teeming with spirits, secrets, and trauma.\\" PopMatters said that The Spirit Photographer was \\"atmospheric, lyrical, and poignant\\", and that it \\"deftly interweaves strands of history and fantasy.\\" The novel was praised by some academics. American Literature scholar Susan Gillman wrote that the novel unexpectedly brought \\"race and Southern Gothic to the world of Boston after the Civil War,\\" and that \\"ghosts of a different kind\\" haunted national memory in this \\"groundbreaking new historical novel.\\"The Spirit Photographer, book jacket blurb. American Civil War historian Bruce Levine called the novel \\"stunning,\\" writing that it combined \\"the thrills of mystery and fantasy with the feel of historical authenticity.\\"The Spirit Photographer, book jacket blurb. = Nonfiction and literary criticism = Varese‚Äôs nonfiction and literary criticism have focused on the work of Charles Dickens, particularly Dickens‚Äôs early novels and the publishing business that supported their development. Varese‚Äôs edition of Great Expectations was published in 2012 under the Signature imprint of Barnes and Noble publishers. Similarly, Varese has published numerous public humanities articles that recast topics in Victorian literature for general audiences, including a series of pieces that he wrote for The Guardian from 2009-2010. Varese was an original contributor to the Oxford Handbook of Charles Dickens. His chapter on Nicholas Nickleby examined the role of contracts and English contract law in relation to Dickens‚Äôs fiction during a time when concepts such as copyright, intellectual property, and royalty payments were being developed and debated in both professional and legal spheres. = Teaching and outreach work = Varese served as the Director of Digital Initiatives for The Dickens Project from 2010-2016. Earlier he had directed the development of the Our Mutual Friend Scholarly Pages (1998), a collaborative digital archive co-sponsored by The Dickens Project and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). The collaboration produced one of the first of a few digital archiving projects to be published on the Internet. It was revised for the bi-centenary of Dickens‚Äôs birth in 2012. In 2016, Varese was named Director of Public Outreach for The Dickens Project, a role he still occupies. He conducts liaison work between The Dickens Project and the University of Southern California‚Äôs Neighborhood Academic Initiative (NAI), USC‚Äôs primary outreach program to Title 1 schools in South Central Los Angeles.

First elected to the council in 2009, Lulung is a noted critic of Basuki Tjahaja Purnama's governorship. His business career was based around Tanah Abang, while his political affiliation was with the United Development Party until he moved to the National Mandate Party. Background Lulung was born in Jakarta on 24 July 1959 as the seventh of eleven siblings, with a mixed Betawi-Banten descent. His father Ibrahim Tjilang was a warrant officer in the Indonesian Army. A muslim from birth, he received his forename Abraham from a man in Papua who aided his father when the latter was injured there, in addition to his father's fascination with Abraham Lincoln. His father passed away in 1975, leading him to scavenge at Tanah Abang market. He would later continue his education at a trade school, graduating in 1981. Career =Business= At the age of 20, he became \\"the boss of scraps\\" following the expansion of a market, and participated in organizations related to Tanah Abang. By 1997, he was constructing small kiosks next to the walls of Tanah Abang's main buildings. Later on, he would own a law firm and various companies related to parking, security and debt collection. In an interview with Tempo, he referred to himself as \\"The Godfather, of the not-evil type\\". In 2005, after the murder of a gang leader, Lulung's companies would absorb many of the gang's members, which he said was to avoid the unassociated followers from causing trouble. =Politics= At some point, he had joined the United Development Party (PPP) but left when the party fractured, helping found the Reform Star Party and becoming one of its local chairs. By 2004, he had returned to his previous party, rising within the party's internal ranks to become the chair of the party's Jakarta branch. He was first elected into the Jakarta Council in 2009, and was appointed its deputy speaker. He was proposed as a possible running mate of Alex Noerdin in the 2012 gubernatorial election but did not run in the end. He was reelected in 2014, and retained his position as deputy speaker. Lulung often had disagreements with then- deputy governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama or Ahok, at one point suggesting that Ahok take a sanity test. Issues between the two before the latter became governor centered around the relocation of street merchants in Tanah Abang, When Joko Widodo resigned and Ahok became governor, the two once more clashed over the city's budgeting, particularly over an inflated item for uninterruptible power supplies. In another case, when Ahok was accused of inflating the price of land purchased by the city's government, Lulung stated that he wanted the Corruption Eradication Commission to designate Ahok as a suspect. However, when a movement rose in the city council to impeach Ahok, Lulung defended the governor. For the 2017 gubernatorial election, Ahok initially stated that he wanted to run as an independent candidate, to which Lulung declared that he would \\"slice his ear\\" if Ahok succeeded. Ahok eventually ran as a party-backed candidate, supported by Lulung's party PPP. Despite so, Lulung continued to oppose Ahok during the election. After Ahok lost the election as was imprisoned for blasphemy, he stated that he \\"had no personal issues\\" with the governor, but declined to visit him in prison, citing that a visit would be misinterpreted. During Anies Baswedan's governorship, Lulung has both supported and opposed the governor's move, defending a major reshuffle in the city government's high ranking officials while opposing the closure of Jalan M.H. Thamrin to motorcycle traffic, among others. He also proposed a law which would designate locations where drinking alcohol would be permitted in order to reduce deaths due to moonshine poisoning. In 2018, he decided to move to the National Mandate Party (PAN), citing his removal from the chairman of the Jakarta branch for his opposition against Ahok. He claimed that his move would swing 10 seats in favor of PAN. His term in the Jakarta Council automatically expired due to KPU regulations on 20 September 2018, when he was officially registered as a candidate for the People's Representative Council. He was elected as a member of the house for the 2019-2024 period.

Marshall was born in Fauquier County, Virginia. A grandson of Revolutionary War patriot Thomas Marshall, he was a cousin of Chief Justice John Marshall (many of whose sons likewise became lawyers). In 1827 A.J. Marshall married Maria Rose Taylor (1808-1844). Their children who survived to adulthood included Charles Marshall (1830 - 1902), Catherine Taylor Marshall (1832-1866) and Lily Marshall Green (1837-1919). After her death, Marshall remarried on November 5, 1845 to Ann E. Robb (1824-1907), and they had daughters Lucy (1855-after 1907) and Agnes Marshall Chew (1859-after 1907).1880 U.S. Federal Census for Baltimore (Independent City), Maryland No. 105findagrave.com no. 173290846 citing Baltimore Sun obituary of Feb. 21, 1907 p. 12, col.81850 U.S. Federal Census for Ashby's Fauquier County, Virginia, family 916 appears to show his occupation as a navigator and him living with his mother in law, Mrs. Robb. Career Alexander J. Marshall gave up his private legal practice in 1832 upon being elected Fauquier County clerk, one of three elected positions in every Virginia county. He was re-elected many times until leaving the office in 1846.Annie G. Day, Warrenton and Fauquier County Virginia (Fauquier Public Library 1970) (no page numbers) In December 1843, Mashall supported Martin Brooke, who made various charges against former delegate and later Fauquier County Circuit Judge John Scott, father of Fauquier's multi-term delegate Robert Eden Scott.testimony available at Library of Virginia, Executive correspondence 1843, box 16, folder5 From his home in Warrenton, Marshall also promoted the Rappahannock Canal which in the 1830s was planned to extend from Barnett's Mill in Culpeper County downstream to Fredericksburg, the first (or last) navigable port at the fall line of the Rappahannock River, which drains into the Potomac River and ultimately Chesapeake Bay. The canal into Virginia's Piedmont Region had been planned since circa 1811, and received further support when the United States Mine and other mining companies established gold, quartz and other mines near the Rappahannock and Rapidan Rivers in the 1830s.\\"Mineral Extraction: Gold\\" typescript p. 55 is p.11 of 12 and also marked with a handwritten \\"61\\" at the bottom<, available at https://www.fredericksburgva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1405 The canal consisted of a series of concrete and stone locks and gates enclosing ponds which bypassed the non-navigable sections of the Rappahannock river. Thus, the canal supplemented (and often ran nearly parallel to) the Rappahannock. Although parts of the project had begun at the Fredericksburg end by 1829, that had fallen into disrepair before further construction began in earnest in November 1847,RAppahannock NRIS Section 7, available at https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/VLR_to_transfer/PDFNoms/088-0137_Rapidan_Dam_Canal_of_the_Rappahannock_Navigation_1973_Final_Nomination.pdf The canal allowed farmers' produce from Fauquier, Culpeper and Rappahaannock Counties access to the markets in Fredericksburg (with ready links to Richmond, Washington D.C. and Baltimore, Maryland), as well as allowed imported or manufactured goods to travel upstream more cheaply than by wagon teams. Isham Keith and John Baker were prominent investors and the Virginia General Assembly granted a $100,000 loan to finish the canal in 1848. It officially opened in late November 1848, as three boats--the \\"A.J. Marshall\\", \\"Zachary Taylor\\" and \\"Lewis Cass\\"--arrived in Fredericksburg. On its first day of operations, the \\"Lewis Cass\\" returned with plaster to Kelly's Mill later in the day. This Marshall was its president by the 1850s. By the end of 1849, the Canal was complete through Fauquier County about 13 miles upstream of Warrenton, to Carter's RunNRIS section 7 p. 18 (or p. 18 of 46) and section 8 p. 29(p.29 of 46) mention both grist and saw mill ruins The canal would have 20 dams, most accompanied by one or more lift-locks (usually of stone and primarily designed to minimize flooding which could destroy the canal, although they also lifted or lowered boats). The canal's final length was about 50 miles; the locks' maximum boat width was 9 foot 9 inches.Frederick W. Franck, \\"The Rappahannock Canal\\" in Fauquier County, Virginia: 1759-1959 (Fauquier County Bicentennial Committee, Warrenton 1959) pp. 110-111 Two years later, money was sought to complete a tow path (previously boatmen on bateaux poled their craft through the ponds to the locks), but gross receipts had barely sufficed to keep the Canal navigable, even though no dividends had been paid to shareholders. When the Orange and Alexandria Railroad began operation, followed in 1852 by completion of his cousin Edward Carrington Marshall's Manassas Gap Railroad to The Plains in Fauquier County, both far undercut canal shipping prices. The canal business ended after about four years of operations with Alexander Marshall as its president, although Major Chancellor leased it 1855-57.Franck pp. 112-113 American Civil War Marshall's son, Charles Marshall, a lawyer who had moved to Baltimore, Maryland, returned to Virginia as the American Civil War began, in order to serve as an aide to General Robert E. Lee beginning in 1862. Late in the year, Marshall's cousin, James Keith Marshall, died. Alexander John Marshall assumed his seat in the Virginia Senate and represented Fauquier and Rappahannock Counties part-time til the war's end.Eugene M. Scheel, The Civil War in Fauquier, (Fauquier National Bank 1985) p. 73 His vote totals may have been boosted by distributing chapters of his Book for the Times with a fight-to-the-end theme.The Library of Virginia has five chapters of Marshall's book, which John Goode of Richmond published in 1863, although it is indexed and held as an unpublished manuscript in the special collections. Meanwhile, the canal became a strategic feature in various conflicts near Fredericksburg, including the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, and Captain John S. Mosby received considerable support from this area, including in 1864 recuperating from wounds near Carter's Run before his men evacuated him southward into Amherst County.Carter's Run NRIS p. 30 of 46 Death and legacy Marshall's grave in the Warrenton Cemetery After the war ended, the Rappahannock canal was sold in 1868 to Dr. W.S. Scott for $1500 after being publicly called a \\"venerable, and now valueless improvement\\".Franck Alexander Marshall moved to Baltimore, where he characterized himself on a census as a \\"retired merchant\\". He died in Baltimore on February 21, 1882, survived by his second wife, son and daughters. His remains were returned to Warrenton Cemetery and buried beside his first wife.findagrave no. 25124023 The Fredericksburg Water Power Company purchased the Rappahannock Canal's assets at some time after the Civil War, seeking to help bring water-powered industry to the city (like in Lowell, Massachusetts), but later the canal became one of the intakes for the city's drinking water filtration plant. The canal was briefly opened in 1901 to convey granite into Fredericksburg, and effectively drained in modern times, especially upon destruction of the Embry Dam in 2004, in order to restore the shad run (a major fishing resource of pre-European through early federalist times). Much of the former canal area in Fredericksburg is now a city park, with signage. The City of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County lobbied for its inclusion on the Virginia Landmarks Register, and it was placed upon the National Register of Historic Places in 1973, with the Carter's Run area achieving Rural Historic District status in 2014.

In 2016 it was replaced by the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. These acts form the basis and the mechanisms in NSW by which species, populations and ecological communities are declared endangered, vulnerable or critically endangered, and under which people and corporations are prosecuted for destruction of habitat sheltering such species, populations or communities. The Act was repealed by the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 (NSW). Species, populations, and ecological communities are declared endangered on advice from the NSW scientific committee (established by the act), which consists of 11 members appointed by the minister and whose purpose is to determine which species are to be listed as threatened species, which populations as endangered populations, and which ecological communities as endangered, critically endangered or vulnerable ecological communities. Additionally, the committee advises which processes should be listed as threatening processes, and advises the minister accordingly. Thus, under the Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, the Scientific Committee has declared various threatened species including, for example, the alpine she-oak skink (Cyclodomorphus praealtus) and the alpine tree frog (Litoria verreauxii alpina),Scientific Committee. 2016.

Retrieved 1 September 2018. A range of species recovery plans have been made in direct accordance with the TSC Act. Specific legal rulings have also been made in accordance with the Act. The purpose of the Act The purpose of the TSC Act was > (a) to conserve biological diversity and promote ecologically sustainable > development, and > (b) to prevent the extinction and promote the recovery of threatened > species, populations and ecological communities, and > (c) to protect the critical habitat of those threatened species, > populations and ecological communities that are endangered, and > (d) to eliminate or manage certain processes that threaten the survival or > evolutionary development of threatened species, populations and ecological > communities, and > (e) to ensure that the impact of any action affecting threatened species, > populations and ecological communities is properly assessed, and > (f) to encourage the conservation of threatened species, populations and > ecological communities by the adoption of measures involving co-operative > management. The Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016 lists many more purposes under the rubric of \\"ecologically sustainable development\\" while hoping for \\"biodiversity conservation in the context of a changing climate\\" It maintains the framework of a Scientific Committee for determining endangered species and communities. Some key concepts under the TSC Act In addition, the Act outlines * procedures for listing species, and ecological communities as threatened * requirements for species recovery plans and their implementation * requirements for threat abatement plans * species impact statements * biodiversity certification and requirements for \\"biobanking\\" * criminal acts under the TSC Act Cases under the Act Cases under the Act (both acts) are heard in the Land and Environment Court of New South Wales, and frequently concern contested development applications. See, for example, the judgment given in Vigor Master Pty Ltd v Hornsby Shire Council (2010) (NSWLEC 1297)Vigor Master Pty Ltd v Hornsby Shire Council (2010) (NSWLEC 1297) a case between a developer and a local council where remnants of \\"Blue Gum High Forest\\", a critically endangered ecological community under the TSC Act, occurred on 61% of the site proposed for development, and that for Mackenzie Architects International Pty Limited v Ku-ring-gai Council (2015) (NSWLEC 1353),Mackenzie Architects International Pty Limited v Ku-ring-gai Council (2015) NSWLEC 1353 also involving the Blue Gum High Forest community, while the case, David DeBattista v Shoalhaven City Council [2017] NSWLEC 1251,, concerned a threatened species, Melaleuca biconvexa, and a contested development application. In \\" Fife Capital Pty Ltd v Cumberland Council [2017] NSWLEC 1354 both proposed and preliminary work involving dam works and the endangered ecological community, \\"River-Flat Eucalypt Forest on Coastal Floodplains of the New South Wales North Coast\\", were contested. In Ingham Planning Pty Ltd v Ku-Ring-Gai Council [2010] NSWLEC 1222 the adequacy of a species impact statement concerning the critically endangered ecological community, Blue Gum High Forest, was contested. A case in 2003 in the Supreme Court of New South Wales appealed an earlier decision and the finding of the Scientific Committee, that \\"Kurri Sand Swamp Woodland\\" should be designated an endangered ecological community, with the appellant arguing that the committee's decision was invalid. The Land and Environment Court also hears cases involving offences under the TSC Act. Thus, in Chief Executive, Office of Environment and Heritage v Coffs Harbour Hardwoods Sales Pty Ltd [2012] NSWLEC 52, the defendant was found guilty of damaging vegetation under the act. The Land and Environment Court also makes orders under the Act, which may be appealed. Thus, in Warkworth Mining Limited v Bulga Milbrodale Progress Association Inc [2014] NSWCA 105, Warkworth mining appealed the decision of Preston CJ (15 April 2013) who had ruled against a proposed expansion of a coal mine which would have affected the \\"Warkworth Sands\\" endangered ecological community.

Samuel Patten is an American political consultant and lobbyist who received international attention in 2018 in relation to the Special Counsel investigation led by former FBI director Robert Mueller. In spring 2018, this was due to Patten's relationship with Konstantin Kilimnik, a subject of the investigation. In summer 2018, attention intensified due to Patten's emergence as a subject of the investigation in his own right, followed by his guilty plea, after being charged in August 2018 with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act for failing to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department when he represented the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party, from 2014 through 2018.  Early life and family  Patten's father is Bill Patten Jr., whose mother was the Washington, D.C., socialite Susan Mary Alsop; Patten Jr.'s father was later alleged to have been the British politician Duff Cooper, with whom his mother had an affair while married to her first husband Bill Patten. Patten Jr. moved to Maine, where he published a small-town weekly newspaper in Camden and became a prison minister. Patten grew up in Maine and went to school there. He graduated from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., in 1993. While at Georgetown he became close to his famous grandmother Susan Mary Alsop, and was once wounded while defending her from muggers. He married in 2013. He is a great-great-great- great-great-grandson of Peggy Schuyler and Stephen Van Rensselaer.  Career  Patten began his political career in Maine, as an intern for Senator William Cohen and as press secretary for Susan Collins during her campaigns for governor (1994) and senator (1996). In 1999 he moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked for Senators Collins and Olympia Snowe. He was the Maine campaign director for the George W. Bush presidential campaign in 2000. From 2001 to 2004 Patten headed the Moscow office of the International Republican Institute; while there he worked with Konstantin Kilimnik, who later moved to Kiev to work for Paul Manafort's consulting business in Ukraine. Patten worked for the U.S. State Department in 2008. In 2012, he advised Rob Sobhani on his U.S. Senate campaign in Maryland. In the mid-to-late 1990s, Patten did public affairs work for the Kazakhstan oil sector. Around 2012, he was being paid $30,000 per month by Bidzina Ivanishvili and a firm related to Ivanishvili. In 2014, Patten was receiving $20,000 per month from Iraqi deputy prime minister Saleh al-Mutlaq and the Al-Arabiya Coalition, to support al-Mutlaq's run for Prime Minister. In 2014, Patten was a senior consultant for SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, working at their Oregon office to help them fine-tune their models for the 2014 U.S. mid-term elections. He also helped SCL Group with their work on the 2015 Nigeria elections, including hiring Israeli hackers to find kompromat on presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari. Patten and Kilimnik founded Begemot Ventures International (BVI) in February 2015. Based in Washington, D.C., BVI is \\"a strategic and political advisory firm\\" that Patten claims only has clients outside the United States.  Guilty plea  Samuel Patten statement of the offense Samuel Patten plea agreement In August 2018, Patten was charged with violating the Foreign Agents Registration Act for failing to register as a foreign agent with the Justice Department when he represented the Opposition Bloc, a Ukrainian political party, from 2014 through 2018. In the statement of the offense, Kilimnik is identified as \\"Foreigner A\\", Begemot Ventures International as \\"Company A\\", and Serhiy Lyovochkin as \\"Foreigner B\\". The prosecution against Patten was an outgrowth of work by the Special Counsel investigation, which referred the matter to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and the Criminal Division of the Justice Department, which handled the prosecution.Rosalind S. Helderman & Spencer S. Hsu, American political consultant admits foreign money was funneled to Trump inaugural, Washington Post (September 1, 2018). Additionally, after Patten was interviewed by Senate Intelligence Committee staff, \\"the Committee made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice\\" because of \\"concerns about certain statements made by Mr. Patten.\\" In his subsequent guilty plea, Patten admitted to lying to the Intelligence Committee, although the crime to which Patten admitted guilt did not relate directly to his statements to the committee. As part of his guilty plea, Patten admitted that he laundered a $50,000 contribution from Kilimnik to the Trump inauguration committee, by having the money transferred from a Cypriot bank to his company and from there to an unnamed American who sent it to the committee. According to the charge, Patten knew that it was illegal for a foreign national to give money to the committee. He also admitted that he lied to a Congressional committee about the inauguration donation and about his foreign lobbying work, and that he intentionally destroyed documents about that work. On April 12, 2019, Patten was sentenced to three years' probation, 500 hours of community service and a $5000 fine.

The sites comprise the remnants of two convict-era watermills, the Brisbane Mill on the Williams Creek at Creekwood Reserve, Voyager Point and the Woronora Mill on the Woronora River at Barden Ridge. The original watermills were designed by John Lucas and built from 1822 to 1825 by assigned convict labour. The sites were added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2017.  History  =Early milling in New South Wales= In the first years of the colony of New South Wales, food production was problematic. The colonists relied on traditional European farming methods and crops which were not always suited to the Australian climate and conditions. While the production of wheat was restricted by climate, soil fertility and plant diseases, the conversion of grain to flour was largely influenced by issues of technology transfer. The adaptation of technology to a new physical and social environment was compounded by the restricted availability of skilled labour. Experienced millers and millwrights were in short supply in the early colony.Pearson 1996:56 The First Fleet had arrived with four millstones but with no millwrights nor suitable millstream a substantial milling enterprise was not possible. The first grain was ground with forty iron hand mills which quickly wore and had an output as little as one bushel per twenty four hours.Birmingham, Jack and Jeans 1983:27 As early as 1791 Governor Phillip noted that a windmill was urgently needed, although Lieutenant-Governor Philip Gidley King argued that the building of a mill would be too labour-intensive and expensive and stone querns presented a more practical option.Tratai 1994:14 Governor Phillip sent several requests for skilled tradesmen, to no avail. In 1793 a convict called Wilkinson eventually produced a treadmill. The treadmill garnered only one bushel per hour with two men walking the boards.Tratai 1994:19 - 22 Better treadmills followed with some still in use till 1825 for punishment. Horses and bullocks were also used to power mills such as that at Cox's estate at Winbourne and a mobile mill in the Hunter Valley, both operating in the 1830s.Birmingham, Jack and Jeans 1983:32 When Governor Hunter arrived in 1795 he brought designs and components for a windmill and by 1797 one had been erected at Millers Point in Sydney. Despite this one success the industry remained at a standstill. Mill technology was not easily acquired and implemented without the knowledge of experienced skilled tradesmen. Carpenters were also working with new timbers whose properties they were unfamiliar with. Various other problems including storms, theft, inexperienced operators and an economy drive by the British government further slowed the development of milling. A second windmill, at Parramatta, was eventually built in 1805, but by 1799 when Governor Hunter departed, the Sydney mill was the only operating unit and most milling was still being done by hand.Tatrai 1994:24-29 Meanwhile, both the first watermill and the first windmill in the colony had been built in 1794 on Norfolk Island under the direction of Lieutenant-Governor King. King was advantaged by the availability of more suitable timber and the use of Nathaniel Lucas, a convict who was an experienced carpenter with knowledge of millwrighting.Tratai 1994:19, 30 When King became Governor of New South Wales, he found that transfer of British mill technology to Sydney continued to be limited by the continuing lack of skilled tradesmen, and building materials and techniques, particularly suitable timber and strong mortar. The output of the one operational mill, at only six bushels per hour, could not meet the demand of the increased population and increased wheat production.Tatrai, pp30-31 King implemented regulation to control the quality and price of bread and moved to increase milling capacity. Under his direction Nathaniel Lucas prefabricated two post mills and quarried millstones on Norfolk Island. One was erected in 1797 at Miller's PointFarrer 2005:17 and was operated by the government. The other, erected in The Domain, was operated privately by Lucas and later Kable.Tatrai 1994:32 Government-owned mills began to be supplemented by private enterprises in this way. Nathaniel Lucas built several more mills which he operated privately and was followed into the milling and building trade by his son John. The development of water mills, specifically, was hampered by the Australian climate, characterised by variable rainfall and consequent variation in river flow. Early attempts at Parramatta in 1779 and 1803 failed due to intermittent water flows and dam collapse, poor sighting, bad construction and a continuing lack of skilled labour. Even after significant repairs the output was disappointing,Birmingham, Jack and Jeans 1983:38 and much grain was shipped down to Sydney for milling.Tatrai 1994:35 However, in the next 10 years, understanding of the local conditions improved, designs were adapted and skilled labour increased. The number of mills in the county of Cumberland began to decrease in the 1860s due to decreased grain production in the area and the opening up of new agricultural land. There was a massive spread of mills into expanding rural areas in the second half of the nineteenth century till the development of the rail system and cheaper transport costs along with more capital intensive technology encouraged the concentration of milling in capital cities in the early twentieth century. Steam power was developed in England at the end of the eighteenth century and was first implemented in Australian at Dickson's steam mill near Darling Harbour in 1815. Steam mills became common by the 1830s and became the dominant type of mill from the 1850s.Birmingham, Jack and Jeans 1983:45 From the late 1870s there was a gradual change to roller mills and increasing centralisation.Connah 1988:133 There were 11 mills in 1821, 46 by 1830, 100 by1840 and a peak of around 200 before the start of centralisation in the 1880s.Farrer 2005:18 =Nathaniel Lucas= Nathaniel Lucas, a builder, joiner and carpenter, was transported to Sydney as a convict in the First Fleet. Upon his arrival he was among fifteen convicts specially selected for their character and vocation to pioneer Norfolk Island, arriving on 6 March 1788.Herman 2006- 2012 He married one of the fifteen convicts, Olivia Gascoine, and the two had thirteen children between 1789 and 1807. Having proven his unmatched skill, Nathaniel was named master carpenter in 1795. In addition to supervising the construction of many of the island's buildings, he constructed an overshot mill on Norfolk Island in 1795. This was notable as the first successful mill of this type in the colony. The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser reported his return to Sydney on 17 March 1805 to take up the position of Superintendent of Carpenters in Sydney. With him on came two prefabricated, disassembled windmills and several mill stones fabricated on Norfolk Island.Ancestory.com 2006-2012 The two smock mills were erected; one above the Rocks and the other in what is now the Domain. The Sydney Gazette and NSW Advertiser on 16 February 1806 described Nathaniel Lucas erecting an octagonal smock mill near the Esplanade of Port Phillip, the present site of the Sydney Observatory. This mill had a height of 40 feet with a base diameter of 22 feet and worked 2 pairs of Norfolk Island mill stones. Nathaniel is credited with building six mills. He apprenticed at least one of his sons, John, in the building and millwright trades at his mills at Sydney and Liverpool from around 1805‚Äì1815. Nathaniel's success extended to various entrepreneurial pursuits. By 1809 he was building and selling boats. For his own uses he built a 60ton schooner, Olivia, in Port Dalrymple. The Olivia was key in the Lucas family goods-shipping enterprise until the late 1820s. Over time, the matriarch and a number of the Lucas children made either temporary or permanent moves to the Launceston area in Van Diemens Land. The family established a number of inter-related businesses, culminating in a regular trade between Van Diemens Land and Sydney Cove.Kate Matthew 2011 In 1818 Nathaniel gained the contract for building St Luke's Church, Liverpool, designed by architect Francis Greenway. The two had a tempestuous relationship. Greenway had previously quarrelled with Lucas over the building of the Rum Hospital and in 1818 alleged that poor quality stone was used the foundations of the church, and that Lucas was a drunkard. On 5 May 1818 Nathaniel Lucas' body was found in the Georges River at Liverpool, his death having \\"proceeded from his own act, owing to mental derangement\\".Herman 2006-2012 After Nathaniel's death The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser for Saturday 5 September 1818 advertised his wind mill in Liverpool for sale. =John Lucas= John Lucas had been born on Norfolk Island on 21 December 1796 to Nathaniel Lucas and his wife Olivia (n√©e Gascoigne). Both parents had arrived in the new colony as convicts on the First Fleet, and had married on Norfolk Island. He moved to Sydney with his family at the age of 9 and eventually followed in the footsteps of his father, apprenticing in carpentry and milling and pursuing various entrepreneurial ventures. In addition to building and operating three mills John is known to have owned an inn on George Street, Sydney, \\"The Black Swan\\", in addition to a warehouse and goods emporium at Liverpool. In 1817 John married Mary Rowley, the illegitimate daughter of wealthy land owner and Captain of the New South Wales Marine Corps, Thomas Rowley at St Philip's Church, Sydney. The marriage resulted in 10 children. Like many enterprising colonials, John's ventures were exposed to considerable risk. His substantial investment in his 1822 watermill on Harris Creek, known as the Brisbane Mill, in modern-day Voyager Point was hampered by a series of drought and flood. With an imperative to satisfy prominent creditors, Lucas attempted to supplement the Brisbane Mill with a new watermill, known as the Woronora Mill, in a remote area on the Woronora River near Engadine whilst he undertook significant repairs. The location of the two mills on tributaries of the Georges River may have allowed John to avoid paying duties on the flour he produced through shipping it in small boats to Liverpool, and using land transport to travel directly to the markets in Sydney, thereby avoiding the customs presence in Port Jackson.Jackson, Forbes, 2012 Ultimately, due to a combination of climactic events, the sinking of his family schooner, Olivia in 1827, the death of his brother and occasional business partner, William Lucas, and increasing competition from steam mills, John was declared bankrupt in 1828 and his two mills were transferred to his creditors. In time, he recovered from his financial problems, largely due to a substantial inheritance received by his wife in 1832. He became a prominent landholder in the Burwood district and in 1841 built the dam for the Australian Sugar Company sugar mill at Canterbury.SMH, Friday 2 February, 1883, p.5 He died in 1875 at Murrumbateman. John Lucas is remembered in the name of the suburb on the ridge above the Woronora Mill, known until recently as Lucas Heights. His name is also remembered in several place and street names at Richmond, Moorebank, Five Dock, Camperdown, Emu Plains, Panania, Lalor Park and Cronulla. John and Anne's eldest son, also named John Lucas, a builder and carpenter by trade, became a prominent Member of Parliament of New South Wales, serving part of his political career in Henry Parkes' Ministry. He was an advocate for free state schools, reformatories for wayward children, trade protection, and many other causes. He was one of the first to visit Jenolan Caves in 1861 and worked to have the area protected as a reserve and opened to the public. One of the largest caverns was named after him, and names such as Lucas Heights, various roads and other areas around NSW are sometimes attributed to him, or John Lucas Snr.Helen Lucas, 2011 =Establishment of the Brisbane Mill= John Lucas built this first flour mill on Harris Creek (now known as Williams Creek) at Holsworthy in 1822. Whilst his 150-acre grant extended from the eastern bank of the creek, he chose to construct the mill on the western bank, which formed part of his father-in-law's adjacent grant of 700 acres, because it was better suited to the purpose. It was named the Brisbane Mill for Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane who had granted the land to John. The fairly remote location was referred to as Liverpool, in reference to the nearest township. The area was difficult to access overland as there was no bridge across the Georges River to this southern settlement until the building of the Liverpool Weir in 1836. Despite this, the flat and fertile area known today as Holsworthy was becoming recognised by remote farmers for its agricultural potential, and Mary and John joined early European settlers including their neighbour, Mary's brother, Thomas Rowley Jnr in the area. At the time of the 1828 Census John and Mary were recorded to be living at the Brisbane Mill with five of their children and nine assigned convicts.Curbie 2004 In addition to the mill and its associated buildings and infrastructure, various domestic buildings, crops and livestock would have been necessary at this remote location to support such a household. Beyond milling, John and Mary identified other commercial opportunities at the site. An advertisement in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser on Thursday 1 April 1824, p4, two years after the mill was built in 1824 the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, advertised both the milling function of the site and its use as a goods emporium: > 'BRISBANE WATER MILL,- The first Grant of His Excellency the present > Governor of One Hundred and Fifty Acres of Land, for the Purpose of erecting > a Water Mill, at Liverpool, has been completed by Mr, John Lucas, a native > of the Colony.

Orders punctually attended to; and as cheap > supplied at my shop. No. 72 George-street, Sydney. S. Levey. N.B. - Good > Bread for Sale, at the Brisbane Warehouse.'.The Sydney Gazette and New South > Wales Advertiser on Thursday 1 April 1824, p4 The advertisement is listed by a Mr S. Levey. Solomon Levey was a prominent emancipist, philanthropist and merchant. With his partner Daniel Cooper he owned the Waterloo Warehouse, a very large 5 storey building located at 72 George Street Sydney. Amongst their significant portfolio of businesses and assets they had interests in numerous other mills in the Sydney area. The fact that Levey is the author of the advertisement suggests that he had a financial interest in the Brisbane Mill. It is possible that John Lucas had approached Levey for investment to adapt the mill and dam following the drought referenced in the article. In 1827 John sought to further diversify his business interests, advertising an additional business functioning at the site, The Brisbane Distillery.(The Australian, 27 July 1827, p. 2) In addition to the drought John faced other significant financial pressures. The NSW Colonial Secretaries Index for 1824 reveals that had been unable to pay for his mill stones for the Brisbane Mill upon its construction in 1822, promising instead to pay in flour from his mill. At this time he was also on the list of defaulters in payment for assigned convict tradesmen. John Lucas' venture was also threatened by the unpredictable volatility of the price of wheat. A survey published in the Colonial Times in Hobart in 1831 gives the average monthly prices of wheat paid in Sydney in 1828. With variation between a minimum of 8 shilling 9 pence in January to 15 shillings in July per bushel, forecasting of profits would have been extremely difficult. When a significant flood destroyed his newly adapted mill and dam late in 1824 Lucas sought a second milling site in an attempt to supplement his losses, perhaps temporarily. =Establishment of the Woronora Mill= John Lucas built his second mill on the Woronora River in 1825. As at the Brisbane Mill, John chose not to build this mill on his own 150 acre grant on the north western side of the river but instead built on crown land on the more suitable southern bank. In this extremely remote river valley there would have been no adverse consequences for this decision. At this time there were no substantial European settlements in the area. In light of this isolation it is said that prior to the 1830s Botany Bay, Broken Bay and their associated river systems were \\"havens for smugglers\\".Curby 2004: 13 Some historians have speculated that Lucas may have chosen the location precisely to exploit its isolation, conducting illicit business such as smuggling illicit alcohol from the Five Islands district, using the mill as a legitimate front. The mill wheel and machinery would most probably have been made off site, disassembled and transported by boat to the mill site. Sydney's foundries were capable of producing castings such as wheel frames and gears up to 4 tons by 1823 but it is known that mill parts were also imported.Pearson 1996:57 Getting these large items and the mill stones weighing approximately a ton each from boats to the site would have required a substantial labour force. Once constructed, a small work force would be required to operate the mill. Some clearing of the woodland was undertaken on the southern riverbank to allow for modest accommodation to be constructed and perhaps also limited livestock and cultivation of crops. =Bankruptcy= On Monday 8 September 1828 The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser summoned John Lucas and all his creditors to a hearing of the Supreme Court of New South Wales to examine his bankruptcy. On Wednesday 17 September 1828 John Lucas was declared bankrupt in The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser with trustees appointed to deal with his estate. On Monday 5 November 1832 the Sydney Morning Herald, documented the transfer of both of John Lucas' mills and associated land to Solomon Levey. Levey's connection to John Lucas is unclear, as are the terms under which the mills became his property. Under new ownership the Brisbane Mill appears to have continued functioning in some capacity. Upon Levey's death in 1833 it officially passed to his business partner Daniel Cooper. On Monday 2 December 1839 The Sydney Monitor and Commercial Advertiser declared the sale of flour, bran and pollard at Coopers Brisbane Mill in any quantity. It would seem that the mill buildings were utilised during this period as an emporium with the produce more likely to have been processed by Cooper's steam mills in Sydney. Little is known of the Brisbane Mill site until the 1860s when Joseph Pemmell was operating a paper and cardboard mill nearby. This was converted into a flour mill and, later a woolwash, run by Thomas Woodward before being destroyed by fire in the 1880s.(Liverpool City Council) The four mills built successively on this site demonstrate the evolution of mill technology into the twentieth century and its application to different industries, giving a history of industrial and technological change through the nineteenth century. There is no mention of the Woronora Mill ever operating again. An advertisement dated Tuesday 14 March, 1843 describes the Woronora Mill as \\"being burnt down some years ago\\". On 18 May 1843 Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, then Surveyor General of New South Wales, wrote to the governor describing the \\"direct line of road to the Illawarra\\" that he had surveyed and was being built. The letter states, \\"It will be obvious from the accompanying map that the River Woronora which is navigable for boats to Lucas' Mill Dam'. The remote riverside location later attracted squatters who erected huts around the Woronora site into the mid twentieth century. These were converted into weekenders in the 1960s, but were later wiped out by bushfires. The local council, noting the hazardous environment demolished all structures and have maintained the site as a river reserve into the present. =The Dharawal= The Dharawal people are the traditional custodians of the land extending from Botany Bay to the Shoalhaven River and Nowra and inland to Camden. For millennia, natural resources supplied all their material needs. The land around the Georges River and its tributaries provided water, food and shelter. The streams and swamplands offered a variety of food. The forest lands sheltered possums, lizards, kangaroos and wallabies and there were roots, berries and seeds to gather. Birds also provided meat and eggs. Along the Georges River, sandstone eroded, forming rock overhangs which provided shelter. The walls of these shelters were often decorated with images and hand stencils outlined in red ochre, white clay or charcoal. Evidence of their tracks, camps and significant sites are scattered across the region, and continue to have meaning for the Dharawal people today. As the colonial settlement expanded into Dharawal country there was notable conflict. In spite of this, some Europeans formed ties with the local Aboriginal community. Figures such as Charles Throsby were persistent critics of European treatment of local Aboriginal people. Others, such as Hamilton Hume and John Hume recognised that the Aboriginal community's knowledge of the land made them resourceful companions in a new and foreign environment (Campbelltown City Council). The Holsworthy area is also noted to be of traditional significance to the Dharug and the Gandangara. There is no record of John Lucas' interaction with Aboriginal peoples, though it would have been considerable.  Description  Lucas Watermills are located across two separate archaeological sites. These sites, located in south west Sydney, comprise the remains of the Brisbane Mill, and the Woronora Mill together with associated infrastructure including dams, flour-processing machinery and accommodation. = The Brisbane Mill = Brisbane mill site The site is in a swampy tidal area on Williams Creek. The surrounding vegetation consists of woodland with casuarinas and mangroves. There is a trail that provides public access from Creekwood Reserve. A large number of tracks run through the site on the southern bank of the river. The river is navigable for small boats to approximately 10m below the dam site. A series of axe grinding groves at the northern extent of the site demonstrates the use of the site by the Dharawal Aboriginal people. There is a mixture of industrial remains on the site. A substantial rock cut channel and other rock work exhibit pick marks indicating construction in the early nineteenth century. The remains of two rock and concrete dams are visible on the southern edge of the site. The visible remains suggest that the mill was located on the western bank of the creek. There are 4 types of visible features: # Cuts in the bedrock, made with rock picks. These are the most common type of feature. # Holes drilled into the rock, all of approximately 50mm diameter. # Stone and cement dam walls. The type of cement and stone indicates that some of the walling is related to Lucas' 1825 mill, other walling relates to the later paper and woollen mills which operated on site in the latter nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. # A 12000mm long, 1000mm wide trench cut through rock, which is likely to have been the mill race. = The Woronora Mill = Woronora mill site The site is on the Woronora River in a steep valley of rocky, open woodland. It can be accessed on food via a fire trail upstream at the Pass of Sabugal. A large Water Board supply pipe from Woronora Dam runs above the site on the southern bank of the river. The river is navigable for small boats to approximately 60m west of the site. The visible remains suggest that the mill was located on a relatively level shelf of bedrock on the north eastern bank of the river. There are 3 types of visible features: # Cuts in the bedrock, made with rock picks. The largest of these cuttings could support a timber beam up to 450mm wide, a suitable support for a bearing of the water wheel. # Holes drilled into the rock, all of approximately 50mm diameter. # Remnant cement which can be used to trace the line of the mill dam. = Condition = Materials at the site of the Brisbane Mill are likely to have been reused or scrapped by successive occupants up to the 1920s. Fires and floods since the abandonment of the Woronora Mill have removed most of its structure however archaeological remains may include evidence of structures that controlled water flow, the waterwheel, mill machinery, ancillary buildings and associated infrastructure.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries for the Brisbane Mill The Lucas Watermills Archaeological Sites, built by the prominent colonial miller, John Lucas, are of historical significance as two of the earliest surviving watermill sites in the state. Their association with the builder's father, the First Fleet Convict, Nathaniel Lucas, who built 6 of the first mills in the colony, is of state significance. They were constructed with convict labour and, together, show Lucas' attempts to continuously adapt his milling strategy in the face of environmental challenges. The adaptation of technology across the two sites, and Lucas' ultimate failure to make this milling venture economically viable demonstrates the difficulty of food production, in particular the conversion of grain to flour in the new colony. They demonstrate the early development of the milling industry as well as the transport networks that supplied the mills, distributed their products and integrated their operations. The story of Lucas' watermills is also of state significance for its ability to communicate the entrepreneurial aspirations of 1820s New South Wales colonials. Heritage boundaries for the Woronora Mill The Lucas Watermills Archaeological Sites were listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 30 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Lucas' Mills are of historical significance as two of the earliest surviving industrial archaeological sites in the state. While altered, the immediate sites continue to reflect the remote character of the places as they were when the mills were first constructed; The mills and the machinery are of significance as they were constructed and operated with the use of convict labour; The sites reflect how, in the 1820s, early colonial entrepreneurs used the fertile lands along the waterways of the Georges River for transport and commerce, closely connecting the area with Liverpool, Botany Bay and Sydney; The locations chosen by Lucas on tributaries of the Georges River are of state significance for telling the story of early attempts by the government to impose tariff policies on flour production and the way in which the industry adapted in response; The adaptation of machinery and facilities across the two sites (including a second dam and conversion of undershot to overshot milling at Brisbane Mill), and Lucas' ultimate failure to make his milling venture economically viable demonstrate the difficulty of food production, in particular the conversion of grain to flour in the new colony. Across Australia there were issues in adapting technology to a new physical and social environment and in implementing the technology with limited skilled labour. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The mills are associated with their builder, the prominent miller John Lucas and through him his father Nathanial Lucas; Nathaniel Lucas (1764‚Äì1818) was a convict transported to Australia on the First Fleet. He was appointed Master Carpenter at Norfolk Island in 1802 and later, Superintendent of Carpenters in Sydney. He built six of the first successful mills in the colony including the 1797 mill at Millers Point, and major building projects such as the Greenway designed Rum Hospital (1811) and St Luke's Anglican Church, Liverpool (1818). He trained his sons in his trade; The sites are also associated with their later owners, Solomon Levey and Daniel Cooper, who were highly successful entrepreneurs in the early colony and made several ventures in the milling industry, notably running one of the earliest steam mills; The Brisbane Mill was named for Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane (1773‚Äì1860), who granted the land to Lucas. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The two mills and the connecting waterways allow for examination of the cultural maritime landscape of the 1820s; They demonstrate the early development of the milling industry as well as the transport networks that supplied the mills, distributed their products and integrated their operations; Visible surface remains of the mills include cuts in the bedrock made with rock picks, holes drilled into the rock and stone and cement dam walls and channels. These indicate the locations and functions of the mill dams, wheel pits, races, sluices and other structural rock, which, together, demonstrate the evolving understanding of water utilisation along these particular bodies of water. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological resource may include structures that controlled water flow, mill machinery, buildings for processing and storage and associated infrastructure including domestic dwellings; The sites and their interrelationships provide a unique opportunity to understand the industrial development of milling and food production more broadly in the early colony; The continuation of use of the Brisbane Mill site for the paper and woollen industries (s-1920s), with new dams and a steam mill demonstrate the evolution of milling technology over a century. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Remnants of other water driven flour mills exist elsewhere in the state, however these are some of the earliest and are the only substantial remains in the Sydney metropolitan area, having been relatively undisturbed. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Lucas' sites and their evolution provide good representative examples of early milling infrastructure in NSW which required much experimentation to meet local environmental and logistical constraints and were largely ultimately unsuccessful.

The series stars Julia Montes as Ana Dimasalang, a victim of Salvador del Mundo who is fighting back against him along with her sister, Samantha, and her close friends and family. The show features an ensemble cast consisting of Shaina Magdayao, Aljur Abrenica, Lorna Tolentino, Agot Isidro, Nonie Buencamino, Louise delos Reyes, and Desiree del Valle.  Plot  The second season begins with the aftermath of Gael's (Paulo Avelino) death and the impact of it on Ana (Julia Montes). Despite his son's death, Salvador Del Mundo (Nonie Buencamino) continues his political ambition, he runs for governor in the province of San Ildefonso. The relationship between Ana and her in-laws becomes more adversarial, especially after she inherits Gael's fortune. Fearing their ruthlessness, Ana decides to hide the truth about her pregnancy from Salvador and Miranda (Lorna Tolentino). Upon learning of Gael's demise, Miranda's sister, Natasha (Desiree del Valle) and her son, Gavin (Charles Kieron) return to the country. Ana begins to suspect that Miranda and Salvador are behind Gael's death. Hoping to put a stop to Salvador's crimes, Hillary (Agot Isidro), Salvador's wife, decides to run for Mayor. Hillary wins as mayor and Salvador wins the gubernatorial seat. Meanwhile, Miranda and Hillary's conflicts escalate since both Salvador and Hillary find themselves working together. While Hillary refuses to have anything to do with him, Salvador secretly plans to win her back and instructs his lawyer to drop his petition for annulment. Already unable to forgive herself for her role in the botched assassination attempt on kill Ana and Samantha, her relationship with Salvador suffers as she blames Salvador for their son's murder. Her discovery of his plan to win back Hillary further destroys her trust and loyalty for the man she loved and protected all her life. Miranda's world is further complicated with the arrival of her sister, Natasha, who is on the run from loan sharks in Las Vegas. Natasha hopes to receive the protection and gain the good graces of her powerful sister and brother-in-law. She is unable to tell Miranda the truth, but Salvador finds out and uses the information to coerce Natasha to spy on Miranda, since he started having suspicions of Miranda's loyalty. Not fully understanding the depth of Salvador's malevolence, Natasha undermines Miranda's plans to free herself from Salvador, convincing herself that Ana has poisoned Miranda's mind. Meanwhile, Miranda suspects that Ana is pregnant and decides to kidnap Ana to find out the truth. Grieving over her son, she feels hopeful for a relationship with her grandchild. As Miranda's captive, both Miranda and Ana find common ground in their love for Gael and their unborn child. As time passes, Miranda regrets her previous participation with Salvador and vows to help Ana bring him down. When Salvador discovers Miranda's involvement in Ana's abduction, including her plans to bring him down, he kills Miranda by ramming her with his SUV, driving at high speed. He gets rid of the evidence that Miranda handed to Ana, and hires his men to cover his tracks and claim false witness on the circumstances of her death. Salvador manages to convince Natasha that he had no hand in her sister's murder. But Miranda had carefully planned all her moves, anticipating Salvador's reaction to her treachery. She leaves her cellphone at Hillary's house, containing her confession video, admitting to her crimes and Salvador's full participation and mastermind of all the murders, illegal firearms dealing and criminal activities. She also leaves instructions with her lawyer to execute if she was killed. The lawyer is instructed to contact Ana. Armed with Miranda's full confession and the documents left with her lawyer as evidence, Ana and Miranda's lawyer, together with Hillary and the police go to Salvador's house to arrest him. The video confession is released to the media and drives the public against Salvador. True to form, Salvador escapes prison before his trial but quickly loses all his political allies who previously protected him. He coerces his sister-in- law Natasha to hide him, who, at the same time, is desperate to pay her debt to the Las Vegas loan shark who is threatening to kill her son. Fortunately, Ana's camp suspect Natasha and follow her. They entrap Natasha and Salvador, feeding them false information that Ana has gone into premature labor. The information flushes Salvador from his hiding place, and the authorities catch him again but this time, Salvador's only option to escape a prison sentence is to plead insanity. He exhibits his mental instability at his trial. His antics do not convince the court appointed psychiatrist. In addition, Yvonne finds the auto repair shop that fixed the blood smeared car light. The automotive repair shop's CCTV camera records Salvador leaving the white SUV with the bloody bumper and lights. The trial completes and the Judge rules down a guilty verdict and life imprisonment. While Salvador is in prison, he is mistreated by his fellow inmates, but this does not keep him from planning a jail outbreak. He bides his time until Ana delivers her son and then uses his prison allies to escape and kidnap his grandson and coerces Natasha to hide his grandchild as he prepares to exit the country. He takes Samantha as hostage to further strengthen his bargaining advantage against Ana and Hillary. While Ana and the authorities conduct a manhunt for Salvador, Samantha and Ana's baby, Salvador successfully gets Hillary in a swap hostage situation. Hillary unwillingly joins Salvador in exchange for Samantha's life. But time is running out for Salvador. While Natasha hurries to bring Ana's child to Salvador at the docks, Gavin catches and confronts her. Although Gavin is not able to convince her to do the right thing, he reports his mother to the authorities. By this time, Natasha's conscience bothers her so she directs Ana to the docks where Salvador boards with his captives. In a final and bloody fight, Ana shoots him as he falls to his death. Natasha is apprehended by the authorities. The last scene is Samantha's and Xander's wedding where everyone appears to be enjoying a peaceful life at last. Ana had said earlier that she would open a small business of mobile clinic services with the funds she inherited from Gael. She will set up a trust fund for her son from Miranda's inheritance. Hillary succeeded in retrieving the millions of cash and assets stolen from her by Salvador and Miranda. She is funding Samantha's new jewelry business. The sisters, Hillary, Tantan, Yvonne, and Xander are whole again.

It involves moving the bell in a pendulum motion from between the knees to anywhere between eye level to fully overhead and can be performed either two-handed or using one hand. There are three versions of kettlebell swing: Russian Swing, American Swing and Sport Style Swing.  Overview  Kettlebell swing - Hinge-based style The kettlebell is swung from just below the groin to somewhere between the upper abdomen and shoulders, with arms straight or slightly bent, the degree of flexion depends on the trajectory of the kettlebell. The key to a good kettlebell swing is effectively thrusting the hips, not bending too much at the knees and sending the weight forwards, as opposed to squatting the weight up, or lifting up with the arms. This requires an intense contraction of the gluteal, abdominal and latissimus muscles. The swing can also be performed with a release and catch of the kettlebell, which helps train the proper swing pattern where the arms aren't pulling up at the top. This can be done with two hands switching to a supinated catch. The one-arm swing presents a significant anti-twisting challenge, and can be used with an alternating catch switching between arms. Further variations include the walking swing taking a step forward at the apex of each swing, the outside swing where the kettlebell swings outside the leg, and the kneeling swing, swinging between the legs in a one-leg half-kneeling position. There is controversy within the kettlebell world about whether a swing can only be performed with a hip hinge, and not with a squat. Within the kettlebell sport world, employing knee flexion during the swing is more common.  Types and variations  There are two types of kettlebell swings: * Hardstyle kettlebell swing (Hinge-based) ‚Äì a hinge pattern which primarily utilizes the muscles of the posterior chain (hamstrings and glutes). It should be practised with a good ground connection for stability and power production; a flat sole shoe or barefoot is preferred when performing swings. * Kettlebell sport swing (Pendulum-based) ‚Äì the motion of the kettlebell sport swing is double knee bend compared to the focused hip hinging motion of the hardstyle swing. This allows for stretch reflex from hamstrings to help scoop the bell up, ensures upward trajectory. There are many variations of the kettlebell swing, some are, but not limited to: * single arm swing * one kettlebell double arm swing * two kettlebells double arm swing * suitcase swing * swing squat style * high swing Within those variations there are plenty more variations, some are, but not limited to: * pace * movement * speed * power * grip * direction of thumb * elbow flexion * knee flexion  Benefits  Kettlebell swing benefits include: * Increased Power * Increased Muscular Endurance * Increased Aerobic Capacity * Increased Anaerobic Capacity  References  Exercise physiology ","title":"Kettlebell swing"},{"id":"58355871","text":"Vladimir Arkadyevich Petukhov (; December 16, 1949 ‚Äî June 26, 1998) was mayor of Nefteyugansk in 1996-1998.

It was located north of Charlottesville near what is now the Ivy Creek Reservoir. It was built on the site of the Union Ridge Graded School (founded 1885) after that building burned down in 1893. The school served all grades, and is notable for being the first four-year high school for African American students in Albemarle County. In 1951, its students were transferred to the new Burley High School in Charlottesville, and the facility became an elementary school until closing in 1959.  Curriculum and student body  The school's curriculum changed significantly over time, beginning with practical training in trades and eventually shifting to a more academically oriented high-school curriculum. In 1918, the school planned to open a broom factory in Charlottesville, operating as a satellite program of the school. In 1941, a course in woodworking, taught by W. W. Coles, was added to the curriculum as part of the county's effort to add national defense training courses to the school district. The school's student body shifted with the demographics of Albemarle County. During the era in which the school operated, the African American population decreased, but a higher percentage of remaining African American children entered high school classrooms. In 1941, a school in Oak Union closed and its prospective students enrolled at the Albemarle Training School.  Administration  The school was led by African American principals and teachers, as was generally the case in segregated schools in the region. The school's first principal was Jesse Scott Sammons (1853-1901). A descendant of the Hemings family of Monticello, he grew up in the free Black community of Union Ridge and had been the first teacher at the one-room Ivy Creek school, and the first principal of the Union Ridge Graded School. John G. Shelton served as Principal in the 1910s; he was also editor of the Charlottesville Messenger, the city's Black newspaper at the time. Mary Carr Greer served as the school's principal from 1931 to 1949, after teaching Domestic Science there for fifteen years. She worked to develop an accredited 4-year curriculum similar to that in white high schools of the period.

He was certainly the best rider and the best shot, and always graceful in everything he did. He had a quick smile and a gentle manner, but I already suspected that he could be both reckless and ruthless, and I was not surprised when within two years he had become one of the most daring outlaws on the Trucial Coast with half a dozen blood-feuds on his hands' (1960: 208‚Äì9).

The channel focuses on higher mathematics with a distinct visual perspective. Topics covered include linear algebra, calculus, neural networks, the Riemann hypothesis, Fourier transform, quaternions and topology. As of October 2020, the channel has 3.14 million subscribers. History Sanderson graduated from Stanford University in 2015 with a bachelor's degree in math. He worked for Khan Academy from 2015 to 2016 as part of their content fellowship program, producing videos and articles about multivariable calculus, after which he started focusing his full attention on 3Blue1Brown. 3Blue1Brown started as a personal programming project in early 2015. In a podcast of Showmakers, Sanderson explained that he wanted to practice his coding skills and decided to make a graphics library in Python, which eventually became the open-source project \\"Manim\\" (short for mathematical animations). To have a goal for the project, he decided to create a video with the library and uploaded it to YouTube. On March 4, 2015, he uploaded his first video. He started to publish more videos and improve the graphics tool. Videos 3Blue1Brown videos are themed around visualizing math, including pure math such as number theory and topology as well as more applied topics in computer science and physics. The visuals are predominantly generated by Manim, a Python animation library written by Sanderson, though occasionally visuals are drawn from other software such as macOS's Grapher application. The channel includes several series on topics including linear algebra, calculus, differential equations, and neural networks. During the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the channel also featured a series of live-streamed lectures under the name \\"Lockdown Math\\" aimed at students learning from home. The channel has collaborated with several other educational YouTube channels, including videos with MinutePhysics on quantum physics and orbital motion. as well as projects with Numberphile, Smarter Every Day, Physics Girl, and Stand-up Maths. The channel's videos have been featured in Popular Mechanics, ABC News, and Quanta Magazine. Sanderson appeared on podcasts such as the Numberphile Podcast, Lex Fridman, the Art of Problem Solving's AfterMath podcast, Siraj Raval, and Showmakers. Sanderson briefly hosted his own podcast called \\"Ben, Ben and Blue\\" with Ben Stenhaug and YouTuber Ben Eater. Talks In August 2019, Sanderson delivered a keynote titled Concrete before Abstract at ODSC India. The talk outlines a principle he attempts to follow to make mathematics accessible. In January 2020, Sanderson delivered a talk in An Evening with Grant Sanderson, hosted by the Stanford Speakers Bureau. Sanderson offered his perspective on engaging with math: instead of prioritizing usefulness, he emphasizes emotion, wonder and imagination. He aims to ‚Äúbring life to math‚Äù with visuals, graphics, and animations. > ‚ÄúWhen people engage with fiction, no one ever asks, ‚ÄòWhen am I going to use > this?‚Äô [...] The same thing fiction can do for people, so can math.

It was released in Japan in 2008, and in both North America and Europe in 2009. As a remake of the 1997 PlayStation game Klonoa: Door to Phantomile, it follows the titular character and his friend Huepow in their efforts to save the dreamworld of Phantomile from the evil spirit Ghadius, who plots to turn it into a world of nightmares. Gameplay takes place within a 2.5D perspective, featuring 2D gameplay with 3D graphics. It is the eighth and final game in the Klonoa series. Development of the game began after Shin Unozawa, the vice president of Namco Bandai Games, expressed interest in reviving the series. In acknowledgement of the series' impending 10-year anniversary, Namco Bandai decided that a remake of the original would be the best approach. The game was produced by Hideo Yoshizawa, the director of the original Door to Phantomile, alongside other former members of the Klonoa Works division. The team chose the Wii as the platform to develop it for due to its wide appeal. Care was taken into making the game easier to control and more intuitive, such as altered level designs, the speed at which Klonoa runs, and his attack range. For the North American version, Namco Bandai proposed a redesign for the character to make him look less \\"old- fashioned\\" and appealing for Western audiences, a design that was met with a significant negative backlash and swiftly scrapped. Klonoa was well-received by critics, who commended its gameplay, controls and art direction, although some felt that it was too easy and lacked any major enhancements over the original game. Multiple critics have placed it among the Wii's best exclusive titles, with Nintendo Power voting it to be one of the best games released on a Nintendo console. Despite its acclaim, it was a commercial failure, resulting in Bandai Namco unwilling to continue with the series, who promptly scrapped the idea of a remake of the second game and a potential third installment. Gameplay Klonoa carrying an inflated enemy in the game's first level. Klonoa is a side-scrolling platform video game, serving as a remake of Klonoa: Door to Phantomile. The player controls the protagonist Klonoa through each of the game's stages; these are presented in a 2.5D perspective, with gameplay itself taking place within a 2D plane. Klonoa can use a large ring called the \\"Wind Bullet\\" to grab enemies, who become inflated and can be used as either a projectile weapon or as an extra jump boost tor each higher places. Inflated enemies can also be thrown into either the foreground or the background. Some stages end with a boss, which take place within either 2D planes or large, circular 3D arenas. The remake contains several features not present in the original. The player can access \\"flipped\\" versions of each stage, which mirrors the game horizontally and gives Klonoa six extra hit points instead of three; these flipped stages host a secret, harder version of them that can be found through exploration. The player can also unlock several costumes for Klonoa. By using the Wii Remote the player can use a special spin-attack to defeat enemies, as well as being able to change the voices into English instead of the default \\"gibberish\\" language. Development In 2005, Namco merged with Bandai to form Bandai Namco Holdings, the third-largest video game entity in Japan. Shin Unozawa, the vice president of Namco Bandai Games, expressed interest in reviving the Klonoa series due to its large, enthusiastic fan community. In acknowledgement of the series' impending 10-year anniversary, Namco Bandai decided that a remake of the original would be the best approach, and would help determine if the series would be suitable for a proper revival if it was successful. The Wii was chosen as the platform to develop it for as the company felt it had a wide appeal, which it felt fulfilled the original's premise of appealing to both younger and older players. Klonoa's character redesign (left) and Klonoa's proposed North American redesign (right) The game itself was developed by Japanese studio Paon. Leading production was producer Hideo Yoshizawa, the director of the original Door to Phantomile; assisting him were members of the former Klonoa Works development studio, including chief planner Tsuyoshi Kobayashi, Yoshihiko Arai, and sound designer Kanako Kakino. Yoshizawa also recruited fans of the series within the company to work on the game. The hardware capabilities of the Wii allowed Yoshizawa and the development staff to make Klonoa world closer to their original idea when they were working on the PlayStation original, namely the addition of transparent water, shadows from trees, and sunlight. Many other additions were made to the gameplay to make more intuitive and easier to control, such as the speed at which Klonoa runs, the length of his attack, modified enemy hitboxes and the addition of a spin attack. The levels were also slightly altered to make them more \\"playful\\", such as different enemy placements and less-rounded level geometry. The addition of the flipped levels and unlockable costumes were designed to appeal to hardcore fans of the genre. The game was also given proper voice acting; the Japanese version features Kumiko Watanabe as Klonoa, Akemi Kanda as Huepow, Yuko Minaguchi as Lephise, and Bin Shimada as Joka. The in-game cutscenes were remastered with cel-shaded animation, an idea borrowed from Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil. Klonoa was unveiled at the 2008 Tokyo Game Show, and released in Japan on December 4. On January 9, 2009, Namco Bandai Games announced that the game would see an international release. For the North American version, Namco Bandai proposed a redesign of Klonoa specifically for this release; Yoshizawa felt that the original design for the character was somewhat \\"old-fashioned\\" and would be seen as \\"too cute\\" for Western audiences. This design was met with an overwhelmingly negative reaction from both fans and critics for its \\"depressing\\" and unappealing design, with one comparing it unfavorably to Poochie, a character from The Simpsons created as an necessary change to a television show and who embodies the idea of \\"jumping the shark\\". Namco Bandai scrapped the redesign and kept Klonoa's original design for the North American version. Namco Bandai also made further changes to the North American release, such as omitting the Door to Phantomile subtitle from the Japanese version and adding a new \\"whirlwind\\" attack that slows down any nearby enemies. Klonoa was released in North America on May 2, 2009, and in Europe on May 22. Reception The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning a 77 out of 100 rating from Metacritic. The title experienced low sales in Japan, however, debuting as the 33rd highest- selling game in the region during its first week with only 5,800 copies sold. Reviews of the gameplay have been mixed. Weekly Famitsu felt that the game was overall enjoyable, awarding it a 36 out of 40 score and a Platinum Award, but criticised it for a lack of freshness. The magazine also felt that the graphics had \\"evolved significantly\\", sentiments echoed by Kotaku, who also praised its gameplay while criticizing the game's overall simplicity, calling it a \\"fairly stock platformer\\". GameSpot also felt the game was enjoyable, but criticised the game for being linear and easy. GameSpot praised the game for a large amount of detail, and called the environment \\"bright and colorful\\". IGN similarly praised the colours of the game, calling it \\"visually impressive\\" due to its \\"lush water palette\\" and \\"great water effects\\". 1UP.com compared the graphics to those of the original game's successor, Klonoa 2, and would later include the title in their list of the \\"Six Obscure Wii Games You Must Play\\". Editors of Nintendo Power named Klonoa as one of the 30 \\"Wii Essentials\\" in June 2012, and later ranked it as the 63rd greatest game ever released for a Nintendo console in their farewell issue the following December. GamesRadar placed the game 38th on its own list of the Top 50 Wii games in 2013.

His work continued the tradition of trompe l'oeil still lifes of game of the Netherlandish masters of the 17th century such as Jacob Biltius, Cornelis Biltius and Cornelis Norbertus Gysbrechts. His illusionistic works of game birds against a plain or wooden wall use natural light and shade effects, combined with a very detailed and precise rendering of the plumage to create the trompe l'oeil effect that they appear to be real.

Frequently operating in the shadow of colossal national airlines, which received federal subsidies and flew scheduled passenger service at costly rates, non-scheduled airlines were generally small companies which could be chartered to transport goods or passengers at an hourly or distance- based charge. Non-scheduled airlines were the first to introduce 'aircoach' fares for civilian air travel in the late 1940s, and brought about the low- rate service offered by almost all airlines operating today. Non-scheduled airlines first appeared in significant numbers in the United States after the Second World War, as returning pilots purchased discount surplus planes from the government and set up their own uncertificated air services under the non- scheduled charter service exemption in the 1938 Civil Aviation Act. Low overhead and fewer regulations allowed the non-scheduled airlines to offer considerably lower fares than the national scheduled carriers, inaugurating the immensely popular aircoach service which attracted millions of Americans unable to afford tickets on the regular airlines. Though the regulatory actions of the Civil Aeronautics Board ultimately extinguished the burgeoning non-scheduled industry, the idea of cheap, efficient air transport endured and by the passage of the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act nearly all civil airlines had transitioned to an aircoach model.  Origins  C-47A Skytrains (converted Douglas DC-3s) from the 81st Troop Carrier Squadron, loaded with paratroopers invading southern France (Operation Dragoon) The first non- scheduled airlines arose from the industrial and human fallout of the Second World War. The wartime United States aviation industry had, upon the orders of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, escalated the production of aircraft from a few thousand a year to more than 4,000 each month, and the training centers of the U.S. Army Air Force produced the pilots to fly them.Franklin D. Roosevelt: \\"Campaign Address at Boston, Massachusetts\\", October 30, 1940. Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley,The American Presidency Project Peace brought these airmen, who often possessed no other skills, back to a country where immense stores of surplus military aircraft were being sold at discount rates to former servicemen. Under the 1938 legislation of the Civil Aviation Authority, the federal agency responsible for regulating civil aviation until 1940, all air carriers providing scheduled air service across states required an official certificate to operate, the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. The certificate demanded compliance with economic as well as safety standards, which meant all certificated companies were subject to the CAA's stringent control over fares, routes, and business practices. Nonscheduled air service, which then referred to light aircraft individually chartered to transport cargo, was exempt.Davies and Quastler 1995 p. 23. Snapping up $25,000 Douglas DC-3s, the legendary utility plane which operated in numbers exceeding 10,000 during the war, enterprising pilots established their own freight carriers with ease under the 1938 exemption.Solberg 1979 p. 328. A glut of such companies appeared‚Äî2,730 in 1946 alone according to the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which replaced the CAA in 1940. They had such names as Fireball Air Express or Viking Air Lines, and commonly were operated by a lone individual with some money given by fellow GIs, or in rare cases a bank loan. For most the romantic venture ended in failure; many former fighter pilots found themselves unsuited to the steady cross-country cruising, the bookkeeping required to stay solvent, and the long-term maintenance. With a safety record 14-25 times worse than their scheduled counterparts, the nonscheduled companies (or 'non-skeds', as they came to be called) faced swift punishment from the CAB, which began widely shutting down operations that were found unsafe or \\"financially unfit\\".Corpening 2015 p. 1. CAB retribution was not the most immediate threat to the non-skeds' continued existence, however, and it soon became apparent there were too few contracts to support the influx of new businesses. Hundreds of thinly financed operations went bankrupt within a few months, and ruthless competition for work turned into suicidal rate slashing as non-sked owners undercut air, rail, and naval shipping to prices that failed even to cover their fuel costs. Such cutthroat practices and the poor safety record earned the non-skeds' an ineffaceable reputation as the aviation industry's seedy underbelly.Corpening 2015 p. 5. Savvy non-skeds averted extinction in the late 1940s only by breaching into another market with an innovative service: the aircoach. Though passenger travel was never intended under the economic regulation exemption enjoyed by nonscheduled airlines, its adoption became essential to their business. Because of their low overhead and few amenities, the non-skeds were able to charge close to 40% less than the traditional airlines, with $99.00 fares from Los Angeles to New York City versus $159.00 on a standard carrier.Davies 1987 p. 88. Moreover, unfettered from timetables non-skeds could delay flights until they were full or nearly full, while scheduled airlines had to charge exorbitant prices to ensure profit on half- empty planes.Solberg 1979 p. 346. The non-skeds found a large and willing market for this new service, frequently advertised as 'aircoach' in reference to the established use of 'coach' to mean respectable middle-class travel on trains and ships.Corpening 2015 p. 6. Americans who had never flown before could now afford the luxury formerly reserved for men of business; non-skeds flourished around population-dense cities with big airports. The west coast experienced a remarkable proliferation of nonscheduled passenger airlines, especially near Los Angeles in places like Burbank or Long Beach where land for a dirt airfield could be cheaply obtained. On the east coast Newark and Trenton in New Jersey were popular hangar bases for non-skeds, and the Miami- Caribbean circuit out of Florida was as trafficked as it was lucrative.Corpening 2015 p. 2. One route, from San Juan to New York, facilitated the mass migration of Puerto Ricans seeking opportunity on the mainland who came in numbers exceeding 6,000 each month and settled in squalid conditions in East Harlem. But while the nonscheduled airlines' fares were unmatched throughout the industry, their service quality was frequently unreliable. The low-fare model required that flights be relatively full, and it was a common occurrence when flying on a non-scheduled airline for customers to learn at the airport their flight had been delayed until tomorrow so that the airline could sell more tickets. Because most companies had only a few planes and just the staff to crew them, delays as a result of weather or mechanical failure could completely incapacitate the airline, forcing it to cancel or postpone flights for which tickets had already been sold. No refunds were given on such tickets, and on one occasion the Burbank police responded to calls from a nearby airfield where an angry crowd of passengers were demanding access to an overbooked flight. Some of the nocturnal nonscheduled carriers attempted to evade landing fees at their destinations by covertly slipping in and out of airports in the middle of the night.Corpening 2015 p. 9. However, with the founding of the Aircoach Transportation Association, the trade association and lobbying group of the non-scheduled airlines, stricter policies of etiquette, safety, and consumer protection became standard across the industry. By the close of 1946 non-skeds had become a definite presence within the aviation industry, and they found themselves looked unfavorably upon by executives at the old established airlines.  Conflict  Major scheduled airlines‚Äîthe likes of United, American, and TWA‚Äîwere still receiving federal subsidies and airmail pay when they began lobbying the CAB to protect their interests against the upstart nonscheduled airlines. The CAB, charged originally with promoting competition to the benefit of the consumer, acceded to the airlines' demands and on 5 May 1947 enacted new regulatory measures targeting nonscheduled airlines‚Äînow termed 'irregular carriers'. The measures distinguished between Small Irregular Carriers, services operating light chartered aircraft weighing less than 10,000 pounds when fully loaded (changed in 1949 to 12,500), and Large Irregular Carriers, those flying equipment, the DC-3 for example, in excess of that weight. The small remained unrestricted, but the large carriers faced a host of new economic and safety regulations along with a warning to adhere to 'infrequent and irregular' service. The most important of the new rules was the need for a Letter of Registration in order to fly large aircraft; the CAB issued 142 of these in 1947 but stopped in August 1948 when the board began an investigation of the practices of large irregular carriers, which it accused of operating as scheduled services.Corpening 2015. p. 8. Earlier that year the CAB had instituted what became known as the \\"3 and 8 rule\\" which limited nonscheduled airlines' monthly flights to eight between any two U.S. cities and three on specified high-density routes.Davies 1987 p. 87. No non-sked could feasibly sustain itself on such a slim diet, and the measure was viewed as a death sentence by leaders of the irregular air industry. Nonetheless, a select group of non- skeds not only persevered but prospered in the ensuing years, though many were far from scrupulous in their observance of the CAB's economic constraints. DC-3 in May 1955. One such entrepreneur was the co-founder of Fireball Air Express, Stanley D. Weiss, who early in 1949 formed a ticketing agency called North American Airlines with Ross R. Hart and Jack B. Lewin, the founders of his principal competitor Viking Air Lines. While the individual companies retained their Letters of Registration, and therefore their monthly allowance of flights, North American Airlines sold the tickets, advertised its brand, and arranged their flights. In effect, Weiss created a conglomerate which doubled the amount of monthly flights allotted to his company and rebranded the technically disparate components with the North American Airlines logo, such that any passenger would believe they were dealing with a single entity. He then acquired more nonscheduled airlines‚ÄîTwentieth Century Airlines, Trans- American Airlines, Trans-National Airlines, and Hemisphere Air Transport‚Äîto bring North American Airlines' de facto fleet to 14 DC-3s and 1 DC-4, and to ensure the \\"3 and 8\\" limit would never again strangle their business.Davies 1987 p. 87-8. Another non-sked businessman named Irving Herman became Weiss' chief competitor through a similar scheme called Super Skycoach, which comprised Great Lakes Airlines, Currey Air Transport, and Trans Alaskan Airlines held together by the Trans Continental Airlines ticketing agency.Corpening 2015 p. 13. In setting up his evasive business, however, Herman acted with greater caution than Weiss, whose bold maneuver attracted the ire of both scheduled airlines and the CAB. In January 1949, the CAB concluded its investigation and announced plans to roll out significantly harsher regulations along with a series of punitive measures aimed at irregular air carriers, all of which were presumed guilty of some infraction during the preceding years. The new mandate would suspend each large irregular passenger carrier's license to operate pending a thorough review, and restrict the non-skeds' flight limit even further to varied weekly flights and four round trips per month between any two destinations. Additionally, the CAB introduced statutes prohibiting cost-sharing between non-skeds and requiring that each have their own ticketing agencies, effectively banning the elusive combine schemes.Graham, Frederick. \\"100 Irregular Airlines Fear their Doom in CAB Curbs.\\" New York Times (1923-Current file), Jan 10, 1949, pp. 1. ProQuest. James McCauley Landis, hailed as one of the best legal minds of the century, briefly headed the CAB and planned to liberalize air regulation before a dramatic fall from power. The response was collective and vehement outrage.\\"Nonscheduled Air Lines Hit Federal Ruling.\\" Los Angeles Times (1923‚Äì1995), Apr 22, 1949, pp. 17. ProQuest. In hearings at the Capitol, representatives of the nonscheduled airlines denounced the CAB as the servant of major scheduled carriers that \\"have used every conceivable and questionable device to force the healthful competition of the irregular carriers out of existence\\", as said by James Fischgrund. One lawyer called the proposed action \\"wholesale injustice by the shotgun method.\\" The representatives acknowledged that a few \\"bad apples\\" existed within the non-scheduled industry, but vociferously denied that all non-skeds purposefully violated CAB stricture and deserved a blanket punishment. They also defended their usefulness to the American public, arguing they provided access to air travel for the 90% of Americans who could not afford the regular carriers' fares, and inspired some degree of competition that was previously nonexistent under the CAB's tight economic controls. The New York Port Authority and, unexpectedly, the Department of Justice contributed their support to the non-skeds' cause, requesting that the CAB delay its order until the value of the nonscheduled airline industry could be reassessed. The CAB offered no such reprieve. On 14 April 1949 the CAB notified large irregular carriers they had thirty days from the effective date of 20 May to apply for interim licenses while the new order took effect. That same month the Senate Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, which had been investigating why scheduled carriers were still unprofitable despite federal subsidies of $100,000,000, turned its attention to the plight of the non-skeds. Senator Edwin C. Johnson, president of the committee, gathered testimony from the nonscheduled airline representatives, the leadership of the CAB, independent fiscal and legal analysts, the former CAB chairman James M. Landis, and Robert Ramspeck, executive vice president of the Air Transport Association, which represented the regular carriers. After three months of hearings, Johnson presented his findings to the CAB with a formal request that the nonscheduled airlines' licenses be reinstated and the stringent measures repealed. Again, the CAB declined. The chairman, Joseph J. O'Connell Jr., replied that to comply with senator Johnson's demand \\"would be to condone flagrant violations of our regulations in the past and encourage disrespect for them in the future.\\" Less than thirty days later the CAB filed its first round of criminal charges with the Department of Justice against Standard Air Lines, the company run by the nonscheduled airlines' most prominent spokesperson, James Fischgrund. The CAB accused Standard of violating its \\"irregular\\" doctrine by flying more frequently than permitted, offering a service indistinguishable from the scheduled airlines. On 21 July the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia rejected Fischgrund's appeal and ordered Standard to cease and desist.Hurd, Charles. \\"CAB Order Upheld on Halting Airline.\\" New York Times (1923-Current file), Jul 22, 1949, pp. 17. ProQuest. Viking Air Lines was next, eliminated in June 1950 for operating excessive flights and charging fares not prescribed by the CAB. Seaboard & Western Airlines and Transocean Air Lines, though spared, were censured and ordered to immediately discontinue practices not expressly approved in the CAB's regulations under penalty of dissolution. By 11 June 1950, there were 96 nonscheduled airlines left in the country. That this many remained despite a concerted effort by the CAB to put them out of business was due entirely to the Cold War. In times of national emergency the non-skeds undertook scores of cargo and passenger contracts from the military, fulfilling an essential service to the country while sustaining their enterprises. Seaboard & Western, Transocean, and Slick Airways notably aided the US Air Force in performing the Berlin Airlift in 1948‚Äì1949. The non-skeds transported supplies across the country and the Atlantic Ocean to Rhein-Main Air Base, where the Air Force and Navy's combined fleet of C-54s was continuously engaged in airdropping necessary commodities into West Berlin. And again once the United Nations approved a US-led intervention in Korea in 1950, non-skeds took on the role of flying men and mat√©riel to Japan, where the military transported them to the front. 50% of all cargo and personnel brought to the conflict were delivered by nonscheduled airlines, with special note going to Transocean and National Overseas Airways. The non-skeds proved to be the only non-military transports capable of carrying out such a colossal effort without receiving advance warning or impacting the domestic commercial network of the United States. Financial security was not the only benefit non- skeds enjoyed from their relationship with the armed forces, however‚Äîthe respect of the military gave them a crucial ally in government with the potential to counterbalance the CAB. Juan Trippe on the cover of a 1933 issue of Time Magazine Meanwhile, the scheduled airlines still had to deal with those non-scheduled airlines successfully flying passenger service. Their low fares had tapped into a vast market of potential customers which the CAB's strict fare regulations made inaccessible to scheduled carriers. The scheduled airlines, furthermore, had to service unprofitable routes and regions as a condition of their federal subsidies, forcing them to raise fares on their gainful flights to compensate. In November 1948 Capital Airlines, a minor scheduled carrier, won approval from the CAB to begin nightly coach service between New York and Chicago.Heppenheimer 1995 p. 127. The other scheduled carriers watched as Capital's new offering replicated the success of the nonscheduled airlines, and soon began petitioning the CAB to authorize their own low-fare lines. Juan Trippe, President of Pan-American Airlines, had established a $75.00 one-way service between San Juan and New York in September 1948, and by 1950 each of the \\"Big Four\\" airlines (American, United, Eastern, and TWA) offered 'tourist-class' service with pared down amenities and prices attractive to the average middle-class American.Heppenheimer 1995 p. 126-8. Of course, each route had to be confirmed by the CAB, which, scantily staffed, was notoriously lethargic in its dealings. Several routes for which demand clearly existed lacked coach service well into the subsequent decade, acting as a continual source of embarrassment for the Board which insisted that federally-backed scheduled airlines perfectly served the needs of the American public.  Fall  Edward J. Thye Over the early 1950s the CAB further increased its powers over large irregular carriers and continued investigating their operations. In 1952 the CAB implemented new rules for pilots at nonscheduled airlines, requiring compliance with stricter standards of training and experience. The CAB also won jurisdiction over ticketing agencies from Congress, enabling the Board to take action against the likes of North American Airlines, the largest and most lucrative of the combine schemes. The Aircoach Transport Association, however, expressed its approval of CAB-controlled ticketing agencies. For, many of the nonscheduled airlines had developed an unhealthy dependence upon agencies, and in the last few years ticket-sellers had begun exploiting their relationship by demanding higher commissions from their clients, in some cases 50% of earned revenue. But the ATA found little else worthy of approbation in the CAB's actions, and on 30 March 1953 its general manager Hamlin B. Johnston issued a statement accusing the CAB of executing \\"a planned program to destroy the independent airline industry.\\" A meeting of the Senate Subcommittee on Small Business Relations with Government convened to investigate, this time under the chairmanship of Senator Edward J. Thye, and uncovered an internal CAB memorandum written by Louis Goodkind in 1948. Goodkind, then chief of economic relations and now leader of the Board's investigation into irregular airlines, had detailed a plot to eradicate the industry by tightening regulations until all \\"undesirables\\" were vanquished. Finally, the nonscheduled airlines had proof that the CAB sought to do more than enforce its regulations; the Board tried to eliminate the only profitable sector of America's air travel industry, either under pressure from certificated carriers or in fear of the chaos a deregulated airspace might cause. But the divulgence of the Goodkind memo, the military's recent commendation of the non-skeds, and the Senate committee's continued exhortations forced the Board's leadership to reverse course. In May 1955, the Board still tentatively opposed nonscheduled airlines, as demonstrated by a newly published report recommending that half their number be terminated‚Äîbut by November of that year the most radical liberalizing legislation since the original loophole in the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 was introduced.Caged monkeys aboard a Transocean flight in the mid-1950s, transported in the thousands from India to make Polio vaccines The Board's new regulations permitted large irregular carriers, rebranded \\"Supplemental Airlines\\", to operate ten individually ticketed flights a month between any two points, without regard to frequency, regularity, route density, or any other metric. Furthermore, no limits were placed on flights chartered by a group renting the entire plane, or on transporting cargo. After a decade of hostility from the public and private sectors, the nonscheduled airlines were elated to finally join the accepted members of the commercial aviation community; they eagerly awaited the effective starting date of 1 January 1956. On 15 December 1955, however, the scheduled carriers and railroads intervened. Both groups feared the nonscheduled airlines' low fares, and individually petitioned the board to reconsider its order. The case went to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which on 19 July 1956 announced its unanimous ruling: The CAB order lacked sufficient evidence to justify the measure. The effort to legitimize nonscheduled carriers had not died, however, and on 29 January 1959 the CAB created, after an exhaustive research process, the supplemental carrier class of airlines. 23 temporary Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity were issued to those of the fifty or so remaining non-skeds that passed the application process, and these were subject to the terms of the failed 1955 regulation. The rest were ordered to cease doing business within sixty days. Again, the matter became embroiled in the courts: First, the US Court of Appeals in D.C. struck down the order as an overreach of the CAB's authority on 13 April 1960; next, the CAB successfully appealed to the United States Supreme Court for a final ruling; and finally, on 24 October 1960, the Supreme Court vacated the Circuit Court's decision until either the temporary certificates expired or Congress passed permanent legislation to address issue. Luckily for the supplemental carriers, 11 of whose certificates would have expired 29 January 1961, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill granting all certificated supplementals interim authority for twenty months while Congress deliberated. The legislature's final act on the question of these few surviving non-skeds came on 10 July 1962‚Äîbut a series of catastrophes came first. A Lockheed C-69 Constellation of the kind crashed by Imperial Airways on 9 November 1961. For over a decade, the nonscheduled airlines' safety record earned the envy of the aviation industry. Most of them had won the National Safety Council's Aviation Safety Award for a year without accident and three years with below-average accident rates; many had earned the honor twice. But a 1961 study by the Federal Aviation Administration found that airlines suffering financially tended to experience a drop in safety standards, and by 1960 several of the extant supplementals were in poor fiscal health. The years of battling protean regulations and competing for a fluctuating supply of contracts had whittled the once-abundant non-skeds down to a few dozen companies, many of which barely limped along despite their updated classification. On 19 September 1960, a World Airways Douglas DC-6A took off from Guam carrying military personnel and their families, 80 of whom were killed when the plane crashed shortly thereafter. A C-46 flown by Arctic-Pacific Airlines crashed over Ohio on 29 October 1960, killing 22 of the 48 members of California Polytechnic Institute's returning football team. After making a wrong turn, President Airline's DC-6B crashed into the River Shannon on 10 September 1961 leaving 83 dead. 74 soldiers aboard an Imperial Airways flight died on 8 November 1961 when the Lockheed 069 Constellation hired to transport them crashed near Richmond, Virginia while attempting an emergency landing. Subsequent investigations found that crew fatigue, mechanical failures resulting from incompetent maintenance, and poorly trained pilots lay behind each disaster. In one case the crew had been flying without rest for more than 25 hours; in another the pilot had failed his flight test three times. These needless‚Äîand widely publicized‚Äîtragedies bore heavily upon the House representatives and senators as they crafted Public Law 87-528, passed on 10 July 1962. According to the text of the law, currently certificated supplemental carriers would all need to reapply for a certificate, which, if granted, gave the bearer rights to operate chartered service for civilian or military contracts within an individually-defined geographic area. Separately ticketed flights were not permitted unless a carrier demonstrated to the CAB's satisfaction that service in a specific area or along a certain route was needed. Competition, which had given rise to the non-skeds and perpetuated their existence, was thoroughly rooted out. Each would operate within their own delineated territory, and when the CAB did allow for scheduled service only one carrier per route was given the privilege.Ludolf R. Kubnell III, Supplemental Air Transportation ‚Äì Public Law 87-528, 28 J. Air L. & Com. 453 (1962) https://scholar.smu.edu/jalc/vol28/iss4/15 Just fifteen supplemental carriers obtained the certificate, and any providing ticketed passenger flights were ordered to transition to all-charter service by 10 July 1964. Two carriers failed to make the transition, and the rest found themselves no safer after the deadline. Their principal source of revenue, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), at first awarded contracts only to a select group of seven supplemental carriers represented by the National Air Carrier Association, an agency headed by Coates Lear. Lear also happened to be a business associate of the recently appointed Secretary of the Air Force. His sudden death in 1963 did not mean the end of the supplemental carriers' troubles with military contracts, however, as the escalation of the Vietnam War impelled MATS to demand greater standards from their contractors. MATS declared that in order to qualify for contracts supplemental carriers must earn at least 30% of their revenue from civilian-chartered services, a measure designed to attract only the most robust carriers. MATS soon added that only carriers flying jet aircraft could take their contracts. Within a few years, all but those in compliance with the MATS directives had fallen into bankruptcy, leaving the constricted group of some half-dozen supplemental carriers the lone progeny of the postwar non-skeds. The size of this cluster, though not its composition, remained constant through the following decade, until in 1976 the question of \\"The Decline of the Supplemental Carrier in the United States\\" appeared before the Senate Select Committee on Small Business. The hearings formed part of an accelerating trend toward deregulation in the commercial aviation industry, which culminated in the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act. In the years following the act's passage the entire structure of federal airline regulation was dismantled, including the CAB. Regulated classifications such as supplemental carrier or scheduled carrier disappeared as the government reintroduced competition between airlines, and a volatile ecosystem of civil aviation succeeded the CAB's stale bureaucracy. However, the Act also rendered nonscheduled airline service redundant, an innovation suited to an outmoded system of regulation; the last remaining airline founded as a nonscheduled carrier, World Airways, ceased operations in early 2014.

Training and activities  Born in Ch√¢teau-Thierry, Weber began his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris in 1941. First Grand Prix de Rome in 1952, he won the same year the Sogeda Prize for his ballet Le Petit Jeu. Lecturer at the Conservatoire de Paris since 1957, he taught preparation for the teaching profession, solf√®ge and counterpoint, then in 1970 he assumed the function of professor advisor to studies. The Grand Prix du disque fran√ßais was awarded to him in 1982 for his television work La Rivi√®re Perdue. President of many juries, he was also a member of the symphonic commission of the SACEM (1980‚Äì83), then of the reading committee of Radio France. He carried out numerous educational missions abroad (Tunisia, Canada, Yugoslavia, Taiwan...). Alain Weber was an officer of the Ordre national du M√©rite.  Technique and aesthetics  Weber's work focuses on an exploration of forms of writing that are constantly being renewed. Parallel to some serials works freely treated (Variations pour dixtuor, 1965 - Synecdoque pour hautbois, 1970), he developed a writing in quarter tones (Saxophone Quartet, 1984 - Constellaire, 1994). He also employed various techniques of indeterministic composition, such as certain uses of transparent sheets, which, seen from different angles, generate transformations of pre-established melodic and harmonic propositions (Linear I, II, III, respectively for saxophone and orchestra, for octet, and for sextet of ondes Martenot, 1973‚Äì77). Fascinated by poetic forms, he knows how to reconnect with the spirit of the pantoum (Strophes, 1965), and acrostic (√âtudes Acrostiches, 1973), also inspired by the phonemes of Jean Cocteau's Po√®me de l'√âtoile to create a vocal expression in onomatopoeias (Phon√®minie, 1983 - Le \\"Chan\\" du Potager, 1984). He composed a musical tale for children (Le rus√© petit Jean, 1984), but also instrumental works: his pedagogical research led him to use random, a rather flexible technique, assimilable by young performers (Concertante for guitar and guitars, 1993). Each work poses a different musical problem, however, Weber's compositions evolve through a certain unity, never revealing a real break.

She founded Japari School, a special school in Johannesburg that provides education for children who struggle to thrive in the mainstream education system. She wrote a series of four graded reading books (Sounds Travel Too) and other reading tutors in English and Afrikaans (Tom Kan Lees) that were widely used throughout the 1960s and 1970s for teaching the phonics reading method, as well as articles concerning the treatment of children with learning difficulties.  Early life and education  Machanick was the second of three children born in Cape Town to immigrant parents; her mother from the United Kingdom and her father from Lithuania. Her mother, Edna Annie Love Courtnall, was one of the first female LLB graduates (1922) at the University of London, and she later set up a National Fellowship Award through the South African Association of Women graduates. Awards every year are made to two South African women who are studying for a Dipoma or Degree in any discipline. After completing school, Sonia Machanick enrolled on the medical course at Cape Town University. While a student, she initiated a vacation scheme for medical students to provide medical support at a mission hospital in the Transkei and she was a member of the team that inaugurated SHAWCO, a student-run NGO based at the University of Cape Town, that seeks to improve the quality of life for individuals in developing communities within the Cape Metropolitan area. After graduating in 1947, she returned to the main university campus to study psychology and she worked at the University Child Guidance Clinic. She married Hillel Abbe Shapiro who was a lecturer at the university medical school.  Career  Soon after, they relocated to Johannesburg where she was initially employed at the Alexandra Township TB clinic and then as a registrar at Tara Hospital. These experiences informed her decision to forge a career in the area of remedial education, with the specific aim of developing facilities for the diagnosis and treatment of children whose emotional and educational needs were not catered for in the mainstream educational system and she started working with children who struggled with a range of learning problems, including emotional behavioural issues, dyslexia and dyspraxia. Together with her husband and a group of other parents, Sonia Machanick was instrumental in founding South Africa's first mainstream multi-racial high school, Woodmead School.  JAPARI School  As her practice grew, the need for larger premises led to her setting up Japari School in Johannesburg in 1966. The school expanded further with new buildings and was able to take larger numbers of children as well as hosting conferences and work placements for special needs teachers. Although this was during the Apartheid era, Japari operated from the start on a non-racial basis, and also supported black pupils with scholarships to mainstream schools. After her early death aged 52 in 1977, there was a period of uncertainty, after which the school re-established itself on a new site. Dr Machanick's work in the field of educational research was recognised by the College of Medicine of South Africa, and the College established the Sonia Machanick Travelling Fellowship.Prof. I.

Description  Cheirostylis ovata is a tuberous, perennial herb with a rosette of between three and seven leaves, long and wide lying flat on the ground. Up to six resupinate white flowers, long and wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and fused with the petals and with the lower half of the lateral sepals to form a tube. The lateral sepals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal and the petals are the same length but about half as wide. The labellum is long and about wide, its tip divided into two lobes with broad teeth on the edges. Flowering occurs from August to October. Taxonomy and naming The banded fleshy jewel orchid was first formally described in 1896 by Frederick Manson Bailey who gave it the name Gastrodia ovata and published the name in the Department of Agriculture Botany Bulletin. In 1911, Rudolf Schlechter changed the name to Cheirostylis ovata. The specific epithet (ovata) is a Latin word meaning \\"egg-shaped\\".

Never profitable, it operated for three years before the company abandoned the venture in the aftermath of the Darwin rebellion. Most of the facility was demolished in 1957, but two large water tanks are still standing today, on what is now the site of the Darwin High School on Bullocky Point in the suburb of The Gardens. The beach to the north of Bullocky Point is called Vestey's beach as a result of the meatworks.  Construction  Construction of a meatworks began at Bullocky Point in 1914. It was completed in 1917 for a total cost of ¬£1 million. Construction employed 500 or more men at the time. In mid-November 1917 construction started on two water tanks due to the insufficient amount of bore water available on the site. Of the six bores onsite only four worked, and they were not producing enough to meet the demands of the meatworks and fill the giant tank, which had a capacity of almost 5 million gallons (18.92 million litres). On 16 February 1918 the tanks were finished and half full of water. When full both tanks could hold 5 million gallons combined. The tank displays considerable technical innovation and achievement, with the sand and gravel being crushed from rock on site. It is amongst the earliest substantial uses of reinforced concrete in the Northern Territory; it is one of the largest above ground concrete tanks built before the end of World War I, and is of a distinctive rectangular shape A section of the workforce was also involved at this time in making bricks for the mess and canteen. The clay for the bricks came from an area between the Fannie Bay Gaol and the former Golf Links. It travelled down a light tramway, following the contours of the land. The kiln was situated in an area that is now used by Darwin Sailing club as a ‚Äòhard stand‚Äô for yachts. The diggings left a series of little lagoons, which is now Lake Alexander. The brickworks had been established in the 1870s by David Daniels to provide bricks for the Government Stamp Batteries on the gold fields. The walls of the freezer chiller building were insulated with pumice.  Operation  The meatworks had a capacity to process 55 head a day, with a freezer capacity of 6,000 t, the largest in Australia at the time. The meatworks only operated for three seasons. In April 1917, killing commenced for a 14-week season. and processed nearly 18,911 cattle, the majority coming from Vestey‚Äôs properties. The first shipment of frozen meat dispatched on 13 December 1917. About 460 men were employed and 1,680 cattle were being processed each week. The 1918 season processed 29,000 cattle, 500 beasts could be killed and chilled, 500 carcases frozen and 200 canned a day, the majority from Vestey‚Äôs properties. The 1919 season was a short operating season and 21,866 head were processed before union disputes caused problems, which in part led to the Darwin Rebellion.Pastoral Australia: Fortunes, Failures & hard Yakka, M. Pearson, J. Lennon, 2010 In three years of operation the processed meat was valued at ¬£1,029,271.  Closure and abandonment  The meat works were closed on 17 March 1920. Vestey's blamed the labour indiscipline and poor quality of local cattle. On 8 July 1923 a fire destroyed the three storey men's accommodation block and a couple of adjoining buildings. In 1925 the meat works opened briefly to operate as a boiling down works. A total of 9,600 head were turned into tallow but Vestey's claimed a loss on operations. With its closure, more than three quarters of the population found itself unemployed. As families moved away from Darwin in search of work, the Parap School (which had been opened in 1917) was closed, and as the number of secondary students dropped from 125 to 15 in 1925, the High School ceased to offer secondary education. During the period 1925 to 1939 locals used to surreptitiously used the water tanks as a swimming facility. = Second World War = The abandoned Vestey's meatworks was used by the Darwin Mobile Force as their barracks from March 1939 until August 1940. In 1942, with the Japanese air force on the verge of reaching Australia, military authorities feared the tank would give invaders a reliable water supply and allow them to get further inland. A local plumber, George Parker, was charged with blowing up the tank in the event of an invasion. He was also given two cyanide tablets to take in case of capture, and it is understood that when the bombing of Darwin began on 19 February 1942, he was actually at the tanks with his charges set and ready to go. During the Second World War it was used by the military to billet men and store materials. On 26 July 1942 at 9:15 pm in the evening the meatworks site was bombed by the Japanese and suffered minor damage. It was again bombed on 24 August 1942. In 1943, it was again bombed on 28 June. = Demolition = In 1956 was demolished with the exception of the water tanks. In 1962 construction of Darwin High School began on the site and was occupied on 3 October 1963.  Current  The only remnants of the Vestey's meatworks are the two adjoining water tanks. One of which (the eastern one) had a roof put on it and was turned into a gymnasium for the high school and was opened in 1987. The tank had its official opening on 9 September 1987, but was well in use both by the school and the community from the day the workmen finished in 1987. The new-look tank was a gymnasium for the school, but because it was now the biggest indoor venue in Darwin, it quickly became popular for all kinds of social occasions such as gala balls. It was listed as Vestey's Tank on the Northern Territory Heritage Register on 29 July 2006. The western tank was turned into a sheltered grassed court yard.

It is also known as Cottage No. 12 or the Old Dormitory Building. It is a surviving feature of the institution variously known as the Mittagong Training School for Boys and Mittagong (later Renwick) Farm Home, State Ward Home or Children's Home. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 March 2014.  History  =Aboriginal land= Gundungurra or Gandangarra people lived in the Southern Highlands area, which includes Mittagong, for many thousands of years. People who spoke the Gundungurra language lived in the Blue Mountains, the Southern Highlands and the Goulburn Plains of New South Wales. They lived in small groups of extended family members, who were attached to particular areas of country. After Anglo- European settlers caused displacement of Gundungurra people, they often worked on farms or grazing properties within and adjacent to their traditional land.Di Johnson: 2004 in SHR database 5045486 Gundungurra groups left archaeological evidence of their occupation throughout their traditional lands, including scarred trees where bark was removed for use as a boat or other object, grinding grooves on rocks where axes were ground, and occupation sites which include middens. Well-worn Gundungurra pathways on ridge tops were often the routes used as the first roads by colonists.Di Johnson 2004 Possibly this could have been the origin of the Old South Road which borders part of the Renwick site.SHR database 5045486 =Colonisation= Early European explorers visited the area in the 1810s. The earliest road was the Old South Road to the east of the later township of Mittagong. An inn was established at the property facing the Old South Road by George Cutter and opened as the Kangaroo Inn in 1827, following the initial grant of land 1823. When the main road to the south was relocated by Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell in 1830 to its present location through Mittagong and Berrima, the coaching trade declined and the inn was sold to explorer Charles Sturt in 1836 who apparently used it as a residence. Surviving evidence of the inn became part of Renwick Farm Home and the early 19th century buildings became incorporated into Hassall and Jefferis Cottages. Two nearby early 19th century Crown land grants in the area went to Robert Plumb and one to John Thomas Wilson. On these lands the Southwood Estate was established and came under the ownership of Stephen John Pearson and John Douse Langley. The western half of the Southwood Estate was subdivided in 1886. The balance of the estate including the eastern side (approximately 397 acres) was purchased by the government in 1907 for use as a farm for delinquent boys. This land along with some later purchases became the Mittagong Farm Homes (later Renwick Home). By 1918 Renwick was 427 acres.Tanner 2005 Institutionalising children In the 19th century there were several large institutions operating as orphanages and reform schools in the colony of NSW. These included the Female Orphan School (1801 - 1850), the Male Orphan School (1818 - 1850), Randwick Asylum for Destitute Children (1852 -1916) and the Protestant Orphan School (1850 - 1886). In the 1870s Judge Winderer headed a Royal Commission on Public Charities and its two reports of 1873 and 1874 advocated a \\"boarding-out\\" or fostering system rather than the large orphanages of the day. This boarding-out system was similar in many respects to modern day foster-care. The State Children's Relief Board, which was constituted by Parliament in 1881 to remove children from orphanages and place them in foster care. However some children were considered to need different forms of care because they were crippled, mentally disabled and or suffering from disease. In his second Annual Report, Dr Arthur Renwick, Chair of the Board, advocated for special cottages to be established for the care of these children. Early in 1885, four Cottage Homes were established: two at Pennant Hills and one each at Picton and Mittagong. Mittagong soon became a popular place to send unwell children, as it provided, \\"a wholesome country environment essential for building up their health\\". Some children attended the local school, others only convalesced. Soon there were six cottages around Mittagong.Downie 2013 =Mittagong Farm Home= By 1886, Dr Renwick was advocating the purchase of a farm which would provide milk, fruit and vegetables that the children needed. He also advocated that the cottages should be purpose built for the children. Thus in 1896, 100 acres of the \\"Southwood Estate\\" (on which there stood a commodious cottage) were leased for a five-year period. In 1900, the first of some \\"otherwise unmanageable\\" boys were sent to Mittagong. They were put to work at the \\"Cottage Farm Home\\". This name was changed to The Farm Home, Mittagong, in 1902. It was an auxiliary to the Cottage Homes, which were now designated for use by \\"the crippled and feeble minded\\". Thus the dual roles of Mittagong homes were established, a role that was to exist until 1976. On 5 June 1906 in accordance with the provisions of the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act, 1905 the Farm Home for Boys at Mittagong was proclaimed an Industrial School and a Probationary Training Home for delinquent boys aged 8 to 17. These were boys convicted in the Children's Courts of less serious offences including truanting, being uncontrollable, being neglected and wandering, breaching probation, stealing, and breaking and entering. 81 boys were admitted in the first six months. Hassel Cottage was opened as a \\"Probationary Training Home\\" in 1906, and the ten years that followed saw the building of Haydon, Goodlet, Renwick, Mackellar and De Lauret Cottages. A superintendent's cottage was constructed in 1910 and remained in use until 1966, when it was extended to allow accommodation for boys. Turner Cottage was built on The Lindens Estate in 1915, originally as a cottage for mentally defective girls, then was later used as the Cottage Hospital until the Hospital moved to the Farm Home. After acquisition of the freehold title in 1906 the Board instigated extensive capital improvements which made the estate a successful working farm. Initial improvements included a silo, steam engine and wood cutting machinery. Large areas were cultivated for vegetables with six acres set aside as a training plot. There was also a piggery, orchard, dairy, stables, coach house and dams. The Farm was worked by the residents and ran self-sufficiently for many years. The most intensive agriculture on the farm was the orchard and associated packing, sorting and jam making facilities. By the 1950s the Farm had a dairy herd of 70 cows, an orchard which supplied the home and other institutions with apples, plums, etc. and a small cannery. Industrial activities also took place on the Farm - boot making, tailoring and carpentry instructors provided training in industrial trades on the site for residents. Boys also received training during the construction phases on site in building trades such as brick-laying, plumbing and painting. The bricks for the building works were also manufactured on site by the boys. The boys were in the charge of an attendant and matron (usually a married couple). Boys under 14 (and older boys with a low standard of education) attended lower Mittagong Public School. The older boys, under the supervision of the attendant, worked on the Farm lands adjacent to the Home cultivating fruit and vegetables, dairying and raising poultry. Most boys stayed at Mittagong for short periods. Boys who were responsive to the program at Mittagong were released on probation to a relative, boarded-out or apprenticed out, and those who showed no evidence of reform were sent to the Farm Home for Boys, Gosford. During the years of World War I, Aboriginal children were admitted to the Farm in response to the Aborigines Protection Amendment Act which was causing the removal of Aboriginal children from their families. Although a Royal Commission in 1920 recommended against placing Aboriginal children in the same homes as white children, residents have confirmed that many of the children at the Farm were Aboriginal. By 1919, there were 230 children, some going to school and others involved in training programmes, including orcharding, dairying, general farming, tailoring, boot making, carpentry and poultry, and pig farming. During the 1930s, Suttor Cottage was built to house mentally defective boys, and used for this purpose until the closure of the old Mittagong Public School next to Turner Cottage; the boys were then transferred to Turner Cottage, and Turners old school then functioned as a truant school. There was a fairly strong feeling amongst the townspeople of Mittagong to have all the cottages centralised on \\"Southwood Estate\\". This led to the buying of \\"Rotherwood\\", a property on which the Rotherwood cottage was built. The original house on the property was used as the Hospital Cottage until its closure in 1976. A large increase in delinquents led to the opening of Challoner Cottage in the early 1940s. In December 1948 eight cottages existed for delinquents, three for state wards and one hospital cottage, with the population fluctuating between 200 and 250 children.Downie 2013 Initially the cottages were referred to by number but over time were assigned names. Challoner Cottage was also known as Cottage 12. From 1947 the Institution was called the Mittagong Training School for Boys. On 23 August 1974 a new cottage for younger boys was opened, enabling a maximum population of 180 boys. The average stay at the institution was four to five months. The Mittagong Training School for Boys was gradually phased out as a Home for Delinquent Boys. In 1968 Linden was built for girls, Garran in 1969, for girls and Rotherwood in 1969 for boys. In 1964, delinquent numbers increased, this led to the demolishing and rebuilding of DeLauret. Also in that year Linden became the first co-ed cottage. This was such a success that Garran and Rotherwood became co-ed in 1976. On 30 June 1976 only 33 boys were in residence. In August 1976 the Institution ceased to operate as a Training Centre and the remaining boys were transferred to Ormond House, Thornleigh. Subsequently, Mittagong Training School for Boys was established as a home for dependent children and became part of the newly named centre, Renwick. In 1976 the Training School for Boys at Mittagong was officially closed and the following cottages ceased to be used: Hassal, Jefferis, Renwick, Mackellar, Goodlet and Heydon, along with the Hospital Cottage. The 200 residents at that time were either discharge or transferred to other centres. The property was renamed Renwick in honour of the first president of the State Children's Relief Board, Sir Arthur Renwick. Challoner and De Lauret cottages were adapted to accommodate male and female State wards. By the 1980s, 160 state wards were accommodated at: Turner, Waverley and Lindon in Mittagong, and Rotherwood, Garran and Suttor on the Southwood Estate and DeLauret and Rowe along Bong Bong Road. Challoner ceased being used for delinquent boys in 1978. Renwick finally closed in 1994. =Challoner Cottage= The first building at Renwick to be designed by the Government Architect's Office, Challoner Cottage (number 12) was completed in 1941, replacing cottage number 8, which was demolished due to its poor condition. Named after Edward Challoner, the chief clerk of the Child Welfare Department in the 1930s, number 12 cottage was not designed as an intimate cottage like the others on the Farm. More institutional, the building housed dormitories and associated rooms over two storeys on a cruciform plan. Downstairs was the dining room, common room and locker room and upstairs were three dormitories. Challoner Cottage was used as a home for delinquent boys until 1976, and then became a home for disturbed male wards. The Renwick institution was finally closed in 1994. In February 2013, government development agency Landcom proposed to demolish the cottage to make way for a two-lot subdivision as part of its broader residential development of the former farm home. The Wingecarribee Shire opposed the demolition and recommended that it be heritage listed. Following the building's heritage listing in March 2014, the state government put the use of the property out to tender. Former residents who had survived abuse at the facility claimed that the state government had reneged on a promise to allow them to use the building as a museum and youth centre. The Renwick Association had offered $232,000, the value placed on the site by planning authorities, paid in $10,000 annual instalments. The association noted that the Renwick victims had not sought compensation and viewed the deal as a way of authorities making amends with the victims. Challoner Cottage has been unoccupied for a number of years and while structurally sound, is in a deteriorated state.  Description  Challoner Cottage is located on Lot 61 DP 1142602, an irregularly shaped block which is different to the original fenced yard around the building. The building is located approximately 26 metres from Bong Bong Road and along its frontage is a dense row of mature Conifers. There is also a row of mature Conifers on the south western corner boundary of the site forming a windbreak to a garden in front of the building. Challoner Cottage is a two-storey solid brick building on a cruciform plan with a multi hipped and tiled roof with seven brick chimneys. There is an external concrete fire stair on the northern side. The main entry has a concrete porch and is on the southern elevation facing Bong Bong Road, there are other entries from the north and east. The ground floor consisted of kitchen, bathrooms, laundry, locker room and offices and upstairs were dormitories and accommodation for staff. Early photographs show the eastern side of the yard was once cultivated as a flower garden. Around the flower garden was a circular gravel driveway connecting to Bong Bong Road. No evidence of the garden or circular drive can be seen today, only the straight length of driveway to the road remains. This stretch of driveway is bordered on its western side by a low brick retaining wall which serves to raise the level of the front lawn area. To the north west of the main building is a shelter shed with a concrete slab floor, brick walls and a tiled roof. Inside the shelter shed is an open area which is open along one side and has enclosed rooms at either end. Inside are the remains of timber seats. Challoner Cottage is located in a group of five cottages from the Mittagong Farm Home that all face Bong Bong Road and are separated from each other by vegetation and short distances. Immediately to the west is Goodlet Cottage and to the east is DeLauret Cottage. To the north of the House site are the Farm silos and some remaining sheds which housed the dairy, laundry and truck shed. It has been assessed as being in poor condition. At the time of heritage listing, the windows were boarded up and the building was unoccupied. The building is said to be structurally sound but run down and showing signs of having been vandalised. While the buildings are generally in poor condition, they have not been subject to significant alteration and are therefore of high historical integrity. The site, including both structures and grounds, still clearly conveys its history as part of a government welfare institution.  Heritage listing  Challoner Cottage, Mittagong Farm Home, dating from 1941, is of state social significance to many of the 30,000 or so children who lived at the Mittagong Farm Home between the 1880s and 1990s, one of the longest- running children's home in NSW. Many former child residents, including some of the Aboriginal stolen generation, have deeply emotional connections to Challoner Cottage because of their good and bad childhood experiences at the farm. Challoner Cottage is of state significance as a representative example of an institutional style of accommodation for children that contrasts with nearby \\"cottage-style\\" accommodation. It is representative of 1940s government child welfare philosophy and the architectural design practice of the Government Architect's Branch. Challoner Cottage is also of state historical significance for being a substantial institutional building built in part by its own children residents. If it is substantiated that it is constructed from materials produced on-site at the Mittagong Farm Home by the children themselves, Challoner Cottage provides physical evidence of the 20th century government policy of encouraging self sufficiency in its child state wards. Challoner Cottage is of local significance for its associations with the NSW State Children's Relief Board as the first children's home established and longest managed by the board. The size of the building and landscaped setting of Challoner Cottage landscaped also gives it local landmark qualities. Challoner Cottage, Mittagong Farm Home was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 28 March 2014 having satisfied the following criteria: The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Challoner Cottage, dating from 1941, is of state historical significance as a key element in the chronological development of a major state-run child welfare institution, Mittagong Farm Home demonstrating a change from cottage-style accommodation to institutional- scale dormitory-style accommodation. It has been estimated that 30,000 children lived at the institution between the mid 1880s and the mid 1990s. Challoner Cottage also has historical significance if it is substantiated that it was constructed in part by the children who would live there as wards of the state. It has been said that bricks, timber and other materials used in the building were produced at the Mittagong Farm Home by the children themselves. Challoner Cottage would then provide physical evidence of the 20th century government policies of encouraging self sufficiency in children wards of the state. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Challoner Cottage, along with the other surviving cottages from the former Mittagong Farm Home, is of local significance for its association with the NSW State Children's Relief Board. The Mittagong Farm Home was the first children's home and welfare centre established and managed by the board, and it has close historical associations with the first three presidents of the board, Sir Arthur Renwick, Sir Charles Mackellar and Alfred William Green. Challoner Cottage also has some local significance for its historical association with the Government Architect's Branch, which was responsible for its design. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Challoner Cottage is of local aesthetic significance for its demonstration of a modernist architectural design approach to the accommodation of institutionalised children in the mid twentieth century, in contrast to the older and more \\"homey\\" cottage style accommodation used in adjacent buildings at the former Mittagong Farm Home. Because of its size and unusual architectural style, the building and its landscaped setting has landmark qualities. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Challoner Cottage is of state social significance to many of the former children who resided the Mittagong Farm Home between the 1940s and the 1990s. Evidence of this community attachment for the building can be seen in the level of support for its retention as well as the strength of patronage for the annual reunions and open days held by the Renwick Association. Many former child residents, including some of the Aboriginal stolen generation, have deeply emotional connections to Challoner Cottage because of their childhood experiences at Mittagong Farm Home. This significance may be enhanced if it is proved that the Challoner Cottage building itself was constructed in part from bricks, timber and other materials produced and processed at the Mittagong Farm Home by the children themselves as part of their training in trades. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Challoner Cottage is understood to be of low archaeological potential. No structures are known to have been present on the site prior to the construction of Challoner Cottage in 1941 and both Challoner Cottage and the shelter shed have concrete floors and domestic archaeological deposits would not occur beneath either structure. An Aboriginal archaeological survey of the former Mittagong Farm HomeNavin Officer, 2002 did not discover any traditional Aboriginal relics within the curtilage of Challoner House. There is research potential to enhance our understanding of the place and the experience of children wards of the state that could be obtained through oral history interviews with former residents and staff, and through documentary research using the annual reports of the successive welfare departments which were responsible for the site during its history. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Challoner Cottage is of local significance for its rarity as the only institutional-style building built in the mid-twentieth century at Mittagong Farm Home, and as such provides physical evidence of the change in policy from providing domestic-scale cottage accommodation to larger, dormitory-style accommodation after the introduction of the Child Welfare Act of 1939. It was the only new building constructed at Mittagong Farm Home for accommodating children between 1915 and 1969. A comparative analysis of surviving architecture of children's homes across the state may indicate that Challoner Cottage is rare at a state level. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Challoner Cottage is of state significance as a representative example of purpose-built children's home accommodation from the 1940s which demonstrates an institutional style of accommodation that was less intimate in scale than adjacent \\"cottage-style\\" accommodation. It is a representative 1940s expression of government child welfare philosophy and of the architectural design practice of the Government Architect's Branch.

Paavo Ilmari Ravila (5 July 1902 ‚Äì 16 April 1974) was a Finnish linguist and rector of the University of Helsinki.  Biography  Ravila started his studies at the University of Turku in 1921, the same year the university was founded. He received his master's degree in philosophy 1924 and continued his education in Finno-Ugric languages at the University of Helsinki under professors Yrj√∂ Wichmann, Frans √Ñim√§ and J. J. Mikkola. He earned his PhD in 1932 and was professor of Finnish and related languages at the University of Turku from 1934 to 1949. He spent the rest of his career at the University of Helsinki, first as professor of Finno-Ugric linguistics from 1949 to 1956, then as rector from 1953 to 1956 and finally as chancellor from 1963 to 1968. He lectured at the Indiana University Bloomington in 1951 and at Columbia University 1962‚Äì1963. During his stay at Indiana University, he took iniative to establishing a permanent chair for Finnish studies.  Work  Ravila's interests included the languages of the Mordvins and the Sami people; his doctoral dissertation, Das Quantit√§tssystem des seelappischen Dialektes von Mattivuono (1932), was based on material he collected on expeditions in the 1930s. He was also interested in general linguistics, methodology and language philosophy, and published a well-received introduction to language history, Johdatus kielihistoriaan (1946). He was among the few scholars in Finland between 1940 and 1965 who were interested in the international development of theoretical linguistics, and he presented the new ideas, such as the proto-language concept and transformational syntax, to Finnish audience. He took a skeptical stance towards some of the new developments, especially transformational generative grammar. In 1966, he published Finnish Literary Reader, a selection of prosaic and lyrical texts by representative Finnish authors. As a university administrator, Ravila had significant influence on Finnish research and university policy in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1958, in a speech to the Finno-Ugrian Society, he suggested establishing a professorship in general linguistics at the University of Helsinki, which became a reality in 1966.  Honors and memberships  Ravila was elected member of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters in 1944 and of the Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters in 1955. He was appointed corresponding member of the Learned Estonian Society in 1938 and foreign member of the Royal Gustavus Adolphus Academy in 1956. He was a member of the Academy of Finland from 1956 to 1963, when he was appointed its president. He was also president of the Finno-Ugrian Society for 14 years.

It first aired on July 4, 2018 on Cartoon Network. It was directed by Joe Johnston and Liz Artinian and written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster and Jeff Liu. The episode attracted media attention after it aired because it featured the first same-sex marriage proposal in Western children's animation. The episode aired as the third episode of a \\"Stevenbomb\\", a sequence of five episodes that aired one each day from July 2 to July 6, 2018. In the first episode of the week, \\"Now We're Only Falling Apart\\", Ruby and Sapphire's relationship is strained by the revelation that Steven's mother, Rose Quartz, was originally the despot Pink Diamond. In this episode, the two reconcile as Ruby proposes marriage to Sapphire. The wedding itself takes place in the week's fifth episode, \\"Reunited\\". Plot Steven (Zach Callison) and Amethyst (Michaela Dietz), searching for Ruby (Charlyne Yi), find her eating pizza and reading comic books with Steven's father, Greg (Tom Scharpling). Ruby tells Steven that her current separation from Sapphire is the first time she's really been on her own, free to choose her own path. Steven is distressed that this means Ruby and Sapphire may never fuse back into Garnet, but Greg reminds him that Ruby must make her own decisions about her relationships. Inspired by a western comic book, Ruby decides to become a lonesome cowboy, \\"one with the wilderness... not needing nothing from nobody\\". Amethyst shapeshifts into a horse to help her play the part. Accompanied by Amethyst, Steven, and Greg, Ruby spends the day exploring the open plain, relishing the opportunity to make her own decisions, regardless of how dangerous they are. She sings the song \\"Ruby Rider\\", a country song celebrating life on her own. That night, Steven apologizes to Ruby for pressuring her to return to Sapphire. But Ruby confesses that, as much as she is enjoying the cowboy adventure, she deeply misses Sapphire and is frustrated by her loneliness. Steven convinces Ruby that making her own choices doesn't mean that she and Sapphire need to be separate, but Ruby decides that this time they need to find a way to be together by their own choice, and not for Rose Quartz's sake. Steven, getting an idea, shows Ruby the last page from the western comic, to which she reacts enthusiastically. When Steven, Amethyst and Ruby return to Steven's house the following morning, Steven sends Sapphire (Erica Luttrell) out to meet Ruby waiting for her on the beach. Sapphire runs down and apologizes to her for doubting their relationship. But Ruby tells her, \\"Someone else told us we were the answer, but I don't believe that anymore.... At least not until I hear it from you.\\" Kneeling before her, Ruby asks Sapphire to marry her, explaining, \\"This time, being Garnet will be our decision.\\" Sapphire happily accepts and the two embrace and dance on the beach. The last shot of the episode is the last page of the western comic, depicting the cowboy protagonist marrying his lover. Production and music The episode was written and storyboarded by Miki Brewster and Jeff Liu. Liz Artinian was the art director, with Joe Johnston as supervising director. Series creator Rebecca Sugar described the plotline involving Ruby and Sapphire's engagement as \\"years in the making\\"; she told Entertainment Weekly that \\"years of tireless work... [led] up to this moment,\\" stressing the importance of \\"tell[ing] LGBTQ+ children that they belong in this world and they deserve to be loved.\\" This episode features the song \\"Ruby Rider\\", sung by Charlyne Yi as Ruby. The song was composed by Jeff Liu and Stemage, with lyrics by Liu, and was released digitally as a single alongside the episode's broadcast. Broadcast and reception =Viewership= \\"The Question\\" premiered July 4, 2018 on Cartoon Network. Its initial broadcast received a Nielsen household rating of 0.15, meaning that it was seen by 0.15% of all households.http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys- top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-7-4-2018.html =Critical reception= The episode was favorably reviewed by critics. Eric Thurm, writing for The A.V. Club, gave the episode a rating of B+. He especially praised Yi's performance of \\"Ruby Rider\\", and wrote that the episode does a good job of exploring the previously underdeveloped character of Ruby, justifying why she might need some time apart from Sapphire, and handling the \\"nuanced and emotional\\" character arc. He said that the resolution of Ruby deciding to return to Sapphire after all felt like \\"a bit of a cop-out\\" in not exploring the longer-term effects of a breakup, but Ruby's proposal to Sapphire was \\"sweet and thrilling\\". Vrai Kaiser, writing for The Mary Sue, also praised Yi's singing, and her performance of \\"new and subtler shades of Ruby‚Äôs character\\". Kaiser also noted parallels between \\"The Question\\" and the earlier episode \\"The Answer\\", which depicted the beginning of Ruby and Sapphire's relationship; and praised the episode's artwork and its normalization of queer relationships. According to Teen Vogue, Ruby's proposal was enthusiastically received by fans, with many sharing their excitement on social media. The episode attracted media attention for purportedly featuring the first same-sex marriage proposal in Western animation. Petrana Radulovic, writing for Polygon, described it as \\"a pivotal moment in... inclusive messaging in pop entertainment\\" and \\"a defining moment both within the show and in animated television at large.\\" Entertainment Weekly noted that the episode was one of many instances of Steven Universe \\"supporting more inclusive storytelling\\", including featuring queer relationships at a time when they are still rare in animated series.

This tactic is common in other countries such as Myanmar and India, as indicated by an opinion piece about British political parties. Unlike Myanmar and India, Islamophobia in Israel often takes the form of spreading Islamophobia in other countries. This includes abusing power by justifying the harassment of Palestinians within territories under Israel's control, as well as supporting aggression towards Muslim people. This strategy has become less frequent over time, due to multiple agreements and treaties. Islamophobia within Israel is considered an issue of social injustice. Lobbyists in Israel have often given support to many of the tactics employed by the government. Many groups such as the Carter Center condemn Islamophobia and its many forms. These groups support advocates for peace and justice in Palestine. In order to counter these measures, the government often applies allegedly racist and McCarthyist campaigns and tactics. International Organizations Israel has been claimed by left-wing activists to employ six major organizations to promote Islamphobia. These organizations form a network which has the purpose of promoting Islamophobia, and are called sayanim in the Hebrew language, which means helpers or assistants. Most of these organizations are Zionists, and are claimed to have powerful positions in American society from which they can execute powerful campaigns and tactics, especially when they work together. For example, journalists can work with lobbyists and others to promote information or analysis that are useful to Israel. For many years, there was an apparent connection between sayanim and the Mossad. According to a 2010 report from the Reut Institute, the organizations that are claimed to be involved in coordinating these tactics had responsibility transferred to the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairshttp://reut- institute.org/data/uploads/PDFVer/20100310%20Delegitimacy%20Eng.pdf page number?. The sayanim try to inform the public by using any kind of media to \\"help shape public opinion\\". Forming and organizing propaganda in other countries was considered a responsibility of Ministry of Strategic Affairs. Larudee claimed, in a self-described radical newsletter, that \\"A successful program of Islamophobia campaigns helps to support Israel‚Äôs programs of mistreatment of Palestinians in Gaza, its settlements in and economic strangulation of the West Bank, its invasions of Lebanon, its attacks against Syria, and its promotion of US wars against Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Libya and Syria\\". =Budget= IJAN reports that three hundred million dollars were allotted to propaganda and surveillance in order to support these campaigns by 2015. IJAN wrote that there are seven major intermediaries that prepare financial needs to promote Islamophobic thoughts and anti-Palestinian hostility. The connection between Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian racism have become more obvious and interconnected. American role Many Islamophobic beliefs center around the attacks of 11 September 2001. American Zionist groups (both Jewish and Christian) , used this as a tool to spread their Islamophobic beliefs to the public. According to the reports from the Center for American Progress, Israel's role in the spread of these beliefs have been successful due to support from many different groups. Supporters of Islamophobia have given $11 million to Israel-related causes. =Education= Graffiti in Israel about Islam Israel lobbyists and politicians have made an effort to destructively influence academics and campus advocates. On April 6, 2018, as The Forward was nominated to support anti-Muslim campaigns, the U.S. Jewish leader Ronald Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, gave $1.1 million to secure The United States of America at this time. =Advertisement= If it is said that a person is \\"pro-Israel\\", he has to establish peace between Israel and its neighbors. This peace process has been considered more than simply a matter of international relations; it is the internal identities of Israel and its many neighbors. The prospects of peace are damaged by false dichotomies in the complicated region, although there is seen many ambiguities in the peace process. False dichotomies can be made by the ideology of Islamophobia promoted in New York City subways. They create false dichotomies to decrease peace by such as the saying, \\"In any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel.

According to Alibi (a Finnish crime magazine), he is the only Finn that fits FBI's description of a serial killer. Despite his danger, Lindholm has repeatedly been released, albeit with the risk of a new death, and has been the subject of much criticism from people for the over-lax functioning of the Finnish legal system.Ilta-Sanomat: Miksi sarjakuristaja sai kulkea vapaalla jalalla?

He wore black leather gloves during the attack. The girl managed to escape, and despite the 16-year-old Lindholm receiving no fines, earlier thefts and attacks led him to the Kerava Youth Facility in 1984. He was released in 1985.  The first murders  Lindholm killed his mother, 48-year-old barmaid Laina Lahja Orvokki Lindholm in their apartment in Oulu on August 26, 1985. Both Lindholm and his mother's male friend were suspected in the murder - the crime was, however, initially ignored.Pohjolan poliisi kertoo 1995: Er√§√§n kuristajan kuva (Suomen poliisin urheiluliitto ry, 1995) The next murder Lindholm committed was on July 26, 1986. He met two 12-year-old girls down town and persuaded them to \\"come to his apartment so he could lend them a few marks for alcohol\\". Within his residence in Oulu, he locked one of the girls in the bathroom. The other girl, Titta Marjaana Kotaniemi, was knocked down on the floor and was choked to death.: Suomalainen murha 1953-1990 (Helsinki: Eurooppalainen kustannustalo, 1991) After some time, Lindholm released the other girl from the bathroom and sexually assaulted her. The girl escaped his grasp and ran from the apartment to the stairway, while Lindholm fled to the nearby forest where the police soon caught him. He was drunk, with 1.75 on the BAC scale. In connection with the murder of Kotaniemi, Lindholm confessed to the police that he was mistreated by his mother. According to his statement, he had worn the blue leather gloves and the red-coloured scarf of his mother before doing so. He was angered by the fact that his mother had not been able to release him from youth facility and that she had been dating a new man, preferring to live with him rather than his father. Later, in the Oulu court, he recanted his confession and claimed he had been using multiple psychoactive drugs at once. The Oulu District Court issued its judgment on March 17, 1987. The court ruled that Jukka Lindholm had been guilty of two charges of manslaughter as well as other crimes, condemning him for 9 years and 7 months imprisonment. However, the Rovaniemi Appellate Court held the case Laina Lindholm's death was not a murder and instead an assault or negligent homicide, and reduced the sentence to 7 years imprisonment.  Third murder  Lindholm was granted parole in May 1992.Pohjolan poliisi kertoo 1995: Er√§√§n kuristajan kuva (Suomen poliisin urheiluliitto ry, 1995) On May 31, 1993, he choked a 42-year-old woman with a cloth belt in her Kempele apartment. Lindholm at first objected sharply to the act, claiming that somebody had set him up. On June 23, 1993, he escaped from the Oulu County Police Station with another man. The Oulu District Court considered Lindholm to be completely sane, and sentenced him to 9.5 years imprisonment on December 13, 1993. Following the judgment of the District Court, Lindholm contacted the investigators. He admitted to having killed the woman, but it was on accident. According to him, he had proposed explicit sex and explained that he was playing around the neck before realising that she had died due to choking. Lindholm had wandered off to his mother's grave after the murder, staying there for a few hours. The Appellate Court subsequently changed the sentence to 10.5 years, sending Lindholm to a special institution. According to psychiatric reports, Lindholm admired the primordial, violent manhood of his teenage years - despite starting to wear dresses and women's underwear while in prison. The head of the H√§meenlinna Center forbade this, and Lindholm subsequently complained to the Parliament's ombudsman.  Freedom and new troubles  Lindholm was released on parole in November 2008. Prior to his release, he was subjected to treatment, which came to a conclusion that he was not yet ready for civilian life. In prison, he married Hannele Pentholm, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for her husband's murder. They were married for a couple of years. Since then, he renamed himself to Michael Maria Pentholm, who invited a woman to his house in May 2009. There, he tried to choke the woman with both his hands from behind. In August 2009, Pentholm bought an Oulu apartment in Toppila via a professional jury magazine announcement. He began to choke a woman while erecting a massage table in the apartment's living room. A third such case occurred in September 2009: Pentholm had ordered a cleaner for his apartment and began to choke her, but she managed to escape and immediately alert the police. On June 11, 2010, the Oulu District Court sentenced Pentholm to six years' imprisonment for three attempted manslaughters and numerous assaults. Authorities ordered Pentholm to sit through his whole sentence because, according to a mental study, he was regarded as a very dangerous offender. In April 2011, the Rovaniemi Appellate Court considered Pentholm to have committed only three aggravated assaults, lowering the sentence to 4 years and 5 months. At the same time, the Appellate Court ruled that the prerequisites for ordering Pentholm to sit out his punishment as a whole in jail did not exist. On March 2, 2012, the Oulu District Court condemned Pentholm for 4 years and 4 months for serious rape, gross ill-treatment and false imprisonment. The cruel rape and false imprisonment had taken place on August 21-22, 2009 at a hotel in Oulu, and the assault in a company in the period from May 1-31, 2009 in Pentholm's Oulu apartment in Myllyoja. The authorities ordered Pentholm to execute his full sentence in jail, and the Appellate Court upheld the verdict in October 2012. On Tuesday, October 13, 2015, the now renamed Michael Penttil√§ escaped from Laukaa's open prison during a prisoner shopping trip, but was caught the following day. He was granted parole in the spring of 2016. Penttil√§'s jail sentence was prolonged due to the absences and the entire term of his sentence was changed to imprisonment in a closed prison. Penttil√§ was released in 2016 on Christmas. In April 2017, the police ordered for Penttil√§ to be arrested again for alleged aggravated crime and the preparation of a criminal offense, but the Helsinki District Court released him during the investigation. In May 2017, the Helsinki Appellate Court annulled the decision and Penttil√§ was rearrested. On July 7, 2017, the Helsinki District Court dismissed the prosecution of an aggravated criminal offense or a health offense and ordered Penttil√§ to be released. In May 2018, the Appellate Court changed the decision and Penttil√§ was sentenced to 2 years and 6 months imprisonment, and to pay the victim a compensation of 4,000 euros. On April 13, 2018, Penttil√§ killed a prostitute in a Helsinki apartment. The victim was found on May 4 and Penttil√§ was arrested two days later in Helsinki, suspected of murder. On May 17, 2018 the police announced that Penttil√§ had admitted during interrogations that he had committed a homicide. In July, the Helsinki District Court sentenced him to life imprisonment for murder. He had held steady discretion in the murders, using several tools such as leather belts, tights or his bare hands. Penttil√§ later announced that he would appeal the court's decision.

It is operated by Scott County Schools (SCS), which oversees all public K‚Äì12 education in Scott County, Kentucky. The school bears the name of the former Great Crossing School, which opened in 1939 and was in turn named for one of the Georgetown area's first settlements, established at a buffalo crossing of Elkhorn Creek. The original Great Crossing School housed a high school program until the county's high schools were consolidated into Scott County High School, also in Georgetown, in 1955. The building continued to serve as a school until Western Elementary School opened in 1993, and now houses the SCS central office. SCS had planned to build a new high school in the 1990s, but never followed through on those plans until the last half of the 2010s. By that time, overcrowding at Scott County High, the only public high school in the county, had reached crisis proportions. During the last half of the 2010s, Scott County was the fastest- growing county in Kentucky, and was projected to have more than 3,000 high school students by the 2020‚Äì21 school year. With this in mind, the school district approved construction of the new school, breaking ground in 2017. It is located about 1 mile (1.6 km) away from Scott County High and also adjacent to Elkhorn Crossing School, previously a detached campus of Scott County High. The school cost about $90 million, and opened before it was 100% complete; the only parts yet to be completed were a welding classroom and a performing arts auditorium. Construction was plagued by unusually wet weather, with 247 rain days during the project. The new school was built with space for over 1,900 students, but opened with about 1,450. Initially, SCS announced that all rising juniors and seniors for 2019‚Äì20 at Scott County High could remain at that school if they wished. Additionally, any siblings of these students who were set to attend an SCS high school would also be allowed to attend Scott County High. SCS later changed the plan to allow all students who were set to attend high school in the district to choose which school they would attend, and about 55% chose Great Crossing.

It was built from 1868 to 1869. It is also known as Golden Valley. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Golden Vale was originally called Golden Valley by ex-convict Thomas Wilmott when he was granted the land in 1842, a short distance from the west bank of the Medway Rivulet and below the western slopes of Mount Gingenbullen. After receiving his ticket-of-leave in 1822, Wilmott amassed some wealth and was a successful innkeeper in the Berrima district. He also became owner of several properties besides Golden Valley. It was subsequently purchased by Edward Carter, who had inherited substantial landholdings at Emu Creek from his father, Benjamin Carter in 1857. Edward Carter acquired further holdings, and by 1880 would also own the Bangadilly, Burganglo, Evandale, Joadja, Nandi, The Gap, Tugalong and Golden Vale estates. He also discovered kerosene shale in the Joadja Valley and began mining it 1873, selling out in 1878. Edward Carter built the present Golden Vale homestead late 1860s to accommodate his wife and family. His youngest son was born there in 1870. The Golden Valley property was known for its annual kangaroo hunt which lasted for several days. A newspaper report in 1871 described a kangaroo hunt here: \\"The annual hunt at Nandi came of fon tuesday, wednesday and thursday last with the greatest success...Edward Carter Esq. of Golden Vale, Sutton, on whose estate this established annual meeting takes place. Thirty-two huntsmen, forty four dogs and forty-eight horses comprised the equipment and the grand total killed in the two and a half days was 76 kangaroos and 15 joeys\\". The Carter family had become important leaders in the district by the time Golden Valley homestead was built. In 1879 Alfred, Edward's eldest son, left Golden Vale and moved to the property Lake Edward at Crookwell. Edward and his sons ran sheep and cattle and bred some very fine horses at the Crookwell and Sutton Forest properties over the following years. By 1898 Alfred had married and managed all the family properties. Edward Carter died in 1903 and was buried at All Saints Church in Sutton Forest. He had seen his family fortune increase over the years and was able to leave each son a sizeable holding. In 1904 Alfred returned to live at Golden Valley with his wife and small son, Walter. Alfred died in 1922 and Walter left Golden Vale five years later to return to his original home at Crookwell. In 1939 Golden Valley was sold to Sir Phillip Goldfinch who retained the property until his death in 1943. In 1943 Frank Keighley, of \\"Myddelton\\" (Mt.Eymard) in Bowral, purchased Golden Valley from the executors of the Goldfinch estate. This property remained in the Keighley family until 2004. Geoffrey Keighley, international cricketer and later member of the Parliament of New South Wales, bought 400 acres of the farm from his uncle, which he added to, before inheriting the remainder of the land on the uncle's death. Keighley restored the house and filled it with an extensive library. Following an earthquake in 1961, the building underwent repairs and the chimneys were replaced with concrete covers. The kitchen and wet areas were modernised during the twentieth century, with various details also changed (e.g. the loss of shutters). In 1984, Geoffrey Keighley requested that the Heritage Council place a heritage order over the property. Keighley was opposing the establishment of a hard rock mine on nearby Mount Gingenbullen, to Golden Vale's immediate north, at the time of his request. One concern was the potential for the impact of blasting to crack the sandstone of Golden Vale's buildings. The house, kitchen block and laundry/dairy block were restored in 1984 or 1985. The Italian loggia, swimming pool and conservatory were added at this time. The sandstone courtyard was enclosed as a three-sided courtyard by the construction of a sandstone garage on former open space at the rear of the house. The verandah was rebuilt and enclosed along the north wall, and the northern wing was connected to the main homestead by a north-facing conservatory. In 1990 it comprised 560 hectares and was still run as a cattle enterprise with some sheep. In 2004, Geoffrey and Karin Keighley gifted the property to the National Trust of Australia, a few months before Geoffrey's death. Karin Keighley continued to live in the property, with her and a manager looking after the day-to-day care of the property and homestead. On 23 June 2007, the National Trust auctioned 95 of the 300 acres of Golden Vale gifted to them, with the money raised to go into an endowment fund to preserve the homestead and garden. The property was not open to the public as of 2018.  Description  The homestead group at the farm's core consists of: * homestead - built late 1860s; * stone meathouse; * original, sandstone two- storey barn/stables; * weatherboard woolshed; * several machinery sheds; * a double garage; * a single garage; and * carriage house. =Homestead= Golden Vale is a fine two storey sandstone Georgian house facing south-east with a steep iron roof with two chimneys. The house follows the Georgian (Revival) tradition with a symmetrical disposition of its shuttered French doors on the ground floor and twelve-paned windows on the first floor. The lower storey has a substantial verandah across the front which returns half way along either side of the house, supported on timber columns. Very fine red cedar joinery throughout the house is of good quality, most of which is intact. Internally the arrangement of rooms is not quite so formal. In two rooms corner fireplaces are used. In the front room on the right of the 7'6\\" (2.3m) wide hall, there is a corner fireplace with a black marble mantlepiece. Strangely, the wall on one side of the fireplace has been opened into the next space by a large flattened arch. A similar arch is used to articulate the hall. The original colour scheme and friezes were discovered by the builder but have not been followed in repainting. Original floor boards exist in the dining room and rare cedar woodwork and doors are throughout. The building boasts an entry hall, music room, library, drawing room and dining room each of which have beautiful French windows and solid fuel fireplaces. It also features a marble fireplace, slate fireplace, cedar fireplaces, and a cedar staircase. There are three large bedrooms on the first floor, the main bedroom having the addition of a dressing room and bathroom. At the rear an enclosed court is formed by the kitchen wings. At the rear of the homestead, a courtyard is formed by the 24' (7.3m) long kitchen block and the wing which contains the meat room and laundry. All three buildings are in sandstone. The sandstone kitchen block is a separate building accessed by the conservatory. The former servants' room is now the laundry/pantry/meat room block and there is an adjoining meat room. The additions are generally reasonably sympathetic in manner and have been undertaken in order to make the house comfortable as a 'gentleman's residence'. The single storey verandah across the front and two sides has been continued along the rear (north) wall to give shelter to the kitchen courtyard, and on the east side, the verandah has been extended and enclosed to provide a breakfast room and sheltered access to the kitchen wing. The interior of the kitchen wing has been extensively refurbished and a new double garage has been built on the north side of the courtyard in a style and materials mimicking the laundry/meathouse next to it. Other homestead group elements include: * stone footings to the southwest of the stone woolshed (possibly from earlier, 1856 house?), and * a driveway passing to the rear (western side) of the house. (The site gives no indication that the house has ever been accessible from the front; there seems to be no other alignment for the drive than the present one which passes the rear of the house and ends at the stone footings near the woolshed to the house's north); * an inner protected courtyard formed by the homestead and the meathouse extended by the addition of new rendered * walls creating an enclosed walled garden at the side of the house with a newly planted garden within.; * a couple of weatherboard cottages; * a stone stables/coach house with a more modern weatherboard shearing shed attached on one side. It is possible that the stables/coach house is older than the main house; * older picket fences on the north and west of the garden have been replaced by high, stone-capped concrete block walls. =Farm= The property nestles between Oldbury and Newbury farms at the foot of Mt Gingenbullen (to its south-south-west) near the Medway Rivulet. It is cleared and grazed Southern Tableland country, surrounded by rural properties. The farm is treed and dammed. =Garden and grounds= The attractive gardens surrounding the homestead have been created in the English style by Karin Keighley. The plants are primarily deciduous trees and shrubs and feature in springtime with drifts of bulbs. Another point of interest is the collection of parrots displayed in aviaries. High stone walls protect part of the garden from the weather. Outside these walls a long, tree lined driveway leads up to the front gates on the Golden Vale Road. The driveway is lined with Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) interplanted with golden ash (Fraxinus excelsior 'Aurea') trees, is long and straight, curving west around the house, where a greater density of hedges and fences form yards and paddocks at the farm's core. The service yard behind (west of) the house is gravelled and edged by outbuildings. A single gated entry to the rear of the house leads between outbuildings to it. Other gates are further north on the house's north-western side; around and further along the house garden's northern boundary. Older picket fences on the north and west of the garden have been replaced by high, stone-capped concrete block walls. There is also: * a large Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) located in the centre of the driveway turning circle at the rear of the house; * some young Quercus robur (European oak trees) planted from acorns reputedly collected in Hyde Park, London. The oldest mature trees in the garden appear to be a Bhutan cypress (Cupressus torulosa) immediately south-west of the house which shades its small back yard, two or three large old \\"English\\" oaks (Quercus robur) in the garden's eastern end, one on the north and southern borders, and two large pin oaks (Quercus palustris) to the north of the swimming pool. A sweep of lawn runs from the front verandah east and down a slight slope to a swimming pool and pavilion with a colonnade around it. Borders of banks of shrubs and trees flank both sides of this. An open lawn area south of the house runs around to its south-western side where this becomes a small rear yard, flanked by outbuildings. At the garden's north-eastern corner is a hedge screening a fenced formal vegetable garden with a range of well-kept fruit such as currants, raspberries, strawberries in raised beds and open-ground beds of vegetables.  Heritage listing  The Golden Valley property is significant through its associations with the early settlement of the area and its connection with Benjamin Carter who discovered the Joadja Kerosene Shale deposits. The sandstone homestead, meathouse, barn/stables and woolshed are aesthetically significant because they are well sited within a valley at the base of Ginginbullen Mountain. They are a rare example within the region of such a combination of stone and timber buildings present in a pleasant setting. The group is also significant as a landmark within the important landscape setting of Mt Gingenbullen. Golden Vale is a two-storey sandstone house with a corrugated iron roof. The lower storey has a verandah across the front which returns halfway along either side of the house. The returns, reveals and front facades are careful masonry. The wall infill particularly at the rear is the work of labourers or apprentices. It is supported by timber columns. At the rear, an enclosed courtyard is formed by the kitchen wings. The cedar joinery throughout the house is of good quality. The house apparently expresses an unfulfilled design. The carefully executed front contrasts with the more utilitarian rear, but although the walled garden is modern there is no indication that the house has ever been accessible from the front. It is a distinguished and well built house. The original owner Benjamin Carter discovered Kerosene Shale in the Joadja Valley in 1852. By 1873 he was mining this valuable shale and later sold out to the Australian Kerosene Oil and Minerals Company. An elegant example of a late Georgian farmhouse. Golden Valley is a large property settled in 1856. Golden Vale was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

She was last seen in Koria before she vanished. A friend began worrying about Mets√§nikula when she failed to return to university. Her father traveled to Turku to look for her, but when no trace of her was found, she was declared missing. On August 17, 17-year-old Ritva Anneli Raijas (born November 27, 1953) and 16-year-old Pirjo Marjatta Laiho (born July 20, 1954) left Pit√§j√§nm√§ki to visit an aunt in Hyvink√§√§. When they did not arrive a few days later, they were also declared as missing. Their last known location was at the H√§meenlinna bridge near Keimola on August 14. A 28-year-old Helsinki auto mechanic was seen taking the girls from the bridge. His actions were reported during the 1971 European Athletics Championships in Helsinki, as having picked up the girls near an Esso station on the crossroad between Kaarela and Nurmij√§rvi. The man reportedly had met the girls at 21:51 and had been seen with them at the Esso station until 22:00, when he left without them. Other motorists had seen the girls later on between Helsinki and H√§meenlinna. According to these accounts, they had been seen in a red Citro√´n 2CV..  Discovery of the bodies  On August 18, a Helsinki family picking mushrooms in forest in Ing√• stumbled upon a body wrapped up in plastic wrap and covered with moss and lark. Next to it were neatly fitted eyeglasses and patent leather shoes. The police later notified the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), which started exploring the forest and the surrounding environment. It was determined that the cause of death was unnatural. Later, the victim's identity was confirmed as Mets√§nikula. Her camera, three rings and belt were missing. Mets√§nikula's body was found near a labor camp in Ing√•, where criminals were placed to work for the last stages of their sentences before release. The police screened the prisoners' fingerprints in case the killer was there. On August 20, police were called in to inspect lost goods at Seutula's old airport. They found a young woman's personal belongings, including a Kela card and an audio recorder. The goods were found to belong to Raijas and Laiho. The following day, a group of young men found the bodies of the remaining two girls covered with plastic wrap in Ridasj√§rvi village.  Investigation and capture  The plastic was important evidence since it had a serial number that was assumed to belong to the Citro√´n the girls were last seen riding in. Since the plastic was made in Sweden, five Swedish companies were contacted about the matter. However, it was eventually determined that the plastic had probably come through Finland with some electrical equipment and was not linked to any Swedish-registered automobile. The victims' shoes were tied neatly in lines, and at the time of the autopsy were in a smiling position. Ethanol was later found in their blood, and both had been sexually assaulted. The cause of death was determined as carbon monoxide poisoning. The NBI combined the investigation of the cases, as the girls' killings were very similar and close in proximity. All the victims had been abducted and their goods found in the Southern Finland Province. The NBI, for the first time in its history, received pictures of the victims, which were distributed from all around Southern Finland to filling stations and dance venues. On one of the photographs, there were fingerprints of a man who had been to the Ing√• labor camp. His car, a 1967 Dodge Dart, registration number BNL-99, was searched. According to anonymous tips, the Dodge had been seen several times at the locations of the abductions. On September 26, the police found and arrested the Dodge's owner, 41-year-old Ensio Kalevi Koivunen, in the town of Hanko. His car and his home were searched. Two illegal pistols, a woman's belt and a camera were found.  Interrogations  Koivunen repeatedly changed his story under questioning. He denied killing the girls or even meeting them. However, he had transported four women in the summer, denying they were the same girls. In one of the interviews, Koivunen admitted to having met Mets√§nikula at the shore of Myllylampi, and that they talked about her studies and personal life over coffee. He also noted that Mets√§nikula used a lot of medication. As they continued their journey, the girl suffered a respiratory attack, causing Koivunen to stop and flee from the car. After returning, he found Mets√§nikula was lying dead in the car's back seat. He later hid the girl's body in the Ing√• forest. Similarly, Koivunen denied knowing anything about Laiho and Raijas, but changed his story and claimed to have met Laiho earlier and began a relationship with her. According to him, Laiho proposed a meeting and brought along Raijas, whereupon the three headed for Hyvink√§√§. While they drank at a nightclub, an unnamed younger man joined them and Raijas began vomiting. Koivunen claimed that the girls were murdered outside of his presence and that the unnamed man had admitted to battering them to death. Koivunen's wife was also interviewed, and told police that Koivunen came home on the night of August 15 and told her that he had shown two girls and a boy around the city. When he and his wife read the magazine about the disappearance of Laiho and Raijas, Koivunen noted that they looked the same as the girls he had been with. Koivunen's story soon changed again, removing the unnamed young man from his story. This time he claimed that the girls had fallen asleep on the back seat while he was driving. Upon awakening, Koivunen noticed that the engine was running, and tried to wake the girls, unsuccessfully. Shuddering, Koivunen wandered around hoping the girls would wake up, but they were dead. In fear, he remembered what had happened to Mets√§nikula one month earlier. Koivunen feared to get sent back to jail and decided to get rid of the bodies. When the police asked how they had died, Koivunen told them that while they slept, someone had dug up the hose from the car's back and connected it through the exhaust pipe to the back of the car. However, the question arose of how Koivunen survived that. Koivunen never acknowledged his guilt and changed the details of the story many times, remaining consistent about a few details. According to his wife, they girls were scared, and had vomited and choked while in the car. When they heard that the police had found tire marks on the fringes, Koivunen's wife remembered her husband's strange and nervous behaviour on that night. During the investigation, a hair of Koivunen was found on Laiho and Raijas' bodies. The camera found at home was also identified as his, as well as fingerprints from a photo found in a back alley near his home. There were plenty of anonymous tips, some of which were significant. During a preliminary investigation, a girl told the police that she had hitchhiked from Helsinki to Hyvink√§√§. The driver was a 41-year-old male. At first everything seemed innocent until the man had decided to introduce the girl to the city. He had taken her, among other places, to the Taabor mountain, speaking about himself and his life on the way. When they got there, he did not let the girl out and threatened her, but she jumped out of the car and fled. After the incident, she had seen that same man near her house several times. When she was shown a picture of Koivunen, she immediately recognized him.  Trial  Koivunen was arrested for the murder of Mets√§nikula, Raijas and Laiho. He was jailed in the Helsinki Prison before the trial in the Hyvink√§√§ District Court, which got a lot of publicity. Koivunen was initially dissatisfied with his lawyer, and changed him before the trial. He tried to change his story and bring his own witnesses to the court, but nothing helped. The trial lasted six hours each day. Koivunen's criminal record was very long. He had been convicted of several property crimes, and from 1953 to 1968 he had been free only for a short time, and been incarcerated in a prison hospital eight times. He served a six year sentence in jail when he was involved in a car crash. All the crimes he had committed were done in Hyvink√§√§ and Ing√•, because they were located near the prison camp. Koivunen was ordered for a mental health examination. Koivunen was found to be sane, but in the process was identified as a habitual liar. The Hyvink√§√§ District Court ruled that Koivunen was guilty on all three charges of assault, false imprisonment and negligent homicide, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison. The release date is unknown. Koivunen died on May 27, 2003.

The South Australian company sold out in 1841 and the Hack brothers then became sole owners. They in turn found themselves in financial difficulties in the depression of the early 1840s and were declared insolvent in 1843. Hagan and Hart purchased the station, as well as another owned by the Hack brothers at Rosetta Head. They operated the Fishery Bay station for three or four months before closing it down. No further whaling seems to have occurred at the location after 1843. Archaeological investigations in the area have identified the remains of buildings and artifacts associated with the whaling station.

McMullen, known as Jack McMullen, (born December 10, 1941) is a Vermont businessman and political candidate. He is most notable for his unsuccessful runs for U.S. Senator in 1998, and again in 2004, as well as his unsuccessful candidacy for Vermont Attorney General in 2012. Early life Jack McMullen was born in Queens, New York on December 10, 1941, and raised on Staten Island. He graduated from Columbia University with a B.S. degree in Applied Physics and Electronics Engineering in 1964, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Military service McMullen served in the United States Navy from 1964 to 1969. Assigned to the staff of Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, the head of the Navy's nuclear submarine program, McMullen attained the rank of lieutenant as manager of a program that upgraded the service's nuclear-powered submarines with modernized reactors. He then pursued post-graduate education, and completed an MBA at Harvard Business School (with High Distinction) in 1972, and a J.D. from Harvard Law School (with Honors) in 1973. Early career McMullen was employed in management and consulting positions with several Boston-area companies and investment banks during the 1970s and 1980s, including Boston Consulting Group and Resource Planning Associates. He eventually founded his own consulting company, Cambridge Meridian Group, which provides strategic analysis and planning to corporate clients. McMullen also taught strategic planning and management, including time on the faculties at Harvard's business and law schools. From 1993 to 1997, McMullen served as an advisor to Senator Bill Bradley, and provided analysis and policy recommendations on issues including reducing crime in the United States and long-term management of the Social Security program. 1998 United States Senate race McMullen had maintained a vacation home in Warren, Vermont beginning in 1983, and he made Vermont his permanent residence beginning in 1997. In 1998, he declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator. As related by Chris Graff, longtime Vermont bureau chief for the Associated Press, McMullen's candidacy sustained an immediate blow when Graff interviewed retired Senator Robert Stafford about the January 1998 ice storm and other current events. During the discussion, Stafford persistently got McMullen's name wrong, calling him \\"Mulholland\\". Graff wrote that he tried to politely correct Stafford, but finally realized that Stafford's intent was to convey his opinion that McMullen was too unknown and too new to Vermont to be a viable candidate. The lede in the resulting story was that Vermont's senior Republican was of the view that McMullen hadn't lived in the state long enough to represent it in the senate, and Stafford's dismissal of McMullen as \\"Mulholland or whatever his name is\\" became a running joke among reporters and political operatives. In the Republican primary, McMullen faced Fred Tuttle, a retired dairy farmer who had starred in a mock documentary film called Man with a Plan, a comedy about a retired farmer who decides to run for Vermont's seat in the United States House of Representatives. Tuttle and filmmaker John O'Brien considered using a Tuttle candidacy to promote the film, and accepted a suggestion from political columnist Peter Freyne to challenge McMullen rather than incumbent Congressman Bernie Sanders. Tuttle then ran in the Republican U.S. Senate primary, partly to generate awareness of the movie, and partly to mock McMullen as a carpetbagger and flatlander (Vermont slang for an out-of-stater) who had moved to Vermont only because he thought it would be easier to run for the Senate there than in more populous Massachusetts. McMullen was slow to recognize that the Tuttle/O'Brien strategy was viable; when the McMullen campaign challenged Tuttle's nominating petitions as 23 short of the required 500 signatures, Tuttle turned in an additional 2,300. During a debate before the primary, Tuttle underscored McMullen's newness to Vermont. One question he posed to McMullen was \\"What's a tedder?\\" (A machine for drying hay.) Another was \\"What's rowen?\\" (The second cutting of hay from the same field in one season.) Tuttle continued with queries like \\"How many teats a Holstein got?\\" (Four; McMullen guessed six.) Tuttle then provided McMullen a list of local place names and asked him to pronounce them. McMullen's inexperience with Vermont geography showed, as he mispronounced names including Leicester (Lester is correct), Calais (callous being the correct way), and Charlotte (shar-LOT, not Shar-Lit). The campaign made national headlines, and added to Tuttle's semi-celebrity status. Despite McMullen spending over $500,000 to Tuttle's $200, on primary day, Tuttle beat McMullen 28,355 votes to 23,321 (55 percent to 45). Tuttle immediately announced his intention to vote for incumbent Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, after which the two made several joint appearances. On election day, Leahy defeated Tuttle and several minor candidates to win reelection. 2004 United States Senate race McMullen continued to reside in Vermont after his 1998 election defeat. In 2004, he won the Republican nomination to oppose Patrick Leahy, who was running for a sixth term. In November, Leahy won the general election with 71 percent of the vote to McMullen's 25, with the rest scattered among minor candidates. 2012 election for Vermont Attorney General In 2012, McMullen was the Republican nominee for Vermont Attorney General, and faced Democrat William Sorrell, the longtime incumbent, who was running for his eighth two-year term. Sorrell survived a close primary election against T. J. Donovan, and defeated McMullen in the general election with 58 percent of the vote to McMullen's 33, with the rest going to Progressive and Liberty Union candidates. Continued career McMullen continued his business career after moving to Vermont, and resided in Burlington. He served on the boards of directors for several corporations, including Lentigen Corporation, Ezenia! Inc., Opus Bio, Inc, and MRO Software Inc. In addition, he was involved in several civic and government activities, including: chairman of Governor Jim Douglas's Project to Advance Government Efficiency; member of the board of directors for the Vermont Council on Economic Education; board member for Associated Industries of Vermont; member of the board for the Greater Burlington Industrial Corporation; member of the Ethan Allen Institute board of directors; and pro bono work to assist Ruggles House, a senior citizen housing facility in Burlington.

He has established himself as a jewelry designer, gallery owner and collector. He has worked as a teacher in the arts education sector and as an author. Derrez was a founder and for six years a board member of the Dutch Association of jewelry designers and makers (\\"Vereniging van Edelsmeden en Sieraadontwerpers\\").  Life  Paul Derrez was born in Sittard, a small former mining town a short distance to the north of Maastricht in Limburg. His parents ran a jewelry shop in Sittard. He attended the Academy for Industrial Design in Eindhoven between 1968 and 1970, and the School of Arts (as it is now known) in Utrecht from 1970 till 1972. He then studied for his degree between 1972 and 1975 at the Vocational Academy (\\"Vakschool\\") at nearby Schoonhoven. The expectation had been that he would take over his family's business in Sittard. However, after an internship at the \\"Galerie Sieraad\\" (jewelry gallery) in Amsterdam he decided to settle permanently in that city. A crucial factor in this decision was his friendship with Willem Hoogstede. In 1975 he launched himself as a freelance gold/silversmith working in the basement in the house where he was living in the city centre. He produced several much admired silver pieces (\\"wisselring\\" & \\"wisselarmband\\"). In 1975 the Sieraad Gallery where he had been working closed down. It had been the first gallery in Amsterdam specialising in jewelry. A year later, in 1976, Derrez set up the Ra Gallery which in some ways took on the mantle of the Sieraad. The new gallery was named after the ancient Egyptian sun god. It provided a showcase for Dutch silversmiths and jewelry designers and, from 1978, also welcomed the work of international artists. In 1980 Derrez became the first winner of the (subsequently biennial) Fran√ßoise van den Bosch Prize for stimulating international interest in jewelry. The cash element of the prize was worth 4,000 Guilders. The 1980s were a decade of rapid internationalisation in the jewelry business. In 1984 Derrez was a co- organiser of the Australian \\"Cross Currents\\" exhibition, featuring pieces from Australia, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands. Several more exhibitions followed to which Derrez contributed as conservator or organiser. He started working with cork in 1985, producing necklaces as well as bowls and other utensils. In 1986 an exhibition was opened at Sittard using the jewelry collection of Paul Derrez and his friend Willem Hoogstede. It remained on display for ten years. Around 2000 he spent three months as artist in residence at the \\"Objects-studio\\" in Sydney, Australia. In 2005 he produced his \\"Condoommonstrans\\", wishing to present the piece at an exhibition in Legnica (Poland). However, the centrality of a condom in the design and the surrounding \\"halo of hearts and spermatozoids\\" made the design controversial, and he withdrew his design from the exhibition in order to \\"avoid a riot\\". The \\"Condoommonstrans\\" is now preserved in the \\"church-critical collection\\" at the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht. On 1 November 2015 an exhibition opened featuring approximately 100 Derrez pieces at the CODA (culture centre) in Apeldoorn in celebration of the artist's forty years as a designer and pioneer in the world of jewelry. Derrez was a board member of the Dutch Association of jewelry designers and makers (\\"Vereniging van Edelsmeden en Sieraadontwerpers\\") between 1976 and 1981, serving during the latter part of the part of that period as chairman. Between 1991 and 2000 he chaired the Fran√ßoise van den Bosch Foundation For some years, starting in 1995, he taught at the Arts Academy in Maastricht. In addition, from 2008 till 2010 he lectured at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam-Zuid.  Work  The early work of Derrez has a gender-neutral character. It is marked by clear shapes and the use of silver and acrylate. Midway through the 1990s his output acquired a homo-erotic character. The jewelry series \\"Risky business\\" includes references to leather straps.Liesbeth den Besten (1997) Paul Derrez, Cool Creator. Amsterdam: Galerie Ra. Derrez insists that jewelry should not always be harmonious: often it is more exciting when pieces also highlight discrepancies and rougher elements. When, in 1993, he was invited to make male jewelry for fashion shows, as a self-aware homosexual himself, he took inspiration from subcultures, fetishism and \\"adult toys\\". He himself likes to wear jewelry from his \\"Tools and Toys\\" series. For this series he used materials from the estate of Fran√ßoise van den Bosch and it is therefore sometimes referred to as his \\"aristocratic aluminium\\" (\\"adellijk aluminium\\") collection. During the present century the focus of his work has increasingly been on silverware: spoons, bowls, jugs and containers, occasionally with a humorous or provocative character, as in the case of his \\"Conversation bowl\\". In 2012 Derrez started applying so-called \\"confetti\\" on some of his jewelry and tableware. This involved applying dots of transparent acrylate, often tinted in bright or fluorescent colours.

It was the official country residence of the Governor of New South Wales from 1882 to 1957. The house had formerly been known as Prospect. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Land grants and Richardson ownership= In 1819 Governor Macquarie commissioned Dr. Charles Throsby to build the first road (Old South Road - now the Illawarra Highway) through the Southern Highlands district and land grants were made to encourage settlement. Early settlers included Benjamin Crew, Charles Wright and John Larkin (or Larkham) who each received 60 acres in 1822. Their grants of neighbouring lands at Sutton Forest were later to become the property of the Queen and the site of the Governor of New South Wales' country residence.Morton, 2013 The residence \\"Hillview\\" is situated on land granted in two portions of 60 acres by Governor Brisbane on 9 July 1822. These were portions 47 and 48 in the County of Argyle, District of Sutton, granted to Benjamin Crews, Charles Wright and John Larkham respectively. These properties were eventually owned by Richard Pemberton Richardson. He purchased portion 47 in 1866 but sold it back to the vendor, John Morrice, two years later. On 8 February 1872 Morrice resold a share of the property to Richardson who then gained sole rights to the land in 1875 after Morrice died. Richardson's wife purchased part of portion 48 in 1872, he was a trustee. On 17 December 1878 Richardson purchased the rest of portion 48. Richardson had come to NSW in 1850 from Liverpool in England, where his father had trained him to be a wool merchant. He joined Mort & Co., the prominent firm of auctioneers and wool brokers in Sydney, where he soon became a valued employee and was promoted in 1855 to land manager. His work brought him to the Sutton Forest district where he met and married Violet Alston of \\"Woodside\\", from a prosperous Moss Vale family. They lived in Sydney. At the end of 1857 he resigned from Mort & Co. and set up his own firm, soon building quite a reputation both for his integrity and the sound and efficient manner in which he handled his clients' affairs. In 1860 he took Edward Wrench as a partner. The firm began to specialise in stock and station sales with the emphasis on country estates. In 1866 Richardson acquired Crew's 60 acres and later bought Wright's and Larkham's acres. He called the property \\"Prospect\\" and built a house on portion 47, previously Crews'. It was named after his first residence in Australia, \\"Prospect Cottage\\" at Newtown. \\"Prospect\\" makes up part of the main house of \\"Hillview\\". The date of construction is most likely to date from somewhere between 1872 and 1875. It was a two-storey stone house with detached stables, built from stone quarried on the property. It consisted of three main rooms, three bedrooms, a hallway and rear attached kitchen where the stairs were located. The stairs led to a separate room upstairs. Richardson added a number of extensions in stone and timber prior to the sale to the Crown in 1882.Partridge & Davies, 1989 The garden was not developed until the house was erected (1872‚Äì75).Dixon, in Aitken & Looker, 2002, 304 So well did Richardson prosper that he retired from his firm in 1875 and took up residence at Prospect. By then the district had become a tourist destination because the Great Southern Railway from 1867 brought visitors attracted by the healthy climate of the highlands. Moss Vale grew into a busy town around its railway station (first called Sutton Forest North). However, Richardson soon found retirement at Prospect unsatisfying and decided to return to Richardson & Wrench. Richardson sold Prospect (143 acres) to the Government of New South Wales in 1881, returned to active business undertakings and built himself another country residence. =Official country residence= From the earliest days of the colony, the Governors had felt the need for a residence outside Sydney to which they could move for a change of air and relief from summer heat. Port Hacking was considered, being a seaside locale, but was a tedious trip by coach involving two river crossings. There had been pressure from a number of New South Wales Governors to purchase a country property for their use. Government House at Parramatta was used as an alternative country residence until Governor Fitzroy (1846‚Äì55). The Earl of Belmore (1868-72) and Sir Hercules Robinson (1872‚Äì79) leased residences in the Southern Highlands while in office. The Earl of Belmore was quick to realise the advantage that the just-opened railway line to Moss Vale provided in terms of access to the Southern Highlands area. Robinson often stayed privately in the highlands. When Lord Augustus Loftus was appointed in 1879 he immediately requested an alternative summer residence as he suffered from the salt air. Unable to find a suitable residence he suggested Government House at Parramatta. Loftus continued the pressure to purchase a residence but did not have the personal means to purchase a country house. This pressure was heightened in July 1881 when he was forced to extend his hospitality at Government House in Sydney to Prince Albert and Prince George who were visiting with the Royal Navy. The illness of Rear-Admiral Lord Clanwilliam for three weeks extended the visit of the fleet and the Princes continued their stay at Government House at additional cost to Lord Loftus. This proved to be a considerable financial strain for him and he wrote to Lord Kimberley in the Gladstone administration requesting action on the matter. As a result of this and previous agitation, the government purchased \\"Prospect\\" at Sutton Forest on 1 February 1882 out of a 100,000 pound Treasurer's advance account for expenses of an unforeseen nature. Parliamentary sanction was not sought at the time. However, the government changed and vigorous debate took place in March 1883 in which it was claimed that the purchase was unconstitutional and illegal. Meanwhile, government architect James Barnet was instructed in 1882 to propose plans for substantial additions to the house. In April that year the Under Secretary for Public Works gave his consent for the work to be carried out. This was to take place before October to allow for occupation during the summer season. Tenders were called and results reported on 23 May 1882. The tenders made were high and a recall was made. The prices were still high and Barnet recommended declining all tenders, demolishing the building and designing a new residence. Several schemes were proposed but do not seem to have taken place. Public Works reports for the years 1881-1883 show no expenditure on \\"Hillview\\", the records for 1884-1887 do not itemise expenditure and in 1888 and 1889 show just over 411 pounds spent on repairs and furniture. However, during 1884 the government acquired two land lots located next to \\"Hillview\\" from the Church of England. Negotiations for the purchase had begun when the government purchased \\"Hillview\\" but had been held up due to some problems, including the extent of land to be purchased. The house was extensively remodelled, with the staircases and other woodwork being done by William Barnsley of Sutton Forest. When completed in 1883 it had 46 rooms, including 9 bathrooms and over 3 acres of landscaped gardens with many trees and shrubs having been planted. The alterations cost the government 10,000 pounds - a mighty sum in those days, which caused furious debate in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Loftus probably first took up residence at 'Hillview in June 1884 or the following summer. The major period of extensions to the house appears to have been from 1890-1899. Further minor additions and alterations were carried out between 1900 and 1957. =Hillview's garden; and its impact on the district= A huge boost had come to the district when the NSW Governor, the Earl of Belmore decided in 1865 to lease Throsby Park, Moss Vale, as a summer residence, which he did until 1872. From 1870 onwards the tourist trade (in the Southern Highlands) grew, and by 1890 it was said that Bowral \\"held its own as a fashionable resort\\". The picturesque scenery aligned itself more with the idea of the English countryside than did the invigorative and sublime scenery of the Blue Mountains, which were not so \\"gentrified\\". By the mid-1880s the old elitism of the gentrified squattocracy was replaced by the ostentatious extravagance of those previously unaccustomed to wealth. Evidence of prosperity was never more important than in the High Victorian era of the 1880s. Wealthy landowners sought to outdo one another by including every possible urn, fountain or folly, so that by the end of the 1870s garden layouts were starting to display signs of the eclectic fashion of High Victorian taste, made possible by the horticultural and literary boom. The Treseder Brothers of Ashfield, Sydney and W. Adamson in Melbourne, however, continued the work of Thomas Shepherd and appealed for simplicity: \\"It is the common fault in designing of gardens to attempt too much, to introduce too many flower beds and walks and ornaments, to plant too largely and of kinds attaining too great a size - simplicity of garden design should always be kept in view, and it should be combined with a sufficient amount of intricacy to avoid plainness\\".Adamson, 1879 Hillview possessed the simple qualities espoused by the Treseders and Mr Adamson. Picturesque simplicity was associated with the English gentry; the Governor, whose country residence it was, was not compelled to display a lavish and pretentious garden, for his social standing was well recognised. In 1882 \\"The Illustrated Sydney News\\" described it as \\"on the summit of a hill, which overlooks the village, and hidden from sight by a clump of splendid pines, stands the summer residence of the Governor of NSW, commanding a splendid view to the north. It is no doubt greatly owing to this that Sutton Forest is alive and vigorous\\". The same article went on to say that the landscape \\"possesses no picturesque ravines nor thundery waterfalls to make it popular with the tourist.\\"Cavanough, Prell and North, 1988 The grounds were already \\"beautifully laid out\\" (1882) when Charles Moore superintended additional planting in keeping with their vice-regal status. Moore provided assistance in designing the garden, which had a simple and uncluttered layout. The main elements were a long serpentine driveway, rose garden and parkland opening out to magnificent views. Moore is likely to have designed the pine avenue lining the driveway which was planted by the Earl of Jersey in the 1890s, in order to harmonise with the predominantly Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) shelter that was well established on the western side of the garden. Previous to this the carriage way was treeless, defined only by a white post and rail fence shown in an etching in an 1882 edition of the Illustrated Sydney News. The major period of extensions to the house appears to have been from 1890-1899. Joseph Henry Maiden took over Charles Moore's position as Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens in 1896, after Moore's long term of 48 years. Maiden was not only responsible for the 40 acres of gardens in Sydney but also for the 763 acres of Centennial Park, 300 acres of the Governor's residence, Hillview at Sutton Forest, the State Nursery at Cambpelltown and sundry other establishments.Rost, 2012, 144 After Queen Victoria died in 1901 there was a change in fashion and the pines were removed in favour of elms (Ulmus procera, \\"English\\" elm). At this time the gate house stood at the western side of the entrance, which was marked by iron gates displaying the Royal cipher. The gate house was removed by Lord Wakehurst in 1938. =Government sale and Klein ownership= The Government decided to sell \\"Hillview\\" after the governorship of General Northcott in 1957. This decision has been attributed to the high cost of maintenance and the brief periods of occupancy. The property went to auction and was purchased by Edwin Klein in April 1958. Klein was born near Parkes NSW in 1901 and brought up on a small farm. He had made his money as a builder and land developer around Shellharbour on the NSW South Coast. He paid the ¬£35,000 asking price for Hillview in 1958 with the intention of \\"creating a peaceful retreat for retired senior citizens\\". Klein and his partner Walter Winley opened the \\"Emma Louise Hostel\\", Hillview in September 1958. However this project failed and the main house was for a time unoccupied, Klein living in an outbuilding that had been the quarters of the governor's aide-de-camp. Klein had reportedly not intended to live at \\"Hillview\\", but was so taken with its charm and uniqueness that he decided to use it as his residence. He set about improving the property, including landscaping, some painting and providing lookouts. Little was done to the fabric of the house or outbuildings. Klein never lived in the main house, preferring the small aide's wing. He was a well-read and largely self taught scholar and philosopher who thought that man's greatest assets were knowledge and wisdom but that intellectual/spiritual development of mankind had not kept pace with the scientific or technological advancement resulting in human discord. He longer for improved human relations on an international scale. It is believed that his obsession with these ideas and concept of \\"cultural minds wisely balanced in thought and action\\" was the principal reason for his creative endeavours in the garden at Hillview. He wanted to develop \\"a garden of the mind for beauty, performance and perception\\". In instigating these ideas, Klein set about \\"improving\\" the garden. He decided the grounds should be completely re- landscaped. All the unsightly fences were removed with a single skin of flat stones standing on their edges. He hardly altered the existing vice-regal garden, although he did remove 160 trees and shrubs which he considered to be insignificant, including a beautiful cypress hedge on the north-west side of the house. He furiously underplanted all that remained with camellias, azaleas, rhododendrons and oleanders and set out to create his \\"show garden\\" with rose beds and huge displays of dahlias - 500 varieties in every conceivable colour, shape and size 'new types being raised from the gardener's own seed'. In 1958, he extended the garden from 3.5 to 7 acres to allow for his dream, \\"a place for contemplation and the getting of wisdom\\". The design and imagery used in the garden is based on this philosophy, to create spaces and symbols for shelter, repose and to nourish the mind, epitomised by his building of the circular \\"Treasury of Wisdom\\" and \\"The Haven\\". Other structures include 2 stone archways on the entrance drive, observation/viewing platforms, contemplative pool and fish pond, brick and timber pergolas, concrete urns, low brick and stone walls, rockeries, steps and terraces all linked by concrete paths with a crazy paving motif. A number of small garden sculptures including a sculpture of Pan and various urns and ornaments providing an element of contemplation. He tilled the 7 acres of garden almost entirely by himself, moving the soil, mulch, plants and implements in the boot of his car. He often worked through the night by lamplight, and it was said that the neighbours always knew which part of the garden was being worked by following the movement of the lamp. Klein did not believe in watering a garden: \\"survival of the fittest\\" he said. The present water supply is joined to the local town system but the pipes around the garden are 1940s vintage and water pressure generally low. The system has a restricted life span and taps do not reach all areas of the garden.Darling, 1995 The existing stonework and embellishments emanate from the Klein era, which ended when Klein gifted Hillview back to the state government (1985). =Modern government ownership= In 1985 Klein gifted \\"Hillview\\" to the NSW Government on condition that he was given tenancy for the term of his life and that if the government wished to dispose of the property prior to 2005, ownership would revert to his family. The resident caretaker, Vic Tatt and his wife Helen who went to Hillview in 1987 and cared for Klein in his last 3 years stayed on and cared for the property. They lived in the cottage, originally the stableman's quarters, 1898, behind the homestead. In the 1990s Damien Miller became intrigued with Hillview when attending an open garden day. The house was in a dilapidated state, although essential work on the roof and to meet fire safety requirements had been done and a conservation plan had been prepared. In 1999 he responded to a government advertisement calling for expressions of interest in conserving and adapting Hillview. If he undertook certain works within a certain time frame he would be rewarded with a lease. Although initially estimating the restoration would take two years it stretched on until 2005.Australian Garden History Society, SHB newsletter, 10/2012 By the mid 1990s the garden was showing neglect. All of Klein's garden sculptures were characterised by a very economical use of materials, some of his timber pergolas were constructed from recycled fence posts, the brick structures were single brick-on-edge technique and the stone buildings and walls were a single skin of flat stones standing on their edges fixed together with a minimal use of cement. The condition of structures was very poor and they required reinforcement or removal. Restoration of the garden included clearing of overgrown areas, moving of underplantings to more suitable areas, improving and mulching soil and replanting appropriate to specific areas i.e. the Vice- Regal area and Klein's area. The Southern Highlands Branch of the Australian Garden History Society decided in 1993 to make the conservation of Hillview's garden their main project, working with the Department of Planning. All trees, shrubs and plants were recorded and assessed and restoration of the garden included clearing of overgrown areas, moving of underplantings to more suitable areas, improving and mulching soil and replanting appropriate to specific areas i.e. the Vice-Regal area and Klein's area. Twice yearly open days were arranged when the Society opened the garden to the public in April and October. Boundary fencing was completed so the property could again be a working farm and stock kept out of the garden. A major hawthorn and Scottish broom infestation was removed from the paddocks and work undertaken restoring the garden. Many of Klein's structures were deteriorated: they were archivally recorded and demolished. It was agreed that Klein's 26 years of ownership and garden philosophy should be recognised and therefore the eastern side of the garden is to be retained as he built and planted it. Restoration works included strengthening of the viewing platforms, retaining Klein's contemplation pool, seats, pergola etc. Klein's plantings in this area were pruned, cleared and tidied up, paths and steps made safe. The rest of the garden was restored as it was in its Vice-Regal days.D.M.Taylor Landscape Architects P/L, 1994 In 1997 the Southern Highlands Branch got a $7500 grant for tree care work at Hillview: tree surgery, and the establishment of a guided tree walk with permanent labels for significant trees, creating a level path through the collection, establishing new collections of trees to extend the arboretum and install tree guards for paddock trees. The Branch's working bees and open days at Hillview ceased 2003.Australian Garden History, 1997, 25 A plaque mounted on a stone near the driveway \\"turn\\" to the house records this involvement. Miller finally completed the restoration of Hillview in 2005, having taken four years longer than anticipated. He subsequently wound up in a legal dispute with the Heritage Council over whether he could obtain a lease, the Heritage Council having twice ordered him to stop work during renovations over various issues. He initiated a case in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 2007, which was eventually resolved in 2011, at which time he signed a 40-year lease of Hillview. The four-roomed Aide-de-Camp (ADC) Quarters was severely damaged by a fallen oak tree in storms early in 2010. The tree has mostly been removed and the building secured and repaired. Miller opened Hillview as a boutique hotel in late 2011. It continues to operate as a hotel and wedding venue.  Description  The residence \\"Hillview\\" is located towards the southern portion of its site at the highest point of the 60.4 hectare rural property. =Homestead complex= Hillview is a late Victorian complex of buildings constructed predominantly of timber and corrugated iron with elements of brick and stone. The existing buildings reflect a variety of styles and design that do not present a consistent appearance. The buildings are fragmented, highly articulated, varied in roof pitch, cladding materials, proportions and details. The buildings reflect their form in 1899 after completion of a period of vice-regal additions and changes. There are 38 habitable rooms in the main two storey house and associated staff wings, including 27 bedrooms, and a further 14 ancillary rooms - toilets, bathrooms, laundries and storage. The total floor area is in the order of 940 metres square. A caretaker's house with six rooms is situated south of the main house, with garages and stables completing the complex. The incremental construction of the main house, built around a smaller brick and stone L-shaped building, has resulted in a structure with a maze of corridors linking rooms and staircases. The buildings retain the Vice-regal form of 1899 with minor adaptations. =Gardens= An English elm (Ulmus procera) and Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra 'Italica') tree-lined carriageway follows a drainage depression climbing the hill east and north of and reaching up to the main house through informal parkland before circling behind (west and south of) the house and gardens. The driveway terminates south of the house, adjacent to outbuildings forming a rear courtyard. A paddock almost encircled by the climbing drive (on its east and south) is planted with Himalayan cedars (Cedrus deodara) and elms. On the upper drive's slope is a large mature evergreen oak (Quercus sp.) tree (see discussion below). A Camellia japonica cv. (double hot pink) shrub flanks the drive. The flower garden and shrubbery were sited toward the western side of the house, acting as a transition from the screened service area. The only other plantings were the foundation plantings around the house. A series of intact walkways divided the beds, which were edged with terracotta tiles. The parkland wraps around the garden opening out to a series of vistas. A second gate indicates the formal house entry as distinct from the servants' entry and the carriage loop sweeps around to the front of the house. The central ground consisted of an island of grass with a bed of roses. Beyond the carriage loop is an expanse of gently sloping lawn with a rose garden that radiates in a fan from a circular bed. An existing bull bay/evergreen magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) is one of the few remaining specimen trees from the early planting.Gutteridge, Haskins & Davey 1989: 8-10 The boundaries and curtilage remain in their 1872 form, with cycles of embellishment and neglect reflecting the changing tides of governmental attitude to spending and to the role of the governors. Moore's layout of 1872 is still legible today, not least from its rich plant collection, particularly in tree species, featuring conifers, oak species and some New Zealand plants popular between the 1890s and 1930s. The driveway and pines from the 1890s were replaced with English elms (Ulmus procera) and Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra 'Italica') between 1934 and the 1950s. New Zealand plants include lemonwood/tarata (Pittosporum eugenioides), flax/harakeke (Phormium tenax) and green and purple forms of cabbage tree/ti kouka (Cordyline australis). Chinese plants are another theme, including Kerria japonica, beauty bush (Kolkwitzia amabilis), honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), cherry plums (Prunus cerasifera cv.s) and flowering cherries (Prunus serrulata cv.s). The garden makes good use of surrounding views and borrowed landscape and garners shelter with thick planting.Stuart Read, 2001 The shrubbery contains other camellia cultivars (formal double pink; and \\"Roma Risorto\\" a white double, spotted finely with crimson), Japanese wisteria (Wisteria floribunda), Monterey pines, cypresses and an array of old-fashioned shrubs. The gardens have been replanned, replanted and extended by Klein and dedicated to the memory of his mother. The property boundaries have remained the same from the early 1870s. = Modifications and dates = * 1872-5: original \\"Prospect\\" house developed along with garden * 1875-1882: ** Timber sitting room with attached store room added ** Timber Chapel added ** Stone single storey extension to kitchen ** Timber addition to chapel and store room ** Charles Moore supervised laying out of grounds and garden: its main elements were a long serpentine driveway, rose garden and parkland opening out to magnificent views.

Heritage listing  Hillview has exceptional significance to the people of New South Wales as the former country home of the governors of New South Wales. The house and its assemblage are a rare surviving collection that not only relates to its gubernatorial occupation but also demonstrates ways of life, taste and decoration from the 1880s to the 1950s. It is the most intact government summer residence to survive and provides insights into the lives and lifestyles of the governors not seen at Government House, Sydney. Hillview was the Vice Regal country residence for Governors of NSW between 1882 and 1957. Sixteen Governors used it over a period of 75 years. It reflects government policies, attitudes and budgetary considerations from 1882 to 1957. The site retains its curtilage from the early 1870s and the buildings are in the form known in 1899 following the completion of the Vice Regal additions with only minor alterations since. The Vice Regal contents are largely intact and clearly indicate the way the buildings were occupied and used. Hillview, including the site, buildings, gardens, archaeological features, fittings and contents has exceptional significance to the people of NSW as the former country home of the Governors of NSW. The house and its assemblage are a rare surviving collection that not only relate to its gubernatorial occupation but demonstrate ways of life, taste and decoration from the 1880s period through to the 1950s period. Their value is enhanced as the place has been largely untouched since 1957 following the departure of the last Governor prior to the sale of the property. Hillview has been associated with a range of significant people in the history of NSW including Governors, architects and landscapers, as well as numerous visitors during the occupation of the Governors. Hillview is of significance in its relationship to Government House Sydney and other Government houses and country retreats throughout Australia. It is the most intact Government summer residence to survive and provides insights into the lives and lifestyles of the Governors that is not seen at Government House Sydney. Hillview through the buildings, furnishings, gardens and archaeological potential has the ability to reveal new information about the broader history and development of NSW due to the intact form of most parts of the assemblage from its Government occupation.Davies 2000: 96 Hillview was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The place has been the country or summer home of the Governors from 1882 to 1957. It is the second country home of the Governors preceded only by Old Government House at Parramatta. It has had a continuity of use that has demonstrated a pattern of life esteemed in the community and has been an integral part of the Government of the state and the cultural life of eth Governors and their families. It is the only Governor's country residence to survive intact in Australia. The place demonstrates the development of the state and nation, the role of Governors and broader patterns of settlement within the Southern Highlands area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The place has most obviously been the country home of the Governors for 75 years. As a group they are of high significance of the cultural and political development of the history of NSW. The house demonstrates their patterns of occupancy and use, as do surviving contents and furnishings. Individual Governors are also of significance to the place through their role in either the purchase (Loftus), making a significance impact (Wakehurst) or in the sale of the property (Northcott). Hillview has historical significance, through several of the Governors as significant events related to the Government of the State took place there. The place is significant for its association with a number of other prominent figures in NSW including Charles Moore, attributed with the garden layout, Professor Waterhouse, attributed with major changes to the garden and James Barnet, attributed with the design of the house. Prior to its Government acquisition the place was owned by Richardson, who appears to have built the house. As founder of Richardson and Wrench, one of the major real estate and stock and station agents in NSW, his association with the property is strong. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The house, despite its rambling form and unusual layout, is aesthetically pleasing and is set within an important extensive garden. The house demonstrates Victorian ideals in massing and siting and the ability to adapt to structures in unusual and what now appears as illogical ways. Hillview is a landmark site within the Southern Highlands, not only for its association with the Governors but also for the buildings and the other major plantings that crown the hilltop and which are viewed from all directions in the district. The buildings demonstrate a broad range of construction techniques, including the early use of kit buildings, that typify late Victorian construction. The furniture contents demonstrate high levels of technical and creative achievement, particularly seen in the dining room suite by Verdich and a number of other fine pieces in the collection. The collection of furniture is also of high significance as it is a complete collection of Government furniture made for, acquired for and collected for Hillview between 1882 and 1957. The close association of the place with Government House, Sydney, and the transfer of furniture between the properties is also of significance as it strongly relates the Hillview furniture collection to the collection at Government House making them collectively one of the major State furniture collections in NSW. The gardens demonstrate significant aesthetic characteristics both in the Government garden and the Klein additions. The garden appears to contain significant plantings from a range of periods and provides an insight into garden and property management extending back to the occupation of the early Governors. The property demonstrates patterns of settlement and amalgamation of early grants with the boundaries remaining unchanged since the purchase of the various lots by Richardson. This also reflects the stability of property holdings in the Sutton Forest area since settlement. Views to and from the garden and buildings into the surrounding countryside are also of significance as they demonstrate Victorian and Edwardian ideals in landscape design and setting. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. 'Hillview' was the Vice Regal country residence used by sixteen successive Governors of NSW. It reflects government policies, attitudes and budgetary considerations from 1882 to 1957 in relation to the office of Governor. The buildings retain the form known in 1899 following the completion of the Vice Regal additions. The site retains its curtilage from the early 1870s and the Vice Regal contents are largely intact and clearly indicate the way the buildings were occupied and used. The fabric as a document clearly indicates the successive physical changes reflecting changes of occupant, style and taste. This occupation makes Hillview important as a social document which has the ability to interpret the changing role of Governor from Colonial times to the Post WW2 period. It retains its Vice Regal character of the late 1950s despite its more recent ownership. Much of the contents date from the 1880s and 1890s and were either purchased for the property or had come from Government House in Sydney. The contents are a valuable collection in their own right. The collection is unique in maintaining its associations with the Governors who used the residence. Adapted from Partridge & Davies 1989 Since Mr Klein's ownership the place has become identified with the local community through charity open days and his hospitality. The residence is a local landmark which is the focus of considerable community interest. It is the only Governor's country residence of the period with intact contents surviving in Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Hillview has exceptional potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of NSW's cultural history. As the former home of the governors, Hillview has potential to provide information on their way of life and the role of the Governors in NSW's political and social life. Because the house has been unaltered since its Government ownership and has remained static since 1957, it provides insight into the life of the Governors that is unique. The understanding and insights from Hillview differ greatly from those available at Government House Sydney, or Old Government House, Parramatta. Government House provides insights into the official life of the Governors as well as some insights into their family life in the city. Old Government House, which has not been occupied by the Governors for over a century no longer contains any elements of the Governors occupation. In contrast Hillview provides insights into the leisure and family life of the Governors through the house, the grounds, the furnishings and the contents. The contents in particular provide evidence of the activities of the Governors families at Hillview. This is enhanced by the furniture and contents collection which is a unique collection of items all related to the Governors use of the property and the operation of the property. The buildings also provide clear evidence of the change and development of the place, principally between 1882 and 1899 when most of the development of the site took place, but also the smaller changes that have taken place this century. The building fabric is capable of a high level of interpretation and understanding that can provide insights into planning, construction and ways of life. Hillview has research potential through its known and potential archaeological resource. This resource has been clearly established for the occupation of the property following white settlement and has the potential to extend to earlier aboriginal occupation of the site. The gardens retain trees / species believed to date from 1882 as selected by Mr Charles Moore, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is only one of two Governors country retreats that have survived in Australia and it is the only one to retain its setting, fitout and furnishings. The complete assembly of buildings, garden and contents makes Hillview an extremely rare place. The connection between these elements and the occupancy of the Governors makes Hillview an exceptional property where the lives of the Governors can be seen and understood outside the formality of Government House, Sydney. Despite the sale of the property in 1957 to Edwin Klein and its subsequent 40 years of non- intervention, the place has retained its appearance and general fitout from the period of the Governors occupation. This allows a rare encapsulated view of the Governors and their occupation of the place. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Hillview demonstrates a way of life that has been lost. The survival of the fitout from the time of eth Governors, demonstrates tastes and fashions over a period of 75 years government occupation. Apart from its connection with the Governors, Hillview is an excellent and intact example of a country house in the Southern Highlands area that has not undergone extensive upgrading or refitting. The place demonstrates Government policy, attitudes and budgetary considerations between 1882 and 1957. This can be seen in the haphazard nature of the alterations and additions and the apparent randomness of maintenance carried out.

According to the National Bureau of Investigation, the three different events were the doing of a one-person, who has been called the J√§rvenp√§√§ Serial Killer.  The crimes  = Abduction of Helena Meril√§inen = In November 1990, 39-year-old Helena \\"Hellu\\" Meril√§inen was spending her evening at J√§rvenp√§√§. She left her friend at midnight and was about to travel home to Riihim√§ki. She walked to the train station and left waiting for the train on the pier, when she was soon followed by a dark-haired man dressed in a leather jacket. The man asked about her travel plans, and she told him that she was expecting to catch a train to Riihim√§ki. The man offered Meril√§inen a ride home, and because she was under the influence of alcohol, she agreed. He then walked her to his car, which Meril√§inen later stated in the interrogations was a light-coloured passenger car, not a station wagon, probably an elder Mazda or Datsun.YLE - Kadonneet: Perjantai 13. p√§iv√§ At the start of the trip, the man offered alcoholic beverages and some form of medicine in the form of capsules, to which Meril√§inen accepted both. The man himself took several of the capsules during the drive. During the trip, she noticed that the man seemed distressed and that he had a child seat at the back. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Meril√§inen noticed that the car was not on the road to Riihim√§ki, but on a remote forest path. When she asked the man about the route, he assured her that he was still on the right way. The man drove the car to a dark gravel pit and stopped the car. He tried to persuade Meril√§inen to stay in the car for a night, but she refused and said that she wanted to go home. At that point, the man said that he needed to go urinate and left the car, with Meril√§inen feeling the same need and also leaving the car. When Meril√§inen squatted, the man quickly approached and struck her to head with the edge of a knife. Despite the injury, Meril√§inen managed to flee towards the forest. She heard the man say \\"I did not succeed this time\\". When she started running, the man spoke something to himself and entered his car. After a while, Meril√§inen found a road to a house and alerted them for help. An ambulance was called, and she got away with minor physical injuries. She was apparently saved by a thick woollen knit cap. = Tuula Lukkarinen = In April 1991, 28-year-old Tuula Lukkarinen left Kellokoski psychiatric hospital on vacation, with the purpose of travelling to Hyryl√§ for a custody case for her son. She left the hospital at around 8.30 in the morning. However, she never made it to Hyryl√§, and was last seen in J√§rvenp√§√§ at around nine o'clock am waiting on a liquor store to open.OTETAAN KIINNI Tuula Lukkarisen SURMAAJA!/LET'S CATCH THE KILLER of Tuula Lukkarinen!, Alibi 9/1991. Retrieved 28 May 2019. The next day, a landowner discovered her badly mutilated body in the woods near a gravel pit, the body being less than 100 metres away from the place where, a five months earlier, Meril√§inen was attacked. According to police, Lukkarinen was transported to Hausj√§rvi between the day of disappearance and the day of discovery and the time of death had been around midnight. The body had been dragged a few dozen meters to the woods from a small road that led to the gravel pits. A blizzard had hit the area during the hours after her death and caused damage to the crime scene. According to police Lukkarinen was not raped.OTETAAN KIINNI Tuula Lukkarisen SURMAAJA!/LET'S CATCH THE KILLER of Tuula Lukkarinen!, Alibi 9/1991. Retrieved 28 May 2019. = Maarit Haantie = 40-year-old Maarit Haantie disappeared in August 1993, and is also suspected of being the victim of a possible serial killer. Her body was searched for by the local authorities to no avail. The NBI began investigating the cases of the three women as the doing of one killer, arguing that many factors, such as the use of alcohol, the dark hair color and being in the same area contributed to the theory. According to NBI they also have information that connects the disappearance to the two earlier cases that they won't publish due to an open investigation.Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hiki√§ serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008.  Disappearance  Haantie was attending a party at the restaurant Zapata in J√§rvenp√§√§ on August 13, 1993. She was going there with her partner and a few friends. All of them got in the restaurant except Haantie. Haantie was not let in by the doorman because of her drunkenness. She was last seen standing outside the building, and hasn't been seen since.  Investigation  The disappearance of Haantie was initially filed to the Riihim√§ki Police, who treated the case as a normal disappearance without any indication of homicide. Soon, however, it was discovered that a bag belonging to Haantie had been found in a restaurant called Martina at the town of Hyvink√§√§. During interviews with the staff, it was apparent that the employees had removed a drunk person who resembled Maarit Haantie. It soon became clear that in 1991, a woman by the name of Tuula Lukkarinen had been found brutally murdered in a Hausj√§rvi gravel pit. Earlier, in 1990, Helena Meril√§inen was attacked in the same area where Lukkarinen's body was discovered five months later. Helena had been hit with a knife, but managed to escape. The police assumed that Meril√§inen had been attacked by the same man who had killed Tuula Lukkarinen. The whole chain of events mentioned above had drawn the attention of the NBI, and soon the case of Haantie was included in the investigation. A large search was carried out in the woods around the Hausj√§rvi municipality and especially the gravel pits area south of Hiki√§ village, but nothing was found. The investigation, however, has remained active to this day. In 2007, the television series \\"Kadonneet\\", \\"Disappeared\\" did an episode on Haantie's case, which attracted a lot of attention. In the section, the NBI specifically asked for a hint about a dark-haired man in J√§rvenp√§√§ in the early 90s who offered rides to women, as described by Helena Meril√§inen. Helena Meril√§inen, Tuula Lukkarinen and Maarit Haantie were combined the use of alcohol, dark hair and living environment, with the NBI believing that the same perpetrator is responsible for all three cases. The Kadonneet episode gathered about 30 new tips, which helped with the offender's profiling. According to the NBI, the hints have been very important for the investigation, and have confirmed the results of earlier profiling. Investigation is still active, and the Bureau strongly believes that there have been other murder attempts. The NBI has searched for Haantie from the forest areas in Hausj√§rvi as late as in 2017, claiming that they have information that connects Haantie to the area.Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hiki√§ serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008. = Fourth case = In 2017 it was published in the media that there had been a possible fourth case involving the murders. In 1989 a drunken 30-year-old woman had just exited a restaurant in J√§rvenp√§√§ when a man offered her a ride, offering her alcohol and pills and then driving her to a forest area, the case resembling the case of Helena Meril√§inen's. Although the woman did make it, the victim's mother brought it up after the woman had died of natural causes years later. = Similar unsolved cases in the area = In year 1988 there were several cases of a man with a similar description and driving a white Volkswagen Passat liftback harassing women in the areas close by and even attempting to abduct a 19-year-old woman in H√§meenlinna by threatening her with a pistol while the woman was able to escape from a moving car.Nykyposti 1/89, January 1989 In December 1987 a 19-year-old woman Heidi H√§r√∂ went missing in M√§nts√§l√§ after leaving a local bar and probably hitching a ride. Her decomposed body was found five months later from a forest area in Pukkila with some of her clothes missing.Kadonnut nainen l√∂ytyi kuolleena Pukkilassa/Missing woman found dead in Pukkila Helsingin Sanomat, 03.05.1988.  Offender's profile  Over the years, the perpetrator has been profiled largely based on Meril√§inen's story and events, with the description as following: * At the time of the events in 1990, the man was between 30 and 40 years old, and had a dark, curly hair. * He is about 1.70 m tall. * He knows the anatomy of a human or a large animal (according to the Lukkarinen murder). * He possibly had an infant child at the time, as the car's back seat had a child restraint. * The car itself is thought to be a Sedan Mazda or Datsun. * He was familiar with the towns of J√§rvenp√§√§, Hyvink√§√§ and Riihim√§ki that locate along the railway and with the forest area around the Hiki√§ village. * It is believed that he is unable to form a normal relationship with a woman. * The man had spoken about his child and told he had a bad relationship with his wife, and is believed that he might have divorced. A lot of new tips about the killer have been provided due to the Kadonneet episode. According to some, a dark-haired man is believed to have offered rides to a few women still in the 21st century. According to the tips a man fitting to the description has last been offering a ride to a woman in year 2006. The NBI is still investigating the case, believing that the killer can be found. They have also taken into account that the killer hasn't been found yet because he might be living abroad or is dead.

He was one of the six poets who were known for their Digambara (naked) Poetry that flourished during the mid-1960s in Andhra Pradesh. Early life Raju, whose real name was Baddam Bhaskara Reddy, was born into a farming family in Ankusapuram village of Nalgonda district in 1944. Chera, as he was endearingly called by his friends, was influenced by the literary works of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay and Rabindranath Tagore during his formative years. Even the legendary poet Sri Sri derived a lot of inspiration from him and dedicated his most popular anthology of poems Maha Prasthanam to Chera. Political life Cherabanda Raju was a teacher by profession and held a degree in Oriental Literature. His literary works include Ganjineellu, Nippurallu, Gamyam, Kattipaata, Diksoochi, Muttadi and Kaanti Yuddham. He, through his poetry, advocated the betterment of the oppressed classes such as Dalits and peasants and fought for their rights. After the Digambara School of poetry had lost steam and became a spent force, he cofounded Virasam (Viplava Rachayitala Sangham) along with other revolutionary poets such as Varavara Rao, Sri Sri, Kutumba Rao and Ramana Reddy, and continued his poetic journey. During his lifetime he was harassed by law enforcement agencies, implicated in many cases and jailed. While serving prison sentence his health deteriorated and he died of brain tumor at the age of 38.

Career  Ren√©e Toole Kahane studied Romance philology at the Universities of Leipzig and Berlin, receiving her PhD in 1931 under the supervision of . In 1931, she married Henry R. Kahane, whom she had met in 1927 when they were fellow PhD students in Berlin. They became lifelong intellectual partners. After obtaining their PhDs, Henry and Ren√©e Kahane moved to Florence where they spent several years collecting a large corpus of Venetian loanwords used in Greek dialects. Following Henry's brief imprisonment in Florence by Mussolini as part of a general round up of immigrant Jews, the Kahanes moved to Cephalonia, Greece, Ren√©e Kahane's birthplace. From there they managed to emigrate to the US in 1939. From 1939-1941 they lived in Los Angeles. In 1941 they moved to the University of Illinois when Henry took up a position, first, in the department of Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese and then in the department of Linguistics (which he founded). They stayed there for the remainder of their careers. A Festschift in honor of Henry and Ren√©e Kahane was published by the University of Illinois Press in 1973. Henry and Ren√©e Kahane are estimated to have had a scholarly output of at least a dozen books and well over one hundred and fifty other publications dealing with various aspects of literary history and linguistics, such as etymology, Romance and Mediterranean lexicography, stylistics, morphology, and dialectology. Beginning in the 1960s their particular focus became the investigation and recovery of the Hellenic heritage to the West, including a sociolinguistic study of the relations between Byzantium and the West told through the reciprocal borrowings of words.  Honors  Henry and Ren√©e Kahane were awarded Bicentennial Gold Medals by the Georgetown University Linguistics Department in 1989 in recognition of their lifetime contributions to the field of Romance linguistics. Henry and Ren√©e Kahane were awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1977 and the Freie Universit√§t-Berlin in 1988.

As a two-year-old in 1989 she won two of her four races including the May Hill Stakes. In the following year she was undefeated in three starts, taking the Princess Elizabeth Stakes and the Lingfield Oaks Trial before recording her biggest victory in the Prix de Diane. After her retirement from racing she became a prolific and successful broodmare whose foals include Invincible Spirit. Background Rafha was a \\"tiny\\" bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner, A A Faisal's Nawara Stud. She was sent into training with Henry Cecil at his Warren Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was ridden in all but two of her races by Steve Cauthen. She was sired by Kris, an outstanding miler who won fourteen of his sixteen races between 1978 and 1980. Kris's other progeny included Oh So Sharp, Unite, Balisada, Shavian and Shamshir. Rafha's dam Eljazzi won one minor race from four starts in Britain in 1983 and 1984. She was a granddaughter of B Flat (foaled 1958) whose other descendants included Bachir, Pitcairn and Assessor. Eljazzi had been bought for Faisal by the bloodstock agent Johnnie Lewis who had previously had great success as a bobsleigh racer. Racing career =1989: two-year-old season= Rafha's first contest, a maiden race over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 2 June was barely a race at all as she started at odds of 1/14 and won easily by two and a half lengths from her only opponent. Willie Ryan took the ride a month later when the filly ran in a minor event at Newmarket Racecourse and finished second, beaten half a length by the Luca Cumani-trained Agri Dagri. On her next start, over seven furlongs at Epsom Racecourse on 28 August she led for most of the way before being overtaken in the final strides and being beaten a neck by Ruby Tiger, to whom she was conceding ten pounds in weight. On 13 September Rafha was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 3 May Hill Stakes over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse and started the 11/8 favourite against four opponents. After being restrained at the rear of the field she made steady progress in the straight, overtook the front-running Knight's Baroness a furlong from the finish and won by a length. =1990: three-year-old season= Rafha made her first appearance as a three-year-old in the Listed Princess Elizabeth Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom on 24 April. Starting the even money favourite an eight-runner field she took the lead a furlong out and accelerated away from her rivals to win by ten lengths from the Ian Balding-trained Spurned. On 12 May the filly started 8/13 favourite for the Listed Oaks Trial over eleven and half furlongs at Lingfield Park and won by a neck from Knights Baroness after taking the lead approaching the final furlong. On 10 June Rafha was sent to France to contest the Prix de Diane over 2000 metres at Chantilly Racecourse in which she was partnered by the 47-year-old veteran Willie Carson. Her thirteen rivals included Houseproud (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches), Atoll (Oaks d'Italia), Air de Rien (Prix Saint-Alary) and Moon Cactus (Prestige Stakes). After pulling hard in the early stages Rafha turned into the straight in sixth place and then accelerated through the field to take the lead 200 metres from the finish. She kept on strongly in the closing stages and won by half a length from Colour Chart with Moon Cactus a further half a length back in third place. After an inquiry by the racecourse stewards Colour Chart was disqualified for hampering the fourth-placed finisher Air de Rien. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Rafha was retired to become a broodmare for the Nawara Stud. She produced at least fourteen foals and eleven winners between 1992 and 2009: *Al Widyan, a bay colt, foaled in 1992, sired by Slip Anchor. Won three races. *Sadian, bay colt, 1995, by Shirley Heights. Won six races including the John Porter Stakes and Ormonde Stakes. *Fnan, bay colt (later gelded), 1996, by Generous.

It is the major authority for training, selection, equipping, preparation and deployment of individuals and units from the Ministry of Defense and Serbian Armed Forces to multinational operations outside the borders of the Republic of Serbia.  History  Following the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Army and the Army of Serbia and Montenegro joined multinational operations in 2002. They participated in UNMISET in East Timor and ONUB in Burundi. In these multinational operations, the officers were individually deployed as military observers. Deploying individual officers requires the existence of an organizational unit to coordinate activities in selecting staff, logistics, preparing for specific duties and resolving their status. Since 2002 peacekeeping missions in the military were coordinated by the Section for International Integration and Peace Operations from the Operational Department of the General Staff of the Army of Serbia and Montenegro. On October 14, 2003, this section became the National Center for Peacekeeping Missions, subordinated to the Deputy Chief of General Staff of the Army of Serbia and Montenegro. The Peacekeeping Operations Center, as the legal successor of the National Center for Peacekeeping Missions, was established on January 1, 2005. Thereafter, it was subordinated to the Joint Operations Command of the General Staff. The Peacekeeping Operations Center celebrates its Day on November 17 in memory of the day when, in 1956, the precursor of the YPA Detachment was sent to the UN Emergency Force (UNEF) in Sinai.  Tasks  The center has various duties including: * Selection, training and preparation of personnel and participation in training and preparation * Monitoring, coordination and control * Planning, organization, and transport of individuals, units, weapons and equipment * Planning, organization and execution of national and international courses, seminars and lectures * Development of criteria for manning units and key staff * Proposing individuals for training in the country and abroad * Participate in the selection and development of unit training * Coordination of the preparation of forces with the organizational units of the Ministry of Defense and the Serbian Armed Forces General Staff and the relevant entities in the Republic of Serbia and other international entities and organizations. * Proposing the costs of preparing and deploying individuals and units to participate * Participate in the assessment of the capabilities of the units for deployment * Preparation of the Memorandum of Understanding and technical agreements for the deployment of members of the Serbian Armed Forces * Drafting and amending the normative and legal framework * Cooperation with peace-support operations, training centers and international organizations * Cooperation with the MoD and the General Staff in charge of international military cooperation and training. * Cooperation with international entities for the exchange of ideas and experiences from multinational operations  Organizational structure  The center's organizational structure consists of four other departments and one group: *Department of Human Resources *Department for Operations and Staff Affairs *Department for Training *Department of Support *Finance Group  References  # # # # # # Serbian Army Peacekeeping operations ","title":"Peacekeeping Operations Center"},{"id":"58361268","text":"William Strang, 1882, Potato Lifting, published in The Portfolio. The Portfolio was a British monthly art magazine published in London from 1870 to 1893. It was founded by Philip Gilbert Hamerton and promoted contemporary printmaking, especially etching, and was important in the British Etching Revival. Early contributors included Joseph Beavington Atkinson (1822-1886), Francis Turner Palgrave (1824-1897) and Sidney Colvin (1845-1927). History The mid-nineteenth century in France and Britain saw a rise in the interest in etching. Hamerton had spent the 1860s in France with his French wife, Eug√©nie. The impetus for the launch of The Portfolio came in the wake of the foundation in Paris of the Soci√©t√© des aquafortistes in 1862, and to a lesser extent from the longer established Etching Club from 1838. Etchings by many French etchers such as Paul Rajon (1843-1888) and Benjamin Damman (1835-1921) were a marked feature of the publication. The New York Times lavished praise on the publication when, in 1875, it remarked that it could not \\"eulogize too highly the merits of this periodical in all its departments. It is, without question, the most beautiful in regard to illustration which emanates from the press.\\"'New Publications', The New York Times, 23 March 1875, p.10.

In a medical examination, sexual abuse of 34 out of 42 inmates living at the shelter was confirmed. A first information report was lodged against 12 people on May 31, 2018. Brajesh Thakur was the chief of the state- funded NGO, ran several other NGOs and a Hindi newspaper called 'Pratah Kamal'. Because of the political connections of Brajesh Thakur and the involvement of government officials and the apparent delay in investigation and CBI interference, the case drew criticism of Nitish Kumar's government by opposition and the Supreme Court of India. Discovery In May 2018, reports of repeated sexual abuse of inmates at a short stay home in Muzaffarpur, India, surfaced after Mumbai‚Äôs Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) carried out a social audit of shelter homes across Bihar for 2017. The audit report pointed to sexual abuse of girls at the Muzaffarpur short-stay home. TISS submitted its report in April 2018 and the government after its review registered the FIR on 31 May. Following the expose, the girls were rescued from the shelter home and shifted to Madhubani, Patna and Mokama. Later the medical board of Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) in June confirmed the sexual abuse of a majority of the girls of the ‚ÄòBalika Grih‚Äô. Brajesh Thakur, main accused in the Muzaffarpur shelter home rape case, has been booked in another case after it was found that 11 women were missing from another shelter home his NGO ran. Of the 42 girls housed at Balika Grih, medical tests have confirmed sexual assault on 34. While girls were allegedly forced to undergo abortion, one was allegedly killed and buried on the shelter home campus. In late June the authorities dug the vacant space inside the Muzaffarpur short-stay home over allegations that one girl was allegedly killed and buried after an argument with the staff. The authorities, however, did not find any human body. On 2 August 2018, Supreme Court of India took a suo moto cognizance in the Muzaffarpur shelter home case. Brajesh Thakur is the prime accused in Muzaffarpur shelter home case where 34 girls, aged between 7 and 17, were raped for months. Ten out of 11 accused have been arrested, including Thakur and the then district child protection officer. They are to be tried under the POCSO act. The case was later transferred to the CBI which has taken over the probe and has obtained all relevant documents from the local police. Trial and Verdict On the directions of Supreme Court's CJI Ranjan Gogoi bench, the case, as requested by CBI, was transferred in February 2019 from a local court in Muzaffarpur to the POCSO court at Saket district court in Delhi. SC asked the Saket court to conclude the trial within six months. https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-transfers- muzaffarpur-shelter-home-sexual-assault-case-from-bihar-to- delhi/article26201443.ece The court, in 1,546 page judgment, convicted Brajesh Thakur and 18 others, in January 2020. https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/muzaffarpur-shelter-home-case- brajesh-thakur-among-19-convicted-by-court-sentencing-on-jan-28/1829045/ Thakur was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for offences under \\"Indian Penal Code sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and those relating to abetment, Section 21 (failure to report commission of an offence) of the POCSO Act and Section 75 (cruelty to child) of the Juvenile Justice Act.\\" Shaista Praveen, Indu Kumari, Minu Devi, Manju Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari, Hema Masih, Kiran Kumari were held guilty of \\"criminal conspiracy, abetment to rape, cruelty to child and failure to report commission of an offence.\\" Dillip Kumar Verma, Ravi Roshan, Vikas Kumar, Vijay Kumar Tiwari, Rama Shankar Singh, Ashwani, Guddu Patel, Kishan Kumar and Ramanuj Thakur were also held guilty in the case on various counts. https://m.hindustantimes.com/india- news/muzaffarpur-shelter-home-convict-brajesh-thakur-11-others-sentenced-to- life-imprisonment/story-gPYZr7Yk9Yn8Y3T2gHClCP.html Thakur has challenged the verdict in Delhi High Court.

Established in 1938, it covers the area of 16,64 hectares in the district of Polesie and is home to 2,245 animals representing 667 species. As the only zoo in Poland, it houses the endangered Asiatic lions. The zoo is a member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria, the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums and is also part of the International Species Information System. History The zoo was opened in 1938 in the Polesie district and covered the area of 8,9 hectares. In 1939, the zoo was in possession of only 50 animals such as deer, roe deer, fallow deer, ducks and sheep. The zoo emerged relatively unscathed after the Second World War and in 1945, many animals from other zoological gardens, most notably from the Wroc≈Çaw Zoo, were transported to ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In 1950, the area of the zoo was expanded and covered 16,64 ha. In the 1950s, the zoological garden developed more rapidly as more buildings and structures were constructed including the baboons enclosure. In 1968, the Big Cats' pavilion was opened and in 1988, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the zoo, a pavilion for giraffes was constructed. Since 1991, the zoo is part of the International Species Information System. In 2001, an enclosure for antelopes was built as well as new aviaries for owls and birds of prey. In 2011, a special pavilion showcasing the zoo's collection of butterflies was opened. In 2014, a pavilion housing small mammals such as binturongs, ring-tailed mongooses and Indian crested porcupines was built. In 2015, the construction of the Orientarium building started. It is the biggest investment in the history of the zoo and is expected to be opened in 2019. The whole complex will specifically feature the fauna of Southeast Asia and will house such animals as orangutans, surilis, clouded leopards and sharks. The zoo's breeding program had a number of successes which include the births of southern cassowaries in 2014 and 2016, pied tamarin in 2014 and lynx in 2015.

An international group of scientists discovered Rosehip neurons and announced their discovery in August 2018. These authors contributed equally to this work: Eszter Boldog (University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary), Trygve E. Bakken (Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, WA, United States), and Rebecca D. Hodge (Allen Institute for Brain Science, Seattle, WA, United States). Rosehip neurons are named after the rose hip fruit due to the axon terminal's resemblance to the berries of rose hip. These rosehip cells show an immunohistochemical profile (GAD1+CCK+, CNR1‚ÄìSST‚ÄìCALB2‚ÄìPVALB‚Äì) matching a single transcriptomically defined cell type whose specific molecular marker signature is not seen in mouse cortex. Rosehip cells in layer 1 make homotypic gap junctions, predominantly target apical dendritic shafts of layer 3 pyramidal neurons, and inhibit backpropagating pyramidal action potentials in microdomains of the dendritic tuft. These cells are therefore positioned for potent local control of distal dendritic computation in cortical pyramidal neurons.

Early life and education  Voss is a native of Germany and holds degrees in history and archival preservation and management. She attended the University of Massachusetts in Amherst for her BA in History and MA in United States Political, Social, and Women‚Äôs History. She completed her Master's in Library Science at New York State University in Albany.  Career  She became a feminist while studying to be an archivist, and wrote the article \\"No Documents-No History\\" for the American Archivist in 1995. In it, she describes the journey of Mary Ritter Beard and attempts to found a \\"World Center for Women's Archives\\". In her struggle to prove that women's place in history was of equal importance to men's, Beard argued that documentary evidence can support claims that women were instrumental in all facets of society and not just peace movements. This view caused somewhat of an upheaval in the Suffragette movement at the time, which focused on women's peacekeeping role, and the WCWA folded in 1940. Undaunted, Beard set about finding homes for the collected archives and concentrated on Smith and Radcliffe archival initiatives, and thanks to Margaret Storrs Grierson, Smith now has the Sophia Smith Collection. Voss-Hubbard remarked that the formation of archives often rests with non-archivists and in the words of Beard, that the \\"stimulation of interest\\" is possibly the greatest achievement.\\"No Documents‚ÄîNo History\\": Mary Ritter Beard and the Early History of Women's Archives, by Anke Voss-Hubbard, American Archivist, 1995 After writing her influential article, Voss-Hubbard went on to become a digital collections specialist. She was an assistant editor on the Margaret Sanger Papers Project at Smith College, being instrumental in making the Sanger papers accessible, as well as other documents regarding birth control and other subjects from the Sophia Smith Collection and other archives. From 1995 to 1999, she worked at the Rockefeller Archive Center in New York City as an archivist and preservation officer. In 2000, she became the Archivist and Special Collections librarian for Illinois Wesleyan University, and remained in that role until 2005. She then became Director of Archives at the Urbana Free Library, and served as an adjunct lecturer at the University of Illinois School of Information Sciences. Since 2019, she has served as the Curator for the Concord Free Public Library. Voss-Hubbard co-edited the 2013 book Perspectives on Women's Archives with Tanya Zanish-Belcher.

The aim of the game is to get rid of all the Hearts from the pack. It is basically a German adaptation of an earlier game called Knockout with slightly different rules, but played mostly the same way.  Rules  Like most games of patience, Herz zu Herz is a card game for one person. It uses a basic Skat deck of 32 cards. At the start of the game, the pack is shuffled and placed as a stock face down on the table. Next, the top three cards are drawn and placed in a row, face up. Any cards of the suit of Hearts are laid off to form a separate stack and this process is repeated four times with three cards each time. After that the rest of the cards in the talon are shuffled with the upcards and three cards are drawn again and the Hearts laid off. This is repeated five times. If this round does not result in all the Hearts being laid off to the Hearts pile, there is a third round of shuffling, drawing three cards and laying off any Heart. The patience is solved if, after this third round, all the Hearts are in their own pile, otherwise, the game is lost.  Variants  The patience game Knockout (also known under the name of Hope Deferred) is also played with 32 cards,\\"Knockout\\" (p.104) in Little Giant Encyclopedia of Games for One or Two, The Diagram Group, 1998. and is played mostly the same way as Herz zu Herz and possibly even the parent game. The difference is that the target suit is clubs instead of hearts and when a space is created in the row, it is filled. Thus, possibly more than 15 cards are dealt per round. There is also an expanded version called Abandon Hope where all 52 French-suited playing cards are used and 24 (or more) are dealt in each of the three rounds.

She appeared in 16 games during the regular season, averaging 2.9 points per game. Haukar dominated during the season, winning all four major trophies; the national championship, the Icelandic Basketball Cup, the Supercup and the Company Cup while also finishing with the best win-loss record in the √örvalsdeild. During the offseason, Haukar lost several key players, including stars Helena Sverrisd√≥ttir and P√°l√≠na Gunnlaugsd√≥ttir. Despite the losses he guided the team to Icelandic Cup finals and the √örvalsdeild playoffs. In the Cup, Haukar lost to Grindav√≠k 77-67. and in the √örvalsdeild playoffs, Haukar were beaten by Keflav√≠k in the semi-finals. During the 2008-2009 season, Ragna started all 29 games, averaging 8.1 points and 9.8 rebounds. She was instrumental in Haukar reaching the √örvalsdeild finals again where they beat KR 3-2. In 2010, she helped Haukar win the Icelandic Cup, scoring 11 points in the 83-77 win against Keflav√≠k in the Cup final.

She was cleared by the Federations disciplinary court as it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over incidents where a referee called a foul on player but did not eject him. =Stjarnan (2015‚Äì2019)= On 19 August 2015, Ragna signed with newly promoted Stjarnan. The season turned out to be highly disappointing with high scoring American guard Chelsie Schweers being fired in December and head coach Baldur Ingi J√≥nasson resigning in February. Despite Ragna averaging 12.6 points and 9.4 rebounds, Stjarnan finished with a 3-21 record, barely escaping relegation. The following season, Ragna averaged 13.0 points and 9.3 rebounds, helping Stjarnan secure a playoff spot for the first time in the club's history. In the playoffs, Stjarnan got swept in the first round by Sn√¶fell. After the season she was named to the Domestic All-First team for the second time in her career.

Dedicated to Saint Margaret, the church has been a Grade I listed building since 1951Church of St Margaret: A Grade I Listed Building in Northam, Devon - Historic England database and comes under the Diocese of Exeter.St Margaret's church, Northam on the Church of England website History and design The Sanctuary with the altar An older Norman church once stood on the site, but the present church is mainly 15th-century while the lower part of the tower is older. The building was comprehensively restored between 1845 and 1870 by public subscription and at the expense of the Rev I.H. Gosset under the direction of architect Daniel Mackintosh of Exeter in the early Perpendicular style and commands an excellent position overlooking the sea with views of Lundy Island in the distance. The 170 feet high tower houses eight bells and is early 15th-century. Because of its prominent position overlooking Bideford Bay it was used for centuries as a guide for shipping in the Bristol Channel with its seaward side being whitewashed for greater visibility. The nave is 13th or 14th-century in date; the church was enlarged with a north aisle as the local population grew during the Elizabethan era as witnessed by the inscription \\"This yele was made Anno 1593\\" ('yele' meaning 'aisle') on one of the arches. The pulpit The Elizabethan barrel vault ceiling is particularly fine and is thought to have been built by local shipwrights who incorporated bosses carved with the Tudor rose, various plant forms and Saint George's Cross together with the symbols of the Passion of Jesus. The Chapel of Saint George is believed to have been the Guild Chapel of the Guild of Saints John and George which existed to help the poor in the Middle Ages.Chance, p. 2 The baptismal font The baptismal font was rediscovered buried under the floor of the tower during the Victorian era and is interesting for its crack and the places on the lip where the locks were positioned to prevent the theft of Holy Water. It was restored in 1848 at the instigation of the Reverend Isaac Henry Gosset who wrote of a local tradition that the font had been broken in two with a sledgehammer by Parliamentary troops during the Civil War.Rev I.H.

The music is written in plainsong and the words are asking 'Lord have mercy upon us.' The Northam Kyrie was discovered in 1933 set into the backing of a churchwarden's book dating from the Elizabethan era. The original is held in the Devon Heritage Centre in Exeter. The pulpit is of Devon marble and replaces a Georgian three decker pulpit. The Lady Chapel dates to 1623 and houses the organ built by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1866 while the altar serves as a memorial to those who died in World War I; set in the top of the altar is a marble slab with consecration crosses. A more recent addition to the chapel is the statue of the Suffering Madonna and Christ Child carved by Eric Collingwood, a member of the congregation.Chance, p. 3 Churchyard Statue of Francis of Assisi with the Wolf of Gubbio The churchyard is in two sections: the older and original section lying around the church itself and containing many old graves while the newer section is reached through a gate at the top of the old churchyard. In the old section is a grave supposed to be of Salvation Yeo, a character in Charles Kingsley's Westward Ho! who is tortured by the Inquisition. Another is of Benjamin Rogers, a soldier of the Napoleonic Wars who fought against Napoleon in several battles and then guarded him as a prisoner on Saint Helena before returning to Northam where he died aged 90.

She was the first woman to become a lawyer in Honduras and the first woman to serve as Secretary of the Ministry of Labor. Throughout her career, she worked for legal reforms to help children, families, women and the working classes, pressing for educational reform and providing pro bono legal aid. She was one of the driving forces who established the Transition Commission to evaluate corruption in educational institutions and led the Transparency and Ethics Commission in the development of transparency policies for the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). Twelve years after the conclusion of their reforms, in 2017 Alonso was recognized with an honorary doctorate from UNAH and the academic year of 2017 was dedicated to her by the Ministry of Culture. Early life Alba Alonso Cleaves was born in 1924 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras to Cecilia de Jes√∫s Cleaves and Agust√≠n Alonzo. After completing her primary schooling at the Escuela Rep√∫blica del Paraguay in Tegucigalpa, she attended the Normal School for Young Women, also in the capital, graduating with a license to teach. With a group of friends, who sought professional careers in law, medicine and pharmacy, she entered the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). In 1946, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in Legal Sciences from the law faculty of the UNAH, but was not allowed to practice, as at the time, women were not considered citizens in Honduras and the profession was only open to men. The inability to be able to practice as an attorney, led her to the women's movement and the press for legal reform to protect the rights of women and families. Joining the Federaci√≥n de las Asociaciones Femeninas de Honduras (FAFH) (Federation of the Feminine Associations of Honduras), upon its founding in 1951, Alonso traveled the country with prominent women such as Alejandrina Berm√∫dez de Villeda and Regina Mendoza de Martin to educate women on their civic duties and rights. They established branches of FAFH in all the departments of the country and began a petition drive to grant rights to women, which was submitted to the legislature in 1952. Though it failed, two years later, the group submitted a second petition which passed. In 1955, women who were able to read were granted the right to vote and citizenship, FAFH members established in the capital the local branch of the Inter-American Commission of Women (). Victoria Buchard was appointed as the Honduran delegate to the international body and Alonso was selected as the local group's secretary. CIM, in coordination with FAFH established the School of Social Services in 1957 and the following year pressed for creation of the National Board of Social Welfare. Both organizations were designed to allow women to participate in the political processes of social services offered to the nation. Career As soon as women were granted agency, Alonso immediately returned to school to become a trial lawyer (abogado) and contract law specialist (notario), gaining the right to practice law in 1958. She married Arturo Quesada Galindo, an engineer, who would become rector of UNAH from 1963 to 1969. The couple would have three children: Rosa Mar√≠a, Roberto Arturo, and Mar√≠a Guadalupe. Alonso began her career working with marginalized women in the urban neighborhoods of Tegucigalpa, practicing family law. Often giving free legal aid, she pressed for legislation to protect the rights of children, families and women. In 1962, after the first military coup d'√©tat, she was appointed as Secretary of the Ministry of Labor by President Ram√≥n Villeda Morales, the first time a woman had held the post. When Villeda was ousted by a second coup, she was appointed in 1964 as the Secretary of the Office of Culture, Tourism and Information by President Oswaldo L√≥pez Arellano. In 1972, Alonso was serving as the Chief of the Educational Reform Commission in Honduras and pressed for national reforms to ensure access to education for women. She published Towards a Cultural Policy for Honduras in 1977, evaluating cultural and legal developments in the country from pre- colonial times to the 1970s and helped to draft legislation to protect cultural heritage. Among the public positions she held through her career were prosecutor in the Criminal Court, undersecretary of Education, director of the Department of Educational Planning for the Ministry of Education, and legal advisor to the Ministry of Culture, among others. She was instrumental in drafting numerous laws, including revisions to the Family Code, the law to address HIV/AIDs, the Law for the Alternative Development of Non-Formal Education, and the Law for the Institute for Children and the Family. In 1994, Alonso led the efforts to eliminate gender biases in legal terminology and in 1998, helped establish the National Institute for Women, an office which regulates and promotes the human rights of women. In 2000, Alonso was one of the drafters of the Equality and Opportunities Law, which was presented to the legislature by Norma Marina Garc√≠a and Soad Salom√≥n de Facusse and after passage formalized the legal basis for women and men's equality, and created target quotas for women at all political levels of governance. She also served as director of the legal services office of FAFH for many years. As a member of the Transition Board of UNAH, Alonso worked with the team of lawyers to bring transparency to the management of the university, and was instrumental in pushing the legislature to pass the Organic Law of the University in 2004. Working with Norma Cecilia Mart√≠n de Reyes, Alonso led the Transparency and Ethics Commission, which uncovered corruption at the university, identifying over 100 bank accounts in use at the time, as well as secret policies to protect those in power. Between 2005 and 2008, the Transitional Commission evaluated staff and administration, academic standards, and governance regulations, drafting new rules for the university structure at every level. They drafted university policyto protect the autonomy and secularism of the university, as well as the right to public and higher education for all Hondurans. Meeting with the library staff, Alonso was also one of the authors of the Rules and Regulations for Information Resources. In 2017, UNAH declared that the academic year was dedicated in her honor, recognition bestowed since 2008 by the Ministry of Culture to highlight significant figures in Honduras' development. Simultaneously, Alonso was bestowed an honorary degree by UNAH in recognition of her contributions to women's and children's rights, education and the legal profession in the country. In speaking at the presentation ceremony, Alonso reiterated her commitment, at 94 to the global fight to eliminate barriers which cause women to be subordinate and stressed that women needed to continue to fight for their freedom and control of their own bodies and agency.

He was one of two sons for whom their father had great expectations, and the family situation was very tense. In 1945 his father committed suicide, which hit the young Balcar hard. He studied at the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague, which was cancelled and Balcar had to move to the studio of Franti≈°ek Muzika. He finished his studies in 1953 and at the end of his short life, he often travelled abroad, especially to the United States of America. He died in a car accident in Prague in 1968.  Work  Balcar's work began during high school when he worked with a dry needle technique. In the early 1950s, he began to incorporate typography into his works, which later became his typical style. The end of his work came after visits to foreign exhibitions, especially the World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958. He then turned to European trends and became one of the pioneers of the new wave of Czech abstract painting in the late 1950s. At the beginning of the 1960s, he created abstract paintings, graphics and drawings with typographic and handwritten signs as symbols of the unpredictability of everyday reality. The theme of a modern person participating in social life is an essential part of his work. In the following years Balcar reduces further to monochrome, dark images with pasty applied colour.

The cards, either a Skat pack of 32 or a single Romm√© pack of 52 cards, are shuffled and placed face down as a stock in front of the player. The top four cards are picked up and placed face up on the table in a tableau the shape of a rectangle.

The narrative focuses on the relationship between two of them, Diya and Min-seo. It addresses topics such as child abuse and homophobia, but its tone is generally upbeat. For the story, which takes place in Oakland, California, Lei drew on her own experience growing up in a similar neighborhood among many other Asian- Americans. While the player may make choices in the narrative, these do not influence the outcome of the story. Gameplay A point and click section in Butterfly Soup. Butterfly Soup is a visual novel, and, as such, its gameplay has a low level of interactivity and consists of scenes with static two- dimensional images of characters in a first-person perspective. The game's plot alternates its focus between four major protagonists; any decisions made by the player are followed through from the point of view of whichever character is in the spotlight. Occasionally there are gameplay sections that consist of clicking through different locations or on various objects.  Development  Lei was inspired by various sports anime such as Haikyu!! and Free!. Through this she came up with an idea for a \\"baseball yuri\\" game. The game was built over two and half years in Ren'Py, with the art made in Photoshop and Illustrator and the audio edited with Audacity. The characters were designed to be polar opposites of one another so they would create interesting scenarios. The game was intended to be much larger, spanning the entirety of the characters' freshman year, but the length was cut in half due to the scope being too large to reasonably accomplish.  Reception  Butterfly Soup was among the visual novels of 2017 most popular among players and critics. Rock, Paper, Shotgun described it as \\"an insta-hit, and (...) a contemporary classic\\". It was named the \\"best visual novel\\" of 2017 by PC Gamer and was the subject of an exhibition at the Game Developers Conference.  Distribution  The game is available in English, Polish, Tamil, Czech, Chinese, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean for the Windows, Mac and Linux platforms.https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup It is distributed via itch.io, which allows the buyer to name their own price. , Lei intended to make a sequel.

It was directed by Songyos Sugmakanan, and was originally broadcast from 14 September to 10 November 2018. The story revolves around an extended Thai Chinese family whose members' seemingly happy relationships devolve into conflict following murder of the eldest son and head of the family business. The series features a large ensemble cast of veteran actors, including Nappon Gomarachun, Patravadi Mejudhon, Songsit Roongnophakunsri, Saksit Tangthong, Kathaleeya McIntosh, Sopitnapa Choompanee and Kejmanee Wattanasin, as well as members of the pop idol group Nine by Nine.  Plot  The Jiraanan family is a wealthy ethnic Chinese business family, whose extended family spans three generations. Grandfather (A-gong) and Grandmother (A-ma) have four children. Prasoet, the eldest son, heads the family business, Jirananta Hotel, and manages its main Bangkok location, while Phatson, the only daughter, manages its Pattaya branch. Met, the second son, is a single stay-at-home parent, while the youngest son Konkan lives a playboy lifestyle. Among them (and a deceased fifth sibling), they have nine third-generation children. The family members seem to get along well as they celebrate A-gong's birthday, but when he dies of old age shortly after, and his will is revealed to exclude Phatson from inheritance of the hotel, she gets into an argument with Prasoet regarding its management. Prasoet is then found dead from a gunshot in his bedroom, and Phatson becomes a prime suspect. Prasoet's wife Chris also becomes suspected when it is revealed that Prasoet had been seeing a mistress for twenty years. The grandchildren, especially Prasoet and Chris's son Pete and Phatson's eldest son Yi, become involved as each family tries to prove their innocence and uncover the mystery of the case.

(Its nine members play the grandsons in the series.) 4Nologue CEO Anuwat Wichiennarat approached Songyos with the project, and Songyos agreed to produce the series, initially intending to invite one of the directors from his 2017 series Project S to join. As the project progressed, however, its ambition increased in scale, and Songyos decided to direct the series himself. Songyos hoped to target a wider audience than the teen and young adult demographic which his previous work catered to, and proposed the series to Takonkiet Viravan, One 31's CEO, asking for the evening prime time slot. Inspired by 1980s Hong Kong television dramas and their cutthroat family storylines, he and the writing team developed the story around an ethnic Chinese family with generational conflicts over traditional values. He enlisted a large cast of veteran adult actors, who helped anchor the story and give it a broader appeal. Songyos noted that the story did not have a main protagonist, and that all twenty-five characters were equally important, even though their airtime inevitably differed. He also said of the story that it was first and foremost about family, and that the murder mystery was a secondary element. A blessing ceremony, marking the start of the series' production, was held on 21 March 2018. Filming commenced around May, and finished in August. The score was composed by Terdsak Janpan and recorded with a full-size orchestra, conducted by Trisdee na Patalung. The series was officially announced at a press event on 5 September.  Release and reception  Part of the series' cast, together with director Songyos and executives Anuwat and Takonkiet, at the press event on 5 September 2018 In Family We Trust was originally slated to be broadcast on channel One 31 during 21:15‚Äì22:45 on Saturdays, beginning on 1 September, but the schedule was later changed to twice weekly, 20:45 on Fridays and 20:10 on Saturdays. The first episode was released on 14 September. In addition to the TV broadcast, each episode is released to the free Line TV streaming service at 22:00 on the same day. The series received hugely enthusiastic responses online, becoming widely discussed on social media. The premiere inspired extensive discussions regarding Chinese Thai culture, and many commented on the story's parallels to real-life familial disputes such as that of the Thammawattana family, whose scion Hangthong's mysterious death in 1999 became a national sensation. However, TV viewership figures were comparatively poor. The premiere received Nielsen ratings of 0.802, a drop from the 1.2 averaged by MX Muay Xtreme, the Muay Thai programme which previously occupied the time slot, and trailed far behind the dramas of mainstream Channel 3 and Channel 7, which received ratings of 5.627 and 5.349, respectively. Subsequent weekly ratings gradually increased (to 1.290 for the sixth episode), but were still disappointing for its scale of production. The series' poor television performance has been attributed to its younger viewership (compared to the usual mainstream television audience), who preferred to watch through online over-the-top services rather than on traditional live television.

It also goes under the name Thirteens.  Rules  A standard French deck of 52 playing cards is shuffled and placed face down as a stock on the table. The top ten cards are dealt face-up in a row on the table as the starting layout. Pairs of cards adding up to 13 points, regardless of their suit are removed and placed to one side. The card values of the pip cards correspond to their face value. In addition, the Ace scores one, the Jack eleven, the Queen twelve and the King thirteen. Individual Kings, which are the only cards with a value of 13, may be removed on their own. The resulting gaps are filled with new cards from the stock. * Example: In the following layout the single King and the pairs 8+5, 10+3 and Jack (11)+2 can be removed. {border=\\"1\\"  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px  50px } The game ends when the stock is exhausted. If all the cards have been removed, the patience has been solved, if not, the player has lost.  Variations  Thirteens is similar to another German patience, Eight Cards (Acht Karten), in which eight cards are laid out and pairs and individual cards totalling 11 points are removed,. It is also closely related to the more difficult to complete English patience game Baroness (alternatively called Five Piles). This plays in the same way, by removing cards totalling 13 points, but has a starting layout of just five cards, and where five cards are dealt at a time from the stock.

Family and early life  Mabel Lee Hankey was born Mabel Emily Hobson, the fourth child of the artists Henry Edrington Hobson (1819-1881) and Ada Vinson Hardy (1829-1911). She was one of the third generation of artists in the family; both her grandfathers, Henry Hobson and James Hardy, were also artists. Mabel's siblings were also employed as artists: Henry Hope Hobson as a draftsman, Amy Elizabeth Hobson as a portrait painter, and Cecil James Hobson also as a painter of miniature portraits in watercolour.  Marriage  In 1896 Hobson married William Lee Hankey (1869-1952), an artist who worked on book illustrations, character studies, landscapes, and pastoral scenes. After changing her name to Mabel Lee Hankey, she was listed variously under Lee Hankey, Lee-Hankey, or Hankey in catalogues. The marriage ended in divorce after 21 years, and thereafter Hankey used the name Mabel Emily Hankey.  Career  Mabel Lee Hankey exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Miniature Society, the Royal Society of British Artists and the Society of Women Artists from 1889 to 1897 under her maiden name (Mabel Emily Hobson), and again from 1898-1914 under the name Mabel Lee Hankey. She exhibited over 70 miniature portraits, mainly of women or children, at the Royal Academy. She painted widely for aristocratic families, but is perhaps best known for her portraits of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. In 1905, Lady Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne commissioned a watercolour miniature portrait of her daughter, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, later Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, which Hankey exhibited at the Royal Academy and is now in the Royal Collection. Hankey went on to paint Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon a number of times from childhood to adulthood and also her brother, David Bowes-Lyon, in 1916. In a portrait of Lady Elizabeth painted in 1909, she wears a dress made by her mother, Lady Strathmore, based on a gown in a painting by Vel√°zquez. Sir Roy Strong wrote about the portrait: \\"...there is never any doubt that the sitter has no element of hesitation or shyness in her relationship with portrait painters. The lustrous blue-grey eyes entrance the onlooker, the winsome tilt of the head already exudes that famous abundant charm, an attribute which is mentioned by every artist who has written any account of a sitting\\". In 1923 Lady Strathmore commissioned a miniature portrait of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon wearing an evening dress; the painting was framed in gold and silver set with sapphires, with a jeweled crown at the top. On 23 February 1923 Lady Elizabeth wrote in her diary that a \\"horrible photographer\\" had been lying in wait for her when she went for a sitting to Mabel Hankey. The portrait was a wedding gift to Prince Albert, Duke of York on his marriage to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 The painting is kept on the writing desk of Queen Elizabeth II in her private sitting room at Windsor Castle.

Watercolour by Mabel Emily Lee Hankey.jpgLady Wimborne, n√©e Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (1905) Towards the end of 1939, Queen Elizabeth commissioned Mabel Lee Hankey to paint her portrait in watercolour, possibly as a means of providing some financial support; a memorandum written by the Queen stipulated that Mabel should be paid in advance for the portrait. At the beginning of the Second World War Mabel Lee Hankey moved from London to Storrington, Sussex (at \\"Fleurbaix in North Lane). In 1942 Queen Elizabeth commissioned portraits of the Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, and another portrait of herself. The paintings were completed by Mabel Lee Hankey shortly before she died on 5 January 1943.

She was the editor and publisher of The Pioneer, the first women‚Äôs suffrage journal in the West Coast of the United States, and was a co-founder of the California Woman Suffrage Association. In addition, she was a businesswoman, teacher, administrator, lecturer, and a founder of women's organizations. In San Francisco, Stevens started an evening school for working girls, and instituted the Seaman's League. After the organization of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in California, she labored on its behalf. She also contributed to the columns of various newspapers, and lectured. Early years Emily A. Pitts was born in New York in 1841. Career Stevens removed to San Francisco, in 1865, where she started a popular and successful evening school for working girls, by permission of the superintendent of the city schools. During the first year, the number of students grew to 150. Stevens purchased the California Sunday Mercury and re-purposed it to be the first written suffrage periodical in the Pacific states. Serving as editor and publisher, she renamed it multiple times, the last being The Pioneer, a woman's paper produced entirely by women, on the basis of equal pay for equal work. This paper sought equal justice for Laura Fair, who was standing trial on a charge of killing her lover. During the period of 1865 to 1870, she was associated with the all-woman Women‚Äôs Cooperative Printing Union, and was the founder of the Woman‚Äôs Publishing Company. She was aided by prominent men in placing the stock of the company, and through it, she exercised great influence in advancing the cause of woman in California. Ill-health forced her to suspend the paper. Sketch of Stevens, \\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\\", 1884. Stevens was a gifted orator, and known throughout California as an earnest temperance worker. She led in the defeat of the \\"Holland bill\\", which dealt with licensed prostitution in California. She lectured for three years for the Good Templars and was for two years grand vice-templar, always maintaining a full treasury and increasing the membership. In 1874, she was elected Grand Conductor of the California Grand Lodge of the Sons of Temperance. After the organization of the WCTU in California, she labored earnestly in that society. She contributed to the columns of the Bulletin, Pharos, and Pacific Ensign, and served as State lecturer. She joined the Prohibition Party in 1882, and she led the movement, in 1888, to induce the WCTU to endorse that party. In 1890, Steven attended the national WCTU convention in Atlanta as a delegate, and became one of the national organizers. In the following year, at the request of the president of the Nevada WCTU, Stevens was detailed for work in that state, and left San Francisco, early in May. Beginning in Reno, she spent 44 days in Nevada. During this time, she traveled 1,000 miles, much of it through desert and sparsely populated locales. Owing to the peculiar conditions in the state, Stevens was sometimes obliged to pay for the user of a church and where no Unions existed, she had hotel bills, railroad, and hotel expenses. Stevens gave 44 addresses; fourteen women's and ten children's meetings were held; six Unions were visited and helped, and five Unions were organized. Stevens was active in the benevolent work done in the Silver Star House, in sewing-schools and in various societies. In 1874, she instituted the Seamen's League in San Francisco, with her husband as president and herself an officer. In 1875, the old seamen's hospital was donated by Congress to carry on the work, and the institution became firmly established. Personal life Stevens was a member of the Presbyterian Church. She married railroad secretary Augustus A. Stevens, before 1870. In 1872, the San Francisco Chronicle made an implied comment that Stevens had been married previously, ergo her maiden name may not have been Pitts. She died 13 September 1906, age 65, from a cerebral hemorrhage.

The complex consisted of two wildfire complexes which later merged into a single fire: the Spur Peak Fire and the Tripod Fire. Both were caused by lightning strikes. The Tripod Complex burned a total area of , making it one of the largest wildfires in Washington history at the time. Events Prolonged hot and dry weather, combined with an outbreak of mountain pine beetles and a large number of thunderstorms made the 2006 wildfire season of the most severe in Washington state history. The 2006 Pacific Northwest wildfire season began in late June, when an extended thunderstorm followed a three-day heat wave. Between June 27 and July 10, lightning strikes occurred almost daily. Lightning ignited several wildfires during this period‚Äîincluding the Spur Peak Fire, which was first reported on July 3. Located in the Okanogan National Forest, the fire was deemed fully contained by July 14. A second thunderstorm in late July set off another round of wildfire activity in the region. On July 24, a new fire burning just south of the Spur Peak Fire was reported: the Tripod Fire. Smokejumpers from the North Cascades Smokejumpers base in nearby Winthrop, Washington‚Äî from the point of ignition‚Äîwere quickly dispatched to the fire. Despite early containment efforts, low humidity and gusty winds allowed the Tripod Fire to grow rapidly. The extreme fire weather also re-intensified the previously contained Spur Peak Fire, which crossed control lines on July 27. The two fires converged in late August. In mid-August, a battalion of 550 United States Army soldiers were deployed to fight the Tripod Complex Fire.

The lime mudstones, grainstones and limestones of the formation were deposited in lagoonal and reefal environments. Fossils of groups of invertebrates and theropod and sauropod tracks have been found in the formation.Tsiandro tracksite at Fossilworks.org The Sahalaly River tracksite yielded a single trackway belonging to a quadrupedal dinosaur, possibly a sauropod.Wagensommer et al., 2010, p.127 Sauropod tracks are rare, making up as little as 1 percent of the present sample. The best-preserved tracks are assigned to the ichnogenus Kayentapus.Wagensommer et al., 2012, p.124  Description  Middle Jurassic (170 Ma) The limestones of the Bemaraha Formation have been interpreted as a coastal barrier/lagoon complex of Middle Jurassic age (Bajocian, about 170 Ma). At that time, Madagascar had already separated from Africa, but was still attached to India and Antarctica. Since Antarctica was connected to southern Africa, a land bridge really existed between Madagascar and all major southern hemisphere landmasses. Faunal exchanges were possible and endemism was probably very low. Madagascar was to become an island only some 80-90 million years later, during the Late Cretaceous. During Bajocian times, a narrow seaway stretched between eastern Africa and western Madagascar, much in the same position as today's Mozambique Channel. Along the shores of western Madagascar, coral reefs separated wide lagoons from the open sea. The remnants of this reef/lagoon complex is what today, after the coastline shifted several tens of kilometers westward, is seen in the limestones of the Bemaraha Formation. The Bemaraha limestones stretches over an area of roughly ,Wagensommer et al., 2012, p.111 and are best exposed in the area between the towns of Bekopaka and Antsalova, in the northern half of the Morondava Basin. The outcropping limestones can roughly be divided into a western and an eastern belt with different facies. In the western belt, the formation mainly consists of massive limestones with metre-scale bedding or no recognizable bedding at all. Oolites and fossils of reefal organisms (mainly corals) are common in places. This region is affected by the spectacular karst features known as \\"tsingy\\" and for this reason most of the area is part of the Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park, included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list. The facies in the eastern belt is made up mainly of fine-grained and well-bedded limestones with the average thickness of the individual beds being a few tens of centimeters. Beds are often laminated and invertebrate fossils (gastropods, bivalves, brachiopods, echinoids and isolated coral fragments) are common in some beds, while others are devoid of fossils.D'Orazi Porchetti et al., 2010, p.8 In the south-western Majunga Basin, interbedded limestones and mudstones (shales and marls) above the Aalenian Sandstone were attributed to a Bajocian carbonate platform formed by the Bemaraha Formation. The carbonate platform at the Manambolo and Tsiribihina River gorges, which cut through the Bemaraha plateau, are likewise assigned to the Early Bajocian. At the eastern margin of the Bemaraha Plateau, the carbonate succession directly rests on Isalo sandstones. Farther south at Besabora (along National Road RN35), limestones with the foraminifera Mesoendothyra croatica and Protopeneroplis striata support a Middle Jurassic (Bajocian to Early Bathonian) age.Geiger & Schweigert, 2005, p.5  See also  * List of stratigraphic units with dinosaur tracks ** List of stratigraphic units with theropod tracks ** List of stratigraphic units with sauropodomorph tracks * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Madagascar * Geology of Madagascar * Isalo III Formation * Kandreho Formation * Etjo Sandstone  References  = Bibliography =  * Geologic formations of Madagascar Jurassic System of Africa Middle Jurassic Africa Jurassic Madagascar Bajocian Stage Bathonian Stage Mudstone formations Limestone formations Lagoonal deposits Reef deposits Ichnofossiliferous formations Paleontology in Madagascar Formations ","title":"Bemaraha Formation"},{"id":"58362857","text":"Arhopala sophrosyne is a butterfly in the family Lycaenidae.

Some of her poetry appeared in The ballad poetry of Ireland (1869), a collection of verse edited by Charles Gavan Duffy. Life Mary Downing was born Mary McCarthy around 1815 in Kilfadda More, Kilgarvan, County Kerry. She was the eldest daughter of Daniel McCarthy, Esq. Over her life time, she used a number of pen names but is best known as \\"Christabel\\" as well as \\"Myrrha\\". It was under these names that a large amount of her verse was published in the Cork Southern Reporter and the Freeholder. Under the names \\"M.F.D.\\" and \\"C**l\\" she contributed several poems to the Dublin Citizen. Her best known work, Scraps from the mountains, and other poems was published in 1840 in Dublin. She married Washington Downing (d. 1877) of Kenmare in the 1830s. He was the parliamentary reporter for the Daily News, so the couple moved to London. Washington's brother was Timothy McCarthy Downing. Her daughter Helena Shearer was a famous suffragette. Downing was a dedicated nationalist, and helped a number of the participants of the failed Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 escape to France. Her father remained at the family home in Kilfadda More, and in September 1848 James Stephens and Michael Doheny sheltered there while they planned their escape from Ireland. Doheny escaped on a ship bound for Bristol as a cleric. Initially, it was suggested that Stephens could pose as Downing's maid as he was so young and could have passed for a woman. Stephens refused to take part in this plan, and instead travelled with Downing on the Sabarina posing as her servant boy. Stephens hid at the Downings home in London before travelling on to France. When he returned to the United Kingdom in 1856, he passed through their house again. The Downings lived at a number of London addresses, including Pentonville, Cumming Street, and lastly Hilldrop Crescent, Camden Town where she was living in 1871. Downing died in 1881, in London. Papers relating to Downing are held as part of the McCarthy papers in the National Library of Ireland. The bicentenary of her birth was celebrated in Kilgarvan, County Kerry.

It was owned and operated by the Lehigh Valley Railroad. It connected the borough of Flemington, New Jersey, with the Lehigh Valley's main line. It was opened in 1884 and abandoned in 1982.  History  The Lehigh Valley Railroad, via its Easton and Amboy Railroad subsidiary, extended its main line east from Easton, Pennsylvania, to Jersey City, New Jersey, between 1872‚Äì1875. The extension officially opened on June 28, 1875. The line bypassed Flemington proper; trains served the community at Flemington Junction, roughly to the north. Two railroads, the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Pennsylvania Railroad, already had stations in Flemington. The Lehigh Valley had contemplated building a branch to Flemington since 1876, but work did not begin until 1883. A source of some controversy within Flemington was the proposed location of the station, as the two existing stations were located near each other in the center of the borough. Ultimately the Lehigh Valley selected a site on the north side, about north of the other two stations. The branch opened on August 4, 1884. The Lehigh Valley considered but did not extend the branch to Stockton, New Jersey, on the Delaware River. Passenger service over the branch ended in 1952, replaced by buses. Limited freight service continued. The bankrupt Lehigh Valley was incorporated into Conrail; the Flemington Branch was designated to Conrail as part of the United States Railway Association's \\"Final System Plan\\". The Flemington Branch was one of several dozen lines abandoned by Conrail in the wake of the Staggers Rail Act and Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981, which deregulated many aspects of the railroad industry in the United States. The line was formally abandoned on July 25, 1982.

Located near downtown, it was bordered by West Main Street to the south, Preston Avenue to the north, and 4th street to the east. When it was first populated by African American families in the early nineteenth century, it was called \\"Random Row.\\" George Toole, a local Irish-American resident, began calling it Vinegar Hill to memorialize the Battle of Vinegar Hill. It was incorporated into the city in 1835. Vinegar Hill is remembered now for its invasive urban renewal project begun in 1964 that razed the majority black neighborhood.  African American community  After the Civil War, the neighborhood became a thriving center of Charlottesville's African American community. In the decades when the city remained segregated, black-owned businesses in Vinegar Hill served the needs of Charlottesville's black community and some white customers. Although many of the structures in the neighborhood were rented to the mostly black community by white property owners, more than a quarter of the homes and business properties were black owned. Most Vinegar Hill residents lived without basic amenities like running water, plumbing, or electric. The city of Charlottesville's health council did not feel they had adequate power to enforce the standing city code that required each home to have these amenities in every home, including those in Vinegar Hill.  Razing and redevelopment  In 1965, the entire neighborhood was razed as part of an urban renewal plan initiated in the 1950s. By a margin of 36 votes, the city of Charlottesville voted to raze Vinegar Hill in a referendum. This occurred in a time where the poll tax excluded many black residents from voting. One church, thirty businesses, and 158 families were displaced, almost all African American. Six hundred community members were moved into the Westhaven public housing complex. Families who had lived in stand-alone houses now resided in multi-family complexes. The site remained vacant for well over a decade, and it was not until 1985 that a redevelopment project was put in place and the Omni Hotel and surrounding development installed on the neighborhood's site. Leading up to and following the \\"Unite the Right Rally\\" on August 12, 2017, Vinegar Hill's destruction was a central topic of national coverage of Charlottesville's history. In June 2017, Slate published an opinion on the relationship between Vinegar Hill's destruction and the Robert E. Lee statue in nearby Lee (now Market Street, formerly Emancipation) Park. Just three days after the rally, the website Medium posted a Timeline article about Vinegar Hill, and it was the focus of articles in the New York Times and The Atlantic on August 18.  Memorialization  The names \\"Random Row\\" and \\"Vinegar Hill\\" continue to be used in the area where the neighborhood once stood. Random Row Books operated on West Main Street from 2009 to 2013, when the building was razed to make way for a hotel. Random Row Brewery opened on Preston Avenue in 2016. Vinegar Hill Shopping Center operates on Preston Avenue. There has also been a clothing line named after Vinegar Hill, named Vinegar Hill Vintage. This clothing line is also associated with the Vinegar Hill Magazine which is the only current publication of record with content that covers issues focused on issues that affect African American people in Charlottesville. The Vinegar Hill Theater, a small movie house, operated for 37 years before closing in 2016, and has since that time operated with a variant name and different mission. A historic marker telling a brief history of the neighborhood is mounted on a low wall facing Water Street on the Charlottesville Downtown Mall. In 2011, the City of Charlottesville officially apologized for razing the neighborhood.

Early life  Tilahun Gizaw was born in 1940 in Maychew, Tigray, Ethiopia. He was the son of a wealthy landowner from Tigray who divorced from his mother. His pre-university education was in mission boarding schools in Aqaqi and Addis Ababa, and in the Haile Selassie I Secondary School. His half-sister was Princess Sara Gizaw, the widow of Mekonnen Haile Selassie.  Activism  Tilahun Giza expressed a strong dislike for the royal house. In 1968 he narrowly lost the election for the presidency of the Union of Students of the University of Addis Ababa (USUAA) to Mekonnen Bishaw. The contest was perceived as a struggle between radicalism/commitment to the Ethiopian masses, represented by Tilahun Gizaw and reactionary reformism, represented by Mekonnen. Others, the university leadership included, saw it as a fight between extremism/fanaticism and reason/moderation. Disappointed, Tilahun Gizaw withdrew from the university for one year. Upon his return, he had expanded his knowledge of revolutionary literature and Ethiopia. He was close to the activists during the troubled spring of 1969. In November 1969, whilst he was a third year political science student, Tilahun Gizaw was elected President of the USUAA. He became president in the same month as the ultimate challenge to the regime appeared in the student paper Struggle on the status of, and policy towards, the ethnic diversity of the country. There ensued new waves of unrest in secondary schools all over the country and USUAA submitted ultimata to the government that Ethiopian University Service teachers would be withdrawn unless a number of conditions were met. Anti-government pamphlets were distributed in increasing numbers. There was a change of mood: the writings were more frantic and urgent, with a new rhetoric of violence. Government media did not conceal the fact that the intentions of the students had to be quelled. The university president, Aklilu Habtewold, also conveyed the general feeling of imminent government punishment.  Death and legacy  Tilahun Gizaw was shot while walking outside the campus in the Afencho Ber area. It was commonly believed that he was murdered by the security police. After his death students took his body to the university. Thousands of students all over Addis Ababa came to the main campus to mourn his death. It all ended in tragic confrontation with the guns and bayonets of the Imperial Bodyguard. Gizaw was buried in Maychew, Tigray. His funeral had 500 mourners including his half-sister Princess Sara Gizaw and Ras Mengesha Seyoum. The death of Tilahun Gizaw undoubtedly contributed towards raising the level of political consciousness of the average student and enhanced the feeling of alienation from the regime. The violent crackdown on university students by the Imperial Bodyguard and the lack of response from the Addis Ababa University administration resulted in the ejection from the country of the Dean of the College of Business Administration, Dr. LX Tarpey, and the resignation of the Director of the Peace Corps, Joseph Murphy.

This number could be, for example, a year of birth, but it must not contain a zero. Now four pip cards of different card suits are selected that each have a value of one more than the target number. If, as in the example on the right, the number 1956 is the target, the values 2, 10, 6 and 7 are needed. These cards form the start layout or foundation. After these cards have been laid out, the remaining 48 cards are shuffled and then taken, face down, into the hand as a talon. From this stock, cards are taken one after another and either placed face up on a discard pile or, if they have a card value one more than one of the foundation cards and are of the same suit (in ascending order), they are built onto them. In playing a card from the discard pile, the card beneath also becomes available and may be laid on the foundations. When the talon is exhausted, it is shuffled again and placed back in the hand and the process repeated until the talon has been gone through four times. If, after four passes, all the cards have been placed, the patience has been solved. See also * List of solitaires * Glossary of solitaire  References  ‚ÄùDer Geburtstag‚Äù.

It was one of three films shortlisted to be the Norwegian entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 91st Academy Awards. Filmed in one shot, Blind Spot tells the story of a mother who struggles to come to terms with her daughter's mental illness, revealed to be far worse than she had realized.  Summary  The film opens as Thea leaves a handball practice with a friend. She arrives at home where her mother, Marie, is putting her younger brother to bed. Thea makes a phone call to her father, Anders, but he does not answer. She then enters her bedroom, makes an entry to her diary, and jumps out the window (which is on the 4th floor of an apartment building). Marie quickly realizes what has happened and rushes out. She finds Thea badly injured from the fall and screams for help. Her father and mother in law, Hasse and Mona, happen to be close by and come to her aid. An ambulance arrives, and Marie and Hasse follow Thea to the hospital. At the hospital, Marie and Hasse are greeted by Martin, a nurse who specializes in care for patient's relatives. Anders soon arrives and hysterically demands to see his daughter. Marie and Anders are allowed to see Thea as the trauma team operates on her, but Anders passes out at the sight. Marie, Anders and Hasse are placed in a room and wait for the trauma surgeon to give a report on Thea's condition. Martin, reading from Thea's medical record, realizes that Marie is her adoptive mother, and that her biological mother committed suicide. When asked about this, Anders and Marie insist that Thea had been treated by a psychologist and that she has shown no signs of depression or suicidal tendencies. The trauma surgeon gives his report and breaks the news that they are uncertain if they will be able to save Thea's life. Marie, unable to remain in the hospital, decides to go home and wait. Back at home, she enters Thea's bedroom and looks through her belongings. She finds the diary and breaks down after reading it. She lays down in Thea's bed crying and the film cuts to black.

History  The goal of the open innovation program is the advancement of the continuous exchange between industry and research institutes in the area of technologies for unmanned aerial vehicles. In 2010 research studies were launched at the academic partner institutes at Technical University of Chemnitz and Technical University of Munich, the Bundeswehr University Munich , the technical university Ingolstadt and at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) at Braunschweig and Oberpfaffenhofen. All partners designed and built unmanned research aircraft to demonstrate technologies out of the research programme. The first flight took place 5 July 2017 at the Denel Overberg Test Range in South Africa.  Development  All subsystems were developed and built by partners. Final integration and testing took place at the military aircraft centre of Airbus in Manching, Bavaria, Germany.  Design  The unmanned aircraft has a wingspan and length of approximately 3,00m and a maximum mass of 150 kg. It is powered by two BF-300F jet engines from BF Turbines with 300 N thrust each. It offers space for several experiments. The pitch, roll and yaw control surfaces are actuated by electric actuators (fly-by-wire). The landing gear is retracted electrically. The flight control system consist of a flight control computer, a navigation unit (differential GPS and INS) and an air data system. A mission computer is installed to manage and execute mission tasks. The flight and the mission are controlled by a ground control station. The aircraft communicates via multiple data links. Flights are fully automatic, including take-off and landing (ATOL).

There is no proof that massacres of Muslims committed by Chetniks were a direct consequence of Moljevic's tract, bearing in mind the fragmented and very weak command structure of Mihailoviƒá which militated against any systematic annihilation programme.

Description of the gall The gall is found on the underside of a leaf of the host plant. It is egg shaped when young, becomes globular as it matures, has brown warts and is usually hairless. It can have a diameter of up to 5 mm and can have a red tinge. On the upperside of the leaf there is a brownish circular depression. The galls can be found on the leaves of osier (Salix viminalis) and purple willow (Salix purpurea). Distribution This species is found in most of south and central Europe north to southern Sweden. It is common in Great Britain and Ireland. Inquilines and predators Three weevils have been found living in the galls, Melanapion mininum, Archarias crux and A. salicivorus. The larva of the chalcid wasp, Eurytoma aciculata lives in the gall and kills the sawfly larvae. The tortricid moth, Gypsonoma dealbana usually feeds on various parts of willow but have been found inside the gall, killing the larvae.

It had been previously considered a form of silvery lutung. Roos and colleagues elevated this population to a subspecies level, Trachypithecus cristatus selangorensis, in 2008. It has since come to be regarded by primatologists as a separate species, Trachypithecus selangorensis. Description The Selangor silvered langur has a gray body with a black face and black feet and hands. The type specimen had a head and body length of and a tail that was long. The closely related silvery lutung has an average head and body length of for females and for males. The silvery lutung has an average weight of for females and for males. The Selangor silvered langur differs from the silvery lutung in the shape of its whiskers. The Selangor silvered langur has long, straight whiskers while the silvery lutung has mussel-shaped whiskers. The two species also differ genetically. Infants are born with a very different color pattern than the adults. They have bright orange fur with white faces, hands and feet. The infant coloration transforms to the adult coloration over its first 3 to 5 months, starting with the head, hands and feet. All members of the group participate in the care of the infants, including females other than the mother and the dominant male. One theory for the reason for the orange infant coloration is that it may attract other females to help look after the infant. Distribution This langur's distribution is restricted to the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia in Johor, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, Melaka, Perak and Kedah. It is arboreal and prefers mangrove and riparian forests, but is also sometimes found on plantations. It eats mostly leaves, but also fruit, seeds, flowers and even dried wood. At Bukit Melawati, feeding the Selangor silvered langurs is a popular tourist activity. The Selangor silvered langurs at Bukit Malawati are among the few wild leaf monkey populations to have experienced continual habituation to humans. They will sometimes willingly touch and climb on visitors, in addition to approaching to beg for food. Behavior Like most leaf monkeys, the Selangor silvered langur typically lives in groups with a single adult male and multiple adult females and their juvenile offspring. A study by Sterck and Van Hooff found that it was more likely than most to live in groups with more than one adult male. In some cases, a former dominant male was permitted to stay with the group after a younger male became dominant. In some cases, new young adult males were permitted to join the group without toppling the dominant male. In other cases younger males, presumably sons of the dominant male, were permitted to stay with the group for some time after reaching adulthood. More typically young males are ejected from the group by the dominant male upon reaching adulthood. Similarly aged males tend to leave their natal group together and join new groups together. Groups are territorial, with little overlap between the territories of different groups. A study by Lord Medway indicated that Selangor silvered langur infant births do not show a seasonal pattern Besides feeding and caring for infants, the activity budget of Selangor silvered langurs includes playing, transportation, resting, vocalizing and grooming. Juveniles of both sexes participate in most of the playing and even infants that are only a few weeks old engage in play. Play can include wrestling and other play fighting and juvenile males are the most active participants in this type of play. A study by Bernstein at Bukit Melawati found that much play occurs on the ground and that whenever the group was on the ground and undisturbed the juveniles engaged in play. Monkeys of all ages, including infants and the dominant male, engage in grooming. Grooming sessions typically involve 2 monkeys but sometimes involve 3 or 4. At times of distress the monkeys often embrace each other. A study by Lee Harding observed that when Selangor silvered langurs encounter the smaller long-tailed macaques the langurs generally move away without fighting. On the other hand, Bernstein found that the two monkey species sometimes travel together and even feed in the same trees at times. Conservation status The conservation status of the Selangor silvered langur has not been evaluated since it was identified as a separate taxon. A study by Khan published in 1978, prior this recognition, suggested that the population in West Malaysia had declined from about 6,000 individuals to about 4,000 over the period of 1958 through 1975.

He moved to Asheville, North Carolina in 1906 and became known as the \\"Black Mayor of West Asheville\\" because of his influence in African American neighborhood development and community life.  Early life and education  Pearson was born in Glen Alpine, North Carolina, in Burke County. He completed school through the fourth grade. Interested in mining, he moved to Jellico, Tennessee, where he enlisted in the Army. He served as a Buffalo Soldier (9th Cavalry Troop B) from 1893-1898 in Fort Robinson, Nebraska during the Spanish-American War. After being discharged from the Army, he lived in Chicago, where he supplemented his early formal education by taking correspondence courses on insurance, business, religion, and law, including courses at the Chicago Correspondence School of Law.  Business ventures  Pearson began development of Asheville's Burton Street (then known as Pearson Park) and Park View neighborhoods as African American subdivisions. These neighborhoods have continued to be predominantly African American. He also sold real estate for development in this area as an agent on behalf of developer and librarian Rutherford Platt Hayes, son of President Rutherford B. Hayes. In addition to his real estate ventures, Pearson operated a general store, organized the Mountain City Mutual Insurance Company and ran a mail order shoe business called Piedmont Shoe Company. The general store in West Asheville served as the home base for these operations.  Agricultural fair  Pearson's commitment to improving the lives of African Americans in Asheville also extended to recreational activities and community life. Part of his property in the Burton Street neighborhood included Pearson Park, which he donated to the City of Asheville. In 1914, he organized the Buncombe County and District Colored Agricultural Fair there. One of the largest agricultural fairs in the Southeast, it attracted visitors of all races from all over Western North Carolina and South Carolina, and included amusement park rides, games, livestock shows, and cash prize competitions in categories ranging from baked goods to flower arrangement. It was held annually until 1947, a year after Pearson's death, and later revived as the Burton Street Agricultural Fair.  Baseball  In 1916, Pearson formed the Asheville Royal Giants, Asheville's first black semi-professional baseball team. The Royal Giants played at Oates Park on Asheville's south side and sometimes at Pearson Park. Baseball was not a full-time career for his players, many of whom held jobs at Biltmore Estate, on trains, or in hotels like the Grove Park Inn, Battery Park Hotel, and the former George Vanderbilt Hotel. In 1921, Pearson also founded and became president of the Blue Ridge Colored Baseball League.  Other organizations  Pearson was very involved in community organizations. In 1933, he organized and was first president of the Asheville branch of the NAACP. He also served as president of the Asheville chapters of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the North Carolina Negro Improvement Association. Additionally, Pearson was a member of several fraternal groups, including the Odd Fellows, the Knights of Pythias, and the Freemasons, among whom he held the office of Grand Master.  Family  Pearson and his family lived in a home behind the general store he operated in West Asheville. His wife was Annis Bradshaw Pearson. They had two daughters, Iola Pearson Byers and Annette Pearson Cotton, and one son, Edward W. Pearson Jr.  Legacy  Pearson's legacy has been commemorated in Asheville with a community identification sign in 2008 as well as larger-than-life mural painted on the back of Burton Street Community Center in 2014 for the 100th anniversary celebration of the agricultural fair that Pearson first organized in 1914. The fair was revived and renamed the Burton Street Agricultural Fair in 2012.

He was half-brother of Kajetonas Nezabitauskis. After studies at Vilnius University and Vilnius Priest Seminary, Nezabitauskis was ordained as a priest in 1803 and worked as a parish priest in Varniai and Veliuona. After the Uprising of 1831, he fled Tsarist persecutions first to East Prussia and then to France. In 1836, he became director of a school established by Polish √©migr√©s in Nancy, France, but died just a year and half later. In Lithuania, Nezabitauskis joined the Samogitian literary movement (an early predecessor of the Lithuanian National Revival) which supported and promoted the use of the Lithuanian language. He published a translated work on beekeeping, contributed material to a Lithuanian grammar textbook, and began working on a Lithuanian‚ÄìPolish dictionary. It appears that he abandoned the dictionary after the letter K due to losing support from professor and Count Nikolay Rumyantsev. His brother Kajetonas claimed authorship of both the dictionary and the beekeeping work. In exile, Nezabitauskis wrote a collection of 18 epic poetry works plus a modification of a ballad Birutƒó by . This was one of the first political and philosophical poetry works in Lithuanian. The manuscript was discovered in 1909 and first published in 1931. He also translated and published excerpts from works by Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais and Adam Mickiewicz that were very popular among Polish √©migr√©s in France. Biography =In Lithuania= Nezabitauskis was born in near Salantai, Samogitia, then part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, to a family of free peasants. Born as Zabitis, he changed his name to Polish Niezabitowski (signed in Lithuanian as Nezabitowskas) to appear to be from the Lithuanian nobility. He likely purchased baptismal records from a noble and thus his date of birth is often incorrectly recorded as 1774. From 1786 to 1792, he attended Kra≈æiai College (equivalent to secondary school) and then enrolled into Vilnius University. He studied anatomy and natural sciences. After graduating in 1796, he became a student at the Vilnius Priest Seminary where he studied for six years and Varniai Priest Seminary where he spent the 1802/1803 school year. Usually, university graduates were ordained as priests very quickly, but Nezabitauskis had to wait until 1803 ‚Äì the year he turned 24, the minimum age for a priest set by the Council of Trent. After ordination, Nezabitauskis briefly served as the administrator of Varniai parish before transferring as administrator to Jurbarkas parish. From 1806 to 1815, he was parson of Varniai, then the seat of the Diocese of Samogitia. At the same time, from 1808, he was director of the Varniai cathedral school and, from 1811, he was religious representative to the district court in Tel≈°iai. In 1815, Nezabitauskis was reassigned to Veliuona where he was parson until 1831. He continued to be religious representative to courts first in Raseiniai and then, from 1820, in Vilnius. These duties often brought Nezabitauskis to Vilnius where he helped his younger half-brother Kajetonas Nezabitauskis cover education costs at Vilnius University. He became acquainted with a small circle of Samogitian students, including Simonas Staneviƒçius, who promoted the use of the Lithuanian language. In an 1824 letter, Dionizas Po≈°ka suggested establishing a committee on the Lithuanian language and, among others, suggested the Nezabitauskis brothers as its members. =Uprising and exile= During the anti-Russian Uprising of 1831, Nezabitauskis was rather passive and helped the rebels only when threatened. Nevertheless, Russian police decided to confiscate all the property of Nezabitauskis in May 1832 and, fearing an imminent arrest, he fled to Schmalleningken (Smalininkai), then in East Prussia. He wrote letters to , governor of Vilnius, Bishop , and even Frederick William III of Prussia asking for support and clemency. However, a Russian military court sentenced him to death on 28 April 1834 ‚Äì mostly because he fled. His name was added to a list of those whose sentences could be commuted if they voluntarily turned themselves in. Nezabitauskis traveled to Strasbourg where he lived on money received from sympathetic priests who remained in Lithuania. In 1844, three priests were sentenced to exile in Kaluga and Ryazan for providing money to Nezabitauskis. In 1835, Nezabitauskis received an invitation to become director of a school established by Polish √©migr√©s in Nancy, France (see also: Great Emigration). He arrived in January 1836 and worked as director, chaplain, teacher of religion, morality, history, and arithmetic. After five weeks of illness, he died in July 1837. Works =In Lithuania= Nezabitauskis wrote supporting material to a Polish‚ÄìLithuanian grammar for school students written by in 1823. The material took three printing sheets out of 27 total sheets (168 pages in quarto). The grammar received some 700 pre-orders and was read by a number of professors of Vilnius University, however the manuscript was not approved by the Tsarist censors and was lost. Therefore, the content of Nezabitauskis' additions is unknown. In 1823, he translated and published a 75-page booklet on beekeeping from a Polish work by Jan Krzysztof Kluk. The work was dedicated to Count Nikolay Rumyantsev. His brother Kajetonas claimed authorship of this work. It included a quatrain translated by Dionizas Po≈°ka that was also included in Kajetonas' primer. Sometime before 1823, Nezabitauskis began working on a Lithuanian‚ÄìPolish dictionary and collected about 18,000 words. Via professor , he hoped to receive financial support from Count Nikolay Rumyantsev. Loboiko initially supported the effort, but became disappointed with the rather poor lexicographic quality of Nezabitauskis' work and switched his support to Dionizas Po≈°ka who worked on a similar dictionary. It appears that Nezabitauskis abandoned his work (he got up to the letter K) and the manuscript was lost in Warsaw during World War II. His half-brother Kajetonas Nezabitauskis in letters to professor Micha≈Ç Wiszniewski and Simonas Daukantas claimed authorship of the dictionary. While this claim has been rebuked by literary historians, it is still sometimes repeated. =In exile= Nezabitauskis is considered to be one of the first political and philosophical poets in Lithuanian, even if his poetry is not strong. In 1835, he prepared a collection of poetry entitled Eiliavimas lie≈æuvyje lietuvi≈°kai-≈æemaiti≈°kam (Poetry in the Tongue of Lithuanian-Samogitian). The collection, dedicated to Adam Mickiewicz, included 19 epic works, including historical descriptions, fight marches, and elegies. The only non-original work was a slightly modified version of the ballad Birutƒó by . The unpublished 88-page manuscript was discovered by Juozas Gabrys at the Polish Library in Paris in 1909 and was first published in 1931. The poems reflect Nezabitauskis' nostalgia for the homeland and grief for its lost independence, disappointment in world order (including some complaints to God) and a rebellious attitude calling for the liberation of Poland‚ÄìLithuania. Though undated and unsigned, researchers believe that around 1835‚Äì1836 he translated and published two small booklets with excerpts from Paroles d'un croyant (Words of a Believer) by Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais and Modlitwa pielgrzyma (Prayers of Pilgrimage) and Litania pielgrzymska (Litany of Pilgrimage) by Adam Mickiewicz. These works were very popular among Polish √©migr√©s in France. He did not use the original French work by de Lamennais, but a Polish translation by .

He fought off one of the terrorists in the 2017 London Bridge attack, before being killed by other terrorists.  Biography  Ignacio Echeverr√≠a, called Abo, was the third of five children. He was the son of Joaqu√≠n Echeverr√≠a Alonso, an Asturian engineer, and Ana Miralles de Imperial Hornedo, a lawyer. Even though he was born in the Hospital General of Ferrol, La Coru√±a (Spain), he was entered in the Civil Register of As Pontes de Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez, a town situated in the northwest of the province. He lived there until the age of 9, when the family moved to Las Rozas de Madrid. Echeverr√≠a grew up in a Catholic home, and was a member of a local group of Catholic Action in Las Rozas. He was fluent in English, French and German, and graduated in law from two universities, the Complutense University and the Sorbonne. He was also fond of skateboarding, surfing, golf and squash. After working in several banks and being unemployed, he decided to move to London, where he secured a position as a money laundering prevention analyst with HSBC.Navalpotro, Jos√© Mar√≠a (2017).

Mundo Cristiano (Madrid) (688-689): PP. 60-62.  Attack and burial  At around 10pm on Saturday 3 June 2017, Echeverr√≠a, carrying his skateboard on his back, was cycling with friends in London. Near Borough Market, they saw a man attacking a police officer lying on the ground. When the man left the body of the officer and began to assault a woman (a French citizen who survived the incident due to Echeverr√≠a's actions) Echeverr√≠a used his skateboard to strike the attacker, diverting his attention long enough that several people were moved to safety. He subsequently attacked a second terrorist who was also attacking a police officer. He was then stabbed twice in the back by two attackers, causing his death. After the attack, several of his relatives left messages on social networks asking for help to locate his body. His sister and niece toured London hospitals looking for him without success. The Spanish Consulate and the Spanish Embassy provided help and support to his sister and family during the search process. The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Alfonso Dastis, expressed his bewilderment at the disappearance of Echeverr√≠a. His father reported that HSBC employed a former police private investigator to help find him. On Wednesday 7 June, British authorities confirmed to his family that Echeverr√≠a had been among the eight victims of the attack. The family identified him the next day and began the process of repatriation. On 10 June his body was transferred to Spain by military airplane and was received with honours by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Mar√≠a Dolores de Cospedal, Minister of Defence, at Torrej√≥n Air Base (Madrid). The body lay in repose in the cemetery of Las Rozas de Madrid, with the Order of Civil Merit Grand Cross which he had been posthumously awarded placed on the coffin. On Sunday 11 June, a funeral mass ceremony was held in Corpus Christi Parish of Las Rozas by Archbishop of Madrid Carlos Osoro Sierra, who had previously officiated a mass to mark the arrival of the coffin in Spain as well as attending the burial.  Reactions  The Town Council of Las Rozas de Madrid, where the Echeverr√≠a family lived, declared a two-day official mourning period and a rally in memory of Echeverr√≠a which was attended by more than 1,000 people, as well as naming the skate park where Echeverr√≠a used to practise after him. The Town Council of As Pontes de Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez convened a demonstration of mourning. The news of his death and the circumstances surrounding it saw significant coverage in both national and international press, with media dubbing him the Skateboard Hero. The Bar Association of Madrid expressed dismay for the murder of a former member and announcing its intention to participate in all tributes in his memory. Spanish singer Joaqu√≠n Sabina dedicated a song to him in a concert that was held after the attack in Ubeda (province of Ja√©n) as well as mentioning him at a concert in London. The spanish Skating Federation awarded him its order of merit and medal. Senior members of the Catholic Church in Spain also praised his example and asked for members to pray for him, including Cardinal-Archbishop of Madrid, who conducted his funeral, and Luis √Ångel de las Heras CMF, the Bishop of Ferrol, his hometown. On 14 June, the Workers' Commissions Trade Union representatives in Endesa issued a statement lamented the murder of Echeverr√≠a and expressing their solidarity with his father, a retired worker of the company. The City Council of Alicante agreed to give his name to the San Juan Beach skate park. Spanish boxer Kerman Lejarraga dedicated his victory in New York to Ignacio Echeverr√≠a. He said \\"this victory is especially dedicated to Ignacio Echeverr√≠a, who died a hero\\". During the Spanish state visit to the United Kingdom in July 2017, Felipe VI mentioned his act of heroism at the reception in the Spanish Embassy as well as in his speeches to both houses of Parliament and at the state banquet in the presence of the Queen. A tribute was held in Comillas (Cantabria), where Echeverr√≠a spent the summer with his family, on 10 August 2017. Dozens of people attended and a sports area with a skate park was dedicated to him. During the military parade of the national day of Spain on 12 October 2017, devoted for the first time to victims of terrorism, Echeverr√≠a received a tribute along with the victims of the Barcelona attacks. His mother accompanied King Felipe during the floral offering with the ambassadors of the countries that had suffered casualties in these attacks and presidents of the Association of Victims of Terrorism and the Foundation of Victims of Terrorism. On 11 October 2018, Echeverr√≠a's parents, alongside Constable Charles Guenigault and Constable Wayne Marques, received the George Medal from the Queen at Buckingham Palace. Constable Leon McLeod was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal at the same investiture ceremony.

It was broadcast weekly on ABC from May 30, 1948, until November 27, 1948. The program was also known as A Johnny Fletcher Mystery. Johnny Fletcher was an amateur detective, \\"something of a scofflaw\\", created by writer Frank Gruber. The character was featured in at least 18 Gruber novels between 1940 and 1964. The film The French Key (1946), which starred Albert Dekker as Fletcher, was based on the Fletcher novel of the same title. Radio historian Jim Cox, in his book, Radio Crime Fighters: Over 300 Programs from the Golden Age, describes Fletcher as \\"inept\\" and \\"frequently drunk\\". The program's plots usually involved murder or other kinds of mayhem that Fletcher and his partner, Sam Kragg, tried to solve. As an example, \\"The Whispering Master\\" episode (previewed in a contemporary newspaper) began with an \\"unidentified but beautiful young woman\\" kissing Fletcher and suddenly departing, leaving behind a popular recording. As the plot unfolded, Fletcher had to solve the murder of the singer who recorded the song. Gruber originally sold the rights to his Fletcher novels to NBC in 1946. An audition recording of Johnny Fletcher Mysteries featured Dekker as Fletcher and Mike Mazurki as Sam. The pilot episode was an adaptation of the novel, The Navy Colt. Two years later, ABC bought the rights to the program from NBC and produced Johnny Fletcher. On the ABC version, Fletcher was portrayed by Bill Goodwin, while Sam was played by Sheldon Leonard. The announcers were Owen James and John Storm. Gruber wrote the scripts, and Buzz Adlam provided the music. Producers were Bill Rousseau and Hal Finberg. The February 20, 1961, issue of the trade magazine Broadcasting included Johnny Fletcher in a list of pilots being prepared for the 1961-1962 season. Gruber was the producer of the episode, which starred Johnny Goddard and Read Morgan.

Then out of nowhere, a man with a rifle barges past them and kills it. Scott and Annie Howard move into their new house in Napa Valley, but its previous owner, deer killer Charlie Peck, becomes obsessed with keeping an eye on the couple. Though Scott is annoyed, Annie feels sorry for him as he had told them his wife died of cancer and that he will soon be moving to Florida to live with his daughter. Scott and Annie have their friend Mike and his wife over for dinner. Mike goes outside for a smoke and senses he is being watched. He throws his cigarette on the ground. The next morning when Mike and his wife are leaving, Mike notices a cigarette burn on the seat of his luxury car that wasn't there previously. Charlie continues to show up unannounced, mowing the lawn and berating workers installing a security system. Mike suspects Charlie and insists that Scott and Annie are being watched. Scott and Annie are unconvinced, so Mike persuades Scott to accompany him behind the house, where they see an unknown vehicle that drives away. Tensions rise between Scott and Annie due to Scott's coldness toward Charlie, and when Annie discovers that Scott met some clients at a bar,it is revealed that before marrying Annie, he had cheated on her with a client at a bar. At the bar, one of the clients kisses Scott, and he realizes that Annie was right to be worried. He returns home immediately but has an argument with Annie. They reconcile after they both wake in the middle of the night from a noise, and have sex on the floor, unaware Charlie is watching. A neighbor reveals to Scott that Charlie's wife killed herself with one of Charlie's shotguns. Scott asks Mike to investigate him. But Charlie has developed an obsession with Annie and begins visiting the home when Scott is gone. One morning, while Scott is out jogging, a truck runs into him from behind, this turns out to be Charlie. While in the hospital, Scott calls Mike to come and see him,when Mike turns up, Scott explains to Mike that Charlie had lived with his wife Ellen and daughter Cassidy, but was deeply in debt and forced to sell the house. Charlie shows up at the house, and Annie invites him inside. Mike goes to check on her and is confronted by Charlie, who declares that he has a chance to get back all that he lost and must get rid of Scott. Charlie kills Mike with an axe. Scott contacts Cassidy, who has changed her name but she hangs up when Scott mentions her father and the house she grew up in. A while later, when Scott is driving home, Cassidy rings back and explains that Charlie killed his wife after she threatened to divorce him and take the house, and she now lives as far away from Charlie as she could get, and if he were ever to show up, she would kill him. Annie discovers Charlie's underground cellar connected to the house, where he has been living and has stored Mike's body. Scott returns home to find Charlie trying to rape Annie, but they fight back and overpower him before seizing his gun with a blow to the head by a baseball bat.

It is only mildly venomous. Description The soil-crack whipsnake is front fanged and average about 49cm in length. They are a slender grey to olive brown, presenting a dark band behind the head and a belly that is bright orange-red. Distribution Soil- crack whipsnakes can be found around Tibooburra and the Sturt National Park in far northwestern New South Wales. Habitat and ecology This snake is mostly diurnal, using flat rocks, fallen timber, debris, rock crevices, deep soil crack, grass clumps and animal burrows for shelter. they prefer biomes of open forests, woodlands or shrubland that have plenty of grass and shrubs to live amongst. they're main food source is small lizards and snakes which they chase and hunt. Conservation The soil-crack whipsnake is a vulnerable animal which faces a few major threats. Grazing and cultivation tend to destroy their habitat, soil cracks and fallen timber. Predation from foxes and cats can also become a major issue and, although they are of least concern, a lack of knowledge and management of these possible threats can quickly cause a decline in numbers. Controlling pests such as goats, foxes and cats can help to stop predation as well as grazing from the goats. To regenerate and retain habitat, stock intensities can be reduced or exclude grazing to help vegetation regrow and cultivation should be restricted around remnant habitats. It is key to retain the grassland they live in which can be achieved by ensuring the full cycle of grass development such as seed setting and tussock formation. Stop the removal of stick and leaf litter, understory shrubs and fallen logs as habitat for the species, other types of habitat to maintain include species of Triodia and any nesting sites or food sources. These strategies are important to boost this species since it is still listed as vulnerable.

The law also foresees subsidies also for private higher education institutions. It is intended to give underprivileged Filipino students a chance to earn a college degree. It is also known as the Republic Act 10931 and has the full title An Act Promoting Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education by Providing for Free Tuition and Other School Fees in State Universities and Colleges, Local Universities and Colleges and State-Run Technical Vocational Institutions, Establishing the Tertiary Education Subsidy and Student Loan Program, Strengthening the Unified Student Financial Assistance System for Tertiary Education and Appropriating Funds Therefor. The law was filed first by senator Ralph Recto, principally sponsored by Senator Bam Aquino, and was signed by Rodrigo Duterte, President of the Philippines, on August 3, 2017. The bill is supported by almost all members of Congress In September 2017, the chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations announced that P40 billion had been gathered and that this amount would finance all expenses foreseen by the law for 2018. On March 26, 2018, the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) released the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) pertaining to the Act. Before the signing of the bill by the President, the government took the view after intense political discussions that \\"the long-term benefits that will be derived from a well-developed tertiary education on the part of the citizenry will definitely outweigh any short-term budgetary challenges\\". The government also stated that the \\"bottom 20 percent\\" was to have priority concerning the allocation of subsidies for educational-related expenses.  Requirements and benefits  To continuously benefit from the law, students must meet all the admission and retention requirements. That is, they need to pass the admission and retention requirements of the universities, which includes finishing their degree on time and enrolling in the required number of units per year. Persons who have already obtained a bachelor's degree or comparable undergraduate degree from any public or private higher education institution are not eligible for free education.Implementing Rules and Regulations, Rule II, Section 6: Exceptions to Free HE. The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) foresee different benefits depending on the type of institution in which the student enrols: * All (eligible) Filipino students enrolled in courses leading to a bachelor's degree in state universities and colleges (SUCs), local universities and colleges (LUCs) and technical-vocational schools will be exempted from paying tuition and other school fees. They are also exempted from admission fees and fees for the use of library, laboratory and computers. For those enrolled in technical-vocational schools, further fees are exempted, including the cost of utilities, facilities, equipment and tools maintenance, as well as the honoraria of trainers. Other school fees that are covered are specified under Sections 4 and 5 of RA 10931 and are further detailed in the Implementing Rules and Regulations.Implementing Rules and Regulations, Rule II, Section 7: Benefits. * For those enrolled in private higher education institutions, a subsidy for tuition and other school fees is available. The law also includes provisions for student loans. According to the IRR, students with financial capacity may opt out of the benefits foreseen by the law.  Transitional measures  * Resolution No. 620 ‚Äì Reimbursements of fees paid for 2018: :In February 2018, the Senate unanimously passed Senate Resolution No. 620 (Adopted Resolution No. 85) which called for the full and immediate implementation of the new law in the second school semester of 2017‚Äì2018. The senator who had sponsored this resolution, Bam Aquino, urged schools to adhere in full to the new law, which was all the more necessary as Filipino families were shouldering rising prices in goods and services due to the passage of the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, and to refund whatever fees they may have continued to collect for that semester. * Free Tuition 2017 program ‚Äì Reimbursements based on an income-based ranking: :The Free Tuition 2017 program allowed SUCs received reimbursement for deserving students already for first semester of academic year 2017‚Äì2018, based on an income- based ranking of the students.

History The museum occupies a former aristocratic residence, the Palazzo Almerici. It houses a collection of Greek bronze statuettes, Ancient Roman art and artifacts, including sculpture, ceramics, and numismatic collection. It also has objects excavated for the 7-8 A.C (pre-Roman) burial at the necropolis of Novilara. Among the most intriguing findings from that site are portions of stelae inscribed with North Picene language and one depicting a sea battle with a Liburna. Also present is the bronze ‚Äútabula fabrorum‚Äù. The museums also have artifacts from the sacred grove of Lucus Pisaurensis and the pre-Roman Votive Stones of Pesaro. The museum includes many Latin epitaphs. It also has a collection of post-Roman medallions. Adjacent to the museum is the Biblioteca Oliveriana, a library founded in the mid-18th century. The idea of a public museum for these artifacts arose with the scholar Giovanni Battista Passeri (1694-1780). Included in his collections were the findings of Annibale degli Abati Olivieri (1708-1789) at the Lucus Pisaurensis. In 1756, the Museo Archeologico Oliveriano was begun, but no open to the public until 1793, displayed in the Palazzo Olivieri-Macchirelli. In 1885, the various collections in possession of the city were brought to this site.Museo Oliveriano website.

His early career was at sea in a variety of vessels involved in the slave trade in the Caribbean and West Africa in the 1760s. He probably met his future business partners Anthony Calvert (1735‚Äì1809) and William Camden at this time when he was master on ships owned by them. He first partnered with them as Camden, Calvert and King for the voyage of the Three Good Friends to St Vincent in 1773 and the firm subsequently made many slaving and trading voyages in which they transported at least 22,000 enslaved persons, mostly from West Africa to the Caribbean. In 1776 he was tried for murder at the Old Bailey in London but acquitted. He was a governor of the Foundling Hospital in London, elected to the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, and one of the founder subscribers of Lloyds of London. King acquired significant wealth and owned a number of estates in British Guiana (now Guyana). He left an estate of ¬£120,000 in 1824. Early life and family The year of King's birth is unknown.

In 1766 he went to Africa as second mate on the Royal Charlotte which was transporting the African company's stores to Cape Coast Castle. The ship took on 120 slaves on the Gold Coast. It was probably during this period that he met his future business partners Anthony Calvert (1735‚Äì1809) and William Camden when he was master on ships owned by them.Cozens, p. 83. He became close friends with Anthony Calvert and named one of his sons Anthony Calvert King.Cozens, p. 32. In 1771, while he was master of the Surrey (or Surry), owned by Anthony Calvert, he was involved in an incident that saw him charged with the murder of a sailor, John Warren, for which he stood trial at the Old Bailey in 1776.

Via St Petersburg, the Russian Empire sent an ultimatum to Vienna warning Austria-Hungary not to attack Serbia. Following the invasion of Serbia, Russia began to mobilize its very large reserve army. Consequently, on July 31, the German Empire in Berlin demanded Russian demobilization. There was no response; hence, on the same day, Germany declared war on Russia. In accordance with its war plan, Germany ignored Russia and moved first against France by declaring war on August 3, and by sending its main armies through Belgium to surround Paris. The threat to France caused Britain to declare war on Germany on August 4. The main belligerents had been established. (The Ottoman Empire soon joined the Central Powers and fought Russia along their border.) Historians researching the causes of World War I have emphasised the role of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Scholarly consensus has typically minimised Russian involvement in the outbreak of this mass conflict. Key elements were Russia's defence of Orthodox Serbia, its pan-Slavic roles, its treaty obligations with France, and its concern with protecting its status as a great power. However, historian Sean McMeekin has emphasised Russian plans to expand its empire southward and to seize Constantinople as an outlet to the Mediterranean Sea. Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by Bosnian Serbs on 28 June 1914 due to Austria- Hungary's annexation of the largely Slavic province. Vienna was unable to find evidence that the Serbian state had sponsored this assassination but, one month later, it issued an ultimatum to Serbia, which it knew would be rejected and thus lead to war. Austria-Hungary deemed Serbia to be deserving of punishment for the assassination. Although Russia had no formal treaty obligation to Serbia, it wanted to control the Balkans, and had a long-term perspective toward gaining a military advantage over Germany and Austria- Hungary. Russia had incentive to delay militarization, and the majority of its leaders wanted to avoid war. However, Russia had the support of France and feared that a failure to defend Serbia would lead to the loss of Russian credibility, constituting a major political defeat in its goal of controlling the Balkans.Jack S. Levy, and William Mulligan, \\"Shifting power, preventive logic, and the response of the target: Germany, Russia, and the First World War.\\" Journal of Strategic Studies 40.5 (2017): 731-769. Tsar Nicholas II mobilized Russian forces on 30 July 1914 to threaten Austria-Hungary if it invaded Serbia. Christopher Clark stated: \\"The Russian general mobilisation [of 30 July] was one of the most momentous decisions of the July crisis\\". The first general mobilization occurred before the German government had declared a state of impending war.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2013 p 509. Germany felt threatened by Russia, responding with its own mobilization and a declaration of war on 1 August 1914. At the outset of hostilities, Russian forces led offensives against both Germany and Austria-Hungary.W. Bruce Lincoln, Passage Through Armageddon: The Russians in War and Revolution, 1914‚Äì1918 (1986) European diplomatic alignments shortly before the war. Background Between 1873 and 1887, Russia was allied with Germany and Austria-Hungary in the League of the Three Emperors and then with Germany in the 1887-1890 Reinsurance Treaty. Both collapsed because of the competing interests of Austria-Hungary and Russia in the Balkans. France took advantage of that to agree the 1894 Franco-Russian Alliance, but Britain viewed Russia with deep suspicion because of The Great Game. In 1800, over 3,000 km separated Russia and British India, but by 1902, it was 30 km in some areas with Russian advances into Central Asia. That threatened to bring the two into direct conflict, as did the long-held Russian objective of gaining control of the Bosporus Straits and with it access to the British-dominated Mediterranean Sea. Russian recruiting poster; caption reads 'World on fire; Second Patriotic War. 1900s' Defeat in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War and Britain's isolation during the 1899-1902 Second Boer War led both parties to seek allies. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 settled disputes in Asia and allowed the establishment of the Triple Entente with France, which was still largely informal. In 1908, Austria-Hungary annexed the former Ottoman province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Russia responded by creating the Balkan League to prevent further Austrian expansion. In the 1912-1913 First Balkan War, Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece captured most of the remaining Ottoman possessions in Europe. Disputes over their division resulted in the Second Balkan War in which Bulgaria was comprehensively defeated by its former allies. Russia's industrial base and railway network had significantly improved since 1905 although from a relatively-low base. In 1913, Nicholas II approved an increase in the Russian Army of over 500,000 men. Although there was no formal alliance between Russia and Serbia, their close bilateral links provided Russia with a route into the crumbling Ottoman Empire, where Germany also had significant interests. Combined with the increase in Russian military strength, both Austria and Germany felt threatened by Serbian expansion. When Austria invaded Serbia on 28 July 1914, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov viewed it as an Austro-German conspiracy to end Russian influence in the Balkans. On 30 July, Russia declared general mobilisation in support of Serbia. on 1 August, Germany declared war on Russia, followed by Austria-Hungary on the 6th. Russia and the Entente declared war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, after Ottoman warships had bombarded the Black Sea port of Odessa in late October. Unlike its Allies, the Russian Empire was one contiguous landmass, but it also considered itself the defender of its fellow Slavs in places like Serbia. Major players Historians agree on the poor quality of Russia's top leadership.D.C.B. Lieven, Russia and the Origins of the First World War (1983) pp 51-140 Tsar Nicholas II made all final decisions but was repeatedly given conflicting advice and typically made the wrong choice. He set up a deeply flawed organisational structure that was inadequate for the high pressures and the instant demands of wartime. The British historian David Stevenson, for example, points to the \\"disastrous consequences of deficient civil-military liaison\\" in which the civilians and generals were not in contact with each other. The government was entirely unaware of its fatal weaknesses and remained out of touch with public opinion. The foreign minister had to warn Nicholas that \\"unless he yielded to the popular demand and unsheathed the sword on Serbia's behalf, he would run the risk of revolution and the loss of his throne\\". Nicholas yielded but lost his throne anyway. Stevenson concludes: :Russian decision-making in July [1914] was more truly a tragedy of miscalculation... a policy of deterrence that failed to deter. Yet [like Germany] it too rested on assumptions that war was possible without domestic breakdown, and that it could be waged with a reasonable prospect of success. Russia was more vulnerable to social upheaval than any other Power. Its socialists were more estranged from the existing order than those elsewhere in Europe, and a strike wave among the industrial workforce reached a crescendo with the general stoppage in St. Petersburg in July 1914.David Stevenson, The First World War and International Politics (1988) pp. 31‚Äì32. Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov was not a powerful player. According to the historian Thomas Otte, \\"Sazonov felt too insecure to advance his positions against stronger men.... He tended to yield rather than to press home his own views.... At the critical stages of the July crisis Sazonov was inconsistent and showed an uncertain grasp of international realities. The Tsar fired Sazonov in July 1916 and gave his ministry as an extra portfolio to Prime Minister St√ºrmer. The French ambassador was aghast, depicting St√ºrmer as \\"worse than a mediocrity ‚Äì a third rate intellect, mean spirit, low character, doubtful honesty, no experience, and no idea of state business.\\"Walter G. Moss, A History of Russia: volume I: to 1917 (1997) pp. 499‚Äì504, quote on p. 503 French Ambassador Maurice Pal√©ologue was also influential by repeatedly promising France would go to war along with Russia, which was indeed the position of President Raymond Poincar√©. * Nicholas II ‚Äî Russian Emperor, until 15 March 1917) * Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich ‚Äì Commander-in-chief (1 August 1914 ‚Äì 5 September 1916) and viceroy in the Caucasus * Ivan Goremykin ‚Äì Chairmen of Council of Ministers of the Russian Empire (1 August 1914 ‚Äì 2 February 1916) * General of the Artillery Nikolay Ivanov ‚Äì Commander of the Russian army on the Southwestern Front, (1 August 1914 ‚Äì March 1916) responsible for much of the action in Galicia Serious planning for a future war was practically impossible because of the complex rivalries and priorities given to royalty. The main criteria for high command was linkage to the royalty, rather than expertise. The General Staff had expertise but was often outweighed by the elite Imperial Guards, a favourite bastion of the aristocracy that prized parades over planning large-scale military maneuvers. The grand dukes inevitably gained high commands. At one critical point in 1915, when Grand Duke Nicholas failed badly, the tsar himself took over direct command and control of the entire Army, despite his incompetence. Meanwhile, the tsar allowed the conniving monk Grigori Rasputin to exert enormous influence through his wife, including high-level appointments. The aristocrats finally assassinated him a few weeks before the tsar himself was overthrown. The infantry, artillery, cavalry and logistics services suffered poor communications with one another. The army was made up of peasants, who were ready enough to defend their own villages but showed little national pride. Recruits from Russia's numerous minorities were often persecuted in the barracks.Peter Gatrell, \\"Tsarist Russia at War: The View from Above, 1914‚ÄìFebruary 1917.\\" Journal of Modern History 87.3 (2015): 668-700 at pp 674-77. French alliance Russia depended heavily on the French alliance since a two-front war against Germany was winnable but not if Russia was alone. The French ambassador, Maurice Pal√©ologue, hated Germany and saw that when war broke out, France and Russia had to be close allies against Germany. His approach agreed with French President Raymond Poincar√©, who trusted him. Unconditional French support to Russia was promised in the unfolding crisis with Germany and Austria. Historians debate whether Pal√©gogue exceeded his instructions but agree that he failed to inform Paris of exactly what was happening, and he did not warn that Russian mobilisation might launch a world war.Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig. Decisions for war, 1914-1917 (2004) pp 121-22.Christopher Clark, The sleepwalkers: How Europe went to war in 1914 (2012) pp 435-50, 480-84.Sidney B. Fay, The Origins of the World War (1934) 2:443-46. Beginning of war On 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo, and Tsar Nicholas II vacillated as to Russia's course of action. A relatively-new factor influencing Russian policy was the growth of Pan-Slavism, which identified Russia's duty to all Slavs, especially those who practised Eastern Orthodox Christianity. The growth of that impulse shifted attention away from the Ottoman Empire and toward the threat posed to the Slavic people by the Austria-Hungary. Serbia identified itself as the champion of the Pan-Slavic ideal, and Austria-Hungary planned to destroy Serbia for that reason.Katrin Boeckh, \\"The Rebirth of Pan-Slavism in the Russian Empire, 1912‚Äì13.\\" in Katrin Boeckh and Sabine Rutar, eds. The Balkan Wars from Contemporary Perception to Historic Memory (2016) pp. 105-137. Nicholas wanted to defend Serbia but not to fight a war with Germany. In a series of letters exchanged with Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany (the so-called \\"Willy and Nicky correspondence\\"), both cousins proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired Russia's mobilization to be only against Austria-Hungary in the hopes of avoiding war with Germany. The Kaiser, however, had pledged to support Austria-Hungary. Nicky (Tsar Nicholas II) (right) with Willy (Kaiser Wilhelm) in 1905. Nicholas is wearing a German Army uniform, and Wilhelm is wearing that of a Russian hussar regiment. On 25 July 1914, Nicholas decided to intervene in the Austro-Serbian conflict, a step toward general war. He put the Russian army on \\"alert\\" on 25 July. Although it was not general mobilisation, the German and Austro-Hungarian borders were threatened and looked like military preparation for war. However, the Russian Amy had few workable plans and no contingency plans for a partial mobilisation. On 30 July 1914, Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilisation, despite being very reluctant. On 28 July, Austria-Hungary formally declared war against Serbia.Hew Strachan, The First World War, Vol I: To Arms (2001), p. 85Richard F. Hamilton, and Holger H. Herwig, eds.) Origins of World War One (2003) p. 514 Count Witte told the French Ambassador, Maurice Pal√©ologue that the Russian point of view considered the war to be madness, Slavic solidarity to be simply nonsense and nothing could be hoped by war. Battle of Tannenberg, where the Russian Second Army was annihilated by German forces On 30 July, Russia ordered general mobilisation but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks began. Germany, reacting to the discovery of Russian partial mobilisation ordered on 25 July, announced its own pre-mobilisation posture, the imminent danger of war. Germany told Russia to demobilise within twelve hours. In Saint Petersburg at 7 p.m., the German ultimatum to Russia expired. The German ambassador to Russia met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov; asked three times if Russia would reconsider; and, with shaking hands, delivered the note accepting Russia's war challenge and declaring war on 1 August. On 6 August, Franz Joseph I of Austria signed the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war against Russia. Military weakness The outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. The Allies placed their faith in the Russian army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'. Its prewar regular strength was 1,400,000, mobilisation added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square kilometre, and Russian soldiers travelled an average of to reach the front, but German soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies that the Tsar could raise, and its reserves of munitions were pitifully small. The German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other man for man, the Russian army was severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorised transports and even boots.Hew Strachan, The First World War (2001) pp. 297-316. Before the war, Russian planners had completely neglected the critical logistical issue of how the Allies could ship supplies and munitions to Russia. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and surface ships and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, Russia initially could receive help only via Archangel, which was frozen solid in winter, or via Vladivostok, which was over from the front line. By 1915, a new rail line was begun which gave access to the ice- free port of Murmansk by 1917. The Russian High Command was greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between War Minister Vladimir Sukhomlinov and the experienced warrior Grand Duke Nicholas, who commanded the armies in the field. However, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of East Prussia. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies that had invaded. The Battle of Tannenberg, where the entire Russian Second Army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over the empire's future. The loyal officers lost were the very ones that were needed to protect the dynasty. The Russian armies had some success against both the Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman Armies, but they were steadily pushed back by the German Army. In September 1914, to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia to attack German-held Silesia.Hew Strachan, The First World War (2001) pp. 316-35. The main Russian goal was focused on the Balkans and especially taking control of Constantinople. The Ottoman entry into the war opened up new opportunities, but Russia was much too hard pressed to take advantage of them. Instead, the government incited Britain and France into to the action at Gallipoli, which failed very badly. Russia then incited a rebellion by the Armenians, who were massacred in one of the great atrocities of the war, the Armenian Genocide. The combination of poor preparation and poor planning destroyed the morale of Russian troops and set the stage for the collapse of the entire regime in early 1917.Sean McMeekin, The Russian Origins of the First World War (2011) pp 115‚Äì174. Gradually, a war of attrition set in on the vast Eastern Front; the Russians were facing the combined forces of Germany and Austria-Hungary and suffered staggering losses. General Anton Denikin, retreating from Galicia wrote: :The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet.... Blood flowed unendingly, the ranks became thinner and thinner and thinner. The number of graves multiplied.Tames, p. 46 Legacy Historians on the origin of the First World War have emphasised the role of Germany and the Austria-Hungary. The consensus of scholars includes scant mention of Russia and only brief mentions of Russia's defense of Orthodox Serbia, its pan-Slavic roles, its treaty obligations with France and its concern for protecting it status as a great power. However, the historian Sean McMeekin has emphasised Russia's aggressive expansionary goal to the south. He argues that for Russia the war was ultimately about the Ottoman Empire and that the Foreign Ministry and Army were planning a war of aggression from at least 1908 and perhaps even 1895. He emphasises that the immediate goal was to seize Constantinople and an outlet to the Mediterranean by control of the Straits.McMeekin, The Russian Origins of the First World War, pp 27, 29, 101 .

He was born in Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Sonora, and during his childhood he enjoyed photography, which later became his profession. After several individual and collective exhibitions, Rodr√≠guez released a photo-book titled Baja California: De Mar a Mar (2011). In 2005, Rodr√≠guez funded Entijuanarte, an arts festival held at the Tijuana Cultural Center created to provide an exhibition space for independent artists. Following his departure from Entijuanarte, Rodr√≠guez created FotoFilm Tijuana, a photography and film festival, also at the Tijuana Cultural Center; in 2017. In 2010, Rodr√≠guez was awarded the Tijuana's Tourism Merit by the city's Tourism and Conventions Committee for his work promoting the city, his photographic career and cultural lobbying. Background and photography career Rodr√≠guez was born in Ciudad Obreg√≥n, Sonora, Mexico, on June 27, 1956. At eight years old he developed an interest in photography and during his youth he won contests sponsored by Kodak. Since 1985, he resides in Baja California and has worked as a business manager and as managing director of multiple radio stations. After deciding the state should do more to promote its natural resources, in 2000, Rodriguez started traveling and photographing its landscape. His landscape photography has been seen in individual and collective exhibitions held at multiple locations, such as Tijuana Cultural Center (2008), San Diego's International Airport and Natural History Museum (2009), University of Tijuana (CUT) (2014), Center for Technical and Higher Education (CETyS) (2015‚Äì2017), Technological University of Tijuana (CUT) (2015‚Äì2016), and the Mexican Consulates of San Diego (2016), Santa Ana and San Bernardino (2017). In 2007, a selection of his photographs of the Valle de Guadalupe and Bah√≠a de los √Ångeles appeared in National Geographic magazine. In 2008, he held two individual exhibitions; \\"La Vid\\" (\\"The Vine\\") at the Institute of the Americas and \\"Costas del Mar de Cort√©s\\" (\\"Coasts of the Sea of Cort√©s\\") at the Mingei International Museum, both in San Diego, California. In 2009, another individual exhibition, this time about Baja California, was held at the Reforma 222 complex in the Mexico City. The same year, an exhibition titled \\"Desierto, Migraci√≥n y Frontera\\" (\\"Desert, Migration and Border\\") was held at the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC). Rodr√≠guez was awarded the Tijuana's Tourism Merit by the city's Tourism and Conventions Committee in 2010 for \\"his work in the projection of Tijuana nationally and internationally, from his photographic career and his cultural lobbying\\". In 2011, he released a photo-book titled Baja California: De Mar a Mar. About the book, Rodr√≠guez said: \\"few populations in the world count on the geographic privilege of Baja California, a land that joins sea, desert, valleys, mountains, art rock and vestiges of missions that as a whole it is a worthy natural treasure, not only to worship, but also worth enough to document\\". A selection of the images included in the book was exhibited at the Tijuana's City Hall in 2012. Arts festivals =Entijuanarte= In addition to his work as a photographer, Rodr√≠guez funded an arts festival called Entijuanarte in 2005, an arts festival that includes a program of cultural and artistic intervention of the northwest of Mexico. After a visit to the ArtWalk in Little Italy, San Diego, Rodr√≠guez thought the format could be replicated in Tijuana, since the city was suffering from a spree of violence; he said, \\"[art] allows to re-signify the city, and recover the public space\\" to Emeequis magazine. The event was intended for independent artists to exhibit their work. In 2017, it was announced that Rodr√≠guez would leave Entijuanarte to pursue new projects. =FotoFilm Tijuana= Following his tenure in Entijuanarte, Rodr√≠guez created a photography and film festival called FotoFilm Tijuana, after noticing the rise of audiovisual recordings with smartphones and tablet computers. As part of daily life, recording videos and taking photographs, \\"is within everyone's reach\\", Rodr√≠guez said to Mexican newspaper Milenio. He also noted that users are creating simple and free content and this creative facility creates the bases of interest in the public for this kind of events. The first edition of FotoFilm Tijuana was held from July 14‚Äì17, 2017, and according to Rodr√≠guez had 30 different activities, 41 speakers, 180 featured artists, and 22,000 attendees. The second edition of the festival (July 27‚Äì31, 2018) expanded to five days and included 60 different activities.
