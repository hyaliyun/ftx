It is lighter in color than nimbostratus and darker than high cirrostratus. The sun can be seen through thin altostratus, but thicker layers can be quite opaque. Altostratus undulatus Altostratus is formed by the lifting of a large mostly stable air mass that causes invisible water vapor to condense into cloud. It can produce light precipitation, often in the form of virga. If the precipitation increases in persistence and intensity, the altostratus cloud may thicken into nimbostratus. Altostratus most often takes the form of a featureless sheet of cloud but can be wavy (undulatus) as a result of wind shear through the cloud. It can also be fragmented (fibratus) with clear sky visible, which often precedes the approach of a weakened or upper level warm front.  Description  Altostratus can be composed of ice crystals. In some ice crystal altostratus, very thin, rapidly disappearing horizontal sheets of water droplets appear at random. The sizes of the ice crystals in the cloud tended to increase as altitude decreased. However, close to the bottom of the cloud, the particles decreased in size again. During the sampling of one cloud, the scientists noted a halo while flying near the top of the cloud, which indicated that the ice crystals were hexagonal near the top. However, farther down, the ice crystals became more conglomerated.  Occurrence  Altostratus tends to form ahead of a warm or occluded front, the altostratus gradually thickening into rain bearing nimbostratus. However it can also occur together with cumulus congestus or cumulonimbus at a cold front. Subtypes :*Species: Altostratus is not divided into species because it is always nebulous or featureless in structure. ::*Opacity-based varieties: Altocumulus translucidus is relatively thin so that the sun or moon is always visible as if seen through frosted glass. It is strictly a middle cloud and is coded CM1 in the SYNOP report. The opacus variety is sufficiently thick to obscure the sun or moon and can extend vertically into the high √©tage. It is therefore sometimes classified as vertical or multi-level, but is still coded CM2 as a middle cloud. ::*Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus, duplicatus, and undulatus are all occasionally associated with altostratus. :::*Precipitation- based supplementary features: Altostratus opacus can be thick enough to produce both virga or precipitation features. :::*Cloud-based supplementary feature: Mamma may be occasionally seen with altostratus, especially if it is associated with or changing to or from altocumulus. :::*Accessory cloud: Pannus forming in precipitation is sometimes seen with altostratus and is coded CL7\\\\. :::*Genitus mother clouds: Altostratus altocumulogenitus forms due to the fusing of altocumulus elements. Altostratus cumulonimbogenitus results from the spreading of the middle part of a cumulonimbus cloud. :::*Mutatus mother clouds: Cirrostratus can thicken into altostratus cirrostratomutatus, usually ahead of an approaching disturbance. Nimbostratus associated with an organized weather system may lift and change into altostratus nimbostratomutatus, especially if the disturbance is weakening or moving out of a particular area. \\"Velum\\" is considered a type of Cumulonimbus cloud so it is not listed.

Weak convective currents create shallow cloud layers because of drier, stable air above preventing continued vertical development. Historically, in English, this type of cloud has been referred to as a twain cloud for being a combination of two types of clouds. Description=Occurrence= Vast areas of subtropical and polar oceans are covered with massive sheets of stratocumulus. These may organize into distinctive patterns which are currently under active study. In subtropics, they cover the edges of the horse latitude climatological highs, and reduce the amount of solar energy absorbed in the ocean. When these drift over land the summer heat or winter cold is reduced. 'Dull weather' is a common expression incorporated with overcast stratocumulus days, which usually occur either in a warm sector between a warm and cold front in a depression, or in an area of high pressure, in the latter case, sometimes persisting over a specific area for several days. If the air over land is moist and hot enough, stratocumulus may develop to various cumulus clouds, or, more commonly, the sheet of stratocumulus may become thick enough to produce some light rain. On drier areas they quickly dissipate over land, resembling cumulus humilis. This often occurs in late morning in areas under anticyclonic weather, the stratocumulus breaking up under the sun's heat and often reforming again by evening as the heat of the sun decreases again. =Precipitation= Most often, stratocumulus produce no precipitation, and when they do, it is generally only light rain or snow. However, these clouds are often seen at either the front or tail end of worse weather, so they may indicate storms to come, in the form of thunderheads or gusty winds. They are also often seen underneath the cirrostratus and altostratus sheets that often precede a warm front, as these higher clouds decrease the sun's heat and therefore convection, causing any cumulus clouds to spread out into stratocumulus clouds. =Comparison altocumulus= Stratocumulus clouds are same in appearance to altocumulus and are often mistaken for such. A simple test to distinguish these is to compare the size of individual masses or rolls: when pointing one's hand in the direction of the cloud, if the cloud is about the size of the thumb, it is altocumulus; if it is the size of one's fist, it is stratocumulus. This often does not apply when stratocumulus is of a broken, fractus form, when it may appear as small as altocumulus. Stratocumulus is also often, though not always, darker in colour than altocumulus. =Optical effects= Stratocumulus clouds are the main type of cloud that can produce crepuscular rays. Thin stratocumulus clouds are also often the cause of corona effects around the Moon at night. All stratocumulus subtypes are coded CL5 except when formed from free convective mother clouds (CL4) or when formed separately from co-existing (CL8).  Species  Stratocumulus stratiformis opacus in Pennsylvania Stratocumulus lenticularis clouds in Jackson, Wyoming Stratocumulus Stratiformis are extensive flat but slightly lumpy sheets that show only minimal convective activity. Stratocumulus Lenticularis are separate flat elongated seed-shaped clouds. They are typical for polar countries or warmer climate during winter seasons. They also can be formed by winds passing hills or mountains, such as Foehn winds, and in this case they can be very regularly shaped. Stratocumulus Castellanus have stronger convective activity due to the presence of increasingly unstable air. They are distinct from other stratocumulus by puffy tower-like formations atop the cloud layer. They look like cumulus congestus, but can be easily confused: \\"towers\\" of cumulus congestus grow above separate clouds, whereas in the case of stratocumulus castellanus, there is always a more or less defined layer of clouds. Stratocumulus castellanus may develop into cumulus congestus (and even further into cumulonimbus) under auspicious conditions. Any showers from stratocumulus castellanus are not usually as heavy as those from cumulus congestus.  Opacity-based varieties  Stratocumulus Opacus is a dark layer of clouds covering entire sky without any break. However, the cloud sheet is not completely uniform, so that separate cloud bases still can be seen. This is the main precipitating type, however any rain is usually light. If the cloud layer becomes grayer to the point when individual clouds cannot be distinguished, stratocumulus turn into stratus clouds. Stratocumulus Perlucidus is a layer of stratocumulus clouds with small spaces, appearing in irregular pattern, through which clear sky or higher clouds can be seen. Stratocumulus Translucidus consist of separate groups of stratocumulus clouds, with a clear sky (or higher clouds) visible between them. No precipitation in most cases.  Pattern-based varieties  Stratocumulus undulatus, seen from a plane. Stratocumulus Undulatus clouds appear as nearly parallel waves, rolls or separate elongated clouds, without significant vertical development. Stratocumulus Radiatus clouds appear as the same as stratocumulus undulatus, but stratocumulus undulatus move perpendicular to the wind shear, while stratocumulus radiatus move parallel to the wind shear. Stratocumulus Duplicatus clouds appear as stratocumulus clouds with two or more layers or sheets. Stratocumulus duplicatus is common on species lenticularis or lenticular cloud. Stratocumulus Lacunosus clouds are very uncommon. They only occur when there are localized downdrafts striking through the stratocumuliform cloud.  Supplementary feature  Stratocumulus Mamma is a type of mammatus cloud.  Precipitation-based supplementary features  Stratocumulus Virga is a form of precipitation that evaporates in mid-air and doesn't reach the ground. Stratocumulus Praecipitatio is a form of precipitation that reaches the ground as light rain or snow.  Mother clouds  Stratocumulus Cumulomutatus the specific type of stratocumulus clouds, are flat and elongated. They form in the evening, when updrafts caused by convection decrease making cumulus clouds lose vertical development and spread horizontally. They also can occur under altostratus cloud preceding a warm or occluded front, when cumulus usually lose vertical development as the sun's heat decreases. Like all other forms of stratocumulus apart from castellanus, they are also often found in anticyclones. Stratocumulus Cumulogenitus out of cumulus or cumulonimbus clouds, disrupted by decreasing convection. During formation period, puffy tops of cumulus clouds can protrude from stratocumulus cumulogenitus for a relatively long time until they completely spread in horizontal direction. Stratocumulus cumulogenitus appear as lengthy sheet or as group of separate elongated cloud rolls or waves.  Future  A recent simulation has suggested that within a century, stratocumulus clouds may disappear, contributing to climate change.

Nimbostratus usually produces precipitation over a wide area. Nimbo- is from the Latin word nimbus, which denotes precipitation. Downward-growing nimbostratus can have the same vertical extent as most large upward-growing cumulus, but its horizontal extent tends to be even greater. Appearance Nimbostratus has a diffuse cloud base generally found anywhere from near surface in the low levels to about in the middle level of the troposphere. Although usually dark at its base, it often appears illuminated from within to a surface observer. Nimbostratus usually has a thickness of about 2000 to 4000 m. Though found worldwide, nimbostratus occurs more commonly in the middle latitudes. It is coded CM2 on the SYNOP report. Formation Nimbostratus occurs along a warm front or occluded front where the slowly rising warm air mass creates nimbostratus along with shallower stratus clouds producing less rain, these clouds being preceded by higher- level clouds such as cirrostratus and altostratus. Often, when an altostratus cloud thickens and descends into lower altitudes, it will become nimbostratus. Nimbostratus, unlike cumulonimbus, is not associated with thunderstorms, however at an unusually unstable warm front caused as a result of the advancing warm air being hot, humid and unstable, cumulonimbus clouds may be embedded within the usual nimbostratus. Lightning from an embedded cumulonimbus cloud may interact with the nimbostratus but only in the immediate area around it. In this situation with lightning and rain occurring it would be hard to tell which type of cloud was producing the rain from the ground, however cumulonimbus tend to produce larger droplets and more intense downpours. The occurrence of cumulonimbus and nimbostratus together is uncommon, and usually only nimbostratus is found at a warm front. Forecast Nimbostrati often have very few visual features. Nimbostratus is generally a sign of an approaching warm or occluded front producing steady moderate precipitation, as opposed to the shorter period of typically heavier precipitation released by a cold-frontal cumulonimbus cloud. Precipitation may last for several days, depending on the speed of the frontal system. A nimbostratus virga cloud is the same as normal nimbostratus, but the rain or snow falls as virga which doesn't reach the ground. Stratus or stratocumulus usually replace the nimbostratus after the passage of the warm or occluded front. Origin of name Under Luke Howard's first systematized study of clouds, carried out in France in 1802, three general cloud forms were established based on appearance and characteristics of formation: cirriform, cumuliform and stratiform. These were further divided into upper and lower types depending on altitude. In addition to these three main types, Howard added two names to designate multiple cloud types joined together: cumulostratus, a blending of cumulus clouds and stratus layers, and nimbus, a complex blending of cirriform, cumuliform, and stratiform clouds with sufficient vertical development to produce significant precipitation. Later, in the 20th century, an IMC commission for the study of clouds put forward a refined and more restricted definition of the genus nimbus, effectively reclassifying it as a stratiform cloud type. It was then renamed nimbostratus, and published with the new name in the 1932 edition of the International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky. This left cumulonimbus as the only nimboform type as indicated by its root name. Subtypes and derivative types :*Species and varieties: Nimbostratus is very thick, opaque, and featureless, so this genus type is not subdivided into species or varieties. :::*Precipitation-based supplementary features: Nimbostratus is a major precipitation cloud and produces the virga or praecipitatio features. The latter can achieve heavy intensity due to the cloud's vertical depth. :::*Accessory cloud: Nimbostratus pannus is an accessory cloud of nimbostratus that forms as a ragged layer in precipitation below the main cloud deck. Pannus is coded CL7\\\\. :::*Genitus mother clouds: This genus type can form from cumulus and cumulonimbus. :::*Mutatus mother clouds: Nimbostratus can form due to the complete transformation of altocumulus, altostratus and stratocumulus.  Relation to other clouds  Multi-level nimbostratus is physically related to other stratiform genus-types by way of being non-convective in nature. However, the other sheet-like clouds usually each occupy only one or two levels at the same time. Stratus clouds are low-level and form from near ground level to at all latitudes. In the middle level are the altostratus clouds that form from to in polar areas, in temperate areas, and in tropical areas. Although altostratus forms mostly in the middle level of the troposphere, strong frontal lift can push it into the lower part of the high- level. The main high-level stratiform cloud is cirrostratus which is composed of ice crystals that often produce halo effects around the sun. Cirrostratus forms at altitudes of in high latitudes, in temperate latitudes, and in low, tropical latitudes. Of the non-stratiform clouds, cumulonimbus and cumulus congestus are the most closely related to nimbostratus because of their vertical extent and ability to produce moderate to heavy precipitation. The remaining cumuliform (cumulus) and stratocumuliform (stratocumulus, altocumulus, and cirrocumulus) clouds have the least in common with nimbus.

They usually occur at an altitude of . Like lower-altitude cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, cirrocumulus signifies convection. Unlike other high-altitude tropospheric clouds like cirrus and cirrostratus, cirrocumulus includes a small amount of liquid water droplets, although these are in a supercooled state. Ice crystals are the predominant component, and typically, the ice crystals cause the supercooled water drops in the cloud to rapidly freeze, transforming the cirrocumulus into cirrostratus. This process can also produce precipitation in the form of a virga consisting of ice or snow. Thus, cirrocumulus clouds are usually short-lived., p.21 They usually only form as part of a short-lived transitional phase within an area of cirrus clouds and can also form briefly as a result of the breaking up of part of a cumulonimbus anvil. Properly, the term cirrocumulus refers to each cloud, but is typically also used to refer to an entire patch of cirrocumulus. When used in this way, each cirrocumulus element is referred to as a \\"cloudlet\\". Appearance High cloud weather map symbols Cirrocumulus is a cloud of the stratocumuliform physical category that shows both stratiform and cumuliform characteristics and typically appears as white, patchy sheets with ripples or tufts without gray shading. Each cloudlet appears no larger than a finger held at arm's length. These often are organized in rows like other cumuliform and stratocumuliform clouds, but since they are so small, cirrocumulus patches take on a finer appearance, sometimes also referred to colloquially as \\"herringbone\\" or as a \\"mackerel sky\\". Cirrocumulus is coded CH9 for the main genus-type and all subforms. Cirrocumulus is distinguished from altocumulus in several ways, although the two stratocumuliform genus types can occasionally occur together with no clear demarcation between them. Cirrocumulus generally occur at higher altitudes than altocumulus, thus the \\"cloudlets\\" appear smaller, as they are more distant from observation at ground level. They are also colder. Cirrocumulus clouds never cast self-shadows and are translucent to a certain degree. They are also typically found amongst other cirrus clouds in the sky and are usually themselves seen to be transforming into these other types of cirrus. This often occurs at the leading edge of a warm front, where many types of cirriform clouds can be present. Cirrocumulus clouds on a summer afternoon Cirrocumulus clouds tend to reflect the red and yellow colours during a sunset and sunrise, so they have been referred to as \\"one of the most beautiful clouds\\". This occurs because they reflect the unscattered rays of light from the early morning or evening sun, and those rays are yellow, orange, red, and sometimes purple. Forecasting Cirrocumulus usually only forms in patches. If it forms in patches with cirrus or cirrostratus and the clouds spread across the sky, it usually means rain in 8‚Äì10 hours (can be more if the front is slow-moving). Only small patches of cirrocumulus and perhaps some wisps of cirrus usually mean a continuation of good weather (although this may also be seen in conjunction with showers and thunderstorms). If it is seen after rain, it usually means improving the weather. Subtypes :*Species: Cirrocumulus stratiformis (Cc str) is one of four species and appears in the form of relatively flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species Cirrocumulus lenticularis (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. Cirrocumulus castellanus (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name Cirrocumulus floccus (Cc flo). Cirrocumulus with castellanus buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-√©tage clouds. ::*Varieties: This genus type is always translucent and so has no opacity- based varieties. However, like cirrus, certain cirrocumulus species can sometimes be divided into pattern-based varieties. The undulatus variety has a wavy undulating base and is seen mostly with the stratiformis and lenticularis species types. The lacunosus variety contains circular holes caused by downdrafts in the cloud and is associated mainly with the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus. :::*Precipitation-based supplementary feature: Cirrocumulus occasionally produces virga, precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.. :::*Cloud-based supplementary feature: Mamma in the form of downward forming bubbles is infrequently seen as a cloud- based supplementary feature. :::*Mother clouds: This genus type has no recognized genitus mother clouds. However cirrocumulus stratiformis cirromutatus or cirrostratomutatus can result from sheets or filaments of high cloud taking on a stratocumuliform structure as a result of high altitude convection. A high layer of white or light grey altocumulus of a particular species can thin out into pure white cirrocumulus altocumulomutatus of the same species.

The cloud has a fibrous texture with no halos if it is thicker cirrostratus fibratus. On the approach of a frontal system, the cirrostratus often begins as nebulous and turns to fibratus. If the cirrostratus begins as fragmented of clouds in the sky it often means the front is weak. Cirrostratus is usually located above 5.5 km (18,000 ft). Its presence indicates a large amount of moisture in the upper troposphere.Ludlum, D. (1991). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. .

Polar stratospheric clouds can take on this appearance when composed of tiny supercooled droplets of water or nitric acid. Cirrostratus at night causing a moon halo Cirrostratus clouds sometimes signal the approach of a warm front if they form after cirrus and spread from one area across the sky, and thus may be signs that precipitation might follow in the next 12 to 24 hours or as soon as 6‚Äì8 hours if the front is fast moving. If the cirrostratus is broken fibratus, it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud (meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow). Cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below cirrostratus formations, due to the stable air associated with cirrostratus creating an inversion and restricting convection, causing cumuliform clouds to become flattened. Contrails also tend to spread out and can be visible for up to an hour in cirrostratus. The phrase \\"milky sunshine\\" is often, as well as referring to haze or light mist, used to refer to the milky look of the sky when cirrostratus is present.

It is reported in the SYNOP code as CH8 or as CH5 or 6 (depending on the amount of sky covered) if increasing in amount. If the high cloud covers the entire sky and takes on the form of a featureless veil, it is classified as cirrostratus of the species nebulosus (Cs neb) and is coded CH7\\\\. ::* Varieties: Cirrostratus species have no opacity-based varieties as they are always translucent. Two pattern-based varieties are sometimes seen with the species fibratus. These are the closely spaced duplicatus and wavy undulatus types similar to those seen with cirrus fibratus. Pattern-based varieties are not commonly associated with the species nebulosus due to its lack of features. :::* Supplementary features: Cirrostratus produces no precipitation or virga, and is not accompanied by any accessory clouds. :::* Genitus mother clouds: Cirrostratus fibratus cirrocumulogenitus sometimes appears as the latter cloud flattens and loses some of its stratocumuliform structure. Cirrostratus fibratus cumulonimbogenitus may form if the cirriform top of a mature thundercloud spreads and flattens sufficiently to become a high stratiform cloud. :::* Mutatus mother clouds: Cirrostratus fibratus cirromutatus or cirrocumulomutatus are the result of a complete transformation from cirrus and cirrocumulus genus types.

More specifically, the term stratus is used to describe flat, hazy, featureless clouds at low altitudes varying in color from dark gray to nearly white. The word stratus comes from the Latin prefix strato-, meaning \\"layer\\". Stratus clouds may produce a light drizzle or a small amount of snow. These clouds are essentially above-ground fog formed either through the lifting of morning fog or through cold air moving at low altitudes over a region. Some call these clouds \\"high fog\\" for their fog-like form. While light rain may fall, this cloud does not indicate much meteorological precipitation.  Formation  Stratus clouds form when a sheet of warm, moist air lifts off the ground and depressurizes, following the lapse rate. This causes the relative humidity to increase due to the adiabatic cooling.  Description  Stratus clouds look like featureless gray to white sheets of cloud. They can be composed of water droplets, supercooled water droplets, or ice crystals depending upon the ambient temperature.

Stratus fractus clouds on the other hand, appear with an irregular shape, and forms with a clearly fragmented or ragged appearance. They mostly appear under the precipitation of major rain-bearing clouds; these are the nimbostratus clouds, and the cumulonimbus clouds, and are classified as pannus clouds. Stratus fractus can also form beside mountain slopes, without the presence of nimbus clouds (clouds that precipitate), and their color can be from dark grey to almost white. = Opacity-based varieties = Stratus fractus are not divided into varieties, but stratus nebulosus on the other hand, are divided into two. The Stratus opacus variety appears as a nebulous or milky sheet of the nebulosus species, but are opaque enough to block the sun from view. Stratus Translucidus is another variety of the nebulosus species. These clouds are considered more thin than the opacus variety because this cloud is rather translucent, allowing the position of the sun or moon to be observed from earth's surface. = Pattern-based variety = Stratus clouds only have one pattern-based variety. This is the stratus undulatus variety. Mild undulations can be observed from this cloud, only associated by the nebulosus species. Though rare, this cloud formation is caused by disturbances on the gentle wind shear. Stratus undulatus clouds are more common on stratus stratocumulomutatus clouds where the wind is stronger as height increases. = Genitus mother clouds = Stratus cumulogenitus clouds occur when the base of cumulus clouds spreads, creating a nebulous sheet of stratiform clouds. This can also occur on nimbostratus clouds (stratus nimbostratogenitus) and on cumulonimbus clouds (stratus cumulonimbogenitus). Stratus fractus clouds can also form under the base of precipitation-bearing clouds and are classified as pannus clouds. = Mutatus mother cloud = Stratus only has one mutatus mother cloud. Stratus stratocumulomutatus clouds occur when stratocumulus opacus patches fuse to create a stratiform layer. = Accessory clouds and supplementary feature = Stratus clouds don't produce accessory clouds, but a supplementary feature praecipitatio is derived from Latin, which means \\"precipitation\\". Stratus clouds are too low to produce virga, or rain shears that evaporate before reaching the ground.  Forecast  A stratus cloud can form from stratocumulus spreading out under an inversion, indicating a continuation of prolonged cloudy weather with drizzle for several hours and then an improvement as it breaks into stratocumulus. Stratus clouds can persist for days in anticyclone conditions. It is common for a stratus to form on a weak warm front, rather than the usual nimbostratus. = Effects on climate = According to Sednev, Menon, and McFarquhar, Arctic stratus and other low-level clouds form roughly 50% of the annual cloud cover in Arctic regions, causing a large effect on the energy emissions and absorptions through radiation.  Relation to other clouds = Cirrostratus clouds = A cirrostratus cloud Cirrostratus clouds, a very high ice-crystal form of stratiform clouds, can appear as a milky sheen in the sky or as a striated sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, fibratus and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards the top of the cloud, at temperatures of around to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later. = Altostratus clouds  Nimbostratus clouds  Stratocumulus clouds = A stratocumulus cloud is another type of a cumuliform or stratiform cloud. Like stratus clouds, they form at low levels; but like cumulus clouds, they form via convection. Unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion, causing them to flatten out like stratus clouds and giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect a large amount of the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing.

They have undergone numerous changes in personnel and have explored many musical styles throughout their history, including jazz, soul, funk, rock, and pop music. After settling on their name following several changes, the group signed to De-Lite Records and released their debut album, Kool and the Gang (1970). The band's first taste of success came with the release of their fourth album Wild and Peaceful (1973), which contained the US top-ten singles \\"Jungle Boogie\\" and \\"Hollywood Swinging\\". Kool & the Gang subsequently entered a period of decline before they reached a second commercial peak between 1979 and 1986 following their partnership with Brazilian musician/producer Eumir Deodato and the addition of singer James \\"J.T.\\" Taylor to the line-up. Their most successful albums of this period include Ladies' Night (1979), Celebrate! (1980), and Emergency (1984), their highest selling album with two million copies sold in the US. Their hit singles during this period included \\"Ladies' Night\\", the US number one \\"Celebration\\", \\"Get Down on It\\", \\"Joanna\\", \\"Misled\\", and \\"Cherish\\". The band continues to perform worldwide, including as support for Van Halen in 2012 and their fiftieth-anniversary tour in 2014. Kool & the Gang have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, seven American Music Awards, and, in 2006, a Music Business Association Chairman's Award for artistic achievement. As well the band has been inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame and been bestowed with a Mobo Award for Outstanding Achievement, the Soul Train Legend Award, the Marian Anderson Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During 2018, the Bells, Brown, and Taylor were also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Their discography includes 23 studio albums and almost 70 singles. They have sold 7.5 million and 4.5 million RIAA-certified albums and singles, respectively, in the US. Worldwide, they have sold 70 million albums.  History = 1964‚Äì1969: Formation = The band formed in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1964 when seven school friends decided to perform together as an instrumental jazz and soul group named the Jazziacs. Among them were Robert \\"Kool\\" Bell on bass, his brother Ronald Bell on keyboards, Robert \\"Spike\\" Mickens on trumpet, Dennis \\"D.T.\\" Thomas on saxophone, Ricky West on keyboards, George Brown on drums, and Charles Smith guitar. All of them, except Smith, attended Lincoln High School in Jersey City. Robert Bell had given himself the nickname \\"Kool\\" as a way of adapting to the street gangs in his neighborhood after moving from Ohio and took the name of someone named Cool, replacing his with a \\"K\\". The Bells' father Bobby and uncle Tommy were boxers. They moved to New York to train and lived in the same apartment building as Thelonious Monk, who became Robert's godfather. Miles Davis would drop by because he wanted to be a boxer. Their first gigs took place as the opening act to a weekly jazz night held in a local theatre every Sunday. They also played occasionally with McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, and Leon Thomas during their early period. The group then underwent several name changes, including The Soul Town Band and The New Dimensions, during which they would play Motown covers as the backing musicians for Soul Town, a small Jersey City-based organization similar to Motown. In 1967, they decided to perform as their own identity and became regulars at the Blue Note Lounge in Jersey; one of the MC's advertised them with a new name, Kool & the Flames. However, their manager Gene Redd advised against it to avoid confusion with James Brown's band, The Famous Flames, leading to a further change to Kool & the Gang, in 1969. = 1969‚Äì1972: Signing with De-Lite and early albums = After securing their new name and line-up, Kool & the Gang secured a recording deal with Redd's new independent label, De-Lite Records. Redd wrote: \\"I discovered these eight supertalented incomparable young musicians [...] I immediately realized that their potential would earn them success unknown by most musicians\\". The group entered the studio and recorded their debut album, the all-instrumental Kool and the Gang (1970), with Redd as a producer, arranger, conductor, and partial songwriter. It is their only album with guitarist Woody Sparrow who completed a temporary eight-man formation. The album peaked at No. 46 on the Billboard R&B; chart. Around this time, the group began to develop their stage performance after they witnessed a set by Willie Feaster and the Mighty Magnificents which, according to Robert Bell, \\"Blew us away [...] We thought, 'Wow, if we want to be in show business, we have to change our act. We can't just stand up there and play'.\\" The band followed their debut with two live albums: Live at the Sex Machine, recorded the year before, and Live at PJ's, both released in 1971. They returned to the studio in 1972 to record Music Is the Message, released in July 1972, which went to No. 25 on the R&B; chart. It was quickly followed by Good Times in November, which features the band backed by a string section. The elements of jazz, rock, and instrumental styles on the record made it difficult for reviewers to label them as one specific genre. = 1973‚Äì1978: Rise to fame and low period = Kool & the Gang had their first commercial success with their fourth studio album Wild and Peaceful, which gave the band three more hits: \\"Funky Stuff\\" in the Top 40 pop chart and \\"Jungle Boogie\\" and \\"Hollywood Swinging\\" in the Top 10. The latter two songs sold over one million copies and were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Their success continued with Light of Worlds (1974) In October 1974, the group landed a spot on the national television music show Soul Train. In 1975, Kool & the Gang released Spirit of the Boogie. In 1976, Kool & the Gang entered a period of commercial decline following the rise of disco music in the charts. Rolling Stone writer Geoff Himes wrote the disco-era \\"frowned on [their] loose and greasy approach to dance music.\\" This was demonstrated by the band's three albums released during this time, Open Sesame (1976), The Force (1977), and Everybody's Dancin' (1978). Robert Bell said De-Lite Records had built the group's own recording studio in Philadelphia. Bell later spoke of these albums: \\"It bent our style a bit and we didn't feel at home with it\\". The Force and Everybody's Dancin displayed the group's attempt to adopt disco elements with featured female vocalists and a string section, but Robert Bell later said: \\"We got too fancy and over-creative [...] We got away from the basic Kool & the Gang sound [...] and the public didn't like it\\". The change in style affected their ability to secure as many dates than before, working \\"just off and on\\" during this time. The latter album received negative responses; one review for Everybody's Dancin had the headline: \\"Kool and the Gang have gone bland.\\" Writer Mike Duffy wrote: \\"They've joined the disco lemmings [...] The edge has gone. Say so long to the raw and raunchy.\\" During their low period, the band gained some mainstream attention with their contribution of \\"Open Sesame\\" to the soundtrack of Saturday Night Fever (1977). \\"Summer Madness\\" was also used in Rocky (1976), but not released on its soundtrack album. = 1979‚Äì1987: J.T. Taylor and commercial peak = Eumir Deodato, pictured in 1970 To help their situation, Kool & the Gang changed musical direction in two distinct ways. After several years of consideration, they decided to bring in a dedicated lead vocalist to become more of a focal point to their music, at the suggestion of promoter turned SOLAR Records founder Dick Griffey. By 1979, South Carolina-born singer James \\"J.T.\\" Taylor had joined the group, who noted that vocals added more warmth to the songs, especially to ballads, which the group had avoided as no one could sing them properly. Taylor also recalled some resistance from some members and the group of female singers they had used on The Force and Everybody's Dancin. The change in style developed further when the band entered a four-album association with Brazilian musician Eumir Deodato as their producer, who helped them move towards mainstream pop and dance-oriented music, with greater emphasis on catchy hooks and chorus lines. The first choice for a new, outside producer was Stevie Wonder, but he was too busy. In 1979, the band recorded and released Ladies' Night, which became their most successful album since their formation helped by the singles \\"Too Hot\\" and \\"Ladies' Night\\", which went to No. 5 and No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, respectively. In January 1980, Ladies' Night was certified platinum by the RIAA for selling one million copies in the US. In September 1980, the band released its second collaborative album with Deodato, Celebrate!. It became a bigger commercial success than Ladies' Night; the lead single \\"Celebration\\" remains the band's only single to reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The song originated from the lyric \\"Come on, let's all celebrate\\" from \\"Ladies' Night\\" which inspired Robert Bell to write a song that he described as \\"an international anthem.\\" The band developed the song on a tour bus after attending the American Music Awards. The song was used in national media coverage for the 1980 World Series, the 1981 Super Bowl, the 1981 NBA Finals, and the 1981 return of the Iran hostages. After the release of Something Special (1981), which continued the level of success of the previous two albums, the band recorded their fourth and final album with Deodato, As One (1982). The latter struggled to reach gold certification in the US, which led to the band's decision to end their time with Deodato as they had enough with the direction they had adopted. They then decided to produce their next album, In the Heart (1983), by themselves with Jim Bonnefond as co-producer. The album contained the US top-five single \\"Joanna\\". The song was declared the most-played pop song in 1984 by Broadcast Music International. Bonnefond stayed with the group for Emergency (1984), which remains their highest selling album with over two million copies sold in the US. It spawned four US top 20 singles, including \\"Emergency\\", \\"Cherish\\", \\"Fresh\\", and \\"Misled\\". This feat made Kool & the Gang the only band to have four top 20 singles from a single album in 1985. In June 1984, Kool & the Gang took time off from recording Emergency to perform at Wembley Stadium as part of a sold-out summer concert organised by Elton John. That November, during a visit to Phonogram's offices in London, Bob Geldof arrived to pitch his idea of the multi-artist charity single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" to the label. Kool & the Gang participated in the project. In 1985, Bell said the band retained control of their own business affairs, avoiding to hire management on a full-time basis and preferring to hire consultants and agents for each project or a single term. The group's seventeenth album, Forever, was released in November 1986. The album included two hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart: \\"Victory\\" (US #10, R&B; #2) and \\"Stone Love\\" (US #10, R&B; #4). Two further singles, \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Special Way\\" were also released from the album; the former reached the top ten on the R&B; Chart, the latter hit reached #6 on the Adult Contemporary chart. By 1986, the band had scored 14 top 40 singles in the US since 1980, more than Michael Jackson. In July 1986, the band recorded a special version of \\"Celebration\\" with different vocals that was used in an advertisement for Wendy's.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/business/advertising-wendy-s-spot- created-by-lockhardt-pettus.html In 1987, the band completed a 50-city tour of the US. The tour included the group establishing their own public service program, devised by Robert Bell and Taylor, which encouraged school children to pursue education, giving free tickets to those with perfect attendance. The group rehearsed their stage show with a choreographer at Prince's studio at Paisley Park. At the time of the tour's start, the band ceased producing adverts with Schlitz beer because of their new image towards children and that they felt it had run its course. After the tour, Taylor left Kool & the Gang to pursue a solo career. He returned in 1996 for their State of Affairs album. = 1988‚Äìpresent: Later career = In February 1988, news of Taylor's departure from the band to pursue a solo career were reported in the press. The group had discussed pursuing solo projects during the previous year, with Thomas suggesting the band had considered splitting into twos or threes. Taylor was replaced by three vocalists: Sennie \\"Skip\\" Martin, Odeen Mays, and Gary Brown. 1989 saw the release of the band's 18th album Sweat. By this time Khalis Bayyan and Robert \\"Spike\\" Mickens also had departed the band. The album didn't fare well. Ron Wynn of Allmusic called the album \\"a completely faceless, aimless record‚Ä¶probably the worst album of their career,\\". Unite, the band's nineteenth studio album, was released in 1992. It marked the return of Khalis Bayyan to the group. In 1995, Taylor returned to the band for State of Affairs (1996), hailed as the group's \\"comeback\\" album. All songs on this album were written by Khalis Bayyan and Taylor. Taylor left the band for the second time in 1999. On their next studio album Gangland (2001), Kool & the Gang pursued elements of hip hop. The album was a compilation of rappers backed by Kool and the Gang remaking some of the band's songs. During 2003 the band was bestowed with a Mobo Award for Outstanding Achievement. 2004 saw the release of yet another album with remakes from old songs. The Hits Reloaded contained collaborations with artists such as Atomic Kitten, Lisa Stansfield and Jamiroquai. The album reached No. 21 on the UK R&B; Albums chart. During 2007 the band released another album entitled Still Kool. Still Kool has been certified Platinum in France by the SNEP. In 2012, Bell accepted Van Halen singer David Lee Roth's invitation for Kool & the Gang to be the opening act during their A Different Kind of Truth Tour as Roth had noticed a significant portion of their concert audience were women. Roth wanted the group after seeing their set at Glastonbury. In 2013 the group released a Christmas album Kool for the Holidays. This is the group's 24th and most recent studio album to date. In 2015, 50 years after formation, the group received their star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. During that year they were also inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Within 2016 a Jersey City street was renamed the \\"Kool and the Gang Way\\". During 2019 Kool and the Gang was also bestowed with the Marian Anderson Award.

In the system of Greek numerals it has the value 9. Greek The alphabet on a black figure vessel, with a point-and-circle theta. In Ancient Greek, Œ∏ represented the aspirated voiceless dental plosive , but in Modern Greek it represents the voiceless dental fricative . =Forms= In its archaic form, Œ∏ was written as a cross within a circle (as in the Etruscan A symbol of a cross within a circle or Another symbol of a cross within a circle), and later, as a line or point in circle (The symbol of a line within a circle or The symbol of a point within a circle). Archaic crossed forms of theta are seen in the wheel letters of Linear A and Linear B.

In March, 2020 Unicode added four characters to represent tau gallicum:  * Cyrillic The early Cyrillic letter fita (—≤, —≥) developed from Œ∏.

According to Porphyry of Tyros, the Egyptians used an X within a circle as a symbol of the soul; having a value of nine, it was used as a symbol for Ennead. Johannes Lydus says that the Egyptians used a symbol for Kosmos in the form of theta, with a fiery circle representing the world, and a snake spanning the middle representing Agathos Daimon (literally: good spirit).. The Egyptians also used the symbol of a point within a circle (The symbol of a point within a circle, the sun disc) to represent the sun, which might be a possible origin of its use as the Sun's astrological glyph. It is worthwhile to note that (theta) has the same numerical value in isopsephy as ŒóŒªŒπŒøœÇ (Helios): 318. =Abbreviation= In classical Athens, it was used as an abbreviation for the Greek Œ∏Œ¨ŒΩŒ±œÑŒøœÇ (thanatos, ‚Äúdeath‚Äù) and as it vaguely resembles a human skull, theta was used as a warning symbol of death, in the same way that skull and crossbones are used in modern times. It survives on potsherds used by Athenians when voting for the death penalty. Petrus de Dacia in a document from 1291 relates the idea that theta was used to brand criminals as empty ciphers, and the branding rod was affixed to the crossbar spanning the circle.. For this reason, use of the number theta was sometimes avoided where the connotation was felt to be unlucky‚Äîthe mint marks of some Late Imperial Roman coins famously have the sum ŒîŒï or ŒïŒî (delta and epsilon, that is 4 and 5) substituted as a euphemism where a Œò (9) would otherwise be expected.

Windsocks can be used as a basic guide to wind direction and speed, or as decoration. Uses Windsocks are used to tell wind speed and the direction of the wind speed itself. Windsocks typically are used at airports to indicate the direction and strength of the wind to pilots and at chemical plants where there is risk of gaseous leakage. They are sometimes located alongside highways at windy locations. At many airports, windsocks are lit at night, either by floodlights on top surrounding it or with one mounted on the pole shining inside it.https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/advisory_circular/150-5345-27D/150_5345_27d.pdf Function Wind direction is the opposite of the direction in which the windsock is pointing (note that wind directions are conventionally specified as being the compass point from which the wind originates; so a windsock pointing due north indicates a southerly wind). Wind speed is indicated by the windsock's angle relative to the mounting pole; in low winds, the windsock droops; in high winds it flies horizontally. Alternating stripes of high visibility orange and white were initially used to help to estimate the speed of wind. Each stripe adds up 3 knots to the estimated wind speed. However, some circle frames mountings cause windsocks to be held open at one end, indicating a velocity of 3 knots, even though anemometers would show no wind speed. A fully extended windsock suggests a wind speed of or greater. Standards Per FAA standards, a properly-functioning windsock will orient itself to a breeze of at least and will be fully extended by a wind of .

In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 7. It was derived from the Phoenician letter zayin Zayin. Letters that arose from zeta include the Roman Z and Cyrillic –ó. Name Unlike the other Greek letters, this letter did not take its name from the Phoenician letter from which it was derived; it was given a new name on the pattern of beta, eta and theta. The word zeta is the ancestor of zed, the name of the Latin letter Z in Commonwealth English. Swedish and many Romanic languages (such as Italian and Spanish) do not distinguish between the Greek and Roman forms of the letter; \\"zeta\\" is used to refer to the Roman letter Z as well as the Greek letter. Uses The Greek alphabet on a black figure vessel, with the Phoenician \`I\` shape of the zeta. =Letter = The letter Œ∂ represents the voiced alveolar fricative in Modern Greek. The sound represented by zeta in Greek before 400 BCE is disputed. See Ancient Greek phonology and Pronunciation of Ancient Greek in teaching. Most handbooks agree on attributing to it the pronunciation (like Mazda), but some scholars believe that it was an affricate (like adze). The modern pronunciation was, in all likelihood, established in the Hellenistic age and may have already been a common practice in Classical Attic; for example, it could count as one or two consonants metrically in Attic drama.  Arguments for  # PIE *zd becomes Œ∂ in Greek (e.g. *s√≠sd≈ç > ). Contra: these words are rare and it is therefore more probable that *zd was absorbed by *dz (< *dj, *gj, *j); further, a change from the cluster /zd/ to the affricate /dz/ is typologically more likely than the other way around (which would violate the sonority hierarchy). # Without there would be an empty space between and in the Greek sound system (), and a voiced affricate would not have a voiceless correspondent. Contra: a) words with and are rare, and exceptions in phonological and (even more so) phonotactic patterns are in no way uncommon; b) there was in etc.; and c) there was in fact a voiceless correspondent in Archaic Greek ( > Attic, Boeotian , Ionic, Doric ). # Persian names with zd and z are transcribed with Œ∂ and œÉ respectively in Classical Greek (e.g. Artavazda = ~ Zara(n)ka- = . Similarly, the Philistine city Ashdod was transcribed as . # Some inscriptions have -Œ∂- written for a combination -œÇ + Œ¥- resulting from separate words, e.g. Œ∏ŒµŒøŒ∂ŒøœÑŒøœÇ for Œ∏ŒµŒøœÇ Œ¥ŒøœÑŒøœÇ \\"god-given\\". # Some Attic inscriptions have -œÉŒ∂- for -œÉŒ¥- or -Œ∂-, which is thought to parallel -œÉœÉœÑ- for -œÉœÑ- and therefore to imply a pronunciation. # ŒΩ disappears before Œ∂ like before œÉ(œÉ), œÉœÑ: e.g. * > , * > , * > . Contra: ŒΩ may have disappeared before /dz/ if one accepts that it had the allophone in that position like /ts/ had the allophone : cf. Cretan ~ (Hinge). # Verbs beginning with Œ∂ have in the perfect reduplication like the verbs beginning with œÉœÑ (e.g. = ). Contra: a) The most prominent example of a verb beginning with œÉœÑ has in fact < *se- in the perfect reduplication (); b) the words with /ts/ > œÉ(œÉ) also have : Homer , Ion. . # Alcman, Sappho, Alcaeus and Theocritus have œÉŒ¥ for Attic-Ionic Œ∂. Contra: The tradition would not have invented this special digraph for these poets if was the normal pronunciation in all Greek. Furthermore, this convention is not found in contemporary inscriptions, and the orthography of the manuscripts and papyri is Alexandrine rather than historical. Thus, indicates only a different pronunciation from Hellenistic Greek , i.e. either or . # The grammarians Dionysius Thrax and Dionysius of Halicarnassus class Œ∂ with the \\"double\\" () letters œà, Œæ and analyse it as œÉ + Œ¥. Contra: The Roman grammarian Verrius Flaccus believed in the opposite sequence, Œ¥ + œÉ (in Velius Longus, De orthogr. 51), and Aristotle says that it was a matter of dispute (Metaph. 993a) (though Aristotle might as well be referring to a pronunciation). It is even possible that the letter sometimes and for some speakers varied in pronunciation depending upon word position, i.e., like the letter X in English, which is (usually) pronounced [z] initially but [gz] or [ks] elsewhere (cf. Xerxes). # Some Attic transcriptions of Asia Minor toponyms (Œ≤œÖŒ∂Œ∂Œ±ŒΩœÑŒµŒπŒøŒΩ, Œ±Œ∂Œ∂ŒµŒπŒøŒΩ, etc.) show a -Œ∂Œ∂- for Œ∂; assuming that Attic value was , it may be an attempt to transcribe a dialectal pronunciation; the reverse cannot be ruled completely, but a -œÉŒ¥- transcription would have been more likely in this case. This suggests that different dialects had different pronunciations. (For a similar example in the Slavic languages, cf. Serbo-Croatian (iz)meƒëu, Russian –º–µ–∂–¥—É, Polish miƒôdzy, and Czech mezi, \\"between\\".)  Arguments for [dz]  # The Greek inscriptions almost never write Œ∂ in words like or , so there must have been a difference between this sound and the sound of . Contra: a few inscriptions do seem to suggest that Œ∂ was pronounced like œÉŒ¥; furthermore, all words with written œÉŒ¥ are morphologically transparent, and written œÉŒ¥ may simply be echoing the morphology. (Note, for example, that we write \\"ads\\" where the morphology is transparent, and \\"adze\\" where it is not, even though the pronunciation is the same.) # It seems improbable that Greek would invent a special symbol for the bisegmental combination , which could be represented by œÉŒ¥ without any problems. , on the other hand, would have the same sequence of plosive and sibilant as the double letters of the Ionic alphabet œà and Œæ , thereby avoiding a written plosive at the end of a syllable. Contra: the use of a special symbol for is no more or no less improbable than the use of œà for and Œæ for , or, for that matter, the later invention œõ (stigma) for , which happens to be the voiceless counterpart of . Furthermore, it is not clear that Œ∂ was pronounced when it was originally invented. Mycenean Greek had a special symbol to denote some sort of affricate or palatal consonant; Œ∂ may have been invented for this sound, which later developed into . (For a parallel development, note that original palatal Proto-Slavic developed into in Old Church Slavonic, with similar developments having led to combinations such as –∑–¥ and –∂–¥ being quite common in Russian.) # Boeotian, Elean, Laconian and Cretan Œ¥Œ¥ are more easily explained as a direct development from *dz than through an intermediary *zd. Contra: a) the sound development dz > dd is improbable (Mendez Dosuna); b) ŒΩ has disappeared before Œ∂ > Œ¥Œ¥ in Laconian (Aristoph., Lys. 171, 990) and Boeotian (Sch. Lond. in Dion. Thrax 493), which suggests that these dialects have had a phase of metathesis (Teodorsson). # Greek in South Italy has preserved until modern times. Contra: a) this may be a later development from or under the influence of Italian; b) even if it is derived from an ancient , it may be a dialectal pronunciation. # Vulgar Latin inscriptions use the Greek letter Z for indigenous affricates (e.g. zeta = diaeta), and the Greek Œ∂ is continued by a Romance affricate in the ending > Italian. -eggiare, French -oyer. Italian, similarly, has consistently used Z for and (Lat. prandium > It. pranzo, \\"lunch\\"). Contra: whether the pronunciation of was , or , di would probably still have been the closest native Latin sound; furthermore, the inscriptions are centuries later than the time for which is assumed.  Summary  * is attested only in the lyric poetry of the Greek isle of Lesbos and the city-state of Sparta during the Archaic Age and in Bucolic poetry from the Hellenistic Age. Most scholars would take this as an indication that the -pronunciation existed in the dialects of these authors. * The transcriptions from Persian by Xenophon and testimony by grammarians support the pronunciation in Classical Attic. * is attested from c. 350 BC in Attic inscriptions, and was the probable value in Koine. * or may have existed in some other dialects in parallel. =Numeral= Zeta has the numerical value 7 rather than 6 because the letter digamma (also called 'stigma' as a Greek numeral) was originally in the sixth position in the alphabet. =Mathematics and science = The uppercase zeta is not used, because it is normally identical to Latin Z. The lower case letter can be used to represent: *The Riemann zeta function in mathematics *The damping ratio of an oscillating system in engineering and physics *The rotational quantity of angular jerk in physics *The effective nuclear charge on an electron in quantum chemistry *The electrokinetic potential in colloidal systems *The lag angle in helicopter blade dynamics *Relative vorticity in the atmosphere and ocean *A number whose discrete values (eigenvalues) are the positive roots of transcendental equations, used in the series solutions for transient one- dimensional conduction equations *The heat flux across or through a plane (industrial materials technology) *The Weierstrass zeta-function *In physical chemistry equilibrium computations (using lower case Zeta ( í)), the extent of reaction =Meteorology= *The name Zeta was a name used in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season as the record-breaking Tropical Storm Zeta.

History The letter beta was derived from the Phoenician letter beth Beth. The letter Œí had the largest number of highly divergent local forms. Besides the standard form (either rounded or pointed, ), there were forms as varied as (Gortyn), and (Thera), (Argos), (Melos), (Corinth), (Megara, Byzantium), and (Cyclades). Uses The Greek alphabet on an ancient black figure vessel, with the characteristically angular beta of the time =Algebraic numerals= In the system of Greek numerals, beta has a value of 2. Such use is denoted by a number mark: Œí‚Ä≤. =ComputingFinance= Beta is used in finance as a measure of investment portfolio risk. Beta in this context is calculated as the covariance of the portfolio's returns with its benchmark's returns, divided by the variance of the benchmark's returns. A beta of 1.5 means that for every 1% change in the value of the benchmark, the portfolio's value tends to change by 1.5%. =International Phonetic Alphabet= In the International Phonetic Alphabet, Greek minuscule beta denotes a voiced bilabial fricative . A superscript version may also indicate a compressed vowel, like . =Meteorology= The name Beta was used as a name during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season as Hurricane Beta. It was also used in the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season for Tropical Storm Beta. =Mathematics and science= Beta is often used to denote a variable in mathematics and physics, where it often has specific meanings for certain applications. In physics a stream of unbound energetic electrons is commonly referred to as beta radiation or beta rays. In regression analysis, symbolizes nonstandardized partial slope coefficients, whereas represents standardized (standard deviation-score form) coefficients; in both cases, the coefficients reflect the change in the criterion Y per one- unit change in the value of the associated predictor X. Œ≤ is also used in biology, for instance in Œ≤-Carotene, a primary source of provitamin A, or the Œ≤ cells in pancreatic islets, which produce insulin. Œ≤ is sometimes used as a placeholder for an ordinal number if Œ± is already used. For example, the two roots of a quadratic equation are typically labelled and . In spaceflight, beta angle describes the angle between the orbit plane of a spacecraft or other body and the vector from the sun. Œ≤ is sometimes used to mean the proton-to-electron mass ratio. =Rock climbing terminology= The term \\"beta\\" refers to advice on how to successfully complete a particular climbing route, boulder problem, or crux sequence. = Slang = The term \\"beta\\" has become a common adjective used colloquially to describe someone who is displaying behaviours that classify them as unremarkable and confrontational, often lacking charisma and confidence. It is often used in the phrase \\"beta male,\\" which is used to describe a person of the male gender who does not assert any dominant \\"alpha actions\\" into their character, such as lurking a group chat online without participating or substantial lacking of social awareness. = Statistics = In statistics, beta may represent type II error, or regression slope. =Typography= In some high-quality typesetting, especially in the French tradition, a typographic variant of the lowercase letter without a descender is used within a word for ancient Greek: is printed . In typesetting technical literature, it is a commonly made mistake to use the German letter √ü (a s‚Äìz or s‚Äìs ligature) as a replacement for Œ≤. The two letters resemble each other in some fonts, but they are unrelated. =Videotape formats= \\"Beta\\" can be used to refer to several consumer and professional videotape formats developed by Japan's Sony Corporation. Although similarly named, they are very different in function and obsolescence. * Betamax was the name of a domestic videotape format developed in the 1970s and 1980s. It competed with the Video Home System (VHS) format developed by the Japanese Victor Company, to which it eventually succumbed. The Betamax format was also marketed Betacord by (Sanyo); some cassettes were simply labeled \\"Beta,\\" and the logo was a lower- case beta. Betamax lost in the market and is an oft-used example of a technically superior solution that failed due to market forces. * Betacam, including Beta SP and DigiBeta, is a family of professional videotape formats launched in 1982 that was the de facto standard for professional video, advertising, and television production through the 2000s. The formats outlasted analog NTSC television, and their scarcity today is because the industry has moved to HD formats.

Peterson in San Diego, California, where it is headquartered. The chain has over 2,200 locations, primarily serving the West Coast of the United States. Restaurants are also found in selected large urban areas outside the West Coast, including Phoenix, Denver, Albuquerque, El Paso, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Oklahoma City, Baton Rouge, Nashville, Charlotte, Kansas City, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati as well as one in Guam. The company also formerly operated the Qdoba Mexican Grill chain until Apollo Global Management bought the chain in December 2017. Food items include a variety of chicken tenders and French fries along with hamburger and cheeseburger sandwiches and selections of internationally themed foods such as tacos and egg rolls. History Robert Oscar Peterson already owned several successful restaurants when he opened Topsy's Drive-In at 6270 El Cajon Boulevard in San Diego in 1941. Several more Topsy's were opened. By the late 1940s, Peterson's locations had developed a circus-like d√©cor featuring drawings of a starry-eyed clown. In 1947, Peterson obtained rights for the intercom ordering concept from George Manos who owned one location named Chatterbox in Anchorage, Alaska, the first known location to use the intercom concept for drive-up windows. In 1951, Peterson converted the El Cajon Boulevard location into Jack in the Box, a hamburger stand focused on drive-through service. While the drive-through concept was not new, Jack in the Box innovated a two-way intercom system, the first major chain to use an intercom and the first to focus on drive-through. The intercom allowed much faster service than a traditional drive-up window; while one customer was being served at the window, a second and even a third customer's order could be taken and prepared. A giant clown projected from the roof, and a smaller clown head sat atop the intercom, where a sign said, \\"Pull forward, Jack will speak to you.\\" The Jack in the Box restaurant was conceived as a \\"modern food machine,\\" designed by La Jolla, California master architect Russell Forester. Quick service made the new location very popular, and soon all of Oscar's locations were redesigned with intercoms and rechristened Jack in the Box restaurants. Peterson formed Foodmaker, Inc. as a holding company for Jack in the Box in 1960. At this time, all Jack in the Box locations‚Äîover 180, mainly in California and the Southwest‚Äîwere company-owned. Location sites, food preparation, quality control, and the hiring and training of on-site managers and staff in each location were subject to rigorous screening and strict performance standards. In 1968, Peterson sold Foodmaker to Ralston Purina Company. In the 1970s, Foodmaker led the Jack in the Box chain toward its most prolific growth (television commercials in the early 1970s featured child actor Rodney Allen Rippy) and began to franchise locations. The chain began to increasingly resemble its larger competitors, particularly industry giant McDonald's. Jack in the Box began to struggle in the latter part of the decade; its expansion into East Coast markets was cut back, then halted. By the end of the decade, Jack in the Box restaurants was sold in increasing numbers. Around 1980, Foodmaker dramatically altered Jack in the Box's marketing strategy by literally blowing up the chain's symbol, the jack in the box, in television commercials with the tagline, \\"The food is better at the Box\\". Jack in the Box announced that it would no longer compete for McDonald's target customer base of families with young children. Instead, Foodmaker targeted older, more affluent \\"yuppie\\" customers with a higher-quality, more upscale menu and a series of whimsical television commercials featuring Dan Gilvezan, who attempted to compare the new menu items to that of McDonald's and other fast-food chains, to no avail; hence \\"There's No Comparison\\", their slogan at the time. Jack in the Box restaurants were remodeled and redecorated with decorator pastel colors and hanging plants; the logo, containing a clown's head in a red box with the company name in red text to or below the box (signs in front of the restaurant displayed the clown's head only), was modified, stacking the words in a red diagonal box while still retaining the clown's head; by about 1981 or 1982, the clown's head was removed from the logo, which would remain until 2009. Television advertising from about 1985 onward featured minimalistic music by a small chamber-like ensemble (specifically a distinctive seven-note plucked musical signature). The menu, previously focused on hamburgers led by the flagship Jumbo Jack, became much more diverse, including salads, chicken sandwiches, finger foods, and Seasoned Curly Fries (at least two new menu items were introduced per year), at a time when few fast-food operations offered more than standard hamburgers. Annual sales increased through the 1980s. Ralston Purina tried further to mature the restaurant's image, renaming it \\"Monterey Jack's\\" in late 1985. The name change proved to be a disaster, and the Jack in the Box name was restored in early 1986. After 18 years, Ralston Purina decided in 1985 that Foodmaker was a non-core asset and sold it to management. By 1987, sales reached $655 million, the chain boasted 897 restaurants, and Foodmaker became a publicly- traded company. At their annual meeting in July 2018, the National Jack in the Box Franchisee Association, which represents the owners of about 2,000 of the chain's 2,240 restaurants, voted \\"no confidence\\" in the company's chief executive officer, Leonard \\"Lenny\\" Comma, and called for him to resign. In December 2019 Comma said he will be stepping down. = JBX Grill = JBX Grill was a line of fast casual restaurants introduced in 2004 by Jack in the Box Inc. They featured high-quality, cafe-style food, avoiding most of the cheaper fast-food items typically served at Jack in the Box. The architecture and decor maintained an upbeat, positive atmosphere, and the customer service was comparable to most dine-in restaurants. Two of the Jack in the Box restaurants in San Diego (where Jack in the Box is headquartered) were converted to JBX Grill restaurants to test the concept. (The locations in Hillcrest and Pacific Beach still retain many of the JBX elements, including an indoor/outdoor fireplace and modern architecture.) There were also restaurants in Bakersfield, California, Boise, Idaho, and Nampa, Idaho. However, the concept later proved unsuccessful, and the last stores were reconverted to Jack in the Box in 2006.  Products  Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger Although best known for its hamburgers, Jack in the Box's most popular product is its taco, which it has sold since the first restaurant in the 1950s. , the company sold 554 million a year manufactured in three factories in Texas and Kansas. Alternate Link via ProQuest. What makes the taco unusual is that it is created with the meat and hard taco shell in the Texas and Kansas facilities, then frozen for transport and storage. At the restaurant, it is then deep-fried, then prepared with lettuce, cheese, and mild taco sauce before serving. Besides tacos, other Americanized foods from ethnic cuisines that Jack in the Box offers include egg rolls, breakfast burritos, and poppers. New items come in on a rotation every three to four months, including the Philly cheesesteak and the deli style pannidos (deli trio, ham & turkey, zesty turkey) which were replaced by Jack's ciabatta burger and included the original ciabatta burger and the bacon 'n' cheese ciabatta. Jack in the Box also carries seasonal items such as pumpkin pie shakes, Oreo mint shakes, and eggnog shakes during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. In some locations, local delicacies are a regular part of the menu. Locations in Hawaii, for example, include the Paniolo Breakfast (Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice platter) and teriyaki chicken and rice bowl. In the Southern United States, the company offers biscuits and sweet tea. In Imperial County, California, some locations sell date shakes, reflecting the crop's ubiquity in the region's farms. In the spring of 2007, Jack in the Box also introduced its sirloin burger and followed this up recently with the sirloin steak melt. Its more recent foray into the deli market was the less-popular Ultimate Club Sandwich which was initially removed in Arizona due to poor sales and has since been phased out at all locations. The Bonus Jack was first released in 1970 and has been reintroduced to Jack in the Box menus at times throughout the years, still containing \\"Jack's secret sauce\\". In November 2009, the company discontinued its popular ciabatta sandwiches/burgers. In 2012, Jack in the Box introduced a bacon milkshake as part of its \\"Marry Bacon\\" campaign. The Sourdough Jack, which uses two slices of sourdough bread with a hamburger patty, has been around since 1997 (although it was first introduced in 1991 as the \\"Sourdough Grilled Burger\\"). In October 2016, the \\"Brunchfast\\" items were introduced. Those are Bacon & Egg Chicken Sandwich, Blood Orange Fruit Cooler, Brunch Burger, Cranberry Orange Muffins, Homestyle Potatoes, and Southwest Scrambler Plate. In January 2018, the \\"Food Truck Series\\" sandwiches were introduced, including the Asian Fried Chicken, Pork Belly BLT, and Prime Rib Cheesesteak. Advertising The restaurant rebounded in popularity in 1994 after a highly successful marketing campaign that featured the fictitious Jack in the Box chairman Jack character (formerly voiced by the campaign's creator Dick Sittig), who has a ping pong ball-like head, a yellow clown cap, two blue eyes, a pointy black nose, and a linear red smile that changes with his emotions, and is dressed in a business suit. Jack was reintroduced specifically to signal the new direction the company was taking to refocus and regroup after the 1993 E. coli disaster, discussed below, which threatened the chain's very existence. In the original spot that debuted in Fall 1994, Jack (\\"through the miracle of plastic surgery\\", he says as he confidently strides into the office building) reclaims his rightful role as founder and CEO, and, apparently as revenge for being blown up in 1980, approaches the closed doors of the Jack in the Box boardroom (a fictionalized version, shown while the aforementioned minimalist theme music from the 1980s Jack in the Box commercials plays), activates a detonation device, and the boardroom explodes in a shower of smoke, wood, and paper. The spot ends with a close-up shot of a small white paper bag, presumably filled with Jack in the Box food, dropping forcefully onto a table; the bag is printed with the words \\"Jack's Back\\" in bold red print, then another bag drops down with the Jack in the Box logo from that period. Later ads feature the first bag showing the text of the food item or offer the commercial is promoting (both bags have featured text since 1998). A commercial was released in 1997 where Jack goes to the house of a man who has records of calling Jack in the Box \\"Junk in the Box\\". When the man shoves Jack yelling \\"Beat it clown!\\", Jack chases him outside, tackles him to the ground, and forces him to try Jack's food and confess his deed. The commercial ends with Jack saying \\"I'm sorry for the grass stains.\\" \\"Really?\\" \\"No\\". The commercials in the \\"Jack's Back\\" campaign (which has won several advertising industry awards) tend to be lightly humorous and often involve Jack making business decisions about the restaurant chain's food products, or out in the field getting ideas for new menu items. While a series of ads claiming to ask when Burger King and McDonald's will change their ways about making their hamburgers featured a phone number, the caller used to be a recording of Jack himself (as of 2019, the number is a sex hotline). In addition, many commercials have advertised free car antenna balls with every meal, thus increasing brand awareness. Often different types of antenna balls were available during a holiday or major event or themed toward a sports team local to the restaurant. The antenna balls have since been discontinued due to the demise of the mast-type car antenna. Popular Jack antenna ball (Christmas version) Jack in the Box restaurant in Willits, California Jack in the Box headquarters in San Diego, California (February 2008) During the height of the now-defunct XFL, one of the continuing ad series involved a fictitious professional American football team owned by Jack. The team, called the Carnivores, played against teams such as the Tofu Eaters and the Vegans. In 1997, a successful advertising campaign was launched using a fictional musical group called the Spicy Crispy Girls (a take off of the Spice Girls, a British pop music girl group - at the time one of the most popular groups in the world), in comedic national television commercials. The commercials were used to promote the new Jack in the Box Spicy Crispy Chicken Sandwich (now known as Jack's Spicy Chicken), with the girls dancing in \\"the Jack groove.\\" The Spicy Crispy Girls concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the 'Meaty Cheesy Boys' to promote the Ultimate Cheeseburger in 1999-2001 (see below). At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Girls commercials won the top award for humor. The Meaty Cheesy Boys, a mock boy band to promote the Ultimate Cheeseburger, were created in 1999 during an ad campaign featuring an out-of-control advertising executive previously fired by Jack. The boy band would eventually perform their hit \\"Ultimate Cheesebuger\\" at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. The same ad exec featured in a 2001 spot where a medical doctor made exaggerated claims of the benefits of fast food that it would cure baldness, help trim extra pounds, and remove wrinkles. Jack asks the ad exec incredulously, \\"Where did you find this guy?\\" The ad exec responds proudly, \\"Tobacco company.\\" In 2000, an ad involved a man washed up on a remote island with only a Jack in the Box antenna ball as a company. Later that year, director Robert Zemeckis, claiming the agency had appropriated elements of his Oscar-nominated film Cast Away for the ad, had his lawsuit against the ad agency thrown out. In April 2006, Jack in the Box launched an ad campaign called Bread is Back, taking a stab at the low carbohydrate diets of recent years. In 2006, Jack in the Box took the use of this perception creating a commercial featuring a typical stoner who is indecisive about ordering. When faced with a decision, the Jack in the Box figurine in his car tells him to \\"stick to the classics\\" and order 30 tacos implying that he has the \\"munchies\\". This ad later stirred up controversy among a San Diego teen group who claimed that the ad was irresponsible showing a teenager who was under the influence of drugs. To protest, they presented the company with 2000 postcards protesting the ad, despite the fact that it had not aired since the beginning of the previous month. This commercial was redone in 2009 to feature the new logo and the new Campaign. Another ad touting the chain's milkshakes aired in 2001 and was shot in the stilted style of a 1970s-era anti-drug spot, urging kids to \\"say no to fake shakes\\" and featured \\"Larry The Crime Donkey,\\" a parody of McGruff the Crime Dog. In 2007, Jack in the Box began a commercial campaign for their new 100% sirloin beef hamburgers, implying that they were of higher quality than the Angus beef used by Carl's Jr., Hardee's, Wendy's, and Burger King. That May, CKE Restaurants, Inc., the parent company of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's, filed a lawsuit against Jack in the Box, Inc. CKE claimed, among other things, that the commercials tried to give the impression that Carl's Jr./Hardee's Angus beef hamburgers contained cow anuses by having an actor swirl his finger in the air in a circle while saying \\"Angus\\" in one commercial and having other people in the second commercial laugh when the word \\"Angus\\" was mentioned. They also attacked Jack in the Box's claim that sirloin, a cut found on all cattle, was of higher quality than Angus beef, which is a breed of cattle. During Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, a commercial depicted Jack in a full-body cast after getting hit by a bus. In October 2009, Jack in the Box debuted a popular commercial to market their \\"Teriyaki Bowl\\" meals. The commercial features employees getting \\"bowl cut\\" haircuts. At the end of the commercial, Jack reveals that his \\"bowl cut\\" is a wig, to the dismay of the employees. = Logo = The official Jack in the Box logo used from March 2, 1980, until March 15, 2009 The One variation has a miniature clown hat (dating back to 1978) with three dots in the upper left- hand corner; the clown head was removed in 1980. In the 1970s, the clown head was in a red box all by itself, with the company name either below or next to the box; signs in front of the restaurants had the clown head only. The \\"clown head\\" can be seen on several YouTube videos depicting Jack in the Box commercials from the 1970s and 1980s. Most Jack in the Box locations opened before late 2008 had this logo, although the company is slowly replacing them with the newer logo, along with general updating of the locations' decor. Some locations continue to use this logo as their \\"Open/Closed\\" sign. Controversies=Mislabeled meat= In 1981, horse meat labeled as beef was discovered at a Foodmaker plant that supplied hamburger and taco meat to Jack in the Box. The meat was originally from Profreeze of Australia, and during their checks on location, the food inspectors discovered other shipments destined for the United States which included kangaroo meat. Alternate Link via ProQuest. =E. coli outbreak= In 1993, Jack in the Box suffered a major corporate crisis involving E. coli O157:H7 bacteria. Four children died of hemolytic uremic syndrome and 600 others were reported sick after eating undercooked patties contaminated with fecal material containing the bacteria at a location in Tacoma, Washington and other parts of the Pacific Northwest. The chain was faced with several lawsuits, each of which was quickly settled (but left the chain nearly bankrupt and losing customers). At the time, Washington state law required that hamburgers be cooked to an internal temperature of at least , the temperature necessary to kill E. coli bacteria, although the FDA requirement at that time was only , which was the temperature Jack in the Box cooked. After the incident, Jack in the Box mandated that in all nationwide locations, their hamburgers be cooked to at least . Additionally, all meat products produced in the United States are required to comply with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) regulations. Every company that produces meat products is required to have a HACCP plan that is followed continuously. Jack in the Box also worked with food safety experts from manufacturing companies and created a comprehensive program to test for bacteria in every food product.  Locations  Second Colorado location in Arvada, showing off the 1980s logo Scottsdale, Arizona, shown here in 2009, with the new logo In 2005, Jack in the Box announced plans for nationwide expansion by 2010. In support of this objective, the chain began airing ads in states several hundred miles from the nearest location. U.S. Route 83 is one of five company outlets in Laredo, Texas. Notice the 1980s logo. The expansion strategy at that time was targeted at Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Texas. In 2007, the first new Colorado store opened in Golden, Colorado, marking an end to Jack in the Box's 11-year-long absence from the state. In Albuquerque, New Mexico, several locations opened in June 2009. Jack in the Box restaurants last made an appearance in the Albuquerque market about two decades prior. In September 2010, it was announced that 40 under-performing company-owned Jack in the Box restaurants located mostly in Texas and the Southeast would close. In March 2011, Jack in the Box launched the Munchie Mobile in San Diego, a food truck that will serve Jack's burgers and fries. In June 2012, Jack in the Box launched their second food truck in the southeast region of the United States. Another truck was launched for the Northern Texas area in April 2013. In January 2012, Jack in the Box opened its first of three locations in the Indianapolis area. A few months later, the first Ohio location opened in September 2012 in West Chester. Restatement On December 16, 2004, the company restated three years of results due to an accounting change that prompted the company to cut first-quarter and 2005 earnings expectations. Sponsorship In November 2017 Jack in the Box became a sponsor of the Dallas Fuel And Team Envy, a team in the Overwatch League and a professional video game-playing team respectively.

They are a critical part of modern economic production, with the majority of the world's goods being created or processed within factories. Factories arose with the introduction of machinery during the Industrial Revolution, when the capital and space requirements became too great for cottage industry or workshops. Early factories that contained small amounts of machinery, such as one or two spinning mules, and fewer than a dozen workers have been called \\"glorified workshops\\". Most modern factories have large warehouses or warehouse-like facilities that contain heavy equipment used for assembly line production. Large factories tend to be located with access to multiple modes of transportation, with some having rail, highway and water loading and unloading facilities. In some countries like Australia, it is common to call a factory building a \\"Shed\\". Factories may either make discrete products or some type of continuously produced material, such as chemicals, pulp and paper, or refined oil products. Factories manufacturing chemicals are often called plants and may have most of their equipment ‚Äì tanks, pressure vessels, chemical reactors, pumps and piping ‚Äì outdoors and operated from control rooms. Oil refineries have most of their equipment outdoors. Discrete products may be final goods, or parts and sub-assemblies which are made into final products elsewhere. Factories may be supplied parts from elsewhere or make them from raw materials. Continuous production industries typically use heat or electricity to transform streams of raw materials into finished products. The term mill originally referred to the milling of grain, which usually used natural resources such as water or wind power until those were displaced by steam power in the 19th century. Because many processes like spinning and weaving, iron rolling, and paper manufacturing were originally powered by water, the term survives as in steel mill, paper mill, etc. Reconstructed historical factory in ≈Ωilina (Slovakia) for production of safety matches.

Max Weber considered production during ancient times as never warranting classification as factories, with methods of production and the contemporary economic situation incomparable to modern or even pre-modern developments of industry. In ancient times, the earliest production limited to the household, developed into a separate endeavor independent to the place of inhabitation with production at that time only beginning to be characteristic of industry, termed as \\"unfree shop industry\\", a situation caused especially under the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh, with slave employment and no differentiation of skills within the slave group comparable to modern definitions as division of labour.John R.

Retrieved from The watermill was first made in the Persian Empire some time before 350 BC.

A 10th-century grain-processing factory in the Egyptian town of Bilbays, for example, produced an estimated 300 tons of grain and flour per day. Both watermills and windmills were widely used in the Islamic world at the time.Adam Lucas (2006), Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology, p. 65, Brill Publishers, The Venice Arsenal also provides one of the first examples of a factory in the modern sense of the word. Founded in 1104 in Venice, Republic of Venice, several hundred years before the Industrial Revolution, it mass-produced ships on assembly lines using manufactured parts. The Venice Arsenal apparently produced nearly one ship every day and, at its height, employed 16,000 people. =Industrial Revolution= Cromford mill as it is today. One of the earliest factories was John Lombe's water-powered silk mill at Derby, operational by 1721. By 1746, an integrated brass mill was working at Warmley near Bristol. Raw material went in at one end, was smelted into brass and was turned into pans, pins, wire, and other goods. Housing was provided for workers on site. Josiah Wedgwood in Staffordshire and Matthew Boulton at his Soho Manufactory were other prominent early industrialists, who employed the factory system. The factory system began widespread use somewhat later when cotton spinning was mechanized. Richard Arkwright is the person credited with inventing the prototype of the modern factory. After he patented his water frame in 1769, he established Cromford Mill, in Derbyshire, England, significantly expanding the village of Cromford to accommodate the migrant workers new to the area. The factory system was a new way of organizing workforce made necessary by the development of machines which were too large to house in a worker's cottage. Working hours were as long as they had been for the farmer, that is, from dawn to dusk, six days per week. Overall, this practice essentially reduced skilled and unskilled workers to replaceable commodities. Arkwright's factory was the first successful cotton spinning factory in the world; it showed unequivocally the way ahead for industry and was widely copied. Between 1770 and 1850 mechanized factories supplanted traditional artisan shops as the predominant form of manufacturing institution, because the larger-scale factories enjoyed a significant technological and supervision advantage over the small artisan shops. The earliest factories (using the factory system) developed in the cotton and wool textiles industry. Later generations of factories included mechanized shoe production and manufacturing of machinery, including machine tools. Even more later generations of factories included ones that supplied the railroad industry included rolling mills, foundries and locomotive works, along with agricultural-equipment factories that produced cast-steel plows and reapers. Bicycles were mass-produced beginning in the 1880s. The Nasmyth, Gaskell and Company's Bridgewater Foundry, which began operation in 1836, was one of the earliest factories to use modern materials handling such as cranes and rail tracks through the buildings for handling heavy items. Large scale electrification of factories began around 1900 after the development of the AC motor which was able to run at constant speed depending on the number of poles and the current electrical frequency. At first larger motors were added to line shafts, but as soon as small horsepower motors became widely available, factories switched to unit drive. Eliminating line shafts freed factories of layout constraints and allowed factory layout to be more efficient. Electrification enabled sequential automation using relay logic. =Assembly line= Factory Automation with industrial robots for palletizing food products like bread and toast at a bakery in Germany. Henry Ford further revolutionized the factory concept in the early 20th century, with the innovation of the mass production. Highly specialized laborers situated alongside a series of rolling ramps would build up a product such as (in Ford's case) an automobile. This concept dramatically decreased production costs for virtually all manufactured goods and brought about the age of consumerism. In the mid - to late 20th century, industrialized countries introduced next-generation factories with two improvements: # Advanced statistical methods of quality control, pioneered by the American mathematician William Edwards Deming, whom his home country initially ignored. Quality control turned Japanese factories into world leaders in cost- effectiveness and production quality. # Industrial robots on the factory floor, introduced in the late 1970s. These computer-controlled welding arms and grippers could perform simple tasks such as attaching a car door quickly and flawlessly 24 hours a day. This too cut costs and improved speed. Some speculation as to the future of the factory includes scenarios with rapid prototyping, nanotechnology, and orbital zero-gravity facilities.

Before the advent of mass transportation, factories' needs for ever- greater concentrations of laborers meant that they typically grew up in an urban setting or fostered their own urbanization. Industrial slums developed, and reinforced their own development through the interactions between factories, as when one factory's output or waste-product became the raw materials of another factory (preferably nearby). Canals and railways grew as factories spread, each clustering around sources of cheap energy, available materials and/or mass markets. The exception proved the rule: even greenfield factory sites such as Bournville, founded in a rural setting, developed its own housing and profited from convenient communications systems. Regulation curbed some of the worst excesses of industrialization's factory-based society, a series of Factory Acts leading the way in Britain. Trams, automobiles and town planning encouraged the separate development of industrial suburbs and residential suburbs, with laborers commuting between them. Though factories dominated the Industrial Era, the growth in the service sector eventually began to dethrone them: the focus of labor in general shifted to central-city office towers or to semi-rural campus-style establishments, and many factories stood deserted in local rust belts. The next blow to the traditional factories came from globalization. Manufacturing processes (or their logical successors, assembly plants) in the late 20th century re-focussed in many instances on Special Economic Zones in developing countries or on maquiladoras just across the national boundaries of industrialized states. Further re-location to the least industrialized nations appears possible as the benefits of out-sourcing and the lessons of flexible location apply in the future. Governing the factory Much of management theory developed in response to the need to control factory processes. Assumptions on the hierarchies of unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled laborers and their supervisors and managers still linger on; however an example of a more contemporary approach to handle design applicable to manufacturing facilities can be found in Socio-Technical Systems (STS). Shadow factories A shadow factory is one of a number of manufacturing sites built in dispersed locations in times of war to reduce the risk of disruption due to enemy air- raids and often with the dual purpose of increasing manufacturing capacity. Before World War II Britain had built many shadow factories. =British shadow factories= Production of the Supermarine Spitfire at its parent company's base at Woolston, Southampton was vulnerable to enemy attack as a high-profile target and was well within range of Luftwaffe bombers. Indeed, on 26 September 1940 this facility was completely destroyed by an enemy bombing raid. Supermarine had already established a plant at Castle Bromwich; this action prompted them to further disperse Spitfire production around the country with many premises being requisitioned by the British Government.Price 1986, p. 115. Connected to the Spitfire was production of its equally important Rolls- Royce Merlin engine, Rolls-Royce's main aero engine facility was located at Derby, the need for increased output was met by building new factories in Crewe and Glasgow and using a purpose-built factory of Ford of Britain in Trafford Park Manchester.Pugh 2000, pp. 192-198.

In business, the cost may be one of acquisition, in which case the amount of money expended to acquire it is counted as cost. In this case, money is the input that is gone in order to acquire the thing. This acquisition cost may be the sum of the cost of production as incurred by the original producer, and further costs of transaction as incurred by the acquirer over and above the price paid to the producer. Usually, the price also includes a mark-up for profit over the cost of production. More generalized in the field of economics, cost is a metric that is totaling up as a result of a process or as a differential for the result of a decision. Hence cost is the metric used in the standard modeling paradigm applied to economic processes. Costs (pl.) are often further described based on their timing or their applicability. Types fun  In accounting, costs are the monetary value of expenditures for supplies, services, labor, products, equipment and other items purchased for use by a business or other accounting entity. It is the amount denoted on invoices as the price and recorded in book keeping records as an expense or asset cost basis. Opportunity cost, also referred to as economic cost is the value of the best alternative that was not chosen in order to pursue the current endeavor‚Äîi.e., what could have been accomplished with the resources expended in the undertaking. It represents opportunities forgone. In theoretical economics, cost used without qualification often means opportunity cost. Comparing private, external, and social costs When a transaction takes place, it typically involves both private costs and external costs. Private costs are the costs that the buyer of a good or service pays the seller. This can also be described as the costs internal to the firm's production function. External costs (also called externalities), in contrast, are the costs that people other than the buyer are forced to pay as a result of the transaction. The bearers of such costs can be either particular individuals or society at large. Note that external costs are often both non-monetary and problematic to quantify for comparison with monetary values. They include things like pollution, things that society will likely have to pay for in some way or at some time in the future, but that are not included in transaction prices. Social costs are the sum of private costs and external costs. For example, the manufacturing cost of a car (i.e., the costs of buying inputs, land tax rates for the car plant, overhead costs of running the plant and labor costs) reflects the private cost for the manufacturer (in some ways, normal profit can also be seen as a cost of production; see, e.g., Ison and Wall, 2007, p. 181). The polluted waters or polluted air also created as part of the process of producing the car is an external cost borne by those who are affected by the pollution or who value unpolluted air or water. Because the manufacturer does not pay for this external cost (the cost of emitting undesirable waste into the commons), and does not include this cost in the price of the car (a Kaldor-Hicks compensation), they are said to be external to the market pricing mechanism. The air pollution from driving the car is also an externality produced by the car user in the process of using his good. The driver does not compensate for the environmental damage caused by using the car. Cost estimation When developing a business plan for a new or existing company, product, or project, planners typically make cost estimates in order to assess whether revenues/benefits will cover costs (see cost-benefit analysis). This is done in both business and government. Costs are often underestimated, resulting in cost overrun during execution. Cost-plus pricing, is where the price equals cost plus a percentage of overhead or profit margin.  Manufacturing costs vs. non-manufacturing costs  Manufacturing costs are those costs that are directly involved in manufacturing of products. Examples of manufacturing costs include raw materials costs and charges related to workers. Manufacturing cost is divided into three broad categories: #Direct materials cost. #Direct labor cost. #Manufacturing overhead cost. Non- manufacturing costs are those costs that are not directly incurred in manufacturing a product. Examples of such costs are salary of sales personnel and advertising expenses. Generally non-manufacturing costs are further classified into two categories: #Selling and distribution costs. #Administrative costs. Other costs A defensive cost is an environmental expenditure to eliminate or prevent environmental damage. Defensive costs form part of the genuine progress indicator (GPI) calculations. Labour costs would include travel time, holiday pay, training costs, working clothes, social insurance, taxes on employment &c.; Path cost is a term in networking to define the worthiness of a path, see Routing.

Pole Position is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time and \\"arguably the most important racing game ever made.\\" Gameplay Gameplay screenshot In this game, the player controls a Formula One race car, and has to complete a time trial lap within a certain amount of time (between 57 and 120 seconds) to qualify for an F1 race at the Fuji Racetrack. After qualifying, the player races against seven other CPU-controlled cars in a championship race (but if they do not qualify, the car will stay on the track until the timer runs out). The player must also avoid going off the road so that they will not crash into the billboards. Pole Position was the first racing video game to feature a track based on a real racing circuit. It was also the first game to feature a qualifying lap, requiring the player to complete a time trial before they can compete in Grand Prix races. Once the player has qualified, they must complete the race in the time allowed, avoiding collisions with CPU-controlled opponents and billboards along the sides of the track. The game's publisher, Atari, publicized the game for its \\"unbelievable driving realism\\" in providing a Formula 1 experience behind a racing wheel. The game's graphics featured full-colour landscapes with scaling sprites, including race cars and other signs, and a pseudo-3D, third-person, rear perspective view of the track, with its vanishing point swaying side to side as the player approaches corners, accurately simulating forward movement into the distance.Bernard Perron & Mark J. P. Wolf (2008), Video game theory reader two, p. 157, Taylor & Francis, Development A Pole Position arcade cabinet Pole Position was created by both Shinichiro Okamoto and Galaxian designer Kazunori Sawano. Namco electro- mechanical game engineer Sho Osugi also assisted with development. Based on Namco's experience with producing coin-operated mechanical driving games in the 1970s, notably F-1 (1976), Sawano showed Okamoto rough sketches of his idea, who liked the idea and began production of a video racing game. Okamoto wanted the game to be a true driving simulation game that allowed the player to execute real-world techniques, and for it to use a 3D perspective. He also chose to add the Fuji Speedway into the game to make newer players recognize it when they first played. Music was jointly composed by Nobuyuki Ohnogi and Yuriko Keino. Development of the game lasted for three years. Okamoto recalls the most challenging part of development being to produce the hardware needed to run it, as the game was too \\"ambitious\\" to run on older hardware. The development team used two 16-bit processors to power the game, which Okamoto says was an unheard of concept for arcade games at the time ‚Äî for a while, it was the only video game to use a Z8000 CPU. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani chose the name Pole Position as he thought it sounded \\"cool\\" and appealing, and shortly after filed a trademark for it. The controls also posed to be a challenge, as Okamoto wanted them to feel realistic and to match up with the gameplay ‚Äî Osugi remembers Namco president Masaya Nakamura becoming frustrated with them, having difficulty keeping the car moving in a straight line. The game's arcade cabinet, a sit-down \\"environmental\\" machine, was chosen due to their popularity at the time. The development team had long fights over how fast the gear-shift should be, until it was ultimately decided to simply be either high or low speed. Pole Position was officially released in Japan in September 1982. In November, it was licensed out to Atari Inc. for release in North America, while Namco themselves released the game in Europe a year later in March. After its release, Osugi stated that all of Namco's older mechanical driving games were discontinued, as the company saw the future of arcade racers in the form of video games.  Advertising  The game is an early example of product placement within a video game, with billboards around the track advertising actual companies. However, some billboards were specific to the two versions, such as those of Pepsi and Canon in the Namco version, and those of 7-Eleven, Dentyne, Centipede, and Dig Dug in the Atari version, which replaced such billboards as those of Marlboro and Martini & Rossi, who (although they were prominent motorsport sponsors at the time) would be found inappropriate in the American market for a game aimed towards children. Other billboards appeared in both versions. The game was also featured in a TV commercial shown only on MTV. It was part of a series of TV spots that Atari created in the 1980s exclusively for MTV.  Ports  Atari, Inc. released Pole Position for the Atari 8-bit family, Atari 2600, and Atari 5200. Ports for the Commodore 64, VIC-20, Texas Instruments TI-99/4A, and ZX Spectrum were released under the Atarisoft label. Though the original used raster graphics, GCE published a version for the vector-graphics Vectrex system.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Pole Position on their June 1, 1983 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Electronic Games reviewed the original arcade version in 1983, writing that it \\"keeps the action on track from start to finish\\" with \\"challenging play\\", noting that the gameplay is \\"reasonably faithful to real life\\" Formula One races. They also praised the sound effects and \\"solid, realistic graphics\\", stating it has \\"very rich color images\\" and \\"dimensional depth to the graphics.\\" They gave it the 1983 Arcade Award for Coin-Op Game of the Year, stating that, for \\"the first time in the amusement parlors, a first-person racing game gives a higher reward for passing cars and finishing among the leaders rather than just for keeping all four wheels on the road, thus making driving an art.\\" They also praised the \\"beautiful graphics\\" and \\"breathtaking\\" scenery as well as \\"the two-heat format for the race itself.\\" Computer and Video Games also reviewed the arcade version in 1983, writing that it \\"is simply the most exhilarating driving simulation game on the market.\\" They compared it favorably with Turbo, stating that, while Turbo \\"featured better landscapes\\", it \\"can't match the speed, thrills and skill behind this new race game.\\" They said Pole Positions \\"graphics are sophisticated and believable\\", noting that cars \\"turning corners are shown in every graphic detail of the maneuvre\\", and praised the gameplay, concluding that \\"trying to hold a screaming curve or overtake\\" offers \\"thrills to compare with the real racetrack.\\"Computer and Video Games, issue 18 (April 1983), page 30 (published March 16, 1983) InfoWorld stated that Pole Position for the Atari 8-bit \\"is by far the best road-race game ever thrown on a video screen\\", with \\"bright and brilliant\\" graphics, but that the Commodore 64 version \\"looks like a rush job and is far from arcade-game quality\\". When reviewing the Atari 5200 version, Hi-Res in 1984 found \\"the playability of the game to be limited and the graphics to be the strongest aspect of the game\\". The magazine preferred Adventure International's Rally Speedway to both Pole Position and Epyx's Pitstop. Entertainment Weekly called Pole Position one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In 2015, Pole Position topped IGN's list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever. They stated that it had \\"a drastically better-looking third-person view\\" than Turbo, was \\"the first racing game based on a real-world racing circuit (Fuji Speedway in Japan)\\", \\"introduced checkpoints, and was the first to require a qualifying lap\\", and that its success, as \\"the highest-grossing arcade game in North America in 1983, cemented the genre in place for decades to come and inspired a horde of other racing games\\".  Legacy = Re-releases = In the mid-1990s Pole Position made a comeback on Windows PCs when it was included as part of Microsoft Return of Arcade, and later appeared on the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and Dreamcast systems in Namco Museum Volume 1. Since that time, Pole Position has been included in many subsequent Namco Museum releases. Fuji Speedway was renamed to \\"Namco Speedway\\" in the Museum releases and the plug- n-play versions, except in Namco Museum Virtual Arcade which renamed it to \\"Blue Speedway\\", and the 2004 Ms. Pac-Man plug-and-play TV game released by Jakks Pacific and developed by HotGen Studios, which changed the billboards to advertise the four other featured games. A version of Pole Position was released for the iPod on January 21, 2008. A modified version of Pole Position was released as an easter egg for certain Tesla vehicles in 2018 which changed the setting to the surface of Mars and vehicles to Tesla vehicles. = Sequels = Pole Position II was released in 1983, and featured three additional courses in addition to the original Fuji track. It features slightly improved graphics, as well as a different car color scheme and opening theme. Several new billboards were also introduced. While many considered the three-screened racer TX-1, released in 1984 by Atari and designed by Tatsumi to be a sequel to Pole Position II, the true sequel arrived in 1987 with the release of Final Lap - which may be considered an unofficial Pole Position III. Final Lap would later spawn a racing-RPG spin-off for the TurboGrafx-16 video game console called Final Lap Twin in 1989 - as well as three directly-related arcade sequels, Final Lap 2 (in 1990), Final Lap 3 (in 1992), and Final Lap R (in 1993). On September 14, 2008, a version of Pole Position was released for iOS devices called Pole Position: Remix. The game features upgraded graphics and several different control methods, but remains similar in content to the original. This version of Pole Position also features the tracks from Pole Position II and a new track called Misaki Point. The game has since been removed from the App Store. = Other media = The title spawned a Saturday morning cartoon of the same name. Pole Position is played by the characters Daryl and Turtle in the motion picture D.A.R.Y.L. and is one of the first times in the film where Daryl ‚Äî a seemingly normal boy who is actually an android ‚Äî displays some of his superhuman abilities by earning an amazingly high score in the game. The game is featured in the music video of the 1984 heavy metal song \\"Freewheel Burning\\" by Judas Priest.

For instance a slow shutter-speed often results in a blurred image as the slight shudder of the shutter itself, or the motion caused to the whole camera by the index pressing on the shutter-release button create vibrations that are faster than the shutter itself; this will cause the appearance of the objects in the view-finder and on the photographs having moved when in fact it is the camera that moved. Nikkormat EL Slow shutter speed combined with panning the camera can achieve a motion blur for moving objects. In photography, shutter speed or exposure time is the length of time when the film or digital sensor inside the camera is exposed to light, also when a camera's shutter is open when taking a photograph. The amount of light that reaches the film or image sensor is proportional to the exposure time. of a second will let half as much light in as . Introduction The camera's shutter speed, the lens's aperture or f-stop, and the scene's luminance together determine the amount of light that reaches the film or sensor (the exposure). Exposure value (EV) is a quantity that accounts for the shutter speed and the f-number. Once the sensitivity to light of the recording surface (either film or sensor) is set in numbers expressed in \\"ISOs\\" (ex: 200 ISO, 400 ISO), the light emitted by the scene photographed can be controlled through aperture and shutter-speed to match the film or sensor sensitivity to light. This will achieve a good exposure when all the details of the scene are legible on the photograph. Too much light let into the camera results in an overly pale image (or \\"over-exposure\\") while too little light will result in an overly dark image (or \\"under-exposure\\"). Multiple combinations of shutter speed and f-number can give the same exposure value (E.V.). According to exposure value formula, doubling the exposure time doubles the amount of light (subtracts 1 EV). Reducing the aperture size at multiples of one over the square root of two lets half as much light into the camera, usually at a predefined scale of , , , , , , , , , , and so on. For example, lets 4 times more light into the camera as does. A shutter speed of s with an aperture gives the same exposure value as a s shutter speed with an aperture, and also the same exposure value as a s shutter speed with an aperture, or s at . In addition to its effect on exposure, the shutter speed changes the way movement appears in photographs. Very short shutter speeds can be used to freeze fast- moving subjects, for example at sporting events. Very long shutter speeds are used to intentionally blur a moving subject for effect. Short exposure times are sometimes called \\"fast\\", and long exposure times \\"slow\\". Adjustments to the aperture need to be compensated by changes of the shutter speed to keep the same (right) exposure. In early days of photography, available shutter speeds were not standardized, though a typical sequence might have been s, s, s, s, s and s; neither were apertures or film sensitivity (at least 3 different national standards existed). Soon this problem resulted in a solution consisting in the adoption of a standardized way of choosing aperture so that each major step exactly doubled or halved the amount of light entering the camera (, , , , , , etc.), a standardized 2:1 scale was adopted for shutter speed so that opening one aperture stop and reducing the amount of time of the shutter speed by one step resulted in the identical exposure. The agreed standards for shutter speeds are: An extended exposure can also allow photographers to catch brief flashes of light, as seen here. Exposure time 15 seconds. With this scale, each increment roughly doubles the amount of light (longer time) or halves it (shorter time). Camera shutters often include one or two other settings for making very long exposures: * B (for bulb) keeps the shutter open as long as the shutter release is held. * T (for time) keeps the shutter open (once the shutter-release button had been depressed) until the shutter release is pressed again. The ability of the photographer to take images without noticeable blurring by camera movement is an important parameter in the choice of the slowest possible shutter speed for a handheld camera. The rough guide used by most 35 mm photographers is that the slowest shutter speed that can be used easily without much blur due to camera shake is the shutter speed numerically closest to the lens focal length. For example, for handheld use of a 35 mm camera with a 50 mm normal lens, the closest shutter speed is s (closest to \\"50\\"), while for a 200 mm lens it is recommended not to choose shutter speeds below of a second. This rule can be augmented with knowledge of the intended application for the photograph, an image intended for significant enlargement and closeup viewing would require faster shutter speeds to avoid obvious blur. Through practice and special techniques such as bracing the camera, arms, or body to minimize camera movement, using a monopod or a tripod, slower shutter speeds can be used without blur. If a shutter speed is too slow for hand holding, a camera support, usually a tripod, must be used. Image stabilization on digital cameras or lenses can often permit the use of shutter speeds 3‚Äì4 stops slower (exposures 8‚Äì16 times longer). Shutter priority refers to a shooting mode used in cameras. It allows the photographer to choose a shutter speed setting and allow the camera to decide the correct aperture. This is sometimes referred to as Shutter Speed Priority Auto Exposure, or TV (time value on Canon cameras) mode, S mode on Nikons and most other brands. Creative utility in photography Sparklers moved in a circular motion with an exposure time of 4 seconds. This is an example of Light painting Shutter speed is one of several methods used to control the amount of light recorded by the camera's digital sensor or film. It is also used to manipulate the visual effects of the final image. Images taken with a lower shutter speed evoke a visual sense of movement. Exposure time 3 seconds. Slower shutter speeds are often selected to suggest the movement of an object in a still photograph. Excessively fast shutter speeds can cause a moving subject to appear unnaturally frozen. For instance, a running person may be caught with both feet in the air with all indication of movement lost in the frozen moment. When a slower shutter speed is selected, a longer time passes from the moment the shutter opens till the moment it closes. More time is available for movement in the subject to be recorded by the camera as a blur. A slightly slower shutter speed will allow the photographer to introduce an element of blur, either in the subject, where, in our example, the feet, which are the fastest moving element in the frame, might be blurred while the rest remains sharp; or if the camera is panned to follow a moving subject, the background is blurred while the subject remains relatively sharp. The exact point at which the background or subject will start to blur depends on the speed at which the object is moving, the angle that the object is moving in relation to the camera, the distance it is from the camera and the focal length of the lens in relation to the size of the digital sensor or film. When slower shutter-speeds, in excess of about half a second, are used on running water, the water in the photo will have a ghostly white appearance reminiscent of fog. This effect can be used in landscape photography. Zoom burst is a technique which entails the variation of the focal length of a zoom lens during a longer exposure. In the moment that the shutter is opened, the lens is zoomed in, changing the focal length during the exposure. The center of the image remains sharp, while the details away from the center form a radial blur, which causes a strong visual effect, forcing the eye into the center of the image. The following list provides an overview of common photographic uses for standard shutter speeds. * s and less: The fastest speed available in APS-H or APS-C format DSLR cameras (as of 2012).

The shutter rotation is synchronized with film being pulled through the gate, hence shutter speed is a function of the frame rate and shutter angle. Where E = shutter speed (reciprocal of exposure time in seconds), F = frames per second, and S = shutter angle: : E = \\\\frac {F \\\\cdot 360^\\\\circ}{S}, for E in reciprocal seconds : S = \\\\frac {F \\\\cdot 360^\\\\circ}{E} With a traditional shutter angle of 180¬∞, film is exposed for second at 24 frame/s. To avoid effect of light interference when shooting under artificial lights or when shooting television screens and computer monitors, s (172.8¬∞) or s (144¬∞) shutter is often used. Electronic video cameras do not have mechanical shutters and allow setting shutter speed directly in time units. Professional video cameras often allow selecting shutter speed in terms of shutter angle instead of time units, especially those that are capable of overcranking or undercranking.

It is one of the recognizable signs of death, characterized by stiffening of the limbs of the corpse caused by chemical changes in the muscles postmortem.Saladin, K.S. 2010. Anatomy & Physiology: 6th edition. McGraw-Hill. In humans, rigor mortis can occur as soon as four hours after death.  Physiology  Corpses of the victims of the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone in Sandwip displaying signs of rigor mortis After death, respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle.Hall, John E., and Arthur C. Guyton. Guyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology. Philadelphia, PA: Saunders/Elsevier, 2011. MD Consult. Web. 26 Jan. 2015. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. Calcium enters the cytosol after death. Calcium is released into the cytosol due to the deterioration of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Also, the breakdown of the sarcolemma causes additional calcium to enter the cytosol. The calcium activates the formation of actin-myosin cross- bridging. Once calcium is introduced into the cytosol, it binds to the troponin of thin filaments, which causes the troponin-tropomyosin complex to change shape and allow the myosin heads to bind to the active sites of actin proteins. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. Normal relaxation would occur by replacing ADP with ATP, which would destabilize the myosin- actin bond and break the cross-bridge. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs 48 to 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death.  Physical changes  At the time of death, a condition called \\"primary flaccidity\\" occurs. Following this, the muscles stiffen in rigor mortis. All muscles in the body are affected. Starting between two and six hours following death, rigor mortis begins with the eyelids, neck, and jaw. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis then spreads to the other muscles, including the internal organs, within the next four to six hours. The onset of rigor mortis is affected by the individual's age, sex, physical condition, and muscular build. Rigor mortis generally peaks at 12 hours, and dissipates after 48 hours. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass.\\"Rigor Mortis and Other Postmortem Changes - Burial, Body, Life, Cause, Time, Person, Human, Putrefaction.\\" Encyclopedia of Death and Dying. 2011. Web. 4 December 2011. .  Applications in meat industry  Rigor mortis is very important in meat technology. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determine the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. Cold shortening is caused by the release of stored calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle fibers, in response to the cold stimulus. The calcium ions trigger powerful muscle contraction aided by ATP molecules. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening.  Application in forensic pathology  The degree of rigor mortis may be used in forensic pathology, to determine the approximate time of death. A dead body holds its position as rigor mortis sets in. If the body is moved after death, but before rigor mortis begins, forensic techniques such as livor mortis can be applied. If the position in which a body is found does not match the location where it is found (for example, if it is flat on its back with one arm sticking straight up), that could mean someone moved it. Rigor mortis is known as transient evidence, as the degree to which it affects a body degrades over time. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay. Low temperatures, however, slow them down. Therefore, for a person who dies outside in frozen conditions rigor mortis may last several days more than normal, so investigators may have to abandon it as a tool for determining time of death.Peress, Robin. \\"Discovery Health \\"Rigor Mortis at the Crime Scene\\"\\" Discovery Health \\"Health Guides\\" Discovery Fit & Health, 2011.

It is a settling of the blood in the lower, or dependent, portion of the body postmortem, causing a purplish red discoloration of the skin. When the heart stops functioning and is no longer agitating the blood, heavy red blood cells sink through the serum by action of gravity. The blood travels faster in warmer conditions and slower in colder conditions. Livor mortis starts in 20‚Äì30 minutes, but is usually not observable by the human eye until two hours after death. The size of the patches increases in the next three to six hours, with maximum lividity occurring between eight and twelve hours after death. The blood pools into the interstitial tissues of the body. The intensity of the color depends upon the amount of reduced haemoglobin in the blood. The discoloration does not occur in the areas of the body that are in contact with the ground or another object, in which capillaries are compressed. Applicability Coroners can use the presence or absence of livor mortis as a means of determining an approximate time of death. It can also be used by forensic investigators to determine whether or not a body has been moved. For instance, if the body is found lying prone, but the pooling is present on the deceased's back, investigators can conclude that the body was originally positioned supine. Among coroners and other investigators, such as homicide and forensic detectives, livor mortis is not considered an exact way to measure time of death, but instead is a way to approximate it. Livor mortis, along with algor mortis, rigor mortis, and practices such as forensic entomology are frequently combined by investigators to more accurately pinpoint the estimated time of death.

All calls are answered by 999 operators, and are always free. =Emergency services= In the United Kingdom there are four emergency services which maintain full-time emergency control centres (ECC), to which 999 emergency calls may be directly routed by emergency operators in telephone company operator assistance centres (OAC). These services are as follows, listed in the order of percentage of calls received: * Police * Ambulance * Fire * HM Coastguard Other emergency services may also be reached through the 999 system, but do not maintain permanent emergency control centres. All of these emergency services are summoned through the ECC of one of the four principal services listed above: * Lifeboat * Mountain rescue * Cave rescue * Mine rescue * Bomb disposal (provided by HM Armed Forces) =History= First introduced in the London area on 30 June 1937, the UK's 999 number is the world's oldest emergency call telephone service. The system was introduced following a fire in a house in Wimpole Street on 10 November 1935, in which five women were killed. A neighbour had tried to telephone the fire brigade and was so outraged at being held in a queue by the Welbeck telephone exchange that he wrote a letter to the editor of The Times, which prompted a government inquiry. The initial scheme covered a radius around Oxford Circus and the public were advised only to use it in ongoing emergency if \\"for instance, the man in the flat next to yours is murdering his wife or you have seen a heavily masked cat burglar peering round the stack pipe of the local bank building.\\" The first arrest ‚Äì for burglary ‚Äì took place a week later and the scheme was extended to major cities after World War II and then to the whole UK in 1976. The 9-9-9 format was chosen based on the 'button A' and 'button B' design of pre-payment coin-operated public payphones in wide use (first introduced in 1925) which could be easily modified to allow free use of the 9 digit on the rotary dial in addition to the 0 digit (then used to call the operator), without allowing free use of numbers involving other digits; other combinations of free call 9 and 0 were later used for more purposes, including multiples of 9 (to access exchanges before Subscriber trunk dialling came into use) as a fail-safe for attempted emergency calls, e.g. 9 or 99, reaching at least an operator. US-style rotary phone The choice of 999 was fortunate for accessibility reasons, compared with e.g. lower numbers, because in the dark or in dense smoke 999 could be dialled by placing a finger one hole away from the dial stop (see the articles on rotary dial and GPO telephones) and rotating the dial to the full extent three times. This enables all users including the visually impaired to easily dial the emergency number. It is also the case that it is relatively easy for 111, and other low-number sequences, to be called accidentally, including when transmission wires making momentary contact produce a pulse similar to dialling (e.g. when overhead cables touch in high winds). Hoax calls and improper use are a problem. For these reasons, there are frequent public information campaigns in the UK on the correct use of the 999 system. Alternative three-digit numbers for non- emergency calls have also been introduced in recent years. 101 was introduced for non-urgent calls to Police in England and Wales The scheme was extended to Scotland and Northern Ireland. Trials of 111 as a number to access health services in the UK for urgent but not life-threatening cases began in England in 2010. The main roll-out was originally meant to be finished by April 2013 however, it was not completed until February 2014. In Scotland, the NHS24 service moved from 0845 424 2424 to 111 on 29 April 2014. NHS Direct Wales continues to use 0845 46 47 however the rollout of 111 is in progress, following trials in 2016 by Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board. Currently the 111 number is available in Wales in the following health board areas: Hywel Dda, Powys, Aneurin Bevan and Swansea Bay - including Bridgend. In 2008‚Äì2009, Nottinghamshire Police ran a successful pilot of Pegasus, a database containing the details of people with physical and learning disabilities or mental health problems, who have registered with the force because their disabilities make it difficult for them to give spoken details when calling the police. Those registered on the database are issued with a personal identification number (PIN) that can be used in two ways. By phone ‚Äì either 999 or the force's non-emergency 101 number can be used ‚Äì once a person is put through to the control room, they only need to say \\"Pegasus\\" and their PIN. Their details can then be retrieved from the database and the caller can quickly get on with explaining why they have called. In person ‚Äì the Pegasus PIN can be told or shown to a police officer. Pegasus is also used by the City of London Police, Dyfed Powys Police, Surrey Police & Lincolnshire Police. The introduction of push-button (landline, cordless and mobile) telephones has produced a problem for UK emergency services, due to the ease of same-digit sequences being accidentally keyed, e.g., by objects in the same pocket as a telephone (termed 'pocket dialling') or by children playing with a telephone. This problem is less of a concern with emergency numbers that use two different digits, such as 112 and 911 although on landlines 112 suffers much of the same risk of false generation as the 111 code which was considered and rejected when the original choice of 999 was made. The pan-European 112 code was introduced in the UK in April 1995 with little publicity. It connects to existing 999 circuits. The GSM standard mandates that the user of a GSM phone can dial 112 without unlocking the keypad, a feature that can save time in emergencies but that also causes some accidental calls. Silent solution 55 is the name given to the initiative that allows people to call 999 when they are not able to speak. If there is no answer, the operator will then ask the caller to cough, or make another audible sign that indicates the caller is in need of police assistance. If it is dangerous to make any sound at all, the call will be put through to an automated system which asks the caller to press 55 if they are in danger. =Procedure= 999 or 112 is used to contact the emergency services upon witnessing or being involved in an emergency. In the United Kingdom, the numbers 999 and 112 both connect to the same service, and there is no priority or charge for either of them. Callers dialling 911, the USA's emergency number, may be transferred to the 999 call system if the call is made within the United Kingdom from a mobile phone. An emergency can be: * A person in immediate danger of injury or whose life is at risk * Suspicion that a crime is in progress, or that an offender is in the area * Structure on fire * Another serious incident which needs immediate emergency service attendance All telecoms providers operating in the UK are obliged as part of their licence agreement to provide a free of charge emergency operator service. As of 2014 emergency calls made on any network in the UK are handled by BT. A flowchart for a 999 call On dialling 999 or 112 an operator will answer and ask, \\"Emergency. Which service?\\" Previously operators asked \\"Which service do you require?\\" (approximately up to the mid-90s). The operator will then transfer the call to the appropriate service's own call-taker. If the caller is unsure as to which service they require, the operator will default the call to the police, and if an incident requires more than one service, for instance a road traffic accident with injuries and trapped people, depending on the service the caller has chosen, this service will alert the other services for the caller (while the operator has to also contact each emergency service individually, regardless of whether the caller has remained on the line). The caller will be connected to the service which covers the area that they are (or appear to be) calling from. On 6 October 1998, BT introduced a new system whereby all the information about the location of the calling telephone was transmitted electronically to the relevant service rather than having to read it out (with the possibility of errors). This system is called EISEC (Enhanced Information Service for Emergency Calls). Previously, the operator had to start the connection to the emergency service control room by stating the location of the operator, followed by the caller's telephone number, e.g. \\"Bangor connecting 01248 300 000\\". It was common for the person calling to be confused as to why the operator was talking to the emergency service, and the caller frequently talked over the operator. Only around 50% of the emergency authorities have EISEC, although the number is ever increasing, so, in those cases without EISEC present, the operator still has to pass their location and the caller's number. Although the initial response to all 999 calls is in English, callers who reply in Welsh are transferred to the Bangor control room where the call will be taken by Welsh-speaking operatives. The rooms in which operators work are called operator assistance centres (OACs). There are six BT OACs. The rooms in which emergency response operators work are called Emergency Control Centres (ECCs) and are operated by local authorities. In some situations there may be specific instructions on nearby signs to notify some other authority of an emergency before calling 999. For example, bridges carrying railways over roads may carry signs advising that if a road vehicle strikes the bridge the railway authority (Network Rail in most instances) (on a given number) should be called first to alert the railway operator of the potential of a major incident occurring should a train pass over the damaged bridge. Network Rail has its own procedures to alert trains to the emergency and to stop them if necessary. The instructions on the signs then state 999 should then be dialled and that the Police should be requested. Access to the 999/112 service is provided for the hearing-impaired via Textphone and use of the Text Relay service, run by BT to cover all telephone providers, and previously known as the RNID \\"Typetalk\\" relay service. The number is 18000. 999 is also accessible via SMS for pre- registered users. The service is open for anyone to register and works with all major providers in the UK. =Location= The caller's location will not be passed onto the emergency services immediately, but it is possible to trace both landline and mobile telephone numbers with the BT operator; the former can be traced to an address. The latter can be immediately traced to a grid reference according to the transmitter being used. However, this is only accurate to a certain wide area ‚Äì for more specific traces, authority must be sought and an expensive operation can be conducted to trace the mobile phone to within a few metres. A number of smartphone apps can now be downloaded that assist with caller location by using the smartphone's satellite navigation features. Since 2014, smartphones which implement Advanced Mobile Location will detect that an emergency call is being placed, and use any available location services (WiFi or GPS based location) to send an emergency SMS containing an identifier for the call and the phone's location, accurate to 30 meters. This is intended to be received by the mobile operator whilst the call is in progress. On some occasions callers will be put through to the wrong area service ‚Äì this is called a \\"misrouted nines\\". The most common reason for this is when a mobile phone calls 999 and is using a radio transmitter that is located in another force area; most frequently these are calls that are made within a few miles of a border. Upon establishing the incident location, the emergency service operator will relay the information to the responsible force for their dispatch. In most areas, other forces will respond to incidents just within the border if they could get there quicker, assist, and then hand over to the other force when they arrive. On strategic routes like almost all motorways and some major A roads in the United Kingdom, Highways England have placed blue signs with the location printed on them, at approximately 500-metre intervals. Although emergency SOS phones are placed along the hard shoulder on all motorways (or in emergency refuge areas on smart motorways) which automatically send location information to the Highways England regional control centre (RCC), most people involved in a road emergency call for help using their mobile phones and so must be able to identify their location. These signs contain a code which can be given to the emergency operator or the RCC to locate you quickly. For example, a sign may say \\"M1 A 100.5\\". This translates as the M1 motorway, on the \\"A\\" carriageway, at 100.5 kilometres from the M1's nominal start at the North Circular A406. The \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" carriageways are designated by Highways England to each carriageway, dependent upon which direction it travels; these normally refer to whether the carriageway goes \\"Away from London\\" or \\"Back to London\\". On circular motorways like the London Orbital M25 and M60 Manchester Outer Ring Road, the clockwise carriageway is the A carriageway and the anti-clockwise carriageway is the B carriageway. Letters J, K, L and M refer to slip roads at junctions. These signs are in addition to the pre-existing 100m distance marker posts alongside the carriageway. =Abandoned and hoax calls= An abandoned call is when a caller, intentionally or otherwise, rings 999 and then ends the call or stays silent. Abandoned calls are filtered by emergency operators BT and Cable & Wireless, and are either disconnected or passed on to police. They are normally disconnected by the operator repeating \\"Emergency. Which service?\\", then if no response is given, the operator will say \\"Do you need police, fire or ambulance?\\". If there is still no response, the operator will sometimes ask the caller to press the keypad or make a noise if they need assistance. If no response is given, they will confirm they are clearing the line. For abandoned calls, if the caller requests the police and the call is routed to police and then the line is dropped, either while waiting for connection or on the line with police, they are checked by police and called back. If there is no answer, the police service are likely to attend and if the line is disconnected without the caller telling the operator which service they need, they then make a decision to filter the call to police (if suspicious background noise) or clear the line. The most common reasons for abandoned calls include: * Accidental dialling of 999 on mobile phones. As a GSM standard, mobile phones still allow emergency calls to be made even with the keypad locked. * Faulty phone lines. * Believing an urban myth that says dialling 999 charges mobile phone batteries Ireland In Ireland, 999 (and the European and GSM standard 112) are the national emergency numbers. The 999 and 112 service is able to respond in English, Irish (As the first official language, public services are always available in English and Irish), Polish, French, German and Italian. 999 and 112 operators in Ireland answer the calls in under one second and say \\"Emergency, which service?\\". The caller may then request the Garda√≠ (the Irish police), ambulance, fire service, coastguard, or cave and mountain rescue service. The caller is then transferred to the emergency dispatcher for the appropriate service. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, 999 is the national emergency number. It officially launched on 11 December 2017. This number is toll-free. Calling this number connects the caller to an operator, who then connects the caller to the police, ambulance or fire service. The services are provided under the national help desk, which has been set up at a cost of Tk 60.50 crore. In the past, dialling 100 would connect to Bangladesh Police, 101 to Rapid Action Battalion, 102 to fire services, 103 to ambulance service and 104 to the Access to Information Programme under the Prime Minister's Office. Hong Kong and Macau 999 was introduced to Hong Kong for emergency services (Police, Fire-fighting Services and Ambulance Services) during British rule and continues to be used following the transfer of sovereignty. Macau also adopted the 999 number; it also introduced two emergency hotline numbers: 110 (mainly for tourists from mainland China) and 112 (mainly for tourists from overseas). The worldwide emergency number for GSM mobile phones, 112, also works on all GSM networks in the territories. Calls made to this number are redirected to the 999 call centre. Malaysia The 999 emergency services in Malaysia is staffed by about 138 telephonists from Telekom Malaysia. Like Singapore, the number was inherited from British rule and continued after independence. Ongoing upgrading works are taking place to introduce the Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) for hospital exchanges, digital mapping to track the callers' locations and Computer Assisted Despatching (CAD) for online connectivity among the agencies providing the emergency services in the country. All calls to the number are made free of charge. In the late 90s, the number 994 was adopted as a direct connection to fire stations, but use of the number has been discontinued due to cost-saving measures taken by the government. 991 connects to civil services. The worldwide emergency number for GSM mobile phones, 112, also works on all GSM networks in the country. Calls made to this number are redirected to the 999 call centre. Mauritius Mauritius uses the 999 emergency number for police contact only. The other emergency numbers in use are 114 for emergency medical assistance and 115 for the fire service. Poland The 112 emergency number is an all-service number in Poland like in other EU states, but old numbers that were traditionally designated for emergencies are still in use parallel to 112. Those are 999 for ambulance, 998 for fire brigade and 997 for police. United Arab Emirates In the United Arab Emirates the 999 service is used to contact the police who are also capable of forwarding the call as appropriate to the ambulance or fire services. The number 998 connects directly to the ambulance service and 997 to the fire brigade. Singapore In Singapore, the number 999 was inherited from British rule and continued after independence. The number is attributed more to requesting for the police, with the number 995, established in 1984, used for direct lines to the fire brigade and ambulance services of the Singapore Civil Defence Force. Because most of the population of Singapore is Chinese, it is likely that 995 was adopted because the Chinese pronunciation for that number (‰πù‰πù‰∫î, ji≈≠ ji≈≠ w≈≠) sounds similar to the Chinese phrase for 'Save me' (ÊïëÊïëÊàë, ji√π ji√π w≈è). Eswatini The Kingdom of Eswatini uses the 999 emergency number for police contact only, and 975 for human trafficking reports. The other emergency numbers in use are 977 for emergency medical assistance and 933 for the fire service. Trinidad and Tobago In Trinidad and Tobago, 999 is used to contact the police only. The number 811 is used for the ambulance service and 990 for the fire brigade. Uganda In Uganda, callers can call the police on either 112 or 999. Others * In 1959, Winnipeg, Manitoba (16 municipalities) used 9-9-9 as the first North American deployment of a local unified emergency number. North America later standardised on 9-1-1, with +1-204-999-xxxx eventually reassigned as a standard mobile telephone exchange.

The 2011 census for the ward of Longdendale, which includes Mottram and the surrounding area, was 9,950. Historically part of Cheshire, it lies in the valley of Longdendale, on the border with Derbyshire and close to the Peak District neighbouring Broadbottom and Hattersley. Mottram in Longdendale Parish was one of the eight ancient parishes of the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. The larger Mottram parish was incorporated into Longdendale in 1936, remaining part of Cheshire, then incorporated into Tameside as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 in 1974. Even as late as 1991, the town has the preferred name of Mottram in Longdendale. History In 1795, Aikin in his book, Forty Miles around Manchester, wrote :Mottram is situated twelve miles from Manchester and seven for Stockport, on a high eminence one mile to the west of the Mersey, from which the river ground begins to rise; half the way being so steep as to make it difficult to access. It forms a long street well paved both in the town and some distance on the roads. It contains 127 houses, which are for the most part built of a thick flag stone, and covered with a thick, heavy slate, of nearly the same quality, no other covering being able to endure the strong blasts of wind which occasionally occur. Of late, many of the houses in the skirts of the town are built of brick. About fifty years ago, the houses were few in number, and principally situated on top of the hill, adjoining the churchyard, where is an ancient cross, and at a small distance the parsonage house, now gone much to decay and occupied by working people. It is only of late years that the town has had any considerable increase, which has been chiefly at the bottom of the hill, but some latterly on the top. In the 18th century the River Etherow was known as the Mersey. The River Tame has been a border from the earliest times between the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria and Mercia. The ancient parish was the most northerly in Cheshire. Mottram came to prominence as a transport hub. It lies on two pack horse routes used to carry salt from Cheshire to South Yorkshire over the Pennines and carry lime for soil improvement from Chapel-en-le-Frith. It was on the Manchester to Sheffield stage coach route, and had a flyer service to Manchester. Before the Industrial Revolution Mottram and Ashton had been the most significant towns in the area, the manor and manorial court house were in Mottram, but other towns eclipsed Mottram in size and importance. Mottram was active in the early stages of industrialisation, and there were significant cotton spinning mills in Wedneshough Green and the Treacle Street areas of Mottram Moor, and printing and dyeing works on the Etherow at Broadbottom which until recently was part of the parish. Hattersley and Mottram in Longdendale from Werneth Low The smaller early mills in Mottram became uneconomic and harder to run. Stalling industrialisation led to social conflict and hunger during 1812 Luddite riots that led to the smashing of labour-reducing machines. The Luddites secretly drilled on Wedneshough Green. In 1842 local Chartists met on the green, and planned the closure of Stalybridge factories in the Plug Riots. By 1860 the population had peaked. The 1844 railway passed through the valley with stops at Hattersley and Broadbottom in the parish but not at the Mottram township. A Polish pilot, Josef Gawkowski, was killed on 19 July 1942 when his aircraft crashed near Mottram on a training flight from RAF Newton in Nottinghamshire. A memorial plaque commemorating him is in Mottram Cemetery. Geography Geology of the wider area Mottram occupies an elevated site straddling the A57 trunk road from the end of the M67 to the junction with the A628 trunk road. It is east of Manchester, on land between 150m to 250m above mean sea level. The geology is mainly boulder clay above millstone grit, but there are small outcrops of coal at the edge of the Lancashire Coalfield. To the south and east of Mottram is the River Etherow and to the west is the Hurstclough Brook. =Longdendale bypass proposal= A map showing the proposed route The A628 trunk road connects the M67 motorway from Manchester to the M1 motorway in South Yorkshire. The road is single-carriageway through Mottram, Hollingworth and Tintwistle and through the Peak District National Park, it is used by large numbers of heavy goods vehicles. It is one of the most congested A-road routes in the country, with high volumes of traffic (including HGVs) using a road which is totally unsuitable for the volume and nature of traffic it carries The A628 through Mottram carries traffic from the A57 road linking Manchester through Glossop to Sheffield over the Snake Pass, another major Trans-Pennine route. Congestion at peak times backs up through Glossop and Hadfield rendering local journeys impossible. To solve these problems the Longdendale Bypass was approved in December 2014, but has not yet been started. There is considerable local feeling that there is no viable alternative to a bypass. Landmarks St Michael and All Angels Church dates from the late 15th century. The church is a Grade II* Listed Building, built in the Perpendicular Gothic style. The interior of St. Michael's was remodelled in 1854 but the exterior remains intact from the 15th and 16th centuries. The church stands high up on Warhill overlooking the village. In 2010, vandals destroyed the church's windows which led to cork boards being used as replacements. Mottram Old Hall is a country house in Old Hall Lane which dates to 1727 and was once occupied by the Hollingworth family.

The top-rated television show was broadcast on CBC Television, beginning in 1993 and ending in December 2008. The Air Farce Live name was adopted in October 2007. For the show's final season which began October 3, 2008, the series was renamed Air Farce‚ÄîFinal Flight!. The show was a weekly topical sketch comedy series focusing on political and cultural satire and was one of the most popular Canadian television shows. It was initially aired as a radio series beginning in 1973, and on radio, Air Farce continued for 24 seasons through 1997. In terms of the troupe's TV career, the first Air Farce TV special aired in 1980. A short-lived Air Farce TV series was broadcast in 1981, and further TV specials aired in 1982, 1983, and 1984. After a long hiatus from TV, a 1992 New Year's Eve special for CBC-TV was well received, and a new Air Farce TV series began in October 1993. The TV series was retitled Air Farce Live beginning with the October 6, 2007 broadcast and was the first Canadian sketch comedy series to be broadcast in HD. Despite the name change, the show was broadcast live only in the Atlantic time zone. The other time zones aired the show via tape delay. In November 1998, original cast members Roger Abbott, Don Ferguson, Luba Goy, and John Morgan received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement, Canada's highest honour in the performing arts. Cast history The show began as a radio show in 1973, continuing until 1997 when the troupe decided to concentrate on the TV series which began in 1993. Madly Off in All Directions, starring Lorne Elliott, replaced the Air Farce radio show on the CBC schedule. Over that time the Air Farce cast has remained relatively stable, with three of the troupe's five founders remaining with the program for its entire run. =Original members= * Roger Abbott (1973‚Äì2011); died at the age of 64 on March 26, 2011. * Don Ferguson (1973‚Äì2012) * Luba Goy (1973‚Äì2012) * John Morgan (1973‚Äì2001); retired in 2001, died at the age of 74 on November 15, 2004. * Dave Broadfoot (1973‚Äì1988); retired in 1988, occasional \\"special guest\\" on the series, his appearances becoming less frequent over time on both the radio and television shows.

Died at the age of 90 on November 1, 2016. =Additions= * Barbara Budd (1984‚Äì1991), frequent appearances as a \\"special guest\\" on the radio show * Jessica Holmes (2003‚Äì2011) * Craig Lauzon (2004‚Äì2012), supporting member during 2003, became full member in 2004 * Alan Park (2004‚Äì2012), supporting member during 2003, became full member in 2004 * Penelope Corrin (2007‚Äì2012), filled in during Holmes's maternity leave during the first two months of 2007, returned for the live season finale, joined cast for 2007/2008 season * Arnold Pinnock (2013), who made a guest appearance in the 2012 New Year's Eve special, but was credited as a member for 2013 Show history Royal Canadian Air Farce began in 1973 as a radio show on CBC Radio. It became one of the radio network's most popular programs. Based in Toronto, most of their shows were recorded in CBC's Cabbagetown studios; however, as the troupe became more popular, they frequently travelled throughout the country to record their weekly radio broadcasts, which featured a mixture of political and cultural satire. The Farce troupe recorded a one-hour television special in 1980, which evolved into a ten-week series and two sequel specials. They continued to perform their radio series as the TV series and specials moved forward. Many of the TV show's sketches were actually performed as \\"radio sketches\\"‚Äîduring filming, Air Farce cast members stood on stage in front of microphones reading from scripts, whilst sound effects technician Alex Sinclair could be seen on stage adding sound effects as needed. Other sketches, some quite elaborate, were acted out in full costume as more traditional television sketches. Despite the decent ratings for the initial special, the TV series was received with somewhat lukewarm reviews and ratings. The Air Farce left television after a special in 1984. In the early 1980s, Air Farce's summer radio hiatus periods were filled by another comedy troupe, The Frantics, who later moved on to their own TV series, Four on the Floor. Later summer hiatus periods, however, were filled by Ferguson and Abbott playing classic comedy recordings. In the late 1980s, CBC Radio launched another 30-minutes weekly political satire, Double Exposure. Though the programmes were never in direct competition, some found the latter show fresher and edgier. In 1992, Air Farce took a second plunge into television with 1992: Year of the Farce, a satirical New Year's Eve special. For this and all subsequent TV appearances, the troupe abandoned the idea of performing TV sketches as \\"radio sketches\\", and presented their TV work in a traditional TV sketch show format. A ratings smash, the special led the troupe to produce another weekly television series, which debuted in 1993. However, this time the move to television was permanent. The radio series continued alongside the TV show for four seasons until May 1997, when it was discontinued. The practice of having a New Year's Eve special continued through the show's entire run, and such episodes were typically titled Year of the Farce. Air Farce also frequently had the honour of counting down the seconds before the New Year on CBC, and the show's final episode was itself a New Year's Eve special. Recurring characters on the TV series included the slow Albertan Mike from Canmore (Morgan) and angry Scot Jock McBile (Morgan), self-righteous movie critic Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), and chain-smoking bingo player Brenda (Goy). Though these characters would occasionally feature in skits of their own, usually they were used at the beginning of the show to deliver a stream of one liner jokes commentating on the news of that week. The show also featured frequent skits with politicians, who were portrayed as various extreme caricatures of their most infamous personality quirks. Notable re- occurring figures included Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien (Abbott), who could barely speak a single sentence of English without committing at least a dozen outlandish pronunciation and grammatical errors, the nasally-voiced Preston Manning (Ferguson) who loved to shout \\"REFOOOOOOORM!\\", a screaming, bitchy Sheila Copps (Goy), the tyrannical Lucien Bouchard, the dopey and overly-image conscious Stockwell Day, the strutting, clucking, pompous Joe Clark, and the power-hungry Paul Martin (all Ferguson). Many of the real politicians also made guest appearances on the show, often interacting directly with their parodic counterparts. However, Colonel \\"Teresa\\" Stacy (Ferguson) quickly emerged as the show's most popular character ‚Äî each time he appeared, Stacy would load up the Chicken Cannon and fire rubber chickens and other assorted projectiles at whomever he deemed the most annoying public figure of the week (or year). Morgan retired from Air Farce in 2001, and the remaining three members carried on with a rotating stable of guest stars (usually no more than one per episode). Seen frequently as \\"special guests\\" from 2001-2003 were Rochelle Wilson, Jessica Holmes, Sean Cullen, Peter Keleghan, Janet van de Graaff, James Roussel, Craig Lauzon and Elvira Kurt. Holmes' appearances became more frequent as time went by, especially by the beginning of the 2003-04 season. In December 2003, she officially joined the show, adding celebrity figures such as Paris Hilton and Liza Minnelli, and Canadian politicians such as Belinda Stronach, to the troupe's roster of characters. Later, in 2005, after a lockout at CBC, Air Farce gained two new cast members, who had previously appeared on the show as recurring guest stars: Alan Park and Craig Lauzon. The addition of these two newcomers brought the total number of performers in the troupe to six. While the show was widely regarded as a Canadian institution, some critics have felt that the television show's quality has diminished over the past few seasons, especially since the breakdown of the original four-actor quartet. However, it still continued to draw solid ratings each week. On March 30, 2007, the Air Farce celebrated their 300th episode by doing the show on live television (except in Western Canada) for one hour. Roger Abbott and Luba Goy began the show with a brief history of the show, closing with \\"the scariest three words on television: AIR FARCE LIVE!\\". After this experimental episode, CBC announced that the 15th season of the series would be aired live for the entire season, with a name change to Air Farce Live. The final season retained its live format, but was renamed as Air Farce: Final Flight. =Criticism= Air Farce remained popular through its radio run and initially as a TV series, but over the years interest in the show dropped, ratings fell, and criticism grew louder. The main criticism of the show as it wore on was a general belief that the show was growing stale. The same recurring characters and sketches were used week after week, long after they became tired. The Chicken Cannon became a popular segment early in the TV show's run, but kept being used every episode for years, becoming predictable and often repeating the same jokes. Another criticism of the show is that the actors' impressions, though passable on their radio show, were not at all convincing once they went to TV broadcasts. This problem got worse as the cast got older. The impressions were also often made fun of for being nothing more than thin caricatures of one or more of the politician or celebrity's characteristics (i.e. Roger Abbott's portrayal of Jean Chr√©tien as a twisted-mouthed man who ridiculously mispronounced English words with an over the top French Canadian accent, Jessica Holmes' impressions of Celine Dion as a diva and a whiny Liza Minnelli, and Craig Lauzon's impression of Stephen Harper as a robot). =End of series= Logo for final season of Air Farce On April 1, 2008, the CBC and Air Farce announced that Air Farce Live would end in the 2008/2009 season. Nine new shows, titled Air Farce‚ÄîFinal Flight! aired from October 3, 2008, to December 5, 2008, with the New Year's Eve special as the tenth show and series finale. A special feature of the final season of shows was \\"Air Farce Flashback\\", featuring a memorable segment from the previous 15 seasons of the Air Farce series. The New Year's Eve Grand Finale featured in the Air Farce Flashback segment highlights from several segments of Air Farce sketches over the years. The final hour-long episode aired December 31, 2008, at 8:00 PM Eastern Time. It featured special guests Ron MacLean, Peter Mansbridge, and former Air Farce member Dave Broadfoot. The final episode was viewed by over 1.5 million viewers. =Specials= In December 2009, it was announced that the Air Farce would return for a New Year's Eve 2009 special, featuring the return of most of the original staff (excluding Jessica Holmes, Gord Holtham, and Rick Olsen), guest appearances by Peter Mansbridge, Battle of the Blades winners Jamie Sal√© and Craig Simpson, and the Dragons of Dragons' Den. The special also featured the successor to the Chicken Cannon, \\"F-Bombs,\\" which were dropped onto photographs from the top of the atrium of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. On December 16‚Äì17, 2010, the Royal Canadian Air Farce 2010 New Year special was taped. It aired December 31, 2010. The cast included Jessica Holmes, who returned for the 60 minute show as Yogi Gurt and Celine Dion. The 2011 year- end special, \\"Air Farce Not the New Year's Eve Special\\" aired January 1, 2012, due to several hockey games scheduled New Year's Eve. Jessica Holmes did not return for this special due to a prior commitment. This was the first Air Farce special that did not feature the late Roger Abbott in its cast, who had died earlier in 2011. In 2017, a Canada Day special aired, in celebration of the 150th anniversary of Confederation, as well as a year-end special. While ratings for the specials remained strong, drawing over a million viewers in 2017 and 2018, the CBC informed the troupe in May 2019 that due to budgetary constraints, the 2019 year-end special will be the final edition in the series. It is to be a farewell show combining new material looking at 2019 in review and archival material from the troupe's past, including clips of deceased members Roger Abbott and John Morgan. Sketches=Recurring sketches= Some of the recurring sketches on Air Farce include: *\\"Ad Absurdum\\", where Goy remarks on the terrible commercials aired on Canadian television. *\\"Driving with Alan Park\\", a modified version of \\"Not the Official Story\\" where Alan Park is now shown driving in a car instead of in front of his computer. **This show aired after the 2005 CBC Lockout *\\"A Canadian Moment\\", featuring the entire cast as regulars in a coffee shop. The sketch always ends with the characters saying their catchphrases (\\"You got that right\\" for Ferguson, \\"You betcha\\" for Morgan, \\"Tell me about it\\" for Goy, \\"Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah\\" for Abbott as he pours sugar into his coffee, and \\"Totally\\" for Holmes, typically in that order). This was the final sketch in the New Year's Eve grand finale in which the coffee shop owner, played by Broadfoot, closes the donut shop permanently and kicks out the regulars at closing time. *\\"Brenda the Bingo Lady\\", where a middle-aged woman (Goy) vents her opinions about current issues while playing a game of bingo alongside her husband (Abbott). Each sketch often invariably ends with the husband, who is named Sid, winning, despite playing only one bingo card to Brenda's numerous cards. *\\"B.S. 2000\\", where the cast of Air Farce portray various particular Canadian newspeople as they put their spin on the 2000 federal election. At the end of a sketch, they would \\"poll\\" the public (another cast member playing an anonymous Canadian) and give its results, the gag being that only one person was polled in the survey (and thus one leader would get 100% of the votes, but on one occasion the person abstained). *\\"Chicken Cannon\\". Although originally a sketch in the early parts of Air Farce on TV meant to satirize the Canadian military (in it, the Canadian military consists of only two people, Colonel \\"Teresa\\" Stacy and his assistant, played by Ferguson and Morgan), but as the popularity of the sketch grew, it became an integral part of Air Farce, spawning its own newsroom sketch titled \\"Chicken Cannon News\\". Studio audience members or viewers at home nominate or vote for their favourite target along with their choice of ammunition (not necessarily a chicken). The cast picks a winner and fires the Chicken Cannon at the fan- suggested target at the end of the sketch. The fan also wins some form of Air Farce merchandise for having their choice be a Chicken Cannon target. In the \\"Year of the Farce\\" episodes, a special version of the Chicken Cannon has the top five targets of the year, with the first four being fired upon by a rubber chicken while the top target being fired as before. Past targets included: **Canadian party leaders Jean Chr√©tien, Stockwell Day, Alexa McDonough, Gilles Duceppe, and Joe Clark, for the 2000 election **Olympic figure skating judges, for their part in the scandal that had surrounded Jamie Sal√© and David Pelletier in the 2002 Winter Olympics ** George W. Bush and Al Gore, for the scandal that surrounded the 2000 US Presidential Election ** Gary Bettman and Bob Goodenow, for the furor that resulted from the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout ** Harry Potter ** Ben Johnson ** Alexei Yashin ** Pikachu from Pok√©mon ** Ricky Martin ** Britney Spears ** Canadian Idol host Ben Mulroney ** Former mayor of Toronto Mel Lastman for being a \\"bad boy\\" ** Former CEO of Air Canada Robert Milton ** Then-Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty ** Marty McSorley for being suspended after assaulting by hockey stick in 2000, the only target where Colonel Stacy attacks with hockey stick. ** Osama bin Laden, for his involvement with the September 11 attacks. Note that this is the only known target where Colonel Stacey loads the Chicken Cannon himself. ** Paul Martin and Stephen Harper for their unprofessional behaviour over the past year of 2005 **The Y2K bug ** Frank and Gordon, animated beavers used as advertising mascots for Bell Canada **Then-Canadian Environment Minister Rona Ambrose (for \\"messing up the environment\\") **Former Edmonton Oiler Chris Pronger for being a \\"turncoat\\" ** Karlheinz Schreiber and Brian Mulroney were a tie in 2007. ** Joe Biden and Sarah Palin ** Don Cherry as requested by Ron MacLean when he was a guest in 2008. ** John Baird ** Stephen Harper's house (For not turning off his lights during Earth Hour.) ** Patrick and Jonathan Roy ** Stephen Harper, St√©phane Dion, Michael Ignatieff, Jack Layton, and Gilles Duceppe for the 2008‚Äì2009 Canadian parliamentary dispute. **The CBC for cancelling the Air Farce series and for losing the rights to the Hockey Night in Canada theme music to CTV *\\"Critic At Large\\", where Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me (Abbott), an entertainment critic, gives negative reviews, and takes regular potshots at the Women's Television Network, describing them as 'a bunch of scrotally- deprived, estrogen-sodden non-males', and 'not just because three of (his) ex- wives work there.' *\\"Sister Bessie\\". Sister Bessie (Holmes) is a Catholic nun commenting on various political topics either in the House of Commons or relating to outside sources like George W. Bush. The issues usually make her angry, causing her network Vision Television to block out any obscenities that she may say during her broadcast. *\\"Craig Oliver's 3-Way\\" (Abbott) talks recent news and events with opinions from three other panel members. *\\"Dave the Cabbie\\", where Dave (Ferguson), a cab driver, takes on a fare and proceeds to converse with them on various current events. Dave demands that the fare pay in cash and not with the Visa credit card (often with the line \\"You pay cash, no Visa. You pay Visa I kill you.\\") He also pronounces the I in Visa with a hard I (v-eye-za) and not a soft I (v-ee-za) as is usually the case. The cabbie also often takes the passenger somewhere other than requested and then demands an outrageous price. For a famous celebrity's death, Dave says \\"It's very sad about Mister Rogers. He imitates Rogers saying, \\"Not a beautiful day in the neighbourhood.\\" Although he has a thick Ukrainian accent, he claims to be originally from Regina (The \\"flat part\\"). Although he usually speaks the most, when the client leaves he claims that \\"(he) thought that (the client) would never shut up.\\" *\\"English as a Second Language News\\", hosted by Heikki Flergenpootz (Abbott) and Svetlana (Goy). The sketch is a typical newsroom sketch, often peppered with mistakes that typical ESL learners make. In later years, they typically said \\"Goodbye\\" at the beginning of the sketch and \\"Hello\\" at the end. Each sketch also included a third \\"guest commentator\\" portrayed by Ferguson, some of which would later get their own sketches. *\\"Get Stuffed\\", in which Jock McBile (Morgan), a Scottish-Canadian left-handed bagpipe repair man, put his spin on current events. *\\"I Love that Word Refoooorm\\", in which Preston Manning (Ferguson, although Manning himself has appeared in the sketch playing Ferguson's role), promotes his party, with comical results. Manning was frequently accompanied by various guests (most often Morgan as Deborah Grey, deputy leader of the party, although Grey herself has been a guest) who criticize Manning on his speech. Manning ended the sketch with the phrase \\"I love that word reform\\", with \\"reform\\" being drawn out for comedic effect. *\\"Knob of the Week\\", a sketch in the style of the Chicken Cannon \\"honouring\\" various acts of stupidity by various groups. It was introduced partially to replace the Chicken Cannon, which was specially reserved for the Year of the Farce show and possibly the season opener (both of which were one-hour shows compared to the regular 30-minute shows). *\\"Man's World\\" with Buck McSweeney (Ferguson). Typically, Ferguson is joined by a special guest star (most often an athlete) playing as themselves. Buck proceeds to do a typical sports interview while letting his obsession with synchronized swimming be known. *\\"Member for Kicking Horse Pass\\", in which the fictional Member of Parliament (Dave Broadfoot), reprising his original radio role, performs a solo comedy sketch (as a representative of the \\"New Apathetic Party\\".) *\\"News From Away\\" with Jimmy and Seamus O'Toole (Abbott and Ferguson). Another newsroom sketch where Abbott and Ferguson play newscasters from Newfoundland. There are a number of sketches-within-a-sketch interspersed throughout, common ones being: **\\"52 Weeks in 52 Seconds\\", in which Jimmy and Seamus rapid fire various one-liners based on events that occurred in the past year. It is typically a part of every Year of the Farce show. **\\"Point- Counterpoint\\", in which Jimmy and Seamus try to debate an issue from different points of view. However, one starts the argument and the other agrees on the spot. **\\"Seamus' Commentary\\", where Seamus makes a one-line commentary about one particular issue. In one sketch, he delivered his commentary in the style of a Rick Mercer streeter from This Hour Has 22 Minutes, and Mercer himself showed up mid-sketch to correct Seamus' delivery style. **During the show's live 300th episode, Alan Park played the role of Seamus, because the last sketch had Don Ferguson doing his Rex Murphy impersonation, accompanied by Mary Walsh who did her famous character, Marg: Princess Warrior. *\\"Not the Official Story\\", where a newspaper editor (Alan Park) comments on current events. *\\"Off the Record\\", a sketch that itself parodies TSN's Off The Record sports talk show, with Ferguson playing the role of host Michael Landsberg. *\\"Sermon from the Mount\\", where a prophet (Morgan) proceeds to recall current events in the style of a sermon or lines from the Bible. *\\"Speedvision News\\", a newsroom sketch (purportedly on the Speedvision television channel) where two anchors (Abbott and Ferguson) speak quickly while recalling current events. Similar sketches also lampoon Rogers Sportsnet's and The Score's news programmes (Sportsnetnews and Score Tonight), where Holmes and Ferguson play the roles of the anchors (Holmes plays either Jody Vance or Martine Gaillard, while it is unclear which sportscaster Ferguson is playing). *\\"Liberal and PC\\" a spoof of the \\"Get a Mac\\" ad, Park plays a Liberal (parody of the Mac) and Lauzon plays a \\"PC\\" (Progressive Conservative) and follows the outline of the Mac ad. *\\"Billy Two Willies\\", played by Abbott, a representative of First Nations, asserting their right to sell tax-free cigarettes and run casinos. =Individual sketches= Some of Air Farce's famous individual sketches include: Politically correct version of \\"O Canada\\" In response to criticisms from different groups about O Canada's lyrics, Air Farce had guest star Se√°n Cullen sing an edited, politically correct version of the anthem. The skit was performed on October 5, 2001. The following is the lyrics of the edited \\"O Canada\\". : O Canada, our living quarters and aboriginals persons, including Inuit, M√©tis, and First Nations land : True patriot love, implying affection, but not in a sexual way, in all thy gender non-specific spouse offspring's suggestion : With glowing hearts, we get horny, the true North strong and free : From far and weight-challenged, O Canada, we stand or sit on guard for thee : Non-denominational, gender-unspecified supreme being keep our land, glorious and free : O Canada, we stand ready to sit down and discuss our differences in a civilized manner for thee : O Canada, we stand ready to sit down and discuss our differences in a civilized manner for thee Guests Air Farce has its share of guests, including those who portray themselves. The show generally features Canadian guest stars, or people whose careers are primarily Canadian, such as athletes Doug Flutie and Carlos Delgado. * Jann Arden - Arden was a guest who largely disliked her appearance on Air Farce. She was repeatedly interrupted when she was about to sing by Colonel Stacy, in the midst of preparing to fire the \\"Chicken Cannon\\". Although she got to fire the cannon, her experience on Air Farce, as she described it, was not a pleasant one. * Margaret Atwood - Atwood appeared at the final episode (New Year's Eve 2008) at the beginning of the show. * Mike Bullard - appeared on an episode of Gilbert Smythe Bite-Me. * Brent Butt * Jeffrey Buttle - Figure skater, after he won the world championship in March 2008. * Jean Charest appeared during the 1998 Year of the Farce in the sketch, 'Ottawa Confidencial.' According to the PI character played by Morgan, Charest had all the characteristics to become Prime Minister of Canada except that he was not born by a virgin. * Don Cherry - Appeared for a video message to the show's live 300th episode. * Jean Chr√©tien - Chr√©tien had one appearance on Air Farce, in which he claimed that Abbot's impersonation sounded more like Preston Manning. * Joe Clark - Pays a visit to Jean Chr√©tien (Abbott) to offer some advice, former Prime Minister to current Prime Minister; the gag is that everything Joe says has a word that rhymes with \\"right\\", since he is a Conservative while Chr√©tien is a Liberal. * Sheila Copps - During a New Year's Eve Special, the at-the-time Deputy Prime Minister interrupted the parody sketch \\"RoboCopps.\\" * David Cronenberg - Appeared during an episode of Gilbert Smythe-Bite Me. * John Crosbie * Se√°n Cullen - Cullen has appeared several times on the show, initially as the leader of Corky and the Juice Pigs for a musical number comparing the 1993 Federal election to Gilligan's Island; he also appeared as \\"Quint\\" in a spoof of the movie Jaws. * Stockwell Day * Gill Deacon - Both she and George Stroumboulopoulos beat up Craig Lauzon. * Fred Ewanuick - In character as Hank Yarbo From Corner Gas, appeared on the live 300th episode. * Joe Flaherty - From SCTV, made an appearance in 2002. * Megan Follows - Best known for her role as Anne Shirley in Anne of Green Gables; introduced Air Farce Live on December 7, 2007, and played the role of Sue Johanson in The Canadian View skit. * Red Green - Steve Smith appeared as Red Green doing a Handyman's Corner segment where he showed how to make an angel to top off a Christmas tree. * Deborah Grey - Grey appeared in one sketch on Air Farce, in which she was a guest on Ferguson's \\"I Love That Word Refooooorm\\" sketch. In the final moments of the sketch, she, along with Ferguson (as Preston Manning), sang Auld Lang Syne, forgetting most of the lyrics partway through. * Paul Gross - the star of Due South reprises his role in a \\"lost episode\\" in which he falls for Rita MacNeil (Goy). * Sitara Hewitt - From Little Mosque on the Prairie and You Bet Your Ass, appeared on the live 300th episode. * Mel Hurtig - First political guest on the TV show; as leader of the newly formed and almost unheard of National Party of Canada, he appeared in a game show where the contestants couldn't identify the man, even after he tells them who he is. * Sue Johanson - The host of Sunday Night Sex Show appeared during a New Year's Eve special. Luba Goy, who was parodying Johanson, got up to retrieve a book. Johanson herself returned, book in hand, exclaiming \\"Found it.\\" * Flora MacDonald * Ron MacLean - the host of Hockey Night in Canada has appeared on Air Farce in several sketches, most notably one in which he portrays himself alongside Goy (as the Queen who is impersonating Don Cherry). He was also involved in a sketch where an airline passenger Onex CEO Gerry Schwartz is mistaken for him. Later in the sketch, Schwartz and MacLean (both guest stars portraying themselves), switch seats, and the passenger mistakes MacLean for Schwartz. Another memorable sketch had MacLean impersonate Cherry while Ferguson played the role of MacLean. MacLean also appeared for a video message to the show's live 300th episode. He also appeared in the final program of the series to fire the Chicken Cannon. * Shaun Majumder - Made an appearance in 2002, before his newscasting role on This Hour Has 22 Minutes. * John Manley - Manley appeared in a \\"Man's World\\" sketch (a rarity since he is a politician and not an athlete) shortly after his remarks on how Canada should abandon the monarchy. Most memorable in this sketch was Buck McSweeney's reaction to Manley's indifference towards synchronized swimming: \\"... and you call yourself Manley!\\" * Preston Manning - largely considered to be the first guest star on Air Farce, Manning has appeared in many sketches, including a Blair Witch Project parody. In some appearances, he also pronounced \\"Reform\\" in the same manner as Ferguson, who normally portrayed him in sketches. * Peter Mansbridge - Mansbridge has appeared on several Air Farce sketches, most notably a Man to Mansbridge sketch in which he is interviewed by Abbot (also as Mansbridge). In another memorable show, there was a running gag was where Mansbridge, in his role as anchor for The National, finds himself appointed as the head of CBC while announcing a new series of appointments by the prime minister. Mansbridge also appeared for a video message to the show's live 300th episode. * Paul Martin - Appeared on a spoof of Venture when he was Minister of Finance, and threatened to audit the host, Robert Scully (Ferguson) when he tries to hand deliver his tax return to save on postage. * Sheila McCarthy - From Little Mosque on the Prairie, appeared on the live 300th episode. * Patrick McKenna - McKenna has appeared in various Air Farce sketches, most notably one in which he appears as Marty Stephens, his character from Traders, but with the voice and mannerisms of his The Red Green Show character, Harold Green. * Rick Mercer - Mercer appeared on Air Farce in a sketch where Ferguson, as Seamus O'Toole, parodied his trademark \\"Screener\\" sketch from This Hour Has 22 Minutes. Mercer would first confront O'Toole, then later show him how it's done. * Colin Mochrie - Mochrie has appeared in various Air Farce sketches, most notably as an associate to Colonel Stacy on the \\"Chicken Cannon\\". * Ben Mulroney * Rex Murphy - Rex Murphy guest starred as himself, interviewing Samuel De Champlain. * Anne Murray - Murray appeared in one sketch titled Murray and the Queen, where the two shared their surprisingly similar New Year's resolutions. * Russell Peters - Appeared in an episode in 2005 and the 2015 New Year's Eve special as Dr. Malcolm Sidwell. * Bob Rae * Lloyd Robertson - Robertson, who had once stated that it was an honor to appear on Air Farce to parody himself, appeared in several Air Farce sketches, most notably in one where he, as the CTV news anchor, asks a correspondent, \\"Do you think I'm as handsome as Peter Mansbridge? What about Peter Kent? He's very good looking.\\" * Carlo Rota - From Little Mosque on the Prairie, appeared on the live 300th episode. * Sonja Smits - From the TV series Traders, made two appearances in 2001. * Evan Solomon - Beat up Craig Lauzon. * Elvis Stojko * Trish Stratus - Stratus appeared in one Air Farce show, although she was a part of several sketches, most notably one where she portrayed a stripper in a sketch lampooning the Judy Sgro \\"strippergate\\" scandal. (This can also be a spoof of Trish herself, since she has refused several offers to appear in Playboy) * George Stroumboulopoulos - He and fellow CBC personality Gill Deacon beat up Craig Lauzon over Lauzon's impersonations of Stroumboulopoulos. * The Canadian Tire Couple (Ted Simonett and Gloria Slade) - They appeared in a sketch made to look like one of their regular ads, where they promoted the \\"Baby Power Washer\\". * Pamela Wallin - Wallin has made several appearances on Air Farce, including one in which Goy portrays herself as the Canadian host of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? while Wallin, as Catherine Zeta-Jones, appears as a celebrity contestant. * Mary Walsh - Creator of This Hour Has 22 Minutes, appeared on the live 300th episode. * Brian Williams - then-CBC Sports anchor who has made several appearances on Air Farce, most memorably in which he portrays himself locked in his studio at the conclusion of the 2000 Olympic Games. * David Suzuki - Suzuki's appearance on Air Farce is memorable, as he appeared nude in the sketch (although the nudity was covered by a briefcase and later a desk), a parody of an ad campaign Suzuki participated in for his show The Nature of Things. In his sketch, he is interviewed, where the interviewer (Goy), aware of his nudity, is taken aback by Suzuki's apparent use of double entendres, and later faints when Suzuki asks her if she wanted to see his \\"genetically altered banana\\". Suzuki, clueless to the ordeal, then produces a slightly larger-than-normal banana. * Former premier of New Brunswick, Bernard Lord once appeared in an episode taped in Saint John.

In some cases the air flow is completely blocked, in other cases some amount of air can pass to the lungs. Insufficient oxygen being delivered to the body will result in oxygen deprivation. Although oxygen stored in the blood and lungs can keep a person alive for several minutes after breathing stops, this sequence of events can lead to death. Choking was the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the US in 2011. Deaths from choking most often occur in the very young (children under 2 years old) and in the elderly (adults over 75 years). Obstruction of the airway can occur at the level of the pharynx or the trachea. Foods that can adapt their shape to that of the pharynx (such as bananas, marshmallows, or gelatinous candies) can be a danger not just for children but for persons of any age. Choking is one type of airway obstruction, which includes any blockage of the air- conducting passages, including blockage due to tumors, swelling of the airway tissues, and compression of the laryngopharynx, larynx or vertebrate trachea in strangulation. Cause Respiratory tract. Choking is often caused by an object from outside the body, also called a foreign body, blocking the airway. The object can block the upper or lower airway passages. The airway obstruction is usually partial, but can also be complete. Among children, the most common causes of choking are food, coins, toys, and balloons. In one study, peanuts were the most common object found in the airway of children evaluated for suspected foreign body aspiration. Foods that pose a high risk of choking include hot dogs, hard candy, nuts, seeds, whole grapes, raw carrots, apples, popcorn, peanut butter, marshmallows, chewing gum, and sausages. The most common cause of choking death in children is latex balloons. Small, round non-food objects such as balls, marbles, toys, and toy parts are also associated with a high risk of choking death because of their potential to completely block a child's airway. Children younger than age three are especially at risk of choking because they explore their environment by putting objects in their mouth. Also, young children are still developing the ability to chew food completely. Molar teeth, which come in around 1.5 years of age, are necessary for grinding food. Even after molar teeth are present, children continue developing the ability to chew food completely and swallow throughout early childhood. In addition, a child's airway is smaller in diameter than an adult's airway, which means that smaller objects can cause an airway obstruction in children. Infants and young children generate a less forceful cough than adults, so coughing may not be as effective in relieving an airway obstruction. Finally, children with neuromuscular disorders, developmental delay, traumatic brain injury, and other conditions that affect swallowing are at an increased risk of choking. In adults, choking often involves food blocking the airway. Risk factors include using alcohol or sedatives, undergoing a procedure involving the oral cavity or pharynx, wearing oral appliances, or having a medical condition that causes difficulty swallowing or impairs the cough reflex. Conditions that can cause difficulty swallowing and/or impaired coughing include neurological conditions such as strokes, Alzheimer's disease, or Parkinson's disease. In older adults, risk factors also include living alone, wearing dentures, and having difficulty swallowing. Children and adults with neurological, cognitive, or psychiatric disorders may experience a delay in diagnosis because there may not be a known history of a foreign body entering the airway.  Prevention  In choking, the time to react is quite short, and the worst cases are deadly. For these reasons, it is convenient to prevent it, so it does not even happen. Basic prevention Choking typically happens when swallowing too large or too abundant mouthfuls that are badly chewed. This risk disappears when one obtains the discipline to split the food in pieces of moderated size, and to chew them completely, not swallowing them before. If a food can be chewed, it must be chewed, whatever it is, even if it is very soft or gelatinous, such as spreads and soft desserts. Eating in handfuls (it can happen with foods as popcorn, different peeled nuts, etc.), requires to chew with more control than normal, and not exceeding in the amounts that enter into the mouth. Having at hand some liquid to drink is useful to help to finish swallowing (before the choking has happened).To swallow well, it is recommended that the neck is in a normal position, straight for the eater's body, with the head looking forward, being seated or standing up (not lying or too reclined). Dangerous foods The foods that produce the most complicated choking are those whose shape adapts to the shape of the pharynx or trachea: hot dogs and sausages, bananas, food in blocks, etc. It is easier to choke on foods that dry the mouth (overcooked meat, sponge cake, cold pizza, etc.), which require the help of drinking liquid, or to be accompanied of purees or sauces. It is also easier to choke on foods that are tough (meat of octopus or cuttlefish, major size animals, some reptiles, etc.), they may need to be eaten together with something that helps the teeth to grind them (as loaf bread), or any concrete way to be prepared or cooked. Groups of risk Some population groups have a higher choking risk, as: the elderly, the children, the disabled (physically or mentally), people under the effects of alcohol or drugs, people who have taken medications that seriously reduce the ability to salivate or react, patients with difficulties to swallow (dysphagia), suicidal people, epileptics, people on the autism spectrum, individuals with disorders such as pica that lead them to consume inedible objects, etc. They may require more assistance to feed themselves and it may be necessary to supervise them while they eat. If they are unable to chew properly, their food can not be hard nor tough. If they have difficulty eating normally, it is not recommended to give them food that may cause issues, or to separate it into very small pieces. In cases where a person is unable to safely eat, food can be supplied by feeding syringes that pour a liquid content into the patient's mouth. If the problem is that they have taken any medication or substance that reduces saliva, they cannot eat solid food until their salivation is restored. Prevention in babies and children All little children require care in eating. They must learn to chew their food completely to avoid choking. Feeding them while they do another activity (when they run, play, laugh, etc.) increases the risk of choking. Caregivers can supervise children while eating or playing. Providers such as pediatricians and dentists can provide information to parents and caregivers about what food and toys are appropriate by age to prevent choking. The American Academy of Pediatricians recommends waiting until 6 months of age before introducing solid foods to infants. Caregivers can avoid giving children, when they are younger than 5 years-old, foods that pose a high risk of choking such as hot dog pieces, bananas, cheese sticks, cheese chunks, hard candy, nuts, grapes, marshmallows or popcorn. Later, when they are accustomed to these foods, it is normal to give them split into small pieces. For example: if they are going to eat hot dogs, it is possible to split the sausage lengthwise, sliced, or both. And the same in the case of bananas, grapes, grains, etc. Parents, teachers, child care providers and other caregivers for children are advised to be trained in choking first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Children can put small objects into their mouths (deflated balloons, marbles, small pieces, buttons, coins, button batteries, etc.), which could lead to the child swallowing or choking on them. When babies choke on deflated balloons or plastic bags (as the sacks for wrapping the dirty diapers, the nappy sacks, which are a sort of bag sometimes dangerously placed near the babies), it produces a complicated obstruction that would require it to be directly removed with the fingers, if it is visible. To prevent children from swallowing things, it is needed to take precautions on their environment by placing dangerous objects out of their reach. Besides, they must be supervised, paying enough attention to what they do. It is necessary to teach the children to avoid putting things into their mouths. They may try to eat small pieces of toys. Toys and games may indicate on their packages the ages for which they are safe. In the US, manufacturers of children's toys and products are required by law to apply appropriate warning labels to their packaging. However, toys that are resold may not be marked with warning labels. Caregivers can try to prevent choking by considering the features of a toy (such as size, shape, consistency, small parts) before giving it to a child. Children's products that are found to pose a choking risk can be taken off the market. (How to recognize airway obstruction) Symptoms, signs and times Symptoms and signs: * Difficulty or inability to speak or cry out. * Inability or difficulty in breathing. Labored breathing, including gasping or wheezing, may be present. * Violent and largely involuntary coughing, gurgling, or vomiting noises may be present. * More serious choking victims will have a limited (if any) ability to produce these symptoms since they require at least some air movement. * The person may begin clutching of the throat or mouth, or attempting to induce vomiting by putting fingers down the throat. * The person's face turns blue (cyanosis) from lack of oxygen, if breathing is not restored. * The person may become unconscious, if breathing is not restored. Times: *Brain damage typically occurs if the body is deprived of air for three minutes. * Death will usually occur if breathing is not restored in six to eight minutes. Life can be extended some more by the use of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on unconscious victims of choking (see more details further below). Treatment Choking is treated with a number of different procedures, which form the airway management. This consist in basic techniques available for first aiders and more advanced techniques available for health professionals.US medic teaches the abdominal thrusts to Afghans = Basic treatment (First-Aid) = Basic treatment of choking includes a number of non-invasive techniques to help remove foreign bodies from the airways. Most modern protocols, including those of the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross, recommend several stages, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. For the conscious choking victim, most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps and, if none of these things work, abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver) or chest thrusts. Once the choking victims loses consciousness, initiating CPR is recommended.  Cough  If the choking individual is conscious and coughing, the American Red Cross recommends encouraging the individual to stay calm and continue coughing freely, and it may be easier to take air through the nose to refill the lungs. If the person choking is unable to cough or if coughing is not effective, the American Red Cross recommends to move onto other methods, detailed below. Back blows (back slaps) depiction. Rescuer bends the victim's body as much as possible and then slaps.  Back blows (Back slaps)  Many associations, as the American Red Cross and the Mayo Clinic, recommend the use of back blows (back slaps) to aid in the rescue of choking victims. This technique starts by bending the choking victim forward as much as possible, even trying to place his head lower than the chest, to avoid the risk of the slaps could drive the object deeper into the person's throat (that is a rare complication, but possible). The bending is in the back, the neck should not be excessively bent. Back blows are performed by delivering forceful slaps with the heel of the hand on the victim's back, between the shoulder blades. The back slaps push behind the blockage, being able to dislodge the foreign object. In some cases, the physical vibration of the action may cause enough movement of the object to assist the patient in clearing the airway.  Abdominal Thrusts (Heimlich Maneuver)  Abdominal thrusts anti-choking technique: apply them on the area located between the chest and the belly button. Abdominal thrusts are performed with the rescuer standing behind the choking victim. The rescuer closes his skillful hand, grasps it with the other hand, and presses forcefully inwards and upwards with both of them on the area located between the chest and the belly button of the victim. The pressure is not focused directly against the ribs, to avoid breaking any of them. If the first thrust doesn't solve the choking, it can be repeated several times. Usage of abdominal thrusts is not recommended in infants under 1 year of age due to risk of causing injury; there exist adapted techniques for them (see more further below). Abdominal thrusts should not be used, either, when the patient's abdomen presents problems to receive them, like pregnancy or excessive size; then chest thrusts are advised (see further below). The purpose of abdominal thrusts is to create a pressure capable to expel the object lodged upwards in the airway, relieving the obstruction. This method was discovered by Dr. Henry Heimlich in 1974, so it is referred to as \\"The Heimlich Maneuver.\\" Dr. Henry Heimlich claimed that his maneuver was better than the back blows, arguing that back blows could cause the obstruction to become more deeply lodged in the victim's airway. That claim started a debate into the medical community, that ended up with the recommendation of alternating both techniques, but making the patient to bend the back before receiving the slaps. So the Heimlich Maneuver itself uses only abdominal thrusts, but is also part of anti-choking protocols that include the back blows (back slaps) technique. Chest thrusts anti-choking technique: if the victim can not receive thrusts on the abdomen, use chest thrusts; apply them on the lower half of the chest bone, but not in the very endpoint.  Chest thrusts  When abdominal thrusts can not be performed on the victim (in case of pregnant or too obese victims, and others) chest thrusts are advised instead. Chest thrusts are performed with the rescuer standing behind the choking victim. The rescuer closes his skillful hand and grasp it with the other hand. This can produce several kinds of fists, but any of them can be valid if it can be placed on the chest of the victim without sinking there a knuckle too painfully. Keeping the fist with both hands, the rescuer uses it to press forcefully inwards on the lower half of the chest bone (approximately), but not in the very endpoint (which is the xiphoid process). It can be noted, as a general reference, that, when the victim is a woman, the zone of pressure of the chest thrusts would be normally upper than the level of the breasts. The pressure is not focused against the xiphoid process, to avoid breaking it. If the first thrust doesn't solve the choking, it can be repeated several times.  \\"Five and Five\\" strategy  The American Red Cross recommends a protocol of alternating five back blows and five abdominal thrusts for conscious choking victims until the object blocking the airway is dislodged. For pregnant or too obese victims, the protocol is the same, but chest thrusts are advised instead of the abdominal ones. If the victim becomes unconscious, basic CPR is recommended. Anyway, it's convenient to make someone call to emergency medical services before it happens. The Red Cross does not specifically refer to its choking victim protocol as the \\"Five and Five Technique\\", and it differs from the Heimlich Maneuver since it includes administering back blows to the victim, contrary to Dr. Heimlich's procedure which specifically omitted back blows and was based only on his technique.  Anti-choking devices  During the 2010-2020 decade, some effective anti-choking devices have been developed and released to the market. They have superseded primitive inventions appeared during the 20th century. The current anti-choking devices have some advantages compared with manual techniques. The usage of these devices is always quite easy. They can be especially useful in difficult cases, like disabled patients, elderly people, unconscious victims or when the victim is oneself. Also, they can be helpful in public places and crowded events. And, finally, they achieve levels of pressure in suction that can not be matched by manual methods. In the worst choking cases, no manual technique would dislodge the foreign object, being necessary the usage of one of these devices or a sort of surgery. That's why physicians recommend to put some care in eating. The design of these devices is based in a vacuum mechanical effect, with no need of batteries or electric current. They usually present an attached mask, in order to make a vacuum from the patient's nose and mouth. The current models of anti-choking devices are quite similar: a direct plunger tool (LifeVac), or a vacuum syringe (backward syringe) that keeps the tongue in place by inserting a tube in the mouth (Dechoker). Both have received certifications and have been proven effective in many real cases reported by the media. Some other mechanical models are in development, this is the case of Lifewand (now being released to market), which makes the vacuum by direct pressure against patient's face, and the prototype of Dr. De Luca (now seeking funds ), which uses a button. The challenges for the future of the anti-choking inventions are just to improve their portability reducing more their size and to develop a device that specifically works in babies (despite all the previous ones have any model for little children).  Unconscious victims  Chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). When a choking victim becomes unconscious, it's mandatory to call to emergency medical services if this has not been done yet. Rescue breaths of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). For the rest, an unconscious choking victim should receive a first-aid treatment that is similar to the case of any other non-breathing patient: a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), alternating series of around 30 compressions (on the lower half of the chest bone) with series of 2 rescue breaths (pinching the victim's nose and puffing air inside of the mouth; it's also possible to tilt the victim's head up or down and give 2 additional breaths, so the air could find an entrance through the blockage). The difference between CPR in choking victims and a normal CPR is that CPR in choking victims includes an attempt to remove the obstructing object (mainly using finger sweeping when the object is already visible) at the end of each compressions serie. The chest compressions of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) produce coincidentally the same anti-choking effect than the chest thrusts technique, so the CPR itself could expel the object. If the object is expelled and followingly removed, CPR must continue until the victim recovers breathing. Babies (infants under 1 year old) require a special adaptation of the procedure (described further below). An anti-choking device can unblock the airway on unconscious victims, but not necessarily can take the obstructing object out of the mouth (it may need a manual removal). Anyway, the victim will require cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after that, as it has been described above, but only alternating the 30 compressions and the 2 rescue breaths.  About the finger sweeping in unconscious victims  In unconscious victims of choking, the American Medical Association advocates sweeping the fingers across the back of the throat to attempt to dislodge airway obstructions. However, many modern protocols recommend against the use of the finger sweep. Red Cross procedures specifically direct rescuers not to perform a finger sweep unless an object can be clearly seen in the victim's mouth due to the risk of driving the obstruction deeper into the victim's airway. Other protocols suggest that if the patient is conscious they will be able to remove the foreign object themselves, or if they are unconscious, the rescuer should simply place them in the recovery position as this allows (to a certain extent) the drainage of fluids out of the mouth instead of down the trachea due to gravity. There is also a risk of causing further damage (for instance inducing vomiting) by using a finger sweep technique. There are no studies that have examined the usefulness of the finger sweep technique when there is no visible object in the airway. Recommendations for the use of the finger sweep have been based on anecdotal evidence. = In special populations = Babies (under 1 year old)  For babies (infants under 1 year old), the American Heart Association recommends to perform cycles of back blows (5 back slaps) followed by chest thrusts (5 chest compressions, that are adapted).400x400pxIn the back blows, it's recommended that, before applying them, the baby is slightly leaned upside-down, being supported by a forearm of the rescuer and its respective hand (the baby's head must be carefully held in this maneuver, usually from the jaw). To achieve this position, the rescuer can sit down on any seat with the baby, so the baby's body (supported by the forearm and hand of the rescuer) can be leaned along the rescuer's thighs. As an alternative to this (in case of the baby is too big or any other problem), the rescuer can sit on a bed or sofa, or even on the floor (when no seat is near), supporting on the lap the baby's body, to make the upside-down leaning from the lap, at the right or at the left. If the rescuer can not sit down, at least could try to do the maneuver low over a soft surface (to reduce a possible fall). In case of the previous options are not possible, but the rescuer is skillful enough, the rescuer can still kneel on a knee, and place the baby's body along the thigh that is higher (with the forearm still supporting between the thigh and the baby), so the baby can be leaned a bit moving forward that thigh. When the baby is already leaned (using any of the systems), the rescuer applies the slaps. In the chest thrusts maneuver, the baby's body is placed lying. Then the rescuer does the compressions on the chest bone, pressing with only two fingers on its lower half (the nearer to the abdomen). Abdominal thrusts are not recommended in children less than 1 year, because they can cause liver damage. The cycles of 5 back blows and 5 chest compressions are alternated until the object comes out of the infant's airway or until the infant becomes unconscious. If the infant becomes unconscious, the American Heart Association recommends starting a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which must be adapted to babies. In that procedure, the baby is placed face up on a horizontal surface, with the head in straight position (tilting too much a baby's head backwards can close the access to the trachea). Then it must be applied an alternating cycle of 30 chest compressions (but modified: the rescuer presses with only two fingers in the lower part of the chest bone), and 2 rescue breaths (also modified: the rescuer's mouth puffs air covering the baby's mouth and nose at the same time). Between chest compressions and rescue breaths, the rescuer looks into the mouth searching if the obstructing object has come out (because of the effect of the compressions) and, if it is visible, attempts to extract it (mainly using a finger sweeping). If the object is extracted, the cardiopulmonary resuscitation continues until the baby's breath is successfully recovered or until medical services arrive.  Pregnant or too obese people  The American Heart Association recommends the chest thrusts rather than the abdominal thrusts for pregnant or too obese persons who are choking. Chest thrusts are performed in a similar way to the abdominal thrusts, but with the hands placed on the lower part of the choking victim's chest, at the lower half of the breast bone (sternum), rather than over the middle of the abdomen, as in the traditional abdominal thrusts. Strong inward thrusts are then applied. As a reference, in women, the zone of pressure of the chest thrusts (the lower half of sternum) would be normally upper than the level of the breasts. The chest thrusts can be alternated with back blows (back slaps), which are applied on the back of the victim when it is very bent forward.  Disabled people in wheelchair  If the choking victim is a disabled person and is using a wheelchair, the first-aid procedure is quite similar than in the case of the other victims. The difference is in trying to apply the techniques directly, while the victim is still seated on the wheelchair. The back blows (back slaps) can be used after bending forward the back of the victim very much, as much as possible. To perform the abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver), the back of the victim must be bent too, and the rescuer has to get behind the wheelchair. Then, the rescuer can embrace the victim's abdomen from behind and up, leaning over the top of the wheelchair's backrest. If this is too difficult, the rescuer can get down to embrace the victim's abdomen and the wheelchair's backrest all together. The same can be tried from a side or in another way. Finally, the rescuer has to apply the sudden inward and upward pressures on the abdomen. It must be remembered that, if the victim can not receive abdominal thrusts (this is the case of the pregnant or too obese people), chest thrusts must be used instead. They are applied while the victim is in the wheelchair too, but making sudden inward pressures on the lower part of the chest bone against the wheelchair's backrest and the rescuer's body. If there are difficulties for this, the same maneuver can be tried from a side or in another way. Due to the additional difficulties in helping to the disabled, it is convenient to avoid placing them in too narrow and encased spaces at the mealtimes. The opened spaces give an easier access to them for the rescuers. The presence of an anti-choking device at hand can be specially useful when a disabled person is near. = Self-treatment = Head-down position for self-treatment of choking if other approaches fail The Heimlich Maneuver (abdominal thrusts) can be performed or can be self-administered. Self-administration of this maneuver requires positioning of one's own abdomen over a chair, railing, or countertop and driving the abdomen upon the object with sharp, upward thrust. This serves as a substitute for thrusts made with the hands by another person. One study showed that these self-administered abdominal thrusts were just as effective as those performed by another person, although obese individuals were not included in the study. Alternatively, multiple sources of evidence suggest that one of promising approaches for self treatment during choking could be by applying the head-down (inverse) position. On the other hand, using a modern anti-choking device is one the best, and most realistic, options for self- treatment in case of suffering a serious choking episode. = Advanced treatment = There are many advanced medical treatments to relieve choking or airway obstruction. These include inspection of the airway with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope and removal of the object under direct vision. Severe cases where there is an inability to remove the object may require cricothyrotomy (emergency tracheostomy). Cricothyrotomy involves making an incision in a patient's neck and inserting a tube into the trachea in order to bypass the upper airways. The procedure is usually only performed when other methods have failed. In many cases, an emergency tracheostomy can save a patient's life, but if performed incorrectly, it may end the patient's life.  Epidemiology  Choking is the fourth most common cause of unintentional injury-related death in the US. Many episodes are not reported because they are brief and resolve without seeking medical attention. Among reported events, the majority of episodes (80%) occur among children younger than age 15, with fewer episodes (20%) among age 15 and older. The death rate from choking is low at most ages but increases starting around age 74. Choking due to a foreign object resulted in 162,000 deaths (2.5 per 100,000) in 2013, compared to 140,000 deaths (2.9 per 100,000) in 1990.

(n√©e Thomas; 25 March 1927 ‚Äì 15 March 2016) was an English television and film producer, writer, voice actress and costume designer, best known for her collaborations with Gerry Anderson, her husband between 1960 and 1981. In addition to serving as co-creator and co-writer on their TV series during the 1960s and early 1970s, Anderson's primary contribution was character development and costume design. She regularly directed the bi-weekly voice recording sessions, and provided the voices of many female and child characters, in particular the creation of Lady Penelope and Parker in Thunderbirds. Early life Anderson was born in Camberwell, London, England, on 25 March 1927. Her father, Sidney Thomas, was a champion boxer, and her mother, Beatrice (n√©e Aberdeen), a dressmaker. After graduating from the London School of Economics with a degree in sociology and political science, she became a social worker. She emigrated to the United States to live with her first husband, an American golfer. While in America she worked as a journalist. Career Anderson returned to the United Kingdom in 1955 with her daughter. She joined the newly founded and short-lived Polytechnic Films as an office assistant in 1957. There, she met Gerry Anderson, an editor and director. That year, when Anderson and Arthur Provis created AP Films following Polytechnic's collapse, she joined them on the board of directors of the new company, alongside their colleagues John Read and Reg Hill. =Collaboration with Gerry Anderson= In 1957 AP Films was commissioned by writer Roberta Leigh to produce films based on her children's stories, including The Adventures of Twizzle and Torchy the Battery Boy. Sylvia Anderson worked on these projects as a production assistant. In late 1960 the couple married,England and Wales Civil Marriages Register Q4 1960, Westminster, Ref: 5c/679 and she developed a wider role in production duties. The couple worked together as a team, co-writing and co-creating the first episode of a series then sharing the work according to their strengths. Gerry tended to specialise in special effects and hardware, and Sylvia in character, voices, costume, dialogue, and plotlines. In this way, Anderson contributed plot development and voice work for a series of half-hour shows including Supercar, Stingray and Fireball XL5. However, she felt the half-hour format was insufficient to fully develop characters and stories, and she persuaded the team's TV producer Lew Grade to extend their shows to a full hour. In the early 1960s, the Andersons co-created the series Thunderbirds, and Sylvia created the characters. She was aware that Grade intended to sell the show to American TV networks and wanted to make the show appealing to American audiences, hence she introduced the \\"British aristocrat\\" character of Lady Penelope, and Parker her \\"Cockney chauffeur\\". Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an aristocratic fashionista who was an undercover agent, was to become one of her most popular characters; Anderson both created the character and provided her voice. AP Films puppet designer Mary Turner used Anderson as the template for the creation of the Lady Penelope puppets, a decision of which Anderson was not immediately aware. Interviewed by the Daily Mirror in 1968, Turner commented: \\"we wanted a glamorous blonde and [Anderson] was the obvious choice.\\" In 1966 and 1968, Anderson produced two feature-length films based on the Thunderbirds story, Thunderbirds Are Go and Thunderbird 6. She was co- creator with Gerry Anderson for the series UFO (1969-1970) on which she co- produced, was responsible for fashions on the show and did the majority of the casting. The Andersons' creative partnership ended when their marriage broke down during the production of the first series of Space: 1999 in 1975. Gerry announced his intention to separate on the evening of the wrap party, following which Sylvia ceased her involvement with the company, which by this time had twice been renamed and was now called Group Three. =Talent scout and writing= In 1983 she published a novel titled Love and Hisses and in 1994 she reprised her voice role as Lady Penelope for an episode of Absolutely Fabulous. She worked as a London-based talent scout for HBO for 30 years. Her autobiography, Yes M'Lady, was first published in 1991; in 2007, it was re- published as My FAB Years with new material to bring it up to date with the latest developments in her life, such as her role as a production consultant for the 2004 live-action film adaptation of Thunderbirds. Of the film, Anderson commented, \\"I'm personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen.\\" My FAB Years was re-released as a spoken CD, narrated by Anderson, in 2010. =Late career and charity work= In 2013, Anderson worked with her daughter Dee, a jazz singer, on a concept for a new TV series named The Last Station. They set up a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo for followers to contribute and be a part of the series. In 2015, Anderson briefly returned to the Thunderbirds universe, when she guest-starred in an episode of the reboot TV series, Thunderbirds Are Go, as Great Aunt Sylvia, a relative of Lady Penelope. Anderson was also known for her charity work, particularly in support of Breast Cancer Care and Barnardo's. =Recognition= In 1966, Thunderbirds received the Royal Television Society Silver Medal. In 2015, Anderson travelled to Italy to receive a Pulcinella Award in recognition of her career in television production. Personal life and death Anderson married Jack Brooks in 1946 with whom she had a daughter, Dee. She remarried in 1952 to George Thamm, which also resulted in divorce. She married for a third time in 1960 to Gerry Anderson, with whom she had a son, Gerry Anderson Jr before divorcing in 1980.Obituary , theguardian.com; accessed 19 March 2016.

It rises in the Grampians and flows eastwards, through Aberdeenshire, to the North Sea at Aberdeen. The Don passes through Alford, Kemnay, Inverurie, Kintore, and Dyce. Its main tributary, the River Ury, joins at Inverurie. Course of the river The Don rises in the peat flat beneath Druim na Feithe, and in the shadow of Glen Avon, before flowing quietly past the ice-age moraine and down to Cock Bridge, below the picturesque site of the recently demolished Delnadamph Lodge. Several streams, the Dhiver, Feith Bhait, Meoir Veannaich, Cock Burn and the Allt nan Aighean merge to form the embryonic Don. Water from the north of Brown Cow Hill () drains into the Don, while water from the west side runs into the River Spey and that from the south side into the Dee. The Don follows a circuitous route eastwards past Corgarff Castle, through Strathdon and the Howe of Alford before entering the North Sea just north of Old Aberdeen. The chief tributaries are Conrie Water, Ernan Water, Water of Carvie, Water of Nochty, Deskry Water, Water of Buchat, Kindy Burn, Bucks Burn, Mossat Burn, Leochel Burn and the River Ury. History The river was recorded by the 2nd century AD cosmographer Ptolemy of Alexandria (d. c 168) as ŒîŒ∑ŒøœÖŒ±ŒΩŒ± Devona,Strang, Alastair. ‚ÄúExplaining Ptolemy's Roman Britain.‚Äù Britannia, vol. 28, 1997, pp. 1‚Äì30.

The lowest of these is the gauge at Parkhill near Dyce, with a mean flow of . The station measures 97% of the total catchment of the river. Prior to 2016 the maximum levels and flows were recorded during the floods of November 2002, with peak levels on the 22nd of that month reaching at Haughton near Inverurie, and at Parkhill. These were exceeded in January 2016 during the 2015‚Äì16 floods, when levels at Haughton reached , whilst those at Parkhill were over a metre higher than previously at . The resultant flooding forced residents along the river to evacuate their homes, in some cases with the help of local rescue teams.

It is one of the tributaries of the River Mersey. Etymology The name Goyt may be derived from the Middle English gote, meaning \\"a watercourse, a stream\\". Derivation from the Welsh gwyth meaning \\"vein\\" has been suggested, but described as \\"doubtful\\". Course The Goyt rises on the moors of Axe Edge, near the River Dane and the Cat and Fiddle Inn. The area is known as the Upper Goyt Valley. The old Cat and Fiddle Road from Buxton to Macclesfield crosses the river just as it turns northwards to flow down its well-known valley. The river then flows under Derbyshire Bridge, which was the old boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire. Later it reaches an old packhorse bridge that was moved when Errwood reservoir was built in the 1960s (see photo below). Further downstream there is another reservoir, the Fernilee Reservoir, built in 1938. The original line of the Cromford and High Peak Railway can be seen near this point. The Goyt then passes through Taxal and Horwich End where it is joined by the Todd Brook. Thereafter it passes through Whaley Bridge, New Mills (where it is joined by the River Sett) and Marple Bridge. Having been joined by the River Etherow, the Goyt joins the River Tame at Stockport, forming the River Mersey. The section of the Goyt valley between Etherow Country Park and Whaley Bridge is followed by the Goyt Way, a walking route and part of the longer Midshires Way. The River Goyt is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a girl whose Royalist lover drowned in the river.  Pollution  The river's Environment Agency pollution classification changed from moderate to poor in its lower section from the Etherow to the Mersey in 2016, and in 2015 for the New Mills to Whaley Bridge length. Otherwise the quality is moderate.

American doctor Henry Heimlich is often credited for its discovery. Performing abdominal thrusts involves a rescuer standing behind a patient and using his or her hands to exert pressure on the bottom of the diaphragm. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. Most modern protocols, including those of the American Heart Association, American Red Cross and the European Resuscitation Council, recommend several stages for airway obstructions, designed to apply increasingly more pressure. Most protocols recommend encouraging the victim to cough, followed by hard back slaps, and finally abdominal thrusts or chest thrusts as a last resort. Some guidelines also recommend alternating between abdominal thrusts and back slaps.Foreign object inhaled: First aid, Mayo Clinic staff, November 1, 2011.  History  Henry Heimlich, noted for promulgating abdominal thrusts, claimed that back slaps were proven to cause death by lodging foreign objects into the windpipe. The 1982 Yale study by Day, DuBois, and Crelin that persuaded the American Heart Association to stop recommending back blows for dealing with choking was partially funded by Heimlich's own foundation. According to Roger White MD of the Mayo Clinic and American Heart Association (AHA), \\"There was never any science here. Heimlich overpowered science all along the way with his slick tactics and intimidation, and everyone, including us at the AHA, caved in.\\" From 1985 to 2005, abdominal thrusts were the only recommended treatment for choking in the published guidelines of the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross. In 2006, both organizations drastically changed course and \\"downgraded\\" the use of the technique. For conscious victims, the new guidelines recommend first applying back slaps; if this method failed to remove the airway obstruction, rescuers were to then apply abdominal thrusts. For unconscious victims, the new guidelines recommend chest thrusts. Henry Heimlich also promoted abdominal thrusts as a treatment for drowning and asthma attacks. The Red Cross now contests those claims. The Heimlich Institute has stopped advocating on their website for the Heimlich maneuver to be used as a first aid measure for drowning victims. His son, Peter M. Heimlich, alleges that in August 1974 his father published the first of a series of fraudulent case reports in order to promote the use of abdominal thrusts for near-drowning rescue.Heimlich's son cites Dallas case in dispute. Wilkes-Barre News, August 22, 2007 The 2005 drowning rescue guidelines of the American Heart Association did not include citations of Heimlich's work, and warned against the use of the Heimlich maneuver for drowning rescue as unproven and dangerous, due to its risk of vomiting leading to aspiration. In May 2016 Henry Heimlich, age 96, personally used the maneuver to save the life of a fellow resident at his retirement home in Cincinnati. According to the article, it was either the first or second time Heimlich himself used his namesake maneuver to save the life of someone in a non-simulated choking situation. Universal sign of choking A choking victim is usually unable to speak, and may not be able to make much sound at all. A universal sign of choking has been designated as a silent indication from a person who is unable to breathe, and consists of placing both hands on one's own throat while trying to attract the attention of others who might assist.  Technique  alt= Both the American Red Cross and UK National Health Service (NHS) advise that, as a first resort, a rescuer should encourage the patient to cough out the obstruction. As a second resort, the rescuer should give five slaps on the back, after bending the patient forward. Abdominal thrusts are recommended only if these methods fail. As with the European Resuscitation Council and the Mayo Clinic, they recommend a repeating cycle of 5 back slaps and 5 abdominal thrusts. They are not recommended on babies below the age of 1. In contrast to the prevailing American and European advice, the Australian Resuscitation Council recommends chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts. Performing abdominal thrusts involves a rescuer standing behind an upright patient, and using his or her hands to exert forceful pressures on the bottom of the diaphragm. As an example, WebMD recommends to make a fist with one hand grasping it with the other, to press with both just above the person's bellybutton. This compresses the lungs and exerts pressure on any object lodged in the trachea, hopefully expelling it. The pressure amounts to an artificially induced cough. To assist a larger person, more force may be needed.Heimlich Maneuver for Adults and Children Older Than 1 Year ‚Äì Topic Overview, WebMD, April 28, 2010. The Mayo Clinic recommends the same placement of fist and hand and upward thrusts as if you are trying to lift the person. If the victim can not receive pressures on the abdomen (for example, in case of pregnancy or excessive obesity), chest thrust are advised instead. These are applied on the lower half of the chest bone, but not in the very endpoint (which is the xiphoid process and could be broken). If the victim is not upright, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommends positioning the person on his or her back, then straddling the torso and using chest thrusts. It is possible for still-conscious choking victims to perform the procedure on themselves, without assistance. However, this can be difficult, so, in this cases and some others (disabled people, etc.), it's recommended the use of an anti-choking device. Due to the forceful nature of the procedure, even when done correctly, abdominal thrusts can injure the person on whom it is performed. Bruising to the abdomen is highly likely and more serious injuries can occur, including fracture of the xiphoid process or ribs. The NHS recommend that anyone who has been subjected to abdominal thrusts should seek a medical examination afterwards. Researchers at Royal Brompton Hospital have demonstrated that similar intrathoracic pressures (50‚Äì60 cmH2O) are produced by a first aider performing abdominal thrusts inwards as are produced when the force is directed inwards and upwards. They argue that this may be easier to perform with less concern about injury to ribcage or upper abdominal organs. Self-administered abdominal thrusts by study participants produced similar pressures to those generated by first aiders. The highest pressures were produced by participants performing an abdominal thrust onto the back of a chair (115 cmH2O).

First released on desktop in 2003 with Mac OS X Panther, a mobile version has been bundled with iOS devices since the iPhone's introduction in 2007. Safari is the default browser on Apple devices. A Windows version was available from 2007 to 2012.  History and development  Until 1997, Apple's Macintosh computers shipped with the Netscape Navigator and Cyberdog web browsers only. Internet Explorer for Mac was later included as the default web browser for Mac OS 8.1 and later, as part of a five-year agreement between Apple and Microsoft. During that time, Microsoft released three major versions of Internet Explorer for Mac that were bundled with Mac OS 8 and Mac OS 9, though Apple continued to include Netscape Navigator as an alternative. Microsoft ultimately released a Mac OS X edition of Internet Explorer for Mac, which was included as the default browser in all Mac OS X releases from Mac OS X DP4 up to and including Mac OS X v10.2. = Safari 1 = On January 7, 2003, at Macworld San Francisco, Steve Jobs announced that Apple had developed its own web browser, called Safari. It was based on Apple's internal fork of the KHTML rendering engine, called WebKit. The company released the first beta version, available only for Mac OS X, later that day. A number of official and unofficial beta versions followed, up until version 1.0 was released on June 23, 2003. Initially only available as a separate download for Mac OS X 10.2, Safari was bundled with Mac OS X v10.3 on October 24, 2003, as the default browser, with Internet Explorer for Mac included only as an alternative browser. Version 1.0.3, released on August 13, 2004, was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.2, while 1.3.2, released on January 12, 2006, was the last version to support Mac OS X 10.3. However, 10.3 received security updates through 2007. = Safari 2 = In April 2005, Dave Hyatt, one of the Safari developers at Apple, documented his study by fixing specific bugs in Safari, thereby enabling it to pass the Acid2 test developed by the Web Standards Project. On April 27, 2005, he announced that his development version of Safari now passed the test, making it the first web browser to do so. Safari 2.0 was released on April 29, 2005, as the only web browser included with Mac OS X 10.4. This version was touted by Apple as possessing a 1.8x speed boost over version 1.2.4, but did not yet include the Acid2 bug fixes. The necessary changes were initially unavailable to end-users unless they downloaded and compiled the WebKit source code themselves or ran one of the nightly automated builds available at OpenDarwin.org. Apple eventually released version 2.0.2 of Safari, which included the modifications required to pass Acid2, on October 31, 2005. In June 2005, after some criticism from KHTML developers over lack of access to change logs, Apple moved the development source code and bug tracking of WebCore and JavaScriptCore to OpenDarwin.org. WebKit itself was also released as open source. The source code for non-renderer aspects of the browser, such as its GUI elements, remains proprietary. The final stable version of Safari 2, Safari 2.0.4, was released on January 10, 2006, for Mac OS X. It was only available as part of Mac OS X Update 10.4.4. This version addressed layout and CPU usage issues, among other improvements. Safari 2.0.4 was the last version to be released exclusively on Mac OS X. = Safari 3 = On January 9, 2007, at Macworld SF, Jobs announced the iPhone. The device's operating system (later called iPhone OS and subsequently renamed to iOS) used a mobile version of the Safari browser and was able to display full, desktop- class websites. On June 11, 2007, at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference, Jobs announced Safari 3 for Mac OS X 10.5, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. During the announcement, he ran a benchmark based on the iBench browser test suite comparing the most popular Windows browsers, hence claiming that Safari was the fastest browser. Later third-party tests of HTTP load times would support Apple's claim that Safari 3 was indeed the fastest browser on the Windows platform in terms of initial data loading over the Internet, though it was found to be only negligibly faster than Internet Explorer 7 and Mozilla Firefox when loading static content from local cache. The initial Safari 3 beta version for Windows, released on the same day as its announcement at WWDC 2007, had several known bugs and a zero day exploit that allowed remote execution. The addressed bugs were then corrected by Apple three days later on June 14, 2007, in version 3.0.1 for Windows. On June 22, 2007, Apple released Safari 3.0.2 to address some bugs, performance issues and other security issues. Safari 3.0.2 for Windows handles some fonts that are missing in the browser but already installed on Windows computers, such as Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, and others. The iPhone was formally released on June 29, 2007. It included a version of Safari based on the same WebKit rendering engine as the desktop version, but with a modified feature set better suited for a mobile device. The version number of Safari as reported in its user agent string is 3.0, in line with the contemporary desktop versions of Safari. The first stable, non-beta release of Safari for Windows, Safari 3.1, was offered as a free download on March 18, 2008. In June 2008, Apple released version 3.1.2, addressing a security vulnerability in the Windows version where visiting a malicious web site could force a download of executable files and execute them on the user's desktop. Safari 3.2, released on November 13, 2008, introduced anti-phishing features using Google Safe Browsing and Extended Validation Certificate support. The final version of Safari 3 is 3.2.3, released on May 12, 2009. = Safari 4 = On June 2, 2008, the WebKit development team announced SquirrelFish, a new JavaScript engine that vastly improves Safari's speed at interpreting scripts. The engine is one of the new features in Safari 4, released to developers on June 11, 2008. The new JavaScript engine quickly evolved into SquirrelFish Extreme, featuring even further improved performance over SquirrelFish, and was eventually marketed as Nitro. A public beta of Safari 4 was released on February 24, 2009, with new features such as the Top Sites tool (similar to Opera's Speed Dial feature), which displays the user's most visited sites on a 3D wall. Cover Flow, a feature of Mac OS X and iTunes, was also implemented in Safari. In the public beta versions, tabs were placed in the title bar of the window, similar to Google Chrome. The tab bar was moved back to its original location, below the URL bar, in the final release. The Windows version adopted a native Windows theme, rather than the previously employed Mac OS X-style interface. Also, Apple removed the blue progress bar located in the address bar (later reinstated in Safari 5). Safari 4.0.1 was released for Mac on June 17, 2009, and fixed problems with Faces in iPhoto '09. Safari 4 in Mac OS X v10.6 \\"Snow Leopard\\" has 64-bit support, which can make JavaScript loading up to 50% faster. It also has built-in crash resistance unique to Snow Leopard; crash resistance will keep the browser intact if a plug-in like Flash player crashes, such that the other tabs or windows will be unaffected. Safari 4.0.4, released on November 11, 2009, for both OS X and Windows, further improves JavaScript performance. Safari was one of the twelve browsers offered to EU users of Microsoft Windows in 2010. It was one of the five browsers displayed on the first page of browser choices along with Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Opera.  Safari 4 features  Beginning with Safari 4, the address bar has been completely revamped: * The blue inline progress bar is replaced with a spinning bezel and a loading indicator attached to it. * The button to add a bookmark is now attached to the address bar by default. * The reload/stop button is now superimposed on the right end of the address bar. Safari on Mac OS X and Windows was made to look more similar to Safari on iPhone than previous versions. Safari 4 also includes the following new features: * Completely passes the Acid3 standards test * Cover Flow browsing for History and Bookmarks * Improved developer tools, including Web Inspector, CSS element viewing, JavaScript debugger and profiler, offline table and database management with SQL support, and resource graphs * Nitro JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript up to eight times faster than Internet Explorer 8 and more than four times faster than Firefox 3 * Native Windows look on Windows (Aero, Luna, Classic, etc., depending on OS and settings) with standard Windows font rendering and optional Apple font rendering * Support for CSS image retouching effects * Support for CSS Canvas * Speculative loading, where Safari loads the documents, scripts, and style information that are required to view a web page ahead of time * Support for HTML5 * Top Sites, which displays up to 24 thumbnails of a user's most frequently visited pages on startup = Safari 5 = Apple released Safari 5 on June 7, 2010, featuring the new Safari Reader for reading articles on the web without distraction (based on Arc90's Readability tool), and a 30 percent JavaScript performance increase over Safari 4. Safari 5 includes improved developer tools and supports more than a dozen new HTML5 technologies, focused on interoperability. Since Safari 5, developers can create secure Safari Extensions to customize and enhance the browsing experience. Apple also re- added the progress bar behind the address bar in this release. Safari 5.0.1 enabled the Extensions PrefPane by default; previously, users had to enable it via the Debug menu. Apple also released Safari 4.1 concurrently with Safari 5, exclusively for Mac OS X Tiger. The update included the majority of the features and security enhancements found in Safari 5. It did not, however, include Safari Reader or Safari Extensions. Together with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple released Safari 5.1 for both Windows and Mac on July 20, 2011, with the new function 'Reading List' and a faster browsing experience. Apple simultaneously released Safari 5.0.6 for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, excluding Leopard users from the new functions in Safari 5.1. Safari 5.1.7 has become the last version of Safari developed for Windows.  Safari 5 features  Safari 5 includes the following new features: * Full-text search through the browser history * Safari Reader, which removes formatting and ads from webpages. * Smarter address field, where the address bar autocomplete will match against titles of web page in history or bookmarks. * Extensions, which are add-ons that customize the web browsing experience. * Improved support for HTML5, including full screen video, closed caption, geolocation, EventSource, and a now obsolete early variant of the WebSocket protocol. * Improved Web Inspector. * Faster Nitro JavaScript Engine. * DNS prefetching, where Safari finds links and looks up addresses on the web page ahead of time. * Bing search. * Improved graphics hardware acceleration on Windows. Additionally, the blue inline progress bar has returned to the address bar, in addition to the spinning bezel and loading indicator introduced in Safari 4. Top Sites view now has a button to switch to Full History Search. Other features include Extension builder for developers of Safari Extensions, which are built using web standards such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. = Safari 6 = Safari 6.0 was previously known as Safari 5.2 until Apple announced the change at WWDC 2012. The stable release of Safari 6 coincided with the release of OS X Mountain Lion on July 25, 2012, and is integrated into the OS. As Apple integrated it with Mountain Lion, it is no longer available for download from the Apple website or other sources. Apple released Safari 6 via Software Update for users of OS X Lion. It has not been released for OS X versions prior to Lion or for Windows. Regarding the unavailability of Safari 6 on Windows, Apple has stated \\"Safari 6 is available for Mountain Lion and Lion. Safari 5 continues to be available for Windows.\\" Microsoft removed Safari from its BrowserChoice page. On June 11, 2012, Apple released a developer preview of Safari 6.0 with a feature called iCloud Tabs, which allows users to 'sync' their open tabs with any iOS or other OS X device running the latest software. Safari 6 also included new privacy features, including an \\"Ask websites not to track me\\" preference, and the ability for websites to send OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion users notifications, although it removed RSS support. Safari 6 has the Share Sheets capability in OS X Mountain Lion. The Share Sheet options are: Add to Reading List, Add Bookmark, Email this Page, Message, Twitter and Facebook. Tabs with full-page previews were added, too.  Safari 6 features  Safari 6 introduced the following features, many of which are only available on OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion: * Unified smart search field, which combines the web address and search fields, similar to Chrome's Omnibox and Firefox's Awesome Bar. * Tab view (Mountain Lion only), which enables movement between tabs using multi-touch gestures. * iCloud tabs (Mountain Lion only) synchronizes recent websites across OS X and iOS devices. * Built-in sharing (Mountain Lion only) to email, Messages, Twitter and Facebook. * Improved performance * Support for -webkit-calc() Additionally various features were removed, including, but not limited to, Activity Window, separate Download Window, direct support for RSS feeds in the URL field and bookmarks. The separate search field is also no longer available as a toolbar configuration option. = Safari 7 = Announced at Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013, the Safari 7/6.1 developer preview brought improvements in JavaScript performance and memory usage, as well as a new look for Top Sites and the Sidebar, and a new Shared Links feature. Additionally, a new Power Saver feature pauses Plugins which are not in use. Safari 7 for OS X Mavericks and Safari 6.1 (for Lion and Mountain Lion) were released along with OS X Mavericks in an Apple special event on October 22, 2013. = Safari 8 = Safari 8 was announced at WWDC 2014 and released with OS X Yosemite.

The first version of Safari 10 was released on September 20, 2016, and the last version (10.1.2) was released on July 19, 2017. = Safari 11 = Safari 11 was released as a part of macOS High Sierra but was also made available for OS X El Capitan and macOS Sierra on September 19, 2017. Safari 11 included several new features such as Intelligent Tracking Prevention which aims to prevent cross-site tracking by placing limitations on cookies and other website data. = Safari 12 = Safari 12 was released in the lead up to macOS Mojave but was also made available for macOS Sierra and macOS High Sierra on September 17, 2018. Safari 12 includes several new features such as Icons in tabs, Automatic Strong Passwords, and Intelligent Tracking Prevention 2.0. An updated Safari version 12.0.1 was released on October 30, 2018, as part of macOS Mojave 10.14.1 release, and Safari 12.0.2 was released on December 5, 2018, alongside macOS 10.14.2. Support for developer-signed classic Safari Extensions has been dropped. This version will also be the last one that supports the official Extensions Gallery, and Apple encourages extension authors to switch to Safari App Extensions. This move triggered negative feedback in the community. = Safari 13 = Safari 13 was announced alongside macOS Catalina at WWDC 2019 on June 3, 2019. Safari 13 includes several new features such as prompting users to change weak passwords, FIDO2 USB security key authentication support, Sign in with Apple support, Apple Pay on the Web support, and increased speed and security. Safari 13 was released on September 20, 2019, on macOS Mojave and macOS High Sierra. =Safari 14= In June 2020 it was announced that macOS Big Sur will include Safari 14. Safari 14 introduces new privacy features, including Privacy Report, which shows blocked content and privacy information on web pages. Users will also receive a monthly report on trackers that Safari has blocked. Extensions can also be enabled or disabled on a site-by-site basis. Safari 14 introduced support for the WebExtension API used in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, and Opera, making it easier for developers to port their extensions from those web browsers to Safari. Support for Adobe Flash Player will also be dropped from Safari. Safari 14 was released as a standalone update to macOS Catalina and Mojave users on September 16, 2020. = Safari Technology Preview = Safari Technology Preview was first released alongside OS X El Capitan 10.11.4. Safari Technology Preview releases include the latest version of WebKit, incorporating Web technologies to be incorporated in future stable releases of Safari, so that developers and users can install the Technology Preview release on a Mac, test those features, and provide feedback.  Other features  Safari's Web Inspector in macOS Mojave. On macOS, Safari is a Cocoa application. It uses Apple's WebKit for rendering web pages and running JavaScript. WebKit consists of WebCore (based on Konqueror's KHTML engine) and JavaScriptCore (originally based on KDE's JavaScript engine, named KJS). Like KHTML and KJS, WebCore and JavaScriptCore are free software and are released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. Some Apple improvements to the KHTML code are merged back into the Konqueror project. Apple also releases additional code under an open source 2-clause BSD-like license. Until Safari 6.0, it included a built-in web feed aggregator that supported the RSS and Atom standards. Current features include Private Browsing (a mode in which no record of information about the user's web activity is retained by the browser), the ability to archive web content in WebArchive format, the ability to email complete web pages directly from a browser menu, the ability to search bookmarks, and the ability to share tabs between all Mac and iOS devices running appropriate versions of software via an iCloud account. = iOS-specific features = Safari on the iPhone and iPod Touch running iOS 12 in Landscape view Safari on an iPad running iOS 12 in Landscape view iOS-specific features for Safari enable: * Bookmarking links to particular pages as \\"Web Clip\\" icons on the Home screen. * MDI-style browsing. * Opening specially designed pages in full-screen mode. * Pressing on an image for 3 seconds to save it to the photo album. * Support for HTML5 new input types.

This feature was expanded to home-screen web applications in iOS 5.0.  New in iOS 5  * True tabbed browsing, similar to the desktop experience, only for iPads. * Reading List, a bookmarking feature that allows tagging of certain sites for reading later, which syncs across all Safari browsers (mobile and desktop) via Apple's iCloud service. * Reader, a reading feature that can format text and images from a web page into a more readable format, similar to a PDF document, while stripping out web advertising and superfluous information. * Private browsing, like in most desktop browsers a feature that does not save the user's cookies and history, or allow anything to be written into local storage or webSql databases.  New in iOS 6  * iCloud Tabs, linking the desktop and iOS versions of Safari. * Offline Reading Lists allow users to read pages stored previously without remaining connected to the internet. * Full-screen landscape view for iPhone and iPod touch users hides most of the Safari controls except back and forward buttons and the status bar when in landscape mode.  New in iOS 7  * New icon * 64-bit build on supported devices using the A7 processor. * iCloud Keychain: iCloud can remember passwords, account names and credit card numbers. Safari can also autofill them as well. Requires devices that run iOS 7.0.3 and later and OS X Mavericks or later. * Password Generator: When creating a new account, Safari can suggest the user a long, more secure, hard to guess password and Safari will also automatically remember the password. * Shared Links * Do Not Track * Parental controls * Tab limit increased from 9 to 36 * New Tab view (iPhone and iPod touch only) * Unified smart search field * Sync Bookmarks with Google Chrome and Firefox on Windows.

Apple announced WebKit2 in April 2010. Safari for OS X switched to the new API with version 5.1. Safari for iOS switched to WebKit2 with iOS 8.  Security = Plugins = Apple maintains a plugin blacklist that it can remotely update to prevent potentially dangerous or vulnerable plug-ins from running on Safari. Initially, Apple had blocked versions of Flash and Java in earlier versions of Safari. Since Safari 12 support for NPAPI plugins (except for Flash) have been completely dropped. Starting with the release of Safari 14, support for Adobe Flash Player will be dropped altogether. = License = The license has common terms against reverse engineering, copying and sub-licensing, except parts that are open source, and it disclaims warranties and liability. Apple tracks use of the browser. Windows users may not opt out of tracking since their license omits the opening If clause. Other users may opt out, and all users can opt out of location tracking by not using location services. \\"If you choose to allow diagnostic and usage collection, you agree that Apple and its subsidiaries and agents may collect... usage and related information... to provide ... services to you (if any) related to the Apple Software... in a form that does not personally identify you... Apple may also provide any such partner or third party developer with a subset of diagnostic information that is relevant to that partner‚Äôs or developer‚Äôs software... Apple and its partners, licensees, third party developers and website may transmit, collect, maintain, process and use your location data... and location search queries... in a form that does not personally identify you ... You may withdraw this consent at any time...\\" Apple thinks \\"personal\\" does not cover \\"unique device identifiers\\" such as serial number, cookie number, or IP address, so they use these where allowed by law. \\"We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect ... unique device identifier... We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non‚Äëpersonal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.\\" In September 2017 Apple announced that it will use artificial intelligence (AI) to reduce the ability of advertisers to track Safari users as they browse the web. Cookies used for tracking will be allowed for 24 hours, then disabled, unless AI judges the user wants the cookie. Major advertising groups objected, saying it will reduce the free services supported by advertising, while other experts praised the change. = Browser exploits = An overview and detailed information about Safari exploits are listed by CVE Details. In the PWN2OWN contest at the 2008 CanSecWest security conference in Vancouver, British Columbia, an exploit of Safari caused Mac OS X to be the first OS to fall in a hacking competition. Participants competed to find a way to read the contents of a file located on the user's desktop in one of three operating systems: Mac OS X Leopard, Windows Vista SP1, and Ubuntu 7.10. On the second day of the contest, when users were allowed to physically interact with the computers (the prior day permitted only network attacks), Charlie Miller compromised Mac OS X through an unpatched vulnerability of the PCRE library used by Safari. Miller was aware of the flaw before the conference and worked to exploit it unannounced, as is the common approach in these contests. The exploited vulnerability and other flaws were patched in Safari 3.1.1. In the 2009 PWN2OWN contest, Charlie Miller performed another exploit of Safari to hack into a Mac. Miller again acknowledged that he knew about the security flaw before the competition and had done considerable research and preparation work on the exploit. Apple released a patch for this exploit and others on May 12, 2009 with Safari 3.2.3.  System requirements  Safari 6.0 requires a Mac running Mac OS X v10.7.4 or later. Safari 5.1.7 requires a Mac running Mac OS X v10.6.8 or any PC running Windows XP Service Pack 2 or later, Windows Vista, or Windows 7. Safari 5.0.6 requires a Mac running on Mac OS X 10.5.8. = 64-bit builds = The version of Safari included in Mac OS X v10.6 (and later versions) is compiled for 64-bit architecture. Apple claims that running Safari in 64-bit mode will increase rendering speeds by up to 50%. On 64-bit devices, iOS and its stock apps are 64-bit builds including Safari.  Criticism = Distribution through Apple Software Update = An earlier version of Apple Software Update (bundled with Safari, QuickTime, and iTunes for Microsoft Windows) selected Safari for installation from a list of Apple programs to download by default, even when an existing installation of Safari was not detected on a user's machine. John Lilly, former CEO of Mozilla, stated that Apple's use of its updating software to promote its other products was \\"a bad practice and should stop.\\" He argued that the practice \\"borders on malware distribution practices\\" and \\"undermines the trust that we're all trying to build with users.\\" Apple spokesman Bill Evans sidestepped Lilly's statement, saying that Apple was only \\"using Software Update to make it easy and convenient for both Mac and Windows users to get the latest Safari update from Apple.\\" Apple also released a new version of Apple Software Update that puts new software in its own section, though still selected for installation by default. By late 2008, Apple Software Update no longer selected new installation items in the new software section by default. = Security updates for Snow Leopard and Windows platforms = Software security firm Sophos detailed how Snow Leopard and Windows users were not supported by the Safari 6 release at the time, while there were over 121 vulnerabilities left unpatched on those platforms. Since then, Snow Leopard has had only three minor version releases (the most recent in September 2013), and Windows has had none. While no official word has been released by Apple, the indication is that these are the final versions available for these operating systems, and both retain significant security issues. = Failure to adopt modern standards = While Safari pioneered several now standard HTML5 features (such as the Canvas API) in its early years, it has come under attack< for failing to keep pace with some modern web technologies. Since 2015, iOS has allowed third party web browsers to be installed, including Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge; however, they are all forced to use the underlying WebKit browser engine, and inherit its limitations. = Intentionally limiting ad blockers and tracking protection = Beginning in 2018, Apple made technical changes to Safari's content blocking functionality which prompted backlash from users and developers of ad blocking extensions, who said the changes made it impossible to offer a similar level of user protection found in other browsers. Internally, the update limited the number of blocking rules which could be applied by third-party extensions, preventing the full implementation of community-developed blocklists. In response, several developers of popular ad and tracking blockers announced their products were being discontinued, as they were now incompatible with Safari's newly-limited content blocking features. As a matter of policy, Apple requires the use of WebKit, Safari's underlying rendering engine, in all browsers developed for its iOS platform, preventing users from installing any competing product which offers full ad blocking functionality. Beginning with Safari 13, popular extensions such as UBlock Origin will no longer work. Safari Developer Program The Safari Developer Program was a free program for writers of extensions and HTML5 websites. It allowed members to develop extensions for Apple's Safari web browser. Since WWDC 2015 it is part of the unified Apple Developer Program, which costs $99 a year.

Overview While ROTC graduate officers serve in all branches of the U.S. military, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Coast Guard do not have their own respective ROTC programs, but graduates of Naval ROTC programs have the option to serve as officers in the Marine Corps contingent on meeting Marine Corps requirements. The Coast Guard has no ROTC program and its officers can only be commissioned via the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Coast Guard Officer Candidate School, interservice transfer from another U.S. military service following completion of at least 4 years commissioned service in that other branch of the U.S. military (e.g. such as interservice transfers for officers designated as Army Aviators, USN and USMC Naval Aviators and USAF Pilots), or via the Coast Guard College Student Pre-Commissioning Initiative (CSPI), although the CSPI program is only available at colleges and universities designated as a Minority Serving Institute (MSI) or with a student population of at least 50% minorities for the past three years. In 2017, ROTC graduates constituted 58.5 percent of newly commissioned active- duty U.S. Army officers, 3.0 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Marine Corps officers (through NROTC), 21.4 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Navy officers and 31.1 percent of newly commissioned U.S. Air Force officers, for a combined 36.9 percent of all active-duty officers in the Department of Defense commissioned that year. Under ROTC, a student may receive a competitive, merit-based scholarship covering all or part of college tuition, textbooks and lab fees, in return for an active-duty service obligation after graduation (or completion of a graduate degree under an approved education delay). ROTC students attend college like other students, but also receive basic military training and officer training for their chosen branch of service through the ROTC unit at or nearby the college. The students participate in regular drills during the school year and off-campus training opportunities during the summer. Army ROTC units are organized as brigades, battalions and companies. Air Force ROTC units are detachments with the students organized into wings, groups, squadrons and flights. Army and Air Force ROTC students are referred to as cadets. Naval ROTC units are organized as battalions and also include NROTC students under \\"Marine Option\\" who will eventually be commissioned as officers in the Marine Corps. Marine NROTC students may be formed in a separate company when the program includes sufficient numbers. All Naval ROTC students are referred to as midshipmen. Some of the summer training that is offered to cadets in the Army ROTC program are: Airborne, Air Assault, Mountain Warfare, WHINSEC and other related schools. In addition to their mandatory pre-commissioning Field Training (FT) at Maxwell AFB, Alabama (4 weeks for 4-year program cadets; 6 weeks for 2-year program cadets), Air Force ROTC cadets are also eligible for Airborne training under the tutelage of the Army at Fort Benning, Georgia. Naval ROTC midshipmen will participate in summer cruise programs every summer, either afloat or ashore, similar to their U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen counterparts. History ROTC at the University of Florida during the 1920s The concept of ROTC in the United States was created by Alden Partridge and began with the Morrill Act of 1862 which established the land-grant colleges. Part of the federal government's requirement for these schools was that they include military tactics as part of their curriculum, forming what became known as ROTC. The college from which ROTC originated is Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont. Norwich was founded in 1819 at Norwich, Vermont as the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy. The university was founded by former West Point instructor Captain Alden Partridge, who promoted the idea of a \\"citizen soldier\\"‚Äîa man trained to act in a military capacity when his nation required, but capable of fulfilling standard civilian functions in peacetime. This idea eventually led to the formation of Reservist and National Guard units with regimented training in place of local militia forces. Another root of the modern ROTC program comes from the \\"Plattsburg Idea\\". In 1915, Major General Leonard Wood instituted the Citizen's Military Training Corps, the first series of training camps to make officers out of civilians. For the first time in history, an attempt was made to provide a condensed course of training and commissioning competent reserve line officers after only a summer of military training. Over 5,000 men arrived at Plattsburgh in May 1917 for the first of the large training corps. By the end of 1917, over 17,000 men had been trained. By the eve of its entry into World War One, the U.S. had a prepared corps of officers including one of the earliest Plattsburgh graduates, Theodore Roosevelt Jr. During the 1930s, there were ROTC programs in some larger city high schools (Memphis, TN; Charlotte, NC; Kansas City, MO; New Orleans, LA).An Interview with John HindeBrooklyn Oral History Oscar K. Chamber, the first African American ROTC graduate at Arlington State College, 1965 Until the 1960s, many major universities required compulsory ROTC for all of their male students. However, because of the protests that culminated in the opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, compulsory ROTC was dropped in favor of voluntary programs. In some places ROTC was expelled from campus altogether, although it was always possible to participate in off-campus ROTC. Currently, more than 1,700 high schools have Junior Reserve Officers‚Äô Training Corps (JROTC) programs.Army Junior ROTC Program Overview In the 21st century, the debate often focused around the Congressional don't ask, don't tell law, signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and in force until 2011, which forbade homosexuals serving in the United States military from disclosing their sexual orientation at the risk of expulsion. Some schools believed this legal mandate would require them to waive or amend their non- discrimination policies. In recent years, concerted efforts are being made at some Ivy League universities that have previously banned ROTC (including Columbia) to return ROTC to campus. The Harvard ROTC program was reinstated effective March 4, 2011 following enactment of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010. Under current law, there are three types of ROTC programs administered, each with a different element. An Army ROTC unit practicing rapelling from a parking garage in September 2010 * The first are the programs at the six senior military colleges, also known as military schools. These institutions grant baccalaureate degrees (at a minimum) and organize all or some of their students into a corps of cadets under some sort of military discipline. Those participating in the cadet program must attend at least 2 years of ROTC education. * The second are programs at \\"civilian colleges\\". As defined under Army regulations, these are schools that grant baccalaureate or graduate degrees and are not operated on a military basis. *The third category is programs at military junior colleges (MJC). These are military schools that provide junior college education (typically A.S. or A.A. degree). These schools do not grant baccalaureate degrees but they meet all other requirements of military colleges (if participating in the Early Commissioning Program) and cadets are required to meet the same military standards as other schools (if enrolled in ECP), as set by Army Cadet Command. Cadets can be commissioned as second lieutenants in the Army Reserve/Army National Guard as graduating sophomores. Upon commissioning, these lieutenants are required to complete their bachelor's degree at another institution (of the lieutenant's choosing) while serving in their units. Upon receiving their bachelors, ECP lieutenants can assess active duty and go onto active duty as a first lieutenant. Only the Army currently offers an Early Commissioning Program. In time of war, MJC's have played a significant role in producing officers for the Army. During the Vietnam war, the requirement to complete one's bachelor's degree was not in effect. Therefore, upon commissioning lieutenants went straight onto active duty. One difference between civilian colleges and the senior or junior military colleges is enrollment option in ROTC. ROTC is voluntary for students attending civilian colleges and universities. However, with few exceptions (as outlined in both Army regulations and federal law) it is required of students attending the senior and junior military colleges. Another major difference between the senior military colleges and civilian colleges is that under federal law, graduates of the SMCs are guaranteed active duty assignments if requested with the approval of the school's professor of military science. U.S. Army ROTC Army ROTC cadets on a field training exercise in March 2005 Arlington State College ROTC students firing a mortar during a field exercise, circa 1950s The Army Reserve Officer Training Corps (AROTC) program is the largest branch of ROTC, as the Army is the largest branch of the military. There are over 20,000 ROTC cadets in 273 ROTC programs at major universities throughout the United States. These schools are categorized as Military Colleges (MC), Military Junior Colleges (MJC) and Civilian Colleges (CC). Army ROTC provides the majority of the Army's officer corps; the remainder comes from West Point, Officer Candidate School (OCS), or direct commissions. AROTC offers scholarships based on the time of enrollment in the program. Newly graduated seniors in high school can enter the program with a full four-year scholarship while college students can enroll later and earn a scholarship that would cover the remainder of their college career. The two-year scholarship is available for students with two academic years of college remaining. An applicant for a two-year or four-year scholarship must meet the following requirements: * U.S. citizen * High school diploma or equivalent * Between ages 17 and 27 * College GPA of at least 2.5 * Army physical fitness standard The applicant must agree to accept a commission and serve in the Army on Active Duty or in a Reserve Component (U.S. Army Reserve or Army National Guard). The four-year scholarship is for students who receive it out of high school or before entering college. The four-year scholarship can be extended with the same conditions to a 5-year scholarship if the major is in Engineering. The two-and-a-half-year scholarship is available for students already enrolled in a college or university with three academic years remaining. An applicant for a two-and-a-half-year scholarship must meet the requirements for a two-year scholarship and also have a minimum SAT score of 920 or ACT score of 19. Once an applicant has shown interest in the AROTC program the cadre can select him for a scholarship if he/she excels in the three major pillars: # Grades- 2.5 GPA or better # PT- score of 60 in each category (push-ups, sit-ups, and a two-mile run) # Participation- extracurricular activities in the program, community, or school Prior to 2015, a cadet had to have passed LDAC between their summer of becoming a senior. LDAC (Leadership Developmental and Assessment Course) was held at Fort Lewis, Washington until its final year at Fort Knox, Kentucky, where each cadet would be evaluated on leadership skills. The course was set up for a month of training with other peers and evaluated by prior servicemen. From 2015, cadets attend Advanced Camp between their junior and senior year at Fort Knox, Kentucky. For 2015 and 2016, the training was not evaluated and simply pass/no pass beginning in 2017 Advanced Camp will become evaluated again. Cadet Summer Training (CST), including Advanced Camp and basic camp, is the U.S. Army's largest training event. U.S. Navy ROTC The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) program was founded in 1926 and the U.S. Marine Corps joined the program in 1932. The naval NROTC program is offered at over 150 colleges nationwide. The Nation's first Marine Corps oriented NROTC was established at The Citadel in 1970. U.S. Air Force ROTC The first Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (then Air ROTC) units were established between 1920 and 1923 at the University of California, Berkeley, the Georgia Institute of Technology, the University of Illinois, the University of Washington, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Texas A&M; University. After World War II, the Air Force established ROTC units at 77 colleges and universities throughout the United States. Controversy The Solomon Amendment denies federal funding to any university with a \\"policy or practice\\" that prevents the military from \\"maintaining, establishing or operating\\" ROTC on its campus. Such universities are allowed to require that ROTC adhere to the same policies as the university's other academic programs. According to Diane Mazur of the Palm Center, the military has withdrawn ROTC from a number of universities rather than adapt to those policies or accept extracurricular status. In her analysis, both the military and academe (as of the fall of 2010) preferred not to dispute the public perception that elite universities had banned ROTC programs. She wrote: Others argue that universities effectively ban ROTC by erecting procedural hurdles motivated by anti-military sentiment and objections to discrimination based on sexual orientation that only serve to \\"discourage their own presumably egalitarian, intelligent, and enlightened students from joining\\".Stanford Review: Yishai Kabaker, \\"Stanford's Anti-ROTC Policy is Self-Contradictory,\\" April 27, 2007 , accessed March 12, 2012 ROTC programs were subject to the military's ban on service by open gays and lesbians known as \\"Don't ask don't tell\\". LGBT students occasionally protested ROTC as a proxy for the policy.Columbia Spectator: Robert McCaughey, \\"Don't wait, don't stall,\\" February 18, 2010 , accessed March 12, 2012Harvard Crimson:Eric S. Solowey and Lisa A. Taggart, \\"Students Plan ROTC Protests,\\" April 25, 1989 , accessed March 12, 2012 An act to repeal the policy was signed by President Barack Obama on December 22, 2010 and implementation took effect September 20, 2011. Non-U.S. ROTC programs Other national armed forces in countries with strong historical ties to the United States have ROTC programs. * ROTP in Canada is a named academic training program for officer entry into the Canadian Armed Forces. Where educational requirements for specific programs are not available at Royal Military College, cadets may attend courses on suitable colleges or universities anywhere in Canada. There is little formal military training during the academic year. However, they are subject to educational institution-specific military law and regulations. * Officers' Training Corps for the British Army was set up in 1908. The University Air Squadron for the Royal Air Force and the University Royal Navy Unit for the Royal Navy are similar. Although all members are commissioned as under officers in their respective services, they are employed on a territorial class B commission and there is no obligation to serve as a regular officer. * ROTC in the Philippines began in 1912 during American colonial rule with the creation of the first unit at the University of the Philippines. The National ROTC Alumni Association (NRAA) of the Philippines estimates that 75 percent of the officer corps of the Armed Forces of the Philippines come from ROTC. * ROTC in South Korea started in 1961. * ROTC in Taiwan started in the 1960s with training courses being severely reduced over the years as an experiment before it was implemented again in 1997. Other countries have also institutionalized reservist training programs. Reserve Officer Training in Russia began in the 1920s, Brazil has the CPOR and the NPOR since 1928, difference being that the officer formed by the CPOR choose their area while specialization while the officer formed by the NPOR learn from their local army base. Student Army Training Corps (SATC) During World War I, the United States created the Student Army Training Corps in an effort to encourage young men to receive both a college education and train for the military simultaneously. Those young men who did exceptionally well in the SATC classes were recommended for classes in the ROTC. On February 10, 1918, the War Department created the Committee on Education and Special Training. The purpose of this committee was to assess the needs of the military branches and attend to said needs. Seeing a drastic need for trained soldiers, the Student Army Training Corps was created to provide \\"special training for men entering the service through voluntary induction\\". Training camps were held in the summer of 1918 to prepare institutions with at least one-hundred male students for the induction of the SATC that fall. Training started July 18 and lasted for sixty days. The SATC officially began on October 1, 1918. It was located on 525 educational institutions and inducted 200,000 total students on the first day. Unlike the Selective Service Draft, enrollment in the SATC was completely voluntary. However, doing so gave you the rank of private in the United States army, therefore this was not a way of avoiding enlistment. While attending the SATC did allow for young men to stay on the home front, the ultimate goal of this was creating trained soldiers for the military. The SATC was short lived. With the Armistice being signed on November 11, 1918 the Army's need for more soldiers ended. The SATC was disbanded in December 1918.

He was born in Leeds and he received his education in Classics from Leeds Grammar School and Leeds University. He is one of Britain's foremost verse writers and many of his works have been performed at the Royal National Theatre. He is noted for controversial works such as the poem \\"V\\", as well as his versions of dramatic works: from ancient Greek such as the tragedies Oresteia and Lysistrata, from French Moli√®re's The Misanthrope, from Middle English The Mysteries. He is also noted for his outspoken views, particularly those on the Iraq War. In 2015, he was honoured with the David Cohen Prize in recognition for his body of work.Jonathan McAloon, poet Tony Harrison wins David Cohen Prize for Literature 2015, Telegraph, 26 February 2015. Works Adaptation of the English Medieval Mystery Plays, based on the York and Wakefield cycles, The Mysteries, were first performed in 1985 by the Royal National Theatre. Interviewed by Melvyn Bragg for BBC television in 2012, Harrison said: \\"It was only when I did the Mystery Plays and got Northern actors doing verse, that I felt that I was reclaiming the energy of classical verse in the voices that it was created for.\\"\\"Melvyn Bragg on Class and Culture: Episode 2, BBC2, broadcast 2 March 2012 One of his best-known works is the long poem \\"V\\" (1985), written during the miners' strike of 1984‚Äì85, and describing a trip to see his parents' grave in Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston, Leeds, 'now littered with beer cans and vandalised by obscene graffiti'. The title has several possible interpretations: victory, versus, verse, etc. Proposals to screen a filmed version of 'v.' by Channel 4 in October 1987 drew howls of outrage from the tabloid press, some broadsheet journalists, and MPs, apparently concerned about the effects its \\"torrents of obscene language\\" and \\"streams of four-letter filth\\" would have on the nation's youth. Indeed, an Early Day Motion entitled \\"Television Obscenity\\" was proposed on 27 October 1987 by a group of Conservative MPs, who condemned Channel 4 and the Independent Broadcasting Authority. The motion was opposed only by MP Norman Buchan, who suggested that fellow members had either failed to read or failed to understand the poem. The broadcast went ahead and, after widespread press coverage, the uproar subsided. Gerald Howarth MP said that Harrison was \\"Probably another bolshie poet wishing to impose his frustrations on the rest of us\\". When told of this, Harrison retorted that Howarth was \\"Probably another idiot MP wishing to impose his intellectual limitations on the rest of us\\". Reception Richard Eyre calls Harrison's 1990 play, The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus \\"among the five most imaginative pieces of drama in the 90s\\". Jocelyn Herbert, famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison is aware of the dramatic visual impact of his ideas: \\"The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage. Some writers just write and have little idea what it will look like, but Tony always knows exactly what he wants.\\" Edith Hall has written that she is convinced that Harrison's 1998 film-poem Prometheus is \\"artistic reaction to the fall of the British working class\\" at the end of the twentieth century, and considers it as \\"the most important adaptation of classical myth for a radical political purpose for years\\" and Harrison's \\"most brilliant artwork, with the possible exception of his stage play The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus\\". Professor Roger Griffin of the Department of History at Oxford Brookes University, in his paper The palingenetic political community: rethinking the legitimation of totalitarian regimes in inter-war Europe, describes Harrison's film-poem as \\"magnificent\\" and suggests that Harrison is trying to tell his audience \\"To avoid falling prey to the collective mirage of a new order, to stay wide awake while others succumb to the lethe of the group mind, to resist the gaze of modern Gorgons\\".

She is a professor of contemporary poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and was appointed Poet Laureate in May 2009, resigning in 2019. She is the first woman, the first Scottish-born poet and the first known LGBT poet to hold the position. Her collections include Standing Female Nude (1985), winner of a Scottish Arts Council Award; Selling Manhattan (1987), which won a Somerset Maugham Award; Mean Time (1993), which won the Whitbread Poetry Award; and Rapture (2005), winner of the T. S. Eliot Prize. Her poems address issues such as oppression, gender, and violence in an accessible language that has made them popular in schools. Early life Carol Ann Duffy was born to a Roman Catholic family in the Gorbals, a poor part of Glasgow. She was the daughter of Mary (n√©e Black) and Frank Duffy, an electrical fitter. Her mother's parents were Irish, and her father had Irish grandparents. The eldest of five siblings, she has four brothers; Frank, Adrian, Eugene and Tim. The family moved to Stafford, England, when Duffy was six years old. Her father worked for English Electric. A trade unionist, he stood unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate for the Labour Party in 1983 in addition to managing Stafford F.C. football club. Duffy was educated in Stafford at Saint Austin's RC Primary School (1962‚Äì1967), St. Joseph's Convent School (1967‚Äì1970), and Stafford Girls' High School (1970‚Äì1974), her literary talent encouraged by two English teachers, June Scriven at St Joseph's, and Jim Walker at Stafford Girls' High. She was a passionate reader from an early age, and always wanted to be a writer, producing poems from the age of 11. When one of her English teachers died, she wrote: Career When Duffy was 15, June Scriven sent her poems to Outposts, a publisher of pamphlets, where it was read by the bookseller Bernard Stone, who published some of them. When she was 16, she met Adrian Henri, one of the Liverpool poets, and decided she wanted to be with him; she then lived with him until 1982. \\"He gave me confidence,\\" she said, \\"he was great. It was all poetry, very heady, and he was never faithful. He thought poets had a duty to be unfaithful.\\"Winterson, Jeanette. \\"Carol Ann Duffy\\" , Jeanettewinterson.com.

She worked as poetry critic for The Guardian from 1988‚Äì1989, and was editor of the poetry magazine, Ambit. In 1996, she was appointed as a lecturer in poetry at Manchester Metropolitan University, and later became creative director of its Writing School. Duffy was almost appointed Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom in 1999 after the death of Ted Hughes, but lost out on the position to Andrew Motion. Duffy said she would not have accepted the position at that time anyway, because she was in a relationship with Scottish poet Jackie Kay, had a young daughter, and would not have welcomed the public attention.Flood, Alison. \\"Betting closed on next poet laureate amid speculation that Carol Ann Duffy has been chosen\\" , The Guardian, 27 April 2009. In the same year, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. She was appointed as Poet Laureate on 1 May 2009, when Motion's 10-year term was over.

Duffy wrote a 46 line poem Rings for the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. The poem celebrates the rings found in nature and does not specifically mention the couple's names. It begins for both to say and continues \\"I might have raised your hand to the sky / to give you the ring surrounding the moon / or looked to twin the rings of your eyes / with mine / or added a ring to the rings of a tree / by forming a handheld circle with you, thee, / ...\\". She wrote the verse with Stephen Raw, a textual artist, and a signed print of the work was sent to the couple as a wedding gift. Duffy also wrote the poem The Throne, which she composed for the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. In a Stylist magazine, Duffy said of becoming poet laureate, \\"There's no requirement. I do get asked to do things and so far I've been happy to do them.\\" She also spoke about being appointed to the role by Queen Elizabeth II, saying, \\"She's lovely! I met her before I became poet laureate but when I was appointed I had an 'audience' with her which meant we were alone, at the palace, for the first time. We chatted about poetry. Her mother was friends with Ted Hughes whose poetry I admire a lot. We spoke about his influence on me.\\" She stood down as laureate in May 2019. Poetry=Style= Duffy's work explores both everyday experience and the rich fantasy life of herself and others. In dramatizing scenes from childhood, adolescence, and adult life, she discovers moments of consolation through love, memory, and language. Charlotte Mendelson writes in The Observer: > Part of Duffy's talent ‚Äì besides her ear for ordinary eloquence, her > gorgeous, powerful, throwaway lines, her subtlety ‚Äì is her ventriloquism. > Like the best of her novelist peers ... she slides in and out of her > characters' lives on a stream of possessions, aspirations, idioms and turns > of phrase.

Christmas Carol , The Observer, 4 December 2005. Duffy rose to greater prominence in UK poetry circles after her poem \\"Whoever She Was\\" won the Poetry Society National Poetry Competition in 1983. In her first collection, Standing Female Nude (1985), she uses the voices of outsiders, for example in the poems 'Education for Leisure' and 'Dear Norman'. Her next collection Feminine Gospels (2002) continues this vein, showing an increased interest in long narrative poems, accessible in style and often surreal in their imagery. Her 2005 publication, Rapture (2005), is a series of intimate poems charting the course of a love affair, for which she won the ¬£10,000 T.S. Eliot Prize.

The poem begins, \\"Today I am going to kill something. Anything./I have had enough of being ignored and today/I am going to play God.\\" The protagonist kills a fly, then a goldfish. The budgie panics and the cat hides. It ends with him, or her, or them, leaving the house with a knife. \\"The pavements glitter suddenly.

Post-production includes all stages of production occurring after shooting or recording individual program segments. Traditional (analogue) post-production has mostly been replaced by video editing software that operates on a non-linear editing system (NLE). Processes A sound control room at Tainted Blue Studios, 2010 Post- production consists of many different processes grouped under one name. These typically include: * When content is shot on film it is typically transferred to video, DPX, or OpenEXR with a telecine or a more modern Motion picture film scanner. *Editing the content of the film or television program. * Writing, (re)recording, and editing the soundtrack. * Adding visual effects ‚Äì mainly computer-generated imagery (CGI) which is then composited into the frame. * Sound design, sound effects, ADR, foley, and music, culminating in a process known as sound re-recording or mixing with professional audio equipment. *Stereoscopic 3D conversion in the case of content that was shot in 2D which is scheduled to have a 3D release *Color grading (and color correction) in a color suite. The post-production phase of creating a film usually takes longer than the actual shooting of the film and can take several months to complete because it includes the complete editing, color correction, and the addition of music and sound. The process of editing a movie is also seen as the second directing because through post-production it is possible to change the intention of the movie. Furthermore, through the use of color grading tools and the addition of music and sound, the atmosphere of the movie can be heavily influenced. For instance, a blue-tinted movie is associated with a cold atmosphere and the choice of music and sound increases the effect of the shown scenes to the audience. Post-production was named a \\"dying industry\\" by Phil Izzo of the Wall Street Journal in 2011. Top 10 Dying Industries, The Wall Street Journal/economics By Phil Izzo The once exclusive service offered by high-end post-production facilities have been eroded away by video editing software solutions that operate on a non-linear editing system (NLE). As such, many parts of a traditional (analogue) post-production pipeline have been largely surpassed by newer digital workflows. Television In television, the phases of post-production include: editing, video editing, sound editing, animation and visual effects insertions, viewing and the start of the airing process. Photography Professional post-producers usually apply a certain range of image editing operations to the raw image format provided by a photographer or an image-bank. There is a range of proprietary and free and open-source software, running on a range of operating systems available to do this work. The first of post-production usually requires loading the raw images into the post-production software. If there is more than one image, and they belong to a set, ideally post-producers try to equalize the images before loading them. After that, if necessary, the next step would be to cut the objects in the images with the Pen Tool for a perfect and clean cut. The next stage would be cleaning the image using tools such as the healing tool, clone tool, and patch tool. The next stages depend on what the client ordered. If it's a photo-montage, the post-producers would usually start assembling the different images into the final document, and start to integrate the images with the background. In advertising, it usually requires assembling several images together in a photo-composition. Types of work usually done: * Advertising that requires one background (as one or more images to assemble) and one or more models. (Usually, the most time-consuming, as often these are image bank images which don't have much quality, and they all have different light and color as they were not controlled by only one photographer in one set location) * Product-photography that usually requires several images of the same object with different lights, and assembled together, to control light and unwanted reflections, or to assemble parts that would be difficult to get in one shot, such as a beer glass for a beer advertising. (Sometimes to composite one image of a beer glass it requires four or five images: one for the base, one for the beer, one for the label, one for the foam, and one or more for splashing beer if that is desired) * Fashion photography that usually requires a really heavy post-production for editorial or advertising Music Techniques used in music post-production include comping (compiling the best portions of multiple takes into one superior take), timing and pitch correction (perhaps through beat quantization), and adding effects. This process is typically referred to as mixing and can also involve equalization and adjusting the levels of each individual track to provide an optimal sound experience.Hodgson, Jay Understanding Records, p.231. .

Position  The source of the Goyt River is on Axe Edge Moor above Goyt's Moss to the south. The western side of the valley is a long ridge, running from Shining Tor to Windgather Rocks, which forms the county boundary between Derbyshire and Cheshire; the boundary formerly followed the river itself. The eastern side of the valley rises to Burbage Edge, overlooking Buxton, and Combs Moss. Derbyshire Bridge The old stone Derbyshire Bridge gets its name from it being at the historic boundary from Cheshire into Derbyshire. The road south out of the Goyt Valley is one-way and crosses the bridge.  History  The Street Roman road runs alongside Errwood Reservoir and to the west of Fernilee Reservoir. The disused Cromford and High Peak Railway line (which connected the High Peak canal at Whaley Bridge with the River Derwent in Cromford since 1831) runs along the east side of the reservoirs. This stretch of the railway line was closed in 1896. The Fernilee gunpowder mill operated in the valley from about 1800 at the site of Fernilee Reservoir. It was acquired in 1888 by Chilworth Gunpowder Company and expanded before closing in 1920, after numerous fatal accidents. Spanish Shrine on Errwood Estate Errwood Hall was the Victorian mansion of the Grimshawe family, built in about 1840 but it is now in ruins. Below Foxlow Edge there is a Spanish shrine, built in 1889 in memory of Miss Dolores (a friend of the Grimshawe family). The shrine is a designated Grade II listed building. A local legend tells that Pym Chair is the spot where a highway man called Pym robbed passers by on the packhorse route. However another story is that Pym was a preacher who gave sermons there. = Reservoirs = The valley floor is now dominated by two drinking-water reservoirs, fed by the River Goyt. Both reservoirs were built by the Stockport Corporation Waterworks (after they acquired the Grimshawe estate) to provide drinking water for Stockport town and the surrounding area. Fernilee Reservoir was completed in 1938 and the hamlet of Goyt's Bridge and Errwood Hall were destroyed to prevent any pollution of the water. Errwood Reservoir was completed in 1967. A spectacular suspension bridge once crossed the river but it was demolished to make way for Errwood Reservoir. An old packhorse bridge was saved and reconstructed near Goytsclough Quarry. The reservoirs and much of the surrounding land is currently owned by United Utilities.  Moorland  The open gritstone moorlands of the Upper Goyt Valley (Wild Moor, Goyt's Moss, Burbage Edge, Shining Tor to Cats Tor ridge and Hop Moor) are a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Heather is the main plant but the heathland is habitat for a variety of native grasses, rushes, sedges and shrubs including bilberry, crowberry, cowberry and cross-leaved heath. Hare‚Äôs-tail cottongrass and sphagnum moss are common along the Shining Tor ridge. The area is important for upland breeding birds including a large population of golden plover, as well as red grouse, curlew, lapwing, whinchat, snipe, twite, ring ouzel and merlin. Along Goyt‚Äôs Clough (by the River Goyt from Derbyshire Bridge down to Errwood Reservoir) there are common sandpiper and dipper and the old commoner woodland includes oak, birch, rowan and alder.  Tourism  The valley has been a popular tourist destination since the 19th century. Errwood Sailing Club operates at Errwood Reservoir. The Peak District Boundary Walk from Buxton follows the disused railway line into the Valley from the south east, crosses the Errwood Dam and then tracks along the west side of the Fernilee reservoir. There are two large car parks in the central valley at The Street and Errwood Hall. There are smaller car parks at Derbyshire Bridge to the south and at the northern end of Fernilee Reservoir. There are extensive footpaths through the valley.

The languages may be genetically unrelated, or only distantly related, but the sprachbund characteristics might give a false appearance of relatedness. History In a 1904 paper, Jan Baudouin de Courtenay emphasised the need to distinguish between language similarities arising from a genetic relationship (rodstvo) and those arising from convergence due to language contact (srodstvo). Nikolai Trubetzkoy introduced the Russian term (; \\"language union\\") in a 1923 article. In a paper presented to the first International Congress of Linguists in 1928, he used a German calque of this term, Sprachbund, defining it as a group of languages with similarities in syntax, morphological structure, cultural vocabulary and sound systems, but without systematic sound correspondences, shared basic morphology or shared basic vocabulary. Later workers, starting with Trubetzkoy's colleague Roman Jakobson, reprinted in R. Jakobson: Selected writings, vol. 1: Phonological Studies. The Hague: Mouton de Gruyter, 1971, pp. 137‚Äì148. have relaxed the requirement of similarities in all four of the areas stipulated by Trubetzkoy. Examples=The Balkans= The idea of areal convergence is commonly attributed to Jernej Kopitar's description in 1830 of Albanian, Bulgarian and Romanian as giving the impression of \\"nur eine Sprachform ... mit dreierlei Sprachmaterie\\",Jernej K. Kopitar, ‚ÄúAlbanische, walachische und bulgarische Sprache‚Äù, Wiener Jahrb√ºcher der Literatur 46 (1830): 59‚Äì106. which has been rendered by Victor Friedman as \\"one grammar with the three lexicons\\". The Balkan Sprachbund comprises Albanian, Romanian, the South Slavic languages of the southern Balkans (Bulgarian, Macedonian and to a lesser degree Serbo- Croatian), Greek, Balkan Turkish, and Romani. All but one of these are Indo- European languages but from very divergent branches, and Turkish is a Turkic language. Yet they have exhibited several signs of grammatical convergence, such as avoidance of the infinitive, future tense formation, and others. The same features are not found in other languages that are otherwise closely related, such as the other Romance languages in relation to Romanian, and the other Slavic languages such as Polish in relation to Bulgaro-Macedonian. =Indian subcontinent= In a classic 1956 paper titled \\"India as a Linguistic Area\\", Murray Emeneau laid the groundwork for the general acceptance of the concept of a sprachbund. In the paper, Emeneau observed that the subcontinent's Dravidian and Indo-Aryan languages shared a number of features that were not inherited from a common source, but were areal features, the result of diffusion during sustained contact. These include retroflex consonants, echo words, subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb word order, discourse markers, and the quotative. Emeneau specified the tools to establish that language and culture had fused for centuries on the Indian soil to produce an integrated mosaic of structural convergence of four distinct language families: Indo-Aryan, Dravidian, Munda and Tibeto-Burman. This concept provided scholarly substance for explaining the underlying Indian-ness of apparently divergent cultural and linguistic patterns. With his further contributions, this area has now become a major field of research in language contact and convergence. =Mainland Southeast Asia= The Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area is one of the most dramatic of linguistic areas in terms of the surface similarity of the languages involved, to the extent that early linguists tended to group them all into a single family, although the modern consensus places them into numerous unrelated families. The area stretches from Thailand to China and is home to speakers of languages of the Sino- Tibetan, Hmong‚ÄìMien (or Miao‚ÄìYao), Tai‚ÄìKadai, Austronesian (represented by Chamic) and Mon‚ÄìKhmer families. Neighbouring languages across these families, though presumed unrelated, often have similar features, which are believed to have spread by diffusion. A well-known example is the similar tone systems in Sinitic languages (Sino-Tibetan), Hmong‚ÄìMien, Tai languages (Kadai) and Vietnamese (Mon‚ÄìKhmer). Most of these languages passed through an earlier stage with three tones on most syllables (but no tonal distinctions on checked syllables ending in a stop consonant), which was followed by a tone split where the distinction between voiced and voiceless consonants disappeared but in compensation the number of tones doubled. These parallels led to confusion over the classification of these languages, until Andr√©-Georges Haudricourt showed in 1954 that tone was not an invariant feature, by demonstrating that Vietnamese tones corresponded to certain final consonants in other languages of the Mon‚ÄìKhmer family, and proposed that tone in the other languages had a similar origin. Similarly, the unrelated Khmer (Mon‚ÄìKhmer), Cham (Austronesian) and Lao (Kadai) languages have almost identical vowel systems. Many languages in the region are of the isolating (or analytic) type, with mostly monosyllabic morphemes and little use of inflection or affixes, though a number of Mon‚ÄìKhmer languages have derivational morphology. Shared syntactic features include classifiers, object‚Äìverb order and topic‚Äìcomment structure, though in each case there are exceptions in branches of one or more families. =Northeast Asia= Some linguists, such as Matthias Castr√©n, G. J. Ramstedt, Nicholas Poppe and Pentti Aalto supported the idea that the Mongolic, Turkic, and Tungusic families of Asia (and some small parts of Europe) are genetically related, in a controversial group they call Altaic. Koreanic and Japonic languages, which are also hypothetically related according to some scholars like William George Aston, Sh≈çsabur≈ç Kanazawa, Samuel Martin and Sergei Starostin, are sometimes included as part of the purported Altaic family. This latter hypothesis was supported by people including Roy Andrew Miller, John C. Street and Karl Heinrich Menges. Gerard Clauson, Gerhard Doerfer, Juha Janhunen, Stefan Georg and others dispute or reject this. A common alternative explanation for similarities between said Altaic languages such as vowel harmony and agglutination is that they are due to areal diffusion. =Others= * Sumerian and Akkadian in the 3rd millennium BC * in the Ethiopian highlands, Ethiopian Language Area * Spanish and Arabic in the Muslim rule in the Iberian Peninsula.

(Credit: ESO) A photograph of the sea after sunset with an exposure time of 15 seconds. The swell from the waves appears foggy. A photograph of Fort du Salbert taken by moonlight with an exposure time of ten minutes. In photography, exposure is the amount of light per unit area (the image plane illuminance times the exposure time) reaching a frame of photographic film or the surface of an electronic image sensor, as determined by shutter speed, lens aperture, and scene luminance. Exposure is measured in lux seconds, and can be computed from exposure value (EV) and scene luminance in a specified region. An \\"exposure\\" is a single shutter cycle. For example, a long exposure refers to a single, long shutter cycle to gather enough dim light, whereas a multiple exposure involves a series of shutter cycles, effectively layering a series of photographs in one image. The accumulated photometric exposure (Hv) is the same so long as the total exposure time is the same. Definitions=Radiant exposure= Radiant exposure of a surface, denoted He (\\"e\\" for \\"energetic\\", to avoid confusion with photometric quantities) and measured in , is given by :H_\\\\mathrm{e} = E_\\\\mathrm{e}t, where *Ee is the irradiance of the surface, measured in ; *t is the exposure duration, measured in s. =Luminous exposure= Luminous exposure of a surface,National Institute of Standards and Technology . Retrieved Feb 2009. denoted Hv (\\"v\\" for \\"visual\\", to avoid confusion with radiometric quantities) and measured in , is given by :H_\\\\mathrm{v} = E_\\\\mathrm{v}t, where *Ev is the illuminance of the surface, measured in lx; *t is the exposure duration, measured in s. If the measurement is adjusted to account only for light that reacts with the photo-sensitive surface, that is, weighted by the appropriate spectral sensitivity, the exposure is still measured in radiometric units (joules per square meter), rather than photometric units (weighted by the nominal sensitivity of the human eye). Only in this appropriately weighted case does the H measure the effective amount of light falling on the film, such that the characteristic curve will be correct independent of the spectrum of the light. Many photographic materials are also sensitive to \\"invisible\\" light, which can be a nuisance (see UV filter and IR filter), or a benefit (see infrared photography and full-spectrum photography). The use of radiometric units is appropriate to characterize such sensitivity to invisible light. In sensitometric data, such as characteristic curves, the log exposure is conventionally expressed as log10(H). Photographers more familiar with base-2 logarithmic scales (such as exposure values) can convert using . Optimum exposure \\"Correct\\" exposure may be defined as an exposure that achieves the effect the photographer intended.Peterson, Bryan, \\"Understanding Exposure\\", 2004, : p.14 A more technical approach recognises that a photographic film (or sensor) has a physically limited useful exposure range,Ray, S.F. et al. 2000 \\"The Manual of Photography\\" Focal Press, , p.230 sometimes called its dynamic range.Ray, S.F. et al. 2000 \\"The Manual of Photography\\" Focal Press, , p.121 and p.245 If, for any part of the photograph, the actual exposure is outside this range, the film cannot record it accurately. In a very simple model, for example, out-of-range values would be recorded as \\"black\\" (underexposed) or \\"white\\" (overexposed) rather than the precisely graduated shades of colour and tone required to describe \\"detail\\". Therefore, the purpose of exposure adjustment (and/or lighting adjustment) is to control the physical amount of light from the subject that is allowed to fall on the film, so that 'significant' areas of shadow and highlight detail do not exceed the film's useful exposure range. This ensures that no 'significant' information is lost during capture. The photographer may carefully overexpose or underexpose the photograph to eliminate \\"insignificant\\" or \\"unwanted\\" detail; to make, for example, a white altar cloth appear immaculately clean, or to emulate the heavy, pitiless shadows of film noir. However, it is technically much easier to discard recorded information during post processing than to try to 're-create' unrecorded information. In a scene with strong or harsh lighting, the ratio between highlight and shadow luminance values may well be larger than the ratio between the film's maximum and minimum useful exposure values. In this case, adjusting the camera's exposure settings (which only applies changes to the whole image, not selectively to parts of the image) only allows the photographer to choose between underexposed shadows or overexposed highlights; it cannot bring both into the useful exposure range at the same time. Methods for dealing with this situation include: using what is called fill lighting to increase the illumination in shadow areas; using a graduated neutral-density filter, flag, scrim, or gobo to reduce the illumination falling upon areas deemed too bright; or varying the exposure between multiple, otherwise identical, photographs (exposure bracketing) and then combining them afterwards in an HDRI process. =Overexposure and underexposure= White chair: Deliberate use of overexposure for aesthetic purposes. A photograph may be described as overexposed when it has a loss of highlight detail, that is, when important bright parts of an image are \\"washed out\\" or effectively all white, known as \\"blown-out highlights\\" or \\"clipped whites\\". A photograph may be described as underexposed when it has a loss of shadow detail, that is, when important dark areas are \\"muddy\\" or indistinguishable from black, known as \\"blocked-up shadows\\" (or sometimes \\"crushed shadows\\", \\"crushed blacks\\", or \\"clipped blacks\\", especially in video). As the adjacent image shows, these terms are technical ones rather than artistic judgments; an overexposed or underexposed image may be \\"correct\\" in the sense that it provides the effect that the photographer intended. Exposure_compensationIntentionally over- or underexposing (relative to a standard or the camera's automatic exposure) is casually referred to as \\"exposing to the right\\" or \\"exposing to the left\\" respectively, as these shift the histogram of the image to the right or left. Exposure settings Two similar images, one taken in auto mode (underexposed), the other with manual settings. =Manual exposure= In manual mode, the photographer adjusts the lens aperture and/or shutter speed to achieve the desired exposure. Many photographers choose to control aperture and shutter independently because opening up the aperture increases exposure, but also decreases the depth of field, and a slower shutter increases exposure but also increases the opportunity for motion blur. \\"Manual\\" exposure calculations may be based on some method of light metering with a working knowledge of exposure values, the APEX system and/or the Zone System. =Automatic exposure= exposure time of 0,005 s A camera in automatic exposure or autoexposure (usually initialized as AE) mode automatically calculates and adjusts exposure settings to match (as closely as possible) the subject's mid-tone to the mid-tone of the photograph. For most cameras, this means using an on-board TTL exposure meter. Aperture priority (commonly abbreviated as A, or Av for aperture value) mode gives the photographer manual control of the aperture, whilst the camera automatically adjusts the shutter speed to achieve the exposure specified by the TTL meter. Shutter priority (often abbreviated as S, or Tv for time value) mode gives manual shutter control, with automatic aperture compensation. In each case, the actual exposure level is still determined by the camera's exposure meter. =Exposure compensation= A street view of Taka-T√∂√∂l√∂, Helsinki, Finland, during a very sunny winter day. The image has been deliberately overexposed by +1 EV to compensate for the bright sunlight and the exposure time calculated by the camera's program automatic metering is still 1/320 s. The purpose of an exposure meter is to estimate the subject's mid-tone luminance and indicate the camera exposure settings required to record this as a mid-tone. In order to do this it has to make a number of assumptions which, under certain circumstances, will be wrong. If the exposure setting indicated by an exposure meter is taken as the \\"reference\\" exposure, the photographer may wish to deliberately overexpose or underexpose in order to compensate for known or anticipated metering inaccuracies. Cameras with any kind of internal exposure meter usually feature an exposure compensation setting which is intended to allow the photographer to simply offset the exposure level from the internal meter's estimate of appropriate exposure. Frequently calibrated in stops, also known as EV units, a \\"+1\\" exposure compensation setting indicates one stop more (twice as much) exposure and \\"‚Äì1\\" means one stop less (half as much) exposure. Exposure compensation is particularly useful in combination with auto-exposure mode, as it allows the photographer to bias the exposure level without resorting to full manual exposure and losing the flexibility of auto exposure. On low-end video camcorders, exposure compensation may be the only manual exposure control available. Exposure control A 1/30 s exposure showing motion blur on fountain at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew A 1/320 s exposure showing individual drops on fountain at Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew An appropriate exposure for a photograph is determined by the sensitivity of the medium used. For photographic film, sensitivity is referred to as film speed and is measured on a scale published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Faster film, that is, film with a higher ISO rating, requires less exposure to make a readable image. Digital cameras usually have variable ISO settings that provide additional flexibility. Exposure is a combination of the length of time and the illuminance at the photosensitive material. Exposure time is controlled in a camera by shutter speed, and the illuminance depends on the lens aperture and the scene luminance. Slower shutter speeds (exposing the medium for a longer period of time), greater lens apertures (admitting more light), and higher-luminance scenes produce greater exposures. An approximately correct exposure will be obtained on a sunny day using ISO 100 film, an aperture of and a shutter speed of 1/100 of a second. This is called the sunny 16 rule: at an aperture of on a sunny day, a suitable shutter speed will be one over the film speed (or closest equivalent). A scene can be exposed in many ways, depending on the desired effect a photographer wishes to convey. Reciprocity An important principle of exposure is reciprocity. If one exposes the film or sensor for a longer period, a reciprocally smaller aperture is required to reduce the amount of light hitting the film to obtain the same exposure. For example, the photographer may prefer to make his sunny-16 shot at an aperture of (to obtain a shallow depth of field). As is 3 stops \\"faster\\" than , with each stop meaning double the amount of light, a new shutter speed of (1/125)/(2¬∑2¬∑2) = 1/1000 s is needed. Once the photographer has determined the exposure, aperture stops can be traded for halvings or doublings of speed, within limits. A demonstration of the effect of exposure in night photography. Longer shutter speeds result in increased exposure. The true characteristic of most photographic emulsions is not actually linear (see sensitometry), but it is close enough over the exposure range of about 1 second to 1/1000 of a second. Outside of this range, it becomes necessary to increase the exposure from the calculated value to account for this characteristic of the emulsion. This characteristic is known as reciprocity failure. The film manufacturer's data sheets should be consulted to arrive at the correction required, as different emulsions have different characteristics. Digital camera image sensors can also be subject to a form of reciprocity failure. Determining exposure A fair ride taken with a 2/5 second exposure. The Zone System is another method of determining exposure and development combinations to achieve a greater tonality range over conventional methods by varying the contrast of the film to fit the print contrast capability. Digital cameras can achieve similar results (high dynamic range) by combining several different exposures (varying shutter or diaphragm) made in quick succession. Today, most cameras automatically determine the correct exposure at the time of taking a photograph by using a built-in light meter, or multiple point meters interpreted by a built-in computer, see metering mode. Negative/Print film tends to bias for exposing for the shadow areas (film dislikes being starved of light), with digital favouring exposure for highlights. See latitude below. Latitude Example image exhibiting blown-out highlights. Top: original image, bottom: blown-out areas marked red Latitude is the degree by which one can over, or under expose an image, and still recover an acceptable level of quality from an exposure. Typically negative film has a better ability to record a range of brightness than slide/transparency film or digital. Digital should be considered to be the reverse of print film, with a good latitude in the shadow range, and a narrow one in the highlight area; in contrast to film's large highlight latitude, and narrow shadow latitude. Slide/Transparency film has a narrow latitude in both highlight and shadow areas, requiring greater exposure accuracy. Negative film's latitude increases somewhat with high ISO material, in contrast digital tends to narrow on latitude with high ISO settings. =Highlights= Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme brightness are described as having \\"blown-out highlights\\" or \\"flared highlights\\". In digital images this information loss is often irreversible, though small problems can be made less noticeable using photo manipulation software. Recording to RAW format can correct this problem to some degree, as can using a digital camera with a better sensor. Film can often have areas of extreme overexposure but still record detail in those areas. This information is usually somewhat recoverable when printing or transferring to digital. A loss of highlights in a photograph is usually undesirable, but in some cases can be considered to \\"enhance\\" appeal. Examples include black-and-white photography and portraits with an out-of-focus background. =Blacks= Areas of a photo where information is lost due to extreme darkness are described as \\"crushed blacks\\". Digital capture tends to be more tolerant of underexposure, allowing better recovery of shadow detail, than same-ISO negative print film. Crushed blacks cause loss of detail, but can be used for artistic effect.

The name of the river (earlier Daven) is probably from the Old Welsh dafn, meaning a \\"drop or trickle\\", implying a slow-moving river.  Course  It forms the border between first Cheshire and Derbyshire on the west and east, and then between Cheshire and Staffordshire where it then flows north-west through Cheshire before meeting the Weaver near Northwich. The river rises close to the source of the River Goyt just to the south west of Buxton, at Dane Head on Axe Edge Moor. Flowing southwest, it forms county borders for around before flowing west through Congleton and past Holmes Chapel. The point on the river where the three counties meet, at Panniers' Pool Bridge, is called Three Shire Heads (sometimes Three Shires Head).Walks in the UK Peak District - Axe Edge Moor, Buxton's coal mining district Passing just north of Middlewich, it merges first with the River Croco near the site of the old Roman fort in Harbutt's Field, and then with the River Wheelock near the aqueduct carrying the Trent and Mersey Canal, and runs the remaining north to Northwich where it flows into the River Weaver. The River Dane is the longest, cleanest and thought to be the fastest flowing river through Cheshire. The route of the Dane is followed as closely as possible by the Dane Valley Way, a walking route from Buxton to Northwich. Although the main river is part of the Mersey catchment and flows into the Irish Sea, a portion of the water can be diverted via canal feeders into Rudyard Lake and subsequently the Caldon Canal. This water discharges eventually into the River Trent and ultimately into the North Sea, having crossed the English watershed.

It has 23 arches and is a Scheduled Monument. It crosses the River Dane at Saltersford where Cheshire salt traders drove their horse-drawn carts through a ford along the toll road. Nearby downstream is the small stone Hermitage Bridge built in 1772. Some years the river floods widely across the meadows here. In 1451 when the River Dane flooded in Congleton, it destroyed the town's corn mill, half of the timber-framed buildings and the wooden bridge over the river. To prevent it happening again the river was diverted away from the town. Congleton's textile industry grew from the 14th-century, with many water-powered mills built along the river by the 18th-century. Heading downstream: Dane Bridge, Hug Bridge, Lymford Bridge (early 19th century), Macclesfield Canal Aqueduct (1830), Congleton Railway Viaduct (West Coast Main Line, 1849), Colley Mill Bridge, Havannah Bridge (early to mid-19th century, originally leading to a cigar factory), Hermitage Bridge (1772), and Shipbrook Bridge are all Grade II listed.

It is a tributary of the River Dove (which also flows through the Peak District, forming the boundary between Derbyshire and Staffordshire). The Manifold rises at Flash Head just south of Buxton near Axe Edge, at the northern edge of the White Peak, known for its limestone beds. It continues for before it joins the Dove. For part of its course, it runs underground (except when in spate), from Wetton Mill to Ilam. During this section it is joined by its major tributary, the River Hamps. Villages on the river include Longnor, Hulme End and Ilam. Its name may come from Anglo-Saxon manig-fald = \\"many folds\\", referring to its meanders. Manifold Way The Manifold Way is an long- distance footpath from Hulme End to Waterhouses, along the former route of the narrow-gauge (2' 6\\") Leek and Manifold Valley Light Railway which operated between 1904 and 1934. Opened in July 1937 after the LMS handed over the trackbed to Staffordshire County Council, it is tarmacked throughout. The Manifold Valley Visitor Centre is housed in Hulme End Station, which also has a model of the railway. Limestone crags and caves The limestone cliffs that fringe the valley contain several rock-climbing areas, and named rock features, including Thor's Cave () and Beeston Tor (), which overlooks the confluence with the River Hamps. Mining in the Manifold valley The Manifold valley was famous for the mining of copper and lead, and the mines at Ecton were some of the richest in the country. The discovery of Stone Age implements in some of the caves imply that minerals were mined around the Manifold valley thousands of years ago. Nowadays there is little trace of the industry that made many people (mainly the Duke of Devonshire who at one time owned the Ecton mines) very rich. The main areas of interest are around Ecton where the old spoil banks and the old engine house still remain. Ecology The river has been noted as being important for European bullhead and lamprey. In the underground section of the river where it resurfaces at Ilam, the bullhead have no pigmentation. It was previously a bastion for white-clawed crayfish, but most of the species in this river were killed off with Crayfish plague in 2008. Crayfish have been noted in the tributaries of the Manifold and it is hoped that re-colonisation can be achieved by the surviving upstream crayfish.

Apple also released Cyberdog 2.0 with Mac OS 8.0, allowing Mac Runtime for Java to be utilized and also had minor bugs with OpenDoc fixed.  Overview  Cyberdog included email and news readers, a web browser and address book management components, as well as drag and drop FTP. OpenDoc allowed these components to be reused and embedded in other documents by the user. For instance, a \\"live\\" Cyberdog web page could be embedded in a presentation program, one of the common demonstrations of OpenDoc. A serious problem with the OpenDoc project that Cyberdog depended on, was that it was part of a very acrimonious competition between OpenDoc consortium members and Microsoft. The members of the OpenDoc alliance were all trying to obtain traction in a market rapidly being dominated by Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer. At the same time, Microsoft used the synergy between the OS and applications divisions of the company to make it effectively mandatory that developers adopt the competing Microsoft Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) technology. OpenDoc was forced to create an interoperability layer in order to allow developers to use it, and this added a great technical burden to the project. An offspring of Cyberdog called Subwoofer had been developed in parallel and was aimed at providing software developers with a simple library for integrating web communication protocols into applications. The project was completed after the cancellation of Cyberdog and released at the MacHack 1997 conference by Sari Harrison and Fr√©d√©ric Artru. Subwoofer evolved into the URL Access library shipped with Mac OS 8.6.http://db.tidbits.com/article/5396?print_version=1  Cancellation  OpenDoc had several hundred developers signed up, but the timing was poor. Apple Computer was rapidly losing money at the time. Before long, OpenDoc was scrapped, with Steve Jobs noting that they \\"put a bullet through (CyberDog's) head\\", and most of the team was laid off in March 1997. Other sources noted that Microsoft hired away three ClarisWorks developers who were responsible for OpenDoc integration into ClarisWorks. AppleShare IP Manager from versions 5.0 to 6.2 relied on OpenDoc, but AppleShare IP 6.3, the first Mac OS 9 compatible version (released in 1999), eliminated the reliance on OpenDoc. Apple officially relinquished the last trademark on the name OpenDoc on June 11, 2005. OpenDoc had a large memory footprint for the time, and since the OS/2 (Warp 4) versions of OpenDoc were behind schedule, Cyberdog only ran on Macintosh. Moreover, saved documents were not viewable from applications which did not support OpenDoc's Bento format. After Apple terminated Cyberdog along with the rest of OpenDoc, Cyberdog's web browser component grew outdated as web standards evolved.

Since velocity changes instantly in this formalism, the Wiener equation is not suitable for short time scales. In those cases, the Langevin equation, which looks at particle acceleration, must be used. Category:Stochastic differential equations ","title":"Wiener equation"},{"id":"166890","text":"In physics, a Langevin equation (named after Paul Langevin) is a stochastic differential equation describing the time evolution of a subset of the degrees of freedom. These degrees of freedom typically are collective (macroscopic) variables changing only slowly in comparison to the other (microscopic) variables of the system. The fast (microscopic) variables are responsible for the stochastic nature of the Langevin equation. One application is to Brownian motion, calculating the statistics of the random motion of a small particle in a fluid due to collisions with the surrounding molecules in thermal motion.  Brownian motion as a prototype  The original Langevin equation; reviewed by D. S. Lemons & A. Gythiel: Paul Langevin‚Äôs 1908 paper \\"On the Theory of Brownian Motion\\" [...], Am. J. Phys. 65, 1079 (1997), describes Brownian motion, the apparently random movement of a particle in a fluid due to collisions with the molecules of the fluid, :m\\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{v}}{dt}=-\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{v}+\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right). The degrees of freedom of interest here is the velocity \\\\mathbf{v} of the particle, m denotes the particle's mass. The force acting on the particle is written as a sum of a viscous force proportional to the particle's velocity (Stokes' law), and a noise term \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right) (the name given in physical contexts to terms in stochastic differential equations which are stochastic processes) representing the effect of the collisions with the molecules of the fluid. The force \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right) has a Gaussian probability distribution with correlation function :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\eta_{i}\\\\left( t\\\\right)\\\\eta_{j}\\\\left( t^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle =2\\\\lambda k_{B}T\\\\delta _{i,j}\\\\delta \\\\left(t-t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right) , where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature and \\\\eta_i\\\\left( t\\\\right) is the i-th component of the vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right). The \\\\delta-function form of the correlations in time means that the force at a time t is assumed to be completely uncorrelated with the force at any other time. This is an approximation; the actual random force has a nonzero correlation time corresponding to the collision time of the molecules. However, the Langevin equation is used to describe the motion of a \\"macroscopic\\" particle at a much longer time scale, and in this limit the \\\\delta-correlation and the Langevin equation becomes virtually exact. Another prototypical feature of the Langevin equation is the occurrence of the damping coefficient \\\\lambda in the correlation function of the random force, a fact also known as Einstein relation.  Mathematical aspects  A strictly \\\\delta-correlated fluctuating force \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right) is not a function in the usual mathematical sense and even the derivative d\\\\mathbf{v}/dt is not defined in this limit. This problem disappears when the Langevin equation is written in integral form m\\\\mathbf{v}=\\\\int^t\\\\left( -\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf{v}+\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}\\\\left( t\\\\right)\\\\right)dt, and a Langevin equation always should be interpreted as an abbreviation for its time integral. The general mathematical term for equations of this type is \\"stochastic differential equation\\". Another mathematical ambiguity occurs for (rather special) Langevin equations with a multiplicative noise, that is terms like \\\\boldsymbol{v}(t)\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(t) on the r.h.s.. Such equations can be interpreted according to Stratonovich- or Ito- scheme, and if the derivation of the Langevin equation does not tell which one to use it is questionable anyhow. See It≈ç calculus.  Generic Langevin equation  There is a formal derivation of a generic Langevin equation from classical mechanics. This generic equation plays a central role in the theory of critical dynamics, and other areas of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. The equation for Brownian motion above is a special case. An essential condition of the derivation is a criterion dividing the degrees of freedom into the categories slow and fast. For example, local thermodynamic equilibrium in a liquid is reached within a few collision times. But it takes much longer for densities of conserved quantities like mass and energy to relax to equilibrium. Densities of conserved quantities, and in particular their long wavelength components, thus are slow variable candidates. Technically this division is realized with the Zwanzig projection operator, the essential tool in the derivation. The derivation is not completely rigorous because it relies on (plausible) assumptions akin to assumptions required elsewhere in basic statistical mechanics. Let A=\\\\\\\\{A_i\\\\\\\\} denote the slow variables. The generic Langevin equation then reads :\\\\frac{dA_{i}}{dt}=k_{B}T\\\\sum\\\\limits_{j}{\\\\left[ {A_{i},A_{j}}\\\\right] \\\\frac{{d}\\\\mathcal{H}}{{dA_{j}}}}-\\\\sum\\\\limits_{j}{\\\\lambda _{i,j}\\\\left( A\\\\right) \\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{H}}{{dA_{j}}}+}\\\\sum\\\\limits_{j}{\\\\frac{d{\\\\lambda _{i,j}\\\\left(A\\\\right) }}{{dA_{j}}}}+\\\\eta _{i}\\\\left( t\\\\right). The fluctuating force \\\\eta_i\\\\left( t\\\\right) obeys a Gaussian probability distribution with correlation function :\\\\left\\\\langle {\\\\eta _{i}\\\\left( t\\\\right) \\\\eta _{j}\\\\left( t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right) }\\\\right\\\\rangle =2\\\\lambda _{i,j}\\\\left( A\\\\right) \\\\delta \\\\left( t-t^{\\\\prime}\\\\right). This implies the Onsager reciprocity relation \\\\lambda_{i,j}=\\\\lambda_{j,i} for the damping coefficients \\\\lambda. The dependence d\\\\lambda_{i,j}/dA_j of \\\\lambda on A is negligible in most cases. The symbol \\\\mathcal{H}=-\\\\ln\\\\left(p_0\\\\right) denotes the Hamiltonian of the system, where p_0\\\\left(A\\\\right) is the equilibrium probability distribution of the variables A. Finally, [A_i,A_j] is the projection of the Poisson bracket of the slow variables A_i and A_j onto the space of slow variables. In the Brownian motion case one would have \\\\mathcal{H}=\\\\mathbf{p}^2/\\\\left(2mk_BT\\\\right), A=\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\\\\\} or A=\\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{p}\\\\\\\\} and [x_i, p_j]=\\\\delta_{i,j}. The equation of motion d\\\\mathbf{x}/dt=\\\\mathbf{p}/m for \\\\mathbf{x} is exact, there is no fluctuating force \\\\eta_x and no damping coefficient \\\\lambda_{x,p}.  Examples =Trajectories of free Brownian particles= Consider a free particle of mass m with equation of motion described by : m \\\\frac{d \\\\mathbf{v}}{dt} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{v}}{\\\\mu} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(t), where \\\\mathbf{v} = d\\\\mathbf{r}/dt is the particle velocity, \\\\mu is the particle mobility, and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(t) = m \\\\mathbf{a}(t) is a rapidly fluctuating force whose time-average vanishes over a characteristic timescale t_c of particle collisions, i.e. \\\\overline{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\eta}(t)} = 0.

The colored solid curves denote the mean squared displacements for the corresponding parameter choices. : \\\\begin{align} R_{vv}(t_1,t_2) & \\\\equiv \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v}(t_1) \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{v}(t_2) \\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = v^2(0) e^{-(t_1+t_2)/\\\\tau} + \\\\int_0^{t_1} \\\\int_0^{t_2} R_{aa}(t_1',t_2') e^{-(t_1+t_2-t_1'-t_2')/\\\\tau} dt_1' dt_2' \\\\\\\\\\\\ & \\\\simeq v^2(0) e^{-t_2-t_1/\\\\tau} + \\\\bigg[\\\\frac{3k_BT}{m} - v^2(0)\\\\bigg] \\\\Big[e^{-t_2-t_1/\\\\tau} - e^{-(t_1+t_2)/\\\\tau}\\\\Big], \\\\end{align} where we have used the property that the variables \\\\mathbf{a}(t_1') and \\\\mathbf{a}(t_2') become uncorrelated for time separations t_2'-t_1' \\\\gg t_c. Besides, the value of \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\langle v^2 (t) \\\\rangle = \\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} R_{vv}(t,t) is set to be equal to 3k_BT/m such that it obeys the equipartition theorem. Note that if the system is initially at thermal equilibrium already with v^2(0) = 3 k_B T/m, then \\\\langle v^2(t) \\\\rangle = 3 k_B T/m for all t, meaning that the system remains at equilibrium at all times. The velocity \\\\mathbf{v}(t) of the Brownian particle can be integrated to yield its trajectory (assuming it is initially at the origin) : \\\\mathbf{r}(t) = \\\\mathbf{v}(0) \\\\tau \\\\big(1-e^{-t/\\\\tau}\\\\big) + \\\\tau \\\\int_0^t \\\\mathbf{a}(t') \\\\Big[1 - e^{-(t-t')/\\\\tau}\\\\Big] dt'. Hence, the resultant average displacement \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{r}(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\mathbf{v}(0) \\\\tau \\\\big(1-e^{-t/\\\\tau}\\\\big) asymptotes to \\\\mathbf{v}(0) \\\\tau as the system relaxes and randomness takes over. In addition, the mean squared displacement can be determined similarly to the preceding calculation to be : \\\\langle r^2(t) \\\\rangle = v^2(0) \\\\tau^2 \\\\big(1 - e^{-t/\\\\tau}\\\\big)^2 - \\\\frac{3k_BT}{m} \\\\tau^2 \\\\big(1 - e^{-t/\\\\tau}\\\\big) \\\\big(3 - e^{-t/\\\\tau}\\\\big) + \\\\frac{6k_BT}{m} \\\\tau t. It can be seen that \\\\langle r^2(t \\\\ll \\\\tau) \\\\rangle \\\\simeq v^2(0) t^2, indicating that the motion of Brownian particles at timescales much shorter than the relaxation time \\\\tau of the system is (approximately) time-reversal invariant. On the other hand, \\\\langle r^2(t \\\\gg \\\\tau) \\\\rangle \\\\simeq 6 k_B T \\\\tau t/m = 6 \\\\mu k_B T t = 6Dt, which suggests that the long-term random motion of Brownian particles is an irreversible dissipative process. Here we have made use of the Einstein‚ÄìSmoluchowski relation D = {\\\\mu \\\\, k_B T} , where D is the diffusion coefficient of the fluid. This plot corresponds to solutions of the complete Langevin equation obtained using the Euler‚ÄìMaruyama method. The left panel shows the time evolution of the phase portrait of a harmonic oscillator at different temperatures. The right panel captures the corresponding equilibrium probability distributions. At zero temperature, the velocity rapidly decays from its initial value (the red dot) to zero due to damping. For nonzero temperatures, the velocity can be kicked to values higher than the initial value due to thermal fluctuations. At long times, the velocity remains nonzero, and the position and velocity distributions correspond to that of thermal equilibrium. = Harmonic oscillator in a fluid = : m\\\\frac{dv}{dt}=-\\\\lambda v+\\\\eta (t)-k x A particle in a fluid is also described by the Langevin equation with a potential, a damping force and thermal fluctuations given by the fluctuation dissipation theorem. If the potential is a harmonic oscillator potential then the constant energy curves are ellipses as shown in Figure 1 below. However, in the presence of a dissipation force a particle keeps losing energy to the environment. On the other hand, the thermal fluctuation randomly adds energy to the particle. In the absence of the thermal fluctuations the particle continuously loses kinetic energy and the phase portrait of the time evolution of the velocity vs. position looks like an ellipse that is spiraling in until it reaches zero velocity. Conversely, the thermal fluctuations provide kicks to the particles that do not allow the particle to lose all its energy. So, at long times, the initial ensemble of stochastic oscillators to spread out, eventually reaching thermal equilibrium, for whom the distribution of velocity and position is given by the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. In the plot below (Figure 2), the long time velocity distribution (orange) and position distributions (blue) in a harmonic potential ( U=\\\\frac{1}{2}k x^{2} ) is plotted with the Boltzmann probabilities for velocity (red) and position (green). We see that the late time behavior depicts thermal equilibrium. Figure 1: Phase portrait of a harmonic oscillator showing spreading due to the Langevin Equation. Figure 2 : Equilibrium probability for Langevin dynamics in Harmonic Potential An electric circuit consisting of a resistor and a capacitor. = Thermal noise in an electrical resistor = There is a close analogy between the paradigmatic Brownian particle discussed above and Johnson noise, the electric voltage generated by thermal fluctuations in every resistor. The diagram at the right shows an electric circuit consisting of a resistance R and a capacitance C. The slow variable is the voltage U between the ends of the resistor. The Hamiltonian reads \\\\mathcal{H}=E/k_BT=CU^2/(2k_BT), and the Langevin equation becomes :\\\\frac{dU}{dt} =-\\\\frac{U}{RC}+\\\\eta \\\\left( t\\\\right),\\\\;\\\\; \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\eta \\\\left( t\\\\right) \\\\eta \\\\left( t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\frac{2k_{B}T}{RC^{2}}\\\\delta \\\\left(t-t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right). This equation may be used to determine the correlation function :\\\\left\\\\langle U\\\\left(t\\\\right) U\\\\left(t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right) \\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\left( k_{B}T/C\\\\right) \\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\left\\\\vert t-t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right\\\\vert /RC\\\\right) \\\\approx 2Rk_{B}T\\\\delta \\\\left( t-t^{\\\\prime }\\\\right), which becomes a white noise (Johnson noise) when the capacitance C becomes negligibly small. = Critical dynamics = The dynamics of the order parameter \\\\varphi of a second order phase transition slows down near the critical point and can be described with a Langevin equation. The simplest case is the universality class \\"model A\\" with a non-conserved scalar order parameter, realized for instance in axial ferromagnets, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x},t\\\\right)}{\\\\partial t}&=-\\\\lambda\\\\frac{\\\\delta\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\delta\\\\varphi}+\\\\eta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x},t\\\\right),\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{H}&=\\\\int d^{d}x\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\varphi\\\\left[r_{0}- abla^{2}\\\\right]\\\\varphi+u\\\\varphi^{4}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} ,\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left\\\\langle \\\\eta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x},t\\\\right)\\\\eta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}',t'\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\rangle &=2\\\\lambda\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}'\\\\right)\\\\delta\\\\left(t-t'\\\\right). \\\\end{align} Other universality classes (the nomenclature is \\"model A\\",..., \\"model J\\") contain a diffusing order parameter, order parameters with several components, other critical variables and/or contributions from Poisson brackets. = Recovering Boltzmann statistics = Langevin equations must reproduce the Boltzmann distribution. 1-dimensional overdamped Brownian motion is an instructive example. The overdamped case is realized when the inertia of the particle is negligible in comparison to the damping force. The trajectory x(t) of the particle in a potential V(x) is described by the Langevin equation : \\\\lambda \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial V(x)}{\\\\partial x} + \\\\eta(t), where the noise is characterized by \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\eta(t) \\\\eta(t')\\\\right\\\\rangle = 2 k_B T \\\\lambda \\\\delta(t-t') and \\\\lambda is the damping constant. We would like to compute the distribution p(x) of the particle's position in the course of time. A direct way to determine this distribution is to introduce a test function f, and to look at the average of this function over all realizations (ensemble average) : \\\\lambda\\\\frac{d \\\\left\\\\langle f(x(t))\\\\right\\\\rangle}{d t} = \\\\left\\\\langle f'(x(t))\\\\lambda\\\\frac{dx}{dt} \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle -f'(x(t))\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} + f'(x(t))\\\\eta(t) \\\\right\\\\rangle. If x(t) remains finite then this quantity is null. Moreover, using the Stratonovich interpretation, we are able to get rid of the eta in the second term so that we end up with : \\\\left\\\\langle -f'(x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} + k_B T f(x) \\\\right\\\\rangle=0, where we make use of the probability density function p(x). This is done by explicitly computing the average, : \\\\int \\\\left( -f'(x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x}p(x) + {k_B T} f(x)p(x) \\\\right) dx = \\\\int \\\\left( -f'(x)\\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} p(x) - {k_B T} f'(x)p'(x) \\\\right) dx = 0, where the second term was integrated by parts (hence the negative sign). Since this is true for arbitrary functions f, we must have: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial V}{\\\\partial x} p(x) + {k_B T} p'(x) = 0, thus recovering the Boltzmann distribution : p(x) \\\\propto\\\\exp \\\\left( {-\\\\frac{ V(x)}{k_B T}}\\\\right).  Equivalent techniques  A solution of a Langevin equation for a particular realization of the fluctuating force is of no interest by itself; what is of interest are correlation functions of the slow variables after averaging over the fluctuating force. Such correlation functions also may be determined with other (equivalent) techniques. = Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation = A Fokker-Planck equation is a deterministic equation for the time dependent probability density P\\\\left(A,t\\\\right) of stochastic variables A. The Fokker- Planck equation corresponding to the generic Langevin equation above may be derived with standard techniques (see for instance ref.), : \\\\frac{\\\\partial P\\\\left(A,t\\\\right)}{\\\\partial t}=\\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial A_{i}}\\\\left(-k_{B}T\\\\left[A_{i},A_{j}\\\\right]\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\partial A_{j}}+\\\\lambda_{i,j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\mathcal{H}}{\\\\partial A_{j}}+\\\\lambda_{i,j}\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial A_{j}}\\\\right)P\\\\left(A,t\\\\right). The equilibrium distribution P(A) = p_0(A) = \\\\text{const}\\\\times\\\\exp(-\\\\mathcal{H}) is a stationary solution. = Path integral = A path integral equivalent to a Langevin equation may be obtained from the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation or by transforming the Gaussian probability distribution P^{(\\\\eta)}(\\\\eta)d\\\\eta of the fluctuating force \\\\eta to a probability distribution of the slow variables, schematically P(A)dA = P^{(\\\\eta)}(\\\\eta(A))\\\\det(d\\\\eta/dA)dA. The functional determinant and associated mathematical subtleties drop out if the Langevin equation is discretized in the natural (causal) way, where A(t+\\\\Delta t)-A(t) depends on A(t) but not on A(t+\\\\Delta t). It turns out to be convenient to introduce auxiliary response variables \\\\tilde A. The path integral equivalent to the generic Langevin equation then reads :\\\\int P(A,\\\\tilde{A})\\\\,dA\\\\,d\\\\tilde{A} = N\\\\int \\\\exp \\\\left( L(A,\\\\tilde{A})\\\\right) dA\\\\,d\\\\tilde{A}, where N is a normalization factor and : L(A,\\\\tilde{A}) = \\\\int \\\\sum_{i,j}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\tilde{A}_{i}\\\\lambda_{i,j}\\\\tilde{A}_{j}-\\\\widetilde{A}_{i}\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\delta_{i,j}\\\\frac{dA_{j}}{dt}-k_{B}T\\\\left[A_{i},A_{j}\\\\right]\\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{H}}{dA_{j}}+\\\\lambda_{i,j}\\\\frac{d\\\\mathcal{H}}{dA_{j}}-\\\\frac{d\\\\lambda_{i,j}}{dA_{j}}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} dt. The path integral formulation doesn't add anything new, but it does allow for the use of tools from quantum field theory; for example perturbation and renormalization group methods (if these make sense).

Approximations  For moderate sound levels and young listeners, the bandwidth of human auditory filters can be approximated by the polynomial equation: where f is the center frequency of the filter in kHz and ERB(f) is the bandwidth of the filter in Hz. The approximation is based on the results of a number of published simultaneous masking experiments and is valid from 0.1 to 6.5 kHz.B.C.J. Moore and B.R. Glasberg, \\"Suggested formulae for calculating auditory-filter bandwidths and excitation patterns\\" Journal of the Acoustical Society of America 74: 750-753, 1983. The above approximation was given in 1983 by Moore and Glasberg, who in 1990 published another (linear) approximation:B.R. Glasberg and B.C.J.

The approximation is applicable at moderate sound levels and for values of f between 0.1 and 10 kHz.  ERB-rate scale The ERB-rate scale, or ERB-number scale, can be defined as a function ERBS(f) which returns the number of equivalent rectangular bandwidths below the given frequency f.

It was one of the last of the canals designed by James Brindley, who died while it was being constructed. It was opened in 1777 and ran for from the River Trent at West Stockwith, Nottinghamshire to Chesterfield, Derbyshire, passing through the Norwood Tunnel at Kiveton Park, at the time one of the longest tunnels on the British canal system. The canal was built to export coal, limestone, and lead from Derbyshire, iron from Chesterfield, and corn, deals, timber, groceries and general merchandise into Derbyshire. The stone for the Palace of Westminster was quarried in North Anston, Rotherham, and transported via the canal. It was reasonably profitable, paying dividends from 1789, and with the coming of the railways, some of the proprietors formed a railway company. It became part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway company, and although there were intermittent plans to convert parts of it to a railway, it continued to thrive as a canal. In 1907, subsidence from local coal mines caused the collapse of the Norwood Tunnel, and the canal was effectively split in two. Subsequently, the main use of the Chesterfield end was the supply of water to the iron industry, while commercial carrying continued on the Worksop to West Stockwith section until the late 1950s. It was formally closed in 1961, but campaigners fought for it to be retained, and the Worksop to Stockwith section was designated as a \\"cruiseway\\" under the Transport Act 1968, meaning that it would be retained for leisure use. The rest was designated as a remainder waterway, and parts were sold off, with housing being built over the route through Killamarsh. The Chesterfield Canal Society was formed in 1978 to spearhead restoration, becoming the Chesterfield Canal Trust in 1997. They initially sought to extend the navigable section beyond Worksop, but when progress was slow, moved to working on the Chesterfield end. Over of canal, including five original locks and a brand new lock at Staveley Basin were navigable by 2017. The eastern end was restored from Worksop to the mouth of the Norwood Tunnel at Kiveton Park near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, between 1995 and 2003, funded by Derelict Land Grants, English Partnerships and the Heritage Lottery Fund. Less than of the original route remain to be restored to link the two navigable sections, but this will require some new lengths of canal to be built, to bypass the housing development at Killamarsh, and to replace most of the Norwood Tunnel, which cannot be restored. The eastern section is managed by the Canal and River Trust, while the western section is managed by Derbyshire County Council. It includes Tapton Lock Visitor Centre, located to the north of Tapton Park, and the Hollingwood Hub, which provides offices for the Trust, together with meeting rooms and a cafe. It is located by Hollingwood Lock, and consists of a large new extension on the back of the refurbished lock house. History A section of the canal undergoing restoration Lead had been mined in Derbyshire on a commercial scale since at least 1300, but the industry was hampered by poor transport links. The pigs of lead were carried by pack horses to Bawtry, where there were wharves on the River Idle. Small boats carried them to the River Trent, where the cargo was transferred to larger vessels for onward distribution. There was no proper system of road maintenance, and so the use of carts and wagons for the over- land journey was not possible. The River Idle was also unreliable, being affected by floods and droughts, but there were no alternatives, and the industry flourished despite the difficulties. The Derwent Navigation was authorised in 1719, running from Derby to the River Trent, but it was less reliable than the Idle, and so did not seriously affect trade through Bawtry. The London Lead Company, one of the main traders, together with others involved in lead and coal mining, looked for possible solutions, and were joined in this by several prominent landowners. The main impetus for a canal came from the owners of mineral rights. The London Lead Company met with the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Newcastle, and others, but proposals were actively supported by the towns of Chesterfield, Worksop and Retford. Retford had obtained an Act of Parliament in 1720 to improve the River Idle from Bawtry to the town, but very little work was done to implement the scheme. In addition to being a market town, Retford also manufactured bricks and tiles, had reserves of gravel, and produced an agricultural surplus. In 1769, a steering group produced a pamphlet extolling the advantages of a proposed canal, which was available to everyone, but was primarily addressed to the Duke of Newcastle, Lord George Augustus Cavendish, and the MP for Derbyshire, Godfrey Bagnall Clarke. The Chesterfield canal surveyed in 1769. Published in the Gentleman's Magazine in 1777. The route of the canal was surveyed by James Brindley and John Varley, who estimated the cost at ¬£94,908 17s. Brindley presented his proposals to a meeting in Worksop on 24 August 1769. Bawtry interests asked John Grundy to carry out a second survey. He proposed a rather shorter course, from Stockwith in a straight line to Bawtry and then by Scrooby, Blyth and Carlton, to join Brindley's line at Shireoaks. Grundy's line was shorter, and the cost estimated at ¬£71,479 6s d. Although Grundy's line was considerably cheaper, it achieved this by missing Worksop and Retford, and the investors had already decided in favour of Brindley's route. An application was made to Parliament and the Act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 28 March 1771, entitled An Act for making a navigable Cut or Canal from Chesterfield, in the county of Derby, through or near Worksop and Retford, to join the River Trent, at or near Stockwith, in the county of Nottingham. The promoters consisted of one hundred and seventy-four persons, amongst whom were the Duke of Devonshire, the Duke of Newcastle, Lord Scarsdale, the Dean of York, and Sir Cecil Wray. They were incorporated by the name of The Company of Proprietors of the Canal Navigation from Chesterfield to the River Trent, and empowered to raise among themselves the sum of ¬£100,000, in one thousand shares of ¬£100 each, to fund the construction. Immediately on the passing of the act, construction began under the direction of Brindley. Upon his death in September 1772, John Varley moved from Clerk of Works to Resident Engineer with Hugh Henshall, Brindley's brother-in-law, appointed in a consultative capacity. He agreed to make inspections every three months. Henshall became Chief Engineer in 1773 and John Varley continued to work on the project. By August 1773, the section between Shireoaks and Worksop was nearly complete, and the company created a works to build boats at Shireoaks. The boats were used to carry spoil from the construction, and also to deliver coal. The canal was effectively open from Shireoaks to below Worksop by 6 April 1774, and to Retford by 3 August. The price of coal to the residents of Retford dropped from 15s 6d (77.5p) to 10s 6d (52.5p) overnight. Hayton was reached on 22 February 1775, and the Norwood Tunnel opened on 9 May 1775. The canal was to be built as a narrow canal, but in 1775, nine shareholders offered to fund the extra cost of making it a broad canal from Retford to Stockwith. Retford Corporation joined them, and each contributed ¬£500, although the additional cost exceeded the ¬£6,000 subscribed. The canal was opened throughout on 4 June 1777, with the lock into the River Trent at West Stockwith completed in the autumn, but the only record of wide-beamed boats using it at Retford is prior to 1799.Stamford Mercury 12 July 1799, column 3. =Operation= As built, the canal was almost long, being from the Trent to Worksop with a rise of . From Worksop to the eastern portal of Norwood Tunnel it was with a further rise. From there to Chesterfield it was a further with a fall of followed by a rise of . There were 65 locks in all, with two tunnels: a short tunnel near Gringley Beacon,Chesterfield Canal map and elevations, Chesterfield Canal Society and the major long Norwood Tunnel. At the time of construction, Norwood Tunnel was the second longest canal tunnel in Britain, exceeded only by another of Brindley's tunnels, that at Harecastle on the Trent and Mersey Canal. The canal was a typical Brindley contour canal, following the contours to avoid costly cuttings and embankments, which resulted in a less than direct route in places. In late 1775, the company had decided to build a branch, which left the canal between Renishaw and Staveley, and ran generally southwards for about to the turnpike road at Norbriggs. This may have been to help with transport to Chesterfield, until the main line was completed, but in 1777, the company leased Norbriggs Colliery. Henshall supervised its operation, and transport of coal to the branch canal was improved by the provision of a \\"Newcastle Rail Road\\" in 1778, which used wooden rails. The company pulled out of running the mine in 1797, when they advertised it to be let. Water supply was initially by a reservoir at Pebley, which was later supplemented by reservoirs at Harthill, Woodall and Killamarsh. Near Worksop, a private branch was built to serve the Lady Lee quarry, which ran for about , while at Netherthorpe, a branch connected to the East Inkersall tramroad, which served pits near the Adelphi Canal. A gasworks was later built at the junction, and while the 1877 Ordnance survey map shows a short stub of the branch, connecting to the Seymour and Speedwell Branch railway, by 1898 a railway siding had replaced it, leaving just a basin at the junction to serve the gasworks.Ordnance Survey, 1:2,500 map, 1877 and 1898 Another private branch was built in 1840, which crossed the Norbriggs road at Netherthorpe to serve the Speedwell Colliery. It was built by the Barrows, who also owned Staveley ironworks, but by 1860 had been replaced by a railway. By 1789, the company had spent a total of ¬£152,400, raised through shares and by mortgages. Income for the year was ¬£8,320, and after interest payments had been met, that left a net profit of ¬£2,780, enabling them to make their first dividend payment of one per cent. 74,312 tons of traffic were carried that year, of which 42,380 tons were coal, with the rest consisting of lead, iron, stone, corn, lime, timber and sundries. Dividends had risen to five per cent by 1795, were eight per cent the following year, and were six or seven percent until at least 1836. There were several suggestions for links to the River Don Navigation or the Sheffield Canal, the first in 1792 as part of the scheme to build a canal to Sheffield, and subsequently in 1824, as part of the Grand Commercial Canal, and in 1852, when a Sheffield and Chesterfield Junction Canal was proposed, but none of them moved past the planning stage. =Railway age= In the 1840s, Railway Mania was gripping the country, with many speculative schemes being proposed. Rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed, a number of the proprietors formed the Manchester & Lincoln Union Railway company in October 1845. The intention was to build a line from Liverpool to Grimsby, and to convert part of the canal into a railway. Locally, this included a line from Staveley to Gainsborough, via Worksop, with a branch to Lincoln and another from Worksop to Beighton. The previous year, the Sheffield & Lincolnshire Junction Railway had been proposed, to build a line from Sheffield to Gainsborough, and was supported by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne & Manchester Railway. The new scheme was in direct competition to the earlier one, but the two sets of proprietors met and agreed to amalgamate. Now arguing from a position of strength, the Manchester & Lincoln Union rescinded their plans for most of their lines, and obtained an Act of Parliament on 7 August 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the Midland Railway at Staveley to the canal at Worksop. The new company amalgamated with the Chesterfield Canal, to become the rather unwieldy Manchester & Lincoln Union Railway & Chesterfield & Gainsborough Canal, with powers to further amalgamate with the Sheffield & Lincolnshire Junction Railway. However, by the time they announced this, the Sheffield & Lincolnshire Junction Railway had already become part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, and so they amalgamated with that company instead. The Act of Parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved, the entire canal was to be retained, its water supplies maintained, and tolls were to be fixed at a just level. Under the new regime, the canal was put back into good order in 1848, after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected. The benefits were immediate, with traffic increasing as a result. Over 200,000 tons were carried in 1848, the highest recorded total. The railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal, and to maintain water levels, the reservoirs at Chesterfield were enlarged in 1856. Traffic levels were holding up in 1858, despite fierce competition from the London and North Western Railway. However, the owners considered options for converting the canal from Kiverton Park to Chesterfield into a railway in 1872, 1873 and 1884, but on each occasion, the plans were shelved. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway was expanding, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1889, which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting Chesterfield, Staveley and Beighton to be constructed. The new route was straighter than the old, and reduced the length of the canal by around . The Beighton to Staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 December 1891, and reached Chesterfield on 4 June 1892. The railway's carrying business on this and other canals ceased shortly afterwards. The original route of the canal at Hague Lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and Renishaw Central station, but further north, the section around Chapel Wheel Forge and Dam is still clearly visible, and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds. Close to Bluebank Lock, the railway, known as the Great Central Railway Chesterfield Loop, turned to the east and passed to the south of Staveley Iron Works to reach Staveley Town station. Prior to construction of this section, the canal looped to the north around the iron works, passing through Cinderhill Lock before turning south-eastwards. The canal was re-routed along the southern edge of the works, and the railway crossed over at Staveley Works station, almost on top of a new lock which was known as Staveley Works Lock or Hollingwood Lock. Parts of the canal above Worksop were affected by subsidence from local coal mines. By 1905, traffic had dropped to 45,177 tons, of which around 15,000 tons were coal and 11,000 were bricks. Some 40 boats were still working on the canal, although a short section between Staveley and Chesterfield had become unnavigable. The canal was making a loss, with receipts of ¬£1,837 and expenditure of ¬£3,883 in 1905. The largest drain on resources was the Norwood Tunnel, where ¬£21,000 had been spent since 1871, in an attempt to repair damage and raise the roof. However, on 18 October 1907 there was a further substantial collapse, and the tunnel was closed. Effectively, the canal above Worksop became redundant. Responsibility for the canal passed the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923, who carried out regular maintenance, and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting West Stockwith basin to the River Trent between 1923 and 1925. Various attempts to reduce the growth of weed, which had first appeared on the canal in 1852, were made, with variable success, and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the Second World War. The last serious commercial traffic on the canal was the carriage of bricks from Walkeringham to West Stockwith, which ended in 1955, although there was a small trade in warp, a fine silt dredged from the Trent at the mouth of the River Idle, and used by the cutlery trade in Sheffield for polishing metal, which lasted into the early 1960s. Parts of the isolated section from the tunnel to Chesterfield were infilled and redeveloped. Restoration The eastern portal of the Norwood Tunnel Following the post-war Labour Government nationalisation of the railways and the canals, the Chesterfield Canal became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission. They were determined to close any canals that were not used to carry freight, and did not see any future in leisure use. By 1961, the canal had been formally closed, all requests to use it for leisure purposes were refused, and there were proposals for official abandonment of its entire length. Much of it was filled with rubbish and stagnant water, but despite this, Cliff Clarke, a self-made businessman from South Yorkshire, mounted a campaign to save it. The British Transport Commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962, although the lockgates from Worksop to Kiveton were removed, and the lock walls bulldozed, on the grounds of public safety. Clarke formed the Retford and Worksop (Chesterfield Canal) Boat Club soon afterwards, and it became a limited company in 1966, to cope with the growing membership. Unofficial work parties were organised, to clear locks and cut back vegetation and weed; they were unofficial because the British Transport Commission would not allow volunteers to work on their property. Such activity became slightly more collaborative when the canal became the responsibility of the British Waterways Board. Government policy changed following the publication of a White Paper entitled British Waterways: Recreation and Amenity in September 1967, and the canal was classified as a cruiseway between the Trent and Morse Lock, Worksop under the Transport Act 1968, meaning that it would be maintained to a navigable standard for leisure use. The rest of the canal was classified as remainder. By 1968, restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the Chesterfield Canal was mentioned in the May edition of the Bulletin, produced for members of the Inland Waterways Association (IWA) by the forerunners of the Waterway Recovery Group. The Chesterfield Canal Society was formed in September 1976, determined to restore the canal beyond Worksop, and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at Worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal, in conjunction with the Worksop and Retford Boat Club. Bassetlaw District Council provided financial backing, and the event was held over four days, coinciding with the Queen's Silver Jubilee. Some 150 boats and over 21,000 people attended, with catering services, theatrical performances and exhibitions held on the Bracebridge showground. The Duke of Devonshire opened the festivities, and the Chesterfield Canal Society was formally launched, with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal, rather than just from boaters. Progress beyond Worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995, when a Derelict Land Grant was obtained by Nottinghamshire County Council, and with additional funding from British Coal, a ¬£4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between Worksop and the aqueduct over the River Ryton which forms the county boundary. Rotherham Borough Council were hoping to obtain similar grants for the section between the aqueduct and the Norwood Tunnel, but the funding came from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the regeneration agency English Partnerships. The complete project cost ¬£19 million, which included an extra ¬£971,000 received from the Heritage Lottery Fund, to allow detailed archaeological investigation of the Thorpe and Turnerwood lock flights to be undertaken. On 18 November 2002, the first boats in over 70 years ascended the Turnerwood flight. Thirty locks had been restored, from Morse Lock (49) near Worksop to Thorpe Top Treble Lock (20) near Thorpe Salvin. Three bridges had been rebuilt with navigable headroom, one over Tylden Road, the main access road into Rhodesia, an adjacent one that provided access to nearby cottages, and one which carried Shireoaks Common over the canal near to Shireoaks railway station. Just before Ryton Aqueduct, a new shallow lock named Boundary Lock (41a) had been required, due to widespread subsidence affecting the ground levels, and at Shireoaks, the former colliery loading basin had been turned into a marina. =Western section= Mill Green Bridge was the head of navigation of the western section prior to the opening of Staveley Basin in early 2012. Restoration had focussed initially on the route east from Norwood Tunnel to Worksop, which presented relatively few physical obstacles to being restored to navigation. However, in practice progress had been slow, and attention turned to the section west of Norwood Tunnel, where much more damage had been done to the canal bed, with it being filled in and built over in many places. This included the construction of housing at Killamarsh in the 1970s, which went ahead despite protests. However, parts of the channel had survived remarkably well in places, as it had been used to supply water to the iron industry, and maintained by a team with a boat until the 1950s. The last few miles of the canal, from Chesterfield to Staveley, were in reasonable condition, although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access, while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass, which had first been proposed in 1927. Regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988, organised by the Chesterfield Canal Society, and supplemented by volunteers from the Waterway Recovery Group periodically. Tapton lock was the first to be reopened, in 1990. Derbyshire County Council acquired the section of canal between Chesterfield and Staveley and secured derelict land grants to enable dredging and towpath maintenance to take place. A campaign to ensure that once all the coal had been extracted from the opencast mine, the canal would be reinstated was successful. Two lowered bridges had been rebuilt by June 2001, and Cow Lane Bridge followed in May 2002. Four more locks were restored, with the section from Chesterfield being reopened to navigation in 2002. In a separate development, a private owner of a length of the canal near Boiley Farm, Killamarsh, obtained a Derelict Land Grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992. Although used as fishing ponds, the work resulted in a navigable profile being re-established, and a water supply was obtained from a small unnamed brook, which feeds into the southern end of the ponds. An earth bund at the site of the former Gallas footbridge divides the channel into two ponds, and carries a public footpath. In 1997, the Chesterfield Canal Trust was formed, as a limited company with charitable aims, and took over the assets of the Canal Society in 1998. A breach in the canal in March 2007, caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the Tinkersick Brook under the canal, forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above Tapton Lock for about six weeks. Near the site of the former Renishaw Iron Foundry, which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing, a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007‚Äì08. The work included the new Renishaw Foundry footbridge (18a), which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal, and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the Smithy Brook. The development of the site ceased in 2010, when there were issues with ownership of the land. Since then, there have been issues with vandalism, and the lack of a natural water supply has been a continuing problem. Over the winter of 2010‚Äì11, the Canal Trust obtained its first permanent base, when the lock house at Hollingwood Lock was renovated and a large extension added to the rear. The building, which is known as the Hollingwood Hub, was funded by a grant from Community Assets, part of the government's Office for Civil Society, and provides offices for the Trust, a meeting room and a coffee shop. The ecology of the area was improved by the planting of 450 trees, provided by the Woodland Trust, in November 2011. The next big advance was the opening of some of canal beyond Mill Green Bridge, and the construction of a new mooring basin at Staveley, which was completed in early 2012. Funding for the basin was provided by Derbyshire County Council with a grant from the East Midlands Development Agency, and the work which included the reclamation of the surrounding land, won an award from the Institute of Civil Engineers, given jointly to Derbyshire and the contractors NT Killingley. The work was aided by a road-building scheme for a new Staveley Bypass, which enabled two bridges to be raised and a third to be built, all with sufficient clearance for navigation. =North from Staveley= A map of the canal at Staveley in 1898, showing the locations of the Mineral Line bridge and modern basin. Progress beyond Staveley Basin was hampered by a railway bridge. The first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east, and was erected in the 1850s, when the canal arm to Speedwell Colliery was filled in, to be converted to a railway. The Staveley Ironworks railway system was sold to the Midland Railway in the 1870s, who built a replacement line and bridge, to ease the sharpness of the curve. This area has suffered from subsidence, so when the canal was formally abandoned, the twin-track iron bow girder bridge was removed and the canal was filled in. A combination of the subsidence, and the use of a deep ballast base to enable tracks to be carried straight over any new bridge has reduced the available headroom by . The solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound, with a new Staveley Town Lock (5a) immediately to the north of Staveley Basin to lower the level of the canal, and Railway Lock (5b) constructed just beyond the railway bridge. A syphon will maintain the water supply to the canal beyond the dropped pound. Staveley Town Lock was completed just in time for the Inland Waterways Association National Trailboat Festival, which was held at Staveley over the bank holiday weekend in late May 2016. The first boat passed through the lock on 26 May, and it was officially opened on 28 May. However, once the festival was over, a clay bund had been reinstated above the lock by 16 June, and the pound below it drained, in order to allow work to continue on the weir and spillway which carries excess water back to the River Rother. Although the track on the mineral line has been removed, its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot, for the High Speed 2 (HS2) railway project. On 1 October 2017, the Trust received permission from Network Rail to investigate the bridge remains, and the infill was removed over the next few days. =Chesterfield Waterside= A new bridge under construction at Staveley Basin, to carry the A6192 link road to Junction 29A of the M1 over the new canal channel The southern end of the canal in Chesterfield is being redeveloped as part of a ¬£300 million project called Chesterfield Waterside. This will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently derelict land. The project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site, navigation being restored to a length of the river, and a new basin at the southern edge of the site. Funding for the canal work was provided by a grant of ¬£500,000 from the East Midlands Development Agency. The basin was completed and was opened in October 2009, although it remains isolated from the River Rother, to which it will be connected by a lock, while a back-pumping facility will supply it with water. Outline planning permission for the whole site was granted on 15 March 2010. In April 2012, the project was awarded a ¬£2.4 million grant by the Sheffield City Region Local Enterprise Partnership Board. The funding was for the connecting lock and the provision of sewers and access roads, to facilitate the subsequent development of the site. =Closing the gap= With the canal open from West Stockwith to the eastern portal of Norwood Tunnel, and from Chesterfield to Staveley, there were less than left to be restored by 2017. Whereas most of the work so far had involved restoration of the existing channel, this section includes some significant engineering challenges, with completely new construction needed to bypass the housing estate in Killamarsh, built over the original line in the 1970s, and the replacement of Norwood Tunnel with an alternative route. The Chesterfield Canal Partnership, an association of local and regional authorities, including the Chesterfield Canal Trust and other interested parties, have produced detailed plans for all of the work required to reinstate the missing section. In 2004, the engineers Jacobs-Babtie examined six possible routes for the canal through Killamarsh. Of these, two were reasonably feasible, and were named Central Line East and Central Line West. At the time, the eastern route was felt to be the best option, and consultation with residents resulted in that route being included in the North East Derbyshire Local Plan. However, subsequent detailed design suggests that this may no longer be the best route. Redevelopment of the Tarran Bungalows site to the west of the village provided opportunities to reassess the western route, and it has gained support, as it would be more attractive for boaters, allowing them to access the village more readily. This route would also be considerably cheaper to construct that the eastern route. Both routes drop down into Nethermoor Lake, part of the Rother Valley Country Park and will ascend from the far side to regain the original course. It will not be possible to reopen the Norwood Tunnel, as several sections have collapsed, the National Coal Board filled in some sections to stabilise the land above it, and when the M1 motorway was built, the tunnel below it was injection grouted, to ensure there would not be a subsequent collapse. The engineers Arup considered options for this section in 2007, proposing a route running largely on the surface, and crossing the site of the Kiveton Park Colliery, which closed in 1994. It involved an extra six locks at the top of the Norwood flight of 13 locks, passing under the motorway by using a farm underpass, and then descending through another six new locks, to enter the final of the tunnel. However, announcement of the revised route for the HS2 railway has resulted in other options being reconsidered. One is for a short tunnel at the western end, starting at the existing western portal, but heading in a different direction. The tunnel would be some long, passing under the route of HS2 and the M1 motorway, allowing HS2 to be constructed without interfering with navigation. The scheme would save the need to construct six locks, and engineers were assessing the cost of such a scheme in late 2017. In 2012 the UK Government's announcement of the preferred route for the HS2 rail line extension to Leeds indicated that the line would conflict with the planned restoration of the Canal in several places. The Chesterfield Canal Trust campaigned to have the needs of the Canal taken into account during the consultation process. The July 2017 announcement on the phase 2b route to be developed removed blight from the canal route. Features What are often called \\"traditional\\" working narrowboats were the product of the main canal system ‚Äì but the craft that plied the 46 miles between Chesterfield, Retford, and the River Trent were very different. Isolated on the fringes of the inland waterways network there were no outside canal influences to change the design of craft that were adequate for the job they had to do. The cabins were below- decks, and the boatmen always had a home ashore. Short journeys, usually with a crew of two, did not generate colourful decorations of roses-and-castles, nor did engines oust the towing horse, not even as late as the 1950s. None of the original \\"cuckoo\\" boats have survived, although the last one was extensively measured and recorded in 1976, prior to it being broken up. This has enabled the Canal Trust to create a new boat, named the Dawn Rose, which was constructed at Shireoaks Marina using traditional methods. Wood was bought in 2007, and construction started in 2011, with the boat being completed and launched in April 2015. Norwood Tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the Chesterfield Canal with its Western Portal in Norwood, Derbyshire and its Eastern Portal in Kiveton, South Yorkshire. Although a small section of it at the eastern end may be reused as part of the restoration, most of it will remain abandoned, as it has suffered from subsidence, and parts of it have been filled in. Drakeholes Tunnel is a second, shorter tunnel 154 yards long also without a towpath built for the Chesterfield Canal at Drakeholes, Nottinghamshire a location between the Norwood Tunnel and the River Trent. In order to allow it to be navigated by wide-beam boats, it was built wide and high. Most of it was cut through solid sandstone, and so remained unlined until 1983, when some of the rock was found to be eroding. Hollingwood Common Tunnel is a disused navigable coalmine adit which terminated at the Chesterfield Canal near Staveley. This tunnel was long, its water level was lower than that of the canal requiring the transhipment of coal at the terminus. The boats used were loaded underground within the coalmine the tunnel served; these boats were long and wide. Proposals are at early stages for a link north from Killamarsh to the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation along the River Rother, to be called the Rother Link. This would provide a way to reach the Chesterfield Canal without negotiating the tidal River Trent, and would create a new cruising ring, taking in the Rother Link, River Don Navigation, Stainforth and Keadby Canal, River Trent, and Chesterfield Canal. The towpath of the canal has become a long-distance footpath and cycle route, stretching for from Chesterfield to West Stockwith, and is signposted as the \\"Cuckoo Way\\" after the name given to the boats which worked on the canal. Parts of the towpath beside the western section of the route are also part of the Trans Pennine Trail cycle route. The Chesterfield Canal hit international headlines in 1978. While dredging the bottom of the canal to remove rubbish a maintenance team pulled up a large chain which had a wooden plug attached to it. Later that day, it was noticed that a whirlpool had formed and it became evident that the section of the canal between Whitsunday Pie Lock and Retford Town Lock was losing water. Investigation revealed that the plug was an original engineering feature of the canal, having been installed to allow sections to be drained for future maintenance purposes. The water drained (as designed) harmlessly into the nearby river Idle. The Retford event became a national and international story at the time, and was even recorded in Lloyd's List. However, these plugs were a common feature of English canals built at that time and other instances of sudden drainage (both purposeful and accidental) have since been recorded, including emptying of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct on the Llangollen canal.

The chief judge of a district court is the chief district judge (). The ruling of the district court may be appealed to the next level of court, the court of appeal, and the court of appeal's ruling may in turn be appealed to the supreme court, but only in select cases of precedential relevance admitted by the supreme court. Thus the vast majority of court cases are decided on by the district court or the court of appeal. The term tingrett for the district courts was introduced in 2002, replacing the previous terms city court (byrett) and district court (herredsrett). Historically the district courts outside the cities were known as sorenskriveri (office of a sorenskriver), and consisted of a single (chief) district judge and often one or two assistant judges. The district usually included multiple parishes/municipalities, and the district judge was typically the highest state official within his jurisdiction, with an almost all-encompassing area of jurisdiction and an important role in the regional state administration. Criminal cases Since August 1995, all criminal cases which go to court are tried at the district court first. Prior to this, the most serious cases were tried in the Court of appeal (lagmannsrett). Regular trials are usually held before a panel of three judges, one professional and two lay judges. In particularly difficult cases the bench may consist of five judges (two professional and three lay judges). Verdicts and sentences are determined by a majority vote, with the lay judges' votes counting the same as the professional judge. If there is a full confession, and the defendant agrees to it, the trial may be held before a single professional judge who hears the case and determines sentencing. Civil cases The district court is the second tier in most civil cases, the first tier being the conciliation board (forliksr√•d). Certain cases cannot be held at the conciliation board, including family law, patent and trademark issues, cases against the authorities, and cases where an independent complaints committee has issued an opinion. In addition, larger cases where both sides are representad by attorneys, and other cases where extrajudicial mediation have taken place, may bypass the conciliation board and go straight to the district court. The district court also hears appeals from the conciliation board. Civil cases are normally held before a single professional judge, but either side can demand two lay judges be seated as well. In some cases the law demands that there be two lay judges with competence in the subject matter.

In this case the initial condition is a Dirac delta function centered away from zero velocity. Over time the distribution widens due to random impulses. In statistical mechanics, the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is a partial differential equation that describes the time evolution of the probability density function of the velocity of a particle under the influence of drag forces and random forces, as in Brownian motion. The equation can be generalized to other observables as well. It is named after Adriaan Fokker and Max Planck, and is also known as the Kolmogorov forward equation, after Andrey Kolmogorov, who independently discovered the concept in 1931. When applied to particle position distributions, it is better known as the Smoluchowski equation (after Marian Smoluchowski), and in this context it is equivalent to the convection‚Äìdiffusion equation. The case with zero diffusion is known in statistical mechanics as the Liouville equation. The Fokker-Planck equation is obtained from the master equation through Kramers‚ÄìMoyal expansion. The first consistent microscopic derivation of the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation in the single scheme of classical and quantum mechanics was performed by Nikolay Bogoliubov and Nikolay Krylov.N. N.

The Smoluchowski equation is the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation for the probability density function of the particle positions of Brownian particles. One dimension In one spatial dimension x, for an It≈ç process driven by the standard Wiener process W_t and described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) :dX_t = \\\\mu(X_t, t) \\\\,dt + \\\\sigma(X_t, t) \\\\,dW_t with drift \\\\mu(X_t, t) and diffusion coefficient D(X_t, t) = \\\\sigma^2(X_t, t)/2, the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation for the probability density p(x, t) of the random variable X_t is :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} p(x, t) = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left[\\\\mu(x, t) p(x, t)\\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\left[D(x, t) p(x, t)\\\\right]. In the following, use \\\\sigma = \\\\sqrt{2D}. Define the infinitesimal generator \\\\mathcal{L} (the following can be found in Ref.): : \\\\mathcal{L}p(X_t) = \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac1{\\\\Delta t}\\\\left(\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\big[p(X_{t + \\\\Delta t}) \\\\mid X_t = x \\\\big] - p(x)\\\\right). The transition probability \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x'), the probability of going from (t', x') to (t, x), is introduced here; the expectation can be written as : \\\\mathbb{E}(p(X_{t + \\\\Delta t}) \\\\mid X_t = x) = \\\\int p(y) \\\\, \\\\mathbb{P}_{t + \\\\Delta t,t}(y \\\\mid x) \\\\,dy. Now we replace in the definition of \\\\mathcal{L}, multiply by \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') and integrate over dx. The limit is taken on : \\\\int p(y) \\\\int \\\\mathbb{P}_{t + \\\\Delta t, t}(y \\\\mid x)\\\\,\\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx \\\\,dy - \\\\int p(x) \\\\, \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx. Note now that : \\\\int \\\\mathbb{P}_{t + \\\\Delta t, t}(y \\\\mid x) \\\\, \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx = \\\\mathbb{P}_{t + \\\\Delta t, t'}(y \\\\mid x'), which is the Chapman‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem. Changing the dummy variable y to x, one gets : \\\\begin{align} \\\\int p(x) \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\to 0} \\\\frac1{\\\\Delta t} \\\\left( \\\\mathbb{P}_{t + \\\\Delta t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') - \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\right) \\\\,dx, \\\\end{align} which is a time derivative. Finally we arrive to : \\\\int [\\\\mathcal{L}p(x)] \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx = \\\\int p(x) \\\\, \\\\partial_t \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx. From here, the Kolmogorov backward equation can be deduced. If we instead use the adjoint operator of \\\\mathcal{L}, \\\\mathcal{L}^\\\\dagger, defined such that : \\\\int [\\\\mathcal{L}p(x)] \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x') \\\\,dx = \\\\int p(x) [\\\\mathcal{L}^\\\\dagger \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x')] \\\\,dx, then we arrive to the Kolmogorov forward equation, or Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation, which, simplifying the notation p(x, t) = \\\\mathbb{P}_{t, t'}(x \\\\mid x'), in its differential form reads : \\\\mathcal{L}^\\\\dagger p(x, t) = \\\\partial_t p(x, t). Remains the issue of defining explicitly \\\\mathcal{L}. This can be done taking the expectation from the integral form of the It≈ç's lemma: : \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\big(p(X_t)\\\\big) = p(X_0) + \\\\mathbb{E}\\\\left(\\\\int_0^t \\\\left(\\\\partial_t + \\\\mu\\\\partial_x + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2}\\\\partial_x^2 \\\\right) p(X_{t'}) \\\\,dt'\\\\right). The part that depends on dW_t vanished because of the martingale property. Then, for a particle subject to an It≈ç equation, using : \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\mu\\\\partial_x + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2}\\\\partial_x^2, it can be easily calculated, using integration by parts, that : \\\\mathcal{L}^\\\\dagger = -\\\\partial_x(\\\\mu \\\\cdot) + \\\\frac12 \\\\partial_x^2(\\\\sigma^2 \\\\cdot), which bring us to the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation: : \\\\partial_t p(x, t) = -\\\\partial_x \\\\big(\\\\mu(x, t) \\\\cdot p(x, t)\\\\big) + \\\\partial_x^2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma(x, t)^2}{2} \\\\, p(x,t)\\\\right). While the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is used with problems where the initial distribution is known, if the problem is to know the distribution at previous times, the Feynman‚ÄìKac formula can be used, which is a consequence of the Kolmogorov backward equation. The stochastic process defined above in the It≈ç sense can be rewritten within the Stratonovich convention as a Stratonovich SDE: :dX_t = \\\\left[\\\\mu(X_t, t) - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial X_t}D(X_t, t)\\\\right] \\\\,dt + \\\\sqrt{2 D(X_t, t)} \\\\circ dW_t. It includes an added noise-induced drift term due to diffusion gradient effects if the noise is state-dependent. This convention is more often used in physical applications. Indeed, it is well known that any solution to the Stratonovich SDE is a solution to the It≈ç SDE. The zero-drift equation with constant diffusion can be considered as a model of classical Brownian motion: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} p(x, t) = D_0\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\left[p(x, t)\\\\right]. This model has discrete spectrum of solutions if the condition of fixed boundaries is added for \\\\\\\\{0 \\\\leqslant x \\\\leqslant L\\\\\\\\}: :p(0, t) = p(L, t) = 0, :p(x, 0) = p_0(x). It has been shown that in this case an analytical spectrum of solutions allows deriving a local uncertainty relation for the coordinate- velocity phase volume: : \\\\Delta x \\\\, \\\\Delta v \\\\geqslant D_0. Here D_0 is a minimal value of a corresponding diffusion spectrum D_j, while \\\\Delta x and \\\\Delta v represent the uncertainty of coordinate‚Äìvelocity definition.

Here the drift term is zero and the diffusion coefficient is 1/2. Thus the corresponding Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p(x,t)}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\\\\partial x^2}, which is the simplest form of a diffusion equation. If the initial condition is p(x,0) = \\\\delta(x), the solution is : p(x,t) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi t}}e^{-{x^2}/({2t})}. =Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process= The Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process is a process defined as :dX_t = -a X_t dt + \\\\sigma dW_t. with a>0. The corresponding Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p(x,t)}{\\\\partial t} = a \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x}\\\\left(x \\\\,p(x,t)\\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 p(x,t)}{\\\\partial x^2}, The stationary solution (\\\\partial_t p = 0) is :p_{ss}(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{a}{\\\\pi \\\\sigma^2}} e^{-\\\\frac{ax^2}{\\\\sigma^2}}. =Plasma physics= In plasma physics, the distribution function for a particle species s, p_s (\\\\vec{x},\\\\vec{v},t), takes the place of the probability density function. The corresponding Boltzmann equation is given by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p_s}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\vec{v} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{ abla} p_s + \\\\frac{Z_s e}{m_s} \\\\left( \\\\vec{E} + \\\\vec{v} \\\\times \\\\vec{B} \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\vec{ abla}_v p_s = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial v_i} \\\\left(p_s \\\\langle\\\\Delta v_i\\\\rangle\\\\right) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial v_i \\\\, \\\\partial v_j} \\\\left(p_s \\\\langle\\\\Delta v_i \\\\, \\\\Delta v_j\\\\rangle\\\\right), where the third term includes the particle acceleration due to the Lorentz force and the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck term at the right- hand side represents the effects of particle collisions. The quantities \\\\langle\\\\Delta v_i\\\\rangle and \\\\langle\\\\Delta v_i \\\\, \\\\Delta v_j\\\\rangle are the average change in velocity a particle of type s experiences due to collisions with all other particle species in unit time. Expressions for these quantities are given elsewhere. If collisions are ignored, the Boltzmann equation reduces to the Vlasov equation.  Smoluchowski Diffusion Equation  The Smoluchowski Diffusion equation is the Fokker-Planck equation restricted to Brownian particles affected by an external force F(r). \\\\partial_t P(r,t r_0, t_0) = abla \\\\cdot [D ( abla - \\\\beta F(r)) P(r,t r_0, t_0)] Where D is the diffusion constant and \\\\beta=\\\\frac{1}{k_B T}. The importance of this equation is it allows for both the inclusion of the effect of temperature on the system of particles and a spatially dependent diffusion constant. Starting with the Langevin Equation of a Brownian particle in external field F(r), where \\\\gamma is the friction term, \\\\xi is a fluctuating force on the particle, and \\\\sigma is the amplitude of the fluctuation. m\\\\ddot{r} = - \\\\gamma \\\\dot{r} + F(r) + \\\\sigma \\\\xi(t) At equilibrium the frictional force is much greater than the inertial force, \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\gamma \\\\dot{r} \\\\right\\\\vert >> \\\\left\\\\vert m \\\\ddot{r} \\\\right\\\\vert. Therefore the Langevin equation becomes, \\\\gamma \\\\dot{r} = F(r) + \\\\sigma \\\\xi(t) Which generates the following Fokker- Planck equation, \\\\partial_t P(r,tr_0,t_0) = \\\\Bigl( abla^2\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2 \\\\gamma^2} - abla \\\\cdot \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr) P(r,tr_0,t_0) Rearranging the Fokker-Planck equation, \\\\partial_t P(r,tr_0,t_0)= abla \\\\cdot \\\\Bigl( abla D- \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr) P(r,tr_0,t_0) Where D = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2 \\\\gamma^2}. Note, the diffusion coefficient may not necessarily be spatially independent if \\\\sigma or \\\\gamma are spatially dependent. Next, the total number of particles in any particular volume is given by, N_V (t r_0, t_0) = \\\\int\\\\limits_V dr P(r,tr_0,t_0) Therefore, the flux of particles can be determined by taking the time derivative of the number of particles in a given volume, plugging in the Fokker-Planck equation, and then applying Gauss's Theorem. \\\\partial_t N_V (tr_0, t_0) = \\\\int\\\\limits_V dV abla \\\\cdot\\\\Bigl( abla D- \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr) P(r,tr_0, t_0) = \\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\partial V} \\\\vec{da} \\\\cdot j(r,tr_0, t_0) j(r,tr_0, t_0) = \\\\Bigl( abla D- \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr)P(r,tr_0, t_0) In equilibrium, it is assumed that the flux goes to zero. Therefore, Boltzmann statistics can be applied for the probability of a particles location at equilibrium, where F(r) = - abla U(r) is a conservative force and the probability of a particle being in a state r is given as P(r,tr_0, t_0) = \\\\frac{e^{-\\\\beta U(r)}}{Z}. j(r,tr_0, t_0) = \\\\Bigl( abla D- \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr)\\\\frac{e^{-\\\\beta U(r)}}{Z} = 0 \\\\Rightarrow abla D = F(r)(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\gamma} - D \\\\beta) This relation is a realization of the Fluctuation-Dissipation-theorem. Now applying abla \\\\cdot abla to D P(r,tr_0, t_0) and using the Fluctuation-dissipation theorem, abla \\\\cdot abla D P(r,tr_0,t_0) = abla \\\\cdot D abla P(r,tr_0,t_0)+ abla \\\\cdot P(r,tr_0,t_0) abla D = abla \\\\cdot D abla P(r,tr_0,t_0)+ abla \\\\cdot P(r,tr_0,t_0) \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma} - abla \\\\cdot P(r,tr_0,t_0) D \\\\beta F(r) Rearranging, \\\\Rightarrow abla \\\\cdot \\\\Bigl( abla D- \\\\frac{F(r)}{\\\\gamma}\\\\Bigr)P(r,tr_0,t_0)= abla \\\\cdot D( abla-\\\\beta F(r)) P(r,tr_0,t_0) Therefore, the Fokker-Planck equation becomes the Smoluchowski equation, \\\\partial_t P(r,t r_0, t_0) = abla \\\\cdot D ( abla - \\\\beta F(r)) P(r,t r_0, t_0) For an arbitrary force F(r). Computational considerations Brownian motion follows the Langevin equation, which can be solved for many different stochastic forcings with results being averaged (canonical ensemble in molecular dynamics). However, instead of this computationally intensive approach, one can use the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation and consider the probability p(\\\\mathbf{v}, t)\\\\,d\\\\mathbf{v} of the particle having a velocity in the interval (\\\\mathbf{v}, \\\\mathbf{v} + d\\\\mathbf{v}) when it starts its motion with \\\\mathbf{v}_0 at time 0\\\\. Brownian Dynamics simulation for particles in 1-D linear potential compared with the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. = 1-D Linear Potential Example= Theory  Starting with a linear potential of the form U(x) = cx the corresponding Smoluchowski equation becomes, \\\\partial_t P(x,t x_0, t_0) = \\\\partial_x D (\\\\partial_x + \\\\beta c) P(x,t x_0, t_0) Where the diffusion constant, D, is constant over space and time. The boundary conditions are such that the probability vanishes at x \\\\rightarrow \\\\pm \\\\infin with an initial condition of the ensemble of particles starting in the same place, P(x,tx_0,t_0)= \\\\delta (x-x_0) . Defining \\\\tau = D t and b = \\\\beta c and applying the coordinate transformation, y = x +\\\\tau b ,\\\\ \\\\ \\\\ y_0= x_0 + \\\\tau_0 b With P(x, t, x_0, t) = q(y, \\\\tauy_0, \\\\tau_0) the Smoluchowki equation becomes, \\\\partial_t q(y, \\\\tau y_0, \\\\tau_0) =\\\\partial_y^2 q(y, \\\\tau y_0, \\\\tau_0) Which is the free diffusion equation with solution, q(y, \\\\tau y_0, \\\\tau_0)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt {4 \\\\pi (\\\\tau - \\\\tau_0)}} e^{ -\\\\frac{(y-y_0)^2}{4(\\\\tau-\\\\tau_0)} } And after transforming back to the original coordinates, P(x, t x_0, t_0)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4 \\\\pi D (t - t_0)}} \\\\exp {\\\\Bigl[{ -\\\\frac{(x-x_0+ D \\\\beta c(t-t_0))^2}{4D(t-t_0)}} }\\\\Bigr]  Simulation  The simulation on the right was completed using a Brownian dynamics simulation. Starting with a Langevin equation for the system, m\\\\ddot{x} = - \\\\gamma \\\\dot{x} -c + \\\\sigma \\\\xi(t) Where \\\\gamma is the friction term, \\\\xi is a fluctuating force on the particle, and \\\\sigma is the amplitude of the fluctuation. At equilibrium the frictional force is much greater than the inertial force, \\\\left\\\\vert \\\\gamma \\\\dot{x} \\\\right\\\\vert >> \\\\left\\\\vert m \\\\ddot{x} \\\\right\\\\vert. Therefore the Langevin equation becomes, \\\\gamma \\\\dot{x} = -c + \\\\sigma \\\\xi(t) For the Brownian dynamic simulation the fluctuation force \\\\xi(t) is assumed to be Gaussian with the amplitude being dependent of the temperature of the system \\\\sigma = \\\\sqrt{2\\\\gamma k_B T} . Rewriting the Langevin equation, \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=-D \\\\beta c + \\\\sqrt{2D}\\\\xi(t) Where D=\\\\frac{k_BT}{\\\\gamma} is the Einstein relation. The integration of this equation was done using the Euler- Maruyama method to numerically approximate the path of this Brownian particle. Solution Being a partial differential equation, the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation can be solved analytically only in special cases. A formal analogy of the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation with the Schr√∂dinger equation allows the use of advanced operator techniques known from quantum mechanics for its solution in a number of cases. Furthermore, in the case of overdamped dynamics when the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation contains second partial derivatives with respect to all spatial variables, the equation can be written in the form of a master equation that can easily be solved numerically . In many applications, one is only interested in the steady-state probability distribution p_0(x), which can be found from \\\\frac{\\\\partial p(x,t)}{\\\\partial t}=0. The computation of mean first passage times and splitting probabilities can be reduced to the solution of an ordinary differential equation which is intimately related to the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation. Particular cases with known solution and inversion In mathematical finance for volatility smile modeling of options via local volatility, one has the problem of deriving a diffusion coefficient {\\\\sigma}(\\\\mathbf{X}_t,t) consistent with a probability density obtained from market option quotes. The problem is therefore an inversion of the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation: Given the density f(x,t) of the option underlying X deduced from the option market, one aims at finding the local volatility {\\\\sigma}(\\\\mathbf{X}_t,t) consistent with f. This is an inverse problem that has been solved in general by Dupire (1994, 1997) with a non-parametric solution. Brigo and Mercurio (2002, 2003) propose a solution in parametric form via a particular local volatility {\\\\sigma}(\\\\mathbf{X}_t,t) consistent with a solution of the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation given by a mixture model. More information is available also in Fengler (2008), Gatheral (2008) and Musiela and Rutkowski (2008). Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation and path integral Every Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation is equivalent to a path integral. The path integral formulation is an excellent starting point for the application of field theory methods. This is used, for instance, in critical dynamics. A derivation of the path integral is possible in a similar way as in quantum mechanics. The derivation for a Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation with one variable x is as follows. Start by inserting a delta function and then integrating by parts: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial t}p \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( x^{\\\\prime },t\\\\right) & = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial x'} \\\\left[ D_1(x',t) p(x',t) \\\\right] + \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 }{\\\\partial {x'}^2} \\\\left[ D_2(x',t) p(x',t) \\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx\\\\left( \\\\left[ D_{1}\\\\left( x,t\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial }{\\\\partial x}+D_2 \\\\left( x,t\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right] \\\\delta\\\\left( x^\\\\prime -x\\\\right) \\\\right) p\\\\\\\\!\\\\left( x,t\\\\right). \\\\end{align} The x-derivatives here only act on the \\\\delta-function, not on p(x,t). Integrate over a time interval \\\\varepsilon, :p(x^\\\\prime,t+\\\\varepsilon) =\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\, dx\\\\left(\\\\left( 1+\\\\varepsilon \\\\left[ D_1(x,t) \\\\frac \\\\partial {\\\\partial x} + D_2(x,t) \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2}\\\\right]\\\\right) \\\\delta(x^\\\\prime - x) \\\\right) p(x,t)+O(\\\\varepsilon^2). Insert the Fourier integral :\\\\delta \\\\left( x^\\\\prime -x\\\\right) =\\\\int_{-i\\\\infty}^{i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{d \\\\tilde{x}}{2\\\\pi i}e^{\\\\tilde{x} \\\\left( x-x^\\\\prime\\\\right)} for the \\\\delta- function, : \\\\begin{align} p(x^\\\\prime,t+\\\\varepsilon) & = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx \\\\int_{-i\\\\infty}^{i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{d\\\\tilde{x}}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\left(1+\\\\varepsilon \\\\left[ \\\\tilde{x} D_1(x,t) +\\\\tilde{x}^2 D_2(x,t) \\\\right] \\\\right) e^{\\\\tilde{x} (x-x^\\\\prime)}p(x,t) +O(\\\\varepsilon^2) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[5pt] & =\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty dx \\\\int_{-i\\\\infty}^{i\\\\infty} \\\\frac{d\\\\tilde{x}}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\varepsilon \\\\left[ -\\\\tilde{x}\\\\frac{(x^\\\\prime-x) }\\\\varepsilon + \\\\tilde{x} D_1 f(x,t) +\\\\tilde{x}^2 D_2(x,t) \\\\right] \\\\right) p(x,t) +O(\\\\varepsilon^2). \\\\end{align} This equation expresses p(x^\\\\prime,t+\\\\varepsilon) as functional of p(x,t). Iterating (t^\\\\prime-t)/\\\\varepsilon times and performing the limit \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 gives a path integral with action :S=\\\\int dt\\\\left[ \\\\tilde{x} D_1 (x,t) +\\\\tilde{x}^2 D_2 (x,t) -\\\\tilde{x}\\\\frac{\\\\partial x}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right]. The variables \\\\tilde{x} conjugate to x are called \\"response variables\\". Although formally equivalent, different problems may be solved more easily in the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation or the path integral formulation. The equilibrium distribution for instance may be obtained more directly from the Fokker‚ÄìPlanck equation.

In the mathematical field of knot theory, a knot invariant is a quantity (in a broad sense) defined for each knot which is the same for equivalent knots. The equivalence is often given by ambient isotopy but can be given by homeomorphism. Some invariants are indeed numbers, but invariants can range from the simple, such as a yes/no answer, to those as complex as a homology theory . Research on invariants is not only motivated by the basic problem of distinguishing one knot from another but also to understand fundamental properties of knots and their relations to other branches of mathematics. From the modern perspective, it is natural to define a knot invariant from a knot diagram. Of course, it must be unchanged (that is to say, invariant) under the Reidemeister moves. Tricolorability is a particularly simple example. Other examples are knot polynomials, such as the Jones polynomial, which are currently among the most useful invariants for distinguishing knots from one another, though currently it is not known whether there exists a knot polynomial which distinguishes all knots from each other. However, there are invariants which distinguish the unknot from all other knots, such as Khovanov homology and knot Floer homology. Other invariants can be defined by considering some integer-valued function of knot diagrams and taking its minimum value over all possible diagrams of a given knot. This category includes the crossing number, which is the minimum number of crossings for any diagram of the knot, and the bridge number, which is the minimum number of bridges for any diagram of the knot. Historically, many of the early knot invariants are not defined by first selecting a diagram but defined intrinsically, which can make computing some of these invariants a challenge. For example, knot genus is particularly tricky to compute, but can be effective (for instance, in distinguishing mutants). The complement of a knot itself (as a topological space) is known to be a \\"complete invariant\\" of the knot by the Gordon‚ÄìLuecke theorem in the sense that it distinguishes the given knot from all other knots up to ambient isotopy and mirror image. Some invariants associated with the knot complement include the knot group which is just the fundamental group of the complement. The knot quandle is also a complete invariant in this sense but it is difficult to determine if two quandles are isomorphic. By Mostow‚ÄìPrasad rigidity, the hyperbolic structure on the complement of a hyperbolic link is unique, which means the hyperbolic volume is an invariant for these knots and links. Volume, and other hyperbolic invariants, have proven very effective, utilized in some of the extensive efforts at knot tabulation. In recent years, there has been much interest in homological invariants of knots which categorify well-known invariants. Heegaard Floer homology is a homology theory whose Euler characteristic is the Alexander polynomial of the knot. It has been proven effective in deducing new results about the classical invariants. Along a different line of study, there is a combinatorially defined cohomology theory of knots called Khovanov homology whose Euler characteristic is the Jones polynomial. This has recently been shown to be useful in obtaining bounds on slice genus whose earlier proofs required gauge theory. Mikhail Khovanov and Lev Rozansky have since defined several other related cohomology theories whose Euler characteristics recover other classical invariants. Catharina Stroppel gave a representation theoretic interpretation of Khovanov homology by categorifying quantum group invariants. There is also growing interest from both knot theorists and scientists in understanding \\"physical\\" or geometric properties of knots and relating it to topological invariants and knot type. An old result in this direction is the Fary‚ÄìMilnor theorem states that if the total curvature of a knot in \\\\R^3 satisfies :\\\\oint_K \\\\kappa \\\\,ds \\\\leq 4\\\\pi, where is the curvature at , then is an unknot. Therefore, for knotted curves, :\\\\oint_K \\\\kappa\\\\,ds > 4\\\\pi.\\\\, An example of a \\"physical\\" invariant is ropelength, which is the length of unit-diameter rope needed to realize a particular knot type.

Although his mainstream career only spanned seven years, he is considered to be one of the most iconic and influential musicians in the history of blues music, and one of the greatest guitarists of all time. Born and raised in Dallas, Texas, Vaughan began playing guitar at age seven, initially inspired by his elder brother Jimmie Vaughan. In 1972, he dropped out of high school and moved to Austin, where he began to gain a following after playing gigs on the local club circuit. Vaughan formed the band Double Trouble in 1978 and established it as part of the Austin music scene, which soon became one of the most popular acts in Texas. He performed at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1982 where David Bowie saw him play and contacted him for a studio gig, resulting in Stevie playing his blues guitar on the album Let's Dance (1983) before being discovered by John Hammond, who interested major label Epic Records in signing them to a record deal. Within months, Vaughan achieved mainstream success with Double Trouble for the critically acclaimed debut album Texas Flood. With a series of successful network television appearances and extensive concert tours, he became the leading figure in the blues revival of the 1980s. Playing his guitar behind his back or plucking the strings with his teeth like Jimi Hendrix did, he earned unprecedented stardom in Europe which later resulted in breakthroughs for guitar players like Robert Cray, Jeff Healey, Robben Ford and Walter Trout, amongst others. During the majority of his life, Vaughan struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. He also struggled with the personal and professional pressures of fame, and his marriage to Lenora \\"Lenny\\" Bailey. He successfully completed rehabilitation and began touring again with Double Trouble in November 1986. His fourth and final studio album In Step reached number 33 in the United States in 1989; it was one of Vaughan's most critically and commercially successful releases and included his only number- one hit \\"Crossfire\\". He became one of the world's most highly demanded blues performers, and he headlined Madison Square Garden in 1989 and the Beale Street Music Festival in 1990. On August 27, 1990, Vaughan and four others were killed in a helicopter crash in East Troy, Wisconsin, after performing with Double Trouble at Alpine Valley Music Theatre. An investigation concluded that the cause was pilot error, and Vaughan's family later filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Omniflight Helicopters, which was settled out of court. Vaughan's music continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases and has sold over 15 million albums in the United States alone. In 2003, David Fricke of Rolling Stone ranked him the seventh greatest guitarist of all time. Vaughan was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015, along with Double Trouble bandmates Chris Layton, Tommy Shannon, and Reese Wynans. Family and early life Stevie's grandfather, Thomas Lee Vaughan, married Laura Belle LaRue and moved to Rockwall County, Texas, where they lived by sharecropping. Stevie's father, Jimmie Lee Vaughan, was born on September 6, 1921. Jimmie, also known as Jim and Big Jim, dropped out of school at age sixteen, and enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After his discharge, he married Martha Jean (n√©e Cook; 1928‚Äì2009) on January 13, 1950.: Jim and Martha meeting at a 7-Eleven in the late 1940s; : Jim and Martha married in 1950. They had a son, Jimmie, in 1951. Stephen was born at Methodist Hospital on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas. Big Jim secured a job as an asbestos worker, an occupation that involved rigorous manual effort. The family moved frequently, living in other states such as Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma before ultimately moving to the Oak Cliff section of Dallas. A shy and insecure boy, Vaughan was deeply affected by his childhood experiences. His father struggled with alcohol abuse, and often terrorised his family and friends with his bad temper. In later years, Vaughan recalled that he had been a victim of his father's violence.: Jim's alcohol abuse and temper; : Jim's violence His father died on August 27, 1986, exactly four years before Vaughan himself. =First instruments= In the early 1960s, Vaughan's admiration for his brother Jimmie resulted in him trying different instruments such as the drums and saxophone. In 1961, for his seventh birthday, Vaughan received his first guitar, a toy from Sears with Western motif. Learning by ear, he diligently committed himself, following along to songs by the Nightcaps, particularly \\"Wine, Wine, Wine\\" and \\"Thunderbird\\". He listened to blues artists such as Albert King, Otis Rush, and Muddy Waters, and rock guitarists such as Jimi Hendrix and Lonnie Mack, as well as jazz guitarists including Kenny Burrell. In 1963, he acquired his first electric guitar, a Gibson ES-125T, as a hand- me-down from Jimmie. Soon after he acquired the electric guitar, Vaughan joined his first band, the Chantones, in 1965. Their first gig was at a talent contest held in Dallas' Hill Theatre, but after realizing that they could not perform a Jimmy Reed song in its entirety, Vaughan left the band and joined the Brooklyn Underground, playing professionally at local bars and clubs.: Vaughan's first gig with the Chantones in 1965; : Vaughan joining the Brooklyn Underground in 1967. He received Jimmie's Fender Broadcaster, which he later traded for an Epiphone Riviera. When Jimmie left home at age sixteen, Vaughan's apparent obsession with the instrument caused a lack of support from his parents. Miserable at home, he took a job at a local hamburger stand, where he washed dishes and dumped trash for seventy cents an hour. After falling into a barrel of grease, he grew tired of the job and quit to devote his life to a music career. Music career=Early years= In May 1969, after leaving the Brooklyn Underground, Vaughan joined a band called the Southern Distributor. He had learned the Yardbirds' \\"Jeff's Boogie\\" and played the song at the audition. Mike Steinbach, the group's drummer, commented: \\"The kid was fourteen. We auditioned him on 'Jeff's Boogie,' really fast instrumental guitar, and he played it note for note.\\" Although they played pop rock covers, Vaughan conveyed his interest in the addition of blues songs to the group's repertoire; he was told that he wouldn't earn a living playing blues music and he and the band parted ways.: Vaughan being told that there was no money in blues; : break-up of the Southern Distributor. Later that year, bassist Tommy Shannon walked into a Dallas club and heard Vaughan playing guitar. Fascinated by the skillful playing, which he described as \\"incredible even then\\", Shannon borrowed a bass guitar and the two jammed. Within a few years, they began performing together in a band called Krackerjack. In February 1970, Vaughan joined a band called Liberation, which was a nine-piece group with a horn section. Having spent the past month briefly playing bass with Jimmie in Texas Storm, he had originally auditioned as bassist. Impressed by Vaughan's guitar playing, Scott Phares, the group's original guitarist, modestly became the bassist. In mid-1970, they performed at the Adolphus Hotel in downtown Dallas, where ZZ Top asked them to perform. During Liberation's break, Vaughan jammed with ZZ Top on the Nightcaps song \\"Thunderbird\\". Phares later described the performance: \\"they tore the house down. It was awesome. It was one of those magical evenings. Stevie fit in like a glove on a hand.\\" Attending Justin F. Kimball High School during the early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, including music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved by many of the school's administrators but he was also encouraged by many people, including his art teacher, to strive for a career in art. In his sophomore year, he attended an evening class for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but left when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming. =First recordings= In September 1970, Vaughan made his first studio recordings with the band Cast of Thousands, which included future actor Stephen Tobolowsky. They recorded two songs, \\"Red, White and Blue\\" and \\"I Heard a Voice Last Night\\", for a compilation album, A New Hi, that featured various teenage bands from Dallas. In late January 1971, feeling confined by playing pop hits with Liberation, Vaughan formed his own band, Blackbird. After growing tired of the Dallas music scene, he dropped out of school and moved with the band to Austin, Texas, which had more liberal and tolerant audiences. There, Vaughan initially took residence at the Rolling Hills Club, a local blues venue that would later become the Soap Creek Saloon. Blackbird played at several clubs in Austin and opened shows for bands such as Sugarloaf, Wishbone Ash, and Zephyr, but could not maintain a consistent lineup.: Blackbird opening for Zephyr; : Blackbird opening for Sugarloaf; : Blackbird opening for Wishbone Ash; : Blackbird's inconsistent lineup. In early December 1972, Vaughan left Blackbird and joined Krackerjack; he performed with them for less than three months.: \\"December 2 is the last entry for Blackbird in Charlie Hatchett's booking records until December 30‚Äì31. It would not be surprising if the band had broken up early in the month but had the 30th and New Year's Eve gigs planned well in advance. Stevie probably moved into Krackerjack at this time.\\" In March 1973, Vaughan joined Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers, after meeting Benno at a jam session years before.: Vaughan meets Marc Benno at a jam session; : Vaughan joins Marc Benno's band, the Nightcrawlers. The band featured vocalist Doyle Bramhall, who met Vaughan when he was twelve years old. The next month, the Nightcrawlers recorded an album at Sunset Sound Recorders in Hollywood for A&M; Records. While the album was rejected by A&M;, it included Vaughan's first songwriting efforts, \\"Dirty Pool\\" and \\"Crawlin'\\".: Vaughan's first songwriting efforts; : Nightcrawlers' rejection by A&M; Records. Soon afterward, he and the Nightcrawlers traveled back to Austin without Benno. In mid-1973, they signed a contract with Bill Ham, manager for ZZ Top, and played various gigs across the South, though many of them were disastrous. Ham left the band stranded in Mississippi without any way to make it back home and demanded reimbursement from Vaughan for equipment expenses; Ham was never reimbursed. In 1975, Vaughan joined a six-piece band called Paul Ray and the Cobras which included guitarist Val Swierczewski and saxophonist Joe Sublett. For the next two-and-a-half years, he earned a living performing weekly at a popular venue in town, the Soap Creek Saloon, and ultimately the newly opened Antone's, widely known as Austin's \\"home of the blues\\". In late 1976, Vaughan recorded a single with them, \\"Other Days\\" as the A-side and \\"Texas Clover\\" as the B-side. Playing guitar on both tracks, the single was released on February 7, 1977. In March, readers of the Austin Sun voted them as Band of the Year. In addition to playing with the Cobras, Vaughan jammed with many of his influences at Antone's, including Buddy Guy, Hubert Sumlin, Jimmy Rogers, Lightnin' Hopkins, and Albert King. (primary source); (secondary source) Vaughan toured with the Cobras during much of 1977, but near the end of September, after they decided to strive for a mainstream musical direction, he left the band and formed Triple Threat Revue, which included singer Lou Ann Barton, bassist W. C. Clark, and drummer Fredde Pharaoh. In January 1978, they recorded four songs in Austin, including Vaughan's composition \\"I'm Cryin'\\". The thirty-minute audio recording marks the only known studio recording of the band. =Double Trouble= Double Trouble in 1983. From left to right: Chris Layton, Vaughan and Tommy Shannon. In mid-May 1978, Clark left to form his own group and Vaughan renamed the band Double Trouble, taken from the title of an Otis Rush song. Following the recruitment of bassist Jackie Newhouse, Pharaoh quit in July, and was briefly replaced by Jack Moore, who had moved to Texas from Boston; he performed with the band for about two months. Vaughan then began looking for a drummer and soon after, he met Chris Layton through Sublett, who was his roommate. Layton, who had recently parted ways with Greezy Wheels, was taught by Vaughan to play a shuffle rhythm. When Vaughan offered Layton the position, he agreed. In early July, Vaughan befriended Lenora Bailey, known as \\"Lenny\\", who became his girlfriend, and ultimately his wife. The marriage was to last for six and a half years.: Vaughan befriends Lenny; : marriage to Lenny; : separation from Lenny. In early October 1978, Vaughan and Double Trouble earned a frequent residency performing at one of Austin's most popular nightspots, the Rome Inn. During a performance, Edi Johnson, an accountant at Manor Downs, noticed Vaughan. She remembered: \\"I'm not an authority on music‚Äîit's whatever turned me on‚Äîbut this did.\\" She recommended him to Manor Downs owner Frances Carr and general manager Chesley Millikin, who was interested in managing artists, and saw Vaughan's musical potential. After Barton quit Double Trouble in mid-November 1979, Millikin signed Vaughan to a management contract.: Barton leaves Double Trouble; : Vaughan signs management contract with Millikin. Vaughan also hired Robert \\"Cutter\\" Brandenburg as road manager, whom he had met in 1969.: Vaughan hires Cutter as road manager; : Vaughan meets Cutter. Addressing him as \\"Stevie Ray\\", Brandenburg convinced Vaughan to use his middle name on stage. In October 1980, bassist Tommy Shannon attended a Double Trouble performance at Rockefeller's in Houston. Shannon, who was playing with Alan Haynes at the time, participated in a jam session with Vaughan and Layton halfway through their set. Shannon later commented: \\"I went down there that night, and I'll never forget this: it was like, when I walked in the door and I heard them playing, it was like a revelation. 'That's where I want to be; that's where I belong, right there.' During the break, I went up to Stevie and told him that. I didn't try to sneak around and hide it from the bass player [Jackie Newhouse]‚ÄîI didn't know if he was listening or not. I just really wanted to be in that band. I sat in that night and it sounded great.\\" Almost three months later, when Vaughan offered Shannon the position, he readily accepted. Drug charge and trial On December 5, 1979, while Vaughan was in a dressing room before a performance in Houston, an off-duty police officer arrested him after witnessing his usage of cocaine near an open window. He was formally charged with cocaine possession and subsequently released on $1,000 bail.; Double Trouble was the opening act for Muddy Waters, who said about Vaughan's substance abuse: \\"Stevie could perhaps be the greatest guitar player that ever lived, but he won't live to get 40 years old if he doesn't leave that white powder alone.\\" The following year, he was required to return on January 16 and February 29 for court appearances. During the final court date, on April 17, 1980, Vaughan was sentenced with two years' probation and was prohibited from leaving Texas. Along with a stipulation of entering treatment for drug abuse, he was required to \\"avoid persons or places of known disreputable or harmful character\\"; he refused to comply with both of these orders. After a lawyer was hired, his probation officer had the sentence revised to allow him to work outside of the state. The incident later caused him to refuse maid service while staying in hotels during concert tours. Montreux Jazz Festival Although popular in Texas at the time, Double Trouble failed to gain national attention. The group's luck progressed when record producer Jerry Wexler recommended them to Claude Nobs, organizer of the Montreux Jazz Festival. He insisted the festival's blues night would be great with Vaughan, whom he called \\"a jewel, one of those rarities who comes along once in a lifetime\\", and Nobs agreed to book Double Trouble on July 17. Vaughan opened with a medley arrangement of Freddie King's song \\"Hide Away\\" and his own fast instrumental composition, \\"Rude Mood\\". Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of Larry Davis' \\"Texas Flood\\", Hound Dog Taylor's \\"Give Me Back My Wig\\", and Albert Collins' \\"Collins Shuffle\\", as well as three original compositions: \\"Pride and Joy\\", \\"Love Struck Baby\\", and \\"Dirty Pool\\". The set ended with boos from the audience. People's James McBride wrote: According to road manager Don Opperman: \\"the way I remember it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' were mixed together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [had] just handed me his guitar and walked off stage, and I'm like, 'are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He went back to the dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, and that was the end of the show.\\" According to Vaughan: \\"it wasn't the whole crowd [that booed]. It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow, it sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!\\" (primary source); (secondary source) The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004. On the following night, Double Trouble was booked in the lounge of the Montreux Casino, with Jackson Browne in attendance. Browne jammed with Double Trouble until the early morning hours and offered them free use of his personal recording studio in downtown Los Angeles. In late November the band accepted his offer and recorded ten songs in two days. While they were in the studio, Vaughan received a telephone call from David Bowie, who met him after the Montreux performance, and he invited him to participate in a recording session for his next studio album, Let's Dance. In January 1983, Vaughan recorded guitar on six of the album's eight songs, including the title track and \\"China Girl\\".: Bowie songs that included Vaughan; : recording sessions with Bowie. The album was released on April 14, 1983 and sold over three times as many copies as Bowie's previous album. National success In mid-March 1983, Gregg Geller, vice president of A&R; at Epic Records, signed Double Trouble to the label at the recommendation of record producer John Hammond. Soon afterward, Epic financed a music video for \\"Love Struck Baby\\", which was filmed at the Cherry Tavern in New York City. Vaughan recalled: \\"we changed the name of the place in the video. Four years ago I got married in a club where we used to play all the time called the Rome Inn. When they closed it down, the owner gave me the sign, so in the video we put that up behind me on the stage.\\" With the success of Let's Dance, Bowie requested Vaughan as the featured instrumentalist for the upcoming Serious Moonlight Tour, realizing that he was an essential aspect of the album's groundbreaking success. In late April, Vaughan began rehearsals for the tour in Las Colinas, Texas. When contract renegotiations for his performance fee failed, Vaughan abandoned the tour days before its opening date, and he was replaced by Earl Slick.: Vaughan's contract renegotiations for Serious Moonlight tour; : Vaughan quits the Serious Moonlight tour. Vaughan commented: \\"I couldn't gear everything on something I didn't really care a whole lot about. It was kind of risky, but I really didn't need all the headaches.\\" Although contributing factors were widely disputed, Vaughan soon gained major publicity for quitting the tour. On May 9, the band performed at The Bottom Line in New York City, where they opened for Bryan Adams, with Hammond, Mick Jagger, John McEnroe, Rick Nielsen, Billy Gibbons, and Johnny Winter in attendance. (primary source); (secondary source) Brandenburg described the performance as \\"ungodly\\": \\"I think Stevie played every lick as loud and as hard and with as much intensity as I've ever heard him.\\" The performance earned Vaughan a positive review published in the New York Post, asserting that Double Trouble outperformed Adams. \\"Fortunately, Bryan Adams, the Canadian rocker who is opening arena dates for Journey, doesn't headline too often\\", wrote Martin Porter, who claimed that after the band's performance, the stage had been \\"rendered to cinders by the most explosively original showmanship to grace the New York stage in some time.\\" Texas Flood After acquiring the recordings from Browne's studio, Double Trouble began assembling the material for a full-length LP. The album, Texas Flood, opens with the track \\"Love Struck Baby\\", which was written for Lenny on their \\"love-struck day\\". He composed \\"Pride and Joy\\" and \\"I'm Cryin'\\" for one of his former girlfriends, Lindi Bethel, and are both musically similar, but their lyrics are two different perspectives of their prior relationship.: \\"Now that he is part of the quintuple-headed vox machine known merely as Triple Threat, Stevie begins to write, starting with 'Pride and Joy' and 'I'm Cryin‚Ä≤' for his girlfriend, Lindi Bethel ... of course, the two songs are musical twins, but the lyrics reveal opposite perspectives of their rollercoaster relationship.\\" Along with covers of Howlin' Wolf, the Isley Brothers, and Buddy Guy, the album included Vaughan's cover of Larry Davis' \\"Texas Flood\\", a song which he became strongly associated with. \\"Lenny\\" served as a tribute to his wife, which he composed at the end of their bed. Texas Flood featured cover art by illustrator Brad Holland, who is known for his artwork for Playboy and The New York Times. Originally envisioned with Vaughan sitting on a horse depicting a promotable resemblance, Holland painted an image of him leaning against a wall with a guitar, using a photograph as a reference. Released on June 13, 1983, Texas Flood peaked at number 38 and ultimately sold half a million copies. While Rolling Stone editor Kurt Loder asserted that Vaughan did not possess a distinctive voice, according to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the release was a \\"monumental impact\\".AllMusic, 2014 Billboard described it as \\"a guitar boogie lovers delight\\".Billboard, June 1983 Agent Alex Hodges commented: \\"No one knew how big that record would be, because guitar players weren't necessarily in vogue, except for some that were so established they were undeniable ... he was one of the few artists that was recouped on every record in a short period of time.\\" On June 16, Vaughan gave a performance at Tango nightclub in Dallas, which celebrated the album's release. Assorted VIPs attended the performance, including Ted Nugent, Sammy Hagar, and members of The Kinks and Uriah Heep. Jack Chase, vice president of marketing for Epic, recalled: \\"the coming-out party at Tango was very important; it was absolutely huge. All the radio station personalities, DJs, program directors, all the retail record store owners and the important managers, press, all the executives from New York came down‚Äîabout seven hundred people. We attacked in Dallas first with Q102-FM and [DJ] Redbeard. We had the Tango party‚Äîit was hot. It was the ticket.\\" The Dallas Morning News reviewed the performance, starting with the rhetorical question; \\"what if Stevie Ray Vaughan had an album release party and everybody came? It happened Thursday night at Tango. ... The adrenalin must have been gushing through the musicians' veins as they performed with rare finesse and skill.\\" Following a brief tour in Europe, Hodges arranged an engagement for Double Trouble as The Moody Blues' opening act during a two-month tour of North America. Hodges stated that many people disliked the idea of Double Trouble opening for The Moody Blues, but asserted that a common thread which both bands shared was \\"album-oriented rock\\". Shannon described the tour as \\"glorious\\": \\"Our record hadn't become that successful yet, but we were playing in front of coliseums full of people. We just went out and played, and it fit like a glove. The sound rang through those big coliseums like a monster. People were going crazy, and they had no idea who we were!\\" After appearing on the television series Austin City Limits, the band played a sold-out concert at New York City's Beacon Theatre. Variety wrote that their ninety-minute set at the Beacon \\"left no doubt that this young Texas musician is indeed the 'guitar hero of the present era.'\\" Couldn't Stand the Weather In January 1984, Double Trouble began recording their second studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen.: \\"January: Studio sessions for Couldn't Stand the Weather, nineteen days at New York City's Power Station.\\" Layton later recalled working with Hammond: \\"he was kind of like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person.\\" As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: \\"... we did probably the quietest version we ever did up 'til that point. We ended it and [Hammond] said; 'that's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went; 'we haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'that doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times- I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time.\\"In the Studio, Album Network, 1993, Redbeard (primary source); (secondary source) During recording sessions, Vaughan began experimenting with other combinations of musicians, including Fran Christina and Stan Harrison, who played drums and saxophone respectively on the jazz instrumental, \\"Stang's Swang\\". Jimmie Vaughan played rhythm guitar on his cover of Guitar Slim's \\"The Things That I Used to Do\\" and the title track, the latter of which Vaughan carries a worldly message in his lyrics. According to musicologist Andy Aledort, Vaughan's guitar playing throughout the song is marked by steady rhythmic strumming patterns and improvised lead lines, with a distinctive R&B; and soul single-note riff, doubled in octaves by guitar and bass. Couldn't Stand the Weather was released on May 15, 1984, and two weeks later it had rapidly outpaced the sales of Texas Flood. It peaked at number 31 and spent 38 weeks on the charts. The album includes Vaughan's cover of Jimi Hendrix's song, \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", which provoked inevitable comparisons to Hendrix. According to AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Couldn't Stand the Weather \\"confirmed that the acclaimed debut was no fluke, while matching, if not bettering, the sales of its predecessor, thereby cementing Vaughan's status as a giant of modern blues.\\" According to authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford, the album \\"was a major turning point in Stevie Ray Vaughan's development\\" and Vaughan's singing improved. Carnegie Hall On October 4, 1984, Vaughan headlined a performance at Carnegie Hall that included many guest musicians. For the second half of the concert, he added Jimmie as rhythm guitarist, drummer George Rains, keyboardist Dr. John, Roomful of Blues horn section, and featured vocalist Angela Strehli. The ensemble rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and despite the solid dynamics of Double Trouble for the first half of the performance, according to Patoski and Crawford, the big band concept never entirely took form. Before arriving at the engagement, the venue sold out, which made Vaughan extremely excited and nervous as he did not calm down until halfway through the third song. A benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation's work in leukemia and cancer research, he was an important draw for the event. As his scheduled time slot drew closer, he indicated that he preferred traveling to the venue by limousine to avoid being swarmed by fans on the street; the band took the stage around 8:00 p.m.: Vaughan found taking a limousine to Carnegie Hall necessary; : the band took the stage around 8:00 p.m. The audience of 2,200 people, which included Vaughan's wife, family and friends, transformed the venue into what Stephen Holden of The New York Times described as \\"a whistling, stomping roadhouse\\". Introduced by Hammond as \\"one of the greatest guitar players of all time\\", Vaughan opened with \\"Scuttle Buttin'\\", wearing a custom-made mariachi suit he described as a \\"Mexican tuxedo\\".: \\"one of the greatest guitar players of all time\\"; : Carnegie Hall set list; : \\"... wearing Mexican tuxedos ...\\" Double Trouble went on to perform renditions of the Isley Brothers' \\"Testify\\", The Jimi Hendrix Experience's \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", \\"Tin Pan Alley\\", Elmore James' \\"The Sky Is Crying\\", and W. C. Clark's \\"Cold Shot\\", along with four original compositions including \\"Love Struck Baby\\", \\"Honey Bee\\", \\"Couldn't Stand the Weather\\", and \\"Rude Mood\\". During the second half of the performance, Vaughan performed covers by Larry Davis, Buddy Guy, Guitar Slim, Albert King, Jackie Wilson, and Albert Collins. The set ended with Vaughan performing solo renditions of \\"Lenny\\" and \\"Rude Mood\\". The Dallas Times-Herald wrote of the performance at Carnegie Hall as; \\"was full of stomping feet and swaying bodies, kids in blue jeans hanging off the balconies, dancing bodies that clogged the aisles.\\" The New York Times asserted that, despite the venue's \\"muddy\\" acoustics, their performance was \\"filled with verve\\", and Vaughan's playing was \\"handsomely displayed\\". Jimmie Vaughan later commented: \\"I was worried the crowd might be a little stiff. Turned out they're just like any other beer joint.\\" Vaughan commented: \\"We won't be limited to just the trio, although that doesn't mean we'll stop doing the trio. I'm planning on doing that too. I ain't gonna stay in one place. If I do, I'm stupid.\\" The performance was recorded and later released as an official live LP. The album was released on July 29, 1997 by Epic Records; it was ultimately certified gold. Immediately after the concert, Vaughan attended a private party at a downtown club in New York, which was sponsored by MTV, where he was greeted by an hour's worth of supporters.: \\"After the show, MTV threw a private party for the band, record company and other VIPs.\\"; : \\"After the show MTV threw a party for him at a downtown club ... Inside, Stevie glad-handed an hour's worth of well-wishers ...\\" On the following day, Double Trouble made an appearance at a record store in Greenwich Village, where they signed autographs for fans. In late October 1984, the band toured Australia and New Zealand, which included one of their first appearances on Australian television‚Äîon Hey Hey It's Saturday‚Äîwhere they performed \\"Texas Flood\\", and an interview on Sounds. On November 5 and 9, they played sold-out concerts at the Sydney Opera House. (primary source); (secondary source) Upon returning to the U.S., Double Trouble went on a brief tour in California. Soon afterward, Vaughan and Lenny went to the island of Saint Croix, on the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Caribbean Sea, where they had spent some time vacationing in December. The next month, Double Trouble flew to Japan, where they appeared for five performances, including at K≈çsei Nenkin Kaikan in Osaka. Soul to Soul In March 1985, recording for Double Trouble's third studio album, Soul to Soul, began at the Dallas Sound Lab. As the sessions progressed, Vaughan became increasingly frustrated with his own lack of inspiration. He was also allowed a relaxed pace of recording the album, which contributed to a lack of focus due to excesses in alcohol and other drugs.; Roadie Byron Barr later recalled: \\"the routine was to go to the studio, do dope, and play ping-pong.\\" Vaughan, who found it increasingly difficult to be able to play rhythm guitar parts and sing at the same time, wanted to add another dimension to the band, so he hired keyboardist Reese Wynans to record on the album; he joined the band soon thereafter.: difficulty for Vaughan to play rhythm guitar and sing at the same time; : Wynans added keyboards and soon joined the band. During the album's production, Vaughan appeared at the Houston Astrodome on April 10, 1985, where he performed a slide guitar rendition of the U.S. national anthem, \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\"; his performance was met with booing. Upon leaving the stage, Vaughan acquired an autograph from former player for the New York Yankees, Mickey Mantle. Astrodome publicist Molly Glentzer wrote in the Houston Press: \\"as Vaughan shuffled back behind home plate, he was only lucid enough to know that he wanted Mickey Mantle's autograph. Mantle obliged. 'I never signed a guitar before.' Nobody asked Vaughan for his autograph. I was sure he'd be dead before he hit 30.\\" Critics associated his performance with Jimi Hendrix's rendition at Woodstock in 1969, yet Vaughan disliked this comparison: \\"I heard they even wrote about it in one of the music magazines and they tried to put the two versions side by side. I hate that stuff. His version was great.\\" Released on September 30, 1985, Soul to Soul peaked at number 34 and remained on the Billboard 200 through mid-1986, eventually certified gold.: Soul to Soul released on September 30, 1985; : Soul to Soul peaked at 34 and remained on the charts through mid-1986, eventually turning gold. Critic Jimmy Guterman of Rolling Stone wrote: \\"there's some life left in their blues rock pastiche; it's also possible that they've run out of gas.\\" According to Patoski and Crawford, sales of the album \\"did not match Couldn't Stand the Weather, suggesting Stevie Ray and Double Trouble were plateauing\\". Vaughan commented: \\"as far as what's on there song-wise, I like the album a lot. It meant a lot to us what we went through to get this record. There were a lot of odds and we still stayed strong. We grew a lot with the people in the band and immediate friends around us; we learned a lot and grew a lot closer. That has a lot to do with why it's called [Soul to Soul].\\" Live Alive After touring for nine and a half months, Epic requested a fourth album from Double Trouble as part of their contractual obligation. In July 1986, Vaughan decided that they would record the LP, Live Alive, during three live appearances in Austin and Dallas. On July 17 and 18, the band performed sold-out concerts at the Austin Opera House, and July 19 at the Dallas Starfest.: \\"The Austin shows sold out in minutes, as fans showed their support for their hometown hero.\\"; : Live Alive recording dates. They used recordings of these concerts to assemble the LP, which was produced by Vaughan. Shannon was backstage before the Austin concert and predicted to new manager Alex Hodges that both Vaughan and himself were \\"headed for a brick wall\\". Guitarist Denny Freeman attended the Austin performances; he called the shows a \\"musical mess, because they would go into these chaotic jams with no control. I didn't know what exactly was going on, but I was concerned.\\" Both Layton and Shannon remarked that their work schedule and drugs were causing the band to lose focus. According to Wynans: \\"Things were getting illogical and crazy.\\" The Live Alive album was released on November 17, 1986, and the only official live Double Trouble LP made commercially available during Vaughan's lifetime, though it never appeared on the Billboard 200 chart.; Though many critics claimed that most of the album was overdubbed, engineer Gary Olazabal, who mixed the album, asserted that most of the material was recorded poorly. Vaughan later admitted that it was not one of his better efforts; he recalled: \\"I wasn't in very good shape when we recorded Live Alive. At the time, I didn't realize how bad a shape I was in. There were more fix-it jobs done on the album than I would have liked. Some of the work sounds like [it was] the work of half-dead people. There were some great notes that came out, but I just wasn't in control; nobody was.\\": \\"..better efforts...\\"; : Vaughan quote about Live Alive. Drugs and alcohol In 1960, when Vaughan was six years old, he began stealing his father's drinks. Drawn in by its effects, he started making his own drinks and this resulted in alcohol dependence. He explained: \\"that's when I first started stealing daddy's drinks. Or when my parents were gone, I'd find the bottle and make myself one. I thought it was cool ... thought the kids down the street would think it was cool. That's where it began, and I had been depending on it ever since.\\" According to the authors Joe Nick Patoski and Bill Crawford: \\"In the ensuing twenty-five years, he had worked his way through the Physicians' Desk Reference before finding his poisons of preference‚Äîalcohol and cocaine.\\" While Vaughan asserted that he first experienced the effects of cocaine when a doctor prescribed him a liquid solution of the stimulant as a nasal spray, according to Patoski and Crawford, the earliest that Vaughan is known to have ingested the drug is in 1975, while performing with the Cobras.; Before that, Vaughan had briefly used other drugs such as cannabis, methamphetamine, and Quaaludes, the brand name for methaqualone.; After 1975, he regularly drank whiskey and used cocaine, particularly mixing the two substances together. According to Hopkins, by the time of Double Trouble's European tour in September 1986, \\"his lifestyle of substance abuse had reached a peak, probably better characterized as the bottom of a deep chasm.\\" At the height of Vaughan's substance abuse, he drank of whiskey and used of cocaine each day. Personal assistant Tim Duckworth explained: \\"I would make sure he would eat breakfast instead of waking up drinking every morning, which was probably the worst thing he was doing.\\" According to Vaughan: \\"it got to the point where if I'd try to say \\"hi\\" to somebody, I would just fall apart crying. It was like solid doom.\\" In September 1986, Double Trouble traveled to Denmark for a one-month tour of Europe. During the late night hours of September 28, Vaughan became ill after a performance in Ludwigshafen, Germany, suffering from near-death dehydration, for which he received medical treatment. The incident resulted in his checking into The London Clinic under the care of Dr. Victor Bloom, who warned him that he was a month away from death.; After staying in London for more than a week, he returned to the United States and entered Peachford Hospital in Atlanta, where he spent four weeks in rehabilitation; Stevie checked into rehab in Austin. Live Alive tour thumb In November 1986, following his departure from rehab, Vaughan moved back into his mother's Glenfield Avenue house in Dallas, which is where he had spent much of his childhood. During this time, Double Trouble began rehearsals for the Live Alive tour. Although Vaughan was nervous about performing after achieving sobriety, he received positive reassurance. Wynans later recalled: \\"Stevie was real worried about playing after he'd gotten sober...he didn't know if he had anything left to offer. Once we got back out on the road, he was very inspired and motivated.\\" The tour began on November 23 at Towson State University, which was Vaughan's first performance with Double Trouble after rehab. On December 31, 1986, they played a concert at Atlanta's Fox Theatre, which featured encore performances with Lonnie Mack. As the tour progressed, Vaughan was longing to work on material for his next LP, but in January 1987, he filed for a divorce from Lenny, which restricted him from any projects until the proceedings were finalized. This prevented him from writing and recording songs for almost two years, but Double Trouble wrote the song \\"Crossfire\\" with Bill Carter and Ruth Ellsworth. Layton recalled: \\"we wrote the music, and they had to write the lyrics. We had just gotten together; Stevie was unable to be there at that time. He was in Dallas doing some things, and we just got together and started writing some songs. That was the first one we wrote.\\" On August 6, 1987, Double Trouble appeared at the Austin Aqua Festival, where they played to one of the largest audiences of their career. According to biographer Craig Hopkins, as many as 20,000 people attended the concert. Following a month-long tour as the opening act for Robert Plant in May 1988, which included a concert at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, the band was booked for a European leg, which included 22 performances, and ended in Oulu, Finland on July 17. This would be Vaughan's last concert appearance in Europe. In Step After Vaughan's divorce from Lenora \\"Lenny\\" Darlene Bailey became final, recording for Double Trouble's fourth and final studio album, In Step, began at Kiva Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, working with producer Jim Gaines and co-songwriter Doyle Bramhall.; Initially, he had doubts about his musical and creative abilities after achieving sobriety, but he gained confidence as the sessions progressed. Shannon later recalled: \\"In Step was, for him, a big growing experience. In my opinion, it's our best studio album, and I think he felt that way, too.\\" Bramhall, who had also entered rehab, wrote songs with Vaughan about addiction and redemption. According to Vaughan, the album was titled In Step because \\"I'm finally in step with life, in step with myself, in step with my music.\\" The album's liner notes include the quote; \\"'thank God the elevator's broken,\\" a reference to the twelve-step program proposed by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). After the In Step recording sessions moved to Los Angeles, Vaughan added horn players Joe Sublett and Darrell Leonard, who played saxophone and trumpet respectively on both \\"Crossfire\\" and \\"Love Me Darlin\\". Shortly before the album's production was complete, Vaughan and Double Trouble appeared at a presidential inaugural party in Washington, D.C. for George H. W. Bush. In Step was released on June 13, 1989, and eight months later, it was certified gold. The album was Vaughan's most commercially successful release and his first one to win a Grammy Award.; It peaked at number 33 on the Billboard 200, spending 47 weeks on the chart. In Step included the song, \\"Crossfire\\", which was written by Double Trouble, Bill Carter, and Ruth Ellsworth; it became his only number one hit. The album also included one of his first recordings to feature the use of a Fuzz Face on Vaughan's cover of the Howlin' Wolf song, \\"Love Me Darlin.; In July 1989, Neil Perry, a writer for Sounds magazine, wrote: \\"the album closes with the brow-soothing swoon of 'Riviera Paradise,' a slow, lengthy guitar and piano workout that proves just why Vaughan is to the guitar what Nureyev is to ballet.\\" According to music journalist Robert Christgau, Vaughan was \\"writing blues for AA...he escapes the blues undamaged for the first time in his career.\\" In October 1989, the Boca Raton News described Vaughan's guitar solos as \\"determined, clear-headed and downright stinging\\" and his lyrics as \\"tension-filled allegories\\".  Death  On August 27, 1990, at 12:50 a.m. (CDT), Vaughan and members of Eric Clapton's touring entourage played an all-star encore jam session at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in Alpine Valley Resort in East Troy, Wisconsin. They then left for Midway International Airport in Chicago in a Bell 206B helicopter, the most common way for acts to enter and exit the venue, as there is only one road in and out, heavily used by fans. The helicopter crashed into a nearby ski hill shortly after takeoff. Vaughan and the four others on board‚Äîpilot Jeff Brown, agent Bobby Brooks, bodyguard Nigel Browne, and tour manager Colin Smythe died.https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1990-08-29-9003120729-story.html The helicopter was identified as being owned by Chicago-based company Omniflight Helicopters. Initial reports of the crash inaccurately claimed that Clapton had also been killed. According to findings from an inquest conducted by the coroner's office in Elkhorn, all five victims were killed instantly. The investigation determined the aircraft departed in foggy conditions with visibility reportedly under two miles, according to a local forecast. The National Transportation Safety Board report stated: \\"As the third helicopter was departing, it remained at a lower altitude than the others, and the pilot turned southeasterly toward rising terrain. Subsequently, the helicopter crashed on hilly terrain about three fifths of a mile from the takeoff point.\\" Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records showed that Brown was qualified to fly by instruments in a fixed-wing aircraft, but not in a helicopter. Toxicology tests performed on the victims revealed no traces of drugs or alcohol in their systems. Vaughan's funeral service was held on August 31, 1990, at Laurel Land Cemetery in Dallas, Texas. His wooden casket quickly became adorned with bouquets of flowers. An estimated 3,000 mourners joined a procession led by a white hearse. Among those at the public ceremony were Jeff Healey, Charlie Sexton, ZZ Top, Colin James, Stevie Wonder, Bonnie Raitt and Buddy Guy. Vaughan's grave marker reads: \\"Thank you ... for all the love you passed our way.\\" Musical style Vaughan's music was rooted in blues, rock, and jazz. He was influenced by Jimi Hendrix, Albert King, Lonnie Mack, B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert Collins, Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson, Buddy Guy, Howlin' Wolf, Otis Rush, Guitar Slim, Chuck Berry, and Muddy Waters. According to nightclub owner Clifford Antone, who opened Antone's in 1975, Vaughan jammed with Albert King at Antone's in July 1977 and it almost \\"scared him to death\\", saying that \\"it was the best I've ever saw Albert or the best I ever saw Stevie\\". While Albert King had a substantial influence on Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix was Vaughan's greatest inspiration. Vaughan declared: \\"I love Hendrix for so many reasons. He was so much more than just a blues guitarist‚Äîhe played damn well any kind of guitar he wanted. In fact I'm not sure if he even played the guitar‚Äîhe played music.\\" He was also influenced by such jazz guitarists as Django Reinhardt, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, and George Benson. In 1987, Vaughan listed Lonnie Mack first among the guitarists he had listened to, both as a youngster and as an adult. Vaughan observed that Mack was \\"ahead of his time\\" and said, \\"I got a lot of my fast stuff from Lonnie\\".Menn, Secrets From The Masters, Miller-Freeman, Inc, 1992, p. 278, On another occasion, Vaughan said that he had learned tremolo picking and vibrato from Mack and that Mack had taught him to \\"play guitar from the heart.\\" Mack recalled his first meeting with Vaughan in 1978: Vaughan's relationship with another Texas blues legend, Johnny Winter, was a little more complex. Although they met several times, and often played sessions with the same musicians or even performed the same material, as in the case of Boot Hill, Vaughan always refrained from acknowledging Winter in any form. In his biography, \\"Raisin' Cain\\", Winter says that he was unnerved after reading Vaughan stating in an interview that he never met or knew Johnny Winter. \\"We even played together over at Tommy Shannon's house one time.\\" Vaughan settled the issue in 1988 on the occasion of a blues festival in Europe where both he and Winter were on the bill, explaining that he has been misquoted and that \\"Every musician in Texas knows Johnny and has learned something from him\\". Asked to compare their playing styles in an interview in 2010, Winter admitted that \\"mine's a little bit rawer, I think.\\" Equipment=Guitars= Vaughan owned and used a variety of guitars during his career. His guitar of choice, and the instrument that he became most associated with, was the Fender Stratocaster, his favorite being a 1963 body, with a 1962 neck, and pickups dated from 1959. This is why Vaughan usually referred to his Stratocaster as a, \\"1959 Strat.\\" He explained why he favored this guitar in a 1983 interview: \\"I like the strength of its sound. Any guitar I play has got to be pretty versatile. It's got a big, strong tone and it'll take anything I do to it.\\" Vaughan also referred to this instrument as his \\"first wife,\\" or, \\"Number One.\\" Another favourite guitar, was a slightly later Strat he named 'Lenny' after his wife, Lenora. While at a local pawn shop in 1980, Vaughan had noticed this particular guitar, a 1965 Stratocaster that had been refinished in red, with the original sunburst finish peeking through. It also had a 1910 Mandolin inlay just below the bridge. The pawn shop was asking $300 for it, which was way more than Vaughan had at the time. Lenny saw how badly he wanted this guitar, so she got six of their friends to chip in $50 each, and bought it for him. The guitar was presented to him on his birthday in 1980, and that night, after bringing \\"Lenny\\" (the guitar, and wife) home with him, he wrote the song, \\"Lenny.\\" He started using a borrowed Stratocaster during high school and used Stratocasters predominantly in his live performances and recordings, although he did play other guitars, including custom guitars. One of the custom guitars‚Äînicknamed \\"Main\\"‚Äîwas built by James Hamilton of Hamiltone Guitars in Buffalo, New York. It was a gift from Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top. Gibbons had commissioned Hamilton to build the guitar in 1979. There were some delays, including having to re-do the mother of pearl inlay of Vaughan's name on the fretboard when he changed his stage name from Stevie Vaughan to Stevie Ray Vaughan. The guitar was presented to him by Jim Hamilton on April 29, 1984. Hamilton recalls that Stevie Ray Vaughan was so happy with the guitar that he played it that night at Springfest on the University of Buffalo campus. It remained one of the main guitars he used on stage and in studio. Vaughan made some alterations to the guitar, including replacing the bronze color Gibson knobs with white Fender knobs, as he preferred the ribbing on the Fender knobs. The pickups had to be changed after the guitar was used in the \\"Couldn't Stand the Weather\\" video, in which Stevie and \\"Main\\" were drenched with water, and the pickups were ruined. The guitar was also used in the \\"Cold Shot\\" video. Jim Hamilton-signed Stevie Ray Vaughan reproduction guitar #01 Jim Hamilton signature on rear of headstock Vaughan bought many Stratocasters and gave some away as gifts. A sunburst Diplomat Strat-style guitar was purchased by Vaughan and given to his girlfriend Janna Lapidus to learn to play on. Vaughan used a custom set of uncommonly heavy strings, gauges .013, .015, .019, .028, .038, .058, and tuned a half-step below standard tuning. He played with so much tension that it was not uncommon for him to separate his fingernail from the quick movement along the strings. The owner of an Austin club recalled Vaughan coming into the office between sets to borrow super glue, which he used to keep fingernail split from widening while he continued to play. The super glue was suggested by Rene Martinez, who was Stevie's guitar technician. Martinez eventually convinced Stevie to change to slightly lighter strings. He preferred a guitar neck with an asymmetrical profile (thicker at the top) which was more comfortable for his thumb-over style of playing. Heavy use of the vibrato bar necessitated frequent replacements; Vaughan often had his roadie, Byron Barr, obtain custom stainless steel bars made by Barr's father. Vaughan was also photographed playing a National Duolian, Epiphone Riviera, Gibson Flying V, as well as several other models. Vaughan used a Gibson Johnny Smith to record \\"Stang's Swang\\", and a Guild 12-string acoustic for his performance on MTV Unplugged in January 1990. On June 24, 2004, one of Vaughan's Stratocasters, the aforementioned \\"Lenny\\" strat, was sold at an auction to benefit Eric Clapton's Crossroads Centre in Antigua; the instrument was bought by Guitar Center for $623,500. On the acoustic side, Vaughan played a Guild F-412 12-string guitar. =Amplifiers and effects= Vaughan was a catalyst in the revival of vintage amplifiers and effects during the 1980s. His loud volume and use of heavy strings required powerful and robust amplifiers. Vaughan used two black-face Fender Super Reverbs, which were crucial in shaping his clear overdriven sound. He would often blend other amps with the Super Reverbs, including black-face Fender Vibroverbs, and brands such as Dumble, and Marshall, which he used for his clean sound. While his mainstay effects were the Ibanez Tube Screamer and a Vox wah-wah pedal, Vaughan experimented with a range of effects. He used a Fender Vibratone, designed as a Leslie speaker for electric guitars, and provided a warbling chorus effect, which can be heard on the track \\"Cold Shot\\". He used a vintage Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face that can be heard on In Step, as well as an Octavia. The Guitar Geek website provides a detailed illustration of Vaughan's 1985 equipment set up based on interviews with his guitar tech and effects builder, Cesar Diaz.Cooper, Adam (2000). \\"Stevie Ray Vaughn's 1985 Guitar Rig Diagram\\". GuitarGeek.Com. Legacy Vaughan throughout his career revived blues rock and paved the way for many other artists. Vaughan's work continues to influence numerous blues, rock and alternative artists, including John Mayer, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Mike McCready, Albert Cummings, Los Lonely Boys and Chris Duarte, among others. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine described Vaughan as \\"the leading light in American blues\\" and developed \\"a uniquely eclectic and fiery style that sounded like no other guitarist, regardless of genre\\". In 1983, Variety magazine called Vaughan the \\"guitar hero of the present era\\". In the months that followed his death, Vaughan sold over 5.5 million albums in the United States. On September 25, 1990, Epic released Family Style, an LP the Vaughan brothers cut at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee. The label released several promotional singles and videos for the collaborative effort. In November 1990, CMV Enterprises released Pride and Joy, a collection of eight Double Trouble music videos. Sony signed a deal with the Vaughan estate to obtain control of his back catalog, as well as permission to release albums with previously unreleased material and new collections of released work. On October 29, 1991, The Sky Is Crying was released as Vaughan's first posthumous album with Double Trouble, and featured studio recordings from 1984 to 1985. Other compilations, live albums, and films have also been released since his death. On October 3, 1991, Texas governor Ann Richards proclaimed \\"Stevie Ray Vaughan Commemoration Day\\", during which a memorial concert was held at the Texas Theatre. In 1993, a memorial statue of Vaughan was unveiled on Auditorium Shores and is the first public monument of a musician in Austin. In September 1994, a Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Run for Recovery was held in Dallas; the event was a benefit for the Ethel Daniels Foundation, established to help those in recovery from alcoholism and drug addiction who cannot afford treatment. In 1999, the Musicians' Assistance Program (later renamed MusiCares MAP Fund) created the \\"Stevie Ray Vaughan Award\\" to honor the memory of Vaughan and to recognize musicians for their devotion to helping other addicts struggling with the recovery process. The recipients include Eric Clapton, David Crosby, Steven Tyler, Alice Cooper, Ozzy Osbourne, Pete Townshend, Chris Cornell, Jerry Cantrell, Mike McCready, among others. In 1993, Martha Vaughan established the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial Scholarship Fund, awarded to students at W.E. Greiner Middle School in Oakcliff who intend to attend college and pursue the arts as a profession. =Awards and honors= Vaughan won five W. C. Handy Awards and was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2000. In 1985, he was named an honorary admiral in the Texas Navy. Vaughan had a single number-one hit on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for the song \\"Crossfire\\". His album sales in the U.S. stand at over 15 million units. Family Style, released shortly after his death, won the 1991 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album and became his best-selling, non- Double Trouble studio album with over a million shipments in the U.S. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked him seventh among the \\"100 Greatest Guitar Players of All Time\\". He also became eligible for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008, but did not appear on a nominations roster until 2014. He was inducted in the RRHOF alongside Double Trouble in 2015. Guitar World magazine ranked him eighth in its list of the 100 greatest guitarists. In 1994 the city of Austin, Texas, erected the Stevie Ray Vaughan Memorial on the hiking trail beside Lady Bird Lake.

Between 1966 and 1973, Croce released five studio albums and numerous singles. His first two albums were commercially unsuccessful, failing to chart or produce any hit singles. During this period, Croce took a series of odd jobs to pay bills while he continued to write, record, and perform concerts. After forming a partnership with songwriter and guitarist Maury Muehleisen his fortunes turned in the early 1970s. His breakthrough came in 1972; his third album You Don't Mess Around with Jim produced three charting singles, including \\"Time in a Bottle\\", which reached No. 1 after his death. The follow-up album, Life and Times, contained the song \\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown\\", which was the only No. 1 hit he had during his lifetime. On September 20, 1973, the day before the lead single to his fifth album, I Got a Name, was released, Croce, along with five others, was killed in a plane crash, at the height of his popularity. Croce's music continued to chart throughout the 1970s following his death. His wife, Ingrid Croce, was his early songwriting partner and she continued to write and record after his death, and his son A. J. Croce himself became a singer-songwriter in the 1990s.

Flora Mary Croce (Babusci) daughter of Massimo Babusci born August 13, 1884, in Trasacco (Abruzzo), and Bernice Babusci (Ippolito or Ippoliti) born circa 1888 in Balsorano (Abruzzo). Croce grew up in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania just outside of Philadelphia and attended Upper Darby High School. Graduating in 1960, he studied at Malvern Preparatory School for a year before enrolling at Villanova University, where he majored in psychology and minored in German. He received a Bachelor of Science in Social Studies degree in 1965. Croce was a member of the Villanova Singers and the Villanova Spires. When the Spires performed off-campus or made recordings, they were known as The Coventry Lads.

Retrieved on July 6, 2013.  Career = Early career = Croce did not take music seriously until he studied at Villanova, where he formed bands and performed at fraternity parties, coffee houses, and universities around Philadelphia, playing \\"anything that the people wanted to hear: blues, rock, a cappella, railroad music ... anything.\\" Croce's band was chosen for a foreign exchange tour of Africa, the Middle East, and Yugoslavia. He later said, \\"We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn't speak English over there but if you mean what you're singing, people understand.\\" On November 29, 1963, Croce met his future wife Ingrid Jacobson at the Philadelphia Convention Hall during a hootenanny, where he was judging a contest. Croce released his first album, Facets, in 1966, with 500 copies pressed. The album had been financed with a $500 ($ in dollars) wedding gift from Croce's parents, who set a condition that the money must be spent to make an album. They hoped that he would give up music after the album failed, and use his college education to pursue a \\"respectable\\" profession. However, the album proved a success, with every copy sold. = 1960s = Croce married Ingrid in 1966, and converted to Judaism, as his wife was Jewish. He and Ingrid were married in a traditional Jewish ceremony. He enlisted in the Army National Guard that same year to avoid being drafted and deployed to Vietnam, and served on active duty for four months, leaving for duty a week after his honeymoon.The Inquirer (August 13, 1967 issue) Croce, who was not good with authority, had to go through basic training twice. He said he would be prepared if \\"there's ever a war where we have to defend ourselves with mops.\\" From the mid-1960s to early 1970s, Croce performed with his wife as a duo. At first, their performances included songs by artists such as Ian & Sylvia, Gordon Lightfoot, Joan Baez, and Arlo Guthrie, but in time they began writing their own music. During this time, Croce got his first long-term gig at a suburban bar and steakhouse in Lima, Pennsylvania, called The Riddle Paddock. His set list covered several genres, including blues, country, rock and roll, and folk. In 1968, the Croces were encouraged by record producer Tommy West to move to New York City. The couple spent time in the Kingsbridge section of the Bronx and recorded their first album with Capitol Records. During the next two years, they drove more than ,Croce's Restaurant- San Diego.

Becoming disillusioned by the music business and New York City, they sold all but one guitar to pay the rent and returned to the Pennsylvania countryside, settling in an old farm in Lyndell, where playing for $25 a night ($ in dollars) was not enough money to live on, and Croce was forced to take odd jobs such as driving trucks, construction work and teaching guitar to pay the bills while continuing to write songs, often about the characters he would meet at the local bars and truck stops and his experiences at work; these provided the material for such songs as \\"Big Wheel\\" and \\"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues.\\"Jim Croce Anthology (Songbook): The Stories Behind the Songs, By Ingrid Croce, Jim Croce = 1970s = Croce performing They returned to Philadelphia and Croce decided to be \\"serious\\" about becoming a productive member of society. \\"I'd worked construction crews, and I'd been a welder while I was in college.

Salviuolo and Croce had been friends when they studied at Villanova University, and Salviuolo had met Muehleisen when he was teaching at Glassboro State College in New Jersey. Salviuolo brought Croce and Muehleisen together at the production office of Tommy West and Terry Cashman in New York City. Croce at first backed Muehleisen on guitar, but gradually their roles reversed, with Muehleisen adding a lead guitar to Croce's music. When Jim Croce and Ingrid discovered they were going to have a child, Jim became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could get a record deal. When their son Adrian James (A.J.) was born in September 1971, Ingrid became a stay-at-home mom while Jim went on the road to promote his music. In 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with ABC Records, releasing two albums, You Don't Mess Around with Jim and Life and Times. The singles \\"You Don't Mess Around with Jim\\", \\"Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)\\" and \\"Time in a Bottle\\" all received airplay. Also that year, the Croce family moved to San Diego, California. Croce began appearing on television, including his national debut on American Bandstandamericanbandstandperformerlist on August 12, The Tonight Showjohnnycarson.com on August 14 and The Dick Cavett Show on September 20 and 21. Croce began touring the United States with Muehleisen, performing in large coffee houses, on college campuses and at folk festivals. However, his financial situation was still bad. The record company had fronted him the money to record and much of his earnings went to pay back the advance. Croce and Muehleisen travelled to Europe, performing in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Zurich and Dublin and receiving positive reviews. Croce made television appearances on The Midnight Special, which he co-hosted on , and The Helen Reddy Show on July 19. Croce's biggest single, \\"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown,\\" reached Number 1 on the American charts in July. From July 16 through August 4, Croce and Muehleisen returned to London and performed on The Old Grey Whistle Test, where they sang \\"Lover's Cross\\" and \\"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues\\" from their upcoming album I Got a Name. Croce finished recording the album just a week before his death. While on tour, he grew increasingly homesick and decided to take a break from music and settle with Ingrid and A.J. when his Life and Times tour ended. In a letter to Ingrid which arrived after his death, Croce told her he had decided to quit music and stick to writing short stories and movie scripts as a career and withdraw from  Death  On Thursday, September 20, 1973, during Croce's Life and Times tour and the day before his ABC single \\"I Got a Name\\" was released, Croce and all five others on board were killed when their chartered Beechcraft E18S crashed into a tree during takeoff from the Natchitoches Regional Airport in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Croce was 30 years old. Others killed in the crash were pilot Robert N. Elliott, Maury Muehleisen, comedian George Stevens, manager and booking agent Kenneth D. Cortese and road manager Dennis Rast. An hour before the crash, Croce had completed a concert at Northwestern State University's Prather Coliseum in Natchitoches; he was flying to Sherman, Texas, for a concert at Austin College. An investigation by the NTSB named the probable cause as the pilot's failure to see the obstruction due to physical impairment and because fog reduced his vision. The 57-year-old Elliott suffered from severe coronary artery disease and had run three miles to the airport from a motel. He had an ATP certificate, 14,290 hours total flight time and 2,190 hours in the Beech 18 type airplane. A later investigation placed the sole blame on pilot error due to his downwind takeoff into a \\"black hole\\" of severe darkness, limiting his use of visual references. Croce was buried at Haym Salomon Memorial Park in Frazer, Pennsylvania.  Legacy  The album I Got a Name was released on December 1, 1973. The posthumous release included three hits: \\"Workin' at the Car Wash Blues,\\" \\"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song,\\" and the title song, which had been used as the theme to the film The Last American Hero which was released two months prior to his death. The album reached No. 2 and \\"I'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song\\" reached No. 9 on the singles chart. While ABC had not originally released the song \\"Time In A Bottle\\" as a single, Croce's untimely death gave its lyrics, dealing with mortality and the wish to have more time, an additional resonance. The song subsequently received a large amount of airplay as an album track, and demand for a single release built. When it was eventually issued as a 7\\", it became his second and final No. 1 hit.Whitburn, Joel. The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 7th edition, Billboard Books, 2000, p. 159. After the single had finished its two-week run at the top in early January 1974, the album You Don't Mess Around with Jim became No. 1 for five weeks.Whitburn, Joel. The Billboard Book of Top Pop Albums 1955‚Äì1985, Record Research Inc., 1985, p. 88, 505. A greatest hits album entitled Photographs & Memories was released in 1974. Later posthumous releases have included Home Recordings: Americana, The Faces I've Been, Jim Croce: Classic Hits, Down the Highway, and DVD and CD releases of Croce's television performances, Have You Heard: Jim Croce Live. In 1990, Croce was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. On July 3, 2012, Ingrid Croce published a memoir about her husband entitled I Got a Name: The Jim Croce Story. In 1985, Ingrid Croce opened Croce's Restaurant & Jazz Bar, a project she and Jim had jokingly discussed over a decade earlier, in the historic Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego. She owned and managed it until it closed on December 31, 2013. In December 2013, she opened Croce's Park West on 5th Avenue in the Bankers Hill neighborhood near Balboa Park. She closed this restaurant in January 2016. Croce's music has appeared in several popular movies and television shows, such as Invincible, The Hangover Part II, Django Unchained, X-Men: Days of Future Past, Logan, Hobbs and Shaw, I Know This Much Is True, and Stranger Things.

The name fancy rat derives from the idea of animal fancy (the promotion of domesticated animals) or the phrase \\"to fancy\\" (meaning to like or appreciate). Wild-caught specimens that become docile and are bred for many generations still fall under the fancy type. Fancy rats were originally targets for blood sport in 18th- and 19th-century Europe. Later bred as pets, they now come in a wide variety of coat colors and patterns, and are bred and raised by several rat enthusiast groups around the world. They are sold in pet stores and by breeders. Fancy rats are generally easy to care for provided plenty of research is done and are quite affordable, even compared to other small pets; this is one of their biggest draws. Additionally, they are quite independent, loyal and easily trained. They are considered more intelligent than other domesticated rodents. Healthy fancy rats typically live 2 to 3 years. Fancy rats are used widely in medical research, as their physiology is very similar to that of humans. When used in this field, they are referred to as laboratory rats (lab rats). Domesticated rats are physiologically and psychologically different from their wild relatives, and typically pose no more of a health risk than other common pets. For example, domesticated brown rats are not considered a disease threat, although exposure to wild rat populations could introduce pathogens like the bacteria Streptobacillus moniliformis into the home. Fancy rats have different health risks than their wild counterparts, and thus are unlikely to succumb to the same illnesses as wild rats.  History  The blood sport of rat-baiting was an antecedent for the practice of keeping rats as pets. Jack Black made his living not only from catching rats, but also from selling them for use in baiting. The origin of the modern fancy rat begins with the rat-catchers of the 18th and 19th centuries who trapped rats throughout Europe. These rat-catchers would then either kill the rats, or, more likely, sell the rats to be used in blood sport. Rat-baiting was a popular sport until the beginning of the 20th century. It involved filling a pit with several rats and then placing bets on how long it would take a terrier to kill them all. It is believed that both rat-catchers and sportsmen began to keep certain, odd-colored rats during the height of the sport, eventually breeding them and then selling them as pets. The two men thought to have formed the basis of rat fancy are Jack Black, self-proclaimed rat-catcher to Queen Victoria, and Jimmy Shaw, manager of one of the largest sporting public houses in London. These two men are responsible for beginning many of the color varieties present today. Black, specifically, was known for taming the \\"prettier\\" rats of unusual color, decorating them with ribbons, and selling them as pets. Rat fancy as a formal, organized hobby began when a woman named Mary Douglas asked for permission to bring her pet rats to an exhibition of the National Mouse Club at the Aylesbury Town Show in England on October 24, 1901. Her black-and-white hooded rat won \\"Best in Show\\" and ignited interest in the area. After Douglas' death in 1921, rat fancy soon began to fall back out of fashion. The original hobby formally lasted from 1912 to 1929 or 1931, as part of the National Mouse and Rat Club, at which point Rat was dropped from the name, returning it to the original National Mouse Club. The hobby was revived in 1976 with the formation of the English National Fancy Rat Society (NFRS). Pet rats are now commonly available in stores and from breeders, and there exist several rat fancier groups worldwide.  Differences from wild rats  While domesticated rats are not removed enough from their wild counterparts to justify a distinct subspecies (compare Canis lupus familiaris), there are significant differences that set them apart; the most apparent is coloring. Random color mutations may occur in the wild, but these are rare. Most wild R. norvegicus are a dark brown color, while fancy rats may be anything from white to cinnamon to blue.Refer to specific information in the Varieties section Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer than those in the wild. They are more comfortable around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and for a longer period of time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted amounts of time in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox). The body structure of domesticated rats differs from that of a wild rat as well. The body of a fancy rat is smaller, with larger ears and a longer tail than that of its undomesticated counterpart. They are generally smaller with sharper facial features as well. Domesticated rats have a longer lifespan than that of wild rats. Because domesticated rats are protected from predators and have ready access to food, water, shelter, and medical care, their average lifespan is around two to three years, in contrast to wild R. norvegicus which average a lifespan of less than one year. However, wild rats generally have larger brains, hearts, livers, kidneys, and adrenal glands than laboratory rats. The fancy rat and wild rat also both face a multitude of differing health concerns; the former is at risk of developing a pneumococcal infection from exposure to humans, while the latter may harbor tapeworms after coming in contact with carriers like cockroaches and fleas.Refer to specific information in the Health section.  Social behavior  Generally speaking, rats are quite sociable and function best with at least one cage mate. It is generally ill-advised to keep a single rat unless there are severe behavioral problems. The earlier rats are introduced to one another, the better. Often, rat breeders will encourage new owners to take two or more rats of the same sex from the same litter for starters.Young rats (approximately 3 weeks old) Particularly with males, there can be some fighting in the beginning, but once an alpha rat has been determined, the rats should get along well. Within two weeks to a month, the rats will most likely have adjusted and become friendlier with each other. Rats are generally very friendly to other cage mates. They will even sometimes help or take care of other sick rats. Generally when two or more rats from the same litter are of the same sex, they live together with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although it is possible that rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats. Techniques for integration include bringing them to neutral ground so they do not become territorial. The process of integrating is easiest with two rats of young age, generally less than six months old. The process of integrating is most difficult with two or more adult male rats, as adult males are the least likely to accept new cage mates, especially after an alpha has been established. Unless there is an issue integrating rats together, owners should always keep them in a group of at least three, as rats live in packs and a pack starts with three animals.  Varieties  The American Blue is one of several standardized coat colors As in other pet species, a variety of colors, coat types, and other features that do not appear in the wild have either been developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Fancy rats in themselves are a subspecies and as such do not have distinctive breeds. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo. = Coloring = While some pet rats retain the agouti coloring of the wild brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include agouti, cinnamon, and fawn. Black-based colors include black, beige, blue, and chocolate. Eye color is considered a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two differently-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black, but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red. Color names can vary for more vaguely defined varieties, like lilac and fawn, while the interpretations of standards can fluctuate between (and even within) different countries or clubs. = Markings = Himalayan rats have a unique color and marking variation Further dividing the varieties of fancy rats are the many different markings. Fancy rats can appear in any combination of colors and markings. The markings are typically in reference to the patterns and ratios of colored hair versus white hair. Two extremes would be a self (completely solid, non-white color) and a Himalayan (completely white except blending into colored areas at the nose and feet, called points, as in a Himalayan cat's markings). Markings have a strict standard, with detailed terminology, for showing in fancy rat pet shows. However, many domestic rats are not closely bred to any color standard; many of those found in pet shops will have mismarkings from a formal breeding perspective, which are defined as variations in markings that are not recognized as conforming to a breed standard published by a rat fancier organisation. Commonly recognized standards include: * Berkshire ‚Äì colored top, white belly * hooded ‚Äì color runs in a saddle, a single, unbroken line from the full head down to the spine and possibly partly down the tail * capped ‚Äì color on the full head only * blazed ‚Äì colored head (capped) or body (Irish, Berkshire or self) with a triangular wedge of white fur over the face. * variegated ‚Äì any form of mismatched oddities in the fur. Can be anything from a broken or spotted hood to a misshaped blaze. * Irish or English Irish ‚Äì In England, the Irish is standardized by the NFRS as an equilateral triangle of white with a side that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid- length. In the United States and elsewhere, clubs like the AFRMA distinguish this marking as the English Irish and allow for another standardized Irish in which the rat may have white of an even or symmetrical nature anywhere along its underside. Other marking varieties include spotted or Dalmatian (named for the spotted Dalmatian dog), Essex, masked, Himalayan (typically a gradient of color along the body, darkest at the base of the tail and nose as in Siamese cats), and Down Under or Downunder (an Australian variety which has a solid color stripe on the belly or a color marking there that corresponds to the markings on the top). Dalmatian Fancy Rat = Body type = A male Dumbo rat, a variety with ears placed lower on the head Two of the most prominent and standardized physical changes applied to rats through selective breeding are the development of the Manx rat and Dumbo rat. The Dumbo rat, whose origins are in the United States, is characterized by having large, low, round ears on the sides of its head, and was named for its resemblance to the fictional character Dumbo the Flying Elephant. The Manx rat is tailless due to a genetic mutation, and was named for the Manx cat which shares this feature, though not necessarily due to the same mutation. = Coat types = There is a relatively small variety of coats in relation to the number of colors and markings, and not all are internationally standardized. The most common type is the normal or standard, which is allowed variance in coarseness between the sexes; males have a coarse, thick, rough coat, while females' coats are softer and finer. Other standardized coats include: rex, in which all the hairs are curly, even the whiskers; velveteen, a softer variation of the rex; satin or silky coat, which is extra-soft and fine, with a sheen; and Harley, characterized by wispy long straight hairs. Remaining coat types are not defined by the hair itself, but rather by the lack of it, such as hairless rats.  Hairless rats  Even though this rat is hairless, left Hairless rats are a coat variety characterized by varying levels of hair loss. Hairless rats, bred from curly- coated rexes, range from having areas of very short fur to being completely naked. Hairless rats are genetically produced by breeding different combinations of the genes that cause rex coats. Since rex is a dominant trait, there only needs to be one rex parent to produce curly rex-coated offspring. However, when two copies of the trait are present, by breeding two rexes together, the coat is affected differently‚Äîcausing hairlessness, and earning the colloquial name \\"double-rex\\". One subset of semi-hairless rats, patchwork rats, constantly lose their hair and regrow it in different \\"patches\\" several times throughout their life. It is usually not advised to keep hairless rats outside of laboratories when they are required for research, as they are subject to a plethora of health problems such as kidney and liver failure, as well as many skin conditions and a dramatically shortened life span. = Ethics of selective breeding = There is controversy among rat fanciers in regard to selective breeding. On one hand, breeding rats to \\"conform\\" to a specific standard or to develop a new one is a large part of what the fancy was founded on. On the other hand, the process results in many rats who do not \\"conform\\", and are then either given away, sold as food, or killed‚Äîthe latter referred to as culling. There are concerns as to whether breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can be at risk for life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region, like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services. = Availability = Because R. norvegicus and related species are seen as pests, their intentional import into foreign countries is often regulated. For example, the importation of foreign rodents is prohibited in Australia, and so various coat types, colors, and varieties have been bred separately from foreign lines, or are just not obtainable within that country (for example, hairless and Dumbo rats do not exist in Australia). In other areas, like the Canadian province of Alberta, which is considered rat-free, the ownership of domestic fancy rats outside of schools, laboratories, and zoos is illegal.  Health  Fancy rats of both sexes commonly develop mammary tumors as they age. These are usually benign, but multiple tumors can persist even after removal. Human-raised R. norvegicus are more prone to specific health risks and diseases than their wild counterparts, but they are also far less likely to succumb to certain illnesses that are prevalent in the wild. The major considerations for susceptibility include exposure, living conditions, and diet. Rats that live their entire lives indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing bacteria such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and well-balanced diet, along with access to medical care. Porphyrin is a browny-red substance which fancy rats can develop around the eyes and nose. It may appear like dried blood, but is a mucus-like substance which is released at times of stress or if the rat has a respiratory infection. It can also be caused by temporary irritation in the eye such as the rat accidentally scratching its eye while grooming. While living indoors decreases the risk of contracting certain diseases, living in close quarters with other rats, being unable to always seek proper protection from environmental factors (e.g. temperature, humidity), being fed an unhealthy diet, and the stresses inherently associated with living in an unnatural habitat can all adversely affect a rat's health to make them more prone to specific conditions. Specifically, Tyzzer's disease, protozoic infections (e.g. Giardia muris), and pseudotuberculosis are usually seen in stressed or young rats. Additionally, pet rats are exposed to Streptococcus pneumoniae, a zoonotic disease caught from humans, not the same bacteria associated with pneumonia. A human-associated fungus, Pneumocystis carinii (also found in almost all domesticated animals) is usually asymptomatic in the rat, unless the rat's immune system is compromised by illness. If this occurs the infection can develop into pneumonia. Several diseases, like Rat Coronavirus Infection (RCI), Sendai virus, and Murine Respiratory Mycoplasmosis (MRM, Mycoplasma pulmonis), are prevalent simply because their highly contagious natures work in tandem with the way rats are kept in laboratories, pet stores, and by breeders. MRM is far less likely to occur in laboratory rats than in those kept as pets. Pet rats can also develop pituitary tumors if they are given high-calorie diets, and ringtail if they are placed in areas with low humidity or high temperatures. Staphylococcus spp. are a mostly benign group of bacteria that commonly reside on the top of the skin, but cuts and scratches from social and hierarchical fighting can open up the pathways for them to cause ulcerative dermatitis. There is some evidence that spayed female rats (\\"does\\") are less likely to develop mammary and pituitary tumors than non-spayed females. Research into prevention of common diseases and health issues in rats is on-going. Dietary changes are among the main suggestions for improved health and longevity in fancy rats, such suggestions included are feeding rat-friendly superfoods in moderation to reduce the risk of cancers, heart disease and stroke. = Risks to owners = Keeping rats as pets can come with the stigma that rats supposedly transmit dangerous diseases to their owners. One fear is that all rats carry plague, when in fact R. norvegicus is not among the list of species considered a threat. In 2004, an outbreak of salmonella in the United States was connected to people who owned pet rats. However, it has been determined that a pet rat's initial exposure to salmonella, along with many other zoonotic rat diseases, typically indicates exposure to wild rodent populations, either from an infestation in the owner's home, or from the pet's contaminated food, water, or bedding. Another risk to rat owners is rat-bite fever. This is a rare disease among domesticated rats and is most often found in rats from large chain pet stores who breed their stock of rats in masses (usually with the intention of being snake food rather than pets) or from breeders who fail to take good care of their rats. This disease is fairly unnoticeable in the rat, but is characterized by the swelling of the site of the bite or scratch where it was contracted, a fever, vomiting and body aches. It is contracted by being bitten or scratched by an infected rat. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control reported an outbreak of Seoul virus spread by pet rats.  Fiction  In fiction, pet brown rats are often depicted as tamed rather than domesticated, akin to when a character befriends a wolf. As tamed pets, they have been portrayed in roles that vary from evil to ambiguous to lovable. Samantha Martin, a professional animal trainer for films, commercials, and music videos, has claimed that rats are one of the easiest animals to train due to their adaptability, intelligence, and focus. In Flushed Away, Roddy St. James is a pampered pet fancy rat in a posh Kensington flat. In the direct-to-video sequels to the 1987 film The Brave Little Toaster, The Brave Little Toaster to the Rescue and The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars, Ratso is the pet rat of Rob McGroarty. The novella Ratman's Notebooks by Stephen Gilbert was the basis for the films Willard (1971) and Ben (1972), and a 2003 remake of the first film. Here, the protagonist befriends the rats found in his home and builds up a close relationship, only to have it end tragically. While these movies generally emphasize the popular perception of malevolence‚Äîthey kill people and cats and ransack grocery stores‚Äîother wild rats who become pets are portrayed in more neutral to positive ways; the television show, House, briefly featured \\"Steve McQueen\\", the pet rat of the titular character. In certain versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, the master and adoptive father of the turtles is Splinter, who was once the pet rat of ninja Hamato Yoshi and learned his martial arts skills by imitating his owner. In the 1996 point-and- click adventure game Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh, the protagonist Curtis Craig owns a pet rat named Blob, which is seen various times in the game and is even involved in one of the many puzzles that the player must decipher. Pet rats are unofficially allowed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the Harry Potter series, but are not generally seen as desirable pets. Ron Weasley's pet rat Scabbers is eventually revealed to be a magically transformed human in league with the main villain.

He advocated British Empire Federalism and, late in life, a world state. His ideas concerning dyarchy were important in the development of the Government of India Act 1919 and more generally, his writings influenced the evolution of the Commonwealth of Nations. Life Curtis was born at Coddington, Herefordshire in 1872, the youngest of the four children of George James Curtis, Anglican rector of the parish, and his wife Frances Carr, daughter of the Rev. John Edmund Carr. He was educated at Haileybury College and then at New College, Oxford, where he read law. He fought in the Second Boer War with the City Imperial Volunteers and served as secretary to Lord Milner (a position that had also been held by adventure-novelist John Buchan), during which time he dedicated himself to working for a united self-governing South Africa. Following Milner's death in 1925, he became the second leader of Milner's Kindergarten until his own death in 1955. His experience led him to conceptualize his version of a Federal World Government, which became his life work. In pursuit of this goal, he founded (1910) the quarterly Round Table. He was appointed (1912) Beit lecturer in colonial history at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of All Souls College. In 1919 Curtis led a delegation of British and American experts to organize the Royal Institute of International Affairs during the Peace Conference of Paris.Edgar Trevor Williams, A. F. Madden, David Kenneth Fieldhouse. Oxford and the Idea of Commonwealth. Routledge, 1982. (Pages 39, 98) In 1947, Curtis was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize; in 1949, he was appointed a Companion of Honour, on the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of Chatham House. Works Curtis' most important books were: * The Commonwealth of Nations (1916); * Dyarchy (1920); and, * Civitas Dei: The Commonwealth of God (1938), arguing that the United States must rejoin the British commonwealth and that the Commonwealth must evolve into a world government.

D. 1979. Deltas. in R. G. Walker (ed) Facies Models. Geological Association of Canada, Hamilton, Ontario.Elliot, T. 1986. Deltas. in H. G. Reading (ed.). Sedimentary environments and facies. Backwell Scientific Publications, Oxford. This occurs where a river enters an ocean, sea, estuary, lake, reservoir, or (more rarely) another river that cannot carry away the supplied sediment. The size and shape of a delta is controlled by the balance between watershed processes that supply sediment, and receiving basin processes that redistribute, sequester, and export that sediment. The size, geometry, and location of the receiving basin also plays an important role in delta evolution. River deltas are important in human civilization, as they are major agricultural production centers and population centers. They can provide coastline defense and can impact drinking water supply. They are also ecologically important, with different species' assemblages depending on their landscape position. Etymology A river delta is so named because the shape of the Nile River's delta approximates the triangular uppercase greek letter delta. Despite a popular legend, this use of the word delta was not coined by Herodotus.  Formation  A delta forms where a river meets a lake River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta. When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). As the slope of the river channel decreases, it becomes unstable for two reasons. First, gravity makes the water flow in the most direct course downslope. If the river breaches its natural levees (i.e., during a flood), it spills out into a new course with a shorter route to the ocean, thereby obtaining a more stable steeper slope.Slingerland, R. and N. D. Smith (1998), \\"Necessary conditions for a meandering-river avulsion,\\" Geology (Boulder), 26, 435‚Äì438. Second, as its slope gets lower, the amount of shear stress on the bed decreases, which results in the deposition of sediment within the channel and a rise in the channel bed relative to the floodplain. This makes it easier for the river to breach its levees and cut a new channel that enters the body of standing water at a steeper slope. Often when the channel does this, some of its flow remains in the abandoned channel. When these channel-switching events occur, a mature delta develops a distributary network. Another way these distributary networks form is from the deposition of mouth bars (mid- channel sand and/or gravel bars at the mouth of a river). When this mid- channel bar is deposited at the mouth of a river, the flow is routed around it. This results in additional deposition on the upstream end of the mouth- bar, which splits the river into two distributary channels. A good example of the result of this process is the Wax Lake Delta. In both of these cases, depositional processes force redistribution of deposition from areas of high deposition to areas of low deposition. This results in the smoothing of the planform (or map-view) shape of the delta as the channels move across its surface and deposit sediment. Because the sediment is laid down in this fashion, the shape of these deltas approximates a fan. The more often the flow changes course, the shape develops as closer to an ideal fan, because more rapid changes in channel position resultsf in more uniform deposition of sediment on the delta front. The Mississippi and Ural River deltas, with their bird's-feet, are examples of rivers that do not avulse often enough to form a symmetrical fan shape. Alluvial fan deltas, as seen by their name, avulse frequently and more closely approximate an ideal fan shape. Most large river deltas discharge to intra-cratonic basins on the trailing edges of passive margins due to the majority of large rivers such as the Mississippi, Nile, Amazon, Ganges, Indus, Yangtze, and Yellow River discharging along passive continental margins. This phenomenon is due to three big factors: topography, basin area, and basin elevation. Topography along passive margins tend to be more gradual and widespread over a greater area enabling sediment to pile up and accumulate over time to form large river deltas. Topography along active margins tend to be steeper and less widespread, which results in sediments not having the ability to pile up and accumulate due to the sediment traveling into a steep subduction trench rather than a shallow continental shelf. There are many other smaller factors that could explain why the majority of river deltas form along passive margins rather than active margins. Along active margins, orogenic sequences cause tectonic activity to form over-steepened slopes, brecciated rocks, and volcanic activity resulting in delta formation to exist closer to the sediment source. When sediment does not travel far from the source, sediments that build up are coarser grained and more loosely consolidated, therefore making delta formation more difficult. Tectonic activity on active margins causes the formation of river deltas to form closer to the sediment source which may affect channel avulsion, delta lobe switching, and auto cyclicity. Active margin river deltas tend to be much smaller and less abundant but may transport similar amounts of sediment. However, the sediment is never piled up in thick sequences due to the sediment traveling and depositing in deep subduction trenches.  Types  Lower Mississippi River land loss over time Mississippi Delta, 4600 yrs BP, 3500 yrs BP, 2800 yrs BP, 1000 yrs BP, 300 yrs BP, 500 yrs BP, current Deltas are typically classified according to the main control on deposition, which is a combination of river, wave, and tidal processes,Galloway, W.E., 1975, Process framework for describing the morphologic and stratigraphic evolution of deltaic depositional systems, in Brousard, M.L., ed., Deltas, Models for Exploration: Houston Geological Society, Houston, Texas, pp. 87‚Äì98. depending on the strength of each.Perillo, G. M. E. 1995. Geomorphology and Sedimentology of Estuaries. Elsevier Science B.V., New York. The other two factors that play a major role are landscape position and the grain size distribution of the source sediment entering the delta from the river. = Wave-dominated deltas = In wave dominated deltas, wave-driven sediment transport controls the shape of the delta, and much of the sediment emanating from the river mouth is deflected along the coast line. The relationship between waves and river deltas is quite variable and largely influenced by the deepwater wave regimes of the receiving basin. With a high wave energy near shore and a steeper slope offshore, waves will make river deltas smoother. Waves can also be responsible for carrying sediments away from the river delta, causing the delta to retreat. For deltas that form further upriver in an estuary, there are complex yet quantifiable linkages between winds, tides, river discharge, and delta water levels. The Ganges Delta in India and Bangladesh is the largest delta in the world, and one of the most fertile regions in the world. = Tide-dominated deltas = Erosion is also an important control in tide-dominated deltas, such as the Ganges Delta, which may be mainly submarine, with prominent sandbars and ridges. This tends to produce a \\"dendritic\\" structure.Fagherazzi S., 2008, Self-organization of tidal deltas, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, vol. 105 (48): 18692‚Äì18695, Tidal deltas behave differently from a river- and wave-dominated deltas, which tend to have a few main distributaries. Once a wave- or river- dominated distributary silts up, it is abandoned, and a new channel forms elsewhere. In a tidal delta, new distributaries are formed during times when there is a lot of water around ‚Äì such as floods or storm surges. These distributaries slowly silt up at a more or less constant rate until they fizzle out. = Gilbert deltas = A Gilbert delta (named after Grove Karl Gilbert) is a type of delta formed from coarse sediments, as opposed to gently-sloping muddy deltas such as that of the Mississippi. For example, a mountain river depositing sediment into a freshwater lake would form this kind of delta.Characteristics of deltas. (Available archived at ‚Äì checked Dec 2008.) Bernard Biju-Duval, J. Edwin Swezey. \\"Sedimentary Geology\\". Page 183. . Editions TECHNIP, 2002. Partial text on Google Books. While some authors describe both lacustrine and marine locations of Gilbert deltas, others note that their formation is more characteristic of the freshwater lakes, where it is easier for the river water to mix with the lakewater faster (as opposed to the case of a river falling into the sea or a salt lake, where less dense fresh water brought by the river stays on top longer). Gilbert himself first described this type of delta on Lake Bonneville in 1885.\\"Geological and Petrophysical Characterization of the Ferron Sandstone for 3-D Simulation of a Fluvial-deltaic Reservoir\\". By Thomas C. Chidsey, Thomas C. Chidsey, Jr (ed), Utah Geological Survey, 2002. . Pages 2‚Äì17. Partial text on Google Books. Elsewhere, similar structures occur, for example, at the mouths of several creeks that flow into Okanagan Lake in British Columbia and forming prominent peninsulas at Naramata, Summerland, and Peachland. = Tidal freshwater deltas = A tidal freshwater delta is a sedimentary deposit formed at the boundary between an upland stream and an estuary, in the region known as the \\"subestuary\\". Drowned coastal river valleys that were inundated by rising sea levels during the late Pleistocene and subsequent Holocene tend to have dendritic estuaries with many feeder tributaries. Each tributary mimics this salinity gradient from their brackish junction with the mainstem estuary up to the fresh stream feeding the head of tidal propagation. As a result, the tributaries are considered to be \\"subestuaries\\". The origin and evolution of a tidal freshwater delta involves processes that are typical of all deltas as well as processes that are unique to the tidal freshwater setting. The combination of processes that create a tidal freshwater delta result in a distinct morphology and unique environmental characteristics. Many tidal freshwater deltas that exist today are directly caused by the onset of or changes in historical land use, especially deforestation, intensive agriculture, and urbanization. These ideas are well illustrated by the many tidal freshwater deltas prograding into Chesapeake Bay along the east coastline of the United States. Research has demonstrated that the accumulating sediments in this estuary derive from post-European settlement deforestation, agriculture, and urban development. = Estuaries = Other rivers, particularly those on coasts with significant tidal range, do not form a delta but enter into the sea in the form of an estuary. Notable examples include the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the Tagus estuary. = Inland deltas = Okavango DeltaIn rare cases the river delta is located inside a large valley and is called an inverted river delta. Sometimes a river divides into multiple branches in an inland area, only to rejoin and continue to the sea. Such an area is called an inland delta, and often occurs on former lake beds. The Inner Niger Delta, Peace‚ÄìAthabasca Delta, and Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta are notable examples. The Amazon also has an inland delta before the island of Maraj√≥, and the Danube has one in the valley on the Slovak-Hungarian border between Bratislava and I≈æa. In some cases, a river flowing into a flat arid area splits into channels that evaporate as it progresses into the desert. The Okavango Delta in Botswana is one example. = Mega deltas = The generic term mega delta can be used to describe very large Asian river deltas, such as the Yangtze, Pearl, Red, Mekong, Irrawaddy, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Indus.  Sedimentary structure  Delta on Kachemak Bay at low tide The formation of a delta is complicated, multiple, and cross-cutting over time, but in a simple delta three main types of bedding may be distinguished: the bottomset beds, foreset/frontset beds, and topset beds. This three part structure may be seen in small scale by crossbedding.D.G.A Whitten, The Penguin Dictionary of Geology (1972) *The bottomset beds are created from the lightest suspended particles that settle farthest away from the active delta front, as the river flow diminishes into the standing body of water and loses energy. This suspended load is deposited by sediment gravity flow, creating a turbidite. These beds are laid down in horizontal layers and consist of the finest grain sizes. *The foreset beds in turn are deposited in inclined layers over the bottomset beds as the active lobe advances. Foreset beds form the greater part of the bulk of a delta, (and also occur on the lee side of sand dunes).Robert L. Bates, Julia A. Jackson, Dictionary of Geological Terms AGI (1984) The sediment particles within foreset beds consist of larger and more variable sizes, and constitute the bed load that the river moves downstream by rolling and bouncing along the channel bottom. When the bed load reaches the edge of the delta front, it rolls over the edge, and is deposited in steeply dipping layers over the top of the existing bottomset beds. Under water, the slope of the outermost edge of the delta is created at the angle of repose of these sediments. As the foresets accumulate and advance, subaqueous landslides occur and readjust overall slope stability. The foreset slope, thus created and maintained, extends the delta lobe outward. In cross section, foresets typically lie in angled, parallel bands, and indicate stages and seasonal variations during the creation of the delta. *The topset beds of an advancing delta are deposited in turn over the previously laid foresets, truncating or covering them. Topsets are nearly horizontal layers of smaller-sized sediment deposited on the top of the delta and form an extension of the landward alluvial plain. As the river channels meander laterally across the top of the delta, the river is lengthened and its gradient is reduced, causing the suspended load to settle out in nearly horizontal beds over the delta's top. Topset beds are subdivided into two regions: the upper delta plain and the lower delta plain. The upper delta plain is unaffected by the tide, while the boundary with the lower delta plain is defined by the upper limit of tidal influence.Hori, K. and Saito, Y. Morphology and Sediments of Large River Deltas. Tokyo, Japan: Tokyo Geographical Society, 2003  Examples  The Ganges‚ÄìBrahmaputra Delta, which spans most of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India empties into the Bay of Bengal, is the world's largest delta.

Dams block sedimentation, which can cause the delta to erode away. The use of water upstream can greatly increase salinity levels as less fresh water flows to meet the salty ocean water. While nearly all deltas have been impacted to some degree by humans, the Nile Delta and Colorado River Delta are some of the most extreme examples of the ecological devastation caused to deltas by damming and diversion of water. Construction, irrigation, and land alteration have impacted delta formation. As humans have altered surface roughness, runoff, and groundwater storage, studies have shown river delta retreat. However, historical data documents show that during the Roman Empire and Little Ice Age (times where there was considerable anthropogenic pressure), there were significant sediment accumulation in deltas. The industrial revolution has only amplified the impact of humans on delta growth and retreat.  Deltas in the economy  Ancient deltas are a benefit to the economy due to their well sorted sand and gravel. Sand and gravel is often quarried from these old deltas and used in concrete for highways, buildings, sidewalks, and even landscaping. More than 1 billion tons of sand and gravel are produced in the United States alone. Not all sand and gravel quarries are former deltas, but for ones that are, much of the sorting is already done by the power of water. As urban areas and human habitation tends to locate in lowlands near water access for transportation and sanitation. Making deltas a common location for civilizations to flourish due to access to flat land for farming, freshwater for sanitation and irrigation, and sea access for trade. Deltas often host extensive industrial and commercial activities as well as agricultural land which are often in conflict. Some of the world's largest regional economies are located on deltas such as the Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta, European Low Countries and the Greater Tokyo Area.  Deltas on Mars  Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had large amounts of water. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below are pictures of a few.Irwin III, R. et al. 2005. An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars: 2.

(1994) p. 79 a software architecture for software componentry, mostly known as Newi Business Objects which coined the term business object.Erik Persson (2002) Shadows of cavernous shades: charting the chiaroscuro of realistic computing. p. 143 Newi was developed by Oliver Sims at the software engineering company Integrated Object Systems, England. It was one of the first implemented architectures for software components.  Overview  Newi was what today is called a component container. The concepts behind the Newi middleware can be found in Oliver Sims' book \\"Business Objects\\", McGraw-Hill 1994. In spite of the title, the book was about software components. Newi components were language-neutral. That is, a Newi component could be written in one of a variety of languages that was supported by Newi. At its height, Newi supported software components written in Cobol, Ada, C, C++, Rexx, and Java. Platforms supported included Windows 3.1, Win95, WinNT, three varieties of Unix - and a prototype supporting components written in RPG was running on the AS400. Newi components were intended to be \\"objects in the large\\". There was a form of sub/supertyping which was implemented by the infrastructure through an intelligent delegation mechanism. For example, a component written in C could be \\"subtyped\\" by a component written in Cobol. Component names (or types?) were separated from the code implementation module. Messages (both sync and async) were passed using a proprietary form of \\"tagged data\\" (a similar concept to today's XML). There was also a notification service. The various system services (including the GUI framework and communications subsystems) were implemented as Newi components. Throughout, there was a rigorous focus on making the programming of application components as simple as possible, with Newi providing many transparencies. From the start, Newi was targeted at both front-end GUI systems and back-end server systems. The front-end version had a GUI run-time framework implemented as components. The component concept fitted very well with the object-based UI provided. Hence a designer/programmer used the same technical code structure to implement both front-end and back-end business function.  History The initial concept behind Newi originated in 1989 when Oliver Sims,Robert Orfali, Dan Harkey, Jeri Edwards (1996) The essential distributed objects survival guide. p. 325 stated: Oliver Sims is the designer of the New World Infrastructure (Newi) ‚Äî a framework whose sole purpose is to create and run business objects. Newi ‚Äî shipped by Integrated Objects in 1994 ‚Äî is the first of a new generation of products that focus on the delivery of late-bound business objects... then working for IBM, saw the need for an infrastructure whereby a given real-world business concept (process or entity) could be implemented as a software module that could be plugged into a running system. Applications would be created by composing an appropriate set of modules. IBM UK funded development of the concept through collaboration with Softwright, a UK bespoke software company. After several successful prototypes, and an early AS400 production version, a joint venture called Integrated Object Systems (IOS) was created in 1993 to exploit the concept. The first version of Newi was announced and shipped in 1994. In early 1996, IOS was bought by SSA (System Software Associates, Inc), who saw great potential in Newi. The software was significantly further developed within SSA, in particular in its back-end capability, as well as having its underlying communications function moved to a COTS Corba product that provided the communications \\"wet string\\" while maintaining the Newi programming model and loosely coupled component interaction. Tools were also significantly expanded. SSA also announced an early and proprietary form of web services, based on the re-developed Newi, called \\"Semantic Message Gateways\\", or SMG. In 1998, for reasons other than their technology base, SSA had to downsize dramatically; Newi development was halted then abandoned, and the development team (around forty people in UK and US) was dispersed.

One method involves placing the bones to either side of the middle finger such that approximately two-thirds of their length extends along the palm while the remainder protrudes above the fingers on the backside of the hand. The hand is held in a loose fist with the bones and the curled fingers roughly parallel to the palm, with the bone closest to the ring finger gently held against the palm by the tip of the ring finger placed on its edge, while the other bone is left free to move in the \\"hinge\\" formed by the index and middle fingers as they gently hold it. It is also possible to play the \\"hinge\\" on the lower (ring finger) bone while locking the top (index finger) bone against the palm. Technique A player may use a pair of bones in each hand, or just a single pair in one hand. A critical element to playing the bones is not trying to force them to make contact with one another through finger manipulation but allowing their momentum to do the work. By moving the hand back and forth across the chest, with just enough force on the bones to keep them from falling out of the hand, a patient learner can produce a triple click. This \\"click-it-y\\" sound is the essential ingredient to playing the bones. A double- click can be produced by the same movement of the hand with the addition of a bit of pressure to the bones to suppress the third click. Once these elemental triple and double figures have been mastered, they can be combined to create complex combinations of rhythmic sounds. The effect is further enhanced by the use of two pairs of bones, one in each hand. A skilled practitioner can produce a wide variety of percussive sounds reminiscent of those made by a tap dancer. The Irish tradition is unique to the island. While North American players are typically two-handed, the Irish tradition finds the vast majority of bones players using only one hand, a distinction in method that has a strong impact on musical articulation.Vallely, F.

It is not as hard and rigid as bone, but it is much stiffer and much less flexible than muscle. The matrix of cartilage is made up of glycosaminoglycans, proteoglycans, collagen fibers and, sometimes, elastin. Because of its rigidity, cartilage often serves the purpose of holding tubes open in the body. Examples include the rings of the trachea, such as the cricoid cartilage and carina. Cartilage is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that produce a large amount of collagenous extracellular matrix, abundant ground substance that is rich in proteoglycan and elastin fibers. Cartilage is classified in three types, elastic cartilage, hyaline cartilage and fibrocartilage, which differ in relative amounts of collagen and proteoglycan. Cartilage does not contain blood vessels (it is avascular) or nerves (it is aneural). Nutrition is supplied to the chondrocytes by diffusion. The compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage generates fluid flow, which assists diffusion of nutrients to the chondrocytes. Compared to other connective tissues, cartilage has a very slow turnover of its extracellular matrix and does not repair. There are three different types of cartilage: elastic (A), hyaline (B), and fibrous (C). In elastic cartilage the cells are closer together creating less intercellular space. Elastic cartilage is found in the external ear flaps and in parts of the larynx. Hyaline cartilage has fewer cells than elastic cartilage; there is more intercellular space. Hyaline cartilage is found in the nose, ears, trachea, parts of the larynx, and smaller respiratory tubes. Fibrous cartilage has the fewest cells so it has the most intercellular space. Fibrous cartilage is found in the spine and the menisci.  Structure = Development = In embryogenesis, the skeletal system is derived from the mesoderm germ layer. Chondrification (also known as chondrogenesis) is the process by which cartilage is formed from condensed mesenchyme tissue, which differentiates into chondroblasts and begins secreting the molecules (aggrecan and collagen type II) that form the extracellular matrix. Following the initial chondrification that occurs during embryogenesis, cartilage growth consists mostly of the maturing of immature cartilage to a more mature state. The division of cells within cartilage occurs very slowly, and thus growth in cartilage is usually not based on an increase in size or mass of the cartilage itself. It has been identified that non-coding RNAs (e.g. miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) as the most important epigenetic modulators can affect the chondrogenesis. This also justifies the non-coding RNAs' contribution in various cartilage-dependent pathological conditions such as arthritis, and so on. = Articular cartilage = Section from mouse joint showing cartilage (purple) The articular cartilage function is dependent on the molecular composition of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM consists mainly of proteoglycan and collagens. The main proteoglycan in cartilage is aggrecan, which, as its name suggests, forms large aggregates with hyaluronan. These aggregates are negatively charged and hold water in the tissue. The collagen, mostly collagen type II, constrains the proteoglycans. The ECM responds to tensile and compressive forces that are experienced by the cartilage. Cartilage growth thus refers to the matrix deposition, but can also refer to both the growth and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Due to the great stress on the patellofemoral joint during resisted knee extension, the articular cartilage of the patella is among the thickest in the human body.  Function = Mechanical properties = The mechanical properties of articular cartilage in load-bearing joints such as the knee and hip have been studied extensively at macro, micro, and nano-scales. These mechanical properties include the response of cartilage in frictional, compressive, shear and tensile loading. Cartilage is resilient and displays viscoelastic properties. = Frictional properties = Lubricin, a glycoprotein abundant in cartilage and synovial fluid, plays a major role in bio-lubrication and wear protection of cartilage. = Repair = Cartilage has limited repair capabilities: Because chondrocytes are bound in lacunae, they cannot migrate to damaged areas. Therefore, cartilage damage is difficult to heal. Also, because hyaline cartilage does not have a blood supply, the deposition of new matrix is slow. Damaged hyaline cartilage is usually replaced by fibrocartilage scar tissue. Over the last years, surgeons and scientists have elaborated a series of cartilage repair procedures that help to postpone the need for joint replacement. Biological engineering techniques are being developed to generate new cartilage, using a cellular \\"scaffolding\\" material and cultured cells to grow artificial cartilage.International Cartilage Repair Society ICRS  Clinical significance  Human skeleton with articular cartilage shown in blue = Disease = Several diseases can affect cartilage. Chondrodystrophies are a group of diseases, characterized by the disturbance of growth and subsequent ossification of cartilage. Some common diseases that affect the cartilage are listed below. * Osteoarthritis: Osteoarthritis is a disease of the whole joint, however, one of the most affected tissues is the articular cartilage. The cartilage covering bones (articular cartilage‚Äîa subset of hyaline cartilage) is thinned, eventually completely wearing away, resulting in a \\"bone against bone\\" within the joint, leading to reduced motion, and pain. Osteoarthritis affects the joints exposed to high stress and is therefore considered the result of \\"wear and tear\\" rather than a true disease. It is treated by arthroplasty, the replacement of the joint by a synthetic joint often made of a stainless steel alloy (cobalt chromoly) and ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Chondroitin sulfate or glucosamine sulfate supplements, have been claimed to reduce the symptoms of osteoarthritis, but there is little good evidence to support this claim. * Traumatic rupture or detachment: The cartilage in the knee is frequently damaged but can be partially repaired through knee cartilage replacement therapy. Often when athletes talk of damaged \\"cartilage\\" in their knee, they are referring to a damaged meniscus (a fibrocartilage structure) and not the articular cartilage. * Achondroplasia: Reduced proliferation of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate of long bones during infancy and childhood, resulting in dwarfism. * Costochondritis: Inflammation of cartilage in the ribs, causing chest pain. * Spinal disc herniation : Asymmetrical compression of an intervertebral disc ruptures the sac-like disc, causing a herniation of its soft content. The hernia often compresses the adjacent nerves and causes back pain. * Relapsing polychondritis: a destruction, probably autoimmune, of cartilage, especially of the nose and ears, causing disfiguration. Death occurs by asphyxiation as the larynx loses its rigidity and collapses. Tumors made up of cartilage tissue, either benign or malignant, can occur. They usually appear in bone, rarely in pre-existing cartilage. The benign tumors are called chondroma, the malignant ones chondrosarcoma. Tumors arising from other tissues may also produce a cartilage-like matrix, the best known being pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands. The matrix of cartilage acts as a barrier, preventing the entry of lymphocytes or diffusion of immunoglobulins. This property allows for the transplantation of cartilage from one individual to another without fear of tissue rejection. = Imaging = Cartilage does not absorb X-rays under normal in vivo conditions, but a dye can be injected into the synovial membrane that will cause the x-rays to be absorbed by the dye. The resulting void on the radiographic film between the bone and meniscus represents the cartilage. For In vitro x-ray scans, the outer soft tissue is most likely removed, so the cartilage and air boundary are enough to contrast the presence of cartilage due to the refraction of the x-ray.Osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis.about.com. Retrieved on 2015-10-26. Histological image of hyaline cartilage stained with haematoxylin and eosin, under polarized light  Other animals = Cartilaginous fish = Cartilaginous fish (chondrichthyes) like sharks, rays and skates have a skeleton composed entirely of cartilage. = Invertebrate cartilage = Cartilage tissue can also be found among some arthropods such as horseshoe crabs, some mollusks such as marine snails and cephalopods, and some annelids like sabellid polychaetes. Arthropods The most studied cartilage in arthropods is the Limulus polyphemus branchial cartilage. It is a vesicular cell-rich cartilage due to the large, spherical and vacuolated chondrocytes with no homologies in other arthropods. Other type of cartilage found in Limulus polyphemus is the endosternite cartilage, a fibrous-hyaline cartilage with chondrocytes of typical morphology in a fibrous component, much more fibrous than vertebrate hyaline cartilage, with mucopolysaccharides immunoreactive against chondroitin sulfate antibodies. There are homologous tissues to the endosternite cartilage in other arthropods. The embryos of Limulus polyphemus express ColA and hyaluronan in the gill cartilage and the endosternite, which indicates that these tissues are fibrillar-collagen-based cartilage. The endosternite cartilage forms close to Hh-expressing ventral nerve cords and expresses ColA and SoxE, a Sox9 analog. This is also seen in gill cartilage tissue. Mollusks In cephalopods, the models used for the studies of cartilage are Octopus vulgaris and Sepia officinalis. The cephalopod cranial cartilage is the invertebrate cartilage that shows more resemblance to the vertebrate hyaline cartilage. The growth is thought to take place throughout the movement of cells from the periphery to the center. The chondrocytes present different morphologies related to their position in the tissue. The embryos of Sepia officinalis express ColAa, ColAb and hyaluronan in the cranial cartilages and other regions of chondrogenesis. This implies that the cartilage is fibrillar-collagen-based. The Sepia officinalis embryo expresses hh, whose presence causes ColAa and ColAb expression and is also able to maintain proliferating cells undiferentiated. It has been observed that this species presents the expression SoxD and SoxE, analogs of the vertebrate Sox5/6 and Sox9, in the developing cartilage. The cartilage growth pattern is the same as in vertebrate cartilage. In gastropods, the interest lies on the odontophore, a cartilaginous structure that supports the radula. The most studied species regarding to this particular tissue is Busycotypus canaliculatus. The odontophore is a vesicular cell rich cartilage, consisting on vacuolated cells containing myoglobin, surrounded by a low amount of extra cellular matrix containing collagen. The odontophore contains muscle cells along with the chondrocytes in the case of Lymnaea and other mollusks that graze vegetation. Sabellid polychaetes The Sabellid polychaetes, or feather duster worms, have cartilage tissue with cellular and matrix specialization supporting their tentacles. They present two distinct extracellular matrix regions. These regions are an acellular fibrous region with a high collagen content, called cartilage-like matrix, and a collagen lacking highly cellularized core, called osteoid-like matrix. The cartilage- like matrix surrounds the osteoid-like matrix. The amount of the acellular fibrous region is variable. The model organisms used in the study of cartilage in sabellid polychaetes are Potamilla sp and Myxicola infundibulum.  Plants and fungi  Vascular plants, particularly seeds, and the stems of some mushrooms, are sometimes called \\"cartilaginous\\", although they contain no cartilage.Eflora ‚Äì Glossary.

He is regarded as one of the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century and composed most of his Albanian Renaissance-inspired known works during that period. Born in the village of Drenov√´, Asdreni completed his academic studies at the University of Bucharest in Romania where he enthusiastically committed himself to the Independence of Albania from the Ottoman Empire. He maintained close liaison with fellow Gjergj Fishta and Lasgush Poradeci and was notably inspired by the patriots Girolamo de Rada and Naim Frash√´ri. Rreze dielli, a collection of 99 poems, was his first prominent work which he dedicated to the national hero of Albania Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. Devoted to Edith Durham a friend of Albania, his second collection of again 99 poems, √ãndrra e lot√´, displayed a wider range of themes and motifs as well as his more astonishing maturity.  Biography = Life and career = Asdreni was born as Aleksand√´r Stavre Drenova on 11 April 1872 into an Albanian peasant family of Eastern Orthodox faith in the village of Drenov√´ close to the city of Kor√ß√´ in what was then part of the Ottoman Empire and is now Albania. In his native village he properly received his early formal education at a Greek primary school and had just started secondary school in Kor√ß√´ subsequently his father, Stavri Thimiu, died leaving him fatherless. The surrounding region Kor√ß√´ had been a prime source of Albanian migration which was additionally strengthened by an earthquake in 1879. He consequently migrated to Bucharest in 1885 and rejoined his more elderly brothers where he also commenced his short-living studies at the Faculty of Political Science of the University of Bucharest. In the new country, Asdreni came into liasion with other Albanian intellectuals and writers with whom he started to strength the Albanian diaspora in Romania for the struggle of national liberation. Prior to that, he was strongly inspired by Girolamo de Rada and Naim Frash√´ri as well as by the Albanian Renaissance in which the Albanians came to acknowledge themselves as a nation deserving the right to govern themselves.  Literature = Writings and publication = Asdreni with his fellows Lasgush Poradeci, Ernest Koliqi and Gjergj Fishta. They are all among the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century. The literary career of Asdreni blossomed simultaneously with the beginning of the 20th century. In his first work, a collection of 99 poems known as the Rreze dielli dedicated to the Albanian national hero Skanderbeg who led a successful resistance to Ottoman expansion into Europe, he followed the literary traditions of Naim Frash√´ri and raised his love for the motherland encouraging his compatriots to enter the struggle for liberation from the Ottoman Empire. √ãndrra e lot√´, his second work also composed of 99 poems dedicated to Edith Durham who travelled extensively across Albania, is characterised by a wealth of poetic values. He instantly expressed his democratic values, his interests in societal problems at the time as well as his critical discourses on foreign domination. It was an important step from Romanticism towards Realism which was characterised by the historical time frame and reference, and writing about events and situations that happened in real life. His poem \\"K√´nga e bashkimit\\" (The Song of Unity), published in the volume √ãndrra [dh]e lot√´ (\\"Dreams and tears\\", 1912), is a clear adaptation of the Romanian song Hora Unirii by Vasile Alecsandri.Robert Elsie, Albanian literature: a short history, 2005, p. 104.

The party espoused Ba Ωathism (from Arabic ba Ωth meaning \\"renaissance\\" or \\"resurrection\\"), which is an ideology mixing Arab nationalist, pan-Arabism, Arab socialist, and anti-imperialist interests. Ba Ωathism calls for unification of the Arab world into a single state. Its motto, \\"Unity, Liberty, Socialism\\", refers to Arab unity, and freedom from non-Arab control and interference. The party was founded by the merger of the Arab Ba Ωath Movement, led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, and the Arab Ba Ωath, led by al-Arsuzi, on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba Ωath Party. The party quickly established branches in other Arab countries, although it would only hold power in Iraq and Syria. The Arab Ba Ωath Party merged with the Arab Socialist Movement, led by Akram al-Hawrani, in 1952 to form the Arab Socialist Ba Ωath Party. The newly formed party was a relative success, and became the second-largest party in the Syrian parliament in the 1954 election. This, coupled with the increasing strength of the Syrian Communist Party, led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria. The union would prove unsuccessful, and a Syrian coup in 1961 dissolved it. Following the break-up of the UAR, the Ba Ωath Party was reconstituted. However, during the UAR, military activists had established the Military Committee to take control of the Ba Ωath Party from civilian hands. In the meantime, in Iraq, the local Ba Ωath Party branch had taken power by orchestrating and leading the Ramadan Revolution, only to lose power a couple of months later. The Military Committee, with Aflaq's consent, took power in Syria in the 8th of March Revolution of 1963. A power struggle quickly developed between the civilian faction led by Aflaq, al-Bitar, and Munif al-Razzaz and the Military Committee led by Salah Jadid and Hafez al- Assad. As relations between the two factions deteriorated, the Military Committee initiated the 1966 Syrian coup d'√©tat, which ousted the National Command led by al-Razzaz, Aflaq, and their supporters. The 1966 coup split the Ba Ωath Party between the Iraqi-dominated Ba Ωath movement and the Syrian- dominated Ba Ωath movement. History The party was founded on 7 April 1947 as the Arab Ba'ath Party by Michel Aflaq (an Antiochian Christian), Salah al- Din al-Bitar (a Sunni Muslim), and the followers of Zaki al-Arsuzi (an atheist) in Damascus, Syria, leading to the establishment of the Syrian Regional Branch. Other regional branches were established throughout the Arab world in the later 1940s and early 1950s, in, among others, Iraq, Yemen and Jordan. Throughout its existence, the National Command (the body responsible for all-Arab affairs), gave most attention to Syrian affairs. The 2nd National Congress was convened in June 1954, and elected a seven-man National Command; Aflaq, Bitar, and Akram al-Hawrani were elected and represented the Syrian Regional Branch, while Abdullah Rimawi and Abdallah Na'was were elected to represent the Jordanian Branch. The congress is notable for sanctioning the merger of the Arab Socialist Movement and the Ba'ath Party, which took place in 1952. The Syrian Regional Branch rose to prominence in the 1940s and 1950s; in the 1954 parliamentary elections the Syrian Regional Branch won 22 seats in parliament, becoming the second largest party in the country. 90 percent of Ba'ath Party members who stood for elections were elected to parliament. The failure of the traditional parties represented by the People's Party and the National Party, strengthened the Ba'ath Party's public credibility. Through this position, the party was able to get two of its members into the cabinet; Bitar was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs and Khalil Kallas became Minister of Economics. Its new, strengthened position, was used successfully to garner support for Syria's merger with Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt, which led to the establishment of the United Arab Republic (UAR) in 1958. On 24 June 1959, Fuad al-Rikabi, the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Branch, accused the National Command of betraying Arab nationalist principles by conspiring against the UAR. In light of these criticisms, the Ba'ath convened the 3rd National Congress (held 27 August ‚Äì 1 September 1959), which was attended by delegates from \\"Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, South Arabia, the Gulf, Arab South, Arab Maghreb, Palestine and Party student organisations in Arab and other universities outside the [Arab] homeland\\". The congress is notable for endorsing the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch, which had been decided by Aflaq and Bitar without inner-party consultation in 1958, and for expelling Rimawi, the Regional Secretary of the Jordanian Regional Branch. Rimawi reacted to his expulsion by forming his own party, the Arab Socialist Revolutionary Ba'ath Party, which established a rival National Command to compete with the original. The National Command responded to the problems in Iraq by appointing a Temporary Regional Command on 2 February 1960, which appointed Talib El-Shibib as Regional Secretary, and on 15 June 1961 the National Command expelled Rikabi from the party. In Iraq, the Iraqi Regional Branch had supported Abd al-Karim Qasim's seizure of power and its ensuing abolishment of the Iraqi Monarchy. The Iraqi Ba'athists supported Qasim on the ground that they believed he would enter Iraq into the UAR, enlarging the Arab nationalist republic. However, this was proven to be a ruse, and after taking power Qasim launched an Iraq first policy. In retaliation, the Ba'ath Party tried to assassinate Qasim in February 1959, but the operation (which was led by a young Saddam Hussein) failed. Qasim was overthrown in the Ramadan Revolution led by young Ba'athist officer Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and rumoured to be supported by the American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Declassified documents and the testimony of former CIA officers indicate there was no direct American involvement, although the CIA had been previously notified of an earlier Ba'athist coup plot in July 1962 by a high-ranking informant within the Party. The CIA official working with Archie Roosevelt, Jr. on a separate plan to instigate a military coup against Qasim, and who later became the head of the CIA's operations in Iraq and Syria \\"from late 1968 to June 1970,\\" has \\"denied any involvement in the Ba'ath Party's actions.\\" The Iraqi Regional Branch, when it took power, was so riven by factionalism that its purported allies launched a counter-coup forcing them out of power in November 1963. The 4th National Congress, held in August 1960, criticized the leadership of Aflaq and Bitar, called for the reestablishment of the Syrian Regional Branch and deemphasized the party's commitment to Arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party. A year after, at the UAR's nadir in Syria, the Syrian General Abd al-Karim al- Nahlawi launched a coup on 28 September 1961, which led to the reestablishment of the Syrian Arab Republic. =Rule in Syria, infighting, the 1966 coup and split: 1963‚Äì1966= The challenges of building a Ba'athist state led to considerable ideological discussion and internal struggle within the party. The Iraqi Regional Branch was increasingly dominated by Ali Salih al-Sadi, a self-described Marxist. He was supported in his ideological reorientation by Hammud al-Shufi, the Regional Secretary of the Syrian Regional Branch, Yasin al-Hafiz, one of the party‚Äôs few ideological theorists, and by certain members of the secret Military Committee. The Marxist-wing gained new ground at the 6th National Congress (held in October 1963), in which the Iraqi and Syrian regional branches called for the establishment of \\"socialist planning\\", \\"collective farms run by peasants\\", \\"workers' democratic control of the means of production\\", and other demands reflecting a certain emulation of Soviet- style socialism. Aflaq, angry at this transformation of his party, retained a nominal leadership role, but the National Command as a whole came under the control of the radicals. In 1963 the Ba'ath Party seized power, from then on the Ba'ath functioned as the only officially recognized Syrian political party, but factionalism and splintering within the party led to a succession of governments and new constitutions. On 23 February 1966, a coup d'√©tat led by Salah Jadid, the informal head of the Military Committee, overthrew Aflaq and the Bitar's cabinet. The coup sprung out of factional rivalry between Jadid's \\"regionalist\\" (qutri) camp, which promoted ambitions for a Greater Syria and the more traditionally pan-Arab, in power faction, called the \\"nationalist\\" (qawmi) faction. Jadid's supporters are considered more left- wing then Aflaq and his peers. Several of Jadid's opponents managed to make their escape and fled to Beirut, Lebanon. Jadid moved the party in a more radical direction. Although he and his supporters had not been supporters of the victorious far-left line at the 6th Party Congress, they had now moved to adopt its positions. The moderate faction, formerly led by Aflaq and al-Bitar, were purged from the party. While it took some years, the 1966 coup resulted in the creation of two competing National Commands, one Syrian-dominated and another Iraqi-dominated. However, both in Iraq and Syria, the Regional Command became the real centre of party power, and the membership of the National Command became a largely honorary position, often the destination of figures being eased out of the leadership. A consequence of the split was that Zaki al-Arsuzi took Aflaq's place as the official father of Ba'athist thought in the pro-Syrian Ba'ath movement, while the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath movement still considered Aflaq the de jure father of Ba'athist thought. Organization The organizational structure of the Ba'ath Party was created at the 2nd National Congress by amending the party's Internal Regulations (), which was approved at the party's 1st National Congress in 1947. The organizational structure ran from top to bottom, and members were forbidden to initiate contacts between groups on the same level of the organisation‚Äîall contacts had to pass through a higher command level. =National organization= The National Command was the ruling organ of the party between sessions of the National Congress, and was headed by a Secretary-General. Between National Congresses, the National Command was held accountable by the National Consultative Council (Arabic: al- majlis al-istishari al-quami). The National Consultative Council was a forum made up of representatives from the party's regional branches. However, the number of National Consultative Council members were decided by the size of the regional branch. The National Congress elected the National Command, National Tribunal, the party's discipline body, and the Secretary-General, the party leader. The congress delegates determined the party's policies and procedures. Before 1954, the party was ruled by the Executive Committee, but this organ, along with others too, were replaced at the 2nd National Congress. In Ba'athist jargon \\"Nation\\" means the Arab Nation, because of that, the National Command formed the highest policy-making and coordinating council for the Ba'ath movement throughout the Arab world. The National Command had several bureaus, similar to those of the Regional Command. National Command sessions were held monthly. Of these, the National Liaisons Office was responsible for maintaining contact with the party's Regional Branches. =Regional organization= The term region reflected the Party's refusal to acknowledge them as separate nation-states. A \\"Region\\" (qu·π≠r), in Ba'athist parlance, is an Arab state such as Syria, Iraq, or Lebanon. The Regional Congress, which combined all the provincial branches, was the region's highest authority and elected a Regional Command, the party leadership in a specific region, the Regional Tribunal, the body responsible for discipline inspection, and a Regional Secretary, the regional party leader. The Regional Congress is made of delegates from the provincial branches; other members attended, but as observers. The Regional Congress was responsible for evaluating the party's performance since the last Regional Congress, while at the same time formulating new policies for the next period, which lasts until the next Regional Congress is held. How long this period lasts is decided by the Regional Command. The Regional Command, similar to the Branch Command, operated through bureaus and met for weekly-sessions. Below the Regional Commands there existed branches. The Branch came above the Subbranch; it comprised at least two to five subbranches, and operated at the provincial level. The branch held a congress periodically in which it elected a Command and a Secretary (leader). The Command operated through bureaus, such as the Workers Bureau and the Bureau of the Secretariat for instance. Underneath the branch was the Subbranch, which was made up of three to five sections, \\"and was the lowest level of the party to hold a periodical Congress.\\" Some subbranches were independent of central authority, and elected their own Command and secretaries, while other subbranches were incorporated into the Branches. In these cases the Subbranch Secretary is appointed by the superior Branch. A Section, which comprised two to five Divisions, functioned at the level of a large city quarter, a town, or a rural district. It elected its own Command, composed of five members, but the Subbranch appointed the Command's secretary. Below that there existed divisions. A division comprised two to seven Circles, controlled by a Division Commander. Such Ba'athist groups occurred throughout the bureaucracy and the military. They functioned as the Party‚Äôs watchdog and were an effective form of covert surveillance within a public administration. The lowest level was the circle. It was composed of three to seven members, constituted the basic organizational unit. The Military Organization was made up of branches similar to those in the Ba'ath's civilian sector. However, unlike the civilian sector the Military Organization was controlled by a separate Military Bureau, and held periodical Military Congresses. The Military Organization and the Civilian Organization converged at the Regional Congress. =Membership= There existed three types of membership categories in the Ba'ath Party; Active member (Arabic: udw √§mil), Apprentice Member (Arabic: udw mutadarrib) and Supporter (Arabic: firqa). An Active member had to attend all formal meetings of his party unit, was given the right to vote in party elections, and could run for party office. In the Syrian Regional Branch a member had to spend 18 months as a Supporter to be promoted to Apprentice status, and then wait another 18 months to be promoted to Active member status. Ideology and policy=Classical Ba'ath: 1947‚Äì1960=Arab Nation Part of the 1947 Ba'ath Party constitution From its very beginning, the party was a manifestation of Arab nationalist thought, with the party itself referring to itself as \\"The Party of Arab Unity\\". The pan-Arab tendencies of the party's predecessor, the Arab Ba'ath Movement, was strengthened 1945‚Äì1947 by recruiting members from the Zaki al- Arsuzi's Arab Ba'ath. The first article of the party's constitution stated \\"the Arabs form one nation. This nation has the natural right to live in a single state. [As such,] the Arab fatherland constitutes an indivisible political and economic unit. No Arab can live apart from the others.\\" To express his heartfelt belief in Arab nationalism, Aflaq coined the term \\"one Arab nation with an eternal message\\" (). Party ideology, and Ba'athism in general, was not based on concepts such as the purity of the Arab race or ethnic chauvinism, but on idealistic thoughts borrowed from the enlightenment era. According to Middle East expert Tabitha Petran, the basic idea of the party's ideology was; > that the Arab nation is a permanent entity in history. The Arab nation is > considered, philosophically speaking, not as a social and economic > formation, but as a transcendent fact inspiring different forms, one of its > highest contributions taking the form of Islam. It was not Islam that > modeled the peoples of Arabia, the Fertile Crescent, and North Africa, > equipping them with Islamic values, especially the Arabic language and the > Arabic culture, but the Arab nation which created Islam. This conception of > the Arab nation implicitly advantages the Arab contribution to history. On > the other hand, Arab decadence can be overcome through a purifying and > spiritual action, not religious but moral.\\" Peasant and workers The early Ba'ath gave little attention to the problems facing the peasants and workers. As Hanna Batatu notes, \\"Aflaq was basically urban in outlook. The peasants never constituted an object of his special concern. In his writing there is scarcely an expression of concentrated interest in the country's husbandsmen.\\" While peasants and issues facing them are mentioned in some of Aflaq's work, there was scarcely any depth given to them or the issues facing them. To take an example, in one instance Aflaq states \\"the [national struggle] ... can only be based on the generality of the Arabs and these will not take part in it if they are exploited.\\" Secondly, Aflaq never had any official enmity towards the traditional landlords. Issues such as these would only gain prominence when Akram al-Hawrani became a leading party figure, and when the \\"transitional Ba'athists\\" took power. Of the four members in the 1st Executive Committee, Wahib al-Ghanim was the only who paid much attention to the problems of the peasants and workers, because the other members (Aflaq, Salah al-Din al-Bitar and Jalil al-Sayyide) had a middle class upbringing and upheld middle class values. The early party organization never cultivated a deep following in rural areas. In fact, at the party's founding congress, only one peasant and one worker were present among the 217 delegates. Most of the delegates were either school teacher or students attending universities. When the Akram al- Hawrani's Arab Socialist Party (ASP) merged with the Ba'ath Party, the majority of ASP members of peasants origins did not join the Ba'ath Party, instead becoming personal followers of Hawrani. However, the majority of Ba'ath members were of rural upbringing. The \\"Transitional Ba'ath\\", which grew out of the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958 dissolution and the Military Committee, were more rural in outlook, policy and ideology. \\"Unity, liberty, socialism\\" The slogan \\"Unity, liberty, socialism\\" is the key tenet in Ba'athist thought. Unity stood for the creation of an independent, strong Arab Nation. Liberty did not mean liberal democracy, but rather freedom from colonial oppression and freedom of speech and thought. Aflaq believed that the Ba'ath Party, at least in theory, would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people, however he did support intra-party democracy. The last tenet, 'socialism', did not mean socialism as it is defined in the West, but rather a unique form of Arab socialism. According to Ba'athist thought, socialism had originated under the rule of Muhammad. The original interpretation of Arab socialism did not answer questions such as: how much state control was necessary, or economic equality; but instead focused on freeing the Arab Nation and its people from colonization and oppression in general. =Transitional Ba'ath: 1960‚Äì1964=Regionalists versus nationalists After the failure of the United Arab Republic (UAR), a union of Egypt and Syria, the Ba'ath Party was divided into two main factions, the Regionalists () and the Nationalists (pan-Arab) (). When the union with Egypt collapsed, the Ba'ath Party was put in a difficult position, the party still sought Arab unity, but did not oppose the UAR's dissolution and did not want to seek another union with Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser's rule. However, being the unionist party that it was, the party's leaders could not state their position on this issue. The end result was that the pro-Arab nationalists within the Ba'ath Party became committed Nasserists, while the more moderate Arab nationalists founded the pro-Nasserite Socialist Unionists party. The third group, led by people disenchanted with both Nasser and the union period, remained in the Ba'ath Party, stopped believing in the feasibility pan- Arabism. on 21 February 1962, the National Command issued a new policy regarding the pan-Arab project by first mentioning the successes and failures of the UAR, but ending the statement by calling for the reestablishment of the UAR as a decentralized federal union with Nasser's Egypt. Many rank-and-file members opposed this change in policy, with many members being both disenchanted with pan-Arabism and Aflaq's continued party rule. When the Syrian Regional Branch was reestablished, the majority of its members in the provinces were of communal origins‚ÄìDruze, Alawi or Ismaili. The provincial party members had not been told of the Syrian Regional Branch's dissolution, which in fact broke the communication line with provincial branches and the National Command. While its true that in 1962 the Regionalists supported the slogan, adopted at the 5th National Congress, \\"the renewal of the union with Egypt while taking note of past mistakes\\", they treated such a slogan as a propaganda slogan, and not as a feasible goal. The \\"Arab road to socialism\\" The disillusionment felt among party members on the pan-Arab project, led to the radicalization of the party's interpretation of socialism. Yasin al-Hafiz, a former member of the Syrian Communist Party, was an early frontrunner for the party's radicalization. While he didn't oppose the pan- Arab project, he wanted to turn the concept of Arab socialism into a scientific and revolutionary socialist ideology which adapted Marxism to local conditions. Jamal al-Atassi, who had been a moderate socialist for most of his life, called for the renunciation of Arab socialism in 1963 and the adoption of a \\"virtually Marxist concept of socialism\\" by claiming that class struggle was the moving force in society. Hammud al-Shufi became the leader of the party's Marxist faction during his short stint as Syrian Regional Secretary, literally the head of the Syrian Regional Organization. Shufi was able, due to his position as head of the Organization Bureau of the Regional Command, to recruit several Marxist or Marxist-leaning members to the top of the Syrian Regional party hierarchy. Radical socialists led by Ali Salih al-Sadi took control of the Iraqi Regional Branch in 1963, which led to the official radicalization of the party's ideology. The delegates at the 6th National Congress elected an Ideology Committee that was responsible for writing a charter about the party's ideology. The end result was the document Points of Departure. The document, which was approved by the 6th National Congress, relegated Arab unity to a secondary role and gave socialism prominence. Marxist concepts were used interchangeably alongside Ba'athist ones; however, the document was reluctant in explicitly admitting that certain ideas were of Marxist origins. While the Points of Departure didn't create a break with the party's traditional ideology, it criticized the party's old guard for giving Arab unity primacy over socialism and their failure to turn Ba'athism into a comprehensive theory. While the documents says Arab unity is progressive, the reason for it being important changed. The document stated: \\"Arab unity is an indispensable basis for the construction of a socialist economy.\\" Aflaq also believed that Arab unity was only an intermediate goal, but it stood at the centre of classical Ba'athism. In the Points of Departure, despite not firmly stating it, the goal of creating a socialist society seemed to be both an immediate goal and the main goal of the party. The concept of Arab socialism, accused of being narrow-minded and nationalistic, was replaced with the \\"Arab road to socialism\\" concept. The Points of Departure criticized the classical Ba'athist view regarding private ownership. Classical Ba'athists supported private ownership as a way to recruit into the party many petty bourgeois elements. The document called for nationalization of the commanding heights of the economy, the slow incorporation of the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist economy and the elimination of the national bourgeoisie and its allied classes. To safeguard the party from evolving into one supporting state capitalism, the socialist economy would be controlled by a vanguard party together with popular participation from the toiler masses. =Neo-Ba'ath: 1964‚Äì1966= Neo-Ba'athism is the dramatic changes that manifested in Ba'athist ideology from 1960 to 1964, and the Military Committee's takeover of the Syrian Regional Branch and the National Command in the period 1964 to 1966. The 6th National Congress signified the takeover of the party by an anti-militarist left, which opposed both the traditional leaders in the National Command and the pragmatists in the Military Committee. When the anti- military left called for popular democracy, no involvement of the military in national politics and popular struggle, the Military Committee became concerned. By 1965 the anti-military leftists began to \\"spread rumors about the rightist character of the military junta [Military Committee] within the party and their subversive efforts to engulf it. There was not a single officer in the party who was not accused of conspiracy and reactionary tendencies.\\" In collaboration with the National Command the Military Committee succeeded in expelling the anti-military left from the party at the 7th National Congress. The Military Committee, which now controlled the Syrian Regional Branch, took control of the Ba'ath Party in the coup of 1966. According to Middle East expert Avraham Ben-Tzur \\"the [neo-]Ba'th in its latest variant is a bureaucratic apparatus headed by the military, whose daily life and routine are shaped by the rigid military oppression on the home front, and [Soviet aid among others] military aid.\\" Regional branches=Iraq= Fuad al-Rikabi founded the Iraqi Regional Branch in 1951 or 1952. There are those who trace the branch's founding to Abd ar Rahman ad Damin and Abd al Khaliq al Khudayri in 1947, after their return from the 1st National Congress, which was held in Syria. Another version is that the branch was established in 1948 by Rikabi and Sa'dun Hamadi, a Shia Muslim. However, Efraim Karsh and Inari Rautsi contend that the Regional Branch was established in the 1940s, but that it received official recognition as a Regional Branch of the Ba'ath Party in 1952 by the National Command. What is certain is that Rikabi was elected the Regional Branch's first Regional Secretary in 1952. The party initially consisted of a majority of Shia Muslims, as Rikabi recruited supporters mainly from his friends and family, but slowly became Sunni dominated. The Regional Branch, and other parties of pan-Arab inclination, had difficulties in recruiting Shia members. Most Shi'ites considered pan-Arab ideology as a Sunni project, since the majority of Arabs are Sunnis. At the time of 14 July Revolution in 1958, which overthrew the Hashemite monarchy, the Regional Branch had 300 members. The Iraqi Regional Branch supported Abd al-Karim Qasim's rule on the grounds that he would seek Iraq's entry into the United Arab Republic. Of the 16-members of Qasim's cabinet, 12 of them were Regional Branch members. After taking power, Qasim's change his position on the UAR, reverting to the old \\"Iraq first policy\\". This turn displeased the Regional Branch and other Arab nationalists groups. Because of his policy reversal, the Regional Branch gathered a group, led by Saddam Hussein, which tried but failed to assassinate Qasim. The Regional Branch seized power in the Ramadan Revolution. The coup was led by leading Regional Branch member Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. The plotters appointed Abdul Salam Arif, a Nasserite, to the Presidency while al-Bakr was appointed the country's Prime Minister. However, real power was in the hands of Ali Salih al-Sadi, the branch's Regional Secretary. After taking power, the Regional Branch through its militia, the National Guard, initiated what Iraqi expert Con Coughlin referred to as an \\"orgy of violence\\" against communist and left-wing elements. These repressive measures coupled with factionalism within the Regional Branch led to the November 1963 Iraqi coup d'√©tat by President Arif and his Nasserite supporters. Iraq expert Malik Mufti believes Aflaq may have supported Arif's coup because it weakened al-Sadi's position within the party and strengthened his own. The coup forced the branch to go underground. Because of the coup, several leading Ba'athist were jailed, such as al-Bakr and Saddam. Despite this, the Regional Branch elected al-Bakr as Regional Secretary in 1964. =Jordan= Following the party's establishment in Syria, Ba'athist ideas spread throughout the Arab world. In Jordan Ba'athist thought first spread to the East Bank in the late-1940s, most notably at universities. While the Regional Branch was not formed until 1951, several meetings took place at the universities where students and professors alike would discuss the Ba'athist thought. Despite the ideology being very popular, it took time before the actual Regional Branch was established. A group of teachers established the Regional Branch in the city by Al-Karak. At the very beginning, the clinic owned by Abd al-Rahman Shuqyar was used as the branch's meeting place. Bahjat Abu Gharbiyah became the Regional Branch's first member in the West Bank, and was thus resigned the responsibility of building the party's organization in the area the branch secretary in the West Bank, and was thus responsible in that area. In the West Bank, the branch was most active in the cities of Jerusalem and Ramallah. The 1st Regional Congress was held in 1951 in the home of Abdullah Rimawi. The congress mapped out the \\"future course of the party\\". The next year, the 2nd Regional Congress was held, this time in Abdallah Na'was' home. It elected a Regional Command and appointed Rimawi as the branch's Regional Secretary. Shugyar, Gharbiyah and Na'was agreed to serve in the Regional Branch's Central Committee. Rimawi and Na'was, his deputy, would prove effective leaders. Shortly after the 2nd Regional Congress, the branch launched a successful recruitment campaign in Jordanian and Palestinian neighbourhoods and cities. On 28 August 1956 the branch was legalized by a High Court. Both Rimawi and Na'was were elected to Parliament in the 1950 and 1951 elections as independents (the branch was not a legal party at the time). In the 1951 election, the branch managed to elect three members to parliament. Rimawi was able to retain his seat in parliament until the 1956 election. None of these elections can be considered democratic. Shuqyar, during the 1951 elections, was imprisoned by the authorities because his views were deemed to radical. Less than a month before the election day, the British Embassy in Amman had estimated that Shuqyar would gain an easy victory. However, because of the undemocratic nature of the election, Shuqyar was not elected. As voting patterns would prove, voters who voted for Ba'athist candidates lived in Irbid and Amman on the East Bank, and Jerusalem and Nablus on the West Bank. Shuqyar during a government-imposed exile to Southern Jordan, used his spare time reading Marxist and Leninist literature. While he never became a communist, Shuqyar began to support communist concepts. On his return from exile he tried to persuade the Regional Branch to join in an electoral front with the Jordanian Communist Party. However, the Regional Branch leaders Rimawi, Na'was, Gharbiyah and Munif al-Razzaz opposed such an idea, and because of it, Shuqyar left the Ba'ath Party. Rimawi and Na'was were elected to the National Command at the 2nd National Congress (held in 1952). At the 6th and 7th National Congress, the Regional Branch elected Razzaz to the National Command. =Lebanon= The Lebanese Regional Branch was formed in 1949‚Äì1950. During the existence of the UAR, the Regional Branch was split into two factions, those supporting Nasser and those opposing him. However, in April 1960, the UAR denied the Regional Branch organ As Sahaf√§h access into the UAR-ruled Syria. The Regional Branch was strongest in the city of Tripoli. In the 1960 elections, Abd al-Majid al-Rafei was just a few votes short of being elected to parliament. However, a persistent problem for him during his election campaign was the vocal criticism of him and the Regional Branch by the Lebanese Communist Party. In Tripoli the Communists supported the candidacy of Rashid Karami, to ensure themselves of a Regional Branch victory. On 17 July 1961 a group of rival Ba'athists led by Rimawi opened fire on several of the Regional Branch's members. During the UAR years, the same factional lines that developed in the Syrian Regional Branch came to the Lebanese Regional Branch. At the 4th National Congress (held in Lebanon), which was mainly attended by delegates representing Lebanon, several resolutions with a pronounced anti- Nasser tone were approved. At the same time, criticism of Aflaq and Bitar was severe, both their leadership records and their ideology were criticized. A resolution was approved, which stated that the party leaders [Aflaq, al-Bitar among others had to hastily entered into a union with Egypt, had wrongly dissolved the Syrian Regional Branch in 1958, given pan-Arabism primacy when socialism was the more important, the need to use Marxist, not Ba'athi, tools to analyze the current situation and the need for the party to strengthen their positions amongst the popular classes‚Äìthe workers, peasants, artisans and shopkeepers. Because of the position of the Lebanese Regional Branch, Aflaq at the 5th National Congress invited enough Iraqi Regional Branch delegates to neutralize the Lebanese delegates. However, at the same time, the Lebanese Regional Branch opposed Hawrani and his faction. At the 6th National Congress, the Lebanese Regional Branch elected Jubr√§n Majdalani and Khalid al- Ali to the National Command. At the 7th National Congress the National Command in collaboration with the Military Committee either expelled or removed leftists such as those found in the Lebanese Regional Branch from leadership position, and in the most severe cases, expelled them from the party. The Lebanese Regional Branch managed to elect three members to the National Command at the 7th National Congress; Majdalani, al-Ali and Abd al-Majid Rafi. =Libya= The Regional Branch was founded in the 1950s by Amr Taher Deghayes. Ba'athism was a major political force in Libya following the establishment of the United Arab Republic. Many intellectuals were attracted to Ba'athist ideology during the later years of the Kingdom of Libya. However, with help from Nasserist propaganda, several Ba'athists changed affiliation and became Nasserists instead. The growth of these pan-Arab ideologies concerned the government, which led to the incarceration of several Nasserist and Ba'athist military officers in the early sixties. The Ba'athist were accused of working to overthrow \\"the political, economic and social system\\" of the Kingdom; the sentences ranged from everything to eight months to two years. By 1964, the Libyan Regional Branch had only managed to establish one- level below the Regional Command, the branch-level. Syrian specialist John Devlin estimated that the Libyan Regional Branch had been 50 and 150 members in 1964. =Syria= Syrian politics took a dramatic turn in 1954 when the military government of Adib Shishakli was overthrown and the democratic system restored. The Ba'ath, now a large and popular organisation, won 15 out of 142 parliamentary seats in the Syrian election that year, becoming the second- largest party in parliament. Aside from the Syrian Communist Party (SCP), the Ba'ath Party was the only party able to organise mass protests among workers. The party was supported by the intelligentsia due to their pro-Egyptian and anti-imperialist stance along with their advocation of social reform. The Ba'ath faced considerable competition from ideological competitors, notably the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP), which supported the establishment of a Greater Syria. The Ba'ath Party's main adversary was the SCP, whose support for class struggle and internationalism was anathema to the Ba'ath. In addition to parliamentary-level competition, all these parties (as well as Islamists) competed in street-level activity and sought to recruit support among the military. By the end of 1957, the SCP was able to weaken the Ba'ath Party to such an extent that the Ba'ath Party drafted a bill in December that called for a union with Egypt, a move that proved to be very popular. The Ba'ath leadership dissolved the party in 1958, gambling that the illegalisation of certain parties would hurt the SCP more than it would the Ba'ath. Akram al-Hawrani (left) with Michel Aflaq, 1957. A military coup in Damascus in 1961 brought the UAR to an end. Sixteen prominent politicians signed a statement supporting the coup, among them al-Hawrani and Salah al-Din al-Bitar (who later retracted his signature). Following the UAR's dissolution, the Ba'ath Party was reestablished at the 1962 congress. The Military Committee did not show itself to the civilian wing of the party at this congress. During the congress, Aflaq and the Military Committee, through Muhammad Umran, made contact for the first time; the committee asked for permission to initiate a coup d'√©tat; Aflaq supported the conspiracy. Following the success of the Ramadan Revolution, led by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi Regional Branch, the Military Committee hastily convened to hatch a coup against Nazim al-Kudsi's presidency. The 8 March Revolution proved successful, and a Ba'athist government in Syria was established. The plotters first order was to establish the National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), consisting entirely of Ba'athists and Nasserists, and controlled by military personnel rather than civilians from the very beginning. While the Ba'ath Party had attained power, there was a problem; internal infighting. The Military Committee, which was itself a tiny minority of the already small Ba'ath Party membership, was forced to rule by force. The Ba'ath Party had only 2,500 members by mid-1963, the party lacked a popular base. Even if membership expanded, the authoritarian way of ruling it had introduced when coming to power would get worse, not better. Another problem was that the civilian wing was riven by infighting between the radical socialist and moderate faction, while the military stood more unified. Whatever the case, the Syrian Regional Command slowly amassed its powers by weakening the National Command. This all came to a head in the 1966 Syrian coup d'√©tat. =Others= Following the Ba'ath Party's founding, regional branches were established in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Not long after it established branches in North Yemen and South Yemen. In Tunisia, a Regional Branch was established in the 1950s, but was forced underground for much of its existence. The Saudi Regional Branches elected Ali Ghann√§m to represent them at the 7th National Command. While its currently unknown which side the Saudi Ba'ath took after the 1966 split, it published a newspaper, Sawt al-Tal‚Äòiyya, from 1973 to 1980. It was an ardent critic of the Saudi royal family and American imperialism. The majority of its members were Shia Muslims. In late 1963, Ba'ath cells were being established in Sudan, and there were even rumours that a Ba'ath cell had been established in Egypt.

While at Harvard, Damon wrote an early treatment of the screenplay Good Will Hunting as an exercise for an English class for which he later received an Academy Award.\\"Oscar joins the family\\" Irene Sege, The Boston Globe March 25, 1998 He was a member of the Delphic Club, one of Harvard's select Final Clubs. In 2013, he was awarded the Harvard Arts Medal.\\"Matt Damon on His Craft\\" Colleen Walsh, The Harvard Gazette April 25, 2013  Career = Acting = Damon and right Damon entered Harvard in 1988,\\"Oscar winner Matt Damon on his Harvard years \\", Harvard Gazette, August 6, 2013 where he appeared in student theater plays, such as Burn This and A... My Name is Alice. Later, he made his film debut at the age of 18, with a single line of dialogue in the romantic comedy Mystic Pizza. As a student at Harvard, he acted in small roles such as in the TNT original film Rising Son and the ensemble prep-school drama School Ties. He left the university in 1992, a semester - 12 credits - shy of completion of his Bachelor of Arts in English to feature in Geronimo: An American Legend in Los Angeles, erroneously expecting the movie to become a big success. Damon next appeared as an opiate-addicted soldier in 1996's Courage Under Fire, for which he lost in 100 days on a self-prescribed diet and fitness regimen. Courage Under Fire gained him critical notice, when The Washington Post labeled his performance \\"impressive\\". During the early 1990s, Damon and Affleck wrote Good Will Hunting (1997), a screenplay about a young mathematics genius, an extension of a screenplay he wrote for an assignment at Harvard, having integrated advice from director Rob Reiner, screenwriter William Goldman, and writer/director Kevin Smith. He asked Affleck to perform the scenes with him in front of the class and, when Damon later moved into Affleck's Los Angeles apartment, they began working on the script more seriously. The film, which they wrote mainly during improvisation sessions, was set partly in their hometown of Cambridge, and drew from their own experiences. They sold the screenplay to Castle Rock in 1994, but after a conflict with the company, they convinced Miramax to purchase the script. The film received critical praise; Quentin Curtis of The Daily Telegraph found \\"real wit and vigour, and some depth\\" in their writing and Emanuel Levy of Variety wrote of Damon's acting, \\"[he] gives a charismatic performance in a demanding role that's bound to catapult him to stardom. Perfectly cast, he makes the aching, step-by-step transformation of Will realistic and credible.\\" It received nine Academy Awards nominations, including Best Actor for Damon; he and Affleck won Oscars and Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. He and Affleck were each paid salaries of $600,000, while the film grossed over $225 million at the worldwide box office. The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith's 2001 movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. left Speaking of his \\"overnight success\\" through Good Will Hunting, Damon said by that time he had been working in the cinema for 11 years, but still found the change \\"nearly indescribable‚Äîgoing from total obscurity to walking down a street in New York and having everybody turn and look\\". Before the film, Damon played the lead in the critically acclaimed drama, The Rainmaker (1997), where he was recognized by the Los Angeles Times as \\"a talented young actor on the brink of stardom.\\" For the role, Damon gained most of the weight he had lost for Courage Under Fire. After meeting Damon on the set of Good Will Hunting, director Steven Spielberg cast him in the brief title role in the 1998 World War II film Saving Private Ryan. He co-starred with Edward Norton in the 1998 poker film Rounders, where he plays a reformed gambler in law school who must return to playing big stakes poker to help a friend pay off loan sharks. Despite meager earnings at the box-office, the film has developed a cult status over the years. Damon then portrayed antihero Tom Ripley in The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), a role for which he lost . Damon said that he wanted to display his character's humanity and honesty on screen despite his criminal actions. An adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's 1955 novel of same name, the film costarred Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cate Blanchett, and received praise from critics. \\"Damon outstandingly conveys his character's slide from innocent enthusiasm into cold calculation\\", according to Variety magazine. He played a fallen angel who discusses pop culture as intellectual subject matter with Affleck in Dogma (1999). The film received generally positive reviews, but proved controversial among religious groups who deemed it blasphemous. Damon's attempts at essaying leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000's All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance were commercially and critically unsuccessful. Variety said of his work in All the Pretty Horses: \\"[Damon] just doesn't quite seem like a young man who's spent his life amidst the dust and dung of a Texas cattle ranch. Nor does he strike any sparks with [Penelope] Cruz.\\" He was similarly deemed \\"uncomfortable being the center\\" of Robert Redford's The Legend of Bagger Vance by Peter Rainer of New York magazine. Damon and 231x231px During this period, Damon joined two lucrative film series‚ÄîOcean's Trilogy (2001‚Äì2007) and Bourne (2002‚Äì2016)‚Äîand produced the television series Project Greenlight (2001‚Äì2005, 2015).

Damon said that before The Bourne Identity he was jobless for six months, and many of his films during that period under-performed at the box-office. He doubted on the film's financial prospects, but it proved a commercial success. Reviews for the film were also positive; Roger Ebert praised it for its ability to absorb the viewer in its \\"spycraft\\" and \\"Damon's ability to be focused and sincere\\". For his role, Entertainment Weekly named Damon among \\"the decade's best mixer of brawn and brains.\\" Damon voiced the role of Spirit in the animated film Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron (2002) and later played a conjoined twin in Stuck on You (2003), which received a mixed critical reception. His major releases in 2004 included starring roles in the sequels The Bourne Supremacy and Ocean's Twelve. Both films earned more than $280 million at the box- office. In a review for The Bourne Supremacy, BBC's Nev Pierce called the film \\"a brisk, engrossing and intelligent thriller\\", adding, \\"Damon is one hell of an action hero. He does a lot with very little, imbuing his limited dialogue with both rage and sorrow, looking harder and more haunted as the picture progresses\\". For the film, he earned an Empire Award for Best Actor; the award's presenter Empire attributed Damon's win to his \\"astute, underplayed performance, through which he totally eschews movie star vanity\\". He played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm alongside Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam's fantasy adventure The Brothers Grimm (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure; The Washington Post concluded, \\"Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster's teeth and flaunting a fake, 'Masterpiece Theatre' dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of The Pirates of Penzance.\\" Damon in 2009 Later in 2005, he appeared as an energy analyst in the geopolitical thriller Syriana alongside George Clooney and Jeffrey Wright. The film focuses on petroleum politics and the global influence of the oil industry. Damon says starring in the film broadened his understanding of the oil industry and that he hoped the people would talk about the film afterward. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was mainly impressed with Clooney's acting, but also found Damon's performance \\"whiplash\\". In 2006, Damon joined Robert De Niro in The Good Shepherd as a career CIA officer, and played an undercover mobster working for the Massachusetts State Police in Martin Scorsese's The Departed, a remake of the Hong Kong police thriller Infernal Affairs. Assessing his work in the two films, Manohla Dargis of The New York Times wrote that Damon has the unique \\"ability to recede into a film while also being fully present, a recessed intensity, that distinguishes how he holds the screen.\\" The Departed received critical acclaim and won the Academy Award for Best Picture. According to Forbes in August 2007, Damon was the most bankable star of the actors reviewed, his last three films at that time averaged US$29 at the box office for every dollar he earned.

His next role was Steven Soderbergh's dark comedy The Informant!

Apart from a brief period of ministerial office during the Labour government of 1929‚Äì31, he spent his political life campaigning against established authority and vested interests, his main causes being the promotion of social justice, women's rights and world disarmament. Originally a radical Liberal, Lansbury became a socialist in the early 1890s, and thereafter served his local community in the East End of London in numerous elective offices. His activities were underpinned by his Christian beliefs which, except for a short period of doubt, sustained him through his life. Elected to Parliament in 1910, he resigned his seat in 1912 to campaign for women's suffrage, and was briefly imprisoned after publicly supporting militant action. In 1912, Lansbury helped to establish the Daily Herald newspaper, and became its editor. Throughout the First World War the paper maintained a strongly pacifist stance, and supported the October 1917 Russian Revolution. These positions contributed to Lansbury's failure to be elected to Parliament in 1918. He devoted himself to local politics in his home borough of Poplar, and went to prison with 30 fellow- councillors for his part in the Poplar \\"rates revolt\\" of 1921. After his return to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour government of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929‚Äì31. After the political and economic crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to rearmament in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament. Early life=East End upbringing= Plaque on the assumed birthplace of George Lansbury in Haleswoth, Suffolk. It incorrectly records Lansbury's death year as 1947. George Lansbury was born in Halesworth in the county of Suffolk on 22 February 1859. He was the third of nine children born to a railway worker, also named George Lansbury, and Anne Lansbury (n√©e Ferris). George senior's job involved the supervision of railway construction gangs; the family was often on the move, and living conditions were primitive. Through his progressive-minded mother and grandmother, young George became familiar with the names of great contemporary reformers‚ÄîGladstone, Richard Cobden and John Bright‚Äîand began to read the radical Reynolds's Newspaper. By the end of 1868, the family had moved into London's East End, the district in which Lansbury would live and work for almost all his life.Postgate, p. 5 The essayist Ronald Blythe has described the East End of the 1860s and 1870s as \\"stridently English ... The smoke-blackened streets were packed with illiterate multitudes [who] stayed alive through sheer birdlike ebullience\\".Blythe, p. 272 Interspersed with spells of work, Lansbury attended schools in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel. He then held a succession of manual jobs, including work as a coaling contractor in partnership with his elder brother, James, loading and unloading coal wagons. This was heavy and dangerous work, and led to at least one near-fatal accident.Shepherd 2002, pp. 8‚Äì9 During his adolescence and early adulthood, Lansbury was a regular attender at the public gallery at the House of Commons, where he heard and remembered many of Gladstone's speeches on the main foreign policy issue of the day, the \\"Eastern Question\\". He was present at the riots which erupted outside Gladstone's house on 24 February 1878 after a peace meeting in Hyde Park.Lansbury, pp. 40‚Äì43 Shepherd writes that Gladstone's Liberalism, proclaiming liberty, freedom and community interests was \\"a heady mix that left an indelible mark\\" on the youthful Lansbury.Shepherd 2002, pp. 10‚Äì11 George Lansbury senior died in 1875. That year young George met fourteen-year- old Elizabeth Brine, whose father Isaac Brine owned a local sawmill. The couple eventually married in 1880, at Whitechapel parish church, where the vicar, J. Franklin Kitto, had been Lansbury's spiritual guide and counsellor. Apart from a period of doubt in the 1890s when he temporarily rejected the Church, Lansbury remained a staunch Anglican until his death.Postgate, pp. 13‚Äì20 =Australia= Migrants disembarking from a ship in Brisbane, c. 1885 In 1881, the first of Lansbury's twelve children, Bessie, was born; another daughter, Annie, followed in 1882. Seeking to improve his family's prospects, Lansbury decided that their best hopes of prosperity lay in emigrating to Australia. The London agent-general for Queensland depicted a land of boundless opportunities, with work for all; seduced by this appeal, Lansbury and Bessie raised the necessary passage money, and in May 1884 set sail with their children for Brisbane.Postgate, pp. 22‚Äì23 On the outward passage, the family experienced illness, discomfort and danger; on one occasion the ship came close to foundering during a monsoon. On arrival at Brisbane in July 1884, Lansbury found that contrary to the London agent's promises, there was a superfluity of labour and work was hard to come by. His first job, breaking stone, proved to be too physically punishing; he moved to a better-paid position as a van driver, but was sacked when, for religious reasons, he refused to work on Sundays.Postgate, pp. 24‚Äì29 He then contracted to work on a farm some 80 miles inland, to find upon arrival that his employer had misled him about living conditions and terms of employment.Shepherd 2002, pp. 13‚Äì15 For several months, the Lansbury family lived in extreme squalor before Lansbury secured release from the contract. Back in Brisbane, he worked for a while at the newly built Brisbane cricket ground. As a keen follower of the game he hoped to see the visiting English touring team play but, as Lansbury's biographer Raymond Postgate records, \\"he learned that cricket watching was not a pleasure for workmen\\". Throughout his tenure in Australia, Lansbury sent letters home, revealing the truth about conditions facing immigrants. To a friend he wrote in March 1885: \\"Mechanics are not wanted. Farm labourers are not wanted ... Hundreds of men and women are not able to get work ... The streets are foul day and night, and if I had a sister I would shoot her dead rather than see her brought out to this little hell on earth\\". In May 1885, having received from Isaac Brine sufficient funds for a passage home, the Lansbury family left Australia for good. Radical Liberal=First campaigns= On his return to London, Lansbury took a job in Brine's timber business. In his spare time he campaigned against the false prospectuses offered by colonial emigration agents. His speech at an emigration conference at King's College in London in April 1886 impressed delegates; shortly afterwards, the government established an Emigration Information Bureau under the Colonial Office. This body was required to provide accurate information on the state of labour markets in all the government's overseas possessions.Shepherd 2002, pp. 16‚Äì17 Having joined the Liberal Party shortly after his return from Australia, Lansbury became first a ward secretary and then general secretary for the Bow and Bromley Liberal and Radical Association.Postgate, p. 31 His effective campaigning skills had been noted by leading Liberals, including Samuel Montagu, the Liberal MP for Whitechapel, who persuaded the young activist to be his agent in the 1885 general election.Shepherd 2002, pp. 19‚Äì20 Lansbury's handling of this election campaign prompted Montagu to urge him to stand for parliament himself.Lansbury, p. 75 Lansbury declined this, partly on practical grounds (MPs were then unpaid and he had to provide for his family), and partly on principle; he was becoming increasingly convinced that his future lay not as a radical Liberal but as a socialist. He continued to serve the Liberals, as an agent and local secretary, while expressing his socialism in a short-lived monthly radical journal, Coming Times, which he founded and co-edited with a fellow-dissident, William Hoffman.Schneer 1990, pp. 16‚Äì17 =London County Council elections, 1889= The Metropolitan Board of Works building in Spring Gardens near Trafalgar Square, original headquarters of the London County Council In 1888 Lansbury agreed to act as election agent for Jane Cobden, who was contesting the first elections for the newly formed London County Council (LCC) as Liberal candidate for the Bow and Bromley division.Schneer (\\"Politics and Feminism\\"), p. 67 Cobden, an early supporter of women's suffrage, was the fourth child of the Victorian radical statesman Richard Cobden. The Society for Promoting Women as County Councillors (SPWCC), a new women's rights group, had proposed Cobden as the candidate for Bow and Bromley and Margaret Sandhurst for Brixton. Lansbury counselled Cobden in the issues of greatest concern to the East End electorate: housing for the poor, ending of sweated labour, rights of public assembly, and control of the police. Specific questions of women's rights were largely avoided during the campaign.Schneer (\\"Politics and Feminism\\"), p. 68 On 19 January 1889 both women were elected; these triumphs were, however, short-lived. Sandhurst's qualification to serve as a county councillor was successfully challenged in the courts by her Conservative Party opponents on the grounds of her sex, and her subsequent appeal was dismissed. Cobden was not immediately challenged, but in April 1891, after a series of legal actions, she was effectively neutered as a councillor by being prevented from voting on pain of severe financial penalties.Hollis, pp. 310‚Äì16 Lansbury urged her, during the hearings, to \\"go to prison and let the Council back you up by refusing to declare your seat vacant\\".Schneer (\\"Politics and Feminism\\"), p. 75 Cobden did not follow this path. A Bill introduced in the House of Commons in May 1891 permitting women to serve as county councillors found little support among MPs of any party; women were not granted this right until 1907.Schneer (\\"Politics and Feminism\\"), p. 77 Lansbury was offended by his party's lukewarm support for women's rights. In a letter published in the Pall Mall Gazette he made an open call to Bow and Bromley's Liberals to \\"shake themselves free of party feeling and throw the energy and ability they are now wasting on minor questions into ... securing the full rights of citizenship to every woman in the land\\".Schneer (\\"Politics and Feminism\\"), pp. 79‚Äì80 He was further disillusioned by his party's failure to endorse the eight-hour maximum working day. Lansbury had formed the view, expressed some years later, that \\"Liberalism would progress just as far as the great money bags of capitalism would allow it to progress\\".Lansbury article in Labour Leader, 17 May 1912, quoted in Shepherd 2002, p. 26 By 1892 the Liberals no longer felt like Lansbury's political home; most of his current associates were avowed socialists: William Morris, Eleanor Marx, John Burns and Henry Mayers Hyndman, founder of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF).Shepherd 2002, p. 26 Nevertheless, Lansbury did not resign from the Liberals until he had fulfilled a commitment to act as election agent for John Murray MacDonald, the prospective Liberal candidate for Bow and Bromley. He saw his candidate victorious in the July 1892 General Election; as soon as the result was declared, Lansbury resigned from the Liberal Party and joined the SDF.Shepherd 2002, pp. 32‚Äì33 Socialist reformer=Social Democratic Federation= Henry Hyndman, founder of the SDF, was a key influence in Lansbury's early career. Lansbury's choice of the SDF, from several socialist organisations, reflected his admiration for Hyndman, whom he considered \\"one of the truly great ones\\".Lansbury, p. 2 Lansbury quickly became the federation's most tireless propagandist, travelling throughout Britain to address meetings or to demonstrate solidarity with workers involved in industrial disputes. Around this time, Lansbury temporarily set aside his Christian beliefs and became a member of the East London Ethical Society. One factor in his disillusion with the Church was the local clergy's unsympathetic approach to poor relief, and their opposition to collective political action.Shepherd 2002, pp. 40‚Äì41 In 1895 Lansbury fought two parliamentary elections for the SDF in Walworth, first a by-election on 14 May, then the 1895 general election two months later. Despite his energetic campaigning he was heavily defeated on each occasion, with tiny proportions of the vote.Shepherd 2002, pp. 44‚Äì45 After these dismal results, Lansbury was persuaded by Hyndman to give up his job at the sawmill and become the SDF's full-time salaried national organiser. He preached a straightforward revolutionary doctrine: \\"The time has arrived\\", he informed an audience at Todmorden in Lancashire, \\"for the working classes to seize political power and use it to overthrow the competitive system and establish in its place state cooperation\\".Todmorden Advertiser and Hebden Bridge Newsletter report, 29 November 1895, quoted by Shepherd 2002, p. 47 Lansbury's time as SDF national organiser did not last long; in 1896, when Isaac Brine died suddenly, Lansbury thought that his family duty required him to take charge of the sawmill, and he returned home to Bow.Shepherd 2002, p. 48 In the general election of 1900 a pact with the Liberals in the Bow and Bromley constituency gave Lansbury, the SDF candidate, a straight fight against the Conservative incumbent, William Guthrie. Lansbury's cause was hindered by his public opposition to the Boer War at a time when war fever was strong, while Guthrie, a former soldier, stressed his military credentials. Lansbury lost the election, though his total of 2,258 votes against Guthrie's 4,403 was considered creditable by the press.Shepherd 2002, pp. 78‚Äì81 This campaign was Lansbury's last major effort on behalf of the SDF. He became disenchanted by Hyndman's inability to work with other socialist groups, and in about 1903 resigned from the SDF to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP).Shepherd 2002, p. 77 At around this time, Lansbury rediscovered his Christian faith and rejoined the Anglican Church.Postgate, p. 55 =Poor Law guardian= In April 1893 Lansbury achieved his first elective office when he became a Poor Law guardian for the district of Poplar. In place of the traditionally harsh workhouse regime that was the norm, Lansbury proposed a programme of reform, whereby the workhouse became \\"an agency of help instead of a place of despair\\", and the stigma of poverty was removed.Shepherd 2002, pp. 54‚Äì56 Lansbury was one of a minority socialist bloc which was often able, through its energy and commitment, to win support for its plans.Postgate, p. 62 Education for the poor was one of Lansbury's major concerns. He helped to transform the Forest Gate District School, previously a punitive establishment run on quasi-military lines, into a proper place of education that became the Poplar Training School, and was still in existence more than half a century later.Postgate, pp. 67‚Äì68 At the 1897 annual Poor Law Conference Lansbury summarised his views on poor relief in his first published paper: \\"The Principles of the English Poor Law\\". His analysis offered a Marxist critique of capitalism: only the reorganisation of industry on collectivist lines would solve contemporary problems.Shepherd 2002, pp. 58‚Äì59 Lansbury added to his public duties when, in 1903, he was elected to Poplar Borough Council.Shepherd 2002, p. 57 In the summer of that year he met Joseph Fels, a rich American soap manufacturer with a penchant for social projects.Shepherd 2002, pp. 60‚Äì61 Lansbury persuaded Fels, in 1904, to purchase a 100-acre farm at Laindon, in Essex, which was converted into a labour colony that provided regular work for Poplar's unemployed and destitute. Fels also agreed to finance a much larger colony at Hollesley Bay in Suffolk, to be operated as a government scheme under the Local Government Board.Schneer 1990, pp. 42‚Äì43 Both projects were initially successful, but were undermined after the election of a Liberal government in 1906. The new Local Government minister was John Burns, a former SDF stalwart now ensconced in the Liberal Party who had become a firm opponent of socialism.Shepherd 2002, p. 63Postgate, p. 77 Burns encouraged a campaign of propaganda to discredit the principle of labour colonies, which were presented as money-wasting ventures that pampered idlers and scroungers. A formal enquiry revealed irregularities in the operation of the scheme, though it exonerated Lansbury. He retained the confidence of his electorate and was easily re-elected to the Board of Guardians in 1907.Schneer 1990, pp. 45‚Äì46Postgate, pp. 79‚Äì87 In 1905 Lansbury was appointed to a Royal Commission on the Poor Laws, which deliberated for four years. Lansbury, together with Beatrice Webb of the Fabian Society, argued for the complete abolition of the Poor Laws and their replacement by a system that incorporated old age pensions, a minimum wage, and national and local public works projects. These proposals were embodied at the Commission's conclusion in a minority report signed by Lansbury and Webb; the majority report was, according to Postgate, \\"an ill-considered jumble of suggestions ... so preposterously inadequate that no attempts were ever made to implement it.\\" Most of the minority's recommendations in time became national policy;Postgate, pp. 87‚Äì92 the Poor Laws were finally abolished by the Local Government Act 1929. National prominence=Campaigner for women's suffrage= WSPU poster from 1914, denouncing the Liberal government's controversial \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\" In the general election of January 1906 Lansbury stood as an independent socialist candidate in Middlesbrough, on a strong \\"votes for women\\" platform. This was his first campaign based on women's rights since the LCC election of 1889. He had been recommended to the constituency by Joseph Fels, who agreed to meet his expenses. The local ILP leadership was committed by an electoral pact to support the Liberal candidate, and could not endorse Lansbury, who secured less than 9 per cent of the vote.Shepherd 2002, pp. 83‚Äì88 The campaign had been managed by Marion Coates Hansen, a prominent local suffragist. Under Hansen's influence Lansbury took up the cause of \\"votes for women\\";Shepherd 2002, p. 89 he allied himself with the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU), the more militant of the main suffragist organisations, and became a close associate of Emmeline Pankhurst and her family.Schneer 1990, p. 95 The Liberal government elected in 1906 with a large majority showed little interest in the issue of women's suffrage;Schneer 1990, p. 93 when they lost their parliamentary majority in the general election of January 1910 they were dependent on the votes of the 40-odd Labour members. To Lansbury's dismay, Labour did not use this leverage to promote votes for women, instead giving the government virtually unqualified support to keep the Conservatives out of power.Shepherd 2002, p. 94Schneer 1990, p. 96 Lansbury had failed to win election as Labour's candidate at Bow and Bromley in January 1910; however, the continuing political crisis which developed from David Lloyd George's controversial 1909 \\"People's Budget\\" led to another general election in December 1910. Lansbury again fought Bow and Bromley, and this time was successful.Postgate, p. 103 Lansbury found little support in his fight for women's suffrage from his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as \\"a weak, flabby lot\\". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: \\"You are beneath contempt ... you ought to be driven from public life\\". He was temporarily suspended from the House for \\"disorderly conduct\\".Shepherd 2002, pp. 112‚Äì13 In October 1912, aware of the unbridgeable gap between his own position and that of his Labour colleagues, Lansbury resigned his seat to fight a by-election in Bow and Bromley on the specific issue of women's suffrage.Schneer 1990, p. 104 The suffragettes sent Grace Roe to help with campaign. He lost to his Conservative opponent, who campaigned on the slogan \\"No Petticoat Government\\".Schneer 1990, p. 107 and 112‚Äì17 Commenting on the result, the Labour MP Will Thorne opined that no constituency could ever be won on the single question of votes for women.Shepherd 2002, p. 128 Out of parliament, on 26 April 1913 Lansbury addressed a WSPU rally at the Albert Hall, and openly defended violent methods: \\"Let them burn and destroy property and do anything they will, and for every leader that is taken away, let a dozen step forward in their place\\". For this, Lansbury was charged with incitement, convicted and, after the dismissal of an appeal, sentenced to three months' imprisonment.Shepherd 2002, pp. 131‚Äì32 He immediately went on hunger strike, and was released after four days; although liable to rearrest under the so-called \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\", he was thereafter left at liberty.Postgate, p. 131 In the autumn of 1913, at the invitation of Fels, Lansbury and his wife travelled to America and Canada for an extended holiday. On his return, he devoted his main efforts to the recently founded newspaper, the Daily Herald.Shepherd 2002, pp. 135‚Äì37 =War, Daily Herald and Bolshevism= Lansbury in 1920 The Daily Herald began as a temporary bulletin during the London printers' strike of 1910‚Äì11. After the strike ended, Lansbury and others raised sufficient funds for the Herald to be relaunched in April 1912 as a socialist daily newspaper.Postgate, pp. 134‚Äì38 The paper attracted contributions from distinguished writers such as H. G. Wells, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and George Bernard Shaw, some of whom, Blythe notes, \\"weren't socialists at all but simply used [the paper] as a platform for their personal literary anarchy.\\"Blythe, pp. 276‚Äì77 Lansbury contributed regularly in support of his various causes, in particular the militant suffrage campaign,Shepherd 2002, p. 104 and early in 1914 assumed the paper's editorship.Shepherd 2002, p. 148 Punch cartoon of 22 September 1920, mocking Lansbury's denials of Bolshevist funding for the Daily Herald Before the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the Herald took a strong anti- war line.Shepherd 2002, p. 158 Addressing a large demonstration in Trafalgar Square on 2 August 1914, Lansbury blamed the coming conflict on capitalism: \\"The workers of all countries have no quarrel. They are ... exploited in times of peace and sent out to be massacred in times of war\\".Schneer 1990, p. 136 Lansbury's position was at odds with that of most of the Labour movement, which allied itself with the wartime coalition governments of Asquith and, from 1916, Lloyd George. In the prevailing jingoistic mood, numerous readers looked to the Herald‚Äîreduced by wartime economies to a weekly format‚Äîto present a balanced news perspective, untainted by war fever and chauvinism. During the winter of 1914‚Äì15, Lansbury visited the Western Front trenches. He sent eye-witness accounts to the paper, which supported calls for a negotiated peace with Germany in line with President Woodrow Wilson's later \\"peace note\\" of January 1917. The paper also gave sympathetic coverage to conscientious objectors, and to Irish and Indian nationalists.Holman. p. 81 Lansbury used the pages of the Daily Herald to welcome the February 1917 revolution in Russia as \\"a new star of hope ... arisen over Europe\\".Boulton, p. 235 At an Albert Hall rally on 18 March 1918 he hailed the spirit and enthusiasm of \\"this Russian movement\\", and urged his audience to \\"be ready to die, if necessary, for our faith\\".Schneer 1990, p. 168 When the war ended in November 1918, Lloyd George called an immediate general election, correctly calculating that victory euphoria would keep his coalition in power. In this triumphalist climate, candidates such as Lansbury who had opposed the war found themselves unpopular, and he failed to retake his Bow and Bromley seat.Postgate, p. 183 The Herald re-emerged as a daily paper in March 1919.Postgate, pp. 184‚Äì85 Under Lansbury's direction it maintained a strong and ultimately successful campaign against British intervention in the Russian Civil War. In February 1920 Lansbury travelled to Russia where he met Lenin and other Bolshevik leaders.Shepherd 2002, pp. 183‚Äì84 He published an account: What I Saw in Russia, but the impact of the visit was overshadowed by accusations that the Herald was being financed from Bolshevist sources, a charge vehemently denied by Lansbury: \\"We have received no Bolshevist money, no Bolshevist paper, no Bolshevist bonds\\". Unknown to Lansbury, the allegations had some truth which, when exposed, caused him and the paper considerable embarrassment.Shepherd 2002, pp. 187‚Äì88 By 1922 the Heralds financial problems had become such that it could no longer continue as a private venture financed by donations. Lansbury resigned the editorship and made the paper over to the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress (TUC), although he continued to write for it and remained its titular general manager until 3 January 1925.Shepherd 2002, pp. 223‚Äì24Postgate, pp. 221‚Äì22 =\\"Poplarism\\": the 1921 rates revolt= The Poplar Rates Rebellion Mural in Poplar commemorates the 1921 rates revolt. Throughout his national campaigns, Lansbury remained a Poplar borough councillor and Poor Law guardian, and between 1910 and 1913 served a three-year term as a London County Councillor.Postgate, p. 102 In 1919 he became the first Labour mayor of Poplar.Shepherd 2002, p. 191 Under the then-existing financial system for local government, boroughs were individually responsible for poor relief within their boundaries. This discriminated heavily against poorer councils such as Poplar, where rates revenues were low and poverty and unemployment, always severe, were exacerbated in times of economic recession. Under this system, Postgate argues, \\"The wealthy West End boroughs were evading responsibility, as though the desolate and silent docks were the results of a failure by the Poplar Borough Council\\".Postgate, pp. 216‚Äì220 In addition to meeting the costs of its own obligations, the council was required to levy precepts to pay for services provided by bodies such as the London County Council and the Metropolitan Police.Shepherd 2002, p. 194 Lansbury had long argued that a degree of rates equalisation across London was necessary, to share costs more fairly. At its meeting on 22 March 1921 the Poplar Council resolved not to make its precepts and to apply these revenues to the costs of local poor relief. This illegal action created a sensation, and led to legal proceedings against the council. On 29 July the thirty councillors involved marched in procession from Bow to the High Court, headed by a brass band. Informed by the judge that they must apply the precepts, the councillors would not budge; early in September, Lansbury and 29 fellow-councillors were imprisoned for contempt of court. Among those sentenced were his son Edgar and Edgar's wife, Minnie. The defiance of the Poplar councillors generated widespread interest and sympathy, and the publicity embarrassed the government. Several other Labour-controlled councils (including Stepney whose mayor was the future Labour leader Clement Attlee) threatened similar policies.Shepherd 2002, pp. 200‚Äì01 After six weeks' incarceration the councillors were released, and a government conference was convened to resolve the matter. This conference brought a significant personal victory for Lansbury: the passage of the Local Authorities (Financial Provisions) Act, which equalised the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. As a result, the rates in Poplar fell by a third, and additional revenues of ¬£400,000 was gained by the borough. Lansbury was hailed as a hero; in the 1922 general election he won the parliamentary seat of Bow and Bromley with a majority of nearly 7,000, and would hold it for the rest of his life. The term \\"Poplarism\\", always identified closely with Lansbury, became part of the political lexicon, applied generally to campaigns where local government stood against central government on behalf of the poor and least privileged of society. Parliament and national office=Labour backbencher= In May 1923 the Conservative prime minister, Bonar Law, resigned for health reasons. In December his successor, Stanley Baldwin, called another election in which the Conservatives lost their majority, with Labour in a strong second place. King George V advised Baldwin, as leader of the largest party, not to resign his office until defeated by a vote in the House of Commons. Defeat duly occurred on 21 January 1924, when the Liberals decided to throw in their lot with Labour. The king then asked Labour's leader, Ramsay MacDonald, to form a government.Nicolson, pp. 494‚Äì98Blythe, pp. 278‚Äì79 Lansbury caused royal offence by publicly implying that the king had colluded with other parties to keep Labour out, and by his references to the fate of Charles I.Nicolson, p. 497 Despite his seniority, Lansbury was offered only a junior non-cabinet post in the new government, which he declined.Postgate, pp. 224‚Äì25 He believed that his exclusion from the cabinet followed pressure from the king. At the 1923 Labour Party conference, while declaring himself a republican, Lansbury opposed two motions calling for the abolition of the monarchy, deeming the issue a \\"distraction\\". Social revolution, he said, would one day remove the monarchy. Inspecting the Neolithic village of Skara Brae, Orkneys, when First Commissioner at the Office of Works in 1929 MacDonald's administration lasted less than a year before, in November 1924, the Liberals withdrew their support; Blythe comments that the first Labour government had been \\"neither exhilarating nor competent\\". According to Shepherd, MacDonald's chief priority was to show that Labour was \\"fit to govern\\", and he had thus acted with conservative caution.Shepherd, p. 214 The December general election returned the Conservatives to power; Lansbury maintained that Labour's cause \\"marches forward irrespective of electoral results\\".Shepherd 2002, p. 221 After the defeat Lansbury was briefly touted as an alternative party leader to MacDonald, a proposition he rejected.Shepherd 2002, p. 222 In 1925, free from the Daily Herald, he founded and edited Lansbury's Labour Weekly, which became a mouthpiece for his personal creed of socialism, democracy and pacifism until it merged with the New Leader in 1927.Shepherd 2002, pp. 227 and p. 243 Before the General Strike of May 1926, Lansbury used the Weekly to instruct the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on preparations for the coming struggle. However, when the strike came the TUC did not want his assistance;Postgate, pp. 236 and 239 among the reasons for their distrust was Lansbury's continuing advocacy for the right of communist organisations to affiliate to the Labour Party‚Äîhe privately opined that British communists on their own \\"couldn't run a whelk- stall\\".Postgate, pp. 237‚Äì38 Lansbury continued his private campaigns in parliament, saying \\"I intend on every occasion to ... hinder the progress of business\\".Postgate, p. 236 In April 1926 he and 12 other opposition MPs prevented a vote in the House of Commons by obstructing the voting lobbies; they were temporarily suspended by the Speaker.Shepherd, p. 240Dilks, p. 456 During frequent clashes in the House with Neville Chamberlain, the Minister of Health responsible for Poor Law administration and reform, Lansbury referred to the \\"Ministry of Death\\",Shepherd, p. 238 and called the minister a \\"pinchbeck Napoleon\\".Dilks, p. 576 However, within the Labour Party itself, Lansbury's status and popularity led to his election as the party's chairman (a largely titular office) in 1927‚Äì28.Shepherd 2002, p. 246 Lansbury also became president of the International League Against Imperialism, where among his fellow executive members were Jawaharlal Nehru, Mme. Sun Yat-sen and Albert Einstein.Shepherd 2002, p. 247 In 1928, short of money following the failure of the family business, Lansbury published his autobiography, My Life, for which he received what he termed \\"a fairly generous cheque\\" from the publishers, Constable & Co.Shepherd 2002, p. 250 =Cabinet minister, 1929‚Äì31= The Hyde Park Lido, one lasting result of Lansbury's brief term of national office In the 1929 general election Labour emerged as the largest party, with 287 seats‚Äîbut without an overall majority.Shepherd 2002, p. 255 Once again, MacDonald formed a government dependent on Liberal support. Lansbury joined the new cabinet as First Commissioner of Works, with responsibilities for historic buildings and monuments and for the royal parks. This position was widely regarded as a sinecure;Shepherd, pp. 256‚Äì57 nevertheless, Lansbury proved an active minister who did much to improve public recreation facilities. His most notable achievement was the Lido on the Serpentine in Hyde Park; according to the historian A. J. P. Taylor \\"the only thing which keeps the memory of the second Labour government alive\\".Taylor, p. 343 A circular memorial plaque to Lansbury can be seen on the exterior wall of the Lido Bar and Cafe. Lansbury's duties brought him into frequent contact with the King, who as Ranger of the royal parks insisted on regular consultation. Contrary to the expectations of some the two formed a cordial relationship.Blythe, pp. 281‚Äì82Postgate, pp. 251‚Äì52 The years of MacDonald's second government were dominated by the economic depression that followed the Wall Street Crash of October 1929.Shepherd 2002, p. 253 Lansbury was appointed to a committee, chaired by J.H. Thomas and including Sir Oswald Mosley, charged with finding a solution to unemployment. Mosley produced a memorandum which called for a large-scale programme of public works; this was rejected by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, on grounds of cost.Nicolson, pp. 571‚Äì72Taylor, pp. 404‚Äì406 At the end of July 1931 the May Committee, appointed in February to investigate government spending,Taylor, p. 361 prescribed heavy cuts, including a massive reduction in unemployment benefit.Taylor, pp. 362‚Äì63 Making a speech, c. 1935 During August, in an atmosphere of financial panic and a run on the pound, the government debated the report. MacDonald and Snowden were prepared to implement it, but Lansbury and nine other cabinet ministers rejected the cut in unemployment benefit. Thus divided, the government could not continue; MacDonald, however, did not resign as prime minister. After discussions with the opposition leaders and the king he formed a national all-party coalition, with a \\"doctor's mandate\\" to tackle the economic crisis. The great majority of Labour MPs, including Lansbury, were opposed to this action; MacDonald and the few who followed him were expelled from the party, and Arthur Henderson became leader.Taylor, pp. 366‚Äì67 MacDonald's move was broadly welcomed in the country, however, and in the general election held in October 1931 the national government was returned with an enormous majority. Labour was reduced to 46 members; Lansbury was the only senior member of the Labour leadership to retain his seat. Party leader Although defeated in the election, Henderson remained the party leader while Lansbury headed the Labour group in parliament‚Äîthe Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). In October 1932 Henderson resigned and Lansbury succeeded him.Shepherd 2002, p. 282 In most historians' reckonings, Lansbury led his small parliamentary force with skill and flair. He was also, says Shepherd, an inspiration to the dispirited Labour rank and file.Shepherd 2002, p. 286 As leader he began the process of reforming the party's organisation and machinery, efforts which resulted in considerable by-election and municipal election successes‚Äîincluding control of the LCC under Herbert Morrison in 1934.Shepherd 2002, pp. 295‚Äì96 According to Blythe, Lansbury \\"represented political hope and decency to the three million unemployed.\\"Blythe, p. 283 During this period Lansbury published his political credo, My England (1934), which envisioned a future socialist state achieved by a mixture of revolutionary and evolutionary methods.Postgate, pp. 294‚Äì95 The small Labour group in parliament had little influence over economic policy; Lansbury's term as leader was dominated by foreign affairs and disarmament, and by policy disagreements within the Labour movement. The official party position was based on collective security through the League of Nations and on multilateral disarmament. Lansbury, supported by many in the PLP, adopted a position of Christian pacifism, unilateral disarmament and the dismantling of the British Empire.Vickers, pp. 107‚Äì08 Under his influence the party's 1933 conference passed resolutions calling for the \\"total disarmament of all nations\\", and pledged to take no part in war.Vickers, pp. 109‚Äì10 Pacifism became temporarily popular in the country; on 9 February 1933 the Oxford Union voted by 275 to 153 that it would \\"in no circumstances fight for its King and Country\\", and the Fulham East by-election in October 1933 was easily won by a Labour candidate committed to full disarmament. Lansbury sent a message to the constituency in his position as Labour Leader: \\"I would close every recruiting station, disband the Army and disarm the Air Force. I would abolish the whole dreadful equipment of war and say to the world: ‚ÄúDo your worst‚Äù.\\" October 1934 saw the emergence of the Peace Pledge Union. In response to the Peace Pledge Union, the League of Nations Union conducted the 1934‚Äì35 Peace Ballot, an unofficial public referendum, which produced massive majorities in support of the League of Nations, multilateral disarmament, and conflict resolution through non-military means - though crucially, a three-fold majority supported military measures as a last resort. Meanwhile, Adolf Hitler had come to power in Germany, and had withdrawn from the international Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. Blythe observes that Britain's noisy flirtations with pacifism \\"drowned out the sounds from German dockyards\\", as German rearmament began.Blythe, pp. 285‚Äì86 As fascism and militarism advanced in Europe, Lansbury's pacifist stance drew criticism from the trades union elements of his party‚Äîwho controlled the majority of party conference votes. Walter Citrine, the TUC general secretary, commented that Lansbury \\"thinks the country should be without defence of any kind ... it certainly isn't our policy.\\"Vickers, p. 112 The party's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October, under the shadow of Italy's impending invasion of Abyssinia. The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy, which Lansbury opposed as a form of economic warfare. His speech‚Äîa passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism‚Äîwas well received by the delegates, but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin, the Transport and General Workers' Union leader. Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a policy, agreed by all the party's main institutions, to oppose fascist aggression,Schneer 1990, p. 172 and accused him of \\"hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it\\".Shepherd 2002, pp. 323‚Äì28 Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority; Lansbury, realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party, resigned a few days later. Final years Lansbury was 76 years old when he resigned the Labour leadership; he did not, however, retire from public life. In the general election of November 1935 he kept his seat at Bow and Bromley; Labour, now led by Attlee, improved its parliamentary representation to 154. Lansbury devoted himself entirely to the cause of world peace, a quest that took him, in 1936, to the United States. He addressed large crowds in 27 cities before meeting President Roosevelt in Washington to present his proposals for a world peace conference.Schneer 1990, pp. 180‚Äì82 In 1937 he toured Europe, visiting leaders in Belgium, France and Scandinavia, and in April secured a private meeting with Hitler. No official report of the discussion was issued, but Lansbury's personal memorandum indicates that Hitler expressed willingness to join in a world conference if Roosevelt would convene it.Shepherd 2002, pp. 338‚Äì39 Later that year Lansbury met Mussolini in Rome; he described the Italian leader as \\"a mixture of Lloyd George, Stanley Baldwin and Winston Churchill\\". Lansbury wrote several accounts of his peace journeys, notably My Quest for Peace (1938).Shepherd, p. 332 His mild and optimistic impressions of the European dictators were widely criticised as na√Øve and out of touch; some British pacifists were dismayed at Lansbury's meeting with Hitler,Prasad, 2005 pp. 177-8 while the Daily Worker accused him of diverting attention from the aggressive realities of fascist policies.Shepherd 2002, p. 341 Lansbury continued to meet European leaders through 1938 and 1939, and was nominated, unsuccessfully, for the 1940 Nobel Peace Prize. At the funeral of George V, 1936 At home, Lansbury served a second term as Mayor of Poplar, in 1936‚Äì37. He argued against direct confrontation with Mosley's Blackshirts during the October 1936 demonstrations known as the Battle of Cable Street.Shepherd 2002, p. 342 In October 1937 he became president of the Peace Pledge Union, and a year later he welcomed the Munich Agreement as a step towards peace. During this period he worked on behalf of refugees from Nazi Germany, and was chairman of the Polish Refugee Fund which provided relief to displaced Jewish children. On 3 September 1939, after Neville Chamberlain's announcement of war with Germany, Lansbury addressed the House of Commons. Observing that the cause to which he had dedicated his life was going down in ruins, he added: \\"I hope that out of this terrible calamity will arise a spirit that will compel people to give up the reliance on force.\\" Early in 1940 Lansbury's health began to fail; although unaware, he was suffering from stomach cancer.Shepherd 2002, pp. 343‚Äì45 In an article published in the socialist magazine Tribune, published on 25 April 1940, he made a final statement of his Christian pacifism: \\"I hold fast to the truth that this world is big enough for all, that we are all brethren, children of one Father\\".Article in Tribune, 25 April 1940, quoted in Postgate, p. 324 Lansbury died on 7 May 1940, at the Manor House Hospital in Golders Green. His funeral in St Mary's Church, Bow, was followed by cremation at Ilford Crematorium,Holman, p. 164 before a memorial service in Westminster Abbey. His ashes were scattered at sea, in accordance with the wish expressed in his will: \\"I desire this because although I love England very dearly ... I am a convinced internationalist\\". Tributes and legacy Most historical assessments of Lansbury have tended to stress his character and principles rather than his effectiveness as a party political leader. His biographer Jonathan Schneer writes: The Lansbury Estate, Poplar Historian A. J. P. Taylor labeled Lansbury as \\"the most lovable figure in modern politics\\" and the outstanding figure of the English revolutionary left in the 20th century,Taylor, p. 191 and p. 270 while Kenneth O. Morgan, in his biography of a later Labour leader, Michael Foot, regards Lansbury as \\"an agitator of protest, not a politician of power\\".Morgan, p.154 Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of sentimentality, and party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity.Shepherd 2002, pp. 360‚Äì63 Nevertheless, his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers to him as a \\"prophet\\".Morgan, p. 482 Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man's achievements in establishing the Daily Herald, given his complete lack of journalistic training.Morgan, p. 132 Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury's pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin's demolition at the 1935 conference was justified.Morgan, p. 77 There is much agreement among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his Christian socialist principles, was consistent in his efforts on behalf of the poorest in society. Shepherd believes that \\"there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks\\". In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: \\"There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism\\". Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: \\"He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered ... [H]e was ever the champion of the weak, and ... to the end of his life he strove for that in which he believed\\". After the Second World War, a stained glass window designed by the Belgian artist Eugeen Yoors was placed in the Kingsley Hall community centre in Bow, as a memorial to Lansbury. His memory is further sustained by streets and housing developments named after him, most notably the Lansbury Estate in Poplar, completed in 1951. A further enduring memorial, Attlee suggests, is the extent to which the then-revolutionary social policies that Lansbury began advocating before the turn of the 20th century had become accepted mainstream doctrine little more than a decade after his death.Attlee, p. 3 His name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018. Personal and family life George married Elizabeth Jane (Bessie) Brine on 22 May 1880 in Whitechapel, London. For most of their married life, George and Bessie Lansbury lived in Bow, originally in St Stephen's Road and, from 1916, at 39 Bow Road, a house which, Shepherd records, became \\"a political haven\\" for those requiring assistance of any kind.Shepherd 2002, p. 351 Bessie died in 1933, after 53 years of a marriage that had produced 12 children between 1881 and 1905.Shepherd 2002, pp. 347‚Äì49 Of the ten who survived to adulthood, Edgar followed his father into local political activism as a Poplar councillor in 1912, serving as the borough's mayor in 1924‚Äì25. He was for a time a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). After the death of his first wife Minnie in 1922, Edgar married Moyna Macgill, an actress from Belfast;Shepherd 2002, p. 307 their daughter Dame Angela Lansbury, born in 1925, became a stage and screen actress. George Lansbury's youngest daughter Violet (1900‚Äì71) was an active CPGB member in the 1920s, who lived and worked in Moscow for many years. She married Clemens Palme Dutt, the brother of the Marxist intellectual Rajani Palme Dutt.Shepherd 2002, p. 212 Another daughter, Dorothy (1890‚Äì1973), was a women's rights activist and later a campaigner for contraceptive and abortion rights. She married Ernest Thurtle, the Labour MP for Shoreditch, and was herself a member of Shoreditch council, serving as mayor in 1936. She and her husband founded the Workers' Birth Control Group in 1924. Her younger sister Daisy (1892‚Äì1971) served as George Lansbury's secretary for 20 years. In 1913 she helped Sylvia Pankhurst to evade police capture by disguising herself as Pankhurst.Shepherd 2002, p. 121 and p. 354 She was married to Raymond Postgate, the left-wing writer and historian, who was Lansbury's first biographer and founder of The Good Food Guide. Their son, Oliver Postgate, was a successful writer, animator and producer for children's television. The Lansbury home at 39 Bow Road was destroyed by bombing during the London Blitz of 1940‚Äì41.Blythe, p. 293 There is a small memorial stone dedicated to Lansbury in front of the current building, appropriately named George Lansbury House, which itself carries a memorial plaque. There is also a memorial to Lansbury in the nearby Bow Church, where Lansbury was a long-term member of the congregation and churchwarden.

He wrote extensively on statistical mechanics and on foundations of probability and statistical inference, initiating in 1957 the maximum entropy interpretation of thermodynamics as being a particular application of more general Bayesian/information theory techniques (although he argued this was already implicit in the works of Josiah Willard Gibbs). Jaynes strongly promoted the interpretation of probability theory as an extension of logic. In 1963, together with Fred Cummings, he modeled the evolution of a two-level atom in an electromagnetic field, in a fully quantized way. This model is known as the Jaynes‚ÄìCummings model. A particular focus of his work was the construction of logical principles for assigning prior probability distributions; see the principle of maximum entropy, the principle of transformation groups and Laplace's principle of indifference. Other contributions include the mind projection fallacy. Jaynes' book, Probability Theory: The Logic of Science (2003) gathers various threads of modern thinking about Bayesian probability and statistical inference, develops the notion of probability theory as extended logic, and contrasts the advantages of Bayesian techniques with the results of other approaches. This book was published posthumously in 2003 (from an incomplete manuscript that was edited by Larry Bretthorst).  References External links Edwin Thompson Jaynes.

Functions Agudah serves as a leadership and policy umbrella organization for Haredi Jews in the United States representing the vast majority of members of the yeshiva world, sometimes known by the old label of misnagdim, as well as a number of Hasidic groups. However, not all Hasidic groups are affiliated with Agudath Israel. For example, the Hasidic group Satmar, which is vehemently anti-Zionist, dislikes Agudah's relatively moderate stance towards the State of Israel.Jonathan Rosenblum, \\"Reb Elimelech Gavriel (Mike) Tress\\", in Nora Roberts, Daring to Dream, Feldheim Publishers, 2006. \\"Even the Satmar Rebbe, a fierce ideological opponent of Agudath Israel, once told Mike's son Mendel 'If there were nine more people in the world like your father, Moshiach would come.'\\" Agudah has ideological connections with both the Agudat Israel party and with Degel HaTorah (), two Israeli Haredi political parties that have representation in the Knesset (Israel's parliament). In Israel, Degel and Agudah are in a political coalition called United Torah Judaism (UTJ).\\"list made up of the ultra-Orthodox parties Agudat Israel and Degel HaTorah ...

After the Holocaust, some prominent rabbis who made their home in America established a moetzes (\\"supreme council\\"), and the movement began to grow rapidly with the rise of the yeshiva-based and Hasidic Orthodox communities. Mike Tress led the expansion of the movement during the early 1940s as its chief lay leader until his death in 1967. His cousin Rabbi Moshe Sherer then took the reins as president\\"aided the right wing of Orthodox Judaism by helping build the Agudath Israel of America organization from a small group into an influential force.\\" and the organization flourished further in size and accomplishments. After his passing in May 1998, he was succeeded by Rabbi Shmuel Bloom, as Executive Vice President. In 2008 Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel, having served Agudah as general counsel and director of government affairs, took over as Executive Vice-President.\\"Rabbi Chaim David Zwiebel has been the executive vice president of Agudath Israel since 2008. Prior to that, he worked for 30 years at a law firm.\\" In 2016, his salary was $220,000. In April 2020 Agudath Israel of America head Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the Novominsker Rebbe, 89 years old, died after contracting Covid-19, one month after he urged American Orthodox Jews to follow social distancing and other precautionary guidelines in response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying: \\"We cannot behave the way we did last week or two weeks ago. We're told that the halakha (Jewish law) is that we must listen to doctors, whether it's about a sick person or Yom Kippur\\". Structure Agudah's policies and leadership are directed by its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah: Council of Torah Sages, composed primarily of rosh yeshivas (the chief spiritual and scholarly authority in a yeshiva) and Hasidic rebbes (who head Hasidic dynasties and organizations). The Moetzes sets all major policies and guides the organization according to its precepts of daas torah (), generally translated as Torah knowledge/direction.Avi Shafran, \\"What Da'at Torah really means\\", New York Jewish Week. Reprinted at Rabbi Yaakov Perlow (recently deceased), who was the Novominsker rebbe and a member of the Moetzes, was appointed as the Rosh Agudat Yisrael (\\"Head of Agudath Israel\\"). The executive staff includes Reb Shia Markowitz as CEO, Rabbi Chaim Dovid Zwiebel as the Executive Vice President, and Rabbi Labish Becker as the Executive Director. There are several Agudah-affiliated synagogues across the United States and Canada. Positions The Agudah takes positions on many political, religious, and social issues, primarily guided by its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. It uses these stances to advise its members, advocate for its constituency in the halls of government, and to file amicus briefs on behalf of the Haredi Orthodox Jewish community in the United States. =Conservative, Reform, and Modern Orthodox Judaism= In 1956, for example, the moetzes issued a written ruling forbidding Orthodox rabbis to join with any Reform or Conservative rabbis in rabbinical communal professional organizations that then united the various branches of America's Jews, such as the Synagogue Council of America. This position was not endorsed by the Modern Orthodox. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University had initially aligned himself with Agudah, but later established his independent views on these matters and a host of other issues, such as attitudes towards college education and attitudes towards the secular- led Israeli governments. Rabbi Soloveitchik believed it important to nurture the more modern Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America (RCA). However, at times, some of the more traditionalist rabbis at Yeshiva University aligned themselves with Agudah's positions. =Women= In 2015 and 2017, Agudah denounced moves to ordain women. It went even further, declaring Yeshivat Maharat, Open Orthodoxy, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, and other affiliated entities to be similar to other dissident movements throughout Jewish history in having rejected basic tenets of Judaism. Avi Shafran, director of public affairs, wrote \\"... women ... assuming positions of public leadership is ... antithetical to the concept of tzniut (modesty). Agudah forbade ordained Orthodox female clergy from being hired to lead congregations. Dr. Noam Stadlan, a board member of the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance, wrote: \\"On this issue, the Agudah is irrelevant to Modern Orthodoxy in the same way Satmar or Neturei Karta views are irrelevant on issues of Zionism.\\" =Abortion= In 2019, commenting on abortion, Agudath said \\"Jewish tradition teaches that a human fetus has status and dignity, and that abortion is prohibited in the vast majority of pregnancies,\\" with certain exceptions in which it is permitted and in others where it is required. Other Orthodox New York rabbis offered opposing positions. =Vaccination= Also in 2019, Agudath lobbied against a New Jersey bill that would have ended a policy allowing New Jersey parents to not immunize their children--because of religious beliefs, but to still enroll them in school. The bill included an exemption for private schools. In the 2018-19 school year religious exemptions in New Jersey had grown to 2.6%. Doctors and public health experts had said the bill was urgently needed to prevent the level of measles outbreak that spread across the region in 2018 (the largest outbreak in three decades in the area), with most cases of measles being Orthodox Jews, and emphasized that there is overwhelming scientific consensus that vaccines are safe and effective. =Zionism= While Agudath does not consider itself Zionist, it is generally supportive of the State of Israel insofar as Agudath supports participation in its politics and the development of religious life, as well as the security of its population. It became more involved after the Israeli state was established in 1948. Agudah takes stances on issues affecting the Haredi sector in Israel; in contradistinction to the more stridently anti- Zionist Haredi communal organizations. Activities=Political activity= Agudah also has active branches in 27 states, including Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, Minnesota, Texas, Florida, California, and New Jersey, where they lobby the judicial and legislative branches of these state and local governments on any issue it deems important morally or religiously or important to its constituency (for example, abortion, physician-assisted suicide, same-sex marriage, school vouchers/school choice). Agudath Israel's federal activities are coordinated by Rabbi Abba Cohen, the Director and Counsel of the organization's Washington office. Agudah was the first Orthodox Jewish group to open a Washington Office, in 1988, and maintains ongoing relations with the White House and executive agencies, as well as with the U.S. Congress, on various domestic and foreign issues.\\"Rabbi Abba Cohen, Agudath Israel's Washington Director\\" -\\"After 28 years in Washington, Abba Cohen of Agudath Israel of America ...\\" Agudath Israel World Organization also has a representative at the United Nations. Agudah files amicus briefs in cases at all levels of the judiciary, often signing on as one of the organization signatories to a brief authored by Nat Lewin or the National Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs. With its head office in Manhattan, and the bulk of its members living in the New York-New Jersey area, the Agudah monitors and intercedes on behalf of causes important to it in the politics of New York City, its five boroughs, and in the state government of New York State. Fingerprinting controversy Official spokesman\\"Rabbi Avi Shafran ... currently serves as the organization's spokesperson and media liaison.\\"\\"comments by Avi Shafran, a spokesman for the Orthodox group Agudath Israel of America.\\" Rabbi Avi Shafran denied claims by The Jewish Week that Aguda \\"is opposed to both the mandated reporting and finger printing, and background check legislation\\" then under consideration, and cited a memorandum from 2 years priordated June 20, 2006 expressing strong support for the legislation. The difference is Aguda's 2006 support was for legislation that passed in 2007 _permitting_ but not mandating fingerprinting/background checking., =Youth services= Agudah maintains a network of summer youth camps (including Camp Agudah, Camp Bnos, Camp Chayl Miriam, and Camp Bnoseinu in the Catskills in New York, as well as camps in the Midwest and Toronto, Canada). Sometimes referred to as \\"Pirchei / Zeirei\\", this was part of the work by Mike Tress. \\"JEP\\" (Jewish Education Program) is known for its release hour work, and was identified by Harav Yaakov Perlow as \\"the JEP operation of Zeirei Agudath Israel\\" in a 1977 interview, in which he spoke about \\"to take off a seder from yeshiva and go out and speak at a release hour at a public school.\\" =Social services= Agudah has a number of social service branches that cater to the elderly, poor, or disabled. It has a job training program called COPE, a job placement division, and a housing program. The Agudah is responsible for the founding of other national institutions and projects, including the Beis Yaakov girls' school system, and the national Daf Yomi Commission. Communications Agudah advocates its positions in several ways: * Publication of an e-newsletter, Weekly Window * Publication of a general- interest monthly magazine, The Jewish Observer, since 1963 * Maintains full- time offices in Washington, DC, and the US west coast, Midwest, and South * Activism by lobbying and submitting amicus briefs * Organizes prominent lay- person missions to government agencies * Rabbi Avi Shafran, the official spokesman of Agudah, responds to media articles and statements which concern the Haredi Orthodox community; Shafran also organizes members to do the same * Conveys its positions in the Jewish media, particularly through privately owned weekly Jewish newspapers in English called \\"HaModia\\" and \\"Yated Neeman\\" (distinct from the Israeli English-language newspaper carrying the same name), which convey news and views from the Haredi Orthodox point of view * Publication of articles and press releases on its website See also *Agudat Israel (of Israel) *Degel HaTorah *Orthodox Judaism *Haredi Judaism *Schisms among the Jews: Hasidim and Mitnagdim *World Agudath Israel ReferencesExternal links *Agudath Israel of America Official Website *National public policy of Agudah, 1999 *Professional survey of Agudah *Dei'ah Vedibur, weekly web edition of Yated Neeman newspaper *The Jewish Observer, Agudah's magazine, on the web *The Lefkowitz Leadership Initiative, Agudah's website for younger people * Category:Ashkenazi Jewish culture in the United States Category:Haredi Judaism in the United States Category:Jewish community organizations Category:Private and independent school organizations in the United States Category:Rabbinical organizations Category:Agudat Yisrael ","title":"Agudath Israel of America"},{"id":"166980","text":"In order theory, a field of mathematics, an incidence algebra is an associative algebra, defined for every locally finite partially ordered set and commutative ring with unity. Subalgebras called reduced incidence algebras give a natural construction of various types of generating functions used in combinatorics and number theory. Definition A locally finite poset is one in which every closed interval :[a, b] = {x : a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b} is finite. The members of the incidence algebra are the functions f assigning to each nonempty interval [a, b] a scalar f(a, b), which is taken from the ring of scalars, a commutative ring with unity. On this underlying set one defines addition and scalar multiplication pointwise, and \\"multiplication\\" in the incidence algebra is a convolution defined by :(f*g)(a, b)=\\\\sum_{a\\\\leq x\\\\leq b}f(a, x)g(x, b). An incidence algebra is finite-dimensional if and only if the underlying poset is finite. =Related concepts= An incidence algebra is analogous to a group algebra; indeed, both the group algebra and the incidence algebra are special cases of a category algebra, defined analogously; groups and posets being special kinds of categories. Special elements The multiplicative identity element of the incidence algebra is the delta function, defined by : \\\\delta(a, b) = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & \\\\text{if } a=b, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if } a e b. \\\\end{cases} The zeta function of an incidence algebra is the constant function Œ∂(a, b) = 1 for every nonempty interval [a, b]. Multiplying by Œ∂ is analogous to integration. One can show that Œ∂ is invertible in the incidence algebra (with respect to the convolution defined above). (Generally, a member h of the incidence algebra is invertible if and only if h(x, x) is invertible for every x.) The multiplicative inverse of the zeta function is the M√∂bius function Œº(a, b); every value of Œº(a, b) is an integral multiple of 1 in the base ring. The M√∂bius function can also be defined inductively by the following relation: : \\\\mu(x,y) = \\\\begin{cases} {}\\\\qquad 1 & \\\\text{if } x = y\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] \\\\displaystyle -\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\sum_{z\\\\, :\\\\, x\\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, z\\\\, <\\\\, y} \\\\mu(x,z) & \\\\text{for } x Multiplying by Œº is analogous to differentiation, and is called M√∂bius inversion. The square of the zeta function counts the number of elements in an interval: > \\\\textstyle \\\\zeta^2(x,y)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{z\\\\in [x,y]}\\\\zeta(x,z)\\\\,\\\\zeta(z,y) \\\\ =\\\\ > \\\\sum_{z\\\\in [x,y]} 1 \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\\\\\#[x,y]. Examples *Positive integers ordered by divisibility :The convolution associated to the incidence algebra for intervals [1, n] becomes the Dirichlet convolution, hence the M√∂bius function is Œº(a, b) = Œº(b/a), where the second \\"Œº\\" is the classical M√∂bius function introduced into number theory in the 19th century. *Finite subsets of some set E, ordered by inclusion :The M√∂bius function is ::\\\\mu(S,T)=(-1)^{\\\\leftT\\\\smallsetminus S\\\\right} :whenever S and T are finite subsets of E with S ‚äÜ T, and M√∂bius inversion is called the principle of inclusion-exclusion. :Geometrically, this is a hypercube: 2^E = \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^E. *Natural numbers with their usual order :The M√∂bius function is ::\\\\mu(x,y)=\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{rl} 1& \\\\text{if }y=x, \\\\\\\\\\\\ -1 & \\\\text{if }y = x+1, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{if }y>x+1, \\\\end{array}\\\\right. :and M√∂bius inversion is called the (backwards) difference operator. :Geometrically, this corresponds to the discrete number line. :The convolution of functions in the incidence algebra corresponds to multiplication of formal power series: see the discussion of reduced incidence algebras below. The M√∂bius function corresponds to the sequence (1, ‚àí1, 0, 0, 0, ... ) of coefficients of the formal power series 1 ‚àí t, and the zeta function corresponds to the sequence of coefficients (1, 1, 1, 1, ... ) of the formal power series (1 - t)^{-1} = 1 + t + t^2 + t^3 + \\\\cdots, which is inverse. The delta function in this incidence algebra similarly corresponds to the formal power series 1. *Finite sub-multisets of some multiset E, ordered by inclusion :The above three examples can be unified and generalized by considering a multiset E, and finite sub-multisets S and T of E. The M√∂bius function is ::\\\\mu(S,T)=\\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } T\\\\smallsetminus S \\\\text{ is a proper multiset (has repeated elements)}\\\\\\\\\\\\ (-1)^{\\\\leftT\\\\smallsetminus S\\\\right} & \\\\text{if } T\\\\smallsetminus S \\\\text{ is a set (has no repeated elements)}.\\\\end{cases} :This generalizes the positive integers ordered by divisibility by a positive integer corresponding to its multiset of prime divisors with multiplicity, e.g., 12 corresponds to the multiset \\\\\\\\{2,2,3\\\\\\\\}. :This generalizes the natural numbers with their usual order by a natural number corresponding to a multiset of one underlying element and cardinality equal to that number, e.g., 3 corresponds to the multiset \\\\\\\\{1,1,1\\\\\\\\}. *Subgroups of a finite p-group G, ordered by inclusion :The M√∂bius function is ::\\\\mu_G(H_1,H_2)=(-1)^{k}p^{\\\\binom{k}{2}} if H_1 is a normal subgroup of H_2 and H_2/H_1 \\\\cong ({\\\\mathbf Z}/p{\\\\mathbf Z})^k ::and it is 0 otherwise. This is a theorem of Weisner (1935). *Partitions of a set :Partially order the set of all partitions of a finite set by saying œÉ ‚â§ œÑ if œÉ is a finer partition than œÑ. In particular, let œÑ have _t_ blocks which respectively split into s1, . . . , st finer blocks of œÉ, which has a total of s = s1 \\\\+ *** \\\\+ st blocks. Then the M√∂bius function is: ::\\\\mu(\\\\sigma,\\\\tau)= (-1)^{s-t}(s_1{-}1)!\\\\cdots (s_t{-}1)! Euler characteristic A poset is bounded if it has smallest and largest elements, which we call 0 and 1 respectively (not to be confused with the 0 and 1 of the ring of scalars). The Euler characteristic of a bounded finite poset is Œº(0,1). The reason for this terminology is the following: If P has a 0 and 1, then Œº(0,1) is the reduced Euler characteristic of the simplicial complex whose faces are chains in P \\\\ {0, 1}. This can be shown using Philip Hall's theorem, relating the value of Œº(0,1) to the number of chains of length i. Reduced incidence algebras The reduced incidence algebra consists of functions which assign the same value to any two intervals which are equivalent in an appropriate sense, usually meaning isomorphic as posets. This is a subalgebra of the incidence algebra, and it clearly contains the incidence algebra's identity element and zeta function. Any element of the reduced incidence algebra that is invertible in the larger incidence algebra has its inverse in the reduced incidence algebra. Thus the M√∂bius function is also in the reduced incidence algebra. Reduced incidence algebras were introduced by Doubillet, Rota, and Stanley to give a natural construction of various rings of generating functions.Peter Doubilet, Gian-Carlo Rota and Richard Stanley: On the Foundations of Combinatorics (IV): The Idea of Generating Function, Berkeley Symp. on Math. Statist. and Prob. Proc. Sixth Berkeley Symp. on Math. Statist. and Prob., Vol. 2 (Univ. of Calif. Press, 1972), 267-318, available online in open access = Natural numbers and ordinary generating functions = For the poset (\\\\mathbb{N},\\\\leq), the reduced incidence algebra consists of functions f(a,b) invariant under translation, f(a+k,b+k) = f(a,b) for all k\\\\ge 0, so as to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [a+k, b+k] and [a,b]. Let t denote the function with t(a, a+1) = 1 and t(a,b) = 0 otherwise, a kind of invariant delta function on isomorphism classes of intervals. Its powers in the incidence algebra are the other invariant delta functions tn(a, a+n) = 1 and tn(x,y) = 0 otherwise. These form a basis for the reduced incidence algebra, and we may write any invariant function as \\\\textstyle f = \\\\sum_{n\\\\ge 0} f(0,n)t^n. This notation makes clear the isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of formal power series Rt over the scalars R, also known as the ring of ordinary generating functions. We may write the zeta function as \\\\zeta=1+t+t^2+\\\\cdots = \\\\tfrac1{1-t}, the reciprocal of the M√∂bius function \\\\mu=1-t. = Subset poset and exponential generating functions = For the Boolean poset of finite subsets S\\\\subset\\\\\\\\{1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} ordered by inclusion S\\\\subset T, the reduced incidence algebra consists of invariant functions f(S,T), defined to have the same value on isomorphic intervals [S,T] and [S',T'] with T\\\\S = T'\\\\S'. Again, let t denote the invariant delta function with t(S,T) = 1 for T\\\\S = 1 and t(S,T) = 0 otherwise. Its powers are: > t^n(S,T)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum t(T_0,T_1)\\\\,t(T_1,T_2)\\\\cdots t(T_{n-1},T_n) \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ > \\\\begin{array}{cl} n! & \\\\text{if }\\\\ T{\\\\setminus}S = n\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & > \\\\text{otherwise,}\\\\end{array}\\\\right. where the sum is over all chains S = T_0\\\\subset T_1\\\\subset\\\\cdots\\\\subset T_n=T, and the only non-zero terms occur for saturated chains with T_{i}{\\\\setminus}T_{i-1} = 1; since these correspond to permutations of n, we get the unique non-zero value n!. Thus, the invariant delta functions are the divided powers \\\\tfrac{t^n}{n!}, and we may write any invariant function as \\\\textstyle f = \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq0} f(\\\\emptyset,[n])\\\\frac{t^n}{n!}, where [n] = {1, . . . , n}. This gives a natural isomorphism between the reduced incidence algebra and the ring of exponential generating functions. The zeta function is \\\\textstyle \\\\zeta = \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 0}\\\\frac{t^n}{n!} = \\\\exp(t), with M√∂bius function: > \\\\textstyle \\\\mu \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\frac1{\\\\zeta} \\\\ =\\\\ \\\\exp(-t) \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 0} (-1)^n > \\\\frac{t^n}{n!}. Indeed, this computation with formal power series proves that \\\\mu(S,T)=(-1)^{T{\\\\setminus}S}. Many combinatorial counting sequences involving subsets or labeled objects can be interpreted in terms of the reduced incidence algebra, and computed using exponential generating functions. = Divisor poset and Dirichlet series = Consider the poset D of positive integers ordered by divisibility, denoted ab. The reduced incidence algebra consists of functions f(a,b) invariant under multiplication, f(ka,kb) = f(a,b) for all k\\\\ge 1. (This multiplication equivalence of intervals is a much stronger relation than poset isomorphism: for prime p, the two-element intervals [1,p] are all inequivalent.) For an invariant function, f(a,b) depends only on b/a, so a natural basis consists of invariant delta functions \\\\delta_n defined by \\\\delta_n(a,b) = 1 if b/a = n and 0 otherwise: any invariant function can be written \\\\textstyle f \\\\ = \\\\ \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 0} f(1,n)\\\\, \\\\delta_n. The product of two invariant delta functions is: > (\\\\delta_n \\\\delta_m)(a,b)\\\\ =\\\\ \\\\sum_{acb} \\\\delta_n(a,c)\\\\,\\\\delta_m(c,b)\\\\ = \\\\ > \\\\delta_{nm}(a,b), since the only non-zero term comes from c = na and b = mc = nma. Thus, we get an isomorphism from the reduced incidence algebra to the ring of formal Dirichlet series by sending \\\\delta_n to n^{-s}\\\\\\\\!, so that f corresponds to \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 1} \\\\frac{f(1,n)}{n^s}. The incidence algebra zeta function Œ∂D(a,b) = 1 corresponds to the classical Riemann zeta function \\\\zeta(s)=\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 1}\\\\frac{1}{n^s}, having reciprocal \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{1}{\\\\zeta(s)}=\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 1}\\\\frac{\\\\mu(n)}{n^s}, where \\\\mu(n)=\\\\mu_D(1,n) is the classical M√∂bius function of number theory. Many other arithmetic functions arise naturally within the reduced incidence algebra, and equivalently in terms of Dirichlet series. For example, the divisor function \\\\sigma_0(n) is the square of the zeta function, \\\\sigma_0(n) = \\\\zeta^2\\\\\\\\!(1,n), a special case of the above result that \\\\zeta^2\\\\\\\\!(x,y) counts the number of elements in the interval [x,y]; equivalenty, \\\\textstyle\\\\zeta(s)^2 = \\\\sum_{n\\\\geq 1}\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_0(n)}{n^s}. The product structure of the divisor poset facilitates the computation of its M√∂bius function. Unique factorization into primes implies D is isomorphic to an infinite Cartesian product \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\times \\\\mathbb{N}\\\\times \\\\cdots, with the order given by coordinatewise comparison: n=p_1^{e_1}p_2^{e_2}\\\\cdots, where p_k is the kth prime, corresponds to its sequence of exponents (e_1,e_2,\\\\ldots). Now the M√∂bius function of D is the product of the M√∂bius functions for the factor posets, computed above, giving the classical formula: > \\\\mu(n)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\mu_D(1,n)\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\prod_{k\\\\geq 1}\\\\mu_{\\\\mathbb{N}}(0,e_k) > \\\\,=\\\\,\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{cl}(-1)^d & \\\\text{ for } n \\\\text{ squarefree with > } d \\\\text{ prime factors}\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\text{otherwise.} \\\\end{array}\\\\right. The product structure also explains the classical Euler product for the zeta function. The zeta function of D corresponds to a Cartesian product of zeta functions of the factors, computed above as \\\\tfrac{1}{1-t}, so that \\\\textstyle \\\\zeta_D \\\\cong \\\\prod_{k\\\\geq 1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\frac{1}{1-t}, where the right side is a Cartesian product. Applying the isomorphism which sends t in the kth factor to p_k^{-s}, we obtain the usual Euler product.

The Suda says only that he lived in the times of Marcus Aurelius, but the contempt with which he speaks of Commodus, who died in 192, shows that he survived that emperor. He was a contemporary of Adrantus. Several of his publications are lost, but the fifteen-volume Deipnosophistae mostly survives. Publications Athenaeus himself states that he was the author of a treatise on the thratta, a kind of fish mentioned by Archippus and other comic poets, and of a history of the Syrian kings. Both works are lost. Greek banquet. Banqueters playing Kottabos while a musician plays the Aulos, decorated by the artist 'Nicias'/'Nikias' =The Deipnosophistae= Deipnosophistae, 1535 The Deipnosophistae, which means \\"dinner-table philosophers,\\" survives in fifteen books. The first two books, and parts of the third, eleventh and fifteenth, are extant only in epitome, but otherwise the work seems to be entire. It is an immense store-house of information, chiefly on matters connected with dining, but also containing remarks on music, songs, dances, games, courtesans, and luxury. Nearly 800 writers and 2500 separate works are referred to by Athenaeus; one of his characters (not necessarily to be identified with the historical author himself) boasts of having read 800 plays of Athenian Middle Comedy alone. Were it not for Athenaeus, much valuable information about the ancient world would be missing, and many ancient Greek authors such as Archestratus would be almost entirely unknown. Book XIII, for example, is an important source for the study of sexuality in classical and Hellenistic Greece, and a rare fragment of Theognetus' work survives in 3.63. The Deipnosophistae professes to be an account given by an individual named Athenaeus to his friend Timocrates of a banquet held at the house of Larensius (ŒõŒ±œÅŒÆŒΩœÉŒπŒøœÇ; in Latin: Larensis), a wealthy book-collector and patron of the arts. It is thus a dialogue within a dialogue, after the manner of Plato, but the conversation extends to enormous length. The topics for discussion generally arise from the course of the dinner itself, but extend to literary and historical matters of every description, including abstruse points of grammar. The guests supposedly quote from memory. The actual sources of the material preserved in the Deipnosophistae remain obscure, but much of it probably comes at second-hand from early scholars. The twenty-four named guests include individuals called Galen and Ulpian, but they are all probably fictitious personages, and the majority take no part in the conversation. If the character Ulpian is identical with the famous jurist, the Deipnosophistae may have been written after his death in 223; but the jurist was murdered by the Praetorian Guard, whereas Ulpian in Athenaeus dies a natural death. The complete version of the text, with the gaps noted above, is preserved in only one manuscript, conventionally referred to as A. The epitomized version of the text is preserved in two manuscripts, conventionally known as C and E. The standard edition of the text is Kaibel's Teubner. The standard numbering is drawn largely from Casaubon. The encyclopaedist and author Sir Thomas Browne wrote a short essay upon AthenaeusSir Thomas Browne, From a Reading of Athenaeus which reflects a revived interest in the Banquet of the Learned amongst scholars during the 17th century following its publication in 1612 by the Classical scholar Isaac Casaubon. Death One of Athenaeus' friends, Timocrates, wrote about the untimely death of Athenaeus in the Athenaeum. It describes the tale of angry peasants who believed that Athenaeus' writings directly contradicted their personal beliefs of the Mithras cult. One night in 191 A.D., they kidnapped him and threatened to kill him if he did not stop writing. When they discovered that he continued writing the Deipnosophistae, twenty-three men stormed into his home and strangled him to death. It is unclear whether Athenaeus finished his work on his own or Timocrates finished it for him, as most of the Athenaeum is lost. \\"Athenaeus.\\" LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢. N.p., n.d. Web. 14 Oct. 2016. First patents Athenaeus described what may be considered the first patents (i.e. exclusive right granted by a government to an inventor to practice his/her invention in exchange for disclosure of the invention). He mentions that several centuries BC, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy), there were annual culinary competitions. The victor was given the exclusive right to prepare his dish for one year. Such a thing would have been unusual at the time because Greek society at large did not recognize exclusivity in inventions or ideas.M.

For instance, Metsovo, a region which many people are Vlach-speaking even nowadays, appears without Vlach- speaking people at a1l. Thus, the pro-Albanian statistics of 1913 seem to be more as far as they are concerned.\\" but he also argues the study of Destani was pro-Albanian in motive and drastically undercounted the number of Greek speakers in the Himara and Leskovik kazas , while Psomas also excludes Kor√ß√´ from the collection of regions with notable Greek-speaking presencePsomas, Lambros (2008). The Religious and Ethnographic Synthesis of the Population of Southern Albania (Northern Epirus) in the Beginning of the 20th Century Page 250: \\" Greek-speaking people were located only in the cazas of Gjirokaster, Delvin and Himara, from the western part of Northern Epirus, and Leskovik, from the eastern. In all these cazas they constituted the majority of the Orthodox Christians (Table 2.1). Finally, there was a small minority of Vlach- speaking inhabitants in the cazas of Korcha and Permet. Surprisingly enough this, does not include the Slav-speaking Orthodox population of the caza of Starovo. Thus, except for the cazas in which a Greek-speaking population was located, the Albanian-speaking people were always the vast majority of the Ottoman cazas. This agrees with the English statistic of 1877, in which Albanians were always the population in advance.\\". British historian Tom Winnifrith states that during the delineation of the Greek-Albanian border a part of the local pro-Greek element included communities whose native speech was Greek. In 1919, US diplomat Joseph Emerson Haven on special detail in Albania wrote a detailed report regarding the political circumstances in the country. Haven wrote that the province of Kor√ß√´ numbered some 60,000 people of whom 18% had a preference for union with Greece and within that group half were doing so from fear or from being promised financial gain through attainment of Muslim properties and land. \\"One commissioner from the delegation Sederholm noted the population of Kor√ß√´ being ‚Äúentirely Albanian‚Äù with ‚Äúthe number of Greeks there‚Äù being ‚Äúquite insignificant‚Äù.... \\"Joseph Emerson Haven, a U.S. diplomat based in Italy on special detail in Albania during the spring of 1919, had already come to a similar conclusion. In his detailed report on the political situation in the country, Haven suggested that the disputed province of Kor√ß√´ had roughly 60,000 inhabitants, roughly 18 per cent of whom were in favour of Greek sovereignty. Of those 18 per cent, he argued, half were seeking that end out of fear or had been promised material gain in the form of Moslem land and property.... Haven found that the ‚Äòmost intense hatred and loathing exists in Southern Albania for Greece, this hatred being shown by both Orthodox Christians and Musselmen. The cry is ‚ÄúWe are Albanians first and religionists second.‚Äù With the exception of comparatively few residents in the province of Coritsa [Kor√ß√´] and a few towns in the region of Chimara [Himar√´], the country is absolutely Albanian in sentiment.\\" Haven also noted that in 1919 there was a degree of antipathy shown by both Muslims and Christians in the district toward Greece, and an ethnic affinity among Albanians that, at the time, came before religious affinity. At the Peace Conference in Paris, the Greek delegation argued that all Christians in North Epirus, including those that spoke Albanian, should be classified as Greeks because, they argued, their sentiments were Greek, and they had a common religion with Greeks; Lambros Psomas, however, argued that this did not apply in Kor√ß√´ kaza, where there were many Orthodox Albanian nationalists.Psomas, Lambros (2008). Synthesis of the Population of Southern Albania (Northern Epirus). Page 253, 268‚Äì269, 280 Demographics=Ethnicity= Most of the population of the district of Kor√ß√´ are ethnic Albanians, while a significant number of ethnic minorities (Aromanians) also inhabit the district. Aromanians are found residing in rural communities surrounding Kor√ß√´ and number some 5,000 people, although other figures exist that inflate those numbers. Greek speakers are found in the city of Kor√ß√´ as well as in the surrounding region and especially in Kor√ß√´ Plain. A Slavic minority most concentrated in the municipality of Pustec also exists, as does a scattered presence of Romani people. =Religion= The religious composition of the district of Kor√ß√´ consists of Muslims and Orthodox Christians while the Muslims are divided between Sunni, Bektashi and Halveti groups. Additionally, among the Christians, there is a presence of Protestants, dating back to the actions of Gjerasim Qiriazi. Finally, a presence of Catholics was detected in the 2011 census. Economy During the 20th century, Kor√ß√´ gained a substantial industrial capacity in addition to its historic role as a commercial and agricultural centre. The plateau on which the city stands is highly fertile and is one of Albania's main wheat-growing areas. Local industries include the manufacture of knitwear, rugs, textiles, flour-milling, brewing, and sugar- refining. Deposits of lignite coal are mined in the mountains nearby such as Mborje-Drenov√´.

Markov originally worked as a novelist and playwright in his native country, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, until his defection in 1968. After relocating to London, he worked as a broadcaster and journalist for the BBC World Service, the US-funded Radio Free Europe and West Germany's Deutsche Welle. Markov used such forums to conduct a campaign of sarcastic criticism against the incumbent Bulgarian regime, which, according to his wife at the time he died, eventually became \\"vitriolic\\" and included \\"really smearing mud on the people in the inner circles\\". Georgi Markov was assassinated on a London street via a micro-engineered pellet containing ricin, fired into his leg from an umbrella wielded by someone associated with the Bulgarian Secret Service. It has been speculated that they asked the KGB for help.  Life in Bulgaria  Georgi Markov was born on 1 March 1929, in Knyazhevo, a Sofia neighbourhood. In 1946, he graduated from the Gymnasium (high school) and began university studies in industrial chemistry. Initially, Markov worked as a chemical engineer and a teacher in a technical school. At the age of 19 years he became ill with tuberculosis which forced him to attend various hospitals. His first literary attempts occurred during that time. In 1957, a novel, The Night of Caesium, appeared. Soon another novel, The Ajax Winners (1959), and two collections of short stories (1961) were published. In 1962, Markov published the novel Men which won the annual award of the Union of Bulgarian Writers and he was subsequently accepted as a member of the Union, a prerequisite for a professional career in literature. Georgi Markov started working at the Narodna Mladezh Publishing house. The story collections A Portrait of My Double (1966) and The Women of Warsaw (1968) secured his place as one of the most talented young writers of Bulgaria. Markov also wrote a number of plays but most of them were never staged or were removed from theatre repertoire by the Communist censors: To Crawl Under the Rainbow, The Elevator, Assassination in the Cul-de-Sac, Stalinists, and I Was Him. The novel The Roof was halted in mid-printing since it described as a fact and in allegorical terms the collapse of the roof of the Lenin steel mill. Markov was one of the authors of the popular TV series Every Kilometer (–í—Å–µ–∫–∏ –∫–∏–ª–æ–º–µ—Ç—ä—Ä or At Every Milestone) which created the character of the Second World War detective Velinsky and his nemesis the Resistance fighter Deyanov. Despite some of his works being banned, Georgi Markov had become a successful author. He was among the writers and poets that Todor Zhivkov tried to co-opt and coerce into serving the regime with their works. During this period Markov had a bohemian lifestyle, which was unknown to most Bulgarians.  Writer and dissident  In 1969, Markov left for Bologna, Italy, where his brother lived. His initial idea was to wait until his status with the Bulgarian authorities improved, but he gradually changed his mind and decided to stay in the West, especially after September 1971 when the Bulgarian government refused to extend his passport. Markov moved to London, where he learned English and started working for the Bulgarian section of the BBC World Service (1972). He tried to work for the film industry, hoping for help from Peter Uvaliev, but was unsuccessful. Later he also worked with Deutsche Welle and Radio Free Europe. In 1972, Markov's membership in the Union of Bulgarian Writers was suspended and he was sentenced in absentia to six years and six months in prison for his defection. His works were withdrawn from libraries and bookshops and his name was not mentioned by the official Bulgarian media until 1989. The Bulgarian Secret Service opened a file on Markov file under the code name \\"Wanderer\\". In 1974, his play To Crawl Under the Rainbow was staged in London, while in Edinburgh the play Archangel Michael, written in English, won first prize. The novel The Right Honourable Chimpanzee, co-written with David Phillips, was published after his death. In 1975, Markov married Annabel Dilke. The couple had a daughter, Alexandra-Raina, born a year later. Between 1975 and 1978, Markov worked on his In Absentia Reports, an analysis of life in Communist Bulgaria. They were broadcast weekly on Radio Free Europe. Their criticism of the Communist government and of the Party leader Todor Zhivkov made Markov even more an enemy of the regime. In 1978, Markov was killed in London (see below) by an operative connected to the KGB and the Bulgarian secret police under Zhivkov. His In Absentia Reports were published in Bulgaria in 1990, after the end of the Communist government. In 2000, Markov was posthumously awarded the Order of Stara Planina, Bulgaria's most prestigious honour, for his \\"significant contribution to the Bulgarian literature, drama and non-fiction and for his exceptional civic position and confrontation to the Communist regime.\\"  Assassination  On 7 September 1978, Markov walked across Waterloo Bridge spanning the River Thames, and waited to take a bus to his job at the BBC. While at the bus stop, he felt a slight sharp pain, as a bug bite or sting, on the back of his right thigh. He looked behind him and saw a man picking up an umbrella off the ground. The man hurriedly crossed to the other side of the street and got in a taxi which then drove away. The event is recalled as the \\"Umbrella Murder\\". When he arrived at work at the BBC World Service offices, Markov noticed a small red pimple had formed at the site of the sting he had felt earlier and the pain had not lessened or stopped. He told at least one of his colleagues at the BBC about this incident. That evening he developed a fever and was admitted to St James' Hospital in Balham, where he died four days later, on 11 September 1978, at the age of 49. The cause of death was poisoning from a ricin-filled pellet. Markov's grave is in a small churchyard at the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross in Whitchurch Canonicorum, Dorset. = Later investigation and aftermath = Due to the circumstances and statements Markov made to doctors expressing the suspicion that he had been poisoned, the Metropolitan Police ordered a thorough autopsy of Markov's body. Dr Bernard Riley, a forensic pathologist, discovered a spherical metal pellet the size of a pin-head embedded in Markov's leg. The pellet measured in diameter and was composed of 90% platinum and 10% iridium. It had two holes with diameters of drilled through it, producing an X-shaped cavity. Further examination by experts from Porton Down showed that the pellet contained traces of toxic ricin. A sugary substance coated the tiny holes creating a bubble which trapped the ricin inside the cavities. The specially crafted coating was designed to melt at : human body temperature. After the pellet was shot into Markov, the coating melted and the ricin was free to be absorbed into the bloodstream and kill him. Regardless of whether the doctors treating Markov had known that the poison was ricin, the result would have been the same, as there was no known antidote to ricin at the time. A diagram of a possible umbrella gun Ten days before the murder, an attempt was made to kill another Bulgarian defector, Vladimir Kostov, in the same manner as Markov, in a Paris metro station.John D. Bell, Bulgaria in Transition:Politics, Economics, Society, and Culture after Communism, Westview Press, Boulder, 1998, p.251. KGB defector Oleg Kalugin confirmed that the KGB arranged the murder, even presenting the Bulgarian assassin with alternatives such as a poisonous jelly to smear on Markov's skin, but to date no one has been charged with Markov's murder, largely because most documents relating to it are unavailable, probably destroyed. The British newspaper The Times has reported that the prime suspect is an Italian named Francesco Gullino (or Giullino) who was last known to be living in Denmark.Times Online(UK) article revealing Giullino as the umbrella killer by Jack Hamilton and Tom Walker. 5 June 2005 A British documentary, The Umbrella Assassin (2006), interviewed people associated with the case in Bulgaria, Britain, Denmark and America, and revealed that the prime suspect, Gullino, is alive and well, and still travelling freely throughout Europe. There were reports in June 2008 that Scotland Yard had renewed its interest in the case. Detectives were sent to Bulgaria and requests were made to interview relevant individuals. In August 2018 the case was the subject of the BBC Radio 4 programme The Reunion. = Similar attack = On 11 May 2012, a German man (not named in press reports) died almost a year after being stabbed with an umbrella in the city of Hanover. German police ‚Äì who noted a resemblance to the Markov case ‚Äì believe the umbrella was used to inject mercury, and the reported cause of death was mercury poisoning.\\"Umbrella stab victim dies of mercury poisoning\\", article reporting the second (2011, with death occurring in 2012) incident (in English.) 11 May 2012 www.thelocal.de, accessed 3 September 2020\\"Quecksilbervergiftung\\", tr.

Their music combines electronic keyboards and surf guitar, creating a unique ghostly sound. History The Chantays were formed in 1961 by five high-school friends. Bob Spickard, Brian Carman (co-writers of \\"Pipeline\\"), Bob Welch, Warren Waters and Rob Marshall were all students at Santa Ana High School in California. In December 1962, the group recorded and released \\"Pipeline\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May 1963. The track also peaked in the UK Singles Chart in 1963 at No. 16. The Chantays recorded their first album in 1963, also titled Pipeline, which included \\"Blunderbus\\" and \\"El Conquistador\\". Their follow-up album was Two Sides of the Chantays in 1964. The Chantays toured Japan and the United States, joining the Righteous Brothers and Roy Orbison on a few occasions, and they were the only rock and roll band to perform on The Lawrence Welk Show. \\"Pipeline\\" (published as sheet music in 1962 by Downey Music Publishing) has become one of several surf rock hits. The tune has since been covered by Bruce Johnston, Welk (on the Dot album Scarlet O'Hara), Al Caiola (on the United Artists album Greasy Kid Stuff), the Ventures, Takeshi Terauchi & Blue Jeans, Agent Orange, Hank Marvin, Lively Ones, Pat Metheny, Dick Dale with the help of Stevie Ray Vaughan (Grammy Nominated), by the thrash metal band Anthrax, Bad Manners and Johnny Thunders. \\"Pipeline\\" has been used in many films, television programs and commercials, and appears on numerous compilation albums. The Chantays have been honored for their contributions to music. Highlights include being honored on April 12, 1996, by Hollywood's Rock Walk, that was founded to honor individuals and bands that have made lasting and important contributions to music. \\"Pipeline\\" is listed as one of the 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. Along with Bill Medley of the Righteous Brothers and Diane Keaton, the Chantays were honored by the City of Santa Ana, California, and Santa Ana High School when they named a street after them, Chantays Way. OC Weekly magazine also named the Chantays as one of the Best Orange County Bands. The Chantays are still playing. Original members Bob Spickard and Bob Welch are joined by longtime members Ricky Lewis and Brian Nussle. More recent albums include The Next Set (live recording) and Waiting for the Tide. Some of the tracks are the new songs \\"Crystal T\\" and \\"Killer Dana\\", along with remakes of \\"Pipeline\\", \\"El Conquistador\\" and \\"Blunderbus\\".

It lies between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss border; it forms part of the metropolitan area of Geneva. In 2017, it had a population of 9,766. History Ferney was first noted in 14th-century Burgundian registers as \\"Fernex\\" and changed several times until the 19th century to Fernay, Fernaj, Fernai or Fernex before adopting its current name as 'Ferney-Voltaire' in 1791, after the French Revolution which saw a number of city names unchristened and turned into more republican. During Voltaire's residence in Ferney in the second part of the 18th century, the town saw rapid expansion. Today Ferney is a peaceful town with a Saturday market and a large international community, due to the proximity of CERN and the United Nations Office at Geneva. Ferney is growing very quickly. It is also home to the Lyc√©e International. Voltaire still presides over Ferney with his statue in the center of town. Voltaire Statue of Voltaire in town's center From 1759 to 1778 Ferney was home to French writer and philosopher Voltaire, sometimes referred to as \\"the patriarch of Ferney.\\" His influence on the town was profound. He built the local church and founded cottage industries that produced some of the finest potters and watchmakers of modern France. The town was eventually renamed \\"Ferney-Voltaire\\" in his honor. In 1759, after having lived in Geneva less than two years, Voltaire purchased the estate of Ferney in France, near the Swiss border. A prime reason for his leaving Geneva was that theatre was forbidden in that Calvinist city, so he had decided to become the enlightened \\"patriarch\\" of the little village of Ferney, setting up potteries, a watchmaking industry and, of course, theaters, attracting rich people from Geneva to watch his plays. During Voltaire's residence, the population of Ferney increased to more than 1,000. Voltaire lived there for the last 20 years of his life before returning to Paris, where he died in 1778. PopulationSchools √âcole Florian The community has two public preschools/primary schools: √âcole Jean-Calas and √âcole Florian. A nearby intercommunal school, √âcole Intercommunale Jean de la Fontaine in Pr√©vessin- Mo√´ns, also serves the community. the three schools had a combined total of 952 students, with Jean-Calas, Florian, and Jean de la Fontaine respectively having 278, 307, and 367 students.\\"Maternelles et √©l√©mentaires.\\" Ferney- Voltaire. Retrieved on 10 November 2018. Around 1940 a primary school, the √âcole de Ferney-Voltaire, was established. About 1970 it was renamed √âcole Florian, after the French poet and fabulist Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian, whose uncle and guardian, the Marquis de Florian, had married a niece of Voltaire. The school is notable for having had a large number of pupils who were children of physicists at CERN, which is located in the vicinity.

Lyc√©e international de Ferney-Voltaire, including a junior high school/middle school (coll√®ge) and a senior high school/sixth form college (lyc√©e) was created in 1961 in Ferney-Voltaire. As of 2016, the Lyc√©e includes a branch campus in Saint-Genis-Pouilly. Sights Voltaire's chateau Ferney's main attraction is Voltaire's house (ch√¢teau), built 1758‚Äì66, now owned and administered by the Centre des monuments nationaux (an arm of the French Ministry of Culture). It is open to visitors between May and September. The Ch√¢teau Voltaire includes the main building, with a reconstruction of Voltaire's room (moved from its original location by later private owners), a garden with a fine view of the Alps, and a church dedicated, contrary to custom, directly to God. In the church's inscription, \\"Deo erexit VOLTAIRE\\" (\\"Erected to God by VOLTAIRE\\"), Voltaire's name is written in the largest characters. A few dozen meters from the chateau is another impressive house, built in 1900 by Monsieur Lambert (the sculptor of the statue of Voltaire; his family owned the chateau before it was purchased by the French government). The house, now privately owned, had been used to store provisions and wine for the chateau, and to accommodate the household staff. The village features 18th-century houses and artisans' workshops; a life-size statue of Voltaire; a smaller bust of him, surmounting a fountain; many restaurants, French and foreign; and proximity to the nearby cosmopolitan city of Geneva, Switzerland. Every Saturday, a market is held in the main street of Ferney. The old road at the centre of the village is a remnant of the time when Voltaire resided at the chateau in Ferney-Voltaire. The pedestal of the Voltaire statue, erected in 1890, dedicates that memorial to the town's \\"benefactor,\\" noting that he built over a hundred houses for the inhabitants, as well as a school and church, gave the town interest-free loans, and fed its inhabitants in time of need. On the 31st of May 2018, Pr√©sident Emmanuel Macron officially visited the Ch√¢teau for the re-opening after renovation.

This functor makes it possible to think of the objects of the category as sets with additional structure, and of its morphisms as structure-preserving functions. Many important categories have obvious interpretations as concrete categories, for example the category of topological spaces and the category of groups, and trivially also the category of sets itself. On the other hand, the homotopy category of topological spaces is not concretizable, i.e. it does not admit a faithful functor to the category of sets. A concrete category, when defined without reference to the notion of a category, consists of a class of objects, each equipped with an underlying set; and for any two objects A and B a set of functions, called morphisms, from the underlying set of A to the underlying set of B. Furthermore, for every object A, the identity function on the underlying set of A must be a morphism from A to A, and the composition of a morphism from A to B followed by a morphism from B to C must be a morphism from A to C.  Definition  A concrete category is a pair (C,U) such that *C is a category, and *U : C ‚Üí Set (the category of sets and functions) is a faithful functor. The functor U is to be thought of as a forgetful functor, which assigns to every object of C its \\"underlying set\\", and to every morphism in C its \\"underlying function\\". A category C is concretizable if there exists a concrete category (C,U); i.e., if there exists a faithful functor U: C ‚Üí Set. All small categories are concretizable: define U so that its object part maps each object b of C to the set of all morphisms of C whose codomain is b (i.e. all morphisms of the form f: a ‚Üí b for any object a of C), and its morphism part maps each morphism g: b ‚Üí c of C to the function U(g): U(b) ‚Üí U(c) which maps each member f: a ‚Üí b of U(b) to the composition gf: a ‚Üí c, a member of U(c). (Item 6 under Further examples expresses the same U in less elementary language via presheaves.) The Counter-examples section exhibits two large categories that are not concretizable.  Remarks  It is important to note that, contrary to intuition, concreteness is not a property which a category may or may not satisfy, but rather a structure with which a category may or may not be equipped. In particular, a category C may admit several faithful functors into Set. Hence there may be several concrete categories (C, U) all corresponding to the same category C. In practice, however, the choice of faithful functor is often clear and in this case we simply speak of the \\"concrete category C\\". For example, \\"the concrete category Set\\" means the pair (Set, I) where I denotes the identity functor Set ‚Üí Set. The requirement that U be faithful means that it maps different morphisms between the same objects to different functions. However, U may map different objects to the same set and, if this occurs, it will also map different morphisms to the same function. For example, if S and T are two different topologies on the same set X, then (X, S) and (X, T) are distinct objects in the category Top of topological spaces and continuous maps, but mapped to the same set X by the forgetful functor Top ‚Üí Set. Moreover, the identity morphism (X, S) ‚Üí (X, S) and the identity morphism (X, T) ‚Üí (X, T) are considered distinct morphisms in Top, but they have the same underlying function, namely the identity function on X. Similarly, any set with four elements can be given two non-isomorphic group structures: one isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z}, and the other isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Z}/4\\\\mathbb{Z}.  Further examples  # Any group G may be regarded as an \\"abstract\\" category with one arbitrary object, \\\\ast, and one morphism for each element of the group. This would not be counted as concrete according to the intuitive notion described at the top of this article. But every faithful G-set (equivalently, every representation of G as a group of permutations) determines a faithful functor G ‚Üí Set. Since every group acts faithfully on itself, G can be made into a concrete category in at least one way. # Similarly, any poset P may be regarded as an abstract category with a unique arrow x ‚Üí y whenever x ‚â§ y. This can be made concrete by defining a functor D : P ‚Üí Set which maps each object x to D(x)=\\\\\\\\{a \\\\in P : a \\\\leq x\\\\\\\\} and each arrow x ‚Üí y to the inclusion map D(x) \\\\hookrightarrow D(y). # The category Rel whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are relations can be made concrete by taking U to map each set X to its power set 2^X and each relation R \\\\subseteq X \\\\times Y to the function \\\\rho: 2^X \\\\rightarrow 2^Y defined by \\\\rho(A)=\\\\\\\\{y \\\\in Y \\\\mid \\\\exists \\\\, x \\\\in A : xRy\\\\\\\\}. Noting that power sets are complete lattices under inclusion, those functions between them arising from some relation R in this way are exactly the supremum-preserving maps. Hence Rel is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category Sup of complete lattices and their sup- preserving maps. Conversely, starting from this equivalence we can recover U as the composite Rel ‚Üí Sup ‚Üí Set of the forgetful functor for Sup with this embedding of Rel in Sup. # The category Setop can be embedded into Rel by representing each set as itself and each function f: X ‚Üí Y as the relation from Y to X formed as the set of pairs (f(x), x) for all x ‚àà X; hence Setop is concretizable. The forgetful functor which arises in this way is the contravariant powerset functor Setop ‚Üí Set. # It follows from the previous example that the opposite of any concretizable category C is again concretizable, since if U is a faithful functor C ‚Üí Set then Cop may be equipped with the composite Cop ‚Üí Setop ‚Üí Set. # If C is any small category, then there exists a faithful functor P : SetCop ‚Üí Set which maps a presheaf X to the coproduct \\\\coprod_{c \\\\in \\\\mathrm{ob}C} X(c). By composing this with the Yoneda embedding Y:C ‚Üí SetCop one obtains a faithful functor C ‚Üí Set. # For technical reasons, the category Ban1 of Banach spaces and linear contractions is often equipped not with the \\"obvious\\" forgetful functor but the functor U1 : Ban1 ‚Üí Set which maps a Banach space to its (closed) unit ball. #The category Cat whose objects are small categories and whose morphisms are functors can be made concrete by sending each category C to the set containing its objects and morphisms. Functors can be simply viewed as functions acting on the objects and morphisms.  Counter-examples  The category hTop, where the objects are topological spaces and the morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous functions, is an example of a category that is not concretizable. While the objects are sets (with additional structure), the morphisms are not actual functions between them, but rather classes of functions. The fact that there does not exist any faithful functor from hTop to Set was first proven by Peter Freyd. In the same article, Freyd cites an earlier result that the category of \\"small categories and natural equivalence-classes of functors\\" also fails to be concretizable.  Implicit structure of concrete categories  Given a concrete category (C, U) and a cardinal number N, let UN be the functor C ‚Üí Set determined by UN(c) = (U(c))N. Then a subfunctor of UN is called an N-ary predicate and a natural transformation UN ‚Üí U an N-ary operation. The class of all N-ary predicates and N-ary operations of a concrete category (C,U), with N ranging over the class of all cardinal numbers, forms a large signature. The category of models for this signature then contains a full subcategory which is equivalent to C.  Relative concreteness  In some parts of category theory, most notably topos theory, it is common to replace the category Set with a different category X, often called a base category. For this reason, it makes sense to call a pair (C, U) where C is a category and U a faithful functor C ‚Üí X a concrete category over X. For example, it may be useful to think of the models of a theory with N sorts as forming a concrete category over SetN. In this context, a concrete category over Set is sometimes called a construct.

It was located in what is now northern Algeria.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 950  History  Map of Roman North Africa Parthenia is one of the Maghreb cities of the Roman period whose toponym recalls the cognomen of a prominent family; usually of the patrician class, in this case the family of the Parthenii. The Notitia Provinciarum et Civitatum Africae, part of Victor Vitensis's Historia persecutionis Africanae Provinciae, temporibus Geiserici et Hunirici regum Wandalorum, mentions Parthenia among the bishoprics of Mauretania Sitifensis. It says that the bishop Rogatus was one of those exiled by the Vandal king Huneric when he took action against the Catholic bishops in his dominions. Morcelli remarks that he could find no other mention of Parthenia in the works of the ancient geographers or other writers. A writer on the website Partenia places the site of the ancient town and bishopric that it calls Partenia in modern S√©tif Province, directly south of the city of S√©tif, but says the town's exact location is unknown, since it has disappeared beneath the sand. No other map of Roman North Africa attempts to indicate where it stood. The detailed map of ancient Africa and Mauretania made available on the Internet by the Associazione Storico-Culturale S. Agostino shows no town of similar name. The name that comes closest (in that it includes four of the nine letters of the word \\"Parthenia\\" but obviously has no relation to the Parthenii family) is \\"Ad Partum\\" in an 1842 map of ancient Africa, Numidia, and part of Mauretania by the father and son Lapie. Ad Partum lay to the east of ancient Setifis, southeast of Cuiculum and southwest of Cirta.  Bishopric  Parthenia is also a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church.Anno Pontificio 20B (Libre Editria Vaticano, 2013) p950. It could be described as the most active titular see in the world due to the online activities of its current bishop, Jacques Gaillot. In February 484, Rogatus, Bishop of Parthenia, was one of the Catholic bishops whom the Arian Vandal Huneric summoned to a meeting at Carthage and then exiled. No longer a residential bishopric, Parthenia is now listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. =Past bishops= * Victor fl * Ragatus fl. 484 * Giovanni Fallani (1964‚Äì1985) * Jos√© Luis Lacunza Maestroju√°n (1985‚Äì1994) * Jacques Gaillot (1995‚Äìcurrent)Parthenia at Catholic-Hierarchy.  Virtual see of Partenia  Logo of the Internet site of Partenia The titular see of Parthenia was assigned to Bishop Jacques Gaillot when he was transferred on 13 January 1995 from the residential diocese of √âvreux in France. Gaillot had been noted for his public expression of support for controversial church critic Eugen Drewermann,Eugen Drewermann, Jacques Gaillot, Der Traum von Menschlichkeit, ed. by Peter Eicher. K√∂sel, 1997; . married priests and the use of condoms and for taking a lenient view with regard to homosexual activity and procurement of abortion. The other French bishops complained to him for breaching the confidentiality of the meetings of the episcopal conference and for voicing positions contrary to the Church's magisterium. The president of the conference appealed to him, \\"if not to retract, then at least to cease making declarations opposed to the teachings and doctrine of the Catholic Church\\". On his removal from the see of √âvreux, Gaillot established an Internet site, called \\"Partenia\\", the Italian version of the name of his titular see, in which to express his ideas, but ceased to write on it in 2010.

During the ensuing negotiations, the Swedish Attorney General, Lennart Geijer allowed Olsson's former cellmate and friend Clark Olofsson to be brought from prison to the bank. Olofsson was himself a long-time career criminal, but it is doubtful he was in league with Olsson. Famously, the hostages then bonded with their captors and acted to protect them despite their repeated threats to kill them all. Police finally mounted a tear gas attack five days into the crisis, and the robbers surrendered. Olsson was sentenced to 10 years for the robbery, while Olofsson was ultimately acquitted. The paradoxical actions of the hostages led to a great deal of academic and public interest in the case, including a 2003 Swedish television film and a 2018 Canadian film.  Events  Jan-Erik Olsson was on leave from prison on 23 August 1973 when he went into Kreditbanken at Norrmalmstorg, Stockholm and attempted to rob it. Swedish police were called in immediately; one of them went inside and Olsson opened fire, injuring the hand of police officer Ingemar Warpefeldt. He ordered the other officer to sit in a chair and \\"sing something\\", so the officer started singing \\"Lonesome Cowboy\\". Olsson then took four people as hostages. He demanded that his friend Clark Olofsson be brought there, along with three million Swedish kronor, two guns, bulletproof vests, helmets, and a fast car. He was a repeat offender who had committed several armed robberies and acts of violence, the first at age 16.40 √•r sedan Norrmalmstorgs dramat The government gave permission for Olofsson to be brought as a communication link with the police negotiators. Hostage Kristin Enmark said that she felt safe with Olsson and Olofsson, but she feared that the police might escalate the situation by using violent methods. Olsson and Olofsson barricaded the inner main vault in which they kept the hostages. Negotiators agreed that they could have a car to escape, but would not allow them to take hostages with them if they tried to leave. Olsson called Prime Minister Olof Palme and said that he would kill the hostages, backing up his threat by grabbing one in a stranglehold; she was heard screaming as he hung up. The next day, hostage Kristin Enmark called the Prime Minister and said that she was very displeased with his attitude, asking him to let the robbers and the hostages leave. Olofsson walked around the vault singing Roberta Flack's \\"Killing Me Softly\\". On August 26, the police drilled a hole into the main vault from the apartment above and took a widely circulated photograph of the hostages with Olofsson. Olofsson also fired his weapon into the hole on two occasions, wounding a police officer in the hand and face. Olsson fired his weapon and threatened to kill the hostages if any gas attack was attempted. On August 28, police used tear gas nevertheless, and Olsson and Olofsson surrendered after an hour. None of the hostages sustained permanent injuries. =After the robbery= Both Olsson and Olofsson were charged, convicted, and sentenced to extended prison terms for the robbery; Olofsson, however, claimed that he did not help Olsson and was only trying to save the hostages by keeping the situation calm. At the court of appeal, Olofsson's convictions were quashed. He later met hostage Kristin Enmark several times, their families becoming friends. He later committed further crimes. Olsson was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He received many admiring letters from women who found him attractive. (The woman he later got engaged to was not, as some state, one of the former hostages.) Following his release, he is alleged to have committed further crimes. After having been on the run from Swedish authorities for ten years for alleged financial crimes, he turned himself in to police in 2006‚Äîonly to be told that the charges were no longer being actively pursued. The hostages sympathized with their captors, which has led to academic interest in the matter. The Swedish term Norrmalmstorgssyndromet (Norrmalmstorg syndrome, later known as Stockholm syndrome) was coined by criminologist Nils Bejerot. The hostages, although threatened by Olsson, never became violent toward the police or each other. In 1996, Jan-Erik Olsson moved to northeastern Thailand with his Thai wife and son, and moved back to Sweden in 2013. Olsson's autobiography Stockholms-syndromet was published in Sweden in 2009. Popular culture The 2003 television film ', directed by H√•kan Lindh√©, is loosely based on the events. A fictionalized version of the robbery is told in Stockholm, a 2018 film directed by Robert Budreau.

Biography  Collins became known to viewers in her native Mexico as a reporter of \\"Televisa 24 horas\\" (1974), Noticiero con Jacobo Zabludovsky. In 1979 Collins was sent by Televisa as their first correspondent in California where she began as a general assignment journalist also covering baseball in the Major Leagues with the San Diego Padres and the Los Angeles Dodgers, job she did until 1986. Later that year was transferred to Spanish International Network (SIN) the network later named Univision. In eighteen years in Univision Network Collins was well known for her job as a Mexico Correspondent, Texas Correspondent, and International Correspondent. In 1993 was appointed as the successor of Mar√≠a Celeste Arrar√°s as the weekend anchor of Noticiero Univision, covering Jorge Ramos and Mar√≠a Elena Salinas while they were out. In 2000 was named Senior Correspondent for the news magazine \\"Aqui y Ahora\\" position that with Noticiero Univision fin de semana hold it until she left the network in August 2005. After Univision, Collins went to Telemundo where she hosted the morning show \\"Cada Dia\\". Collins underwent plastic surgery in 2004 and has spoken extensively about it.

Incidence in epidemiology is a measure of the probability of occurrence of a given medical condition in a population within a specified period of time. Although sometimes loosely expressed simply as the number of new cases during some time period, it is better expressed as a proportion or a rate with a denominator. Incidence proportion (also known as cumulative incidence) is the number of new cases within a specified time period divided by the size of the population initially at risk. For example, if a population initially contains 1,000 non-diseased persons and 28 develop a condition over two years of observation, the incidence proportion is 28 cases per 1,000 persons per two years, i.e. 2.8% per two years. Incidence rate The incidence rate is a measure of the frequency with which a disease or other incident occurs over a specified time period. When the denominator is the product of the person-time of the at risk population, it is also known as the incidence density rate or person-time incidence rate. In the same example as above, the incidence rate is 14 cases per 1000 person-years, because the incidence proportion (28 per 1,000) is divided by the number of years (two). Using person-time rather than just time handles situations where the amount of observation time differs between people, or when the population at risk varies with time. Use of this measure implies the assumption that the incidence rate is constant over different periods of time, such that for an incidence rate of 14 per 1000 persons-years, 14 cases would be expected for 1000 persons observed for 1 year or 50 persons observed for 20 years. When this assumption is substantially violated, such as in describing survival after diagnosis of metastatic cancer, it may be more useful to present incidence data in a plot of cumulative incidence, over time, taking into account loss to follow-up, using a Kaplan-Meier Plot. Consider the following example. Say you are looking at a sample population of 225 people, and want to determine the incidence rate of developing HIV over a 10-year period: * At the beginning of the study (t=0) you find 25 cases of existing HIV. These people are not counted as they cannot develop HIV a second time. * A follow-up at 5 years (t=5 years) finds 20 new cases of HIV. * A second follow-up at the end of the study (t=10 years) finds 30 new cases. If you were to measure prevalence you would simply take the total number of cases (25 + 20 + 30 = 75) and divide by your sample population (225). So prevalence would be 75/225 = 0.33 or 33% (by the end of the study). This tells you how widespread HIV is in your sample population, but little about the actual risk of developing HIV for any person over a coming year. To measure incidence you must take into account how many years each person contributed to the study, and when they developed HIV. When it is not known exactly when a person develops the disease in question, epidemiologists frequently use the actuarial method, and assume it was developed at a half-way point between follow-ups.[citation needed] In this calculation: * At 5 yrs you found 20 new cases, so you assume they developed HIV at 2.5 years, thus contributing (20 * 2.5) =50 person-years of disease-free life. * At 10 years you found 30 new cases. These people did not have HIV at 5 years, but did at 10, so you assume they were infected at 7.5 years, thus contributing (30 * 7.5)= 225 person-years of disease-free life. That is a total of (225 + 50)= 275 person years so far. * You also want to account for the 150 people who never had or developed HIV over the 10-year period, (150 * 10) contributing 1500 person-years of disease-free life. That is a total of (1500 + 275) = 1775 person-years of life. Now take the 50 new cases of HIV, and divide by 1775 to get 0.028, or 28 cases of HIV per 1000 population, per year. In other words, if you were to follow 1000 people for one year, you would see 28 new cases of HIV. This is a much more accurate measure of risk than prevalence. Incidence vs. prevalence Incidence should not be confused with prevalence, which is the proportion of cases in the population at a given time rather than rate of occurrence of new cases. Thus, incidence conveys information about the risk of contracting the disease, whereas prevalence indicates how widespread the disease is. Prevalence is the proportion of the total number of cases to the total population and is more a measure of the burden of the disease on society with no regard to time at risk or when subjects may have been exposed to a possible risk factor. Prevalence can also be measured with respect to a specific subgroup of a population (see: denominator data). Incidence is usually more useful than prevalence in understanding the disease etiology: for example, if the incidence rate of a disease in a population increases, then there is a risk factor that promotes the incidence. For example, consider a disease that takes a long time to cure and was widespread in 2002 but dissipated in 2003. This disease will have both high incidence and high prevalence in 2002, but in 2003 it will have a low incidence yet will continue to have a high prevalence (because it takes a long time to cure, so the fraction of individuals that are affected remains high). In contrast, a disease that has a short duration may have a low prevalence and a high incidence. When the incidence is approximately constant for the duration of the disease, prevalence is approximately the product of disease incidence and average disease duration, so prevalence = incidence √ó duration. The importance of this equation is in the relation between prevalence and incidence; for example, when the incidence increases, then the prevalence must also increase. Note that this relation does not hold for age-specific prevalence and incidence, where the relation becomes more complicated.Brinks R (2011) \\"A new method for deriving incidence rates from prevalence data and its application to dementia in Germany\\", See also * Attributable risk * Denominator data ReferencesExternal links *Calculation of standardized incidence rate *PAMCOMP Person-Years Analysis and Computation Programme for calculating standardized incidence rates (SIRs) Category:Epidemiology Category:Medical statistics Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Hygiene ","title":"Incidence (epidemiology)"},{"id":"167009","text":"This is an incomplete list of festivals in Canada.

Persian carpet, Tabriz, mid-16th century Hunters at a Stream - Riza \`Abbasi, c.1625 Brooklyn Museum Islamic art encompasses the visual arts produced in the Islamic world.Marilyn Jenkins-Madina, Richard Ettinghausen and Oleg Grabar, 2001, Islamic Art and Architecture: 650‚Äì1250, Yale University Press, , p.3; Brend, 10 Islamic art is difficult to characterize because it covers a wide range of lands, periods, and genres, including Islamic architecture, Islamic calligraphy, Islamic miniature, Islamic glass, Islamic pottery, and textile arts such as carpets and embroidery. It comprises both religious and secular art forms. Religious art is represented by calligraphy, architecture and furnishings of religious buildings, such as mosque fittings (e.g., mosque lamps and Girih tiles), woodwork and carpets. Secular art also flourished in the Islamic world, although some of its elements were criticized by religious scholars.Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, pg. 277 Early development of Islamic art was influenced by Roman art, Early Christian art (particularly Byzantine art), and Sassanian art, with later influences from Central Asian nomadic traditions. Chinese art had a formative influence on Islamic painting, pottery, and textiles. Though the concept of \\"Islamic art\\" has been criticised by some modern art historians as an illusory Eurocentric construct, the similarities between art produced at widely different times and places in the Islamic world, especially in the Islamic Golden Age, have been sufficient to keep the term in wide use by scholars. Islamic art is often characterized by recurrent motifs, such as the use of geometrical floral or vegetal designs in a repetition known as the arabesque. The arabesque in Islamic art is often used to symbolize the transcendent, indivisible and infinite nature of God.Madden (1975), pp.423‚Äì430 Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only God can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed. Some interpretations of Islam include a ban of depiction of animate beings, also known as aniconism. Islamic aniconism stems in part from the prohibition of idolatry and in part from the belief that creation of living forms is God's prerogative. Muslims have interpreted these prohibitions in different ways in different times and places. Religious Islamic art has been typically characterized by the absence of figures and extensive use of calligraphic, geometric and abstract floral patterns. However, representations of Islamic religious figures are found in some manuscripts from Persianate cultures, including Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India. These pictures were meant to illustrate the story and not to infringe on the Islamic prohibition of idolatry, but many Muslims regard such images as forbidden. In secular art of the Muslim world, representations of human and animal forms historically flourished in nearly all Islamic cultures, although, partly because of opposing religious sentiments, figures in paintings were often stylized, giving rise to a variety of decorative figural designs.  Calligraphy  Tiles with some calligraphy in the courtyard of the S√ºleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul (Turkey) Calligraphic design is omnipresent in Islamic art, where, as in Europe in the Middle Ages, religious exhortations, including Qur'anic verses, may be included in secular objects, especially coins, tiles and metalwork, and most painted miniatures include some script, as do many buildings. Use of Islamic calligraphy in architecture extended significantly outside of Islamic territories; one notable example is the use of Chinese calligraphy of Arabic verses from the Qur'an in the Great Mosque of Xi'an. Other inscriptions include verses of poetry, and inscriptions recording ownership or donation. Two of the main scripts involved are the symbolic kufic and naskh scripts, which can be found adorning and enhancing the visual appeal of the walls and domes of buildings, the sides of minbars, and metalwork. Islamic calligraphy in the form of painting or sculptures are sometimes referred to as quranic art.Islamic Archaeology in the Sudan - Page 22, Intisar Soghayroun Elzein - 2004 East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \\"epigraphic ware\\", has been described as \\"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\\".Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278‚Äì290 Large inscriptions made from tiles, sometimes with the letters raised in relief, or the background cut away, are found on the interiors and exteriors of many important buildings. Complex carved calligraphy also decorates buildings. For most of the Islamic period the majority of coins only showed lettering, which are often very elegant despite their small size and nature of production. The tughra or monogram of an Ottoman sultan was used extensively on official documents, with very elaborate decoration for important ones. Other single sheets of calligraphy, designed for albums, might contain short poems, Qur'anic verses, or other texts. The main languages, all using Arabic script, are Arabic, always used for Qur'anic verses, Persian in the Persianate world, especially for poetry, and Turkish, with Urdu appearing in later centuries. Calligraphers usually had a higher status than other artists.  Painting  Scene from the Khamsa of Nizami, Persian, 1539‚Äì43 Although there has been a tradition of wall- paintings, especially in the Persianate world, the best-surviving and highest developed form of painting in the Islamic world is the miniature in illuminated manuscripts, or later as a single page for inclusion in a muraqqa or bound album of miniatures and calligraphy. The tradition of the Persian miniature has been dominant since about the 13th century, strongly influencing the Ottoman miniature of Turkey and the Mughal miniature in India. Miniatures were especially an art of the court, and because they were not seen in public, it has been argued that constraints on the depiction of the human figure were much more relaxed, and indeed miniatures often contain great numbers of small figures, and from the 16th century portraits of single ones. Although surviving early examples are now uncommon, human figurative art was a continuous tradition in Islamic lands in secular contexts, notably several of the Umayyad Desert Castles (c. 660-750), and during the Abbasid Caliphate (c. 749‚Äì1258). The largest commissions of illustrated books were usually classics of Persian poetry such as the epic Shahnameh, although the Mughals and Ottomans both produced lavish manuscripts of more recent history with the autobiographies of the Mughal emperors, and more purely military chronicles of Turkish conquests. Portraits of rulers developed in the 16th century, and later in Persia, then becoming very popular. Mughal portraits, normally in profile, are very finely drawn in a realist style, while the best Ottoman ones are vigorously stylized. Album miniatures typically featured picnic scenes, portraits of individuals or (in India especially) animals, or idealized youthful beauties of either sex. Chinese influences included the early adoption of the vertical format natural to a book, which led to the development of a birds-eye view where a very carefully depicted background of hilly landscape or palace buildings rises up to leave only a small area of sky. The figures are arranged in different planes on the background, with recession (distance from the viewer) indicated by placing more distant figures higher up in the space, but at essentially the same size. The colours, which are often very well preserved, are strongly contrasting, bright and clear. The tradition reached a climax in the 16th and early 17th centuries, but continued until the early 19th century, and has been revived in the 20th.  Rugs and carpets  From the yarn fiber to the colors, every part of the Persian rug is traditionally handmade from natural ingredients over the course of many months No Islamic artistic product has become better known outside the Islamic world than the pile carpet, more commonly referred to as the Oriental carpet (oriental rug). Their versatility is utilized in everyday Islamic and Muslim life, from floor coverings to architectural enrichment, from cushions to bolsters to bags and sacks of all shapes and sizes, and to religious objects (such as a prayer rug, which would provide a clean place to pray). They have been a major export to other areas since the late Middle Ages, used to cover not only floors but tables, for long a widespread European practice that is now common only in the Netherlands. Carpet weaving is a rich and deeply embedded tradition in Islamic societies, and the practice is seen in large city factories as well as in rural communities and nomadic encampments. In earlier periods, special establishments and workshops were in existence that functioned directly under court patronage.Davies, Penelope J.E. Denny, Walter B. Hofrichter, Frima Fox. Jacobs, Joseph. Roberts, Ann M. Simon, David L. Janson's History of Art, Prentice Hall; 2007, Upper Saddle, New Jersey. Seventh Edition, pg. 298 Turkish Ushak carpet Very early Islamic carpets, i.e. those before the 16th century, are extremely rare. More have survived in the West and oriental carpets in Renaissance painting from Europe are a major source of information on them, as they were valuable imports that were painted accurately.King and Sylvester, throughout, but 9‚Äì28, 49‚Äì50, & 59 in particular The most natural and easy designs for a carpet weaver to produce consist of straight lines and edges, and the earliest Islamic carpets to survive or be shown in paintings have geometric designs, or centre on very stylized animals, made up in this way. Since the flowing loops and curves of the arabesque are central to Islamic art, the interaction and tension between these two styles was long a major feature of carpet design. There are a few survivals of the grand Egyptian 16th century carpets, including one almost as good as new discovered in the attic of the Pitti Palace in Florence, whose complex patterns of octagon roundels and stars, in just a few colours, shimmer before the viewer.King and Sylvester, 27, 61‚Äì62, as \\"The Medici Mamluk Carpet\\" Production of this style of carpet began under the Mamluks but continued after the Ottomans conquered Egypt.King and Sylvester, 59‚Äì66, 79‚Äì83 The other sophisticated tradition was the Persian carpet which reached its peak in the 16th and early 17th century in works like the Ardabil Carpet and Coronation Carpet; during this century the Ottoman and Mughal courts also began to sponsor the making in their domains of large formal carpets, evidently with the involvement of designers used to the latest court style in the general Persian tradition. These use a design style shared with non-figurative Islamic illumination and other media, often with a large central gul motif, and always with wide and strongly demarcated borders. The grand designs of the workshops patronized by the court spread out to smaller carpets for the merely wealthy and for export, and designs close to those of the 16th and 17th centuries are still produced in large numbers today. The description of older carpets has tended to use the names of carpet-making centres as labels, but often derived from the design rather than any actual evidence that they originated from around that centre. Research has clarified that designs were by no means always restricted to the centre they are traditionally associated with, and the origin of many carpets remains unclear. As well as the major Persian, Turkish and Arab centres, carpets were also made across Central Asia, in India, and in Spain and the Balkans. Spanish carpets, which sometimes interrupted typical Islamic patterns to include coats of arms, enjoyed high prestige in Europe, being commissioned by royalty and for the Papal Palace, Avignon, and the industry continued after the Reconquista.King and Sylvester: Spanish carpets: 11‚Äì12, 50‚Äì52; Balkans: 77 and passim Armenian carpet-weaving is mentioned by many early sources, and may account for a much larger proportion of East Turkish and Caucasian production than traditionally thought. The Berber carpets of North Africa have a distinct design tradition. Apart from the products of city workshops, in touch with trading networks that might carry the carpets to markets far away, there was also a large and widespread village and nomadic industry producing work that stayed closer to traditional local designs. As well as pile carpets, kelims and other types of flat-weave or embroidered textiles were produced, for use on both floors and walls. Figurative designs, sometimes with large human figures, are very popular in Islamic countries but relatively rarely exported to the West, where abstract designs are generally what the market expects.  Architecture  Great Mosque of Damascus, 709-715 AD, Syria, constructed by the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I = Columns = Early Islamic columns followed the style seen in the classic period of the Mediterranean. Classic columns can be seen in earlier mosques such as the Great Mosque of Damascus and C√≥rdoba. These columns can vary in form from being completely smooth, and having vertical or twisting fluting. In the 7th and 8th century, the Mosque of the Prophet Medina, was rebuilt using a style known as hypostyle. Hypostyle mosques usually entail multiple columns that support a smooth and even wall. In India, traditionally Indian stone columns of different shapes such a circles, squares and octagons, were incorporated into some mosques. Finally, engaged columns were introduced into decorate Islamic buildings. = Arches = Indian Islamic Arches as seen in the Buland Darvaza in Fatehpur Sikri built in the 16th Century Islamic arches, similar to columns, followed a style similar to Roman architecture. Arches became quite prominent to Islamic architecture during the 8th-10th centuries. There are three distinct shapes of Islamic arches which include horseshoe, keel, and polylobuled. However, in India, Islamic arches take shape after being pointed, lobed, or ogee.  Ceramics  10th-century dish from East Persia Islamic art has very notable achievements in ceramics, both in pottery and tiles for walls, which in the absence of wall-paintings were taken to heights unmatched by other cultures. Early pottery is often unglazed, but tin-opacified glazing was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stonepaste ceramics, originating from 9th century Iraq.Mason (1995), p. 5 The first industrial complex for glass and pottery production was built in Raqqa, Syria, in the 8th century. Other centers for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).Mason (1995), p. 7 Lusterwares with iridescent colours may have continued pre-Islamic Roman and Byzantine techniques, but were either invented or considerably developed on pottery and glass in Persia and Syria from the 9th century onwards.Arts, 206‚Äì207 Islamic pottery was often influenced by Chinese ceramics, whose achievements were greatly admired and emulated.See Rawson throughout; Canby, 120‚Äì123, and see index; Jones & Mitchell, 206‚Äì211 This was especially the case in the periods after the Mongol invasions and those of the Timurids. Techniques, shapes and decorative motifs were all affected. Until the Early Modern period Western ceramics had very little influence, but Islamic pottery was very sought after in Europe, and often copied. An example of this is the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Hispano-Moresque examples were exported to Italy, stimulating the earliest Italian examples, from 15th century Florence. Iznik glazed pottery ca. 1575 The Hispano-Moresque style emerged in Al-Andaluz or Muslim Spain in the 8th century, under Egyptian influence, but most of the best production was much later, by potters presumed to have been largely Muslim but working in areas reconquered by the Christian kingdoms. It mixed Islamic and European elements in its designs, and much was exported across neighbouring European countries. It had introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: glazing with an opaque white tin-glaze, and painting in metallic lusters. Ottoman ƒ∞znik pottery produced most of the best work in the 16th century, in tiles and large vessels boldly decorated with floral motifs influenced, once again, by Chinese Yuan and Ming ceramics. These were still in earthenware; there was no porcelain made in Islamic countries until modern times, though Chinese porcelain was imported and admired.Savage, 175, suggests that the Persians had made some experiments towards producing it, and the earliest European porcelain, Medici porcelain, was made in the late 16th century, perhaps with a Persian or Levantine assistant on the team. The medieval Islamic world also had pottery with painted animal and human imagery. Examples are found throughout the medieval Islamic world, particularly in Persia and Egypt. =Tiling= Tiled exterior of the Friday Mosque of Herat, Afghanistan The earliest grand Islamic buildings, like the Dome of the Rock, in Jerusalem had interior walls decorated with mosaics in the Byzantine style, but without human figures. From the 9th century onwards the distinctive Islamic tradition of glazed and brightly coloured tiling for interior and exterior walls and domes developed. Some earlier schemes create designs using mixtures of tiles each of a single colour that are either cut to shape or are small and of a few shapes, used to create abstract geometric patterns. Later large painted schemes use tiles painted before firing with a part of the scheme ‚Äì a technique requiring confidence in the consistent results of firing. Some elements, especially the letters of inscriptions, may be moulded in three-dimensional relief, and in especially in Persia certain tiles in a design may have figurative painting of animals or single human figures. These were often part of designs mostly made up of tiles in plain colours but with larger fully painted tiles at intervals. The larger tiles are often shaped as eight-pointed stars, and may show animals or a human head or bust, or plant or other motifs. The geometric patterns, such as modern North African zellige work, made of small tiles each of a single colour but different and regular shapes, are often referred to as \\"mosaic\\", which is not strictly correct. The Mughals made much less use of tiling, preferring (and being able to afford) \\"parchin kari\\", a type of pietra dura decoration from inlaid panels of semi- precious stones, with jewels in some cases. This can be seen at the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and other imperial commissions. The motifs are usually floral, in a simpler and more realistic style than Persian or Turkish work, relating to plants in Mughal miniatures.  Glass  \\"The Luck of Edenhall\\", a 13th-century Syrian beaker, in England since the Middle Ages For most of the Middle Ages Islamic glass was the most sophisticated in Eurasia, exported to both Europe and China. Islam took over much of the traditional glass-producing territory of Sassanian and Ancient Roman glass, and since figurative decoration played a small part in pre- Islamic glass, the change in style is not abrupt, except that the whole area initially formed a political whole, and, for example, Persian innovations were now almost immediately taken up in Egypt. For this reason it is often impossible to distinguish between the various centres of production, of which Egypt, Syria and Persia were the most important, except by scientific analysis of the material, which itself has difficulties.Arts, 131, 135. The Introduction (pp. 131‚Äì135) is by Ralph Pinder-Wilson, who shared the catalogue entries with Waffiya Essy. From various documentary references glassmaking and glass trading seems to have been a speciality of the Jewish minority in several centres.Encyclopaedia Judaica, \\"Glass\\", Online version Mamluk mosque lamp Between the 8th and early 11th centuries the emphasis in luxury glass is on effects achieved by \\"manipulating the surface\\" of the glass, initially by incising into the glass on a wheel, and later by cutting away the background to leave a design in relief.Arts, 131‚Äì133 The very massive Hedwig glasses, only found in Europe, but normally considered Islamic (or possibly from Muslim craftsmen in Norman Sicily), are an example of this, though puzzlingly late in date.Arts, 131, 141 These and other glass pieces probably represented cheaper versions of vessels of carved rock crystal (clear quartz), themselves influenced by earlier glass vessels,Arts, 141 and there is some evidence that at this period glass cutting and hardstone carving were regarded as the same craft.Endnote 111 in Roman glass: reflections on cultural change, Fleming, Stuart. see also endnote 110 for Jewish glassworkers From the 12th century the industry in Persia and Mesopotamia appears to decline, and the main production of luxury glass shifts to Egypt and Syria, and decorative effects of colour on smooth surfaced glass.Arts, 131, 133‚Äì135 Throughout the period local centres made simpler wares such as Hebron glass in Palestine. Lustre painting, by techniques similar to lustreware in pottery, dates back to the 8th century in Egypt, and became widespread in the 12th century. Another technique was decoration with threads of glass of a different colour, worked into the main surface, and sometimes manipulated by combing and other effects. Gilded, painted and enamelled glass were added to the repertoire, and shapes and motifs borrowed from other media, such as pottery and metalwork. Some of the finest work was in mosque lamps donated by a ruler or wealthy man. As decoration grew more elaborate, the quality of the basic glass decreased, and it \\"often has a brownish-yellow tinge, and is rarely free from bubbles\\".Arts, 131‚Äì135, 141‚Äì146; quote, 134 Aleppo seems to have ceased to be a major centre after the Mongol invasion of 1260, and Timur appears to have ended the Syrian industry about 1400 by carrying off the skilled workers to Samarkand. By about 1500 the Venetians were receiving large orders for mosque lamps.Arts, 134‚Äì135  Metalwork  Detail of the \\"Baptist√®re de Saint Louis,\\" c. 1300, a Mamluk basin of engraved brass with gold, silver and niello inlay Medieval Islamic metalwork offers a complete contrast to its European equivalent, which is dominated by modelled figures and brightly coloured decoration in enamel, some pieces entirely in precious metals. In contrast surviving Islamic metalwork consists of practical objects mostly in brass, bronze, and steel, with simple, but often monumental, shapes, and surfaces highly decorated with dense decoration in a variety of techniques, but colour mostly restricted to inlays of gold, silver, copper or black niello. The most abundant survivals from medieval periods are fine brass objects, handsome enough to preserve, but not valuable enough to be melted down. The abundant local sources of zinc compared to tin explains the rarity of bronze. Household items, such as ewers or water pitchers, were made of one or more pieces of sheet brass soldered together and subsequently worked and inlaid. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths, as was the wearing of gold rings.Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels One thing Islamic metalworkers shared with European ones was high social status compared to other artists and craftsmen, and many larger pieces are signed. Islamic work includes some three-dimensional animal figures as fountainheads or aquamaniles, but only one significant enamelled object is known, using Byzantine cloisonne techniques.Arts, 201, and earlier pages for animal shapes. The Pisa Griffin is the largest surviving bronze animal, probably from 11th century Al-Andaluz. More common objects given elaborate decoration include massive low candlesticks and lamp-stands, lantern lights, bowls, dishes, basins, buckets (these probably for the bath),But see Arts, 170, where the standard view is disputed and ewers, as well as caskets, pen-cases and plaques. Ewers and basins were brought for hand-washing before and after each meal, so are often lavishly treated display pieces. A typical 13th century ewer from Khorasan is decorated with foliage, animals and the Signs of the Zodiac in silver and copper, and carries a blessing.\\"Base of a ewer with Zodiac medallions [Iran] (91.1.530)\\".

The inscription reads: \\"Bi-l-yumn wa al-baraka‚Ä¶\\" meaning \\"With bliss and divine grace‚Ä¶\\" Specialized objects include knives, arms and armour (always of huge interest to the elite) and scientific instruments such as astrolabes, as well as jewellery. Decoration is typically densely packed and very often includes arabesques and calligraphy, sometimes naming an owner and giving a date.Arts, 157‚Äì160, and exhibits 161‚Äì204  Other applied arts  Mughal dagger with hilt in jade, gold, rubies and emeralds. Blade of damascened steel inlaid with gold. High levels of achievement were reached in other materials, including hardstone carvings and jewellery, ivory carving, textiles and leatherwork. During the Middle Ages, Islamic work in these fields was highly valued in other parts of the world and often traded outside the Islamic zone. Apart from miniature painting and calligraphy, other arts of the book are decorative illumination, the only type found in Qur'an manuscripts, and Islamic book covers, which are often highly decorative in luxury manuscripts, using either the geometric motifs found in illumination, or sometimes figurative images probably drawn for the craftsmen by miniature painters. Materials include coloured, tooled and stamped leather and lacquer over paint.See the relevant sections in \\"Arts\\" = Precious stones = Egyptian carving of rock crystal into vessels appears in the late 10th century, and virtually disappears after about 1040. There are a number of these vessels in the West, which apparently came on the market after the Cairo palace of the Fatimid Caliph was looted by his mercenaries in 1062, and were snapped up by European buyers, mostly ending up in church treasuries.Fatimid Rock Crystal Ewers, Most Valuable Objects in Islamic Art From later periods, especially the hugely wealthy Ottoman and Mughal courts, there are a considerable number of lavish objects carved in semi-precious stones, with little surface decoration, but inset with jewels. Such objects may have been made in earlier periods, but few have survived.Arts, 120‚Äì121 Ottoman marquetry and tile-top table, about 1560 = House and furniture = Older wood carving is typically relief or pierced work on flat objects for architectural use, such as screens, doors, roofs, beams and friezes. An important exception are the complex muqarnas and moc√°rabe designs giving roofs and other architectural elements a stalactite-like appearance. These are often in wood, sometimes painted on the wood but often plastered over before painting; the examples at the Alhambra in Granada, Spain are among the best known. Traditional Islamic furniture, except for chests, tended to be covered with cushions, with cupboards rather than cabinets for storage, but there are some pieces, including a low round (strictly twelve-sided) table of about 1560 from the Ottoman court, with marquetry inlays in light wood, and a single huge ceramic tile or plaque on the tabletop.Table in the Victoria & Albert Museum The fine inlays typical of Ottoman court furniture may have developed from styles and techniques used in weapons and musical instruments, for which the finest craftsmanship available was used.Rogers and Ward, 156 There are also intricately decorated caskets and chests from various periods. A spectacular and famous (and far from flat) roof was one of the Islamic components of the 12th century Norman Cappella Palatina in Palermo, which picked from the finest elements of Catholic, Byzantine and Islamic art. Other famous wooden roofs are in the Alhambra in Granada. Ivory with traces of paint, 11th‚Äì12th century, Egypt = Ivory = Ivory carving centred on the Mediterranean, spreading from Egypt, where a thriving Coptic industry had been inherited; Persian ivory is rare. The normal style was a deep relief with an even surface; some pieces were painted. Spain specialized in caskets and round boxes, which were probably used to keep jewels and perfumes. They were produced mainly in the approximate period 930‚Äì1050, and widely exported. Many pieces are signed and dated, and on court pieces the name of the owner is often inscribed; they were typically gifts from a ruler. As well as a court workshop, Cordoba had commercial workshops producing goods of slightly lower quality. In the 12th and 13th century workshops in Norman Sicily produced caskets, apparently then migrating to Granada and elsewhere after persecution. Egyptian work tended to be in flat panels and friezes, for insertion into woodwork and probably furniture ‚Äì most are now detached from their settings. Many were calligraphic, and others continued Byzantine traditions of hunting scenes, with backgrounds of arabesques and foliage in both cases.Arts, 147‚Äì150, and exhibits following Ilkhanid piece in silk, cotton and gold, Iran or Iraq, early 14th century = Silk = Despite Hadithic sayings against the wearing of silk, the Byzantine and Sassanian traditions of grand figured silk woven cloth continued under Islam. Some designs are calligraphic, especially when made for palls to cover a tomb, but more are surprisingly conservative versions of the earlier traditions, with many large figures of animals, especially majestic symbols of power like the lion and eagle. These are often enclosed in roundels, as found in the pre-Islamic traditions. The majority of early silks have been recovered from tombs, and in Europe reliquaries, where the relics were often wrapped in silk. European clergy and nobility were keen buyers of Islamic silk from an early date and, for example, the body of an early bishop of Toul in France was wrapped in a silk from the Bukhara area in modern Uzbekistan, probably when the body was reburied in 820.Arts, 65‚Äì68; 74, no. 3 The Shroud of St Josse is a famous samite cloth from East Persia, which originally had a carpet-like design with two pairs of confronted elephants, surrounded by borders including rows of camels and an inscription in Kufic script, from which the date appears to be before 961.Louvre, Suaire de St-Josse . Exhibited as no. 4 in Arts, 74. Other silks were used for clothes, hangings, altarcloths, and church vestments, which have nearly all been lost, except for some vestments. Javanese court batik Ottoman silks were less exported, and the many surviving royal kaftans have simpler geometric patterns, many featuring stylized \\"tiger-stripes\\" below three balls or circles. Other silks have foliage designs comparable to those on Iznik pottery or carpets, with bands forming ogival compartments a popular motif. Some designs begin to show Italian influence. By the 16th century Persian silk was using smaller patterns, many of which showed relaxed garden scenes of beautiful boys and girls from the same world as those in contemporary album miniatures, and sometimes identifiable scenes from Persian poetry. A 16th-century circular ceiling for a tent, 97 cm across, shows a continuous and crowded hunting scene; it was apparently looted by the army of Suleiman the Magnificent in his invasion of Persia in 1543‚Äì45, before being taken by a Polish general at the Siege of Vienna in 1683. Mughal silks incorporate many Indian elements, and often feature relatively realistic \\"portraits\\" of plants, as found in other media.Arts, 68, 71, 82‚Äì86, 106‚Äì108, 110‚Äì111, 114‚Äì115 =Indonesian batik= The development and refinement of Indonesian batik cloth was closely linked to Islam. The Islamic prohibition on certain images encouraged batik design to become more abstract and intricate. Realistic depictions of animals and humans are rare on traditional batik. However, mythical serpents, humans with exaggerated features and the Garuda of pre-Islamic mythology are common motifs. Although its existence pre-dates Islam, batik reached its zenith in royal Muslim courts such as Mataram and Yogyakarta, whose sultans encouraged and patronised batik production. Today, batik is undergoing a revival, and cloths are used for additional purposes such as wrapping the Quran.  History = Beginnings = Palace fa√ßade from Mshatta in Jordan, now in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin, c. ?740  Pre-dynastic  The period of a rapid expansion of the Islamic era forms a reasonably accurate beginning for the label of Islamic art. Early geographical boundaries of the Islamic culture were in present-day Syria. It is quite difficult to distinguish the earliest Islamic objects from their predecessors in Persian or Sasanian and Byzantine art, and the conversion of the mass of the population, including artists, took a significant period, sometimes centuries, after the initial spread of Islam. There was, notably, a significant production of unglazed ceramics, witnessed by a famous small bowl preserved in the Louvre, whose inscription assures its attribution to the Islamic period. Plant motifs were the most important in these early productions. Influences from the Sassanian artistic tradition include the image of the king as a warrior and the lion as a symbol of nobility and virility. Bedouin tribal traditions mixed with the more sophisticated styles of the conquered territories. For an initial period coins had human figures in the Byzantine and Sassanian style, perhaps to reassure users of their continued value, before the Islamic style with lettering only took over. Mosaics from the riwaq (portico) of the Umayyad Mosque  Umayyad  Religious and civic architecture were developed under the Umayyad Caliphates (661‚Äì750), when new concepts and new plans were put into practice. The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem is one of the most important buildings in all of Islamic architecture, marked by a strong Byzantine influence (mosaic against a gold background, and a central plan that recalls that of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre), but already bearing purely Islamic elements, such as the great epigraphic frieze. The desert palaces in Jordan and Syria (for example, Mshatta, Qusayr 'Amra, and Hisham's Palace) served the caliphs as living quarters, reception halls, and baths, and were decorated, including some wall-paintings, to promote an image of royal luxury. Work in ceramics was still somewhat primitive and unglazed during this period. Some metal objects have survived from this time, but it remains rather difficult to distinguish these objects from those of the pre-Islamic period. 'Abd al-Malik introduced standard coinage that featured Arabic inscriptions, instead of images of the monarch. The quick development of a localized coinage around the time of the Dome of the Rock's construction demonstrates the reorientation of Umayyad acculturation. This period saw the genesis of a particularly Islamic art. In this period, Umayyad artists and artisans did not invent a new vocabulary, but began to prefer those received from Mediterranean and Iranian late antiquity, which they adapted to their own artistic conceptions. For example, the mosaics in the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus are based on Byzantine models but replace the figurative elements with images of trees and cities. The desert palaces also bear witness to these influences. By combining the various traditions that they had inherited, and by readapting motifs and architectural elements, artists created little by little a typically Muslim art, particularly discernible in the aesthetic of the arabesque, which appears both on monuments and in illuminated Qurans.  Abbasid  Lusterware bowl from Susa, 9th century, today in the Louvre The Abbasid Caliphate (750‚Äì1258Gruber, World of Art) witnessed the movement of the capital from Damascus to Baghdad, and then from Baghdad to Samarra. The shift to Baghdad influenced politics, culture, and art. Art historian Robert Hillenbrand (1999) likens the movement to the foundation of an \\"Islamic Rome\\", because the meeting of Eastern influences from Iranian, Eurasian steppe, Chinese, and Indian sources created a new paradigm for Islamic art. Classical forms inherited from Byzantine Europe and Greco-Roman sources were discarded in favor of those drawn from the new Islamic hub. Even the design of the city of Baghdad placed it in the \\"navel of the world\\", as 9th-century historian al-Ya'qubi wrote.Hillenbrand (1999), p.40 The ancient city of Baghdad cannot be excavated well, as it lies beneath the modern city. However, Abbasid Samarra, which was largely abandoned, has been well studied, and is known for its surviving examples of stucco reliefs, in which the prehistory of the arabesque can be traced. Motifs known from the stucco at Samarra permit the dating of structures built elsewhere, and are furthermore found on portable objects, particular in wood, from Egypt through to Iran. Samarra witnessed the \\"coming of age\\" of Islamic art. Polychrome painted stucco allowed for experimentation in new styles of moulding and carving. The Abbasid period also coincided with two major innovations in the ceramic arts: the invention of faience, and of metallic lusterware. Hadithic prohibition of the use of golden or silver vessels led to the development of metallic lusterware in pottery, which was made by mixing sulphur and metallic oxides to ochre and vinegar, painted onto an already glazed vessel and then fired a second time. It was expensive, and difficult to manage the second round through the kiln, but the wish to exceed fine Chinese porcelain led to the development of this technique.Hillenbrand (1999), p.54 Tiraz Textile Fragment, 946‚Äì974 Brooklyn Museum Though the common perception of Abbasid artistic production focuses largely on pottery, the greatest development of the Abbasid period was in textiles. Government-run workshops known as tiraz produced silks bearing the name of the monarch, allowing for aristocrats to demonstrate their loyalty to the ruler. Other silks were pictorial. The utility of silk-ware in wall decor, entrance adornment, and room separation was not as important as its cash value along the Silk Road. Islamic calligraphy began to be used in surface decoration on pottery during this period. Illuminated qur'ans gained attention, letter-forms now more complex and stylized to the point of slowing down the recognition of the words themselves.Hillenbrand (1999), p.58 =Medieval period (9th‚Äì15th centuries)= Beginning in the ninth century, Abbasid sovereignty was contested in the provinces furthest removed from the Iraqi center. The creation of an Isma ªili Shi ªi dynasty, that of the North African Fatimid Caliphate, followed by the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba in the Iberian Peninsula, gave force to this opposition, as well as small dynasties and autonomous governors in Iran. Spain and the Maghreb Embroidery fly mask Pyxis of al-Mughira, Medina Azahara, Spain, 968 The first Islamic dynasty to establish itself in Iberia, known in Arabic as al-Andalus, was the Umayyads, descended from the great Umayyad Caliphate of Syria. After their fall, they were replaced by various autonomous kingdoms, the taifas (1031‚Äì91), but the artistic production from this period does not differ significantly from that of the Umayyads. At the end of the 11th century, two Berber tribes, the Almoravids and the Almohads, captured the head of the Maghreb and Spain, successively, bringing Maghrebi influences into art. A series of military victories by Christian monarchs had reduced Islamic Spain by the end of the 14th century to the city of Granada, ruled by the Nasrid dynasty, who managed to maintain their hold until 1492. Al-Andalus was a great cultural center of the Middle Ages. Besides the great universities, which taught philosophies and sciences yet unknown in Christendom (such as those of Averroes), the territory was an equally vital center for art. Many techniques were employed in the manufacture of objects. Ivory was used extensively for the manufacture of boxes and caskets. The pyxis of al-Mughira is a masterwork of the genre. In metalwork, large sculptures in the round, normally rather scarce in the Islamic world, served as elaborate receptacles for water or as fountain spouts. A great number of textiles, most notably silks, were exported: many are found in the church treasuries of Christendom, where they served as covering for saints‚Äô reliquaries. From the periods of Maghrebi rule one may also note a taste for painted and sculpted woodwork. The art of north Africa is not as well studied. The Almoravid and Almohad dynasties are characterized by a tendency toward austerity, for example in mosques with bare walls. Nevertheless, luxury arts continued to be produced in great quantity. The Marinid and Hafsid dynasties developed an important, but poorly understood, architecture, and a significant amount of painted and sculpted woodwork. Arab Mashriq The Fatimid Caliphate, which reigned in Egypt from 909 and 1171, introduced crafts and knowledge from politically-troubled Baghdad to their capital of Cairo. By 1070, the Seljuq Empire emerged as the dominant political force in the Muslim world after they liberated Baghdad and defeated the Byzantines at Manzikert. During the rule of Malik-Shah I, the Seljuks excelled in architecture at the same time in Syria, the atabegs (governors of Seljuk princes) assumed power. Quite independent, they capitalized on conflicts with the Frankish crusaders. In 1171, Saladin seized Fatimid Egypt, and installed the transitory Ayyubid dynasty on the throne. This period is notable for innovations in metallurgy and the widespread manufacture of the Damascus steel swords and daggers and the production ceramics, glass and metalwork of a high quality were produced without interruption, and enamelled glass became another important craft. In 1250, Mamluks seized control of Egypt from the Ayyubids as the Mamluk Sultanate, and by 1261 had managed to assert themselves in Syria as well their most famous ruler was Baibars. The Mamluks were not, strictly speaking, a dynasty, as they did not maintain a patrilineal mode of succession; in fact, Mamluks were freed Turkish and Caucasian slaves, who (in theory) passed the power to others of like station. This mode of government persevered for three centuries, until 1517, and gave rise to abundant architectural projects; many thousands of buildings were constructed during this period. Patronage of luxury arts favored primarily enamelled glass and metalwork and is remembered as the golden age of medieval Egypt. The Baptist√®re de Saint Louis in the Louvre is an example of the very high quality of metalwork at this period. Iran and Central Asia Bibi-Khanym Mosque, Samarkand, Uzbekistan, built by Timur in 1399 Iran and the north of India, the Tahirids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, and Ghurids struggled for power in the 10th century, and art was a vital element of this competition. Great cities were built, such as Nishapur and Ghazni, and the construction of the Great Mosque of Isfahan (which would continue, in fits and starts, over several centuries) was initiated. Funerary architecture was also cultivated, while potters developed quite individual styles: kaleidoscopic ornament on a yellow ground; or marbled decorations created by allowing colored glazes to run; or painting with multiple layers of slip under the glaze. The Seljuqs, nomads of Turkic origin from present-day Mongolia, appeared on the stage of Islamic history toward the end of the 10th century. They seized Baghdad in 1048, before dying out in 1194 in Iran, although the production of \\"Seljuq\\" works continued through the end of the 12th and beginning of the 13th century under the auspices of smaller, independent sovereigns and patrons. During their time, the center of culture, politics and art production shifted from Damascus and Baghdad to Merv, Nishapur, Rayy, and Isfahan, all in Iran.Hillenbrand (1999), p.89 Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran Popular patronage expanded because of a growing economy and new urban wealth. Inscriptions in architecture tended to focus more on the patrons of the piece. For example, sultans, viziers or lower ranking officials would receive often mention in inscriptions on mosques. Meanwhile, growth in mass market production and sale of art made it more commonplace and accessible to merchants and professionals.Hillenbrand (1999), p.91 Because of increased production, many relics have survived from the Seljuk era and can be easily dated. In contrast, the dating of earlier works is more ambiguous. It is, therefore, easy to mistake Seljuk art as new developments rather than inheritance from classical Iranian and Turkic sources.Hillenbrand (1999), Chapter 4 Innovations in ceramics from this period include the production of minai ware and the manufacture of vessels, not out of clay, but out of a silicon paste (\\"fritware\\"), while metalworkers began to encrust bronze with precious metals. Across the Seljuk era, from Iran to Iraq, a unification of book painting can be seen. These paintings have animalistic figures that convey strong symbolic meaning of fidelity, treachery, and courage.Hillenbrand, p.100 During the 13th century, the Mongols under the leadership of Genghis Khan swept through the Islamic world. After his death, his empire was divided among his sons, forming many dynasties: the Yuan in China, the Ilkhanids in Iran and the Golden Horde in northern Iran and southern Russia. =Ilkhanids= A rich civilization developed under these \\"little khans\\", who were originally subservient to the Yuan emperor, but rapidly became independent. Architectural activity intensified as the Mongols became sedentary, and retained traces of their nomadic origins, such as the north‚Äìsouth orientation of the buildings. At the same time a process of \\"iranisation\\" took place, and construction according to previously established types, such as the \\"Iranian plan\\" mosques, was resumed. The art of the Persian book was also born under this dynasty, and was encouraged by aristocratic patronage of large manuscripts such as the Jami' al-tawarikh by Rashid-al-Din Hamadani. New techniques in ceramics appeared, such as the lajvardina (a variation on luster-ware), and Chinese influence is perceptible in all arts. =The Golden Horde and the Timurids= The early arts of the nomads of the Golden Horde are poorly understood. Research is only beginning, and evidence for town planning and architecture has been discovered. There was also a significant production of works in gold, which often show a strong Chinese influence. Much of this work is preserved today in the Hermitage. The beginning of the third great period of medieval Iranian art, that of the Timurids, was marked by the invasion of a third group of nomads, under the direction of Timur. During the 15th century this dynasty gave rise to a golden age in Persian manuscript painting, including renowned painters such as KamƒÅl ud-Dƒ´n BehzƒÅd, but also a multitude of workshops and patrons. Syria, Iraq, Anatolia √áifte Minareli Medrese in Erzurum. Before 1265 The Seljuq Turks pushed beyond Iran into Anatolia, winning a victory over the Byzantine Empire in the Battle of Manzikert (1071), and setting up a sultanate independent of the Iranian branch of the dynasty. Their power seems largely to have waned following the Mongol invasions in 1243, but coins were struck under their name until 1304. Architecture and objects synthesized various styles, both Iranian and Syrian, sometimes rendering precise attributions difficult. The art of woodworking was cultivated, and at least one illustrated manuscript dates to this period. Caravanserais dotted the major trade routes across the region, placed at intervals of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai inns improved in scale, fortification, and replicability. Also, they began to contain central mosques. The Turkmen were nomads who settled in the area of Lake Van. They were responsible for a number of mosques, such as the Blue Mosque in Tabriz, and they had a decisive influence after the fall of the Anatolian Seljuqs. Starting in the 13th century, Anatolia was dominated by small Turkmen dynasties, which progressively chipped away at Byzantine territory. Little by little a major dynasty emerged, that of the Ottomans, who, after 1450, are referred to as the \\"first Ottomans\\". Turkmen artworks can be seen as the forerunners of Ottoman art, in particular the \\"Milet\\" ceramics and the first blue-and-white Anatolian works. Islamic book painting witnessed its first golden age in the thirteenth century, mostly from Syria and Iraq. Influence from Byzantine visual vocabulary (blue and gold coloring, angelic and victorious motifs, symbology of drapery) combined with Mongoloid facial types in 12th-century book frontispieces. Earlier coinage necessarily featured Arabic epigraphs, but as Ayyubid society became more cosmopolitan and multi- ethnic, coinage began to feature astrological, figural (featuring a variety of Greek, Seleucid, Byzantine, Sasanian, and contemporary Turkish rulers' busts), and animal images. Hillenbrand suggests that the medieval Islamic texts called Maqamat, copied and illustrated by Yahya ibn Mahmud al-Wasiti were some of the earliest \\"coffee table books\\". They were among the first texts to hold up a mirror to daily life in Islamic art, portraying humorous stories and showing little to no inheritance of pictorial tradition.Hillenbrand, p.128-131 Indian subcontinent Mughal Arabesque inlays at the Agra Fort, India. The Indian subcontinent, some northern parts of which conquered by the Ghaznavids and Ghurids in the 9th century, did not become autonomous until 1206, when the Muizzi, or slave-kings, seized power, marking the birth of the Delhi Sultanate. Later other competing sultanates were founded in Bengal, Kashmir, Gujarat, Jaunpur, Malwa, and in the north Deccan (the Bahmanids). They separated themselves little by little from Persian traditions, giving birth to an original approach to architecture and urbanism, marked in particular by interaction with Hindu art. Study of the production of objects has hardly begun, but a lively art of manuscript illumination is known. The period of the sultanates ended with the arrival of the Mughals, who progressively seized their territories. = The Three Empires = 16th century ƒ∞znik pottery  Ottomans  The Ottoman Empire, whose origins lie in the 14th century, continued in existence until shortly after World War I. This impressive longevity, combined with an immense territory (stretching from Anatolia to Tunisia), led naturally to a vital and distinctive art, including plentiful architecture, mass production of ceramics for both tiles and vessels, most notably Iznik ware, important metalwork and jewellery, Turkish paper marbling Ebru, Turkish carpets as well as tapestries and exceptional Ottoman miniatures and decorative Ottoman illumination. Masterpieces of Ottoman manuscript illustration include the two \\"books of festivals\\" (Surname-I H√ºmayun), one dating from the end of the 16th century, and the other from the era of Sultan Murad III. These books contain numerous illustrations and exhibit a strong Safavid influence; thus they may have been inspired by books captured in the course of the Ottoman-Safavid wars of the 16th century. The Ottomans are also known for their development of a bright red pigment, \\"Iznik red\\", in ceramics, which reached their height in the 16th century, both in tile-work and pottery, using floral motifs that were considerably transformed from their Chinese and Persian models. From the 18th century, Ottoman art came under considerable European influence, the Turks adopting versions of Rococo which had a lasting and not very beneficial effect, leading to over-fussy decoration.Levey, chapters 5 and 6 European- style painting was slow to be adopted, with Osman Hamdi Bey (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent Orientalism from the inside, as it were. An illustrated manuscript of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan attending the marriage procession of his eldest son Dara Shikoh. Mughal-Era fireworks brightened the night throughout the wedding ceremony.  Mughals  The Mughal Empire in the Indian subcontinent lasted from 1526 until (technically) 1858, although from the late 17th century power flowed away from the emperors to local rulers, and later European powers, above all the British Raj, who were the main power in India by the late 18th century. The period is most notable for luxury arts of the court, and Mughal styles heavily influenced local Hindu and later Sikh rulers as well. The Mughal miniature began by importing Persian artists, especially a group brought back by Humayun when in exile in Safavid Persia, but soon local artists, many Hindu, were trained in the style. Realistic portraiture, and images of animals and plants, was developed in Mughal art beyond what the Persians had so far achieved, and the size of miniatures increased, sometimes onto canvas. The Mughal court had access to European prints and other art, and these had increasing influence, shown in the gradual introduction of aspects of Western graphical perspective, and a wider range of poses in the human figure. Some Western images were directly copied or borrowed from. As the courts of local Nawabs developed, distinct provincial styles with stronger influence from traditional Indian painting developed in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts. The arts of jewelry and hardstone carving of gemstones, such as jasper, jade, adorned with rubies, diamonds and emeralds are mentioned by the Mughal chronicler Abu'l Fazl, and a range of examples survive; the series of hard stone daggers in the form of horses‚Äô heads is particularly impressive. The Mughals were also fine metallurgists they introduced Damascus steel and refined the locally produced Wootz steel, the Mughals also introduced the \\"bidri\\" technique of metalwork in which silver motifs are pressed against a black background. Famous Mughal metallurgists like Ali Kashmiri and Muhammed Salih Thatawi created the seamless celestial globes. Entrance to Sheykh Lotfollah mosque, Naqsh-e Jahan Square, Isfahan  Safavids and Qajars  The Iranian Safavids, a dynasty stretching from 1501 to 1786, is distinguished from the Mughal and Ottoman Empires, and earlier Persian rulers, in part through the Shi'a faith of its shahs, which they succeeded in making the majority denomination in Persia. Ceramic arts are marked by the strong influence of Chinese porcelain, often executed in blue and white. Architecture flourished, attaining a high point with the building program of Shah Abbas in Isfahan, which included numerous gardens, palaces (such as Ali Qapu), an immense bazaar, and a large imperial mosque. Bou Inania Madrasa, Fes, Morocco, zellige mosaic tiles forming elaborate geometric tessellations The art of manuscript illumination also achieved new heights, in particular in the Shah Tahmasp Shahnameh, an immense copy of Ferdowsi's poem containing more than 250 paintings. In the 17th century a new type of painting develops, based around the album (muraqqa). The albums were the creations of connoisseurs who bound together single sheets containing paintings, drawings, or calligraphy by various artists, sometimes excised from earlier books, and other times created as independent works. The paintings of Reza Abbasi figure largely in this new art of the book, depicting one or two larger figures, typically idealized beauties in a garden setting, often using the grisaille techniques previously used for border paintings for the background. After the fall of the Safavids, the Qajars, a Turkmen tribe established from centuries on the banks of the Caspian Sea, assumed power. Qajar art displays an increasing European influence, as in the large oil paintings portraying the Qajar shahs. Steelwork also assumed a new importance. Like the Ottomans, the Qajar dynasty survived until 1925, a few years after the First World War. = Modern period = From the 15th century, the number of smaller Islamic courts began to fall, as the Ottoman Empire, and later the Safavids and European powers, swallowed them up; this had an effect on Islamic art, which was usually strongly led by the patronage of the court. From at least the 18th century onwards, elite Islamic art was increasingly influenced by European styles, and in the applied arts either largely adopted Western styles, or ceased to develop, retaining whatever style was prevalent at some point in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. Many industries with very long histories, such as pottery in Iran, largely closed, while others, like metalwork in brass, became generally frozen in style, with much of their production going to tourists or exported as oriental exotica. The carpet industry has remained large, but mostly uses designs that originated before 1700, and competes with machine-made imitations both locally and around the world. Arts and crafts with a broader social base, like the zellige mosaic tiles of the Maghreb, have often survived better. Islamic countries have developed modern and contemporary art, with very vigorous art worlds in some countries, but the degree to which these should be grouped in a special category as \\"Islamic art\\" is questionable, although many artists deal with Islam-related themes, and use traditional elements such as calligraphy. Especially in the oil-rich parts of the Islamic world much modern architecture and interior decoration makes use of motifs and elements drawn from the heritage of Islamic art.

Mayo Williams Note: According to research presented by Jim Dawson and Steve Propes (What Was the First Rock 'N' Roll Record, (1992). Boston: Faber and Faber, p. 49. ), Williams did not co-author the song, but merely purchased half the rights to it for $10, in 1947. Early life McGhee was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, and grew up in Kingsport, Tennessee. He received his nickname when he was a child. He used a stick to push a wagon carrying his older brother Brownie McGhee, who had contracted polio.Toshes, Nick (1999). Unsung Heroes of Rock 'n' Roll: The Birth of Rock in the Wild Years before Elvis. New York: Da Capo Press. Granville began playing the guitar when he was thirteen years old. After his freshman year he dropped out of high school and worked with his father at the Eastman Kodak subsidiary, Tennessee Eastman Company in Kingsport. In 1940, Granville quit his job and moved to Portsmouth, Virginia, and then to New York City. He entered the military in 1942 and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. After being discharged in 1946, he settled in New York. Entertainment career In the military, McGhee often played his guitar. One of the songs he performed was \\"Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\". The original lyrics of the song were as follows: > Drinkin‚Äô that mess is our delight, > And when we get drunk, start fightin‚Äô all night. > Knockin‚Äô out windows and tearin‚Äô down doors, > Drinkin‚Äô half-gallons and callin‚Äô for more. > Drinkin‚Äô wine motherfucker, drinkin‚Äô wine! > Goddam! > Drinkin‚Äô wine motherfucker, drinkin‚Äô wine! > Goddam! > Drinkin‚Äô wine motherfucker, drinkin‚Äô wine! > Goddam! > Pass that bottle to me!\\" It was one of the earliest prototypical rock-and-roll songs. Cover versions were recorded by Wynonie Harris, Lionel Hampton, Big John Greer, Johnny Burnette, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Mike Bloomfield's Electric Flag (as \\"Wine\\"). The song lent its name to the alcoholic fruit drink spodi. In 1946 Granville and Brownie McGhee wrote a version of the song that didn't use profanity. Harlem Records released the new version in January 1947. It sold for 49 cents. It did not get much airplay until two years later, when Stick re-created the song for Atlantic Records. It was on the Billboard R&B; chart for almost half a year, rising to number 2, where it stayed for four weeks. Numerous cover versions of his songs were recorded over the years. The first cover was by Lionel Hampton, featuring Sonny Parker; next was a cover by Wynonie Harris, followed by a hillbilly-bop version by Loy Gordon & His Pleasant Valley Boys. \\"Drinkin' Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\" continued to be popular throughout the 1950s in cover versions by various artists, including Malcolm Yelvington in 1954, Johnny Burnette in 1957, and Jerry Lee Lewis in 1959. McGhee continued to make records for Atlantic and created popular songs such as \\"Tennessee Waltz Blues\\", \\"Drank Up All the Wine Last Night\\", \\"Venus Blues\\", \\"Let's Do It\\", and \\"One Monkey Don't Stop No Show\\", but his music career overall was not successful. McGhee moved from Atlantic to Essex Records, for which he recorded \\"My Little Rose\\". The record was not commercially successful, so he moved to King Records in 1953. There he recorded a number of rock-and-roll songs, such a \\"Whiskey, Women and Loaded Dice\\", \\"Head Happy with Wine\\", \\"Jungle Juice\\", \\"Six to Eight\\", \\"Double Crossin' Liquor\\", \\"Dealin' from the Bottom\\", and \\"Get Your Mind Out of the Gutter\\". However, he was unable to make money from his records, so he left King for Savoy Records in 1955. He retired from the music industry in 1960. In the late '50s McGhee recorded LP album tracks with Sonny Terry for the Folkways and Prestige-Bluesville labels. In 1960 he cut the songs \\"Sleep in Job\\" and \\"Money Fever\\" in New York with Sonny Terry. The tracks were released on Herald Records. This was McGhee's last recording session. He became ill shortly afterward and died in August 1961. Death McGhee died of lung cancer in The Bronx, New York, on August 15, 1961, at the age of forty-three. He left his old guitar to Brownie's son before he died.

Born in Camnish, near Dungiven, County Londonderry and reared in Newry, he became a leading member of both Young Ireland and the Irish Confederation. He was transported to Van Diemen's Land but later escaped to the United States in the 1850s, he became a pro- slavery editorial voice. Mitchel supported the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War, and two of his sons died fighting for the Confederate cause. He was elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1875, but was disqualified because he was a convicted felon. His Jail JournalJail Journal was first serialised in his first New York City newspaper, The Citizen, from 14 January 1854 to 19 August 1854 is one of Irish nationalism's most famous texts. Family John Mitchel's father, also John, was educated mainly at the University of Glasgow and became a Presbyterian clergyman.William Dillon, The life of John Mitchel (London, 1888) 2 Vols. Ch I-II William Dillon, Mitchel's biographer tells that \\"about the year 1810, he was put in charge of the church at or near Dungiven, in the county of Derry\\". It was here that he met and married Mary Haslett. In 1819, the Rev. Mitchel was called to Derry, where he remained for some four years, when he received the \\"call\\" from both Newry and Armagh. He accepted the call to Newry, and remained there, respected by all classes, until his death in 1840. After her husband's death Mrs Mitchel travelled a good deal. In 1853, when her son escaped from his exile in Van Diemen's Land and went to the United States, she, with her other son and two of her daughters, went there to receive him. She lived in the US for several years then recrossed the Atlantic, and went to live in London. From there she went to Newry, where she remained until her death in 1865. Early life At the age of four, John Mitchel was sent to a classical school, run by an old minister named Moor, nicknamed \\"Gospel Moor\\" by the students. He read books from a very early age. When a little over five years old, he was introduced to Latin grammar by his teacher and made quick progress. John Martin When he was seven, the family had moved to Newry, where he attended a school run by Mr McNeil. Mitchel did not get on with McNeil, who considered the topics that Mitchel was reading (Caesar) too advanced for him. Mitchel was discouraged by this and began to pay less attention in class, where McNeil pronounced him stupid. He was taken out of the school, and sent to a classical school, kept by a Dr Henderson. The encouragement and support of Dr Henderson laid the foundations of his classical scholarship which was to play such a major part in his later life. Mitchel also met at the school his lifelong friend, John Martin, who was to experience and share in much of his later career. In 1830 Mitchel, then not yet 15 years old, entered Trinity College, Dublin, with the encouragement of Dr Henderson. He took his degree in 1834, at the age of 19. He decided against becoming a minister and went to work first as a bank clerk in Derry, where Mrs Mitchel's brother, William Haslett, was director of a bank, and then in late 1835 or early 1836, he entered the office of a Newry solicitor, John Quinn, who was a friend of his father. Marriage and family In the spring of 1836 he met Jane Verner, the only daughter of Captain James Verner. Though both families were opposed to the relationship, they became engaged in the autumn and were married on 3 February 1837, by the Rev. David Babington, in the parish church of Drumcree. Their first child, John, was born on 24 January 1838. Their second, James, born in February 1840, was to be the father of the New York Mayor John Purroy Mitchel. At this time Mitchel was a member of a literary society, and contributed essays from time to time. He also contributed a series of letters to The Times newspaper on Canadian politics, which were published. Around this time, a project was started to hold a public dinner for Daniel O'Connell, the leader of the Repeal Association. Mitchel took an active part in the preparations, and though violence was anticipated, Newry then being a stronghold of the Orange Order, the dinner went off peacefully.William Dillon, The Life of John Mitchel (London, 1888) 2 Vols. Ch III Around 1839, Mitchel suffered his first attack of asthma, which was to trouble him for the rest of his life. In 1840 Mitchel completed his apprenticeship, and was sworn in as an attorney. He then formed a partnership with a Mr Fraser, a successful attorney in Newry. They decided to expand the practice, and established an office in Banbridge, which Mitchel took charge of. Mitchel and his family spent the next five years in Banbridge, where two more children were born, Henrietta in October 1842, and William in May 1844. Early politics Thomas Davis According to his biographer William Dillon, Banbridge at this time was in an Orange constituency, and the Orangemen liked to \\"walk\\" to their assemblies, to commemorate important historical anniversaries. On their return homeward in the evenings some of them would pass through Catholic neighbourhoods, and \\"stop at the doors of Catholic homes to play party tunes\\". This would lead to confrontation, and would often end in the wrecking of houses, beatings or even killings, on both sides. John Mitchel was often employed by the Catholics in the legal proceedings arising out of these affrays. Dillon suggests that it was having seen how these cases were dealt with by magistrates, many of whom were Orangemen themselves, that instilled in him a \\"hatred of injustice\\", at a time when he was taking a keen interest in politics. Until his marriage, John Mitchel had by and large taken his politics from his father, who according to Dillon had \\"begun to comprehend the degradation of his countrymen\\". Soon after the granting of Catholic emancipation in 1829, it was decided by the \\"popular party\\" to run a Catholic candidate for Newry, then regarded as a stronghold of the ascendancy party, which resented \\"so insolent a proceeding on the part of the Catholics\\". Many members of the Rev. Mitchel's congregation took an active part in the elections on the side of the ascendancy, and pushed for the Rev. Mitchel to do same, which he resolutely refused to do. Because of this he was nicknamed \\"Papist Mitchel.\\" Further evidence of John's political development is found in a letter of October 1842, to his friend John Martin, responding to Martin's sending him a copy of The Nation: \\"I think The Nation will do very well\\"; and again in October, on the arrival of 20,000 additional troops in Ireland: \\"How do you think the country will take all this?\\" he asks, \\"I think I know how it ought to take it; but if I put it on paper, you might inform the Attorney- General, and get me arrested.\\" On Mitchel's frequent trips to Dublin, he came in contact with the Repeal members who gathered about the office of The Nation (later to be known as Young Ireland) and in the spring of 1843, Mitchel joined the Repeal Association and began to contribute to The Nation.William Dillon, The Life of John Mitchel (London, 1888) 2 Vols. Ch IV He publicised a pamphlet by his uncle, Mr Haslet, Mayor of Derry, on the estates of the London Societies in Ulster, wrote a leading article entitled \\"Convicted Criminals\\" (which compared the trial and conviction of Daniel O'Connell with the trial and crucifixion of Jesus Christ), and contributed half of an article on \\"Anti- Irish Catholics\\", the first part of which was written by Thomas Davis.Young Ireland, T.F. O'Sullivan, The Kerryman Ltd, 1945. It was with Davis's encouragement that Mitchel wrote his first book, Life of Hugh O'Neill, which Davis never got to see published: Davis died on 16 September 1845, of scarlet fever. Following the publication of Hugh O'Neill, Charles Gavan Duffy proposed that Mitchel join the staff of The Nation. The Nation Charles Gavan Duffy Mitchel accepted Duffy's invitation to join the staff of The Nation, in the autumn of 1845. He discarded his profession, and brought his wife and children to live in Dublin, first, for a short time at, George's Place; then at 1 Heathfield, Upper Leeson Street, and finally at 8 Ontario Terrace, Rathmines, where he was arrested in 1848. For the next two years Mitchel wrote both political and historical articles and reviews for The Nation. He covered a wide range of subjects, including the Famine, on which he contributed some influential articles which attracted significant attention. On 25 October 1845 he wrote on \\"The People's Food\\", pointing to the failure of the potato crop, and warning landlords that pursuing their tenants for rents would force them to sell their other crops and starve.The Nation newspaper, 1845 He reviewed Curran's Speeches, Carlyle's Life of Cromwell, a pamphlet by Isaac Butt on The Protection of Home Industry, The Age of Pitt and Fox, and later on The Poets and Dramatists of Ireland, edited by Denis Florence MacCarthy (4 April 1846); The Industrial History of Free Nations, by Torrens McCullagh, and Father Meehan's The Confederation of Kilkenny (8 August 1846). But it was Mitchel's political writings in The Nation that would show how strongly he felt with regard to English rule in Ireland. On 1 November 1845 his article was on \\"Foreign Relations\\", and was titled, \\"England's Difficulty is Ireland's Opportunity\\". In this edition also he raised the issue on \\"Potato Disease\\", he pointed out how powerful an agent hunger had been in certain revolutions.The Nation newspaper, 1844 On 8 November, in an article titled \\"The Detectives\\", he wrote, \\"The people are beginning to fear that the Irish Government is merely a machinery for their destruction; that, for all the usual functions of Government, this Castle- nuisance is altogether powerless; that it is unable, or unwilling, to take a single step for the prevention of famine, for the encouragement of manufactures, or providing fields of industry, and is only active in promoting, by high premiums and bounties, the horrible manufacture of crimes!\\" He followed this up on 22 November, with an article titled \\"Threats of Coercion\\", in which he advocated attacks on railways if they were used against the people by the Government, in response to an article in the London journal The Standard, which outlined how the railroads could be used for troops in Ireland. This led to a failed prosecution of the paper in the following year, Mitchel acting as solicitor for the editor, Gavan Duffy. On 6 December 1845, Mitchel's article \\"Oregon‚ÄîIreland\\" referred to the dispute then pending between England and America about Oregon. He wrote, \\"If there is to be a war between England and the United States, tis impossible for us to pretend sympathy with the former. We shall have allies, not enemies, on the banks of the Columbia, and distant and desolate as are those tracts beyond the Rocky Mountains, even there may arise an opportunity for demanding and regaining our place among the nations.\\" On 20 December Mitchel made an appeal to the Protestants of Ireland to join their fellow countrymen. In the article \\"The Protestant Interest\\" he pointed to the efforts of the Whig leaders to win support in Ireland by the promise of gratuity and places. \\"But, Protestants of Ireland, shall it be so? Is it not time for all to rise above such vile influences as these? Does not our national interest, our national honour (for, after all, we are a nation), demand that we spurn the mean practice of both these foreign factions! that we shuffle off the coil of filthy place-hunting politics, that has kept us so long grovelling in the dust!... Ah! if you would hearken to us ‚Äì and a hope dawns upon us that you will ‚Äì if the Protestant magnates of the land would even now place themselves at the head of our national Confederacy, and, in this inter-regnum of foreign rule, would meet us as brothers.\\" In his article \\"The Administration of Justice\\", on 7 February 1846, Mitchel pointed out that the Englishman made his own laws, that they were not imported, that \\"no stranger\\", or \\"slave of a stranger, sat upon his judgment seats\\", that English men had grown \\"to love and honour their native land, and expected no premium upon its betrayal.\\"The Nation newspaper, 1846 He wrote again on the Famine on 14 February, condemning the inadequate response, and asked whether the Government had even yet any conception that there might be soon \\"millions of human beings in Ireland having nothing to eat\\". On 28 February, he observed on the Coercion Bill which was then going through the House of Lords, \\"This is the only kind of legislation for Ireland that is sure to meet with no obstruction in that House. However they may differ about feeding the Irish people, they agree most cordially in the policy of taxing, prosecuting and ruining them.\\" William Smith O'Brien In an article on \\"English Rule\\" on 7 March, he wrote: \\"The Irish People are expecting famine day by day... and they ascribe it unanimously, not so much to the rule of heaven as to the greedy and cruel policy of England. Be that right or wrong, that is their feeling. They believe that the season as they roll are but ministers of England's rapacity; that their starving children cannot sit down to their scanty meal but they see the harpy claw of England in their dish. They behold their own wretched food melting in rottenness off the face of the earth, and they see heavy-laden ships, freighted with the yellow corn their own hands have sown and reaped, spreading all sail for England; they see it and with every grain of that corn goes a heavy curse. Again the people believe‚Äîno matter whether truly or falsely‚Äîthat if they should escape the hunger and the fever their lives are not safe from judges and juries. They do not look upon the law of the land as a terror to evil-doers, and a praise to those who do well; they scowl on it as an engine of foreign rule, ill-omened harbinger of doom.\\" Thomas Carlyle Mitchel made the acquaintance of Thomas Carlyle during his connection with The Nation. Carlyle described a dinner at Mitchel's house in 1846, saying that Mitchel was \\"a fine elastic-spirited young fellow, whom I grieved to see rushing to destruction palpable by attack of windmills, but upon whom all my persuasions were thrown away\\". Carlyle later said, when Mitchel was on trial, \\"Irish Mitchel, poor fellow‚Ä¶ I told him he would most likely be hanged, but I told him, too, that they could not hang the immortal part of him.\\" In 1847 Mitchel resigned his position as leader writer on The Nation. He later explained that he had come to regard as \\"absolutely necessary a more vigorous policy against the English Government than that which William Smith O'Brien, Charles Gavan Duffy and other Young Ireland leaders were willing to pursue\\". He \\"had watched the progress of the famine policy of the Government, and could see nothing in it but a machinery, deliberately devised, and skillfully worked, for the entire subjugation of the island‚Äîthe slaughter of portion of the people, and the pauperization of the rest,\\" and he had therefore \\"come to the conclusion that the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point, and the means for this would be extremely simple, namely, a combination among the people to obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of Irish provisions; to refuse all aid to its removal; to destroy the highways; to prevent everyone, by intimidation, from daring to bid for grain and cattle if brought to auction under 'distress' (a method of obstruction which put an end to Church tithes before); in short, to offer a passive resistance universally; but occasionally, when opportunity served, to try the steel.\\" This revolutionary line conflicted with the stance of The Nation, so Mitchel started his own paper, The United Irishman. The United Irishman The first number of The United Irishman appeared on 12 February 1848. In the Prospectus it was announced that the paper would be edited by John Mitchel, \\"aided by Thomas Devin Reilly, John Martin of Loughorne and other competent contributors.\\" it was said that the projectors of the journal \\"believed that the world was weary of old Ireland and also of Young Ireland‚Äîthat the day for both these noisy factions is past and gone‚Äîthat Old and Young alike have grown superannuated and obsolete together. They believe that Ireland really and truly wants to be freed from English dominion.\\" Mitchel took as the motto for the paper the words of Wolf Tone, \\"Our independence must be had at all hazards. If the men of property will not support us, they must fall; we can support ourselves by the aid of that numerous and respectable class of the community, the men of no property.\\" The Prospectus finished: \\"To enforce and apply these principles ‚Äî to make Irishmen thoroughly understand them, lay them up to their hearts, and practise them in their lives‚Äîwill be the sole and constant study of the United Irishman.\\" Thomas Devin Reilly, Mitchel's collaborator on The United Irishman Mitchel through his paper called for resistance against British rule in Ireland, through the non-payment of rents, and preventing the export of food from the country and became the most vocal in highlighting how the British, in his opinion, deliberately exasperated and mismanaged the Great Famine to reduce the population (which the British Government considered to have a surplus) to more manageable levels.William Dillon, The Life of John Mitchel (London, 1888) 2 Vols p177. The doctrine which The United Irishman was to follow was stated as follows: \\"that the Irish people had a distinct and indefeasible right to their country, and to all the moral and material wealth and resources thereof, to possess, to govern the same, for their own use, maintenance, comfort and honour, as a distinct Sovereign State; that it was within their power and their manifest duty to make good and exercise that right; that the life of one peasant was as precious as the life of one nobleman or gentleman; that the property of the farmers and labourers of Ireland was as sacred as the property of all the noblemen and gentlemen in Ireland, and also immeasurably more valuable; that the Tenant Right custom should be extended to all Ulster, and adopted and enforced by common consent in the other three provinces; that every man who paid taxes should have an equal voice with every other man in the government of the State and the outlay of those taxes; that no man at present had any 'legal' rights or claim to the protection of any law and that all 'legal' and constitutional agitation in Ireland was a delusion; that every freeman, and every man who desired to become free, ought to have arms, and to practise the use of them; that no 'combination of classes' in Ireland was desirable, just, or possible save on the terms of the rights of the industrious classes being acknowledged and secured; and that no good thing could come from the English Parliament or the English Government.\\" In the first editorial, addressed to \\"The Right Hon. the Earl of Clarendon, Englishman, calling himself Her Majesty's Lord Lieutenant ‚Äì General and General Governor of Ireland,\\" Mitchel stated that the purpose of the journal was to resume the struggle which had been waged by Tone and Emmet, the Holy War to sweep this Island clear of the English name and nation.\\" Lord Clarendon was also addressed as \\"Her Majesty's Executioner-General and General Butcher of Ireland\\".The United Irishman, 1848 (For the full text of the letter see here.) The paper had a big circulation and began to exercise a great influence on the masses of the people. In Mitchel's Letters to \\"The Protestant Farmers, Labourers and Artisans of the North of Ireland\\", Mitchel maintained that England did not care about any religion and plundered Protestants as well as Catholics. \\"The Pope,\\" he wrote, \\"we know is the 'Man of Sin', and the 'Antichrist', and also, if you like, the 'Mystery of Iniquity', and all that; but he brings no ejectments in Ireland. The Seven Sacraments are, to be sure, very dangerous, but the quarter-acre clause touches you more nearly. In short, our vicious system of Government, and especially the infamous land laws, are the machinery that brought you to this pass.\\" Commenting on this first edition of The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, maintained that the paper pursued \\"the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, and for this reason I have called the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper‚Äîit is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being to do everything possible to drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. I hope, my Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory‚Äîthat it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect. \\"But this language is addressed, not to the sober-minded and calm-thinking people of England, but to a people, hasty, excitable, enthusiastic and easily stimulated, smarting under great manifold distresses, and who have been for years excited to the utmost pitch to which they could go consistently with their own safety, by the harangues of democrats and revolutionists. \\"This paper was published at five pence, but, as I am informed, when the first number appeared, so much was it sought after, that, on its first appearance, it was eagerly bought in the streets of Dublin at one shilling and sixpence and two shillings a number. With the people of Ireland, my lords, this language will tell; and I say it is not safe for you to disregard it. These men are honest; they are not the kind of men who make their patriotism the means of barter for place or pension. They are not to be bought off by the Government of the day for a colonial place, or by a snug situation in the customs or excise. No; they honestly repudiate this course; they are rebels at heart, and they are rebels avowed, who are in earnest in what they say and propose to do. \\"My Lords, this is not a fit subject, at all events, for contempt. My belief is, that these men are dangerous‚Äîmy belief is, that they are traitors in intent already, and if occasion offers, they will be traitors in fact. You may prosecute them‚Äîyou may convict them; but depend upon it, my Lords, it is neither just to them, nor safe for yourselves, to allow such language to be indulged in. I believe, because I have this strong persuasion of the earnestness and honesty of these men, that it is my duty to call your Lordships' attention to the first number of this paper, called The United Irishman, which is intended to produce an excitement leading to rebellion, for the purpose of showing you the language held forth, and the object avowed by these men, to whom a large portion of the people of Ireland look up with confidence, and for the purpose of asking her Majesty's Government if this paper has come under their consideration, and if so, whether the Law Officers in Ireland have been consulted, and if it is the intention of the Government to take any notice of it.\\" Only 16 editions of The United Irishman had been produced when Mitchel was arrested, and the paper suppressed. Mitchel concluded his last article in The United Irishman, from Newgate prison, entitled \\"A Letter to Farmers\\", \\"For me, I abide my fate joyfully; for I know that whatever betide me, my work is nearly done. Yes; Moral Force and 'Patience and Perseverance' are scattered to the wild winds of heaven. The music my countrymen now love best to hear is the rattle of arms and the ring of the rifle. As I sit here, and write in my lonely cell, I hear, just dying away, the measured tramp of ten thousand marching men‚Äîmy gallant Confederates, unarmed and silent, but with hearts like bended bow, waiting till the time comes. They have marched past my prison windows to let me know that there are ten thousand fighting men in Dublin‚Äî 'felons' in heart and soul. I thank God for it. The game is afoot, at last. The liberty of Ireland may come sooner or come later, by peaceful negotiation or bloody conflict‚Äî but it is sure; and wherever between the poles I may chance to be, I will hear the crash of the down fall of the thrice-accursed British Empire.\\" Mitchel's policy on armed resistance Mitchel wrote in The Nation on 5 February 1848, \\"I say distinctly... that I do not recommend an immediate insurrection... Mr Doheny has shown most graphically how the people would be butchered if they rose in armed resistance to the poor rates; but the only resistance to rates I spoke of was passive resistance. Passive resistance was the word.\\" Michael Doheny It was Mitchel's opinion that the great mass of the Irish people were hostile to the law and the lawmakers of England, and that passive resistance could bring English law into contempt.William Dillon, Life of John Mitchel. London, 1888. Ch VI. He urged the people not to pay rent or poor rates, and to resist the forcible sale of farm produce to pay rent. Mitchel's policy has since come to be known as \\"boycotting\\". Mitchel had come to the view that \\"the whole system ought to be met with resistance at every point; and the means for this would be extremely simple; namely, a combination amongst the people to obstruct and render impossible the transport and shipment of Irish provisions; to refuse all aid in its removal; to destroy the highways, to prevent everyone, by intimidation, from daring to bid for grain or cattle if brought to auction under distress\\"; (a method of obstruction which had put an end to tithes before) \\"in short, to offer a passive resistance universally, but occasionally, when opportunity served, to try the steel.\\" Mitchel thought the time for action had come: the mass agitation of O'Connell had failed, and as to Parliamentary action, \\"I am weary of constitutional agitation, and will never lift a finger to help it more. I believe we have not the materials for it, and that the show of constitutional power we possess was exactly devised by our enemies to delude us into an endless and drift agitation. We have miserable franchises, and every day makes them worse. We have a government that first makes us poor, and then tempts our poverty with bribes and promises. We have few men of public virtue and national spirit, and in a sinking and debased province we cannot hope to rear such men more abundantly.\\" Mitchel felt that the Government would respond only to \\"armed opinion\\": \\"must the force of opinion always be legal? ‚Äì always be peaceful? Does opinion then mean law? Does opinion cease to be opinion the moment it steps out of the trenches of the constitution? Why, sir, I hold that there is no opinion in Ireland worth a farthing which is not illegal. I hold that armed opinion is a thousand times stronger than unarmed ‚Äì and further, that in a national struggle that opinion is the most potent whose sword is sharpest, and whose aim is surest. We are told it was opinion and sympathy, and other metaphysical entities that rescued Italy, and scared Austria back from Ferrara without a blow. Yes, but it was opinion with the helmet of a national guard on his head, and a long sword by his side; it was opinion, standing, match in hand, at the breech of a gun charged to the muzzle. Now, I say all this, not to vindicate myself, for I have nowhere recommended the Irish nation to attain legislative independence by force of arms in their present broken and divided condition (as Mr O'Connell's resolution imputes to me), not to vindicate myself, but to vindicate the original free constitution of our confederacy.\\" Robert Holmes, Mitchel's defence counsel Mitchel's Letter to Lord Clarendon (see below) asserted that \\"we differ from the illustrious conspirators of Ninety-Eight, not in principle ‚Äì no, not an iota ‚Äì but, as I shall presently show you, materially as to the mode of action. Theirs was a secret conspiracy ‚Äì ours is a public one. They had not learned the charm of open, honest, outspoken resistance to oppression and through their secret organization you wrought their ruin ‚Äì we defy you, and all the informers and detectives that British corruption ever bred. No espionage can tell you more than we will proclaim once a week on the house-tops. If you desire to have a Castle detective employed about the United Irishman office in Trinity Street I shall make no objection, provided the man be sober and honest. If Sir George Grey or Sir William Somerville would like to read our correspondence, we make him welcome for the present ‚Äì only let the letters be forwarded without losing a post. So that you see we get rid of the whole crew of informers at once.\\" Mitchel evidently anticipated open conflict between the Irish people and the state, but wished to await the best opportunity. He believed that passive resistance to \\"so-called law\\" could not be effectively carried out without occasional outbreaks of violence, preferably street- fighting in cities rather than in the open fields since the police and soldiers had superior arms and were better trained. Opportunities for such conditions would arise, in particular, whenever the Government attempted to arrest any of the popular leaders and the Government \\"went through the farce of trying him with a packed jury.\\" He believed that to die for one's country would be \\"honourable\\", and complained that the British monarch no longer hanged Irish rebels, depriving them of an opportunity to have a heroic death. Charged with sedition Such an opportunity arose when on 15 April 1848, legal proceedings were instigated against John Mitchel. The grand jury was called on to indict him for \\"seditious libels,\\" and also O'Brien and Meagher for seditious speeches.P.A. Sillard, Life of John Mitchel, James Duffy and Co. Ltd, 1908 Isaac Butt acted on behalf of both O'Brien and Meagher,For a better account of Butt's defence of O'Brien and Meagher read The Road to Excess by Terence White and in both cases the juries were not sufficiently packed to secure a conviction against them.Dennis Gwynn, Young Ireland and 1848, Cork University Press 1949. Mitchel's trial still remained though, and there was to be no mistake in his case. Mitchel's defence had entered a \\"dilatory plea\\" and this technical delay was seized upon by the Government. The charges of sedition against him were replaced with the newly enacted charge of Treason Felony. Jury-packing The Spectator (an English Journal) referring to the approaching trial of John Mitchel and addressing the issue of Jury Packing thus wrote: \\"Ministers were bound to take that course [Packing the Jury]. We see its inconvenience and risks,‚Äîthe additional inflation of the notoriety- hunting men in buckram; the chances of an adverse verdict from an Irish Jury; the possible tarnish on Whig popularity.\\" P. A. Sillard, one of Mitchel's biographers says that \\"In its burning hatred against the Irish the grave Spectator let out its fears of an acquittal, its fears that the jury might not be sufficiently well packed; but it might depend on Lord Clarendon that this latter all important point would not be forgotten.\\" Freeman's Journal (an Irish Newspaper) which advocated the cause of Repeal, commenting itself on the pending trial wrote: \\"The bar has been absolutely gutted of all its professional worth, and every popular man has been tempted with the bribe‚Äîand all this before a single information was sworn! All the distinguished men who defended the State prisoners in '43 have been gained over to the side of the Crown. Even the junior men were sought to be drawn off from the accused, which proves the malicious littleness of the entire transaction.\\" \\"The sneer about the \\"notoriety-hunting men\\" was also in English good taste, Sillard suggests commenting on the Spectator; \\"so accustomed are they to the like that they imagine everyone as base as themselves.\\" Treason Felony Act 1848 \\"To suppress plain-speaking in the press and at public meetings, the Government proposed a new and stringent law, by which what was only sedition, punishable by a brief imprisonment, became treason-felony, punishable by transportation for life.\\"Four Years of Irish History 1845‚Äì1849, Sir Charles Gavan Duffy, Cassell, Petter, Galpin & Co. 1888 This is how Charles Gavan Duffy described the new law. To justify his proposal for a fundamental alteration in the right of free meeting and free publication of opinion, the Home Secretary read only extracts from two or three articles and speeches, but the House found them sufficient. On its third reading, on 18 April 1848, Prime Minister Lord John Russell said \\"as long as he had any breath in him he would oppose the Repeal of the Legislative Union\\", which clearly shows the motivation behind the new act. Mitchel said in a published letter to Russell: (For the full text of the letter see here.) John Russell, 1st Earl Russell, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom 1846‚Äì1852, 1865‚Äì1866. \\"The Crown and Government... are, it seems, in danger, and want 'further security'. Security against her own beloved, highly- favoured, too-indulgently used, but ungrateful subjects! ... what is strangest than all, it seems to be from the Irish that you fear this danger most; the people whom you have been nourishing, cherishing and spoon-feeding, by means of so many kind and well-paid British nurses, for two years‚Äîon whom you have lavished so many tons of printed paper, so many millions of cooked rations‚Äîthese are the people who plot 'treason,' and eagerly flock to hear 'open and advised speaking,' eagerly devour 'published, printed, and written' language all urging them to arm for the overthrow of British rule in Ireland!\\" Newgate Prison where John Mitchel was detained 1848 On 13 May, while having dinner with his family, Mitchel was served a warrant for his arrest on two charges of \\"felony\\" under the new Act. He was accompanied to the Police office by his brother William and Thomas Devin Reilly. The chief Police Magistrate Mr Porter handed Mitchel a warrant for his committal, which affirmed that \\"John Mitchel... did wilfully and feloniously compass, imagine, invent, devise, and intend to deprive and depose our most Gracious Lady the Queen, from the style, honour, and royal name of the imperial crown of the United Kingdom, and levy war against her Majesty, in order, by force and constraint, to compel her to change her measures and counsels; and such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, and intentions, did... express, utter and declare, by publishing certain printings in a certain news paper called The United Irishman.\\" Trial and sentence Trial of John Mitchel in Green Street Courthouse The Commission Court opened on 20 May, and Baron Lefroy proceeded to charge the grand jury. On Monday the foreman handed down a true bill against Mitchel. The Clerk of the Crown asked for what the bill was. To illustrate the rapidity with which the whole case was despatched; and the absolute indifference \\"whether there was justice done or not,\\" P.A. Sillard, one of Mitchel's biographers, quoted from the speech of Mitchel's defence Council Robert Holms, \\"The foreman of the Grand Jury, gentlemen, having been asked if the jury had found bills against the prisoner‚Äîreplied‚Äî 'Oh yes, we find him guilty of sedition.' 'Gentlemen,' said the officer of the court, 'he is not indicted for sedition.' 'Well,' said the fore man, 'we find him guilty of treason.' 'But, gentlemen,' again interrupted the officer, 'the charge against Mr Mitchel is for felony.' 'Oh, no matter!' said the foreman, 'sedition, treason, or felony, it is all the same to us.\\" Sillard concluded, \\"Justice! the thing is not to be had in British law courts. The petty jury having been sworn, the remaining portion of this awful scene was very quickly gone through.\\" The Attorney-General stated the case and endeavoured to defend himself against the accusation of having tampered with the jury-list. The witnesses were then examined, and at 12.15pm, Robert Holmes, a veteran Republican of '98, and the brother-in-law of Robert Emmet, rose to address the jury on behalf of the prisoner. This was to be his last ever speech, and in it took the views of the prisoner and made them his own. It was according to Sillard \\"the grand old Republican of '98 resolved to attest the justice of the Republican of a later day, and hurl defiance in the face of English law.\\" (For the full text of the speech see here.) Holmes having concluded his speech, counsel for the Crown, Mr Henn, replied. Judge Moore then charged the jury, who retired to consider their verdict, which after some time they brought in and handed down to the clerk of the Crown. That verdict was \\"Guilty.\\" On the following morning, the clerk of the Crown went through formality of asking if Mitchel had anything to say why sentence should not be passed upon him. Mitchel said: \\"I have to say that I have been found guilty by a packed jury‚Äîby the jury of a partisan sheriff‚Äîby a jury not empanelled even according to the law of England. That is the reason I object to the sentence being passed upon me.\\" Baron Lefroy then proceeded to pass sentence. He denied that the jury had been packed, reiterated the offences mentioned in the indictment, and concluded by saying:‚Äî \\"I wish you to understand [addressing Mitchel] that we have, with the utmost anxiety, and with a view to come to a decision upon the measure of punishment which it would be our duty to impose, postponed the passing of sentence upon you till this morning. We have with the utmost deliberation, examined the matter, with an anxiety to duly discharge the duty which we owe on all hands‚Äî the duty which we owe the prisoner of not meting out punishment beyond the just measure of the offence, and the duty we owe to the public that the degree of punishment will be such as to carry out the object of all punishment, which is not the mere infliction of the penalty upon the person convicted, but the prevention of crime‚Äîthat that punishment should carry with it a security to the country, as far as possible, that one who has offended so perseveringly‚Äîthat so deliberate a violator of the law shall not be permitted to continue his course of conduct to the disturbance of its peace and prosperity. We had to consider all this‚Äîto look at the magnitude of the crime, and to look also at the consideration that if this were not the first case brought under the Act, our duty might have obliged us to carry out the penalty it awards to the utmost extent; but taking into consideration that this is the first conviction under the Act‚Äîthough the offence has been as clearly proved as any offence of the kind could be‚Äîthe sentence of the court is that you, John Mitchel, be transported beyond the seas for the term of fourteen years.\\" An eruption of indignation followed and as soon as silence had been restored, Mitchel delivered his opinion. Speech from the dock \\"The law has now done its part, and the Queen of England, her crown and Government in Ireland, are now secure pursuant to Act of Parliament. I have done my part also. Three months ago I promised Lord Clarendon, and his government, in this country, that I would provoke him into his courts of justice, as places of this kind are called, and that I would force him publicly and notoriously to pack a Jury against me to convict me, or else that if I would walk out a free man from this dock, to meet him in another field. My lord, I knew I was setting my life on that cast; but I warned him that in either event the victory would be with me, and the victory is with me. Neither the jury, nor the judges, nor any other man in this court, presumes to imagine that it is a criminal who stands in this dock. I have kept my word. \\"I have shown what the law is made of in Ireland. I have shown that her Majesty's Government sustains itself in Ireland by packed juries by partisan judges, by perjured sheriffs. I have acted all through this business, from the first, under a strong sense of duty. I do not repent anything I have done: and I believe that the course which I have opened is only commenced, The Roman who saw his hand burning to ashes before the tyrant, promised that three hundred should follow out his enterprise, Can I not promise [Mitchel looking at Martin, Reilly, and Meagher, who stood round the dock] for one, for two, for three, aye, for hundreds.\\" According to Mitchel's biographers, an outburst of passion followed this speech, and several voices exclaimed, \\"Yes, Mitchel, for thousands.\\" \\"And promise for me,\\" as Mitchel was led away. Deportation and the Jail Journal Mitchel was one of the first prisoners held on prison island Spike Island where he spent 3 days before being transported to Ireland Island, Bermuda, where the Royal Navy was notoriously using convict labour to carve out a dockyard and naval base. Bermuda had long been used as a penal colony. In the 17th century, numerous Irish Prisoners-of-War (POW) and civilians were sent to Bermuda (see Irish Diaspora) and sold into servitude following Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Ireland. (Bermuda would be used as late as the Second Boer War as a place to which Boer POWs were removed). In the 19th century, owing to a lack of manual labourers in Bermuda, the Royal Navy had begun using convicts from British and Irish prisons to build its dockyard. These men were housed in prison hulks, where many succumbed to disease, particularly yellow fever. Convicts were treated harshly, and worked hard. Conditions were severe enough to lead to prison revolts, and the executions of rioters. Surviving his time in Bermuda, Mitchel was then sent to the penal colony of Van Diemen's Land (modern-day Tasmania, Australia). It was during this journey he wrote his Jail Journal, in which he repudiated British policy in Ireland and advocated a more radical brand of nationalism. HMD Bermuda, Ireland Island, Bermuda. The United States John Mitchel, Last portrait 1875 Mitchel, aided by Patrick James Smyth, escaped from the colony in 1853 and settled in the United States, where he edited the collections of the poetry of Mangan and Davis.The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps) 1860 He established the radical Irish nationalist newspaper The Citizen in New York, as an expression of radical Irish-American anti-British opinion.History Ireland, May 2007, p.30. The paper was controversial for its defence of slavery by highlighting the (supposed) hypocrisy of the abolitionists in the debate. Racism and pro-slavery advocacy Mitchel claimed that slaves in the southern United States were better cared for and fed than Irish cottiers, or industrial workers in English cities like Manchester. He was explicitly racist, saying negroes were \\"an innately inferior people\\"Southern Citizen: John Mitchel, the Confederacy and slavery, History Ireland, May 2007. and opining \\"We deny that it is a crime, or a wrong, or even a peccadillo to hold slaves, to buy slaves, to keep slaves to their work by flogging or other needful correction. We wish we had a good plantation well-stocked with healthy negroes in Alabama.\\"The Great Dan, Charles Chevenix Trench, Jonathan Cape Ltd, (London 1984), p. 274. In correspondence with his good friend John Kenyon, he stated that he wanted to make the people of the US \\"proud and fond of [slavery] as a national institution, and advocate its extension by re-opening the trade in Negroes.\\" He claimed that slavery was inherently moral and \\"good in itself\\" and stated that he \\"promotes it for its own sake.\\" Mitchel's views on slavery were very unpopular in the Young Ireland movement as a whole. Mitchel was a critic of international capitalism, which he blamed for both the pending Civil War and the Great Hunger.History Ireland, May 2007, p. 32. In 1861 Mitchel wrote The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps), a jeremiad accusing the English of \\"deliberate murder\\" for their actions during the 1845 Irish famine. This tract did much to establish the widespread view, as Mitchel famously put it, that \\"The Almighty, indeed, sent the potato blight, but the English created the Famine.\\" He opposed the emancipation of the Jews, which he considered against the will of God. Mitchel resigned from the paper and toured as a spokesman for the South. In 1857 in Knoxville, Tennessee, he founded a new paper, the Southern Citizen, to promote \\"the value and virtue of slavery, both for negroes and white men\\", advocate the reopening of the African slave trade and encourage the spread of slavery into the American West. He moved the paper to Washington in 1859. When the Civil War broke out in 1861 he moved to Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital, to edit the powerful Richmond Enquirer. As a spokesman for the cause of the South, he was the first to claim that slavery and abolition were not the cause of the conflict but simply used as a pretence. Two of his sons died in the war, and a third lost an arm. He equated the Confederacy with Ireland, claiming that both were agricultural economies tied to an unjust union. The Union States and England were \\"..the commercial, manufacturing and money-broking power ... greedy, grabbing, griping and grovelling\\". Mitchel fell out with Jefferson Davis, whom he regarded as too moderate. He described Abraham Lincoln as \\"... an ignoramus and a boor; not an apostle at all; no grand reformer, not so much as an abolitionist, except by accident ‚Äì a man of very small account in every way.\\"History Ireland, May 2007, p. 34. Mitchel moved to New York City in 1865 to edit the Daily News. The Tweed Machine put him in prison for a short time but he was released with the assistance of the Fenians. Slavery was dead and Mitchel returned his focus to the issue of Ireland. He founded his third American newspaper, the Irish Citizen in New York City, but the paper failed to attract readers and folded in 1872. In part this was because he used it to criticise the Irish-born Catholic archbishop of New York, John Hughes. Mitchel worked for a time in Paris as financial agent for the Fenians before again returning to the States. Mitchel's Irish nationalism went over the line into Anglophobia. According to Malcolm Brown, Mitchel hated almost everything he came across, including the Jews and Britain. Elected an MP John Mitchel, Paris, 1861 Mitchel returned to Ireland where in 1875 he was elected in a by- election to be a member of the Parliament of the United Kingdom representing the Tipperary constituency. However his election was invalidated on the grounds that he was a convicted felon. He contested the seat again in the resulting by-election, again being elected, this time with an increased vote. At the time of his sudden death, an election petition had been lodged, and the courts subsequently decided that voters in Tipperary had known that Mitchel was ineligible. Therefore, the seat was awarded to his Conservative opponent. Legacy Statue of John Mitchel in Newry \\"John Mitchel 1815‚Äì1875 After twenty seven years in the exile for the sake of Ireland he returned with honour to die among his own people and he rests with his parents in the 1st Presbyterian Old Meeting House green at Newry.\\" A significant number of Gaelic Athletic Association clubs are named in his honour, including Newry Mitchel's GFC in his home town, John Mitchel's Claudy, Castlebar Mitchels GAA, John Mitchel's Glenullin, John Mitchel's Liverpool and others both north and south of the border, as well as several in England and Australia. A statue to Mitchel was also erected by the people of Newry, and is located at John Mitchel Place, an extension of Newry's main street, Hill Street. Mitchel Park is named after him in Dungiven, Northern Ireland, as is Mitchell County, Iowa, in the United States. Fort Mitchel on Spike Island is named in his honour. Mitchel is remembered for his involvement in radical nationalism, and in particular for writings such as \\"Jail Journal\\", \\"The Last Conquest of Ireland (Perhaps)\\", \\"The History of Ireland\\", \\"An Apology for the British Government in Ireland\\", and the less well known \\"The Life of Hugh O'Neill\\".

They were originally billed as The Trenier Twins, who performed alongside the Gene Gilbeaux Quartet, but shortened their name to The Treniers when Gilbeaux and other musicians became integral members of the group. Besides the Trenier brothers, group members included Don Hill on saxophone, Shifty Henry and later James (Jimmy) Johnson on bass, Henry (Tucker) Green on drums and Gene Gilbeaux on piano. Later, additional Trenier brothers Milt and Buddy, and nephew Skip, joined the group on vocals, and there were many other musician and line-up changes over the years including Herman Washington and Mickey Baker on guitar. Career The band was based around twins Clifton L. \\"Cliff\\" Trenier (July 14, 1919 - March 2, 1983) and Claude Oliver Trenier (July 14, 1919 - November 17, 2003). They were born in Mobile, Alabama, and formed the Alabama State Collegians when in college together in 1939. In 1943, Claude Trenier left to join Jimmie Lunceford's band as lead singer, and Cliff joined him the following year.Dik de Heer, \\"The Treniers\\", Black Cat Rockabilly. Accessed 31 November 2014 The twins left the Lunceford band in 1947 and began performing together as the Trenier Twins, backed by the Gene Gilbeaux Quartet which included Gene Gilbeaux on piano and Don Hill on alto sax. They made their first recordings for Mercury Records in 1947, and developed a strong reputation for their live performances. In 1949, they were joined by older brother Buddy Trenier (December 11, 1913 - March 15, 1999), and started to be billed as \\"The Rockin' Rollin' Treniers\\". They played a form of music intermediate between swing and early rock and roll. Though their sound is more swing influenced, the Treniers incorporated a thumping backbeat and several songs that included the words \\"rock\\" and \\"roll\\" - \\"Rocking on Sunday Night\\" and \\"It Rocks! It Rolls! It Swings!\\", for example, and in the 1940s were already playing \\"Rockin' Is Our Bizness,\\" which was inspired by Jimmie Lunceford's \\"Rhythm Is Our Business\\" from the 1930s. They were also known for the humorous content of many of their songs, and their on stage acrobatics were seen as precursors to the wild antics of many later rock and roll groups. Their lively stage presentation influenced Bill Haley and Comets, The Shadows in the UK in 1959, Paul Revere and Raiders, and beyond. They had their only national chart hit in 1951, when \\"Go! Go! Go!\\" reached #10 on the R&B; chart, but several of their other records including \\"It Rocks! It Rolls! It Swings!\\" (1952) and \\"Rockin' Is Our Bizness\\" (1953) \\"anticipated some crucial elements of rock n roll with their solid, thumping beats, their squealing sax solos.\\" In the 1950s, they moved closer towards an R&B; influenced sound, but were unable to weather the influx of rock and roll. Nonetheless the group was considered a strong influence on bands such as their contemporaries Bill Haley and His Comets, and they were one of the first to record Haley's \\"Rock-a- Beatin' Boogie\\".Rcs-discography.com Claude Trenier would later claim in an interview in Blue Suede News magazine that his group was responsible for Haley deciding to record rock and roll; this account is disputed. One of the first times rock and roll appeared on national television was in May 1954 when the Treniers appeared on the Colgate Comedy Hour, hosted by Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. During the playing of their songs, Martin and Lewis participated in the antics, and when the drummer got up and stepped aside, Jerry Lewis sat down and played drums for one song. The group appeared in several films in the 1950s including The Girl Can't Help It and Don't Knock the Rock (which also featured Haley), and continued to perform as recently as 2003. In 1955, the group released the song \\"Say Hey (The Willie Mays Song)\\" about Giants center fielder, Willie Mays, which included some dialogue by the Hall-of-Famer himself. The song is included on the soundtrack to Ken Burns 1994 documentary Baseball. In 2013, surviving member Milt Trenier performed semi-weekly at Chicago area restaurants.

Nicknamed \\"Sassy\\" and \\"The Divine One\\", she won four Grammy Awards, including the Lifetime Achievement Award. She was given an NEA Jazz Masters Award in 1989. Critic Scott Yanow wrote that she had \\"one of the most wondrous voices of the 20th century\\". Early life Vaughan's father, Asbury \\"Jake\\" Vaughan, was a carpenter by trade and played guitar and piano. Her mother, Ada Vaughan, was a laundress who sang in the church choir. The Vaughans lived in a house on Brunswick Street in Newark for Vaughan's entire childhood. Jake was deeply religious. The family was active in New Mount Zion Baptist Church at 186 Thomas Street. Vaughan began piano lessons at the age of seven, sang in the church choir, and played piano for rehearsals and services. She developed an early love for popular music on records and the radio. In the 1930s, she frequently saw local and touring bands at the Montgomery Street Skating Rink. By her mid-teens, she began venturing illegally into Newark's night clubs and performing as a pianist and singer at the Piccadilly Club and the Newark Airport. Vaughan attended East Side High School, then transferred to Newark Arts High School, which opened in 1931. As her nocturnal adventures as a performer overwhelmed her academic pursuits, she dropped out of high school during her junior year to concentrate on music. Career=1942‚Äì43: Early career= Vaughan was frequently accompanied by a friend, Doris Robinson, on her trips into New York City. In the fall of 1942, by which time she was 18 years old, Vaughan suggested that Robinson enter the Apollo Theater Amateur Night contest. Vaughan played piano accompaniment for Robinson, who won second prize. Vaughan later decided to go back and compete as a singer herself. She sang \\"Body and Soul\\", and won‚Äîalthough the date of this victorious performance is uncertain. The prize, as Vaughan recalled to Marian McPartland, was $10 and the promise of a week's engagement at the Apollo. On November 20, 1942, she returned to the Apollo to open for Ella Fitzgerald. During her week of performances at the Apollo, Vaughan was introduced to bandleader and pianist Earl Hines, although the details of that introduction are disputed. Billy Eckstine, Hines' singer at the time, has been credited by Vaughan and others with hearing her at the Apollo and recommending her to Hines. Hines claimed later to have discovered her himself and offered her a job on the spot. After a brief tryout at the Apollo, Hines replaced his female singer with Vaughan on April 4, 1943. =1943‚Äì44: Earl Hines and Billy Eckstine= Vaughan spent the remainder of 1943 and part of 1944 touring the country with the Earl Hines big band, which featured Billy Eckstine. She was hired as a pianist so Hines could hire her under the jurisdiction of the musicians' union (American Federation of Musicians) rather than the singers union (American Guild of Variety Artists). But after Cliff Smalls joined the band as a trombonist and pianist, her duties were limited to singing. The Earl Hines band in this period is remembered as an incubator of bebop, as it included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, saxophonist Charlie Parker (playing tenor saxophone rather than alto), and trombonist Bennie Green. Gillespie arranged for the band, although the contemporary recording ban by the musicians' union meant that no commercial recordings exist. Eckstine quit the Hines band in late 1943 and formed a big band with Gillespie, leaving Hines to become the band's musical director. Parker joined Eckstine, and over the next few years the band included Gene Ammons, Art Blakey, Miles Davis, Kenny Dorham, Dexter Gordon, and Lucky Thompson. Vaughan accepted Eckstine's invitation to join his band in 1944, giving her the opportunity to record for the first time on December 5, 1944, on the song. \\"I'll Wait and Pray\\" for De Luxe. Critic and producer Leonard Feather asked her to record later that month for Continental with a septet that included Dizzy Gillespie and Georgie Auld. She left the Eckstine band in late 1944 to pursue a solo career, although she remained close to Eckstine and recorded with him frequently. Pianist John Malachi is credited with giving Vaughan the moniker \\"Sassy\\", a nickname that matched her personality. She liked it, and the name and its shortened variant \\"Sass\\" stuck with colleagues and the press. In written communications, Vaughan often spelled it \\"Sassie\\". =1945‚Äì48: Early solo career = 344x344px Vaughan began her solo career in 1945 by freelancing on 52nd Street in New York City at the Three Deuces, the Famous Door, the Downbeat, and the Onyx Club. She spent time at Braddock Grill next to the Apollo Theater in Harlem. On May 11, 1945, she recorded \\"Lover Man\\" for Guild with a quintet featuring Gillespie and Parker with Al Haig on piano, Curly Russell on double bass, and Sid Catlett on drums. Later that month, she went into the studio with a slightly different and larger Gillespie/Parker aggregation and recorded three more sides. After being invited by violinist Stuff Smith to record the song \\"Time and Again\\" in October 1945, Vaughan was offered a contract to record for Musicraft by owner Albert Marx, although she would not begin recording as a leader for Musicraft until May 7, 1946. In the intervening time, she recorded for Crown and Gotham and began performing regularly at Caf√© Society Downtown, an integrated club in New York's Sheridan Square. While at Caf√© Society, Vaughan became friends with trumpeter George Treadwell, who became her manager. She delegated to him most of the musical director responsibilities for her recording sessions, allowing her to concentrate on singing. Over the next few years, Treadwell made changes in Vaughan's stage appearance. Aside from a new wardrobe and hair style, she had her teeth capped, eliminating a gap between her two front teeth. Her recordings for Musicraft included \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" (written and arranged by Tadd Dameron), \\"Don't Blame Me\\", \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\", \\"Everything I Have Is Yours\\" and \\"Body and Soul\\". With Vaughan and Treadwell's professional relationship on solid footing, the couple married on September 16, 1946. In 1947, Vaughan performed at the third Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on September 7, 1947. The Valdez Orchestra, The Blenders, T-Bone Walker, Slim Gaillard, The Honeydrippers, Johnny Otis and his Orchestra, Woody Herman, and the Three Blazers also performed that same day.‚ÄúStarry‚Äô Day at Cavalcade of Jazz‚Äù, Los Angeles Sentinel, September 4, 1947. Vaughan's recording success for Musicraft continued through 1947 and 1948. Her recording of \\"Tenderly\\"‚Äîshe was proud to be the first to have recorded that jazz standardSaid by Sarah Vaughan herself in her introduction to singing \\"Tenderly\\" Live in Sweden in 1958 (on Youtube).‚Äîbecame an unexpected pop hit in late 1947. Her December 27, 1947, recording of \\"It's Magic\\" (from the Doris Day film Romance on the High Seas) found chart success in early 1948. Her recording of \\"Nature Boy\\" from April 8, 1948, became a hit around the time the popular Nat King Cole version was released. Because of a second recording ban by the musicians' union, \\"Nature Boy\\" was recorded with an a cappella choir. =1948‚Äì53: Stardom and the Columbia years= The musicians' union ban pushed Musicraft to the brink of bankruptcy. Vaughan used the missed royalty payments as an opportunity to sign with the larger Columbia record label. After the settling of legal issues, her chart successes continued with \\"Black Coffee\\" in the summer of 1949. While at Columbia through 1953, she was steered almost exclusively to commercial pop ballads, several with success on the charts: \\"That Lucky Old Sun\\", \\"Make Believe (You Are Glad When You're Sorry)\\", \\"I'm Crazy to Love You\\", \\"Our Very Own\\", \\"I Love the Guy\\", \\"Thinking of You\\" (with pianist Bud Powell), \\"I Cried for You\\", \\"These Things I Offer You\\", \\"Vanity\\", \\"I Ran All the Way Home\\", \\"Saint or Sinner\\", \\"My Tormented Heart\\", and \\"Time\\". She won Esquire magazine's New Star Award for 1947, awards from Down Beat magazine from 1947 to 1952, and from Metronome magazine from 1948 to 1953. Recording and critical success led to performing opportunities, with Vaughan singing to large crowds in clubs around the country during the late 1940s and early 1950s. In the summer of 1949, she made her first appearance with a symphony orchestra in a benefit for the Philadelphia Orchestra entitled \\"100 Men and a Girl.\\" Around this time, Chicago disk jockey Dave Garroway coined a second nickname for her, \\"The Divine One\\", that would follow her throughout her career. One of her early television appearances was on DuMont's variety show Stars on Parade (1953‚Äì54) in which she sang \\"My Funny Valentine\\" and \\"Linger Awhile\\". In 1949, with their finances improving, Vaughan and Treadwell bought a three-story house on 21 Avon Avenue in Newark, occupying the top floor during their increasingly rare off-hours at home and moving Vaughan's parents to the lower two floors. However, business pressures and personality conflicts led to a cooling in Treadwell and Vaughan's relationship. Treadwell hired a road manager to handle her touring needs and opened a management office in Manhattan so he could work with other clients. Vaughan's relationship with Columbia soured as she became dissatisfied with the commercial material and its lackluster financial success. She made some small-group recordings in 1950 with Miles Davis and Bennie Green, but they were atypical of what she recorded for Columbia. Radio In 1949, Vaughan had a radio program, Songs by Sarah Vaughan, on WMGM in New York City. The 15-minute shows were broadcast in the evenings on Wednesday through Sunday from The Clique Club, described as \\"rendezvous of the bebop crowd.\\" She was accompanied by George Shearing on piano, Oscar Pettiford on double bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums. =1954‚Äì59: Mercury years= Vaughan in 1955 In 1953, Treadwell negotiated a contract for Vaughan with Mercury in which she would record commercial material for Mercury and jazz-oriented material for its subsidiary, EmArcy. She was paired with producer Bob Shad, and their working relationship yielded commercial and artistic success. Her debut recording session at Mercury took place in February 1954. She remained with Mercury through 1959. After recording for Roulette from 1960 to 1963, she returned to Mercury from 1964 to 1967. Her commercial success at Mercury began with the 1954 hit \\"Make Yourself Comfortable\\", recorded in the fall of 1954, and continued with \\"How Important Can It Be\\" (with Count Basie), \\"Whatever Lola Wants\\", \\"The Banana Boat Song\\", \\"You Ought to Have a Wife\\", and \\"Misty\\". Her commercial success peaked in 1959 with \\"Broken Hearted Melody\\", a song she considered \\"corny\\" which nevertheless became her first gold record, and a regular part of her concert repertoire for years to come. Vaughan was reunited with Billy Eckstine for a series of duet recordings in 1957 that yielded the hit \\"Passing Strangers\\". Her commercial recordings were handled by a number of arrangers and conductors, primarily Hugo Peretti and Hal Mooney. The jazz \\"track\\" of her recording career proceeded apace, backed either by her working trio or combinations of jazz musicians. One of her favorite albums was a 1954 sextet date that included Clifford Brown. In the latter half of the 1950s she followed a schedule of almost non-stop touring. She was featured at the first Newport Jazz Festival in the summer of 1954 and starred in subsequent editions of that festival at Newport and in New York City for the remainder of her life. In the fall of 1954, she performed at Carnegie Hall with the Count Basie Orchestra on a bill that also included Billie Holiday, Charlie Parker, Lester Young and the Modern Jazz Quartet. That fall, she again toured Europe before embarking on a \\"Big Show\\" U.S. tour, a succession of performances that included Count Basie, George Shearing, Erroll Garner and Jimmy Rushing. At the 1955 New York Jazz Festival on Randalls Island, Vaughan shared the bill with the Dave Brubeck quartet, Horace Silver, Jimmy Smith, and the Johnny Richards Orchestra. Although the professional relationship between Vaughan and Treadwell was quite successful through the 1950s, their personal relationship finally reached a breaking point and she filed for a divorce in 1958. Vaughan had entirely delegated financial matters to Treadwell, and despite significant income figures reported through the 1950s, at the settlement Treadwell said that only $16,000 remained. The couple evenly divided the amount and their personal assets, terminating their business relationship. She made her UK debut in 1958 at Sunday Night at the London Palladium with several songs including \\"Who's Got the Last Laugh Now\\".Rebroadcast of Sunday Night at the London Palladium 17.5.2020 =1959‚Äì69: Atkins and Roulette = The exit of Treadwell from Vaughan's life was precipitated by the entry of Clyde \\"C.B.\\" Atkins, a man of uncertain background whom she had met in Chicago and married on September 4, 1959. Although Atkins had no experience in artist management or music, Vaughan wished to have a mixed professional and personal relationship like the one she had with Treadwell. She made Atkins her manager, although she was still feeling the sting of the problems she had with Treadwell and initially kept a closer eye on Atkins. Vaughan and Atkins moved into a house in Englewood, New Jersey. When Vaughan's contract with Mercury ended in late 1959, she signed on with Roulette, a small label owned by Morris Levy, who was one of the backers of Birdland, where she frequently appeared. She began recording for Roulette in April 1960, making a string of large ensemble albums arranged or conducted by Billy May, Jimmy Jones, Joe Reisman, Quincy Jones, Benny Carter, Lalo Schifrin, and Gerald Wilson. She had pop chart success in 1960 with \\"Serenata\\" on Roulette and \\"Eternally\\" and \\"You're My Baby\\", a couple of residual tracks from her Mercury contract. She recorded After Hours (1961) with guitarist Mundell Lowe and double bassist George Duvivier and Sarah + 2 (1962) with guitarist Barney Kessel and double bassist Joe Comfort. In 1961 Vaughan and Atkins adopted a daughter, Deborah Lois Atkins, known professionally as Paris Vaughan. However, the relationship with Atkins proved difficult and violent. After several incidents, she filed for divorce in November 1963. She turned to two friends to help sort out the financial affairs of the marriage. Club owner John \\"Preacher\\" Wells, a childhood acquaintance, and Clyde \\"Pumpkin\\" Golden Jr. discovered that Atkins' gambling and spending had put Vaughan around $150,000 in debt. The Englewood house was seized by the IRS for nonpayment of taxes. Vaughan retained custody of their child and Golden took Atkins' place as Vaughan's manager and lover for the remainder of the decade. When her contract with Roulette ended in 1963, Vaughan returned to the more familiar confines of Mercury. In the summer of 1963, she went to Denmark with producer Quincy Jones to record Sassy Swings the Tivoli, an album of live performances with her trio. During the next year, she made her first appearance at White House for President Lyndon Johnson. The Tivoli recording would be the brightest moment of her second stint with Mercury. Changing demographics and tastes in the 1960s left jazz musicians with shrinking audiences and inappropriate material. Although she retained a following large and loyal enough to maintain her career, the quality and quantity of her recorded output dwindled as her voice darkened and her skill remained undiminished. At the conclusion of her Mercury deal in 1967, she lacked a recording contract for the remainder of the decade. =1970‚Äì82: Fisher and Mainstream= Dizzy Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan perform at the White House in honor of the Shah of Iran on November 15, 1977. In 1971, at the Tropicana in Las Vegas, Marshall Fisher was a concession stand employee and fan when he was introduced to Sarah Vaughan. They were attracted to each other immediately. Fisher moved in with her in Los Angeles. Although he was white and seven years older, he got along with her friends and family. Although he had no experience in the music business, he became her road manager, then personal manager. But unlike other men and managers, Fisher was devoted to her and meticulously managed her career and treated her well. He wrote love poems to her. In 1971, Bob Shad, who had worked with her as producer at Mercury, asked her to record for his label, Mainstream, which he had founded after leaving Mercury. Breaking a four-year hiatus, Vaughan signed a contract with Mainstream and returned to the studio for A Time in My Life, a step away from jazz into pop music with songs by Bob Dylan, John Lennon, and Marvin Gaye arranged by Ernie Wilkins. She didn't complain about this eclectic change in direction, but she chose the material for her next album after admiring the work of Michel Legrand. He conducted an orchestra of over one hundred musicians for Sarah Vaughan with Michel Legrand, an album of compositions by Legrand with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. The songs brought some of the musicians to tears during the sessions. But Shad wanted a hit, and the album yielded none. She sang a version of the pop hit \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" by the Carpenters for Feelin' Good. This was followed by Live in Japan, her first live album since 1963. Sarah Vaughan and the Jimmy Rowles Quintet (1974) was more experimental, containing free improvisation and some unconventional scatting. Send in the Clowns was another attempt to increase sales by breaking into the pop music market. Vaughan disliked the songs and hated the album cover depicting a clown with an afro. She filed a lawsuit against Shad in 1975 on the belief that the cover was inconsistent with the formal, sophisticated image she projected on stage. She also contended that the album Sarah Vaughan: Live at the Holiday Inn Lesotho had an incorrect title and that Shad had been harming her career. Although she disliked the album, she liked the song \\"Send in the Clowns\\" written by Steven Sondheim for the musical A Little Night Music. She learned it on piano, made many changes with the help of pianist Carl Schroeder, and it became her signature song. In 1974, she performed music by George Gershwin at the Hollywood Bowl with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. The orchestra was conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas, who was a fan of Vaughan and invited her to perform. Thomas and Vaughan repeated the performance with Thomas' home orchestra in Buffalo, New York, followed by appearances in 1975 and 1976 with other symphony orchestras in the United States. After leaving Mainstream, she signed with Atlantic and worked on an album of songs by John Lennon and Paul McCartney that were arranged by Marty Paich and his son, David Paich of the rock band Toto. She was enthusiastic to be more involved in the making of an album, but Atlantic rejected it on the claim that it contained no hits. \\"I don't know how they can recognize hits in advance\\", she said. Atlantic canceled her contract. She said, \\"I don't give a damn about record companies any more\\". =Rio and Norman Granz= In 1977, filmmaker Thomas Guy followed Vaughan on tour to film the documentary Listen to the Sun. She traveled throughout South America: Argentina, Columbia, Chile, Ecuador, and Peru. She was enamored of Brazil, as this was her third tour of Brazil in six years. In the documentary she called the city of Rio \\"the greatest place I think I've ever been on earth\\". Audiences were so enthusiastic that she said, \\"I don't believe they like me that much.\\" After rejection by Atlantic, she wanted to try producing her own album of Brazilian music. She asked Alo√≠sio de Oliveira to run the sessions and recorded I Love Brazil! with Milton Nascimento, Jose Roberto Bertrami, Dorival Caymmi, and Antonio Carlos Jobim. She had an album but no label to release it, so she signed to Pablo run by Norman Granz. She had known Granz since 1948 when she performed on one of his Jazz at the Philharmonic tours. He was the record producer and manager for Ella Fitzgerald and the owner of Verve. After selling Verve, he started Pablo. He was dedicated to acoustic, mainstream jazz and had recorded Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Clark Terry. In 1978 he recorded Vaughan's How Long Has This Been Going On?, a set of jazz standards with veteran jazz musicians Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass, Ray Brown, and Louis Bellson. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. Pablo released I Love Brazil! and it, too, was nominated for a Grammy. =1982‚Äì89: Late career= Sarah Vaughan and Billy Eckstine at Monterey Jazz Festival in 1981 In the summer of 1980 she received a plaque on 52nd Street outside the CBS Building (Black Rock) commemorating the jazz clubs she had once frequented on \\"Swing Street\\" and which had long since been replaced with office buildings. A performance of her symphonic Gershwin program with the New Jersey Symphony in 1980 was broadcast on PBS and won her an Emmy Award the next year for Individual Achievement, Special Class. She was reunited in 1982 with Tilson Thomas for a modified version of the Gershwin program, played again by the Los Angeles Philharmonic but this time in its home hall, the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion; the CBS recording of the concert Gershwin Live! won a Grammy for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female. After the end of her contract with Pablo in 1982, she committed to a limited number of studio recordings. She made a guest appearance in 1984 on Barry Manilow's 2:00 AM Paradise Cafe, an album of pastiche compositions with established jazz musicians. In 1984, she participated in The Planet is Alive, Let It Live a symphonic piece composed by Tito Fontana and Sante Palumbo on Italian translations of Polish poems by Karol Wojtyla, better known as Pope John Paul II. The recording was made in Germany with an English translation by writer Gene Lees and was released by Lees on his private label after the recording was rejected by the major labels. In 1985 Vaughan reconnected with her longstanding, continually growing European audience during a celebratory concert at the Chatelet Theater in Paris. Released posthumously on the Justin Time label, In the City of Lights is a two-disc recording of the concert, which covers the highlights of Vaughan's career while capturing a beloved singer at the height of her powers. Thanks in part to the hard-swinging telepathic support of pianist Frank Collett (who answers each of her challenges then coaxes the same from her), Sarah reprises Tad Dameron's \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" with uncommon power, her breathstream effecting a seamless connection between chorus and bridge. For the Gershwin Medley, drummer Harold Jones swaps his brushes for sticks to match energy and forcefulness that does not let up until the last of many encores. In 1986, Vaughan sang \\"Happy Talk\\" and \\"Bali Ha'i\\" in the role of Bloody Mary on a studio recording by Kiri Te Kanawa and Jos√© Carreras of the score of the Broadway musical South Pacific, while sitting on the studio floor. Vaughan's final album was Brazilian Romance, produced by S√©rgio Mendes with songs by Milton Nascimento and Dori Caymmi. It was recorded primarily in the early part of 1987 in New York and Detroit. In 1988, she contributed vocals to an album of Christmas carols recorded by the Mormon Tabernacle Choir with the Utah Symphony Orchestra and sold in Hallmark Cards stores. In 1989, Quincy Jones' album Back on the Block included Vaughan in a brief scatting duet with Ella Fitzgerald. This was her final studio recording. It was her only studio recording with Fitzgerald in a career that had begun 46 years earlier opening for Fitzgerald at the Apollo. The video Sarah Vaughan Live from Monterey was taped in 1983 or 1984 with her trio and guest soloists. Sass and Brass was taped in 1986 in New Orleans with guests Dizzy Gillespie and Maynard Ferguson. Sarah Vaughan: The Divine One was part of the American Masters series on PBS. Also in 1986, on Independence Day in a program nationally televised on PBS she performed with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, in a medley of songs composed by George Gershwin. Death In 1989, Vaughan's health began to decline, although she rarely revealed any hints of this in her performances. She canceled a series of engagements in Europe in 1989, citing the need to seek treatment for arthritis of the hand, although she was able to complete a series of performances in Japan. During a run at New York's Blue Note Jazz Club in 1989, she was diagnosed with lung cancer and was too ill to finish the last day of what would turn out to be her final series of public performances. Vaughan returned to her home in California to begin chemotherapy and spent her final months alternating stays in the hospital and at home. She grew weary of the struggle and demanded to be taken home, where at the age of 66 she died on the evening of April 3, 1990, while watching a television movie featuring her daughter. Her funeral was held at Mount Zion Baptist Church, 208 Broadway in Newark, New Jersey. Following the ceremony, a horse-drawn carriage transported her body to Glendale Cemetery, Bloomfield in New Jersey.Notable American Women Vocal commentary Parallels have been drawn between Vaughan's voice and that of opera singers. Jazz singer Betty Carter said that with training Vaughan could have \\"...gone as far as Leontyne Price.\\" Bob James, Vaughan's musical director in the 1960s said that \\"...the instrument was there. But the knowledge, the legitimacy of that whole world were not for her ... But if the aria were in Sarah's range she could bring something to it that a classically trained singer could not.\\"Gourse 2001, p. 246. In a chapter devoted to Vaughan in his book Visions of Jazz (2000), critic Gary Giddins described her as the \\"...ageless voice of modern jazz ‚Äì of giddy postwar virtuosity, biting wit and fearless caprice\\". He concluded by saying that \\"No matter how closely we dissect the particulars of her talent ... we must inevitably end up contemplating in silent awe the most phenomenal of her attributes, the one she was handed at birth, the voice that happens once in a lifetime, perhaps once in several lifetimes.\\" Her obituary in The New York Times described her as a \\"singer who brought an operatic splendor to her performances of popular standards and jazz.\\" Jazz singer Mel Torm√© said that she had \\"...the single best vocal instrument of any singer working in the popular field.\\" Her ability was envied by Frank Sinatra who said, \\"Sassy is so good now that when I listen to her I want to cut my wrists with a dull razor.\\" New York Times critic John S. Wilson said in 1957 that she possessed \\"what may well be the finest voice ever applied to jazz.\\" It was close to its peak until shortly before her death at the age of 66. Late in life she retained a \\"youthful suppleness and remarkably luscious timbre\\" and was capable of the projection of coloratura passages described as \\"delicate and ringingly high\\". Vaughan had a large vocal range of soprano through a female baritone, exceptional body, volume, a variety of vocal textures, and superb and highly personal vocal control. Her ear and sense of pitch were almost perfect, and there were no difficult intervals. In her later years her voice was described as a \\"burnished contralto\\" and as her voice deepened with age her lower register was described as having \\"shades from a gruff baritone into a rich, juicy contralto\\". Her use of her contralto register was likened to \\"dipping into a deep, mysterious well to scoop up a trove of buried riches.\\" Musicologist Henry Pleasants noted, \\"Vaughan who sings easily down to a contralto low D, ascends to a pure and accurate [soprano] high C.\\" Vaughan's vibrato was described as \\"an ornament of uniquely flexible size, shape and duration,\\" a vibrato described as \\"voluptuous\\" and \\"heavy\\" Vaughan was accomplished in her ability to \\"fray\\" or \\"bend\\" notes at the extremities of her vocal range. It was noted in a 1972 performance of Leslie Bricusse and Lionel Bart's \\"Where Is Love?\\" that \\"In mid-tune she began twisting the song, swinging from the incredible cello tones of her bottom register, skyrocketing to the wispy pianissimos of her top.\\" She held a microphone in live performance, using its placement as part of her performance. Her placings of the microphone allowed her to complement her volume and vocal texture, often holding the microphone at arm's length and moving it to alter her volume. She frequently used the song \\"Send in the Clowns\\" to demonstrate her vocal abilities in live performance. The performance was called a \\"three-octave tour de force of semi-improvisational pyrotechnics in which the jazz, pop and operatic sides of her musical personality came together and found complete expression\\" by The New York Times. Singers influenced by Vaughan include Phoebe Snow, Anita Baker, Sade, and Rickie Lee Jones. Singers Carmen McRae and Dianne Reeves both recorded tribute albums to Vaughan following her death; Sarah: Dedicated to You (1991) and The Calling: Celebrating Sarah Vaughan (2001) respectively. Though usually considered a jazz singer, Vaughan avoided classifying herself as one. She discussed the term in a 1982 interview for Down Beat: > I don't know why people call me a jazz singer, though I guess people > associate me with jazz because I was raised in it, from way back. I'm not > putting jazz down, but I'm not a jazz singer ... I've recorded all kinds of > music, but (to them) I'm either a jazz singer or a blues singer. I can't > sing a blues ‚Äì just a right-out blues ‚Äì but I can put the blues in whatever > I sing. I might sing 'Send In the Clowns' and I might stick a little bluesy > part in it, or any song. What I want to do, music-wise, is all kinds of > music that I like, and I like all kinds of music. Personal life Vaughan was married three times: to George Treadwell (1946‚Äì1958), to Clyde Atkins (1958‚Äì1961), and to Waymon Reed (1978‚Äì1981). Unable to bear children, Vaughan adopted a baby girl (Debra Lois) in 1961. Debra worked in the 1980s and 1990s as an actress under the name Paris Vaughan.Paris Vaughan In 1977, Vaughan ended her personal and professional relationship with Marshall Fisher. Although Fisher is occasionally referenced as Vaughan's third husband, they were never legally married. Vaughan began a relationship with Waymon Reed, a trumpet player 16 years her junior who was playing with the Count Basie band. Reed joined her working trio as a musical director and trumpet player, and became her third husband in 1978. She was a member of the Zeta Phi Beta sorority. Awards and honors The album Sarah Vaughan with Clifford Brown and the single \\"If You Could See Me Now\\" were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and have \\"qualitative or historical significance.\\" In 1985 she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and in 1988 she was inducted into the American Jazz Hall of Fame. In 1978, she was given an Honorary Doctorate of Music by Berklee College of Music. In 2012, she was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In 2004‚Äì2006, New Jersey Transit paid tribute to Vaughan in the design of its Newark Light Rail stations. Passengers stopping at any station on this line can read the lyrics to \\"Body and Soul\\" along the edge of the station platform. She was given the George and Ira Gershwin Award for Lifetime Musical Achievement at the UCLA Spring Sing. San Francisco and Berkeley, California, made March 27 Sarah Lois Vaughan Day.

Soxx & the Blue Jeans was an early 1960s vocal group produced by Phil Spector, and was initially conceived as a vehicle for the lead vocals of Bobby Sheen, who took the stage name Bob B. Soxx. The Blue Jeans were backing vocalists Darlene Love and Fanita James, both of whom were also members of the girl group the Blossoms. Career Despite Sheen's status as group leader, by the time the trio entered the recording studio, Spector was often using Love as the group's primary vocalist. Sheen sang lead on the group's first hit, 1962's \\"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\\" (originally from the 1946 Disney movie, Song of the South). Love, meanwhile, handled the lead vocals on the follow-up single, 1963's \\"Why Do Lovers Break Each Other's Heart\\". Sheen and Love shared lead vocal duties on the final single, \\"Not Too Young to Get Married\\". Sheen and Love shared vocal duties on the only album the group ever recorded, Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah (1963). Sheen can be heard as lead vocalist on the group's final recordings, \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\" and \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", two tracks on the Spector-produced album, A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector (1963), on which Love also appears as a solo artist. On the cover of this album, a group portrait shows Sheen with two Blue Jeans vocalists (actually two more Spector session singers, Lillian Washington and future Honey Cone member Carolyn Willis, who toured with Sheen as the Blue Jeans, although both Love and James continued as the Blue Jeans in the recording studio). After 1963, the group was dropped by Philles Records and effectively ceased to exist. Sheen went back to using his real name, recorded some tracks for Capitol Records in the mid 1960s, and later joined a touring version of the Coasters, which featured original bass singer Bobby Nunn. Sheen had previously been a member of the Robins, joining in 1957. Love recorded a few solo hits, but, more memorably, was the lead vocalist on at least two hit records by the Crystals. It is also established that Sheen, Love, and James (with the rest of the Blossoms) were the voices on the Crystals' hits \\"He's a Rebel\\" and \\"He's Sure the Boy I Love\\".

Henry II (13 January 1334 ‚Äì 29 May 1379), called Henry of Trast√°mara or the Fratricidal (el Fratricida), was the first King of Castile and Le√≥n from the House of Trast√°mara. He became king in 1369 by defeating his half-brother, Peter the Cruel, after numerous rebellions and battles. As king he was involved in the Fernandine Wars and the Hundred Years' War.  Biography  Henry was the fourth of ten illegitimate children of King Alfonso XI of Castile and Eleanor de Guzm√°n, a great-granddaughter of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n. He was born a twin to Fadrique Alfonso, Lord of Haro, and was the first boy born to the couple that survived to adulthood. At birth, he was adopted by Rodrigo √Ålvarez de las Asturias. Rodrigo died the following year and Henry inherited his lordship of Nore√±a. His father later made him Count of Trast√°mara and lord over Lemos and Sarria in Galicia, and the towns of Cabrera and Ribera, which constituted a large and important heritage in the northeast of the peninsula. It made him the head of the new Trast√°mara dynasty, arising from the main branch of Burgundy-Ivrea. While Alfonso XI lived, his lover Eleanor gave a great many titles and privileges to their sons. This caused discontent among many of the noblemen and in particular the queen, Maria of Portugal, and her son, Pedro, known as Pedro the Cruel and the Just. They had a chance for revenge when Alfonso XI died unexpectedly from a fever in the siege of Gibraltar in March, 1350. They pushed Eleanor, her sons and their supporters aside, and Henry and his brothers fled and scattered. They were fearful of what their brother, the new king Pedro I of Castile, could do to them. The late king had not even been buried. Although Eleanor and her sons reached an agreement with Pedro to live peacefully in his court, the situation remained unstable. Henry and his brothers Fadrique, Tello and Sancho staged numerous rebellions against the new king. Also, to strengthen his position and gain allies, Henry married Juana Manuel, the daughter of Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, adelantado mayor of Murcia and Lord of Villena, the most prosperous nobleman of the realm. In 1351, the King took counsel from Juan Alfonso de Alburquerque, Mar√≠a of Portugal's right-hand man. He became convinced that his father's lover was the instigator of the uprisings, so he ordered Eleanor to be incarcerated and finally executed in Talavera de la Reina. After that, Henry fled to Portugal. He was pardoned by Pedro and returned to Castile, then revolted in Asturias in 1352. He reconciled with his brother, only to rebel against him again in a long, intermittent war, which ended with Henry's flight to France, where he entered the service of John II of France. Shortly after, Henry and his men spent time in Peter IV of Aragon's army in their war against Castile (1358). During that conflict, he was defeated and held prisoner in N√°jera (1360). He was liberated (with the help of Juan Ram√≠rez de Arellano, among others) and exiled himself to France once more. Then Peter IV of Aragon attacked Castile again. Henry agreed to help him on condition that he would lend his support to destroying his brother, Pedro of Castile. This became the Castilian Civil War. The attack combined Henry's Castillian allies, the Aragonese and the French (a company of Bertrand du Guesclin's mercenaries, expelled by Pedro, who had taken refuge in Guyenne). Henry was proclaimed king in Calahorra (1366).Hume, Martin Andrew Sharp. The Spanish People, D. Appleton, 1911 In return, he had to reward his allies with titles and riches for the help they had provided. This earned him the nickname el de las mercedes (\\"mercedes being Spanish for \\"mercies\\"). Pedro of Castile fled north to Bordeaux, the capital of the English dominions in France, where Edward, the Black Prince held court. Edward agreed to help Pedro recover his throne. Despite the fact that the army suffered so badly from dysentery that it is said that one out of every five Englishmen would not return home,Green, David. \\"Masculinity and Medicine: Thomas Washington and the Death of the Black Prince.\\" Journal of Medieval History 35.1 (2009). 34-51 on 3 April 1367 an Anglo-Gascon army, led by Edward and his younger brother, John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, met the Castilian forces (supported by French mercenaries under Bertrand du Guesclin). Pedro then defeated Henry in the Battle of N√°jera, but Henry escaped and returned to France under the protection of Charles V of France. King Pedro and Prince Edward parted ways over the funding of the expedition, and the Black Prince returned to Bordeaux, having contracted an illness on this expedition that would ail him until his death in 1376. They reorganised their army at Peyrepertuse Castle. Then, with the help of many Castilian rebels and Bertrand du Guesclin's Frenchmen, they defeated Pedro at the Battle of Montiel on 14 March 1369. Henry killed \\"the Cruel King,\\" now a prisoner, with his own hand. This definitively won him the Castilian throne and the name of Henry II. Before being consolidated in his throne and being able to hand on power to his son John, Henry had to defeat Ferdinand I of Portugal. He embarked on the three Ferdinand Wars. Ferdinand's main ally in these wars was John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, the husband of Constance of Castile, Duchess of Lancaster, who was Pedro I's daughter. Henry was allied with Charles V of France. He put the Castilian navy at Charles' disposal and they played a key part in the siege of La Rochelle, and the Battle of La Rochelle where the admiral Ambrosio Boccanegra completely defeated the English side. Henry recompensed his allies, but he still had to defend his interests in the kingdom of Castile and Le√≥n. Consequently, he denied the King of Aragon the territories that he had promised him in the difficult times. Henry then went to war against Portugal and England in the Hundred Years' War. For most of his reign he had to fight off the attempts of John of Gaunt, a son of Edward III of England, to claim the Castilian throne in right of his second wife, Pedro's daughter, Infanta Constance of Castile. In his domestic policy he started to rebuild the kingdom, sped up the transformation of the royal administration; and held numerous courts. He also permanently set up the Lordship of Biscay after the death of his brother Tello. In foreign policy, he favoured France over England.  Policy regarding Jews  Henry was as hostile to the Jews as Pedro had been friendly.Abraham Zacuto (1452 ‚Äì circa 1515), in his book Sefer Yuchasin, Cracow 1580 (q.v. Sefer Yuchasin, p. 265 in PDF) makes mention that in the year 5130 anno mundi (corresponding with 1369/70 of our Common Era) there was a time of great disturbance all throughout the Jewish communities of Castille and ·π¨ulay·π≠ulah (Toledo) and that 38,000 Jews were killed in the ensuing wars between the two brothers, King Henry (Don Enrico) and King Peter (Don Pedro). In order to pay Bertrand du Guesclin's mercenaries, he imposed a war contribution of twenty thousand gold doubloons on the already heavily oppressed community of Toledo, and issued an order to take all the Jews of Toledo as prisoners, to give them neither food nor drink, and if they still refused to raise this enormous sum, to sell their property, both movable and immovable, at auction. Nonetheless, he was compelled, owing to his financial straits, to have recourse to Jewish financiers. He made Don Joseph Pichon his chief tax-collector (\\"contador major\\"), and appointed several Jews farmers of the taxes.\\"Henry II, or Henry de Trastamara\\", Jewish encyclopedia The demands of the Cortes in Toro (1369) and in Burgos (1374 and 1377) against the Jews harmonized perfectly with Henry's inclinations. He ordered the Jews to wear the humiliating badge, and forbade them to use Christian names. He further ordered that for short loans Christian debtors should repay only two-thirds of the principal. Shortly before his death Henry declared that Jews should no longer be permitted to hold public office. Henry was potentially the first ruler since the Visigothic King Ergica to implement anti-Jewish policies in the Iberian Peninsula. He died on 29 May 1379 in Santo Domingo de la Calzada. His son John I of Castile succeeded him on the throne.  Burial  The tomb of Henry II of Castile. After Henry's death, his body was transported to Burgos, then to Valladolid, then finally to Toledo where he was buried in Capilla de los Reyes Nuevos de Toledo His remains are still there today. His grave is in the choir stalls at one side of the church and it is in the Plateresque style. The box is adorned with the shields of Castille and Le√≥n, and the lower interior part has three panels decorated with trophies. There are two cherubs over the panels, holding the cartouche on which the king's epitaph is displayed. The inscription translates to: There is a recumbent statue of Henry II on top of the tomb. It is made from polychromed alabaster. It depicts the king wearing his royal robes, with his sword in his left hand and his girdle decorated with the lions of Castile. His right hand holds the sceptre, the upper end of which rests on three pillows that support the monarch's head. The king wears slippers and his feet rest on a recumbent lion. The king's entrails are buried in the Cathedral of Santo Domingo de la Calzada.  Partners and children  Statue of Henry II at the Royal Palace of Madrid.

Biography=Early military career= Terauchi was born in Tokyo Prefecture, and was the eldest son of Gensui Count Terauchi Masatake, the first Governor-General of Korea and the 9th Prime Minister of Japan. At the age of four, his father was transferred to France, and he was sent to live with his maternal aunt in Yamaguchi. Due to his family's close connections with former Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain, he was officially registered as a resident of Yamaguchi Prefecture around that time. After his father returned from an overseas assignment, the family moved back to Tokyo. He graduated from the 11th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1899, and served as a junior officer in the Russo-Japanese War with the Guards 2nd Infantry Battalion. After the war, Terauchi returned to the Army Staff College and graduated from the 21st class in 1909Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II. In July 1912, he was sent as a military attach√© to Austria-Hungary and in July 1914 to Germany. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1916 and attached to the IJA 2nd Infantry Regiment in September 1917. He worked as several administrative posts within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from September 1918. In early November 1919, he succeeded in the hereditary title of hakushaku (count) under the kazoku peerage system upon the death of his father, and was raised in military rank to colonel. In September 1920, he became commander of the 3rd Guards Infantry Battalion, and chief-of-staff of the Imperial Guard from September 1923. =As general= Terauchi was promoted to major general in February 1924 and was assigned to the staff of the IJA 1st Division in March 1926. In September 1926, the Sany≈ç Main Line train he was riding on derailed in an accident that killed 34 people, but Terauchi was not injured. In August 1927, Terauchi became Chief of Staff of the Chosen Army in Korea. He was promoted to lieutenant general in August 1929 and was assigned command of the Hiroshima- based IJA 5th Division. In January 1932, he was transferred to the Osaka-based IJA 4th Division. He was the leading military commander in Osaka during the notorious \\"Go-Stop Incident\\", in which the verbal altercation between two young men‚Äîan off-duty soldier in uniform who had ignored a traffic light and a policeman, which developed into fistfights, and finally into a ministerial- level conflict between the Home Ministry and the Army.Terauchi demanded an official apology from the Osaka police, insisting that the policeman had unfairly injured the Army's prestige.The Osaka police refused to apologize, stating that military personnel should also observe the law. However, the Home Ministry and the Army concluded later an agreement that precluded the civilian police from handling crimes committed by military personnel, which effectively placed military personnel above the law. In August 1934, Terauchi was transferred to command the Taiwan Army of Japan. He was promoted to full general in October 1935. =Military-political career= Field Marshal Shunroku Hata in Xuzhou, 1938 Terauchi was strongly associated with the K≈çd√µha faction in military politics Harries, Meirion (1994).

Random House; Reprint edition. and briefly served as interim Army Minister in March 1936 in the cabinet of Prime Minister Koki Hirota. His inflammatory rhetoric brought about the collapse of the Hirota administration in January 1937 when he engaged in a verbal shouting match against Speaker of the House Kunimatsu Hamada, accusing him of defaming the Army. Hamada retorted that he did not insult the Army, and would commit seppuku if it could be proven otherwise. On the other hand, Hamada said that Terauchi should commit seppuku himself if his accusation should be proven false. This clash further intensified the conflict between the military and the civilian political parties in the Japanese Diet. =World War II= In February 1937, Terauchi was appointed head of the Inspectorate General of Military Training, the third-most prestigious post in the military. With the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Terauchi was assigned combat duty and was given command of the North China Area Army in August 1937. He was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1938. Terauchi Hisaichi in Singapore, 1942 In November 1941, Terauchi was transferred to command of the Southern Expeditionary Army Group and soon afterward began coordinating war plans with Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for the Pacific War.Fuller, Shokan: Hirohito's Samurai After leading the conquest of Southeast Asia, Terauchi established his headquarters in Singapore. he received the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st class, in March 1942. Promoted to Gensui (Field Marshal) on 6 June 1943, he relocated to the Philippines in May 1944. When this area came under threat from the Allied attack, he retreated to Saigon in French Indochina. Soon after receiving word of the loss of Burma by Japan, he suffered a stroke on 10 May 1945. As the war in the Pacific drew to a close, a British Intelligence Liaison Officer, Major Richard Holbrook McGregor, was sent by General Mountbatten to Saigon to verify that Count Terauchi was indeed in a hospital and unable to make the flight to RAF Mingaladon Airfield to personally discuss terms of a cease-fire. Instead, the remaining 680,000 Japanese soldiers in Southeast Asia were surrendered on his behalf in Singapore on 12 September 1945 by General Seishir≈ç Itagaki. Terauchi personally surrendered to Mountbatten on 30 November 1945 in Saigon. On 12 June 1946, he suffered from another stroke at Renggam, Johor Bahru, Malaya while being transferred to a prisoner of war camp and died.Budge, The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia He was buried at the Japanese cemetery in Singapore. The 2nd Count Terauchi surrendered his family heirloom wakizashi short sword to the then Lord Louis Mountbatten in Saigon in 1945. The sword dates from 1413, and is now kept at Windsor Castle. It was almost the subject of a diplomatic incident in the mid-1980s, when Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother wanted to place it on prominent display during a dinner held for Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan. However, her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, vetoed the idea. Memorial to Terauchi in the Japanese Cemetery Park, Singapore War crimes Terauchi was given command of Southern Expeditionary Army, responsible for the opening Japanese offensive of the Pacific War. He was critical of Homma for being too 'soft' on Filipinos and of Imamura for granting too much power to the Indonesian puppet government.http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Boatner_1996 Terauchi's attitude likely played a role in Masaharu Homma's subsequent relief and retirement. Terauchi thought the army should stay out of politics, by which he probably meant that the politicians should keep their hands off the army. In other respects he was a typically ruthless Japanese Army officer. Neither the Americans nor his own peers thought much of him, but his staff were impressed by the fact that such a wealthy man chose to live so frugally. Yamashita felt otherwise, writing in his diary that \\"... that damn Terauchi lives in luxury in Saigon, sleeps in a comfortable bed, eats good food and plays shogi\\"http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Drea_2009 (Toland 1970) Yamashita added that: > \\"If there are two ways of doing something, trust Southern Army to pick the > wrong one.\\" When told that Terauchi was in too poor health to attend the surrender ceremony at Singapore, Mountbatten sent his own doctor to examine Terauchi. The doctor confirmed his fragile health, and Mountbatten had him transferred to a bungalow in Malaya in March 1946. On 11 June 1946, Terauchi became angered by a report of a Kempeitai lieutenant colonel who had threatened to disclose Japanese war crimes to the Allies, and he suffered a second massive stroke and died early the next morning. As a consequence, he never stood trial for war crimes, such as his responsibility for mistreatment of laborers on the Burma-Siam Railroad and his order that all Allied prisoners of war in his command area were to be massacred if Japan was invaded.http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/Bibliography.htm#Hayashi_Cox_1959_Kogun NotesReferences  External links  - Category:1879 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Yamaguchi Prefecture Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Japan Category:Japanese generals Category:Japanese military personnel of the Russo-Japanese War Category:People of the Second Sino-Japanese War Category:Japanese military personnel of World War II Category:Kazoku Category:Marshals of Japan Category:Ministers of the Imperial Japanese Army Category:World War II prisoners of war held by the United Kingdom Category:Japanese people who died in prison custody Category:Grand Cordons of the Order of the Rising Sun Category:Recipients of the Order of the Golden Kite, 1st class ","title":"Hisaichi Terauchi"},{"id":"167071","text":"Lawrence Kohlberg (; October 25, 1927 ‚Äì January 19, 1987) was an American psychologist best known for his theory of stages of moral development. He served as a professor in the Psychology Department at the University of Chicago and at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. Even though it was considered unusual in his era, he decided to study the topic of moral judgment, extending Jean Piaget's account of children's moral development from twenty-five years earlier. In fact, it took Kohlberg five years before he was able to publish an article based on his views. Kohlberg's work reflected and extended not only Piaget's findings but also the theories of philosophers George Herbert Mead and James Mark Baldwin.See Kohlberg, L. (1982), \\"Moral development,\\" in J.M. Broughton & D.J. Freeman-Moir (Eds.), The Cognitive Developmental Psychology of James Mark Baldwin: Current Theory and Research in Genetic Epistemology, Norwood, NJ: Ablex Publishing Corp. At the same time he was creating a new field within psychology: \\"moral development\\". In an empirical study using six criteria, such as citations and recognition, Kohlberg was found to be the 30th most eminent psychologist of the 20th century.Haggbloom, S.J. et al. (2002). The 100 Most Eminent Psychologists of the 20th Century. Review of General Psychology. Vol. 6, No. 2, 139‚Äì15. Haggbloom et al. combined three quantitative variables: citations in professional journals, citations in textbooks, and nominations in a survey given to members of the Association for Psychological Science, with three qualitative variables (converted to quantitative scores): National Academy of Science (NAS) membership, American Psychological Association (APA) President and/or recipient of the APA Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award, and surname used as an eponym. Then the list was rank ordered. Early life Lawrence Kohlberg was born in Bronxville, New York.See Fowler, J.W., Snarey, J., and DeNicola, K.

His parents separated when he was four years old and divorced finally when he was fourteen. From 1933 to 1938, Lawrence and his three other siblings rotated between their mother and father for six months at a time. In 1938 this rotating custody of the Kohlberg children was ended, allowing the children to choose the parent with whom they wanted to live. Kohlberg attended high school at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, which was an elite preparatory school. Kohlberg served in the Merchant Marine at the end of World War II.See Kohlberg, L. (1991), \\"My Personal Search for Universal Morality,\\" in L. Kuhmerker (Ed.), The Kohlberg Legacy for the Helping Professions, Birmingham, AL: R.E.P. Books. He worked for a time with the Haganah on a ship smuggling Jewish refugees from Romania through the British Blockade, into Palestine.Kohlberg, Laurence, \\"Beds for Bananas,\\" The Menorah Journal, Autumn 1948, pp. 385‚Äì399.Rudolph W. Patzert, Running the Palestine Blockade, Airlife Publishing: Shrewsbury, England, 1994. Captured by the British and held at an internment camp on Cyprus, Kohlberg escaped with fellow crew members. Kohlberg was in Palestine during the fighting in 1948 to establish the state of Israel, but refused to participate and focused on nonviolent forms of activism. He also lived in an Israeli kibbutz during this time, until he was able to return to America in 1948. In the same year he enrolled at the University of Chicago. At this time at Chicago it was possible to gain credit for courses by examination, and Kohlberg earned his bachelor's degree in one year, 1948. He then began study for his doctoral degree in psychology, which he completed at Chicago in 1958. In those early years he read Piaget's work. Kohlberg found a scholarly approach that gave a central place to the individual's reasoning in moral decision making. At the time this contrasted with the current psychological approaches of behaviorism and psychoanalysis that explained morality as simple internalization of external cultural or parental rules, through teaching using reinforcement and punishment or identification with a parental authority.Kohlberg, L. (1963). The development of children's orientations toward a moral order: I. Sequence in the development of moral thought. Vita Humana, 6(1‚Äì2), 11‚Äì33. Career Kohlberg's first academic appointment was at Yale University, as an assistant professor of psychology, 1958‚Äì1961. In 1955 while beginning his dissertation, he had married Lucille Stigberg, and the couple had two sons, David and Steven. Kohlberg spent a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences, in Palo Alto, California, 1961‚Äì1962, and then joined the Psychology Department of the University of Chicago as assistant, then associate professor of psychology and human development, 1962‚Äì1967. He held a visiting appointment at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, 1967‚Äì68, and then was appointed Professor of Education and Social Psychology there, beginning 1968, where he remained until his death. =Stages of moral development= In his unpublished 1958 dissertation, Kohlberg wrote what are now known as Kohlberg's stages of moral development. These stages are planes of moral adequacy conceived to explain the development of moral reasoning. Created while studying psychology at the University of Chicago, the theory was inspired by the work of Jean Piaget and a fascination with children's reactions to moral dilemmas. Kohlberg proposed a form of \\"Socratic\\" moral education and reaffirmed John Dewey's idea that development should be the aim of education. He also outlined how educators can influence moral development without indoctrination and how public school can be engaged in moral education consistent with the United States Constitution. Kohlberg's approach begins with the assumption that humans are intrinsically motivated to explore, and become competent at functioning in their environments. In social development, this leads us to imitate role models we perceive as competent and to look to them for validation.\\"Kohlberg, L. (1969), \\"Stage and sequence,\\" Handbook of Socialization Theory and Research, McGraw Hill: New York. Thus our earliest childhood references on the rightness of our and others' actions are adult role models with whom we are in regular contact. Kohlberg also held that there are common patterns of social life, observed in universally occurring social institutions, such as families, peer groups, structures and procedures for clan or society decision-making, and cooperative work for mutual defense and sustenance. Endeavoring to become competent participants in such institutions, humans in all cultures exhibit similar patterns of action and thought concerning the relations of self, others, and social world. Furthermore, the more one is prompted to imagine how others experience things and imaginatively to take their roles, the more quickly one learns to function well in cooperative human interactions. The sequence of stages of moral development thus corresponds to a sequence of progressively more inclusive social circles (family, peers, community, etc.), within which humans seek to operate competently. When those groups function well, oriented by reciprocity and mutual care and respect, growing humans adapt to larger and larger circles of justice, care, and respect. Each stage of moral cognitive development is the realization in conscious thought of the relations of justice, care, and respect exhibited in a wider circle of social relations, including narrower circles within the wider. Kohlberg's theory holds that moral reasoning, which is the basis for ethical behavior, has six identifiable developmental constructive stages ‚Äì each more adequate at responding to moral dilemmas than the last. Kohlberg suggested that the higher stages of moral development provide the person with greater capacities/abilities in terms of decision making and so these stages allow people to handle more complex dilemmas. In studying these, Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgment beyond the ages originally studied earlier by Piaget, who also claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages. Expanding considerably upon this groundwork, it was determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice and that its development continued throughout the life span, even spawning dialogue of philosophical implications of such research. His model \\"is based on the assumption of co- operative social organization on the basis of justice and fairness.\\" Kohlberg studied moral reasoning by presenting subjects with moral dilemmas. He would then categorize and classify the reasoning used in the responses, into one of six distinct stages, grouped into three levels: pre-conventional, conventional and post-conventional. Each level contains two stages. These stages heavily influenced others and have been utilized by others like James Rest in making the Defining Issues Test in 1979. = Moral education = Kohlberg is most well known among psychologists for his research in moral psychology, but among educators he is known for his applied work of moral education in schools. The three major contributions Kohlberg made to moral education were the use of Moral Exemplars, Dilemma Discussions, and Just Community Schools.Snarey, J. R. (2012). Lawrence Kohlberg: Moral biography, moral psychology, and moral pedagogy. In W.E. Pickren, D. A. Dewsbury, M. Wertheimer, W. E. Pickren, D. A. Dewsbury, M.

Kohlberg's first method of moral education was to examine the lives of moral exemplars who practiced principled morals such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Socrates, and Abraham Lincoln. He believed that moral exemplars' words and deeds increased the moral reasoning of those who watched and listened to them. Kohlberg never tested to see if examining the lives of moral exemplars did in fact increase moral reasoning. Recent research in moral psychology has brought back the value of witnessing moral exemplars in action or learning about their stories.Algoe, S. B., & Haidt, J. (2009). Witnessing excellence in action: The 'other-praising' emotions of elevation, gratitude, and admiration. The Journal of Positive Psychology, 4(2),105‚Äì127. doi:10.1080/17439760802650519 Witnessing the virtuous acts of moral exemplars may not increase moral reasoning, but it has been shown to elicit an emotion known as moral elevation that can increase an individual's desire to be a better person and even has the potential to increase prosocial and moral behavior.Aquino, K., McFerran, B., & Laven, M. (2011). Moral identity and the experience of moral elevation in response to acts of uncommon goodness.

Emotion, 8(2), 291‚Äì295. doi:10.1037/1528-3542.8.2.291 Although Kohlberg's hypothesis that moral exemplars could increase moral reasoning might be unfounded, his understanding that moral exemplars have an important place in moral education has growing support. Dilemma discussions in schools was another method proposed by Kohlberg to increase moral reasoning. Unlike moral exemplars, Kohlberg tested this method by integrating moral dilemma discussion into the curricula of school classes in humanities and social studies. Results of this and other studies using similar methods found that moral discussion does increase moral reasoning and works best if the individual in question is in discussion with a person who is using reasoning that is just one stage above their own. The final method Kohlberg used for moral education was known as \\"just communities\\". In 1974, Kohlberg worked with schools to set up democracy-based programs, where both students and teachers were given one vote to decide on school policies. The purpose of these programs were to build a sense of community in schools in order to promote democratic values and increase moral reasoning. Kohlberg's idea and development of \\"just communities\\" were greatly influenced by his time living in an Israeli kibbutz when he was a young adult in 1948 and when he was doing longitudinal cross-cultural research of moral development in another Israeli kibbutz.Snarey, J. R., Reimer, J., & Kohlberg, L. (1985). Development of social-moral reasoning among Kibbutz adolescents: A longitudinal cross-cultural study. Developmental Psychology, 21(1), 3‚Äì17. doi:10.1037/0012-1649.21.1.3 =Writing= Some of Kohlberg's most important publications were collected in his Essays on Moral Development, Vols. I and II, The Philosophy of Moral Development (1981) and The Psychology of Moral Development (1984), published by Harper & Row. Other works published by Kohlgainz or about Kohlberg's theories and research include Consensus and Controversy, The Meaning and Measurement of Moral Development, Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education and Child Psychology and Childhood Education: A Cognitive Developmental View. Critiques Carol Gilligan, a fellow researcher of Kohlberg's in the studies of moral reasoning that led to Kohlberg's developmental stage theory, suggested that to make moral judgments based on optimizing concrete human relations is not necessarily a lower stage of moral judgment than to consider objective principles. Postulating that women may develop an empathy-based ethic with a different, but not lower structure than that Kohlberg had described, Gilligan wrote In a Different Voice, a book that founded a new movement of care-based ethics that initially found strong resonance among feminists and later achieved wider recognition. Kohlberg's response to Carol Gilligan's criticism was that he agreed with her that there is a care moral orientation that is distinct from a justice moral orientation, but he disagreed with her claim that women scored lower than men on measures of moral developmental stages because they are more inclined to use care orientation rather than a justice orientation. Kohlberg disagreed with Gilligan's position on two grounds. First, many studies measuring moral development of males and females found no difference between men and women and when differences were found it was attributable to differences in education, work experiences, and role-taking opportunities, but not gender. Second, longitudinal studies of females found the same invariant sequence of moral development as previous studies that were of just males. In other words, Gilligan's criticism of Kohlberg's moral development theory was centered on differences between males and females that did not exist. Kohlberg's detailed responses to numerous critics can be read in his book Essays on Moral Development: Vol.II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages. Another criticism against Kohlberg's theory was that it focused too much on reason at the expense of other factors. One problem with Kohlberg's focus on reason was that little empirical evidence found a relationship between moral reasoning and moral behavior. Kohlberg recognized this lack of a relationship between his moral stages and moral behavior. In an attempt to understand this, he proposed two sub-stages within each stage, to explain individual differences within each stage.Kohlberg, L. (1984). Essays on Moral Development: Vol .II. The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages. San Francisco, Harper & Row He then proposed a model of the relationship between moral judgments and moral action. According to Kohlberg, an individual first interprets the situation using their moral reasoning, which is influenced by their moral stage and sub-stage. After interpretation individuals make a deontic choice and a judgment of responsibility, which are both influenced by the stage and sub-stage of the individual. If the individual does decide on a moral action and their obligation to do it, they still need the non-moral skills to carry out a moral behavior. If this model is true then it would explain why research was having a hard time finding a direct relationship between moral reason and moral behavior. Another problem with Kohlberg's emphasis on moral reasoning is growing empirical support that individuals are more likely to use intuitive \\"gut reactions\\" to make moral decisions than use reason-based thought.Arnold, M. L. (2000). Stage, Sequence, and Sequels: Changing Conceptions of Morality, Post-Kohlberg. Educational Psychology Review, 12(4), 365‚Äì383. The high use of intuition directly challenges the place of reason in moral experience. This expanding of the moral domain from reason has raised questions that perhaps morality research is entering areas of inquiry that are not considered real morality, which was a concern of Kohlberg when he first started his research. Scholars such as Elliot Turiel and James Rest have responded to Kohlberg's work with their own significant contributions. Death While doing cross- cultural research in Belize in 1971, Kohlberg contracted a parasitic infection. Due to this, he suffered from extreme abdominal pain. The long-term effects of the infection and the medications took their toll, and Kohlberg's health declined as he also engaged in increasingly demanding professional work, including \\"Just Community\\" prison and school moral education programs.Power, F.C., Higgins, A., and Kohlberg, L, Lawrence Kohlberg's Approach to Moral Education, New York, NY: Columbia University Press. Kohlberg sometimes experienced depression as well. On January 19, 1987, Kohlberg parked at the end of a dead end street in Winthrop, Massachusetts, across from Boston's Logan Airport. He left his wallet with identification on the front seat of his unlocked car and apparently walked into the icy Boston Harbor. His car and wallet were found within a couple of weeks, and his body was recovered some time later, with the late winter thaw, in a tidal marsh across the harbor near the end of a Logan Airport runway.Walsh, Catherine (2000). \\"The Life and Legacy of Lawrence Kohlberg\\", Society 37(2): 38‚Äì41. After Kohlberg's body was recovered and his death confirmed, former students and colleagues published special issues of scholarly journals to commemorate his contribution to developmental psychology.See, for instance, Boyd, D.

The element of umami, one of the five basic tastes, is introduced into dashi from the use of katsuobushi and kombu. Katsuobushi is especially high in sodium inosinate and kombu is especially high in glutamic acids; both combined create a synergy of umami.

The name corresponds to the Greek spelling Iesous (·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ), from which, through the Latin Iesus, comes the English spelling Jesus. The Hebrew spelling Yeshua () appears in some later books of the Hebrew Bible. Once for Joshua the son of Nun, and 28 times for Joshua the High Priest and other priests called Jeshua ‚Äì although these same priests are also given the spelling Joshua in 11 further instances in the books of Haggai and Zechariah. It differs from the usual Hebrew Bible spelling of Joshua ( y'hoshua ø), found 218 times in the Hebrew Bible, in the absence of the consonant he and placement of the semivowel vav ◊ï after, not before, the consonant shin . It also differs from the Hebrew spelling Yeshu () which is found in Ben Yehuda's dictionary and used in most secular contexts in Modern Hebrew to refer to Jesus of Nazareth, although the Hebrew spelling Yeshua () is generally used in translations of the New Testament into HebrewFranz Delitzsch Hebrew New Testament, Matthew 1:1, BFBS 1877, Isaac Salkinsohn Hebrew New Testament Matthew 1:1, TBS 1891 and used by Hebrew-speaking Christians in Israel. The name Yeshua is also used in Israelite Hebrew historical texts to refer to other Joshuas recorded in Greek texts such as Jesus ben Ananias and Jesus ben Sira.Robert E. Van Voorst Jesus outside the New Testament 2000 p124 \\"This is likely an inference from the Talmud and other Jewish usage, where Jesus is called Yeshu, and other Jews with the same name are called by the fuller name Yehoshua, \\"Joshua\\"\\" In English, the name Yeshua is extensively used by followers of Messianic Judaism, whereas East Syriac Christian denominations use the name Isho in order to preserve the Aramaic name of Jesus. The 2004 film The Passion of the Christ, which was made in Aramaic, used Yeshua as the name of Jesus and is the most well known western Christian work to have done so. Etymology The Greek transliteration (') *jesu-os -> can stand for both Classical Biblical Hebrew Yehoshua (top two) and Late Biblical Hebrew Yeshua (bottom). This later form developed within Hebrew (not Aramaic).David Talshir, 'Rabbinic Hebrew as Reflected in Personal Names', Scripta Hierosylamitana vol. 37, Magnes Press, Hebrew University in Jerusalem, 1998:374ff. All three spelling variants occur in the Hebrew Bible, including when referring to the same person. During the Second Temple Period, Jews of Galilee tended to preserve the traditional spelling, keeping the <◊ï> letter for the in the first syllable, even adding another letter for the in the second syllable. However, Jews of Jerusalem tended to spell the name as they pronounced it, , contracting the spelling to ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢ without the letter. Later, Aramaic references to the Hebrew Bible adopted the contracted phonetic form of this Hebrew name as an Aramaic name. Yeshua in Hebrew is a verbal derivative from \\"to rescue\\", \\"to deliver\\".Brown Driver Briggs Brown-Driver- Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon; Hendrickson Publishers 1996 Among the Jews of the Second Temple Period, the Biblical Aramaic/Hebrew name Yeshua‚Äò was common: the Hebrew Bible mentions several individuals with this name ‚Äì while also using their full name Joshua. This name is a feature of biblical books written in the post-Exilic period (Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles) and was found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, though Haggai and Zechariah prefer the spelling Joshua. Strong's Concordance connects the name Yeshua\`, in the English form Jeshua (as used in multiple instances in Ezra, Nehemiah, and 1 and 2 Chronicles), with the verb \\"to deliver\\" (or, \\"to rescue\\"). It is often translated as \\"He saves,\\" to conform with : \\"She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins\\" (NASB).\\"The New Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers 1990) The name \\"Yeshua\\" (transliterated in the English Old Testament as Jeshua) is a late form of the Biblical Hebrew name Yehoshua (Joshua), and spelled with a waw in the second syllable. The Late Biblical Hebrew spellings for earlier names often contracted the theophoric element Yeho- to Yo-. Thus Yehochanan contracted to Yochanan.David Talmshir, \\"Rabbinic Hebrew as Reflected in Personal Names\\" in Scripta Hierosolymitana: Publications of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, vol. 37 (Jerusalem: Magnes Press: Hebrew University of Jerusalem 1998) The name ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢ occurs in the Hebrew of the Old Testament at verses Ezra 2:2, 2:6, 2:36, 2:40, 3:2, 3:8, 3:9, 3:10, 3:18, 4:3, 8:33; Nehemiah 3:19, 7:7, 7:11, 7:39, 7:43, 8:7, 8:17, 9:4, 9:5, 11:26, 12:1, 12:7, 12:8, 12:10, 12:24, 12:26; 1 Chronicles 24:11; and 2 Chronicles 31:15, and also in Aramaic at Ezra 5:2. In Nehemiah 8:17 this name refers to Joshua son of Nun, the successor of Moses, as leader of the Israelites. Note that in earlier English (where adaptations of names of Biblical figures were generally based on the Latin Vulgate forms), Yeshua was generally transcribed identically to \\"Jesus\\" in English. The name Yehoshua has the form of a compound of \\"Yeho-\\" and \\"shua\\": Yeho- is another form of Yahu, a theophoric element standing for the name of God ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (the Tetragrammaton YHWH, sometimes transcribed into English as Yahweh), and shua‚Äò is a noun meaning \\"a cry for help\\", \\"a saving cry\\",\\"\\", Ernest Klein, A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the Hebrew Language (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company 1987), where it means \\"a cry for help\\".\\"\\", William L. Holladay, A Concise Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament (Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing 1971), where it means \\"a cry for help\\".\\"\\", M. Jastrow, Dictionary of the Talmud reprinted (Jerusalem: Khorev 1990), where is explained by the verb \\"to cry for help\\", that is to say, a shout given when in need of rescue. Another explanation for the name Yehoshua is that it comes from the root yod- shin-‚Äòayin, meaning \\"to deliver, save, or rescue\\". According to the Book of Numbers verse 13:16, the name of Joshua, the son of Nun was originally Hoshea\` , and the name \\"Yehoshua\`\\" is usually spelled the same but with a yod added at the beginning. \\"Hoshea\`\\" certainly comes from the root , \\"yasha\\", yod- shin-\`ayin (in the Hif'il form the yod becomes a waw), and not from the word Sh√∫a ª (Jewish Encyclopedia.) In the 1st century, Philo of Alexandria, in a Greek exposition, offered this understanding of Moses‚Äôs reason for the name change of the biblical hero Jehoshua/Joshua son of Nun from Hoshea [similar to hoshia\` meaning \\"He rescued\\"] to Yehoshua in commemoration of his salvation: \\"And ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ refers to salvation of the Lord\\" [ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ or Iesous being the Greek form of the name] () (On the Change of Names 21.121). Similarly, the Septuagint renders Ben Sira as saying (in the Greek form of the name): \\"ŒôŒ∑œÉŒøœÖœÇ the son of Naue [Yehoshua Ben Nun] who according to his name became great unto [the] salvation/deliverance of his chosen ones\\" () (Ben Sira 46:1‚Äì2). However, Ben Sira originally wrote in Hebrew in the 2nd century BC, and the only extant Hebrew manuscript for this passage has \\"in his days\\" (), not \\"according to his name\\" (which would be in Hebrew), and thus does not comment on the name Yehoshua as connoting \\"deliverance\\": \\"Yehoshua Ben Nun, who was formed to be in his days a great deliverer for his chosen ones\\" (). The name Yeshua is a shortened version of the name Yehoshua or Joshua and is the literal Hebrew word for Salvation. Archaeological evidence Tal Ilan's Lexicon of Jewish Names in Late Antiquity (2002) includes for \\"Joshua\\" 85 examples of Hebrew Yeshua, 15 of Yehoshua, and 48 examples of Iesous in Greek inscriptions,\\" with only one Greek variant as Iesoua.Buried Hope Or Risen Savior: The Search for the Jesus Tomb 2008 p81 Charles Quarles ‚Äì 2008 \\"The distinction between the longer and shorter forms does not exist in Greek.

See transcription in Bauckham essay in Quarles. Apart from the \\"Yeshu... Yeshua ben Yosef\\" ossuary, the only other known evidence for the existence of a Yeshu form prior to the material related to Jesus in the Talmud, is a graffito which Joachim Jeremias identified in Bethesda in 1966, but which is now filled in.New Testament theology Joachim Jeremias ‚Äì 1977 \\"... 1965, 284‚Äì93: 285; a graffito which I found in the south wall of the southern pool at Bethesda, now covered in, also read [y\\\\fw ', see my: The Rediscovery of Bethesda, New Testament Archaeology Monograph No I, Louisville, Ky., 1966, ...\\" Pronunciation In ( ), the Hebrew letter Yod ◊ô is vocalized with the Hebrew vowel tsere (a 'long' e like the first syllable of \\"neighbor\\" but not diphthongized) rather than with a shva (as Y'shua) or segol (Yesh-shua). The final letter Ayin ◊¢ is (a rough, guttural sound not found in Greek or English), sometimes transcribed \\" \` \\" (Yeshua\`). The final represents the \\"patach genuvah\\" (\\"furtive\\" patach), indicating that the consonant \`ayin is pronounced after the a vowel, and the word's stress is moved to the middle syllable (the characteristics of the furtive patach can be seen in other words, such as ◊®◊ï◊ó 'spirit'). Thus it is pronounced in Modern Hebrew. The Hebrew name of Jesus of Nazareth is probably pronounced 'Yeshua', although this is uncertain and depends on the reconstruction of several ancient Hebrew dialects. Talshir suggests, even though Galileans tended to keep the traditional spelling for 'Yehoshua' ◊ô◊î◊ï◊©◊ï◊¢ with the letter Vav for , they still pronounced the name similarly to the Judeans, as 'Yeshua' , who tended to spell the name phonetically as ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢, perhaps reducing the name thus: > > , with the palatizing (via 'dissimilation') before the .Talshir 1998:374,376. Qimron describes the general linguistic environment of Hebrew dialects by the time of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The articulation of the (along with other guttural phonemes , , and , as well as approximants and ) weakened significantly.Elisha Qimron, The Hebrew Of The Dead Sea Scrolls, Scholars Press, Harvard Semitic Studies vol. 29, 1986:25. Thus Hebrew pronunciations became less stable when two successive vowels were no longer separated by a consonant . The speakers optionally either reduced the two vowels to a single vowel or oppositely expanded them to emphasize each vowel separately, sometimes forming a furtive glide in between, or .Qimron:26, 31‚Äì35. For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls spell the Hebrew word ◊®◊ê◊ï◊ô ('seen') variously, recording both pronunciations: reduced ◊®◊ê◊ï and expanded ◊®◊ê◊ï◊ê◊ô .Qimron:35. The Hebrew name 'Yehoshua' generally reduced to 'Yeshua', but an expanded 'Yehoshua' is possible, especially in Galilee whose traditional orthography possibly reflects this. Original name for Jesus The English name Jesus derives from the Late Latin name ', which transliterates the Koine Greek name '. In the Septuagint and other Greek-language Jewish texts, such as the writings of Josephus and Philo of Alexandria, ' is the standard Koine Greek form used to translate both of the Hebrew names: Yehoshua and Yeshua. Greek or Iƒìso√ªs is also used to represent the name of Joshua son of Nun in the New Testament passages Acts 7:45 and Hebrews 4:8. (It was even used in the Septuagint to translate the name Hoshea in one of the three verses where this referred to Joshua the son of Nun‚ÄîDeut. 32:44.) During the second Temple period (beginning 538 BC ‚Äì 70 AD), Yeshua first became a known form of the name Yehoshua. All occurrences of Yeshua in the Hebrew Bible are in I Chron. 24:11, II Chron. 31:15, Ezra, and Nehemiah where it is transliterated into English as Jeshua. Two of these men (Joshua the son of Nun and Joshua the High Priest) are mentioned in other books of the Hebrew Bible where they are instead called Yehoshua Price, James D. Yehoshua, Yeshua or Yeshu; Which one is the name of Jesus in Hebrew?, accessed March 6, 2006. (transliterated into English as Joshua). The earlier form Yehoshua did not disappear, however, and remained in use as well. In the post-exilic books, Joshua the son of Nun is called both Yeshua bin-Nun (Nehemiah 8:17) and Yehoshua (I Chronicles 7:27). The short form Yeshua was used for Jesus ben Sirach in Hebrew fragments of the Wisdom of Sirach. (Some concern remains over whether these fragments faithfully represent the original Hebrew text or are instead a later translation back into Hebrew.William Chomsky, Hebrew: The Eternal Language, Jewish Publication Society of America, 1957 p.140) The earlier form Yehoshua saw revived usage from the Hasmonean period onwards, although the name Yeshua is still found in letters from the time of the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132‚Äì135 AD). In the documentary The Lost Tomb of Jesus, archeologist Amos Kloner stated that the name Yeshua was then a popular form of the name Yehoshua and was \\"one of the common names in the time of the Second Temple.\\" In discussing whether it was remarkable to find a tomb with the name of Jesus (the particular ossuary in question bears the inscription \\"Yehuda bar Yeshua\\"), he pointed out that the name had been found 71 times in burial caves from that time period. Thus, both the full form Yehoshua and the abbreviated form Yeshua were in use during the Gospel period ‚Äì and in relation to the same person, as in the Hebrew Bible references to Yehoshua/Yeshua son of Nun, and Yehoshua/Yeshua the high priest in the days of Ezra. An argument in favor of the Hebrew reduced form Yeshua, as opposed to Yehoshua, is the West Syriac dialect in which the pronunciation is Yeshu\` . =East Syriac Isho ï= Yeshuu ï or Isho ï, the Syriac name of Jesus Aramaic and Classical Syriac render the pronunciation of the same letters as ' ' and ' ' . The Aramaic Bibles and the Peshitta Syriac preserve these same spellings. Current scholarly consensus posits that the NT texts were translated from the Greek, but this theory is not supported directly at least by the name for Jesus, which is not a simple transliteration of the Greek form as would otherwise be expected, as Greek did not have an \\"sh\\" sound, and substituted ; and likewise lacked and therefore omitted the final ‚Äòayin sound . Moreover, Eusebius (early fourth century) reports that Papius (early second century) reports that Jesus's disciple Matthew wrote a gospel \\"in the Hebrew language\\". (Note: Scholars typically argue the word \\"Hebrew\\" in the New Testament refers to Aramaic; however, others have attempted to refute this view.Buth, Randall, and Pierce, Chad. \\"Ebraisti in Ancient Texts: Does ·ºòŒ≤œÅŒ±œäœÉœÑŒØ ever Mean \\"Aramaic\\"?\\" Buth and Notley, ed., The Language Environment in First Century Judea. Brill, 2014.) The Aramaic of the Peshitta does not distinguish between Joshua and Jesus, and the Lexicon of William Jennings gives the same form ' for both names. The Hebrew final letter ayin ' is equivalent to final ' in Classical Syriac and East Syriac and West Syriac. It can be argued that the Aramaic speakers who used this name had a continual connection to the Aramaic-speakers in communities founded by the apostles and other students of Jesus, thus independently preserved his historical name Yeshuu ï and the Eastern dialectical Isho ï. Those churches following the East Syriac Rite still preserve the name Isho ï. Yeshua, Yehoshua, and Yeshu in the Talmud In the Talmud, only one reference is made to the spelling Yeshua, in verbatim quotation from the Hebrew Bible regarding Jeshua son of Jozadak (elsewhere called Joshua son of Josedech). The Talmud does refer to several people named Yehoshua from before (e.g. Joshua ben Perachyah) and after Jesus (e.g., Joshua ben Hananiah). In references to Jesus in the Talmud, however, where the name occurs, it is rendered Yeshu, which is a name reserved in Aramaic and Hebrew literature from the early medieval period until today, solely for Jesus of Nazareth, not for other Joshuas. Some scholars, such as Maier (1978), regard the two named \\"Yeshu\\" texts in the Talmud (Sanhedrin 43a and 107b) to be later amendments, and not original.J. Maier Jesus von Nazareth 1978. G. Theissen, Historical Jesus. 1998. R. Voorst Jesus outside the New Testament 2000 =Rabbinical commentary on the difference Yeshu/Yeshua= In general rabbinical sources use Yeshu, and this is the form to which some named references to Jesus in the Talmud as Yeshu occur in some manuscripts of the Babylonian Talmud, though some scholars, such as Maier (1978) have argued that the presence of the name Yeshu in these texts is a late interpolation. Some of the Hebrew sources referencing Yeshu include the Toledot Yeshu, Sefer Nestor ha-Komer, Jacob ben Reuben's Milhamoth ha- Shem, Sefer Nizzahon Yashan, Sefer Joseph Hamekane, the works of Ibn Shaprut, Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas, and Hasdai Crescas. The name Yeshu is unknown in archeological sources and inscriptions, except for one ossuary found in Israel which has an inscription where someone has started to write first Yeshu.. and then written Yeshua bar Yehosef beneath it.Brother of Jesus Hershel Shanks, Ben Witherington photo of the \\"Yeshu...

Leon Modena argues that it was Jesus himself who made his disciples remove the ayin, and that therefore they cannot now restore it.

Early life and career Dunn was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania, and grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. When he was nine, a boxcar ran over his left arm while playing at a local railway. He was told by doctors that his arm had to be either amputated or risk death. He declined an amputation, but his arm was left crippled from above the elbow and couldn't lift the arm above his neck.Montville: p. 32. In 1896 he played for Toronto in the Eastern League, and the following year he reached the major leagues as a pitcher for the Brooklyn Bridegrooms. He bounced around the majors for seven years, having one good season with the Bridegrooms in 1899, with a 23‚Äì13 record. When he wasn't playing, Dunn studied how the game worked from the sidelines.Montville: p. 33. He was also a third baseman and shortstop. After 1904, he pitched and managed in the minors for a few seasons, winning an International League pennant in 1905. In 1907, Dunn took over as manager of the Baltimore Orioles, a minor league club with no connection to the current major league team by that name. He bought the team on November 16, 1909 for $70,000. He allegedly received a $10,000 loan from Philadelphia Athletics owner/manager Connie Mack. He developed a minor league powerhouse by scouting and developing his own players. He allegedly signed players by how they looked instead of skill, sometimes never seeing a player play before offering a contract. Rise to fame Dunn first achieved renown in 1914 when his Orioles were running away with the league pennant but losing money at the box office because of a rival team in town from the new aspiring \\"third major league\\", the Federal League with its team of the Baltimore Terrapins (a local species of turtle and tasty cuisine dish and delicacy for the Chesapeake Bay region) at their new steel-beamed modern stadium of \\"Terrapin Park\\" across the street at Greenmount Avenue and 29th Street from his older \\"American League Park\\" of 1901 from the club's days in the beginnings of the \\"upstart\\" American League, in what became known as the \\"Federal League Wars\\". To make his payroll, Dunn had to move the team to Richmond, Virginia and sell off his star player, Babe Ruth, and 11 other players to the majors. He later said that selling Ruth was his biggest regret. Dunn was indirectly responsible for Ruth's famous nickname, with Ruth's teammates referring to him as \\"Dunn's $10,000 Babe\\" for the price he drew. The team moved back to Baltimore in 1916, and Dunn again put together a juggernaut, ultimately signing 10 more players who went on to have solid major league careers. The best of these was pitcher Lefty Grove, who went 109‚Äì36 as an Oriole between 1920 and 1924. By that time, Dunn's team was in the midst of winning seven straight International League championships, many by huge margins. In addition to Grove, Dunn discovered other quality major leaguers such as Jack Bentley, Ernie Shore, George Earnshaw, Dick Porter and Tommy Thomas. Dunn's team was regarded as the equal of many major league teams, and he kept them so by refusing to trade or sell players to the majors. It wasn't until the 1925 off-season, when the other, struggling teams in the League made an agreement with the majors on a set price for transferring players, that Dunn finally relented and began selling his stars for money. His team won one more league title in 1925 and then dropped back into the pack. Dunn ran the Orioles until his death from a heart attack in 1928.

Japan's indigenous culture originates primarily from the Yayoi people who settled in Japan between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. Yayoi culture spread to the main island of Honsh≈´, mixing with the native J≈çmon culture. Modern Japanese have an estimated 80% Yayoi and 20% J≈çmon ancestry. Japanese culture was influenced from ancient times to the Middle Ages primarily by multiple Chinese dynasties and to a lesser extent by other Asian countries. For example the Japanese language uses Chinese characters (kanji) for writing, but Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese. Since the Meiji period Japan has been primarily influenced by western countries. The inhabitants of Japan experienced a long period of relative isolation from the outside world for over 220 years during the Tokugawa shogunate until the arrival of the \\"Black Ships\\" and the Meiji period. Today, the culture of Japan stands as one of the leading and most prominent cultures around the world, mainly because of the global reach of its popular culture. Language Japanese is the official and primary language of Japan. Japanese has a lexically distinct pitch-accent system. Early Japanese is known largely on the basis of its state in the 8th century, when the three major works of Old Japanese were compiled. The earliest attestation of the Japanese language is in a Chinese document from 256 AD. The Japanese language has no genetic relationship with Chinese, belonging instead to a completely different family of languages known as the Japonic languages. Japanese is written with a combination of three scripts: kanji, hiragana and katakana. Chinese characters, or , are extensively used in Japanese writing as non-phonetic ideograms, imported from China to Japan in 50 AD; before that time, Japan had no system of writing. In the present day, there are a notable number of kanji in modern Japanese with a different meaning from the corresponding character used in modern Chinese. Modern Japanese also features far fewer simplified Chinese characters in comparison to modern Chinese; Japanese people typically use fewer kanji in general and use them mainly for nouns, adjective stems and verb stems. Both hiragana and katakana are phonetic syllabaries derived from the Chinese of the 5th century.Yookoso! An Invitation to Contemporary Japanese 1st edition McGraw- Hill, page 13 \\"Linguistic Note: The Origins of Hiragana and Katakana\\" Hiragana and katakana were developed from simplified kanji; hiragana emerged somewhere around the 9th century and was mainly used by women for informal language, with katakana mainly used by men for formal language. By the 10th century, both were commonly used by everyone. The Latin alphabet is often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when inputting Japanese into a computer. The Hindu-Arabic numerals are generally used for numbers, but traditional Sino-Japanese numerals are common. Religion entrance gate at Shrine, Kyoto Shinto and Buddhism are the primary religions of Japan, though a secular Christmas is widely celebrated, and minority Christian and Islamic communities exist. =Shinto= Shinto is an ethnic religion focusing on ceremonies and rituals. In Shinto, followers believe that ‚Äì Shinto deities or spirits ‚Äì are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains. Humans can also be considered to possess a . One of the goals of Shinto is to maintain a connection between humans, nature, and . The religion developed in Japan prior to the sixth century CE, after which point followers built shrines to worship . =Buddhism= Amida Buddha, Buddhism developed in India around the 6th and 4th centuries BCE and eventually spread through China and Korea. It arrived in Japan during the 6th century CE, where it was initially unpopular. Most Japanese people were unable to understand the difficult philosophical messages present in Buddhism; however, an appreciation for the religion's art is believed to have led to Buddhism later growing in popularity. Buddhism is concerned with the soul and life after death. In Buddhism, a person's status in society is considered unimportant, as every person eventually becomes ill, ages, dies, and is eventually reincarnated into a new life, a cycle known as ; the suffering people experience during life is considered to be one way for people to ensure a better future, with the ultimate goal of Buddhism being to escape the cycle of death and rebirth by attaining true insight. National character Cultural map of the world according to the World Values Survey, describing Japan as highest in the world in \\"Secular-Rational Values\\" The Japanese \\"national character\\" has been written about under the term , literally meaning \\"theories/discussions about the Japanese people\\" and referring to texts on matters that are normally the concerns of sociology, psychology, history, linguistics, and philosophy, but emphasizing the authors' assumptions or perceptions of Japanese exceptionalism; these are predominantly written in Japan by Japanese people,Peter N. Dale, The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness (London: Routledge, 1990; ), passim. though noted examples have also been written by foreign residents, journalists and even scholars. Literature Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, often written in Classical Chinese. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan. The Tale of Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu during the Heian period, is known worldwide as a unique Japanese literature. Since Japan reopened its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so. Visual arts  A page from the , the oldest anthology of classical Japanese poetry Japanese calligraphy, rendered using flowing, brush-drawn strokes, is considered to be a traditional art form, as well as a means of conveying written information. Typical calligraphic works can consist of phrases, poems, stories, or even characters represented by themselves; the style and format of the calligraphy can mimic the subject matter through aspects such as the texture of the writing and the speed of the brush strokes. Several different styles of Japanese calligraphy exist, with considerable effort put into the outcome; in some cases, it can take over one hundred attempts to produce the desired result of a single character. This form of calligraphy is known as , literally meaning 'the way of writing or calligraphy', or more commonly, , 'learning how to write characters'. Commonly confused with calligraphy is the art form of , literally meaning 'ink painting', which is the art of painting a scene or object using diluted black ink. Painting has been an art in Japan for a very long time: the brush is a traditional writing and painting tool, and the extension of that to its use as an artist's tool was probably natural. Japanese painters are often categorized by what they painted, as most of them constrained themselves solely to subjects such as animals, landscapes, or figures. Chinese papermaking was introduced to Japan around the 7th century. Later, was developed from it. Native Japanese painting techniques are still in use today, as well as techniques adopted from continental Asia and from the West. Schools of painting such as the school of the 16th century became known for their bold brush strokes and contrast between light and dark, especially after and began to use this style. Famous Japanese painters include , and . , literally \\"pictures of the floating world\\", is a genre of woodblock prints that exemplifies the characteristics of pre-Meiji Japanese art. Because these prints could be mass-produced, they were available to a wide cross-section of the Japanese populace ‚Äî those not wealthy enough to afford original paintings ‚Äî during their heyday, from the 17th to 20th century. is the Japanese art of flower arrangement. It has gained widespread international fame for its focus on harmony, color use, rhythm, and elegantly simple design. It is an art centered greatly on expressing the seasons and is meant to act as a symbol to something greater than the flower itself. Traditional clothing armor in 1860s The kimono is the national garment of Japan, having developed from Chinese court clothing in the Nara period (Tang dynasty China) following the exchange of diplomatic envoys between the two countries at that time. The word \\"kimono\\" translates literally as \\"thing to wear on the shoulders\\"; however, this term developed some time around the Edo period, before which most kimono- like garments were referred to as (lit., \\"short sleeve\\"), with longer-sleeved garments being known as (lit., \\"swinging sleeve\\"). The earliest versions of the kimono were heavily influenced by traditional Chinese clothing, known today as ( in Japanese). This influence was spread through Japanese envoy missions to China, resulting in extensive Chinese cultural adoption by Japan as early as the 5th century AD.Dalby, Liza (2001). Kimono: Fashioning Culture. Seattle: University of Washington Press. . OCLC 46793052. It was during the 8th century, however, that Chinese fashions came fully into style, and following the cancellation of the 20th mission to Tang dynasty China, these fashions developed independently, with the overlapping, V-shaped collar becoming women's fashion and the precusor to the modern kimono. Kimono, alongside all other items of traditional Japanese clothing, are known collectively as , meaning \\"Japanese clothing\\", as opposed to , Western-style clothing. Kimono come in a variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Men mainly wear darker or more muted colors, while women tend to wear brighter colors and pastels, and, especially for younger women, often with complicated abstract or floral patterns. Japanese suffragette wears a layered kimono in New York in 1917 In previous decades, married women wore short sleeved kimono, whereas unmarried women wore long sleeved kimono to both formal and informal occasions; however, the rise in both the average age of marriage and the numbers of women never marrying in Japan has led to the divide between sleeve length becoming one more of age, with most women in their early twenties wearing long sleeved kimono only to formal occasions, and most women past their early twenties wearing short sleeved kimono to formal events. Other developments include the abandoning of layered kimono and the standardisation of the length of short sleeved women's kimono to a range of roughly to in length, both developments driven by fabric shortages in WW2. The coat is another form of traditional clothing. A (commonly Westernised as \\"happy\\") coat is a straight sleeved coat typically decorated with a family crest and/or kanji along the collar. In previous centuries, were commonly worn by firefighters; the coats would be constructed from several layers of heavy cotton stitched together, and would be soaked in water to provide protection from fire. Alongside traditional clothing, Japan also has distinct footwear; , ankle-length split-toed socks, are commonly worn with the kimono, and are designed to be worn with traditional shoes such as and . are thonged sandals mounted on wooden blocks extending from the base of the shoe to the floor, and are worn by men and women with kimono or ; are flat base or sloping sandals made of a number of different materials, and are considered to be more formal than .

Examples of traditional architecture are seen at temples, Shinto shrines, and castles in Kyoto and Nara. Some of these buildings are constructed with traditional gardens, which are influenced by Zen ideas. Some modern architects, such as and are known for their amalgamation of Japanese traditional and Western architectural influences. Traditional Japanese garden architecture is considered to hold the same importance as traditional building architecture, and both are influenced by similar historical and religious backgrounds. A primary design principle of a traditional garden is the creation of the landscape based on, or at least greatly influenced by, the style of three- dimensional monochrome ink () landscape painting known as or ; as such, garden landscaping is elevated to the status of an artform in Japan. Traditional Japanese sculptures mainly focused on Buddhist images, such as Tathagata, Bodhisattva, and . The oldest sculpture in Japan is a wooden statue of at the temple. In the Nara period, Buddhist statues were made by the national government to boost its prestige. These examples are seen in present-day Nara and Kyoto, most notably a colossal bronze statue of the Buddha Vairocana in the temple. Wood has traditionally been used as the chief material in Japan, along with traditional Japanese architecture. Statues are often lacquered, gilded, or brightly painted, although there are commonly few traces of this on the surface. Bronze and other metals are generally not used. Other materials, such as stone and pottery, have had extremely important roles in traditional sculpture. File:Horyu-ji45s2s4500.jpg is widely known to be the oldest wooden architecture existing in the world. File:Ritsurin.JPGRitsurin Garden File:NaraTodaijiStatue0214.jpgGuardian in Music playing the (kabuki dance, Guimet Museum, Paris) The music of Japan includes a wide array of performers in distinct styles both traditional and modern. The word for music in Japanese is , combining the kanji (\\"sound\\") with the kanji (\\"enjoyment\\").Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary, Japan is the second largest music market in the world behind the United States, and is the largest in Asia, with most of the market dominated by Japanese artists. Local music often appears at karaoke venues on lease from record labels. Traditional Japanese music is quite different from Western Music and is based on the intervals of human breathing rather than mathematical timing; traditional music also typically slides between notes, a feature also not commonly found in Western music. In 1873, a British traveler claimed that Japanese music \\"exasperate(s) beyond all endurance the European breast.\\"\\"News World news Germany Lost in translation\\" Performing arts Noh play at traditional Noh theatre The four traditional theatres from Japan are noh (or n≈ç), , kabuki, and . Noh had its origins in the union of the , with music and dance made by and . Among the characteristic aspects of it are the masks, costumes, and the stylized gestures, sometimes accompanied by a fan that can represent other objects. The noh programs are presented in alternation with the ones of , traditionally in number of five, but currently in groups of three. The , of a humorous character, had an older origin, in 8th-century entertainment brought from China, developing itself in . In , masks are rarely used and even if the plays can be associated with the ones of noh, currently many are not. Kabuki appears in the beginning of the Edo period from the representations and dances of in Kyoto. Due to concerns over the number of actresses engaged in selling sex, the participation of women in the plays was forbidden by the government in 1629, and the feminine characters had passed to be represented only by men (). Recent attempts to reintroduce actresses in kabuki had not been well accepted. Another characteristic of kabuki is the use of makeup for the actors in historical plays (). Japanese puppet theater () developed in the same period, that kabuki in a competition and contribution relation involving actors and authors. The origin of , however is older, lies back in the Heian period. In 1914, appeared the Takarazuka Revue a company solely composed by women who introduced the revue in Japan. Sports and leisure Two students practicing kendo at Hiroshima University In the long feudal period governed by the samurai class, some methods that were used to train warriors were developed into well-ordered martial arts, in modern times referred to collectively as . Examples include , and sumo, all of which were established in the Edo period. After the rapid social change in the Meiji Restoration, some martial arts changed into modern sports, called . Judo was developed by , who studied some sects of jujutsu. These sports are still widely practiced in present-day Japan and other countries. Baseball, Association football, and other popular western sports were imported to Japan in the Meiji period. These sports are commonly practiced in schools, along with traditional martial arts. Baseball, soccer, football, and ping pong are the most popular sports in Japan. Association football gained prominence in Japan after the J League (Japan Professional Football League) was established in 1991. Japan also co- hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup. In addition, there are many semi-professional organizations, which are sponsored by private companies: for example, volleyball, basketball, rugby union, table tennis, and so on. Cuisine Traditional breakfast at ryokan Through a long culinary past, the Japanese have developed sophisticated and refined cuisine. In more recent years, Japanese food has become fashionable and popular in the United States, Europe, and many other areas. Dishes such as sushi, tempura, noodles, and teriyaki are some of the foods that are commonly known. The Japanese diet consists principally of rice; fresh, lean seafood; and pickled or boiled vegetables. The healthy Japanese diet is often believed to be related to the longevity of Japanese people. Popular culture Japanese popular culture not only reflects the attitudes and concerns of the present day but also provides a link to the past. Popular films, television programs, manga, music, anime and video games all developed from older artistic and literary traditions, and many of their themes and styles of presentation can be traced to traditional art forms. Contemporary forms of popular culture, much like the traditional forms, provide not only entertainment but also an escape for the contemporary Japanese from the problems of an industrial world. Many anime and manga are very popular around the world and continue to become popular, as well as Japanese video games, fashion, and game shows.\\"Cool Japan: Why Japanese remakes are so popular on American TV, and where we‚Äôre getting it wrong\\" . AsianWeek. Retrieved on 2008-09-16. In the late 1980s, the family was the focus of leisure activities, such as excursions to parks or shopping districts. Although Japan is often thought of as a hard-working society with little time for leisure, the Japanese seek entertainment wherever they can. It is common to see Japanese commuters riding the train to work, enjoying their favorite manga, or listening through earphones to the latest in popular music. A wide variety of types of popular entertainment are available. There is a large selection of music, films, and the products of a huge manga and anime industry, among other forms of entertainment, from which to choose. Game centers, bowling alleys, and karaoke are popular hangout places for teens while older people may play shogi or go in specialized parlors. Together, the publishing, film/video, music/audio, and game industries in Japan make up the growing Japanese content industry. Cultural landscapes There are 51 official in Japan. These landscapes evolved with the way of life and geocultural features of a region, and which are indispensable for understanding the lifestyle of the Japanese people. The is the canonical list of Japan's three most celebrated scenic sights, attributed to 1643 scholar Hayashi Gah≈ç. These are the pine-clad islands of Matsushima in Miyagi Prefecture, the pine-clad sandbar of Amanohashidate in Kyoto Prefecture, and Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima Prefecture.

Japan is regarded as the most eastern Asian country, because east of Japan is the vast Pacific Ocean. is Japan's easternmost island. Thus Japan is the land where the sun rises before the Asian continent. The kanji that make up the name of Japan literally mean 'sun origin'. It is pronounced as or in Japanese. So it is often called by the epithet \\"Land of the Rising Sun\\". The (lit., the \\"sun-rise flag\\") is the national flag of Japan. It symbolizes the rising sun and corresponds with the name of Japan. The earliest accounts of the rising sun flag is in the 7th century CE. In 607, an official correspondence that began with \\"from the Emperor of the rising sun\\" was sent to Chinese Emperor Yang of Sui. Thus the central importance of the sun in Japanese culture is represented in the national flag and other cultural goods. Similarly, the Japan Self-Defense Forces have flags that symbolize the sun. The sun also plays an important role in Japanese mythology and religion as the emperor is said to be the direct descendant of the sun goddess , the personification of Japan. She is seen as the goddess of the sun and the universe in Shinto religion. The emperor is \\"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\\" Emperor Jimmu () is the national founder of Japan. The national animals are the Green pheasant, Koi fish and the Great purple emperor butterfly. The Imperial Seal of Japan is one of the national seals and a crest () used by the Emperor of Japan and members of the Imperial Family.

Note the unripe fruit on second-year side shoots in the background and late flowers (13 August 2017) from the tip- flowering of first-year growth. Pink blackberry flower, Wellington, New Zealand A bramble is any rough, tangled, prickly shrub, usually in the genus Rubus, which grows blackberries, raspberries, or dewberries. \\"Bramble\\" is also used to describe other prickly shrubs such as roses (Rosa species). Bramble or brambleberry sometimes refers to the blackberry fruit or products of its fruit, such as bramble jelly. In British English, bramble usually refers to the common blackberry, Rubus fruticosus. R. fruticosus grows abundantly in all parts of the British Isles and harvesting the fruits in late summer and autumn is often considered a favourite pastime. An especially hardy plant, bramble bushes can also become a nuisance in gardens, sending down strong suckering roots amongst hedges and shrubs and being particularly resilient against pruning. Many consider R. fruticosus a weed due its tendency to grow in neglected areas and its sharp, tough thorns which can be hazardous to children and pets.https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=256  Etymology  \\"Bramble\\" comes from Old English br√¶mbel, a variant of br√¶mel. It ultimately descends from Proto-Germanic *brƒìm-, whence come also English broom, German ', Dutch ' and French '.  Description  Bramble bushes have long, thorny, arching shoots and root easily. They send up long, arching canes that typically do not flower or set fruit until the second year of growth; some varieties, known as everbearing or primocane bearing produce fruit on the tips of first-year canes. Brambles usually have trifoliate or palmately-compound leaves. Bramble fruits are aggregate fruits. Each small unit is called a drupelet. In some, such as the blackberry, the flower receptacle is elongated and part of the ripe fruit, making the blackberry an aggregate-accessory fruit.  Uses  The blackberry is a bramble Many species are grown and bred for their fruit. Ornamental species can be grown for flowers (e.g. Rubus trilobus), for their ornamental stems (e.g. Rubus cockburnianus) and some as ground cover (e.g. Rubus tricolor). Members of the Rubus genus tend to have a brittle, porous core and an oily residue along the stalk which makes them ideal to burn, even in damp climates. The thorny varieties are sometimes grown for game cover and occasionally for protection. Most species are important for their conservation and wildlife value in their native range. The flowers attract nectar-feeding butterflies and hoverflies, and are a particular favourite of Volucella pellucens. Brambles are important food plants for the larvae of several species of Lepidoptera‚Äîsee list of Lepidoptera that feed on Rubus. The leaves of brambles are often used as a main food source for captive stick insects. Many birds, such as the common blackbird, and some mammals will feed on the nutritious fruits in autumn. Split bramble stems are traditionally used as binding material for straw in production of lip-work basketry, such as lip-work chairs and bee skeps and sometimes used to protect other fruits such as strawberries. Bramble leaves can be used to feed most Phasmatodea. Young leaves contain a toxin that can be harmful to many species of Phasmatodea, however this only occurs up until their third instar, by which time they have developed an immunity to it. = Control of common blackberry = Scything woodland brambles in Kent, England, preparatory to poisoning emerging new spring shoots Rubus fruticosus is difficult to eradicate once it has become established. Early action by hand pulling with a gloved hand and digging young seedlings as soon as they are seen will save a lot of hard work later. A thick mulch of chipped bark or compost will also make it much easier to pull out recently germinated seeds in the spring. Light but established infestations in friable, workable soils may be removed by cutting back the stems to about above the ground, to leave a handle, and forking out the bramble stump with as much of the root as possible. Anything left below-ground may regenerate. Heavy infestations may make the land completely impenetrable and will require cutting first just to access the stems. The root systems will also be so pervasive that removing them would require digging up the entire area; doing this in woodland areas will cause unacceptable damage to the surface roots of trees and to flowering bulbs and should be avoided. In this case, chemical control using a selective weedkiller such as triclopyr to wet the photosynthesising bramble leaves is very effective if applied in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. However, a heavily infested area of uncut brambles will require an inordinate amount of poison to wet the leaves; it is far cheaper, and more effective, to cut the area as close to ground level as possible in the spring, clear the debris into piles to reveal the ground surface and to accurately spot sprayhttps://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?PID=460 the shoots that will emerge two to three weeks later as soon as they have a small amount of new foliage. This will kill the plant back into its root system using a small fraction of the poison required to spray whole bushes. The area may first be cleared using a tractor-mounted rotary mower, motorised string trimmer or with a scythe. A short-bladed, , scythe in good hands can be faster than using a string trimmer, leaves a neater cut close to the ground, avoids collateral damage to other plants that are desirable to keep, and deposits the cut debris aligned in swathes that are easier to remove and stack. The area must be cut and cleared at some point anyway and it is easier to clear the debris while green and flexible than dead and dry, so clearing when green then spraying a little is more efficient than spraying a lot then clearing when dry. Triclopyr is highly selective: it only affects actively photosynthesising dicots, leaving grass, and flowering monocots such as narcissus and bluebell bulbs, undamaged. It also breaks down harmlessly in the soil within about six weeks leaving no toxic residuals.Environmental Fate Of Triclopyr , Carissa Ganapathy, Environmental Monitoring & Pest Management Branch Department of Pesticide Regulation Sacramento, CA Glyphosate is also effective but must be used with much greater care and will damage other woodland plants. = Cultivation = right There are many different systems developed for the commercial culture of blackberries and raspberries. Bramble cultivars are separated into several categories based on their growth habit. They are categorised as erect, semi- erect, or trailing. Plants bearing thorns, brambles, spines, or prickles are often used as a defence against burglary, being strategically planted below windows or around the entire perimeter of a property.Marcus Felson, Crime and Nature (2006), p. 288. They also have been used to protect crops and livestock against marauding animals. Examples include hawthorn hedges in Europe, Agaves in the Americas and in other countries where they have been introduced, Osage Orange in the prairie states of the US, and Sansevieria in Africa.Hunter, J.

Gravel is classified by particle size range and includes size classes from granule- to boulder-sized fragments. In the Udden-Wentworth scale gravel is categorized into granular gravel () and pebble gravel (). ISO 14688 grades gravels as fine, medium, and coarse with ranges 2 mm to 6.3 mm to 20 mm to 63 mm. One cubic metre of gravel typically weighs about 1,800 kg (or a cubic yard weighs about 3,000 pounds). Gravel is an important commercial product, with a number of applications. Many roadways are surfaced with gravel, especially in rural areas where there is little traffic. Globally, far more roads are surfaced with gravel than with concrete or asphalt; Russia alone has over of gravel roads. Both sand and small gravel are also important for the manufacture of concrete. Geological formation Large gravel deposits are a common geological feature, being formed as a result of the weathering and erosion of rocks. The action of rivers and waves tends to pile up gravel in large accumulations. This can sometimes result in gravel becoming compacted and lithified into the sedimentary rock called conglomerate. Where natural gravel deposits are insufficient for human purposes, gravel is often produced by quarrying and crushing hard-wearing rocks, such as sandstone, limestone, or basalt. Quarries where gravel is extracted are known as gravel pits. Southern England possesses particularly large concentrations of them due to the widespread deposition of gravel in the region during the Ice Ages. Gravel is a collection of rock fragments, which can range in size but are larger than sand. Gravel can be created naturally by the erosion of bigger rocks, or it is manufactured. Gravel is used in large construction projects, but it can also be ideal for replacing grass. It requires a lot less maintenance than grass and can look even better. Pea gravel costs about $30-35 per cubic yard, but different colored gravels can be more expensive. https://earthdevelopmentinc.com/blog/fill-dirt-vs-topsoil/ =Modern production= As of 2006, the United States is the world's leading producer and consumer of gravel.Mineral Commodity Summaries 2006 2009Industrial Sand And Gravel (Silica): World Production, By Country 2009 Etymology The word gravel comes from the Old French graveleCollins English Dictionary ‚Äì Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition.

Types Varieties of Gravel in different shapes and sizes. Gravel with stones sized roughly between 5 and 15 mm Types of gravel include: * Bank gravel: naturally deposited gravel intermixed with sand or clay found in and next to rivers and streams. Also known as \\"bank run\\" or \\"river run\\". * Bench gravel: a bed of gravel located on the side of a valley above the present stream bottom, indicating the former location of the stream bed when it was at a higher level. *Creek rock or river rock: this is generally rounded, semi-polished stones, potentially of a wide range of types, that are dredged or scooped from stream beds. It is also often used as concrete aggregate and less often as a paving surface. *Crushed stone: rock crushed and graded by screens and then mixed to a blend of stones and fines. It is widely used as a surfacing for roads and driveways, sometimes with tar applied over it. Crushed stone may be made from granite, limestone, dolomite, and other rocks. Also known as \\"crusher run\\", DGA (dense grade aggregate) QP (quarry process), and shoulder stone. * Fine gravel: gravel consisting of particles with a diameter of 2 to 8 mm. * Stone dust: fine, crushed, gravel from the final stage of screen separation, such that the gravel is not separated out from fine dust particles. * Lag gravel: a surface accumulation of coarse gravel produced by the removal of finer particles. * Pay gravel: also known as \\"pay dirt\\"; a nickname for gravel with a high concentration of gold and other precious metals. The metals are recovered through gold panning. * Pea gravel: also known as \\"pea shingle\\" is gravel that consists of small, rounded stones used in concrete surfaces. Also used for walkways, driveways and as a substrate in home aquariums. * Piedmont gravel: a coarse gravel carried down from high places by mountain streams and deposited on relatively flat ground, where the water runs more slowly. * Plateau gravel: a layer of gravel on a plateau or other region above the height at which stream-terrace gravel is usually found.

It is a procedure distinct from head transplantation, which involves transferring the entire head to a new body, as opposed to the brain only. Theoretically, a person with advanced organ failure could be given a new and functional body while keeping their own personality, memories, and consciousness through such a procedure. No human brain transplant has ever been conducted. Neurosurgeon Robert J. White has grafted the head of a monkey onto the headless body of another monkey. EEG readings showed the brain was later functioning normally. Initially, it was thought to prove that the brain was an immunologically privileged organ, as the host's immune system did not attack it at first, but immunorejection caused the monkey to die after nine days. Brain transplants and similar concepts have also been explored in various forms of science fiction.  Existing challenges  One of the most significant barriers to the procedure is the inability of nerve tissue to heal properly; scarred nerve tissue does not transmit signals well, which is why a spinal cord injury is so devastating. Research at the Wistar Institute of the University of Pennsylvania involving tissue-regenerating mice (known as MRL mice) may provide pointers for further research as to how to regenerate nerves without scarring. It is possible that a completely clean cut will not generate scarred tissue. Alternatively, a brain‚Äìcomputer interface can be used connecting the subject to their own body. A study using a monkey as a subject shows that it is possible to directly use commands from the brain, bypass the spinal cord and enable hand function. An advantage is that this interface can be adjusted after the surgical interventions are done where nerves can not be reconnected without surgery. Also, for the procedure to be practical, the age of the donated body must be sufficient: an adult brain cannot fit into a skull that has not reached its full growth, which occurs at age 9‚Äì12 years. When organs are transplanted, aggressive rejection by the host's immune system can occur. Because immune cells of the CNS contribute to the maintenance of neurogenesis and spatial learning abilities in adulthood, the brain has been hypothesized to be an immunologically privileged (unrejectable) organ.Mike Darwin: But What Will The Neighbors Think? A Discourse On The History And Rationale Of Neurosuspension. Cryonics, October 1988. However, immunorejection of a functional transplanted brain has been reported in monkeys.  Partial brain transplant  In 1982, Dr. Dorothy T. Krieger, chief of endocrinology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, achieved success with a partial brain transplant in mice. In 1998, a team of surgeons from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center attempted to transplant a group of brain cells to Alma Cerasini, who had suffered a severe stroke that caused the loss of mobility in her right limbs as well as limited speech. The team's hope was that the cells would correct the listed damage.  In science fiction  The whole-body transplant is just one of several means of putting a consciousness into a new body that have been explored in science fiction. In the film Get Out (2017), written and directed by Jordan Peele, a young, white woman, Rose Armitage (Allison Williams), lures her young, black boyfriend, Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya), to her family's estate to be auctioned-off for a brain transplant procedure that enables older, white residents of the Armitage community to obtain a pseudo-immortality in a black person's body. The Armitage family is the founder of the cult The Order of the Coagula, in which Missy Armitage (Catherine Keener), a psychiatrist, uses hypnosis to subdue the consciousness of black persons to The Sunken Place, and Dean Armitage (Bradley Whitford), a neurosurgeon, transplants the brain of the white person into the black person's body. Due to the human body's need for motor functions, only a partial brain transplant is possible. The Sunken Place is essential to suppressing the conscious minds of the hosts while the brain tissue is implanted into their skulls. Once the brain transplant has been completed, the white person's consciousness takes control over the black host body; meanwhile, the consciousness of the black person remains in The Sunken Place. While in the Sunken Place, the black person's consciousness is completely intact and aware of what is going on, yet has no control over their body. In Maxwell Atoms' Cartoon Network series Evil Con Carne (2003‚Äì2004), Hector Con Carne was reduced to a brain and a stomach and both of them were put in jars attached to the body of a Russian circus bear. Hector's brain is the main character of the cartoon. Edgar Rice Burroughs' The Mastermind of Mars involves a surgeon who does this as his main operation, and a man from Earth, the narrator and main character, who is trained to do it as well. In Neil R. Jones Professeur Jameson stories (1931), the main character is the last earthman, whose brain is saved by some alien cyborgs called the Zoromes, and is inserted into a robotic body, making him immortal. Robert Heinlein's 1970 science fiction novel, I Will Fear No Evil, features a main character named Johann Sebastian Bach Smith whose entire brain is transplanted into his deceased secretary's skull. In the horror film The Skeleton Key, the protagonist, Caroline, discovers that the old couple she is looking after are poor Voodoo witch doctors who stole the bodies of two young, privileged children in their care using a ritual which allows a soul to swap bodies. Unfortunately the evil old couple also trick Caroline and their lawyer into the same procedure, and both end up stuck in old dying bodies unable to speak while the witch doctors walk off with their young bodies. In Anne Rice's The Tale of the Body Thief, the vampire Lestat discovers a man, Raglan James, who can will himself into another person's body. Lestat demands that the procedure be used on him to allow him to be human once again, but soon finds that he has made an error and is forced to recapture James in his vampiric form so he can take his body back. Similar in many ways to this is the idea of mind uploading, promoted by Marvin Minsky and others with a mechanistic view of natural intelligence and an optimistic outlook regarding artificial intelligence. It is also a goal of Ra√´lism, a small cult based in Florida, France, and Quebec. While the ultimate goal of transplanting is transfer of the brain to a new body optimized for it by genetics, proteomics, and/or other medical procedures, in uploading the brain itself moves nowhere and may even be physically destroyed or discarded; the goal is rather to duplicate the information patterns contained within the brain. Another similar literary theme, though different from either procedure described above, is the transplanting of a human brain into an artificial, usually robotic, body. Examples of this include: Caprica; Ghost in the Shell; RoboCop; the DC Comics superhero Robotman; the Cybermen from the Doctor Who television series; the cymeks in the Legends of Dune series; or full-body cyborgs in many manga or works in the cyberpunk genre. In one episode of Star Trek, Spock's Brain is stolen and installed in a large computer-like structure; and in \\"I, Mudd\\" Uhura is offered immortality in an android body. The novel Harvest of Stars by Poul Anderson features many central characters who undergo such transplants, and deals with the difficult decisions facing a human contemplating such a procedure. In the 'Star Wars expanded universe the shadow droids were created by taking the brains of grievously wounded TIE fighter pilot aces. After surgically transplanting them into a protective cocoon filled with nutrient fluids. they were surgically connected to cybernetic hardware that gave them external sensors, flight control and tactical computers that augmented their reflexes beyond the biological limit; at the cost of their humanity. Emperor Palpatine also imbued them with the dark side giving them a sixth sense, and making them into extensions of his own will.

The Sacred Function of the Revolutionary Subject It originated at the beginning of the 20th century in Russia and was associated with the activities of the Bolshevik faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party ‚Äì and first of all, the founder of the faction, Vladimir Lenin. Remaining on the soil of Marxism, Bolshevism at the same time absorbed elements of the ideology and practice of the revolutionaries of the second half of the 19th century (Sergey Nechaev, Pyotr Tkachev, Nikolay Chernyshevsky) and had many points of contact with such domestic left‚Äìwing radical movements as populism. The main theorist of Bolshevism was Lenin, besides him, the theoreticians of Bolshevism include Joseph Stalin, Nikolai Bukharin, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky and sometimes Rosa Luxemburg. In October 1917, the Bolshevik faction organized an armed uprising against the Provisional Government, formed by other (including socialist) parties and seized power (see the October Revolution). The historical consequences of these actions both for Russia and for the world as a whole have opposite assessments. Some researchersVladik Nersesyants. History of Political and Legal Doctrines also attribute the activities of Joseph Stalin to the Bolshevik theory, who headed the All‚ÄìUnion Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and at the same time possessed full state power in the Soviet Union. However, others (both Stalin's contemporaries and later) do not confuse \\"Bolshevism\\" and \\"Stalinism\\" proper, considering them to be multidirectional (revolutionary and thermidorian) phenomena.See various works by Trotsky, Martemyan Ryutin (Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship), Fyodor Raskolnikov (An Open Letter to Stalin), Boris Kagarlitsky, Alexander Tarasov The expression \\"Bolshevism\\", as well as \\"communism\\" later, has become established in Western historiography in the sense of a certain set of features of Soviet power in a certain political period. At present, the very name \\"Bolsheviks\\" is actively used by various groups of Marxist-Leninists and Trotskyists. History The concept of Bolshevism arose at the Second Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (1903) as a result of the split of the party into two factions: supporters of Lenin and the rest.Despite the ordinal number adopted in Soviet historiography, the London Congress was actually a constituent one, since the Minsk Congress had no practical significance One of the main reasons for the split was the question of a party of a new type. In the course of work on the Charter of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, Vladimir Lenin and Yuliy Martov proposed two different wordings of the clause on party membership. Lenin ‚Äì a party member is a citizen who recognizes the program and charter, pays membership fees and works in one of the party organizations. Martov suggested limiting the charter to the first two requirements. During the elections to the central organs of the party, the majority was won by supporters of the Leninist formulation, after which Lenin began to call his faction \\"Bolsheviks\\", while Martov called his supporters \\"Mensheviks\\". Although in the subsequent history of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, Lenin's supporters often found themselves in the minority, they were assigned the politically advantageous name \\"Bolsheviks\\".There is an opinion that the adoption of such an unprofitable name of the faction was a major blunder for Martov and, on the contrary: the consolidation of the momentary electoral success in the name of the faction was a strong political move of Lenin As Lenin's biographer Robert Service points out, the division of the newly created party into two factions \\"plunged Russian Marxists into a state of shock\\". All but the extreme left Petersburg Marxists disagreed with Lenin's party policy. At the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party in 1906, the organizational unity of the party was temporarily restored. At the Fifth Congress, the Central Committee was elected, which, due to disagreements between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks, turned out to be unworkable, and the Bolshevik Center, headed by Vladimir Lenin, which was created during the Congress by Bolshevik delegates at one of its factional meetings, arbitrarily took over the leadership of the Bolshevik organizations of the party. At the Sixth (Prague) Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, held on January 18‚Äì30, 1912, which constituted itself as the all‚Äìparty conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and the supreme organ of the party, almost exclusively Lenin's supporters were represented. By this time, the central committee of the party had virtually ceased to exist (its last plenum was held in January 1910), and the party found itself without an official leading center. In this regard, a Bolshevik Central Committee was elected at the Prague Conference. In 1916, Lenin wrote his work Imperialism as the Highest Stage of Capitalism, which was a major contribution to the development of classical Marxism in the new conditions. In this work the thesis about the unevenness of economic and political development of capitalism in the epoch of imperialism was expressed and theoretically grounded, which leads to the conclusion about the possibility of the victory of socialism initially in a few or in one single country, which is not yet economically developed enough ‚Äì such as Russia ‚Äì provided that the head of the revolutionary movement will be a disciplined avant‚Äìgarde, ready to go all the way to the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Immediately after the outbreak of the World War, Lenin and his supporters advanced the slogan of the defeat of tsarism in the war and the transformation of the imperialist war into a civil war. It was with this that Lenin's criticism of the so‚Äìcalled \\"social‚Äìchauvinists\\", who supported their governments in the world war, was connected.Vladimir Lenin.

Pages 133 By the beginning of the February Revolution, the leading figures of the Bolshevik faction were mainly in exile or in emigration, and therefore the Bolsheviks did not take an organized part in it. The Bolshevik leaders who returned from exile, who, along with the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, became members of the Petrograd Soviet, at first tended to cooperate with the Provisional Government. From the very beginning, while still abroad, Lenin insisted on the immediate break of the Petrograd Soviet with the Provisional Government in order to actively prepare for the transition from the bourgeois‚Äìdemocratic to the next, \\"proletarian\\" stage of the revolution, the seizure of power and the end of the war. Returning to Russia, he came up with a new program of action for the Bolshevik party ‚Äì the April Theses ‚Äì in which he put on the agenda the demand for the transfer of all power to the Soviets in the interests of the proletariat and the poorest peasantry. Faced with resistance even among the representatives of \\"theoretical\\", \\"scientific\\" Bolshevism, Lenin managed to overcome it, relying on the support of the lower classes ‚Äì local party organizations, adherents of immediate practical action.St√©phane Courtois, Nicolas Werth, Jean‚ÄìLouis Pannet, Andrzej Paczkowski, Karel Bartoszek, Jean‚ÄìLouis Margolen, With the Participation of Remy Coffer, Pierre Rigulo, Pascal Fontaine, Yves Santamaria, Sylvain Buluc, \\"The Black Book of Communism: Crime, Terror, Repression\\", Three Centuries of History, Moscow, 1999, Translated Under the Direction of Evgeny Khramov. Part 1. \\"The State Against Its People\\". Chapter 1. Paradoxes of October In the course of the unfolding controversy about the possibility of socialism in Russia, Lenin rejected all the critical arguments of the Mensheviks, socialist revolutionaries and other political opponents about the country's unpreparedness for a socialist revolution due to its economic backwardness, weakness, lack of culture and organization of the working masses, including the proletariat, about the danger the split of the revolutionary democratic forces and the inevitability of a civil war. In April 1917, the split of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party was finalized. During a heated discussion at the 7th All‚ÄìRussian (April) Conference of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) (April 24‚Äì29), the April Theses received the support of the majority of delegates from the localities and formed the basis of the policy of the entire party. The Bolshevik faction became known as the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks). The Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was renamed the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) at the 7th (April) Conference in 1917. In March 1918, the party adopted the name of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks),The famous theorist of Marxism Karl Kautsky explained the change in the name of Lenin's party as follows: > [The Bolsheviks] destroyed the democracy that the people had conquered in > the March revolution. Accordingly, the Bolsheviks ceased to call themselves > social democrats, and adopted the name of communists. > True, they do not want to completely abandon democracy. Lenin, in his > speech on April 28, calls the Soviet organization \\"the highest type of > democracy\\", \\"a complete break with its bourgeois caricature\\". For the > proletarian and the poor peasant, complete freedom has now been restored. > But democracy is still understood as the equality of political rights for > all citizens. The privileged layers have always enjoyed freedom. But this is > not called democracy. Quote by: Karl Kautsky. \\"Dictatorship of the Proletariat\\" and in December 1925, the All‚ÄìUnion Communist Party (Bolsheviks). At the 19th Congress in October 1952, the All‚ÄìUnion Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was renamed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1990, at the last, 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, during the legalization of political platforms within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik Platform was formed, giving rise to several modern political parties and social movements. Bolshevism and private property Realizing the Leninist slogan \\"plunder the loot\\", the Bolsheviks en masse carried out a complete confiscation (expropriation) from the owners of private property, which they considered acquired through the exploitation of the working people, that is, the robbery of the workers. At the same time, the Bolsheviks never found out whether private property was obtained through their own labor, or through the exploitation of other people, whether the owners adequately paid for hired labor, what part of the confiscated private property the owner created with his own labor.Vladimir Lenin.

Party Gold Bolsheviks and the Revolution There is an opinion that the Bolsheviks strove for revolution, regardless of the political situation and historical realities. This is how the famous Social Democrat Alexander Parvus wrote in 1918: > The essence of Bolshevism is simple ‚Äì to ignite the revolution everywhere, > not choosing the time, regardless of the political situation and other > historical realities. Whoever is against is the enemy, and the conversation > with the enemies is short ‚Äì they are subject to urgent and unconditional > destruction. Support for the Bolsheviks by the people According to the British historian Orlando Figes, the opinion that the Bolsheviks were raised to the top of power by massive popular support for their party is not true and is a delusion. According to Figes, the October Uprising in Petrograd was a coup d'√©tat supported by only a small part of the population. Figes explains the success of the Bolsheviks by the fact that the latter were the only political party that uncompromisingly advocated the slogan \\"all power to the Soviets\\", which gained great popularity in 1917 after the unsuccessful Revolt of General Kornilov. As Figes points out, in the fall of 1917, there was a stream of resolutions from factories, from villages, from army units, calling for the formation of a Soviet government. At the same time, the authors of the resolutions understood \\"the power of the Soviets\\" as the All‚ÄìRussian Council with the participation of all socialist parties. Meanwhile, the commitment of the Bolsheviks to the principle of Soviet power was not at all so unconditional. In July 1917, when the Bolshevik Party was unable to obtain a majority in the Soviets of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies, it \\"temporarily removed\\" the slogan \\"All Power to the Soviets!\\". After the October coup, during the so‚Äìcalled \\"triumphal march of Soviet power\\" in those cases when individual councils did not agree to become the organs of the dictatorship of the Russian Social‚ÄìDemocratic Workers' Party (Bolsheviks), the Bolsheviks did not hesitate to disperse them and replace them by emergency bodies ‚Äì revolutionary committees, military revolutionary committees, etc.Pavel Kostogryzov.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Left Opposition to Stalin adopted the self‚Äìdesignation \\"Bolshevik‚ÄìLeninists\\", thereby emphasizing its continuity with the revolutionary tradition as opposed to Thermidorian Stalinism. After the political trials of the 1930s, most of the \\"Leninist Guards\\" were repressed. Proceeding from this, there is an opinion that Bolshevism as a phenomenon has left the historical scene: > ...[Stalin] managed to destroy almost all of Lenin's comrades‚Äìin‚Äìarms in > Russia, becoming by 1928‚Äì1939 \\"the Russian Bonaparte‚ÄìRobespierre\\" in the > country, \\"especially double types of cultures of the pre‚Äìbourgeois order, > that is, the cultures of the bureaucratic, serfdom\\" (and terrorist ‚Äì we > add), which Lenin feared so much, grew up in the country.Vladimir Lenin. > Full Composition of Writings.

In 425 BC, the Spartans had lost the Battles of Pylos and Sphacteria, a severe defeat resulting in the Athenians holding 292 prisoners. At least 120 were Spartiates, who had recovered by 424 BC, when the Spartan general Brasidas captured Amphipolis. In the same year, the Athenians suffered a major defeat in Boeotia at the Battle of Delium, and in 422 BC, they were defeated again at the Battle of Amphipolis in their attempt to take back that city. Both Brasidas, the leading Spartan general, and Cleon, the leading politician in Athens, were killed at Amphipolis. By then, both sides were exhausted and ready for peace. The negotiations were begun by Pleistoanax, King of Sparta, and the Athenian general Nicias. Both decided to return everything that they had conquered during the war except for Nisaea, which would remain in Athenian hands, and Plataea, which remained under the control of Thebes. Most notably, Amphipolis would be returned to Athens, and the Athenians would release the prisoners taken at Sphacteria. Temples throughout Greece would be open to worshippers from all cities, and the oracle at Delphi would regain its autonomy. Athens could continue to collect tribute from the states from which it had received it since the time of Aristides, but Athens could not force them to become allies. Athens also agreed to come to Sparta's aid if the helots revolted. All of Sparta's allies agreed to sign the peace, except for Boeotia, Corinth, Elis, and Megara. Seventeen representatives from each side swore an oath to uphold the treaty, which was meant to last for fifty years. The Spartan representatives were the kings Pleistoanax and Agis II, Pleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antiphus, Tellis, Alcindas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus. The Athenian representatives were Lampon, Isthmonicus, Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes. However, Athens's chief goal, the restoration of Amphipolis, was denied when Clearidas obtained from the Spartans a clause in the treaty negating the transfer. Thus, the treaty was broken from the start and, after several more failures, was formally abandoned in 414 BC. Thus, the Peloponnesian War resumed in its second stage.

Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1 (1971), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case dealing with the busing of students to promote integration in public schools.. The Court held that busing was an appropriate remedy for the problem of racial imbalance in schools, even when the imbalance resulted from the selection of students based on geographic proximity to the school rather than from deliberate assignment based on race. This was done to ensure the schools would be \\"properly\\" integrated and that all students would receive equal educational opportunities regardless of their race. Judge John J. Parker of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit interpreted the Brown v. Board of Education case as a charge not to segregate rather than an order to integrate. In 1963, the Court ruled in McNeese v. Board of Education and Goss v. Board of Education in favor of integration, and showed impatience with efforts to end segregation. In 1968 the Warren Court ruled in Green v. County School Board that freedom of choice plans were insufficient to eliminate segregation; thus, it was necessary to take proactive steps to integrate schools. In United States v. Montgomery County Board of Education (1969), Judge Frank Johnson's desegregation order for teachers was upheld, allowing an approximate ratio of the races to be established by a district judge.  Background  North Carolina was one of the more moderate Southern states, and its resistance to integration was much weaker than in most other areas of the South. After Brown, it had ended segregation with a school assignment plan based on neighborhoods that was approved by the Court. However, when Charlotte consolidated school districts from the city itself with a surrounding area totaling , the majority of black students (who lived in central Charlotte) still attended mostly black schools as compared with majority white schools further outside the city. Legal proceedings The NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought the Swann case on behalf of six-year-old James Swann and nine other families, with Julius L. Chambers presenting the case. Swann was chosen because his father was a theology professor, and was thus unlikely to be economically burdened by local retaliation. In 1965, Judge J. Braxton Craven decided Swann v. Charlotte- Mecklenburg Board of Education in favor of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, because there was no requirement in the Constitution to act purposely to increase racial mixing. After the Green ruling, the Swann case was filed again, and this time taken by Judge James B. McMillan as his first important case on the federal bench. McMillan had at one point been a public opponent of busing to integrate schools, but when the case was presented to him he said that the facts outweighed his feelings, and busing was the only way to fulfill the constitutional requirement of desegregation. Experts from Rhode Island College were brought in for the Plaintiff's side to judge the effectiveness of the school board's new plan. From April to November 1969, McMillan repeatedly ordered the board to revise the plan. The Board eventually submitted a plan rezoning neighborhoods into pie-shaped wedges, where blacks living in the center of Charlotte would be divided up and distributed to outlying, formerly white high schools. The school board's plan required busing and would achieve a black population of 2-36% in all ten of the high schools. Due to the greater number of elementary schools, elaborate gerrymandering was required and would achieve greater integration, but would leave more than half of black elementary students at majority-black schools. The Court rejected the Board's plan in favor of outsider Dr. John Finger's plan. The Finger Plan required busing of an additional 300 black students, established \\"satellite zones\\" and required pairing and grouping techniques to achieve even greater integration. As a consequence, McMillan became a local pariah.\\"The Charlotte Mecklenburg Story\\" http://cmstory.org/content/signs-times#McMillan Chambers' home, office and car were bombed when he first took up the case.\\"The Charlotte Mecklenburg Story\\" https://web.archive.org/web/20050217014254/http://www.cmstory.org/aaa2/events/70/111e.html When the case was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the case was heard en banc by six of the seven judges sitting on the court. The seventh judge Judge J. Braxton Craven, recused himself due to him being the original trial court judge. The opinion was 3-2-1 that the restructured busing orders should be affirmed for older students, but that it be remanded for those of elementary school age. Two dissenters would have affirmed the whole decision, while one would reverse McMillan's ruling in its entirety. McMillan decided to follow his original plan for elementary school students after the case was remanded to him. Swann before the Supreme Court Justice Douglas had previously been strongly opposed to busing. The Court was urged to begin their term early to hear the case, but decided to wait until the first day of their new term to begin. Despite his relative youth and inexperience, Julius Chambers argued the case, because of his intimate knowledge of the facts involved. Erwin Griswold, the Solicitor General of the United States, represented the federal government, advocating Nixon's ‚Äúgo-slow‚Äù policy. Though no official vote was taken, Chief Justice Burger and Justice Black wanted to reverse McMillan's order, while Justices Douglas, Harlan, Brennan, and Marshall wanted a strong affirmation of the order; Justices Stewart, White, and Blackmun did not express a strong feeling either way. Douglas, Brennan, and Marshall were quite liberal, but Harlan was usually conservative. When Burger circulated his very grudging affirmation of McMillan that limited future action and action in other areas by the Court, he met strong resistance. Douglas, Harlan, Brennan, and Marshall all demanded revisions and circulated suggestions for alternate drafts. Justice Stewart also reacted strongly after carefully considering the facts of the case, and wrote a ‚Äúdissent‚Äù that would have been the opinion of the court without revisions of Burger's drafts. Burger revised the opinion five times, each time making a stronger affirmation of McMillan and incorporating the language of Harlan, Brennan, Stewart, and others into it. After the fifth draft, Justice Black threatened a dissent if the opinion was made any stronger an affirmation, and so a sixth and final draft was created that was close to what Justice Stewart had composed after the first conference. The final opinion was 9-0 affirming McMillan's order. The decision led to the widespread use of busing to end segregation by federal judges in the South. Timeline of the case being overturned When the courts mandated that busing should occur to desegregate the schools, they also noted that one day when the school system was thought to be unitary, busing would end and the school board would be able to come up with a new plan which would best suit the education of students in Charlotte-Mecklenburg. Integrated busing in Charlotte in 1973 After busing was enforced in 1971, throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, Charlotte was known across the nation as the ‚Äúcity that made desegregation work.‚Äù It paved the way for many different school systems to use the busing plan to force integration in the school systems.Godwin, R.K., Leland, S.M., Baxter, A.D., and Southworth, S. (2006). Sinking Swann: Public School Choice and the Resegregation of Charlotte‚Äôs Public Schools. Review of Policy Research, 23(5), 983-997. However, due to the booming economy of the city in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Charlotte experienced a rapid immigration from the Northeast and the Midwest, which resulted in a decline of the acceptance of busing. In 1992, in response to these complaints, CMS created a managed choice plan to reduce the number of students being bused. This new choice plan revolved around magnet schools, making one-third of the schools in Charlotte-Mecklenburg either magnets or partial magnets, and each magnet had a quota of black and white students that were allowed to attend. But this didn't please many white families who were denied entrance into magnet schools that had fulfilled their quotas. In 1997, a parent, William Capacchione, sued the school system when his daughter was denied entrance into a magnet school for the second time based on her race.Marcus, D.L. (1999). After the Buses Stop. US News & World Report, 127(23), 38-39 While the school system opposed the end of busing, Judge Robert D. Potter declared the mandate of a unitary system had been met and lifted the court order on mandatory busing by race or ethnicity. This ruling was upheld by the appeals court in Richmond, Virginia in 2000 and after the final appeal was declined to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, federal order of busing was ended in Charlotte-Mecklenburg and it was left in the hands of the city school board to decide how to redo the assignment policy for school attendance.Walsh, M. (2002). High Court Closes Historic Desegregation Case. Education Week, 21(32), 31-33. The new assignment policy which was adopted in the fall of 2002 was known as the ‚ÄúSchool Choice Plan.‚Äù This new choice plan divided the city into four large attendance zones based on neighborhoods. Students were allowed to choose to stay at their neighborhood \\"home school,\\" or they could rank their top three choices of any other school in CMS; however they would only receive free transportation to their home school or any of the magnet schools in the district. If families chose their home school as their first choice, they were guaranteed that school; otherwise they were entered into a lottery that gave available spaces in overenrolled schools. If people did not choose a school, they were immediately placed into their home school. After creating a variety of programs to inform families about the new plan, over 95% of the families in the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school system submitted choices for the new school year.

I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that the is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase ‚Äúpassive resistance‚Äù, in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word ‚Äúsatyagraha‚Äù itself or some other equivalent English phrase.‚Äù or truth force, is a particular form of nonviolent resistance or civil resistance. Someone who practices satyagraha is a satyagrahi. The term satyagraha was coined and developed by Mahatma Gandhi (1869‚Äì1948). He deployed satyagraha in the Indian independence movement and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa for Indian rights. Satyagraha theory influenced Martin Luther King Jr.'s and James Bevel's campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, as well as Nelson Mandela's struggle against apartheid in South Africa and many other social justice and similar movements.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/525247/satyagraha \\"Gandhi‚Äôs satyagraha became a major tool in the Indian struggle against British imperialism and has since been adopted by protest groups in other countries.\\" Date accessed: 14 September 2010.https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d;=9165422 \\"In this respect Satyagraha or non-violent resistance, as conceived by Gandhi, has an important lesson for pacifists and war-resisters of the West. Western pacifists have so far proved ineffective because they have thought that war can be resisted by mere propaganda, conscientious objection, and organization for settling disputes.\\" Date accessed: 14 September 2010.  Origin and meaning of name  The terms originated in a competition in the news-sheet Indian Opinion in South Africa in 1906. Mr. Maganlal Gandhi, grandson of an uncle of Mahatma Gandhi, came up with the word \\"Sadagraha\\" and won the prize. Subsequently, to make it clearer, Gandhi changed it to Satyagraha. \\"Satyagraha\\" is a tatpuru·π£a compound of the Sanskrit words satya (meaning \\"truth\\") and ƒÅgraha (\\"polite insistence\\", or \\"holding firmly to\\"). Satya is derived from the word \\"sat\\", which means \\"being\\". Nothing is or exists in reality except Truth. In the context of satyagraha, Truth therefore includes a) Truth in speech, as opposed to falsehood, b) what is real, as opposed to nonexistent (asat) and c) good as opposed to evil, or bad. This was critical to Gandhi's understanding of and faith in nonviolence: \\"The world rests upon the bedrock of satya or truth. Asatya, meaning untruth, also means nonexistent, and satya or truth also means that which is. If untruth does not so much as exist, its victory is out of the question. And truth being that which is, can never be destroyed. This is the doctrine of satyagraha in a nutshell.\\"Nagler, Michael N. The Nonviolence Handbook: A Guide for Practical Action. Print. For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere \\"passive resistance\\" and became strength in practising non-violent methods. In his words: In September 1935, a letter to P. K. Rao, Servants of India Society, Gandhi disputed the proposition that his idea of civil disobedience was adapted from the writings of Henry David Thoreau, especially the essay Civil Disobedience published in 1849. Gandhi described it as follows:  Contrast to \\"passive resistance\\"  Gandhi distinguished between satyagraha and passive resistance in the following letter: Ahinsa and satyagraha There is a connection between ahinsa and satyagraha. Satyagraha is sometimes used to refer to the whole principle of nonviolence, where it is essentially the same as ahimsa, and sometimes used in a \\"marked\\" meaning to refer specifically to direct action that is largely obstructive, for example in the form of civil disobedience. Gandhi says: = Defining success = Assessing the extent to which Gandhi's ideas of satyagraha were or were not successful in the Indian independence struggle is a complex task. Judith Brown has suggested that \\"this is a political strategy and technique which, for its outcomes, depends of historical specificities.\\"Brown, Judith M., \\"Gandhi and Civil Resistance in India, 1917‚Äì47: Key Issues\\", in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non- violent Action from Gandhi to the Present, Oxford University Press, 2009 p. 57 The view taken by Gandhi differs from the idea that the goal in any conflict is necessarily to defeat the opponent or frustrate the opponent's objectives, or to meet one's own objectives despite the efforts of the opponent to obstruct these. In satyagraha, by contrast, \\"The Satyagrahi's object is to convert, not to coerce, the wrong-doer.\\"Gandhi, M.K. ‚ÄúRequisite Qualifications‚Äù Harijan 25 March 1939 The opponent must be converted, at least as far as to stop obstructing the just end, for this cooperation to take place. There are cases, to be sure, when an opponent, e.g. a dictator, has to be unseated and one cannot wait to convert him. The satyagrahi would count this a partial success. = Means and ends = The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. The means used to obtain an end are wrapped up in and attached to that end. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use unjust means to obtain justice or to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: \\"They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end...\\"R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section ‚ÄúThe Gospel Of Sarvodaya, of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi , Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. Gandhi used an example to explain this: Gandhi rejected the idea that injustice should, or even could, be fought against \\"by any means necessary\\"‚Äîif you use violent, coercive, unjust means, whatever ends you produce will necessarily embed that injustice. To those who preached violence and called nonviolent actionists cowards, he replied: \\"I do believe that, where there is only a choice between cowardice and violence, I would advise violence....I would rather have India resort to arms in order to defend her honour than that she should, in a cowardly manner, become or remain a helpless witness to her own dishonour....But I believe that nonviolence is infinitely superior to violence, forgiveness is greater than punishment.\\"R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section ‚ÄúBetween Cowardice and Violence,‚Äù of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi , Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. However, in the same book Gandhi makes the opposite argument. He admits that even though his book argues that machinery is bad, it was produced by machinery, which he says can do nothing good. Thus, he says, \\"sometimes poison is used to kill poison\\" and for that reason as long as machinery is viewed as bad it can be used to undo itself.Gandhi, Hind Swaraj, p85. https://www.mkgandhi.org/ebks/hind_swaraj.pdf = Satyagraha versus duragraha = The essence of satyagraha is that it seeks to eliminate antagonisms without harming the antagonists themselves, as opposed to violent resistance, which is meant to cause harm to the antagonist. A satyagrahi therefore does not seek to end or destroy the relationship with the antagonist, but instead seeks to transform or \\"purify\\" it to a higher level. A euphemism sometimes used for satyagraha is that it is a \\"silent force\\" or a \\"soul force\\" (a term also used by Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech). It arms the individual with moral power rather than physical power. Satyagraha is also termed a \\"universal force,\\" as it essentially \\"makes no distinction between kinsmen and strangers, young and old, man and woman, friend and foe.\\"Gandhi, M.K. ‚ÄúSome Rules of Satyagraha‚Äù Young India (Navajivan) 23 February 1930 (The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi vol. 48, p. 340) Gandhi contrasted satyagraha (holding on to truth) with \\"duragraha\\" (holding on by force), as in protest meant more to harass than enlighten opponents. He wrote: \\"There must be no impatience, no barbarity, no insolence, no undue pressure. If we want to cultivate a true spirit of democracy, we cannot afford to be intolerant. Intolerance betrays want of faith in one's cause.\\"R. K. Prabhu & U. R. Rao, editors; from section ‚ÄúPower of Satyagraha,‚Äù of the book The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi , Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967. Civil disobedience and non-cooperation as practised under satyagraha are based on the \\"law of suffering\\",Gandhi, M.K. ‚ÄúThe Law of Suffering‚Äù Young India 16 June 1920 a doctrine that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral uplift or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, the non-cooperation of satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent that is consistent with truth and justice. Large-scale usage of satyagraha When using satyagraha in a large- scale political conflict involving civil disobedience, Gandhi believed that the satyagrahis must undergo training to ensure discipline. He wrote that it is \\"only when people have proved their active loyalty by obeying the many laws of the State that they acquire the right of Civil Disobedience.\\" He therefore made part of the discipline that satyagrahis: # Appreciate the other laws of the State and obey them voluntarily # Tolerate these laws, even when they are inconvenient # Be willing to undergo suffering, loss of property, and to endure the suffering that might be inflicted on family and friendsGandhi, M. K. ‚ÄúPre-requisites for Satyagraha‚Äù Young India 1 August 1925 This obedience has to be not merely grudging, but extraordinary:  Principles  Gandhi envisioned satyagraha as not only a tactic to be used in acute political struggle, but as a universal solvent for injustice and harm. He founded the Sabarmati Ashram to teach satyagraha. He asked satyagrahis to follow the following principles (Yamas described in Yoga Sutra):Gandhi, M.K. Non-violent Resistance (Satyagraha) (1961) p. 37 # Nonviolence (ahimsa) # Truth ‚Äì this includes honesty, but goes beyond it to mean living fully in accord with and in devotion to that which is true # Not stealing # Non-possession (not the same as poverty) # Body-labour or bread-labour # Control of desires (gluttony) # Fearlessness # Equal respect for all religions # Economic strategy such as boycott of imported goods (swadeshi) On another occasion, he listed these rules as \\"essential for every Satyagrahi in India\\": # Must have a living faith in God # Must be leading a chaste life, and be willing to die or lose all his possessions # Must be a habitual khadi weaver and spinner # Must abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants  Rules for satyagraha campaigns  Gandhi proposed a series of rules for satyagrahis to follow in a resistance campaign: # Harbour no anger. # Suffer the anger of the opponent. # Never retaliate to assaults or punishment; but do not submit, out of fear of punishment or assault, to an order given in anger. # Voluntarily submit to arrest or confiscation of your own property. # If you are a trustee of property, defend that property (non-violently) from confiscation with your life. # Do not curse or swear. # Do not insult the opponent. # Neither salute nor insult the flag of your opponent or your opponent's leaders. # If anyone attempts to insult or assault your opponent, defend your opponent (non-violently) with your life. # As a prisoner, behave courteously and obey prison regulations (except any that are contrary to self-respect). # As a prisoner, do not ask for special favourable treatment. # As a prisoner, do not fast in an attempt to gain conveniences whose deprivation does not involve any injury to your self- respect. # Joyfully obey the orders of the leaders of the civil disobedience action.  American Civil Rights Movement  Satyagraha theory also influenced many other movements of nonviolence and civil resistance. For example, Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in his autobiography about Gandhi's influence on his developing ideas regarding the Civil Rights Movement in the United States:  Satyagraha in relation to genocide  In view of the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany, Gandhi offered satyagraha as a method of combating oppression and genocide, stating: When Gandhi was criticized for these statements, he responded in another article entitled \\"Some Questions Answered\\": In a similar vein, anticipating a possible attack on India by Japan during World War II, Gandhi recommended satyagraha as a means of national defense (what is now sometimes called \\"Civilian Based Defense\\" (CBD) or \\"social defence\\"):  See also  * Nonviolence * Gandhi Heritage Portal * People Power Revolution * Resistance movement * Salt March * Constructive Program  References  External links  * 'Satyagraha 100 Years Later', a retrospective with Arun Gandhi from Democracy Now! * The Story of Satyagraha by Dr. Jyotsna Kamat * GandhiPoetics.com A site that analyzes and previews the poetry associated with Gandhi's Satyagraha movement. * Satyagraha in South Africa Category:Activism by type Category:Ethical schools and movements Category:Gandhism * Category:Pacifism in India Category:Truth ","title":"Satyagraha"},{"id":"167150","text":"Alfred Louis Charles de Musset-Pathay (; 11 December 1810 ‚Äì 2 May 1857) was a French dramatist, poet, and novelist.His names are often reversed \\"Louis Charles Alfred de Musset\\": see \\"(Louis Charles) Alfred de Musset\\" (bio), Biography.com, 2007, webpage: Bio9413.\\"Chessville ‚Äì Alfred de Musset: Romantic Player\\", Robert T. Tuohey, Chessville.com, 2006, webpage: Chessville-deMusset . Along with his poetry, he is known for writing the autobiographical novel La Confession d'un enfant du si√®cle (The Confession of a Child of the Century). Biography Commemorative plaque, Mont-Thabor street, Paris Musset was born in Paris. His family was upper-class but poor and his father worked in various key government positions, but never gave his son any money. His mother came from similar circumstances, and her role as a society hostess ‚Äì for example her drawing-room parties, luncheons and dinners held in the Musset residence ‚Äì left a lasting impression on young Alfred. Early indications of Musset's boyhood talents were seen by his fondness for acting impromptu mini-plays based upon episodes from old romance stories he had read. Years later, elder brother Paul de Musset would preserve these, and many other details, for posterity, in a biography on his famous younger brother. Alfred de Musset entered the lyc√©e Henri-IV at the age of nine, where in 1827 he won the Latin essay prize in the Concours g√©n√©ral. With the help of Paul Foucher, Victor Hugo's brother-in-law, he began to attend, at the age of 17, the C√©nacle, the literary salon of Charles Nodier at the Biblioth√®que de l'Arsenal. After attempts at careers in medicine (which he gave up owing to a distaste for dissections), law, drawing, English and piano, he became one of the first Romantic writers, with his first collection of poems, Contes d'Espagne et d'Italie (1829, Tales of Spain and Italy). By the time he reached the age of 20, his rising literary fame was already accompanied by a sulphurous reputation fed by his dandy side. He was the librarian of the French Ministry of the Interior under the July Monarchy. His politics were of a Liberal stamp and he was on good terms with the family of Louis Philippe I. During this time he also involved himself in polemics during the Rhine crisis of 1840, caused by the French prime minister Adolphe Thiers, who as Minister of the Interior had been Musset's superior. had demanded that France should own the left bank of the Rhine (described as France's \\"natural boundary\\"), as it had under Napoleon, despite the territory's German population. These demands were rejected by German songs and poems, including Nikolaus Becker's Rheinlied, which contained the verse: \\"Sie sollen ihn nicht haben, den freien, deutschen Rhein ...\\" (They shall not have it, the free, German Rhine). Musset answered to this with a poem of his own: \\"Nous l'avons eu, votre Rhin allemand\\" (We've had it, your German Rhine). The tale of his celebrated love affair with George Sand in 1833‚Äì1835 is told from his point of view in his autobiographical novel La Confession d'un Enfant du Si√®cle (The Confession of a Child of the Century) (1836), which was made into a 1999 film, Children of the Century, and a 2012 film, Confession of a Child of the Century, and is told from her point of view in her Elle et lui (1859). Musset's Nuits (Nights) (1835‚Äì1837) traces the emotional upheaval of his love for Sand from early despair to final resignation. He is also believed to be the anonymous author of Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess (1833), a lesbian erotic novel also believed to be modeled on Sand. Outside of his relationship to Sand, he was a well-known figure in brothels and is widely accepted to be the anonymous author-client who beat and humiliated the author and courtesan C√©leste de Chabrillan, also known as La Mogador. Tomb of Alfred de Musset in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery Musset was dismissed from his post as librarian by the new minister Ledru-Rollin after the revolution of 1848. He was, however, appointed librarian of the Ministry of Public Instruction in 1853. On 24 April 1845 Musset received the L√©gion d'honneur at the same time as Balzac, and was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1852 after two failed attempts in 1848 and 1850. Alfred de Musset died in his sleep in Paris in 1857. The cause was heart failure, the combination of alcoholism and a longstanding aortic insufficiency. One symptom that had been noticed by his brother was a bobbing of the head as a result of the amplification of the pulse; this was later called de Musset's sign.\\"Twelve eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation, one of which was named after a patient instead of a physician\\", in: The American Journal of Cardiology, vol. 93, issue 10, 15 May 2004, pp. 1332‚Äì3; by Tsung O. Cheng MD. He was buried in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Reception Rolla by Henri Gervex, 1878 The French poet Arthur Rimbaud was highly critical of Musset's work. Rimbaud wrote in his Letters of a Seer (Lettres du Voyant) that Musset did not accomplish anything because he \\"closed his eyes\\" before the visions (Letter to Paul Demeny, May 1871). Director Jean Renoir's La r√®gle du jeu (The Rules of the Game) was inspired by Musset's play Les Caprices de Marianne. Henri Gervex's 1878 painting Rolla was based on a poem by De Musset. It was rejected by the jury of the Salon de Paris for immorality, since it features suggestive metaphors in a scene from the poem, with a naked prostitute after having sex with her client, but the controversy helped Gervex's career. Music Numerous (often French) composers wrote works using Musset's poetry during the 19th and early 20th century. ; Opera Georges Bizet's opera Djamileh (1871, with a libretto by Louis Gallet) is based on Musset's story Namouna. The play La Coupe et les l√®vres was the basis of Giacomo Puccini's opera Edgar (1889). Dame Ethel Smyth composed an opera based on Fantasio that premiered in Weimar in 1898. The opera Andrea del Sarto (1968) by French composer Jean-Yves Daniel-Lesur (1908‚Äì2002) was based on Musset's play Andr√© del Sarto. Lorenzaccio, which takes place in Medici's Florence, was set to music by the musician Sylvano Bussotti in 1972. ; Song Bizet set Musset's poem \\"A Une Fleur\\" for voice and piano. Pauline Viardot set Musset's poem \\"Madrid\\" for voice and piano as part of her 6 M√©lodies (1884). The Welsh composer Morfydd Llwyn Owen wrote song settings for Musset's \\"La Tristesse\\" and \\"Chanson de Fortunio\\". Lili Boulanger's Pour les fun√©railles d'un soldat for baritone, mixed chorus and orchestra is a setting of several lines from Act IV of Musset's play La Coupe et les l√®vres. ; Instrumental music Ruggero Leoncavallo's symphonic poem \\"La Nuit de Mai\\" (1886) was based on Musset's poetry. Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco's Cielo di settembre, op. 1 for solo piano (1910) takes its name from a line of Musset's poem \\"A quoi r√™vent les jeunes filles\\". The score, in the original publication, is preceded by that line, \\"Mais vois donc quel beau ciel de septembre‚Ä¶\\" Rebecca Clarke's Viola Sonata (1919) is prefaced by two lines from Musset's La Nuit de Mai. ; Other Shane Briant plays Alfred de Musset in a Masterpiece Theatre production of \\"Notorious Woman\\" in 1974. In 2007, C√©line Dion recorded a song called \\"Lettre de George Sand √† Alfred de Musset\\" for her album D'elles.

A multiple time world champion, this boxer was also known as quite a socialite. Molina is a native of Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Amateur career Molina represented Puerto Rico as a Bantamweight at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. His results were: *1st round bye *Defeated Jarmo Eskelinen (Finland) 5-0 *Lost to Pedro Nolasco (Dominican Republic) 2-3 Molina won the Boxing World Cup in Seoul, South Korea, November 1985, by knocking out Kelcie Banks in the finals. Upon returning to Puerto Rico, the 20-year-old youngster announced to Rafael Bracero on TV he would be ready to fight professional world Featherweight champion Victor Luvi Callejas within a year. That wasn't to happen, however. Pro career Molina started as a professional on February 25, 1986, beating Job Walters by a decision in four. His first three fights were decisions. He won his first 14 bouts, nine of them by knockout. Among the people he beat during that span was Victor Aponte, who was a stablemate of both Alberto Mercado and Juan Carazo. Aponte got knocked out by Molina in the 10th and final round. During this period of his career, Molina received much television exposure in Puerto Rico, many of his fights being shown on TV by producer and fight commentator Ivonne Class and her Video Deportes company. Then, he faced Lupe Suarez, losing for the first time, when he was knocked out in the ninth round. Immediately after suffering his first loss, he embarked on a five-fight win streak, including a disqualification win in four rounds over former Hector Camacho world title challenger Rafael Solis, and a knockout in eight over Miguel Medina. After those two wins, he was ranked as the number one challenger by the IBF. On October 27, 1988, Molina was at The Arco Arena in Sacramento, to challenge the IBF super featherweight champion Tony Lopez, in what marked the beginning of a three-fight rivalry between Molina and Lopez. Molina dropped Lopez in round two, but Lopez went on to retain the title by a split decision. In his next fight, April 29, 1989, the WBO put him and former WBC featherweight champion Juan Laporte against each other for the vacant WBO super featherweight title. Molina became a world champion by beating Laporte by a 12-round unanimous decision at Roberto Clemente Coliseum in San Juan. Then, in September of that year, he returned to Arco Arena to resume his rivalry with Lopez. Molina added the IBF belt to his WBO crown by knocking Lopez out in the tenth round. On January 28, 1990, he avenged his loss to Suarez by knocking him out in the sixth round to retain the belt, but then, on May 20 of that year, he and Lopez met for their rubber match, this time in Reno. Lopez dropped Molina and won a unanimous decision to recover his status as world Jr. Lightweight champion. Between then and 1992, Molina won five straight fights, four by knockout. And so, after Brian Mitchell (who had beaten Lopez), left the IBF title vacant due to retirement, Molina travelled to South Africa, where he met Jackie Gunguzula for the vacant world title. He knocked Gunguzula out in the fourth round to become world champion once again, and, days later, he was the object of a large welcoming at Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in San Juan. During this period of his reign, Molina made seven defenses, beating challengers like Bernard Taylor, Floyd Havard, Wilson Rodriguez, former world Featherweight champion Gregorio Vargas and future world Featherweight champion Manuel \\"Mantecas\\" Medina, among others. Around then, he became quite known by the mainstream Puerto Rican public, becoming one of the first boxers ever to be portrayed on the cover of Vea magazine, and dating a famous model. Molina then moved up in weight to challenge the WBO lightweight champion Oscar De La Hoya, losing by a unanimous decision in 12 rounds in an HBO Boxing televised event. After that, Molina engaged in a series of fights against mostly lower-level opposition for the next two years, and he grew frustrated over the fact that his opposition level was being downgraded by promoters after the fight with de la Hoya. He won his next nine bouts, but the only two opponents that can probably be called respectable names in his list of opponents during that span were Jaime \\"Rocky\\" Balboa, beaten by decision in ten, and Isaac Cruz, beaten by a disqualification in four. On May 9, 1998, Molina was given a second chance at a world lightweight championship, when he met IBF champion Sugar Shane Mosley, in Molina's second HBO fight. Mosley retained the title by a knockout in the eighth round, and Molina went back to the super featherweight division. His next fight was also for the world title, but he had to wait nine months for that fight. In February 1999, he faced IBF super featherweight champion Roberto Garcia, dropping the champion in their pay per view event but losing a 12-round decision in what turned out to be his last world title fight. Molina wasn't done with boxing, and he went on to win seven more fights in a row, including two decision wins that were televised by the USA Network: over Emanuel Burton and future Kostya Tszyu world title challenger Ben Tackie. His last fight was a T.K.O. loss to Mexican Juan Lazcano, Molina retired from boxing after the fight.

Early life Jones was born in Los Angeles, California. His family moved back to North Little Rock, Arkansas in 1945.Dent, Jim. King of the Cowboys: The Life and Times of Jerry Jones, p. 214 (Adams Media Corporation, 1995): \\"Pat Jones moved his family back from Los Angeles to North Little Rock in 1945.\\" Jones' father J.W. \\"Pat\\" Jones (1920-1997) and mother Arminta Pearl Clark Jones (1922-2012) married in 1941. They owned two branches of Pat's Super Market in the Rose City neighborhood of North Little Rock. Jones was a running back at North Little Rock High School, graduating in 1960. After his graduation, Jones' parents moved to Springfield, Missouri, where Pat was president and chairman of Modern Security Life Insurance Co. The company, which an advertisement billed as a \\"one in a million\\" company, saw its assets increase from $440,299.76 in its first statement in 1961 to $6,230,607 in 1965. After graduating from the University of Arkansas, Jerral W. Jones was listed as an executive vice president. With the success of the company, the Joneses assembled the 5,500-acre Buena Vista Ranch east of Springfield in Rogersville, Missouri in the Ozark Mountains. In 1971, after selling the insurance company, the couple carved out 400 acres of their ranch to start Buena Vista Animal Paradise, where tourists could visit exotic animals (now Wild Animal Safari in Strafford, Missouri, just south of Interstate 44). =College football career= Jones attended the University of Arkansas, where he was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity. He was co- captain of the 1964 National Championship football team. He was an all- Southwest Conference offensive lineman for College Football Hall of Fame coach Frank Broyles and a teammate of college football and NFL coach Jimmy Johnson, whom Jones hired as his first head coach after purchasing the Cowboys. Other notable teammates were Glen Ray Hines, a consensus All-American offensive tackle; Ken Hatfield, who went on to coach several major programs including Arkansas; Jim Lindsey; future Outland Trophy winner Loyd Phillips; and College Football Hall of Fame linebacker Ronnie Caveness. Several future head coaches were assistant coaches for Broyles on the Razorbacks' staff during Jones's college career in Fayetteville, including three more members of the College Football Hall of Fame: Hayden Fry (Southern Methodist University, North Texas State University and University of Iowa); Johnny Majors (Iowa State University, University of Pittsburgh and University of Tennessee), and Barry Switzer (University of Oklahoma, and later head coach of the Cowboys under Jones). Jones is one of a very small number of NFL owners who had a significant level of success as a football player.Former Razorback Jerry Jones meets with Arkansas players ‚Äì College Football ‚Äì ESPN.

Business ventures According to an interview with Jones on HBO, after graduating from college in 1965, he borrowed a million dollars from Jimmy Hoffa's Teamsters union to open up a string of Shakey's Pizza Parlor restaurants in Missouri. When that venture failed, Jones was given a job at his father's insurance company Modern Security Life of Springfield, Missouri. He received his master's degree in business in 1970. After several other unsuccessful business ventures (including an attempt, again using Teamsters money, to purchase the American Football League's San Diego Chargers in 1967), he began an oil and gas exploration business in Arkansas, Jones Oil and Land Lease, which became successful.Jerry Jones Sports Biography, Photos & Rise To Success.

In 2008, Jones formed a partnership with Yankee Global Enterprises to create Legends Hospitality, a food, beverage, merchandise, retail and stadium operations corporation serving entertainment venues.Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees form joint concessions venture (The Dallas Morning News) Dallas Cowboys On February 25, 1989, Jones purchased the Cowboys from H.R. \\"Bum\\" Bright for $140 million (equivalent to $292.5 million in 2020). Soon after the purchase, he fired longtime coach Tom Landry, to that point the only coach in the team's history, in favor of his old teammate at Arkansas, Jimmy Johnson. A few months later, he fired longtime general manager Tex Schramm, and assumed complete control over football matters. After a slow start under Jones and Johnson (the first season under Jones, a 1‚Äì15 finish, remains second only to the team's inaugural season in terms of futility), Jones quickly built a team that is often reckoned to be the best NFL franchise of the 1990s. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXVII in the 1992 season, as well as Super Bowl XXVIII the following year in the 1993 season. Johnson then departed and was replaced by Barry Switzer, who also went on to win Super Bowl XXX in the 1995 season. At the time of the sale, the financially troubled Bright claimed to be losing $1 million per month on the franchise. During Jones' tenure, the Cowboys have appreciated in value to an estimated $4.2 billion, turning their owner into a billionaire in the process. Much of the league's financial success since 1989 has been credited to Jones himself. In particular, he was decisive in securing Fox as the NFC's primary broadcaster at a time when the traditional \\"Big Three\\" networks were trying to convince the league into accepting a rollback in television rights fees.New York Daily News. Retrieved on December 11, 2012. Increased television revenues have played a decisive role in securing the NFL's place as the world's richest sports league, with revenues of well over $10 billion per season. The 2018 NFL season was Jones' 30th as Cowboys owner - more than the number of seasons as the combined tenures of his predecessors. =Criticism= GULFSTREAM G-V N1DC Dallas Cowboys owners personal plane at VNY In an online poll from October 8, 2003, Jones was named the least favorite sports personality by Sports Illustrated, in three states (Virginia, Delaware and Texas).Sports Illustrated features state of Virginia in series of 50 state-specific weekly sections, Sportsillustrated.cnn.com, October 9, 2003; retrieved December 21, 2010. Jones is often vilified by fans who remain bitter at his unceremonious firings of long-time Cowboys personnel who were fan favorites, head coach Tom Landry and general manager Tex Schramm, even though the Cowboys had been doing poorly in the last few seasons before Jones became the team owner. Jones stated he did not give consideration to retaining Landry for even a season, as he said he would not have purchased the team unless he could hire Johnson as coach. Jones also did not discuss the matter beforehand with Landry before announcing the decision. This was denounced by football fans and media as totally lacking in class and respect, as pride and tradition were part of the Cowboys where great performance and loyal service were expected to be rewarded. Since the dismissal, Jones has indicated he regrets the process of Landry's firing and his role in it. It would later emerge that Jones' predecessor Bright had been dissatisfied with Landry for years and had even offered to relieve Jones of the inevitable criticism by dismissing the longtime coach himself prior to selling the team. Some of the fan criticism is due to Jones' high visibility and involvement as the \\"face of the team\\", a marked contrast to both Bright and the Cowboys' original owner, Clint Murchison Jr. Jones' prominent role has led to fans expressing their displeasure with Jones and the lack of success of the franchise, with particular criticism focusing on Jones' insistence on serving as his own general manager. There was particular criticism of Jones over his conflict with head coach Jimmy Johnson, as Jones who was general manager \\"wanted Cowboys fans to know he had helped build those Super Bowl-winning teams\\", while \\"Johnson insisted that he made all of the personnel moves\\" since he had the final say in football matters and refused to relinquish this power; consequently Jones ousted Johnson after the 1993 season despite winning two consecutive Super Bowls and has refused to induct Johnson into the Cowboys Ring of Honor. Jones also initially promised head coach Bill Parcells complete control over football matters, however their relationship broke down after Jones signed controversial wide receiver Terrell Owens. Parcell's successor as Cowboys head coach, Wade Phillips, had complained to friends about being \\"undermined and second-guessed, repeatedly\\" by Jones. Jones is one of two owners in the league (the other being Cincinnati's Mike Brown) who have either the title or powers of general manager. Over the years of Jones's tenure, Cowboys fans have organized a number of grassroots efforts aimed at displacing Jones from his position.Fire Jerry Jones!, firejerryjones.com; retrieved December 21, 2010. Jones is the subject of the 2008 book Playing to Win by David Magee. In the book, Jones admitted he handled the firing of Landry poorly and accepted some blame for the disintegration of his relationship with Landry's successor, Jimmy Johnson. Jones became involved in the St. Louis Rams move back to Los Angeles with Stan Kroenke in 2016. He was instrumental in brokering a deal between Stan Kroenke, San Diego Chargers owner Dean Spanos, and Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis to ensure that Kroenke's SoFi Stadium plan passed which it did via a 30-2 owners vote in favor. Jones' support and role in the negotiations has been criticized by some fans and sports media in St. Louis.Sports Day DFW (January 13, 2016). \\"Report: Still an NFL power broker, Cowboys' Jerry Jones helps Rams earn Los Angeles move\\".

Jones made comments both to the press and on his radio show, saying Hochuli was one of the most criticized officials in the NFL. This was Jones' first fine by the NFL.San Diego Union Tribune, September 29, 2008, D14 In 2009, Jones was fined $100,000 for violating a gag order on labor issues, commenting that revenue sharing was \\"on its way out\\". Commissioner Roger Goodell had issued a gag order for all owners and team executives from discussing any aspect of the pending labor issues. Jones \\"crossed the line\\", drawing a \\"six-figure\\" fine, sources said, as the commissioner distributed a memo to all 32 owners, along with a reminder that the gag order remains in effect.

However, its independence, like the other Bantustans (Ciskei, Transkei and Venda) was not recognized by any country other than South Africa. Bophuthatswana was the second Bantustan to be declared an independent state, after Transkei. Its territory constituted a scattered patchwork of enclaves spread across what was then Cape Province, Orange Free State and Transvaal. Its seat of government was Mmabatho, which is now a suburb of Mahikeng. On 27 April 1994, it was reintegrated into South Africa with the coming into force of the country's interim constitution. Its territory was distributed between the new provinces of the Free State, Gauteng and North West Province.

It's the price we are prepared to pay for being masters of our own destiny.\\" United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim stated that he \\"strongly deplored\\" the establishment of \\"another so-called independent tribal homeland in pursuance of the discredited policies of apartheid,\\" and in resolution A/RES/32/105N, passed on 14 December 1977, the United Nations General Assembly linked Bophuthatswana's \\"so-called 'independence'\\" to South Africa's \\"stubborn pursuit\\" of its policies, and called upon all governments to \\"deny any form of recognition to the so-called 'independent' bantustans.\\" During a parliamentary debate in the UK on 6 December 1977, Foreign Secretary David Owen replied in the negative when asked \\"whether Her Majesty's Government intend to recognise travel documents issued by the authorities of [...] Bophuthatswana for the purpose of admitting visitors to the United Kingdom.\\" While the majority of news reports echoed these official declarations, there were others which opined that Western critics should \\"suspend judgment for a time,\\"Kilpatrick, James.

The Israeli Foreign Ministry objected to the embassy's presence, as Israel did not recognize Bophuthatswana as a country. The bantustan's president, Lucas Mangope, was nevertheless able to meet with prominent figures such as Moshe Dayan during visits to Israel.The Unspoken Alliance: Israel's Secret Relationship with Apartheid South Africa , Sasha Polakow-Suransky, Pantheon Books, New York, 2010, page 157. In the 1982 elections, the Democratic Party won all 72 elected seats. It also won a large majority in the 1987 elections. =Series of coups d'√©tat= On 10 February 1988 Rocky Malebane-Metsing of the People's Progressive Party (PPP) became the President of Bophuthatswana for one day when he took over the government through a military coup. He accused Mangope of corruption and charged that the recent election had been rigged in the government's favour. A statement by the defence force said \\"serious and disturbing matters of great concern\\" had emerged, citing Mangope's close association with a multimillionaire Soviet emigre.South Africa Quells Coup Attempt in a Homeland , The New York Times, 11 February 1988 Subsequently, the South African Defence Force invaded Bophuthatswana and Mangope was reinstated and continued his term unabated. P. W. Botha, president of South Africa at the time, justified the reinstatement by saying that \\"[t]he South African Government is opposed in principle to the obtaining or maintaining of power by violence.\\" In 1990, a second coup attempt took place in which an estimated 50,000 protesters demanded the president's resignation over his handling of the economy. The New York Times reported that seven people had been killed and 450 wounded \\"after police officers in armoured cars fired their rifles into the crowds and used tear gas and rubber bullets.\\" After Mangope had asked for help from the South African government, he declared a state of emergency and cut telephone links to the territory \\"for political reasons,\\" claiming that \\"normal laws had become inadequate.\\"TURMOIL SPREADS TO 2D 'HOMELAND' , The New York Times, 8 March 1990 Human Rights Watch put the number of protesters at 150,000.Human Rights Watch World Report 1990 - South Africa , published 1 January 1991 =Crisis of 1994= In the beginning of 1994 with South Africa heading for democratic elections, the President Lucas Mangope resisted the elections taking place in Bophuthatswana and opposed reincorporation of the territory into South Africa. This resulted in increasing unrest and 40 people were wounded when Bophuthatswana Defence Force troops opened fire on striking civil servants.

With unrest growing and rumors of ANC supporters massing at Bophuthatswana's borders, Mangope invited General Constand Viljoen, head of the right-wing Afrikaner Volksfront, to immediately assist in keeping the peace. The Afrikaners were hastily rallied and mobilised, including the white supremacist group Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), which took the opportunity to move in and try to restore the apartheid status quo. Uniformed members of the AWB on an armed incursion to the Mmabatho/Mafikeng area shot at unarmed civilians blocking the road, injuring and killing many. They themselves were shot at by members of the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) and the Police and forced to retreat. One member of the AWB travelling back in a blue Mercedes Benz shot at some people along the road, which was then followed by members of the Bophuthatswana police opening fire at the car. The driver, Nicolaas Fourie, and his two passengers promptly surrendered and were disarmed. After the media were allowed to photograph the badly injured prisoners, they were then executed at point-blank range by a Bophuthatswana policeman, Ontlametse Bernstein Menyatsoe. These killings effectively spelt the end of white right-wing military opposition to democratic reforms. On 12 March 1994, Mangope was deposed as President of Bophuthatswana by the South African Government and the Transitional Executive Council. South African Ambassador to Bophuthatswana, Prof.Tjaart van der Walt, was then appointed as the territory's new administrator. =Dissolution= With the end of apartheid after the first multi-racial elections and the coming into force of the Interim Constitution of South Africa on 27 April 1994, Bophuthatswana ceased to exist and once again became part of South Africa. The 7 enclaves that formed the country were absorbed into the North West Province, Gauteng and the Free State. The capital, Mmabatho, was merged with Mafikeng and the combined city is now the capital of the North-West province. Geography Bophuthatswana in 1977 =Territory= Bophuthatswana had a surface area of approximately 40 000 km2 (17,000 sq. mi.) and consisted of seven enclaves dispersed over the former South African provinces of Cape Province, Transvaal, and Orange Free State. Six of the enclaves were located relatively close together with three in the Cape Province and another three in Transvaal. The seventh enclave was in the Orange Free State between Bloemfontein and the Lesotho border. One of the enclaves shared a border with Botswana, while two of the enclaves were located near Pretoria and its surrounding industrial areas. The townships in these enclaves, such as Ga-Rankuwa and Mabopane continued to serve as dormitory townships for the supply of labour (as they had done prior to Bophuthatswana's independence) despite being located in Bophuthatswana territory. Other enclaves were similarly located near South African cities such as Rustenburg and Bloemfontein. The capital, Mmabatho, was situated in the enclave bordering Botswana. The territory and borders of the country were fluid as the South African government frequently incorporated territory into the country. As a result, when independence was declared in 1977, the country originally consisted of six enclaves but just before its reincorporation into South Africa, it had seven enclaves. Another example was the incorporation of Mafeking, which was located just outside the borders of Bophuthatswana when it gained independence in 1977, into the country in 1980 after a local referendum. =Districts and cities= Districts of Bophuthatswana and their population in 1991 are: * Odi: 354,782 * Moretele: 235,540 * Tlhaping-Tlharo: 101,425 * Ditsobotla: 135,045 * Molopo: 128,383 * Mankwe: 89,841 * Bafokeng: 88,399 * Taung: 134,277 * Thaba 'Nchu: 49,053 * Lehurutshe: 62,901 * Madikwe: 52,268 * Ganyesa: 47,036 Major cities and towns in Bophuthatswana include: *Ga-Rankuwa *Mabopane *Mafikeng *Mmabatho - the capital *Mogwase *Temba *Tlhabane Demographics The homeland was set up to house Setswana-speaking peoples. In 1983, it had more than 1,430,000 inhabitants; in 1990, it had an estimated population of 2,352,296.\\"1990 CIA World Factbook \\". Central Intelligence Agency. Retrieved on 2008-08-19. Only 10% of Bophuthatswana's total land area was arable, and much of that was covered with scrub brush. Though the majority of its population was Tswana- speaking, Tswana, English, and Afrikaans were all designated as official languages by the constitution.Constitution of Bophuthatswana , as revised in 1984, Chapter 1, 5. Economy Bophuthatswana was the richest of the TBVC- states as it had platinum mines, which accounted for two-thirds of the total platinum production in the Western world. It was also rich in asbestos, granite, vanadium, chromium and manganese. Additional revenues came from the Sun City casino, which was a day trip from Johannesburg and Pretoria, where gambling was illegal under the National Party government, as it was throughout all of South Africa. Bophuthatswana also issued bearer development bonds. The so-called \\"Bop Bonds\\" are not recognized or redeemable in South Africa, and are worthless as financial instruments. However, bonds in excellent condition are considered collectible. Bonds issued in 1988 and 1989, in R10 and R20 denominations, currently trade at 10-25% of original face value. Security forces Flag of the BDF Towards the end of its existence, the Bophuthatswana Defence Force (BDF) had an estimated number of 4,000 troops, mostly infantry. It was organized into six military regions, and its ground forces included two infantry battalions, possessing two armoured personnel carriers. The Bophuthatswana Air Force of 150 personnel possessed three combat aircraft and two armed helicopters. The president was commander-in-chief and was authorised to deploy the armed forces in both cross-border operations as well as domestically.Constitution of the Republic of Bophuthatswana as amended in 1984, Chapter 3, 20.(2)(a) During its last days in 1994, the Bophuthatswana Police had 6,002 police officers, operating from 56 police stations throughout the territory.'Policing Agencies: 1994, Prior to Amalgamation: South Africa' . Website of the South African Police Service. With the dissolution of Bophuthatswana in 1994, the BDF and the Bophuthatswana Police were incorporated into the South African National Defence Force and the South African Police Service, respectively.

It is situated east of Rottumeroog and west of Juist. Geography Island location (left) Island map Borkum is bordered to the west by the Westerems strait (which forms the border with the Netherlands), to the east by the Osterems strait, to the north by the North Sea, and to the south by the Wadden Sea. It is the largest and westernmost of the East Frisian Islands in the North Sea, due north of the Dutch province of Groningen. The island was formed in 1863 by two previously separate islands which were still separated by a shallow water. The seam between the former eastern and western parts is called T√ºskend√∂r (\\"through in between\\"). = Climate = Borkum is the only East Frisian island that is under the influence of the North Sea all year round thanks to its 30 km distance from the mainland. The maritime climate is influenced by the Gulf Stream and the west wind zone with correspondingly high humidity throughout the year. This ensures varied weather with much sun and wind but also occasional rain and showers. Compared to the mainland, there is a climate with much milder winters and cooler summers without extremely cold or hot days. This is due to the buffering effect of the sea, which warms up slowly in spring and summer, but stores the warm temperatures longer in autumn. History Mentioned as Burchana fabaria (island of beans) by both Strabo and Pliny the elder, Borkum by the time of Charlemagne was part of a larger island called Bant, which consisted of the present day islands of Borkum, Juist, and the western part of Norderney. In 1484, Bant passed to the Earls of East Frisia, who developed trade, and the island became known as a centre of piracy and whaling. By 1781, violent storms in the 18th century divided Bant into three islands. As whaling decreased, the inhabitants became impoverished, and many left, with the island's population falling from 852 in 1776 to 406 by 1811. The first tourists arrived on the island in 1834, and the local economy improved as a tourist resort. In Mexico as I saw it, published by Thomas Nelson, Mrs Alec Tweedie, writing in 1911 about a trip of 1900 to Mexico, compares the brick roads of Monterrey with those of Borkum, \\"the one spot on earth from which Jews are banished\\". This had to do with the aggressive and successful campaign of German tourists to keep Borkum free from Jewish visitors, as celebrated in the antisemitic \\"Borkum-Lied\\". In 1910, British officers Captain Bernard Frederick Trench and Lieutenant Vivian H. Brandon were imprisoned for espionage for photographing the military installations on the island. On 19 and 20 December 1934, Wernher von Braun launched \\"Max\\" and \\"Moritz\\", the two prototypes of the A2-rocket. The island was the site of Nazi war crimes later prosecuted in the Borkum Island war crimes trial. Transport The island is partially car-free. Off-season, driving by car is permitted everywhere, otherwise there are car-free zones. The only town on the island is also called Borkum. There is an airfield in the T√ºskend√∂r area. Borkum is served by ferries from Emden, Germany and Eemshaven, the Netherlands. The Borkumer Kleinbahn narrow-gauge railway connects the harbour and the town of Borkum.

Shopping days and impact of holidays Some countries, particularly those with predominantly Christian populations or histories, do not allow Sunday shopping. In Islamic countries some shops are closed on Fridays for noontime prayers. In Israel many shops are closed on Friday evenings and Saturdays during the daytime for Shabbat (the Jewish Sabbath). Each state in Australia sets its own standard trading hours, but in most of the country the shops are open seven days a week for at least part of the day. For some shops and other businesses in culturally Christian countries, Christmas Day is the only day in the year that they are closed. In the United States and Canada, nearly all retail stores are open every day of the year except for Thanksgiving, Christmas Day, and Easter Sunday. Some suburban and smaller communities often close on Sundays. For example, Bergen County, New Jersey, next to New York City, completely bans Sunday shopping. Nearly all stores in the United States have restricted hours on Sundays (most often 11 am or noon to 5 - 7 pm), and stores close early on important holidays, such as Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, and Independence Day. Banks, post offices and other government offices either are closed on weekends, or close early on Saturdays. Many other non-retail establishments remain closed on weekends. In Islamic countries shops may have special opening hours during Ramadan. In Israel, many shops are closed on religious holidays other than Shabbat, especially on Yom Kippur when nearly all businesses are closed. Australia Shop trading hours in Australia are regulated by individual states and territories. The Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, totally or almost totally deregulate shopping hours. All retail businesses in the two territories, regardless of size or product offer, are allowed to decide their trading hours to suit their individual customer demand. Non-essential shops in the three states are required to remain closed on Christmas Day and Good Friday, ANZAC Day (until 1pm), and in Tasmania and NSW on Easter Sunday, and in NSW on Boxing Day (outside the Sydney special trading precinct). Shops in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory can remain open on any public holiday. The two main supermarket operators, Woolworths and Coles, generally trade between 6 am and midnight every day, although some inner-city shops in Sydney and Melbourne operate twenty-four hours. In Canberra, Woolworths, Kmart and a few more shops open 24/7. Melbourne generally has the most relaxed rules. Almost all shopping centres in Melbourne now trade until 9pm on Thursdays and Fridays as well as being open longer hours on Sundays. Interstate late night trading only occurs on either Thursday or Friday rather than both. Melbourne is also famous for beginning the trend of 36-hour overnight trades in the lead-up to Christmas. Some of the larger shopping centres will open from 8 am December 23 until 6 pm on Christmas Eve. Centres often open to 10pm or midnight on most other nights in the fortnight before Christmas, and the first few days of the annual Boxing Day Sales. Trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory have been deregulated since the repeal of the Trading Hours Act 1996 [ACT] on 29 May 1997. Shopping hours in South Australia are still regulated, but there have been numerous changes to relax the laws. Nonetheless, trading laws are still face complicated and confusing: legal trading hours vary depending on size and product offer. Supermarkets that trade with fewer than seven workers and with a trading floor less than 500 m2 are exempt from the laws. Larger supermarkets are required by law to close at 9 pm on Mondays to Fridays, and 5 pm on Saturdays; they are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11am to 5pm, except ANZAC Day, which is 12 noon to 5pm; they must remain closed on Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. In all areas of Queensland, trading hours of major supermarkets are Monday to Saturday from 7am to 9pm and Sundays and public holidays from 9am to 6pm. Most major shopping centres close at 5pm every day, except for \\"late night shopping\\" on one night a week. Supermarkets in major shopping centres must still cease trading at 9pm, with special access for just the supermarket. In rural areas of Western Australia below the 27th parallel, local governments nominate shop closing hours to the State government, which, if accepted, are implemented by ministerial order. Shopping hours in the state's capital, Perth, are regulated by laws similar to South Australia's. Trading hours are stipulated in law, and are based on size and product offer. As in South Australia, smaller, independently operated supermarket retailers are exempted. Chain supermarkets are required to close Monday to Friday at 9pm, Saturdays at 5pm, and are permitted to trade on Sundays and public holidays only from 11am to 5pm. Austria A convenience store at a Vienna train station selling Reiseproviant (travel provisions), the usual code for expanded opening hours The situation in Austria is very similar to that in Germany, with most public holidays being based on Catholic holidays as the country is predominantly Roman Catholic. Until the 1990s, all shops closed around noon on Saturday and did not reopen until Monday morning. Entrepreneurs such as Richard Lugner lobbied for an expansion of shopping hours, and laws are gradually being changed, with more and more exceptions granted. Meanwhile, as in Germany, gas stations and train stations in big cities have taken on the role of Nahversorger (\\"local providers\\", supplying the local population with groceries) outside regular shopping hours. Until very recently, shopping hours remained very restrictive. In 2008 Austria modified its 2003 √ñffnungszeitengesetz (\\"opening times law\\"). The new regulations allow stores to open from 6:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. on weekdays, and on Saturday until 6:00 p.m. but they are restricted to a total of 72 open hours per week. Bakeries can open 30 minutes earlier at 5:30 a.m. Shops are closed on Sunday, but there are exceptions for tourist locations, train stations, airports, and the Christmas season. Canada Store hours in Canada are regulated by each province or territory and, in some provinces, individual municipalities as well. As a general rule, there is little regulation of shopping hours across the country. In the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan, as well as all three territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut), there are no restrictions at all and stores can open 24/7 every day. Nova Scotia permits any store to open every day of the year except Remembrance Day (November 11). The remaining provinces (Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador) require stores to close on most major holidays. Furthermore, three provinces have further restrictions on Sunday openings. In Manitoba, stores may open on Sundays only with municipal approval and only between 9am - 6 pm (although exceptions for essential services apply). New Brunswick allows Sunday opening all year only with both municipal and provincial approval; otherwise it is permitted only from August until the New Year. Some communities in New Brunswick (such as Woodstock, Miramichi, Sussex) restrict Sunday hours of operation to 12pm - 5pm. The province of Quebec is the only province in Canada that regulates shopping hours outside of Sundays and holidays. As a general rule, stores are permitted to open only between 8am and 9pm weekdays and 8am - 5pm weekends, excluding holidays. There are several exceptions, however, notably several supermarkets in Montreal, which are open later hours or 24 hours a day. In practice, few stores in Canada (except a few grocery stores) remain open 24 hours. Most shopping centres open from 10am-9pm Monday to Friday, 9:30am - 6pm (or in some cases 9pm) on Saturday and 12pm - 5pm or 6pm on Sunday. Many larger stores, such as Walmart Canada, and most major grocery stores remain open 8am - 10pm Monday to Saturday and 10am - 6pm (in some provinces 8 am-10 pm) on Sunday, except in provinces where further restrictions apply. The Sobeys chain stays open from 7am - 11pm on weekdays and Saturdays, though some locations are open twenty-four hours. Many Loblaws brand stores such as Zehrs Markets and Real Canadian Superstore are open from 7am-11pm, 7 days a week. China Trading hours in China, including Hong Kong and Macau special administrative regions, are commercial decisions and are not regulated. Most shops are open on public holidays. Some convenience stores are open twenty- four hours and every day of the year, but only a few large supermarkets are open twenty-four hours a day. During the Chinese New Year, many shops in China close for a few days, from Chinese New Year's Eve to the first day of the Chinese New Year. Or more often, to the third day of the Chinese New Year. Some shops in Hong Kong and Macau operate on Chinese New Year holidays, especially supermarket chains. Croatia Shopping hours in Croatia are currently unregulated after the Constitutional Court struck down a ban on Sunday shopping, which had been in effect from mid-2008 until mid-2009. Most large out-of-town supermarkets are open between 07:30/08:00-21:00/22:00, Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls usually open at 09:00 and also close at 22:00, every day. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, typically at 13:00. Other shops in urban areas are generally closed on Sundays. Bakeries and newspaper kiosks often open very early in the morning, at 05:30 or 06:00, and open every day but not twenty-four hours. Gas stations and convenience stores along major roads as well as some pharmacies (at least one in each major city, five in Zagrebhttp://www.gljz.hr/templates/radnaHrv.asp?sifraStranica=362 ) operate twenty-four hours. Denmark Standard operating hours for most businesses are generally 8:00/8:30 - 17:30. Since 1 October 2012, Danish shops have been allowed to be open every day around the clock, except on public holidays and after 3 pm on Christmas Eve's Day and New Year Eve's Day. Shops with a turnover of less than DKK 32.2 million (2012 figure, indexed) are allowed to be open every day of the year. Still in many small towns shops are usually closed on Saturday after 2 pm and on Sunday. Some small shops are closed on Monday. Finland Sunday shopping was first introduced in 1994. In 1989 shops were allowed to be open on Sundays in sparsely populated areas. In the autumn of 1994 the law was extended to apply to the conurbanations i.e. densely populated areas, but only in December and on six specifically designated Sundays. In 1997 it was legislated that the grocery shops could be open on Sundays during the whole summer. At the same time the closing hour was set at later; 21:00. In 2000 small markets ‚Äî less than 400 m2 in sales area ‚Äî were encouraged to be open on Sundays all year around, with the exception of four days. Also the legislation concerning (super)markets bigger than 400 m2 in sales area was clarified by discarding the law of six designated Sundays and replacing it with Sunday opening hours from May to August and from November to December. On 15 December 2015, the Finnish parliament voted to remove all opening hour restrictions for all retailers. The law came into effect on 1 January 2016. Many stores are open every day. Larger supermarkets and hypermarkets are open from 7:00 or 8:00 to 21:00 or 22:00, and smaller shops from 10:00 to 18:00 or 19:00. The only stores with regulated hours are the nationally owned Alko alcohol shops, which are open from 9:00 to 21:00 on weekdays and 9:00 to 18:00 on Sundays. Germany In Germany, shopping days and opening hours were previously regulated by a federal law called the \\"Shop Closing Law\\" (Ladenschlussgesetz), first enacted in 1956 and last revised on 13 March 2003. On 7 July 2006, however, the federal government handed over the authority to regulate shopping hours to the sixteen states (L√§nder). Since then, states have been allowed to pass their own laws regulating opening hours. The federal Ladenschlussgesetz still applies in Bavaria and Saarland, which have not passed their own laws. Under this law, shops may not open prior to 6 am and may not stay open later than 8 p.m. from Monday to Saturday. Shops must also stay closed on Sundays and public holidays (both federal and state), and special rules apply concerning Christmas Eve (December 24) should that day fall on a weekday. There are several exceptions, including petrol stations and shops located in railway stations and airports, which may stay open past the normal hours. Most petrol stations in larger cities, and all situated on Autobahns, are open twenty-four hours. Shops in so-called \\"tourist zones\\" may also open outside the normal hours, but they are restricted to selling souvenirs, handcrafted articles and similar tourist items. In connection with fairs and public market days, communities are allowed four days per year (normally Sundays) on which shops may open outside the normal restrictions; such shop openings may not take place during primary church services and they must close by 6 pm. Bakeries may open for business at 5.30 am and may also open for a limited time on Sundays. Restaurants, bars, theatres, and cultural establishments are generally unaffected by the shop opening time restrictions. As most public holidays in Germany are religiously based, and since the religious holidays (Protestant and Catholic) are not uniform across Germany, shops may be closed due to a public holiday in one state, and open in a neighbouring state. Bavaria even differentiates between cities with Protestant or Catholic majorities. The Ladenschlussgesetz has been the subject of controversy, as larger stores (and many of their customers) would prefer to have fewer restrictions on shopping hours, while trade unions, small shop owners and the church are opposed to a further loosening of the rules. On June 9, 2004, the German supreme court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) rejected a claim by the German department store chain Kaufhof AG that the shop-closing law was unconstitutional. Among other things, the court cited Article 140 of the German constitution (Grundgesetz) (which in turn invokes Article 139 of the 1919 Weimar Constitution) protecting Sundays and public holidays as days of rest and recuperation. Nonetheless, the court in effect invited the federal parliament (Bundestag) to reconsider whether the states should regulate hours instead of the federal government. So far, no state has passed a regulation that allows general store opening on Sundays. States with no restrictions from Monday to Saturday and varying regulations for Sunday: *Baden-W√ºrttemberg *Berlin *Brandenburg *Bremen *Hamburg *Hesse *Lower Saxony *Schleswig-Holstein States with no restrictions from Monday to Friday and varying regulations for Saturday and Sunday: *Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania *North Rhine-Westphalia *Saxony-Anhalt *Thuringia States where shops can open between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. from Monday to Saturday; regulations for Sunday vary: *Rhineland- Palatinate *Saxony States with no liberalisation of opening hours exceeding the federal Ladenschlussgesetz: *Bavaria *Saarland Ireland Shops in Ireland may, with few exceptions (such as those involved in the sale of alcohol), open whenever they want, including Sundays and public holidays. Here are typical hours: Monday - Wednesday, Friday, Saturday: *8:00/9:00/10:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00 Thursday: *8:00/9:00/10:00 - 20:00/21:00/22:00 Sunday: *9:00/10:00/11:00 - 17:00/18:00/19:00 Many supermarkets are open twenty-four hours or have longer opening hours (like 8:00 - 22:00) everyday. Large shopping centres and out-of-town (suburban) centres are typically open longer hours everyday (e.g. 09:00 - 21:00/22:00 weekdays, 09:00 - 19:00 Saturdays, 10:00 - 19:00 Sundays). In the two weeks running up to Christmas, it is common for many shops to have extended opening hours; some may operate twenty-four hours until midnight on Christmas Eve. Most shops (other than petrol stations or convenience stores) in smaller towns and villages don't open at all on Sundays. Almost all shops (again, petrol stations, convenience stores, etc. excepted) are closed on Christmas Day, though most are open on all other holidays. Convenience stores, petrol stations and some chemists (drugstores) are normally open from early morning (05:00/06:00/07:00) to the late night (22:00/23:00/00:00), or often twenty-four hours, and New Year's Day is also Sunday hours. In rural areas or in traditional trades, Wednesdays may be a half-day for businesses, closing at 12:30, but this practice has long passed in urban areas. Alcohol is allowed to be sold only between 10:30 and 22:00 from Monday to Saturday and 12:30 to 22:00 on Sundays, but this does not affect opening hours (supermarkets will often block access to alcoholic products outside of these times). Alcohol cannot be sold at all on Good Friday. Japan In Japan, most shops open at 10:00, and close at 20:00 (8 pm). Banks are open from 09:00-15:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends; post offices are open from 09:00-17:00 on weekdays, and closed on weekends. Convenience stores are open round the clock. Mexico In Mexico City, in large shopping centers, stores are generally open from 11 A.M. to 8 P.M., and on Sundays from 11 A.M. to 8 P.M. Restaurant and cinema hours are different, as are those of independent shops and markets.Centro Santa Fe official site[tiendeo.com Tiendeo Mexico (shopping meta-site)] Netherlands Regular opening hours are Monday 11:00 - 18:00; Tuesday-Friday: 09:30 - 18:00; Saturday: 09:30 - 17:00; Sunday (Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Almere, Leiden and smaller tourist towns): 12:00 - 18:00. In many other towns shops are open every first Sunday of the month (koopzondag). Shops are allowed to stay open until 22:00 from Monday to Saturday. Except in busy tourist areas, in or near railway stations, or for big box retailers such as Media Markt, most close at 18:00 on weekdays, and 17:00 on Saturdays, unlike Germany where retailers have taken fuller advantage of liberalization laws and most stay open till at least 19:30. Many supermarkets (including outlets of the market leader Albert Heijn, several DIY stores and IKEA) stay open until 20:00, 21:00 or 22:00. Most towns have their weekly shopping evening (koopavond), when shops stay open until 21:00, on Thursday or Friday. In touristic towns (like Amsterdam's city centre) supermarkets are allowed to open on Sundays between 07:00 and 22:00. Many towns have one or more supermarkets (avondwinkels) that are open until later in the evening, occasionally all night. Convenience stores also have longer shopping hours; they are at many larger railway stations (\\"Albert Heijn to go\\") and in some busy streets. A regular size supermarket that is open until midnight seven days a week is the Albert Heijn at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam (in the landside area of the airport, not just for air travelers). On public holidays, shops that close on Sundays are usually also closed, and other shops tend to have Sunday opening hours. On Christmas Day and New Year's Eve almost all shops are closed. For specific opening hours (openingstijden) in the Netherlands there are several websites. Serbia Shopping hours in Serbia are unregulated. Large supermarkets are usually open from 07:00/07:30/08:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Shopping malls open at 09:00 or 10:00 and also stay open until 22:00. Smaller supermarkets close earlier on Sundays, at 15:00 or 16:00. Unlike neighbouring Croatia, many fast food outlets, bakeries, kiosks and convenience stores in urban areas operate twenty-four hours. Even some hypermarkets, like Tempo and Metro, are open twenty-four hours. Singapore Shopping hours for shopping malls are usually from 10:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Sunday. Automotive shops like tire outlets are usually from 09.30 to 19:00. Some supermarkets are open twenty-four hours. Most stores do not open on the first day of Chinese New Year because of low demand patronage. Sweden In Sweden there is no longer any law regarding shopping hours except for the nationally owned Systembolaget alcohol shops, which close at 20:00 at the latest on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays no alcohol is sold at all, although it is served in restaurants. Shopping centres and food shops are generally open every day; grocery stores often until 22:00 all days of the week and shopping centers usually until 20:00 on weekdays and 18:00 on weekends. Usually shopping centers are closed on New Year's Day, Midsummer's Day and Christmas Day, but grocery stores are open even those days albeit fewer hours than usual. Although there aren't any law that regulate business hours in general, labour laws do not allow work between midnight and 5 am in many professions including grocery stores and most shops. Switzerland Shopping hours are governed by cantonal law and vary accordingly, the only confederally mandated store holiday being August 1 (the national holiday), as per article 110 III of the Swiss Constitution. Most often, stores will be open from 8 or 9 am to 7 or 8 pm, 9 pm one day a week (usually a Thursday or a Friday) depending on the region. On Saturday and the day before public holidays, most stores close at around 4 or 5 pm. Stores are also generally closed on Sundays; see Sunday shopping in Switzerland. United Kingdom In Great Britain, many retail stores are open every day. Some large supermarkets are open for twenty-four hours, (except on Sundays in England and Wales). Most stores do not open on Easter Sunday, New Year's Day or Christmas Day and have reduced hours on other public and bank holidays. Typical store shopping hours: Mondays - Saturdays: 9:00 am to 5:30 pm, or 10:00 am to 8:00 pm/10:00 pm. Sundays: - 10:00 am to 4:00 pm, or 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, or 12 noon to 6:00 pm. Sunday shopping has become more popular, and most but not all shops in towns and cities are open for business. Shops 280 m2 and larger in England and Wales are allowed to trade for only six hours on Sundays; shops in Northern Ireland may open from 1:00 pm to 6:00 pm. In Scotland, in theory, Sunday is considered the same as any other day, and there are no restrictions. In practice, however, some shops do not open on Sunday or open for only four hours in smaller towns. In some Free Church dominated areas, for example Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Sunday is considered a day of rest and consequently very few if any shops open at all. United States A CVS/pharmacy in New York City that is open 24/7, but remains closed on Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas Day In the U.S., the various levels of government generally do not regulate the hours of the vast majority of retailers (though there are exceptions, such as the blue law), and with the main exception being shops licensed to sell spirits and other alcoholic beverages (for shopping hours, see alcohol sale hours by state) and car dealerships. Shopping hours vary widely based on management considerations and customer needs. Key variables are the size of the metropolitan area, the type of store, and the size of the store. Las Vegas, Nevada is the notable exception to all the traditions just described. Las Vegas is world-famous for its 24-hour local culture since it is an area with large gaming and tourism industries that operate 24/7. Since many of the employees in the city's primary industries work overnight shifts -- and because Nevada has few laws in regard to operating hours for any type of commercial activity -- many businesses cater to such workers. Thus, Las Vegas is home to many 24-hour car dealerships, dental clinics, auto mechanics, computer shops, and even some smaller clothing stores. Typical store shopping hours: * Monday - Saturday 9 - 10 a.m. to 8 - 10 p.m. (9:00 - 10:00 to 20:00 - 22:00) * Sunday 11 - 12 noon to 5 - 7 p.m. (11:00 - 12:00 to 17:00 - 19:00) Supermarkets usually open at earlier hours, between 6 or 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. (7:00 - 22:00) every day. Boutiques and smaller shops often close early at 5 or 6 p.m. (17:00 or 18:00), and usually close once or twice a week, most often on Sunday. Nearly all stores are closed on Easter, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In recent years, however, several department stores and discount stores have started opening during the evening on Thanksgiving Day; see Black Friday for more details. Early closing (half days) occur on Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. Some stores might have reduced hours on other major holidays. All malls and department stores, as well as most other stores remain open longer hours between Thanksgiving weekend and Christmas Eve for Christmas and holiday shopping. Many are open until 11 p.m. (23:00), and a few even longer. Few stores remain open twenty- four hours; the main exceptions to this rule are most Walmarts throughout the country (especially Supercenters, which combine a discount store and full supermarket); many convenience stores, especially those that also sell motor fuel; and some drug stores like CVS, especially in larger cities like New York City and Las Vegas. Some stores, especially in suburban and rural areas, might remain closed on Sundays for any reason (such as most retail in Bergen County, New Jersey due to the blue law, which is next to New York City, and home to four major malls and has the largest retail in the nation).

It was first described in a spoof scientific paper titled \\"The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline\\" in 1948. The major peculiarity of the chemical is its \\"endochronicity\\": it starts dissolving before it makes contact with water. Asimov went on to write three additional short stories, each describing different properties or uses of thiotimoline. Chemical properties In Asimov's writings the endochronicity of thiotimoline is explained by the fact that in the thiotimoline molecule, there is at least one carbon atom such that, while two of the carbon's four chemical bonds lie in normal space and time, one of the bonds projects into the future and another into the past. Thiotimoline is derived from the bark of the (fictitious) shrub Rosacea karlsbadensis rugo, and the thiotimoline molecule includes at least fourteen hydroxy groups, two amino groups, and one sulfonic acid group, and possibly one nitro compound group as well. The nature of the hydrocarbon nucleus is unknown, although it seems in part to be an aromatic hydrocarbon. Background In 1947 Asimov was engaged in doctoral research in chemistry and, as part of his experimental procedure, he needed to dissolve catechol in water. As he observed the crystals dissolve as soon as they hit the water's surface, it occurred to him that if catechol were any more soluble, then it would dissolve before it encountered the water. By that time Asimov had been writing professionally for nine years and would soon write a doctoral dissertation. He feared that the experience of writing readable prose for publication might have impaired his ability to write the turgid prose typical of academic discourse, and decided to practice with a spoof article (including charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles in nonexistent journals) describing experiments on a compound, thiotimoline, that was so soluble that it dissolved in water up to 1.12 seconds before the water was added. Asimov wrote the article on 8 June 1947, but was uncertain as to whether the resulting work of fiction was publishable. John W. Campbell, the editor of Astounding Science Fiction accepted it for publication on 10 June, agreeing to Asimov's request that it appear under a pseudonym in deference to Asimov's concern that he might alienate potential doctoral examiners at Columbia University if he were revealed as the author. Some months later Asimov was alarmed to see the piece appear in the March 1948 issue of Astounding under his own name, and copies of the issue circulated at the Columbia chemistry department. Asimov believed that Campbell had done so out of greater wisdom. His examiners told him that they accepted his dissertation by asking a final question about thiotimoline, resulting in him having to be led from the room while laughing hysterically with relief. The article made Asimov famous for the first time outside science fiction, as chemists shared copies of the article. He heard that many children went to the New York Public Library trying to find the nonexistent journals. \\"The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline\\" In 1952, Asimov wrote a second spoof scientific paper on thiotimoline called \\"The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline\\". Like the first, it included charts, graphs, tables, and citations of fake articles from fake journals (along with one real citation: Asimov's own earlier spoof article from Astounding, which was listed tongue- in-cheek as the Journal of Astounding Science Fiction). This second article described the use of thiotimoline to establish a quantitative classification of \\"certain mental disorders\\". It also expounds a putative rationale for thiotimoline's behaviour: namely that the chemical bonds in the compound's structural formula are so starved of space that some are forced into the time dimension. According to the second article, thiotimoline's time of solubility varies depending on the determination of the person adding the water. It also claims that one effect is that when people with multiple personalities add the water, some parts of the thiotimoline dissolve before others, due to some of the individual's personalities being more determined than others. \\"The Micropsychiatric Applications of Thiotimoline\\" appeared in the December 1953 issue of Astounding. The first two thiotimoline \\"articles\\" appeared together in Asimov's first collection of science essays, Only a Trillion (1957), under the joint title \\"The Marvellous Properties of Thiotimoline\\". Asimov also included the original article in his 1972 collection The Early Asimov. The first article also appeared in Fifty Years of the Best Science Fiction from Analog (Davis Publications, 1982). \\"Thiotimoline and the Space Age\\" Asimov wrote a third thiotimoline article on 14 November 1959 called \\"Thiotimoline and the Space Age\\". Instead of a fake scientific paper, this third article took the form of an address by Asimov to the 12th annual meeting of the American Chronochemical Society, a nonexistent scientific society. In his address, Asimov \\"describes\\" his first experiments with thiotimoline in July 1947, and timing the compound's dissolution with the original endochronometer, \\"the same instrument now at the Smithsonian\\". Asimov laments the skepticism with which chronochemistry has been greeted in America, noting with sorrow that his address has only attracted fifteen attendees. He then contrasts the thriving state of chronochemistry in the Soviet Union, with the research town of Khrushchevsk, nicknamed \\"Tiotimolingrad\\", established in the Urals. According to Asimov, two Scottish researchers have developed a \\"telechronic battery\\", which uses a series of 77,000 interconnected endochronometers to allow a final sample of thiotimoline to dissolve up to a day before water is added to an initial sample. Asimov says there is \\"strong, if indirect, evidence that the Soviet Union possesses even more sophisticated devices and is turning them out in commercial quantities\\". He believes that the Soviets are using telechronic batteries to determine ahead of time whether satellite launches will be successful. Finally, Asimov describes attempts to create a \\"Heisenberg failure\\", to get a sample of thiotimoline to dissolve without later adding water to it. In every case where the thiotimoline dissolved, some accident occurred that caused some water to be added to it at the proper time. Several attempts to create a Heisenberg failure in the mid-1950s coincided with a series of hurricanes striking New England in such a manner as to suggest that nature would find a way to add water whatever man decided, if man were to be resolute in not adding water. Asimov speculated that Noah's flood might have been brought about by thiotimoline experiments among the ancient Sumerians. He then concludes with some speculation about thiotimoline's potential applications as a weapon of mass destruction by deliberately using it to artificially induce hurricanes. \\"Thiotimoline and the Space Age\\" appeared in the October 1960 issue of Astounding, which was then in the final stages of changing its name to Analog. The article was reprinted in full in Opus 100 (1969) and The Asimov Chronicles: Fifty Years of Isaac Asimov (1989). \\"Thiotimoline to the Stars\\" Asimov's final piece on thiotimoline was a short story titled \\"Thiotimoline to the Stars\\", which he wrote for Harry Harrison's Astounding (1973). In it, Admiral Vernon, Commandant of the Astronautic Academy, gives a speech to the graduating \\"Class of '22\\". Vernon's speech explains that thiotimoline was first mentioned in 1948 by a semi- mythical scientist named Azimuth or Asymptote, but that serious study of the compound didn't begin until the 21st century scientist Almirante worked out the theory of hypersteric hindrance. Later scientists worked out ways to form endochronic molecules into polymers, allowing large structures such as spaceships to be built out of endochronic materials. One effect of endochronicity is that if one fails to add water to an object that has reacted to water, the object will travel into the future in search of water to interact with. An individual with sufficient inborn talent, Vernon explains, can perfectly balance a starship's endochronicity with relativistic time dilation, so that a ship traveling at relativistic speeds can age at the same rate as the rest of the universe, allowing it to return to its starting point within months, rather than centuries, of its departure. Vernon emphasizes that starship pilots are expected to match endochronicity with relativity exactly: a sixty-second difference between the two is regarded as barely acceptable, and a 120-second difference is considered grounds for dismissal. Vernon also emphasizes that endochronic molecules are unstable, and must be renewed before each trip, so that an endochronic ship that finds itself lost might not have sufficient endochronicity to return to its proper time. A ship that finds itself in the future might be able to re-endochronize itself if the technology still exists; a ship that finds itself in the past will be marooned there. Finally, Vernon reveals that the auditorium where he is giving his speech is actually an endochronic starship, and that during his speech, they have all flown to the outskirts of the Solar System. The graduates felt no acceleration because canceling out time dilation also caused the canceling out of inertia. When Vernon concludes his speech, the graduates will be landing in the United Nations Port at Lincoln, Nebraska, where they will be spending the weekend. After they land, Vernon receives an awful shock and passes out when his pilot informs him that the ship is surrounded by Indians. Vernon wrongly assumed the pilot meant Red Indians, and thought that they had landed centuries in the past. But the pilot only meant that they had landed at the correct time but near Calcutta, India. Asimov included \\"Thiotimoline to the Stars\\" in his 1975 collection Buy Jupiter and Other Stories. Other references to thiotimoline In Glen Bever's story \\"And Silently Vanish Away\\" a chemist with the unique ability to use psychokinetic catalysis to speed up difficult reactions is shocked by a lab explosion and the mixture he was working on gets changed. Under analysis the structure never appears to be the same twice and when the substance is injected into lab rats they start to silently and suddenly vanish. It is found that one part of the compound is a molecule which spreads out into four dimensions. The four-dimensional molecule is thiotimoline. The story appeared in the November 1971 issue of Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact. Topi H. Barr's story \\"Antithiotimoline\\" deals with a chemist who accidentally creates a thiotimoline-like compound which extrudes only into the past, enabling the scientist to create images of past events. The narrator complains that thiotimoline is extremely difficult to obtain, and suspects that the CIA or other agencies are controlling the supply for their own reasons. The story appeared in the December 1977 issue of Analog. Spider Robinson's story \\"Mirror mirror, off the wall\\", published in Time Travelers Strictly Cash in 1981, also references thiotimoline. In Robert Silverberg's 1989 story \\"The Asenion Solution\\", thiotimoline is used to send excess quantities of plutonium-186 to the end of time, where they will fall over the brink into anti-time and lead to the Big Bang. \\"The Asenion Solution\\" appeared in the Asimov festschrift Foundation's Friends. The November/December 2001 and March/April 2002 issues of the IEEE Design & Test of Computers included spoof articles on the use of thiotimoline for debugging computers.The Last ByteYet Another Thiotimoline Application In the game We Happy Few, a mysterious liquid called \\"motilene\\" acts as the primary source of electrical power in the setting, and is pumped throughout the city in pipes in lieu of a traditional electrical grid, or alternatively placed into special jars to act as portable batteries. A research note can be found in one location which makes reference to \\"thiomotilene crystals\\" and their \\"endochronic properties\\", which in turn strongly suggests motilene's name be derived from thiotimoline.

EEG of a mouse that shows REM sleep being characterized by prominent theta-rhythm Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep or REMS) is a unique phase of sleep in mammals and birds, characterized by random rapid movement of the eyes, accompanied by low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly. The REM phase is also known as paradoxical sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep because of physiological similarities to waking states, including rapid, low-voltage desynchronized brain waves. Electrical and chemical activity regulating this phase seems to originate in the brain stem and is characterized most notably by an abundance of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, combined with a nearly complete absence of monoamine neurotransmitters histamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. REM sleep is physiologically different from the other phases of sleep, which are collectively referred to as non-REM sleep (NREM sleep, NREMS, synchronized sleep). REM and non-REM sleep alternate within one sleep cycle, which lasts about 90 minutes in adult humans. As sleep cycles continue, they shift towards a higher proportion of REM sleep. The transition to REM sleep brings marked physical changes, beginning with electrical bursts called PGO waves originating in the brain stem. Organisms in REM sleep suspend central homeostasis, allowing large fluctuations in respiration, thermoregulation, and circulation which do not occur in any other modes of sleeping or waking. The body abruptly loses muscle tone, a state known as REM atonia. Professor Nathaniel Kleitman and his student Eugene Aserinsky defined rapid eye movement and linked it to dreams in 1953. REM sleep was further described by researchers including William Dement and Michel Jouvet. Many experiments have involved awakening test subjects whenever they begin to enter the REM phase, thereby producing a state known as REM deprivation. Subjects allowed to sleep normally again usually experience a modest REM rebound. Techniques of neurosurgery, chemical injection, electroencephalography, positron emission tomography, and reports of dreamers upon waking, have all been used to study this phase of sleep.  Physiology = Electrical activity in the brain= Polysomnographic record of REM Sleep. EEG highlighted by red box. Eye movement highlighted by red line. REM sleep is \\"paradoxical\\" because of its similarities to wakefulness. Although the body is paralyzed, the brain acts somewhat awake, with cerebral neurons firing with the same overall intensity as in wakefulness.Luca Matarazzo, Ariane Foret, Laura Mascetti, Vincenzo Muto, Anahita Shaffii, & Pierre Maquet, \\"A systems-level approach to human REM sleep\\"; in Mallick et al, eds. (2011). Electroencephalography during REM deep sleep reveal fast, low amplitude, desynchronized neural oscillation (brainwaves) that resemble the pattern seen during wakefulness which differ from the slow Œ¥ (delta) waves pattern of NREM deep sleep.Ritchie E. Brown & Robert W. McCarley (2008), \\"Neuroanatomical and neurochemical basis of wakefulness and REM sleep systems\\", in Neurochemistry of Sleep and Wakefulness ed. Monti et al.Steriade & McCarley (1990), \\"Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep\\", ¬ß1.2 (pp. 7‚Äì23). An important element of this contrast is the 3-10 Hz theta rhythm in the hippocampusSteriade & McCarley (1990), \\"Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep\\", ¬ß7.2‚Äì3 (pp. 206‚Äì208). and 40‚Äì60 Hz gamma waves in the cortex; very similar patterns of EEG activity to these rhythms are also observed during wakefulness.Jim Horne (2013), \\"Why REM sleep? Clues beyond the laboratory in a more challenging world\\", Biological Psychology 92. The cortical and thalamic neurons in the waking and REM sleeping brain are more depolarized (fire more readily) than in the NREM deep sleeping brain.Steriade & McCarley (1990), \\"Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep\\", ¬ß8.1 (pp. 232‚Äì243). Human theta wave activity predominates during REM sleep in both the hippocampus and the cortex. During REM sleep, electrical connectivity among different parts of the brain manifests differently than during wakefulness. Frontal and posterior areas are less coherent in most frequencies, a fact which has been cited in relation to the chaotic experience of dreaming. However, the posterior areas are more coherent with each other; as are the right and left hemispheres of the brain, especially during lucid dreams.Jayne Gackenbach, \\"Interhemispheric EEG Coherence in REM Sleep and Meditation: The Lucid Dreaming Connection\\" in Antrobus & Bertini (eds.), The Neuropsychology of Sleep and Dreaming.Edward F. Pace-Schott, \\"REM sleep and dreaming\\", in Mallick et al, eds. (2011). Brain energy use in REM sleep, as measured by oxygen and glucose metabolism, equals or exceeds energy use in waking. The rate in non-REM sleep is 11‚Äì40% lower.  Brain stem  Neural activity during REM sleep seems to originate in the brain stem, especially the pontine tegmentum and locus coeruleus. REM sleep is punctuated and immediately preceded by PGO (ponto-geniculo-occipital) waves, bursts of electrical activity originating in the brain stem.Steriade & McCarley (1990), \\"Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep\\", ¬ß9.1‚Äì2 (pp. 263‚Äì282). (PGO waves have long been measured directly in cats but not in humans because of constraints on experimentation; however, comparable effects have been observed in humans during \\"phasic\\" events which occur during REM sleep, and the existence of similar PGO waves is thus inferred.) These waves occur in clusters about every 6 seconds for 1‚Äì2 minutes during the transition from deep to paradoxical sleep. They exhibit their highest amplitude upon moving into the visual cortex and are a cause of the \\"rapid eye movements\\" in paradoxical sleep.Subimal Datta (1999), \\"PGO Wave Generation: Mechanism and functional significance\\", in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep ed. Mallick & Inou√©. Other muscles may also contract under the influence of these waves.  Forebrain  Research in the 1990s using positron emission tomography (PET) confirmed the role of the brain stem and suggested that, within the forebrain, the limbic and paralimbic systems showed more activation than other areas. The areas activated during REM sleep are approximately inverse to those activated during non-REM sleep and display greater activity than in quiet waking. The \\"anterior paralimbic REM activation area\\" (APRA) includes areas linked with emotion, memory, fear and sex, and may thus relate to the experience of dreaming during REMS. More recent PET research has indicated that the distribution of brain activity during REM sleep varies in correspondence with the type of activity seen in the prior period of wakefulness. The superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal areas, intraparietal sulcus, and superior parietal cortex, areas involved in sophisticated mental activity, show equal activity in REM sleep as in wakefulness. The amygdala is also active during REM sleep and may participate in generating the PGO waves, and experimental suppression of the amygdala results in less REM sleep.Larry D. Sanford & Richard J. Ross, \\"Amygdalar regulation of REM sleep\\"; in Mallick et al. (2011). The amygdala may also cardiac function in lieu of the less active insular cortex. = Chemicals in the brain = Compared to slow-wave sleep, both waking and paradoxical sleep involve higher use of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which may cause the faster brainwaves. The monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin and histamine are completely unavailable. Injections of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which effectively increases available acetylcholine, have been found to induce paradoxical sleep in humans and other animals already in slow- wave sleep. Carbachol, which mimics the effect of acetylcholine on neurons, has a similar influence. In waking humans, the same injections produce paradoxical sleep only if the monoamine neurotransmitters have already been depleted.Birendra N. Mallick, Vibha Madan, & Sushil K.

Two other neurotransmitters, orexin and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), seem to promote wakefulness, diminish during deep sleep, and inhibit paradoxical sleep.Pierre-Herv√© Luppi et al. (2008), \\"Gamma-aminobutyric acid and the regulation of paradoxical, or rapid eye movement, sleep\\", in Neurochemistry of Sleep and Wakefulness ed. Monti et al. Unlike the abrupt transitions in electrical patterns, the chemical changes in the brain show continuous periodic oscillation.Robert W. McCarley (2007), \\"Neurobiology of REM and NREM sleep\\", Sleep Medicine 8.  Models of REM regulation  According to the activation-synthesis hypothesis proposed by Robert McCarley and Allan Hobson in 1975‚Äì1977, control over REM sleep involves pathways of \\"REM-on\\" and \\"REM-off\\" neurons in the brain stem. REM-on neurons are primarily cholinergic (i.e., involve acetylcholine); REM-off neurons activate serotonin and noradrenaline, which among other functions suppress the REM-on neurons. McCarley and Hobson suggested that the REM-on neurons actually stimulate REM-off neurons, thereby serving as the mechanism for the cycling between REM and non-REM sleep.J. Alan Hobson & Robert W. McCarley, \\"The Brain as a Dream-State Generator: An Activation-Synthesis Hypothesis of the Dream Process\\", American Journal of Psychiatry 134.12, December 1977. They used Lotka‚ÄìVolterra equations to describe this cyclical inverse relationship.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß12.2 (pp. 369‚Äì373). Kayuza Sakai and Michel Jouvet advanced a similar model in 1981. Whereas acetylcholine manifests in the cortex equally during wakefulness and REM, it appears in higher concentrations in the brain stem during REM.Ralph Lydic & Helen A. Baghdoyan, \\"Acetylcholine modulates sleep and wakefulness: a synaptic perspective\\", in Neurochemistry of Sleep and Wakefulness ed. Monti et al. The withdrawal of orexin and GABA may cause the absence of the other excitatory neurotransmitters;Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 16. researchers in recent years increasingly include GABA regulation in their models.James T. McKenna, Lichao Chen, & Robert McCarley, \\"Neuronal models of REM-sleep control: evolving concepts\\"; in Mallick et al. (2011). = Eye movements = Most of the eye movements in \\"rapid eye movement\\" sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration and more likely to loop back to their starting point. About seven of such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß10.7.2 (pp. 307‚Äì309). These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for procedural memory processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the brain processing the eye-related procedural memory. = Circulation, respiration, and thermoregulation = Generally speaking, the body suspends homeostasis during paradoxical sleep. Heart rate, cardiac pressure, cardiac output, arterial pressure, and breathing rate quickly become irregular when the body moves into REM sleep.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 12‚Äì15. In general, respiratory reflexes such as response to hypoxia diminish. Overall, the brain exerts less control over breathing; electrical stimulation of respiration-linked brain areas does not influence the lungs, as it does during non-REM sleep and in waking.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 22‚Äì27. The fluctuations of heart rate and arterial pressure tend to coincide with PGO waves and rapid eye movements, twitches, or sudden changes in breathing.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 35‚Äì37 Erections of the penis (nocturnal penile tumescence or NPT) normally accompany REM sleep in rats and humans.Jouvet (1999), The Paradox of Sleep, pp. 169‚Äì173. If a male has erectile dysfunction (ED) while awake, but has NPT episodes during REM, it would suggest that the ED is from a psychological rather than a physiological cause. In females, erection of the clitoris (nocturnal clitoral tumescence or NCT) causes enlargement, with accompanying vaginal blood flow and transudation (i.e. lubrication). During a normal night of sleep the penis and clitoris may be erect for a total time of from one hour to as long as three and a half hours during REM.Brown et al. (2012), \\"Control of Sleep and Wakefulness\\", p. 1127. Body temperature is not well regulated during REM sleep, and thus organisms become more sensitive to temperatures outside their thermoneutral zone. Cats and other small furry mammals will shiver and breathe faster to regulate temperature during NREMS but not during REMS.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 12‚Äì13. With the loss of muscle tone, animals lose the ability to regulate temperature through body movement. (However, even cats with pontine lesions preventing muscle atonia during REM did not regulate their temperature by shivering.)Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, pp. 46‚Äì47. Neurons which typically activate in response to cold temperatures‚Äîtriggers for neural thermoregulation‚Äîsimply do not fire during REM sleep, as they do in NREM sleep and waking.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, pp. 51‚Äì52. Consequently, hot or cold environmental temperatures can reduce the proportion of REM sleep, as well as amount of total sleep.Ronald Szymusiak, Md. Noor Alam, & Dennis McGinty (1999), \\"Thermoregulatory Control of the NonREM-REM Sleep Cycle\\", in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep ed. Mallick & Inou√©.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, pp. 57‚Äì59. In other words, if at the end of a phase of deep sleep, the organism's thermal indicators fall outside of a certain range, it will not enter paradoxical sleep lest deregulation allow temperature to drift further from the desirable value.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 45. \\"Therefore, it appears that the onset of REM sleep requires the inactivation of the central thermostat in late NREM sleep. However, only a restricted range of preoptic- hypothalamic temperatures at the end of NREM sleep is compatible with REM sleep onset. This range may be considered a sort of temperature gate for REM sleep, that is constrained in width more at low than at neutral ambient temperature.\\" This mechanism can be 'fooled' by artificially warming the brain.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 61. \\"On the other hand, a balance between opposing ambient and preoptic- anterior hypothalamic thermal loads influencing peripheral and central thermoreceptors, respectively, may be experimentally achieved so as to promote sleep. In particular, warming of the preoptic-anterior hypothalamic region in a cold environment hastens REM sleep onset and increases its duration (Parmeggiana et al., 1974, 1980; Sakaguchi et al., 1979).\\" = Muscle = REM atonia, an almost complete paralysis of the body, is accomplished through the inhibition of motor neurons. When the body shifts into REM sleep, motor neurons throughout the body undergo a process called hyperpolarization: their already-negative membrane potential decreases by another 2‚Äì10 millivolts, thereby raising the threshold which a stimulus must overcome to excite them. Muscle inhibition may result from unavailability of monoamine neurotransmitters (restraining the abundance of acetylcholine in the brainstem) and perhaps from mechanisms used in waking muscle inhibition.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß10.8‚Äì9 (pp. 309‚Äì324). The medulla oblongata, located between pons and spine, seems to have the capacity for organism-wide muscle inhibition.Yuan- Yang Lai & Jerome M. Siegel (1999), \\"Muscle Atonia in REM Sleep\\", in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep ed. Mallick & Inou√©. Some localized twitching and reflexes can still occur.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 17. \\"In other words, the functional controls requiring high hierarchical levels of integration are the most affected during REM sleep, whereas reflex activity is only altered but not obliterated.\\" Pupils contract. Lack of REM atonia causes REM behavior disorder, sufferers of which physically act out their dreams, or conversely \\"dream out their acts\\", under an alternative theory on the relationship between muscle impulses during REM and associated mental imagery (which would also apply to people without the condition, except that commands to their muscles are suppressed).Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß13.3.2.3 (pp. 428‚Äì432). This is different from conventional sleepwalking, which takes place during slow-wave sleep, not REM.Jouvet (1999), The Paradox of Sleep, p. 102. Narcolepsy by contrast seems to involve excessive and unwanted REM atonia‚Äîi.e., cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness while awake, hypnagogic hallucinations before entering slow-wave sleep, or sleep paralysis while waking.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß13.1 (pp. 396‚Äì400). Other psychiatric disorders including depression have been linked to disproportionate REM sleep.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß13.2 (pp. 400‚Äì415). Patients with suspected sleep disorders are typically evaluated by polysomnogram. Lesions of the pons to prevent atonia have induced functional \\"REM behavior disorder\\" in animals.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 87. \\"The open-loop mode of physiological regulation in REM sleep may restore the efficiency of the different neuronal networks of the brain stem by expressing also genetically coded patterns of instinctive behavior that are kept normally hidden from view by skeletal muscle atonia. Such behaviorally concealed neuronal activity was demonstrated by the effects of experimental lesions of specific pontine structures (Hendricks, 1982; Hendricks et al., 1977, 1982; Henley and Morrison, 1974; Jouvet and Delorme, 1965; Sastre and Jouvet, 1979; Villablanca, 1996). Not only was the skeletal muscle atonia suppressed by also motor fragments of complex instinctive behaviors appeared, such as walking and attack, that were not externally motivated (see Morrison, 2005).\\"  Psychology = Dreaming = Rapid eye movement sleep (REM) has since its discovery been closely associated with dreaming. Waking up sleepers during a REM phase is a common experimental method for obtaining dream reports; 80% of neurotypical people can give some kind of dream report under these circumstances.Solms (1997), The Neuropsychology of Dreams, pp. 10, 34.Edward F. Pace-Schott, \\"REM sleep and dreaming\\", in Mallick et al, eds. (2011), p. 8. \\"A meta-analysis of 29 awakening studies by Nielsen (2000) revealed that about 82% of awakenings from REM result in recall of a dream whereas this frequency following NREM awakenings is lower at 42%.\\" Sleepers awakened from REM tend to give longer, more narrative descriptions of the dreams they were experiencing, and to estimate the duration of their dreams as longer.J. Alan Hobson, Edward F. Pace-Scott, & Robert Stickgold (2000), \\"Dreaming and the brain: Toward a cognitive neuroscience of conscious states\\", Behavioral and Brain Sciences 23. Lucid dreams are reported far more often in REM sleep.Stephen LaBerge (1992), \\"Physiological Studies of Lucid Dreaming\\", in Antrobus & Bertini (eds.), The Neuropsychology of Sleep and Dreaming. (In fact these could be considered a hybrid state combining essential elements of REM sleep and waking consciousness.) The mental events which occur during REM most commonly have dream hallmarks including narrative structure, convincingness (experiential resemblance to waking life), and incorporation of instinctual themes. Sometimes they include elements of the dreamer's recent experience taken directly from episodic memory. By one estimate, 80% of dreams occur during REM. Hobson and McCarley proposed that the PGO waves characteristic of \\"phasic\\" REM might supply the visual cortex and forebrain with electrical excitement which amplifies the hallucinatory aspects of dreaming. However, people woken up during sleep do not report significantly more bizarre dreams during phasic REMS, compared to tonic REMS. Another possible relationship between the two phenomena could be that the higher threshold for sensory interruption during REM sleep allows the brain to travel further along unrealistic and peculiar trains of thought. Some dreaming can take place during non-REM sleep. \\"Light sleepers\\" can experience dreaming during stage 2 non-REM sleep, whereas \\"deep sleepers\\", upon awakening in the same stage, are more likely to report \\"thinking\\" but not \\"dreaming\\". Certain scientific efforts to assess the uniquely bizarre nature of dreams experienced while asleep were forced to conclude that waking thought could be just as bizarre, especially in conditions of sensory deprivation.Ruth Reinsel, John Antrobus, & Miriam Wollman (1992), \\"Bizarreness in Dreams and Waking Fantasy\\", in Antrobus & Bertini (eds.), The Neuropsychology of Sleep and Dreaming.Delphine Ouidette et al. (2012), \\"Dreaming without REM sleep\\", Consciousness and Cognition 21. Because of non-REM dreaming, some sleep researchers have strenuously contested the importance of connecting dreaming to the REM sleep phase. The prospect that well-known neurological aspects of REM do not themselves cause dreaming suggests the need to re-examine the neurobiology of dreaming per se.Solms (1997), The Neuropsychology of Dreams, Chapter 6: \\"The Problem of REM Sleep\\" (pp. 54‚Äì57).\\" Some researchers (Dement, Hobson, Jouvet, for example) tend to resist the idea of disconnecting dreaming from REM sleep.Jouvet (1999), The Paradox of Sleep, p. 104. \\"I frankly support the theory that we do not dream all night, as do William Dement and Alan Hobson and most neurophysiologists. I am rather surprised that publications about dream recall during slow wave sleep increase in number each year. Further, the classic distinction established in the 1960s between 'poor' dream recall, devoid of color and detail, during slow wave sleep, and 'rich' recall, full of color and detail, during paradoxical sleep, is beginning to disappear. I believe that dream recall during slow wave sleep could be recall from previous paradoxical sleep.\\"  Effects of SSRIs  Previous research has shown that SSRIs have an important effect on REM sleep neurobiology and dreaming, and serve to intensify dreaming in humans. A study at Harvard Medical School in 2000 tested the effects of paroxetine and fluvoxamine on healthy young adult male and females for 31 days: a drug-free baseline week, 19 days on either paroxetine or fluvoxamine with morning and evening doses, and 5 days of absolute discontinuation. Results showed that SSRI treatment decreased the average amount of dream recall frequency in comparison to baseline measurements as a result of serotonergic REM suppression. Fluvoxamine increased the length of dream reporting, bizarreness of dreams as well as the intensity of REM sleep. These effects were the greatest during acute discontinuation compared to treatment and baseline days. However, the subjective intensity of dreaming increased and the proclivity to enter REM sleep was decreased during SSRI treatment compared to baseline and discontinuation days. = Creativity = After waking from REM sleep, the mind seems \\"hyperassociative\\"‚Äîmore receptive to semantic priming effects. People awakened from REM have performed better on tasks like anagrams and creative problem solving.Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 688. Sleep aids the process by which creativity forms associative elements into new combinations that are useful or meet some requirement. This occurs in REM sleep rather than in NREM sleep. Rather than being due to memory processes, this has been attributed to changes during REM sleep in cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulation. High levels of acetylcholine in the hippocampus suppress feedback from hippocampus to the neocortex, while lower levels of acetylcholine and norepinephrine in the neocortex encourage the uncontrolled spread of associational activity within neocortical areas. This is in contrast to waking consciousness, where higher levels of norepinephrine and acetylcholine inhibit recurrent connections in the neocortex. REM sleep through this process adds creativity by allowing \\"neocortical structures to reorganise associative hierarchies, in which information from the hippocampus would be reinterpreted in relation to previous semantic representations or nodes.\\"  Timing  Sample hypnogram (electroencephalogram of sleep) showing sleep cycles characterized by increasing paradoxical (REM) sleep. In the ultradian sleep cycle an organism alternates between deep sleep (slow, large, synchronized brain waves) and paradoxical sleep (faster, desynchronized waves). Sleep happens in the context of the larger circadian rhythm, which influences sleepiness and physiological factors based on timekeepers within the body. Sleep can be distributed throughout the day or clustered during one part of the rhythm: in nocturnal animals, during the day, and in diurnal animals, at night.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 9‚Äì11. The organism returns to homeostatic regulation almost immediately after REM sleep ends.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 17. During a night of sleep, humans usually experience about four or five periods of REM sleep; they are shorter (~15 min) at the beginning of the night and longer (~25 min) toward the end. Many animals and some people tend to wake, or experience a period of very light sleep, for a short time immediately after a bout of REM. The relative amount of REM sleep varies considerably with age. A newborn baby spends more than 80% of total sleep time in REM. REM sleep typically occupies 20‚Äì25% of total sleep in adult humans: about 90‚Äì120 minutes of a night's sleep. The first REM episode occurs about 70 minutes after falling asleep. Cycles of about 90 minutes each follow, with each cycle including a larger proportion of REM sleep. (The increased REM sleep later in the night is connected with the circadian rhythm and occurs even in people who didn't sleep in the first part of the night.)Daniel Aeschbach, \\"REM-sleep regulation: circadian, homeostatic, and non-REM sleep-dependent determinants\\"; in Mallick et al. (2011). In the weeks after a human baby is born, as its nervous system matures, neural patterns in sleep begin to show a rhythm of REM and non-REM sleep. (In faster- developing mammals this process occurs in utero.)Marcos G. Frank, \\"The ontogeny and function(s) of REM sleep\\", in Mallick et al, eds. (2011). Infants spend more time in REM sleep than adults. The proportion of REM sleep then decreases significantly in childhood. Older people tend to sleep less overall but sleep in REM for about the same absolute time, and therefore spend a greater proportion of sleep in REM.Kazuo Mishima, Tetsuo Shimizu, & Yasuo Hishikawa (1999), \\"REM Sleep Across Age and Sex\\", in Rapid Eye Movement Sleep ed. Mallick & Inou√©. Rapid eye movement sleep can be subclassified into tonic and phasic modes. Tonic REM is characterized by theta rhythms in the brain; phasic REM is characterized by PGO waves and actual \\"rapid\\" eye movements. Processing of external stimuli is heavily inhibited during phasic REM, and recent evidence suggests that sleepers are more difficult to arouse from phasic REM than in slow-wave sleep.Ummehan Ermis, Karsten Krakow, & Ursula Voss (2010), \\"Arousal thresholds during human tonic and phasic REM sleep\\", Journal of Sleep Research 19.  Deprivation effects  Selective REMS deprivation causes a significant increase in the number of attempts to go into REM stage while asleep. On recovery nights, an individual will usually move to stage 3 and REM sleep more quickly and experience a REM rebound, which refers to an increase in the time spent in REM stage over normal levels. These findings are consistent with the idea that REM sleep is biologically necessary.Steven J. Ellman, Arthur J. Spielman, Dana Luck, Solomon S. Steiner, & Ronnie Halperin (1991), \\"REM Deprivation: A Review\\", in The Mind in Sleep, ed. Ellman & Antrobus. However, the \\"rebound\\" REM sleep usually does not last fully as long as the estimated length of the missed REM periods. After the deprivation is complete, mild psychological disturbances, such as anxiety, irritability, hallucinations, and difficulty concentrating may develop and appetite may increase. There are also positive consequences of REM deprivation. Some symptoms of depression are found to be suppressed by REM deprivation; aggression may increase, and eating behavior may get disrupted. Higher norepinepherine is a possible cause of these results. Whether and how long-term REM deprivation has psychological effects remains a matter of controversy. Several reports have indicated that REM deprivation increases aggression and sexual behavior in laboratory test animals. Rats deprived of paradoxical sleep die in 4‚Äì6 weeks (twice the time before death in case of total sleep deprivation). Mean body temperature falls continually during this period.Nishidh Barot & Clete Kushida, \\"Significance of deprivation studies\\"; in Mallick et al. (2011). It has been suggested that acute REM sleep deprivation can improve certain types of depression when depression appears to be related to an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters. Although sleep deprivation in general annoys most of the population, it has repeatedly been shown to alleviate depression, albeit temporarily. More than half the individuals who experience this relief report it to be rendered ineffective after sleeping the following night. Thus, researchers have devised methods such as altering the sleep schedule for a span of days following a REM deprivation period and combining sleep-schedule alterations with pharmacotherapy to prolong this effect. Antidepressants (including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and stimulants (such as amphetamine, methylphenidate and cocaine) interfere with REM sleep by stimulating the monoamine neurotransmitters which must be suppressed for REM sleep to occur. Administered at therapeutic doses, these drugs may stop REM sleep entirely for weeks or months. Withdrawal causes a REM rebound. Sleep deprivation stimulates hippocampal neurogenesis much as antidepressants do, but whether this effect is driven by REM sleep in particular is unknown. In other animals Ostriches sleeping, with REM and slow-wave sleep phases. Rapid eye movement of a dog Although it manifests differently in different animals, REM sleep or something like it occurs in all land mammals as well as in birds. The primary criteria used to identify REM are the change in electrical activity, measured by EEG, and loss of muscle tone, interspersed with bouts of twitching in phasic REM.Niels C. Rattenborg, John A. Lesku, and Dolores Martinez-Gonzalez, \\"Evolutionary perspectives on the function of REM sleep\\", in Mallick et al, eds. (2011). The amount of REM sleep and cycling varies among animals; predators experience more REM sleep than prey. Larger animals also tend to stay in REM for longer, possibly because higher thermal inertia of their brains and bodies allows them to tolerate longer suspension of thermoregulation.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, pp. 13, 59‚Äì61. \\"In species with different body mass (e.g., rats, rabbits, cats, humans) the average duration of REM sleep episodes increases with the increase in body and brain weight, a determinant of the thermal inertia. Such inertia delays the changes in body core temperature so alarming as to elicit arousal from REM sleep. In addition, other factors, such as fur, food, and predator‚Äìprey relationships influencing REM sleep duration out to be mentioned here.\\" The period (full cycle of REM and non-REM) lasts for about 90 minutes in humans, 22 minutes in cats, and 12 minutes in rats.Steriade & McCarley (1990), Brainstem Control of Wakefulness and Sleep, ¬ß12.1 (p. 363). In utero, mammals spend more than half (50‚Äì80%) of a 24-hour day in REM sleep. Sleeping reptiles do not seem to have PGO waves or the localized brain activation seen in mammalian REM. However they do exhibit sleep cycles with phases of REM-like electrical activity measurable by EEG. A recent study found periodic eye movements in the central bearded dragon of Australia, leading its authors to speculate that the common ancestor of amniotes may therefore have manifested some precursor to REMS. Sleep deprivation experiments on non-human animals can be set up differently than those on humans. The \\"flower pot\\" method involves placing a laboratory animal above water on a platform so small that it falls off upon losing muscle tone. The naturally rude awakening which results may elicit changes in the organism which necessarily exceed the simple absence of a sleep phase.Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 686‚Äì687. This method also stops working after about 3 days as the subjects (typically rats) lose their will to avoid the water. Another method involves computer monitoring of brain waves, complete with automatic mechanized shaking of the cage when the test animal drifts into REM sleep. Possible functions Some researchers argue that the perpetuation of a complex brain process such as REM sleep indicates that it serves an important function for the survival of mammalian and avian species. It fulfills important physiological needs vital for survival to the extent that prolonged REM sleep deprivation leads to death in experimental animals. In both humans and experimental animals, REM sleep loss leads to several behavioral and physiological abnormalities. Loss of REM sleep has been noticed during various natural and experimental infections. Survivability of the experimental animals decreases when REM sleep is totally attenuated during infection; this leads to the possibility that the quality and quantity of REM sleep is generally essential for normal body physiology.Robert P. Vertes (1986), \\"A Life-Sustaining Function for REM Sleep: A Theory\\", Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews 10. Further, the existence of a \\"REM rebound\\" effect suggests the possibility of a biological need for REM sleep. While the precise function of REM sleep is not well understood, several theories have been proposed. =Memory= Sleep in general aids memory. REM sleep may favor the preservation of certain types of memories: specifically, procedural memory, spatial memory, and emotional memory. In rats, REM sleep increases following intensive learning, especially several hours after, and sometimes for multiple nights. Experimental REM sleep deprivation has sometimes inhibited memory consolidation, especially regarding complex processes (e.g., how to escape from an elaborate maze).Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 686. Deprivation of REM sleep (mostly without simultaneous sleep recording) appeared to primarily impair memory for- mation on complex tasks, like two-way shuttle box avoidance and complex mazes, which encompass a change in the animals regular repertoire (69, 100, 312, 516, 525, 539, 644, 710, 713, 714, 787, 900, 903‚Äì906, 992, 1021, 1072, 1111, 1113, 1238, 1352, 1353). In contrast, long-term memory for simpler tasks, like one-way active avoidance and simple mazes, were less consistently affected (15, 249, 386, 390, 495, 558, 611, 644, 821, 872, 902, 907‚Äì909, 1072, 1091, 1334).\\" In humans, the best evidence for REM's improvement of memory pertains to learning of procedures‚Äînew ways of moving the body (such as trampoline jumping), and new techniques of problem solving. REM deprivation seemed to impair declarative (i.e., factual) memory only in more complex cases, such as memories of longer stories.Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 687. REM sleep apparently counteracts attempts to suppress certain thoughts. According to the dual-process hypothesis of sleep and memory, the two major phases of sleep correspond to different types of memory. \\"Night half\\" studies have tested this hypothesis with memory tasks either begun before sleep and assessed in the middle of the night, or begun in the middle of the night and assessed in the morning.Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 689. \\"The dual process hypothesis assumes that different sleep stages serve the consolidation of different types of memories (428, 765, 967, 1096). Specifically it has been assumed that declarative memory profits from SWS, whereas the consolidation of nondeclarative memory is supported by REM sleep.\\" This hypothesis received support mainly from studies in humans, particularly from those employing the 'night half paradigm.'\\" Slow-wave sleep, part of non-REM sleep, appears to be important for declarative memory. Artificial enhancement of the non-REM sleep improves the next-day recall of memorized pairs of words. Tucker et al. demonstrated that a daytime nap containing solely non-REM sleep enhances declarative memory but not procedural memory. According to the sequential hypothesis the two types of sleep work together to consolidate memory.Rasch & Born (2013), \\"About Sleep's Role in Memory\\", p. 690‚Äì691. Sleep researcher Jerome Siegel has observed that extreme REM deprivation does not significantly interfere with memory. One case study of an individual who had little or no REM sleep due to a shrapnel injury to the brainstem did not find the individual's memory to be impaired. Antidepressants, which suppress REM sleep, show no evidence of impairing memory and may improve it.Jerome M. Siegel (2001). \\"The REM Sleep-Memory Consolidation Hypothesis \\". Science Vol. 294. Graeme Mitchison and Francis Crick proposed in 1983 that by virtue of its inherent spontaneous activity, the function of REM sleep \\"is to remove certain undesirable modes of interaction in networks of cells in the cerebral cortex\\", which process they characterize as \\"unlearning\\". As a result, those memories which are relevant (whose underlying neuronal substrate is strong enough to withstand such spontaneous, chaotic activation) are further strengthened, whilst weaker, transient, \\"noise\\" memory traces disintegrate. Memory consolidation during paradoxical sleep is specifically correlated with the periods of rapid eye movement, which do not occur continuously. One explanation for this correlation is that the PGO electrical waves, which precede the eye movements, also influence memory. REM sleep could provide a unique opportunity for \\"unlearning\\" to occur in the basic neural networks involved in homeostasis, which are protected from this \\"synaptic downscaling\\" effect during deep sleep.Parmeggiani (2011), Systemic Homeostasis and Poikilostasis in Sleep, p. 89. \\"In contrast to NREM sleep, downscaling of synapses would be produced in REM sleep by random bursts of neuronal firing (e.g., also bursts underlying ponto-geniculo-occipital waves) (see Tonioni and Cirelli, 2005). / This hypothesis is particularly enriched in functional significance by considering at this point the opposite nature, homeostatic and poikilostatic, of the systemic neural regulation of physiological functions in these sleep states. The important fact is that homeostasis if fully preserved in NREM sleep. This means that a systemic synaptic downcaling (slow-wave electroencephalographic activity) is practically limited to the relatively homogenous cortical structures of the telencephalon, while the whole brain stem, from diencephalon to medulla, is still exerting its basic functions of integrated homeostatic regulation of both somatic and autonomic physiological functions. In REM sleep, however, the necessary synaptic downscaling in the brain stem is instead the result of random neuronal firing.\\" = Neural ontogeny = REM sleep prevails most after birth, and diminishes with age. According to the \\"ontogenetic hypothesis\\", REM (also known in neonates as active sleep) aids the developing brain by providing the neural stimulation that newborns need to form mature neural connections.Marks et al. 1994 Sleep deprivation studies have shown that deprivation early in life can result in behavioral problems, permanent sleep disruption, and decreased brain mass. The strongest evidence for the ontogenetic hypothesis comes from experiments on REM deprivation and the development of the visual system in the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex. = Defensive immobilization = Ioannis Tsoukalas of Stockholm University has hypothesized that REM sleep is an evolutionary transformation of a well-known defensive mechanism, the tonic immobility reflex. This reflex, also known as animal hypnosis or death feigning, functions as the last line of defense against an attacking predator and consists of the total immobilization of the animal so that it appears dead. Tsoukalas argues that the neurophysiology and phenomenology of this reaction shows striking similarities to REM sleep; for example, both reactions exhibit brainstem control, paralysis, hypocampal theta rhythm, and thermoregulatory changes.Vitelli, R. (2013). \\"Exploring the Mystery of REM Sleep\\". Psychology Today, On-line, March 25 =Shift of gaze= According to \\"scanning hypothesis\\", the directional properties of REM sleep are related to a shift of gaze in dream imagery. Against this hypothesis is that such eye movements occur in those born blind and in fetuses in spite of lack of vision. Also, binocular REMs are non-conjugated (i.e., the two eyes do not point in the same direction at a time) and so lack a fixation point. In support of this theory, research finds that in goal-oriented dreams, eye gaze is directed towards the dream action, determined from correlations in the eye and body movements of REM sleep behavior disorder patients who enact their dreams. =Oxygen supply to cornea= Dr. David M. Maurice (1922-2002), an eye specialist and semi-retired adjunct professor at Columbia University, proposed that REM sleep was associated with oxygen supply to the cornea, and that aqueous humor, the liquid between cornea and iris, was stagnant if not stirred. Among the supportive evidences, he calculated that if aqueous humor was stagnant, oxygen from iris had to reach cornea by diffusion through aqueous humor, which was not sufficient. According to the theory, when the animal is awake, eye movement (or cool environmental temperature) enables the aqueous humor to circulate. When the animal is sleeping, REM provides the much-needed stir to aqueous humor. This theory is consistent with the observation that fetuses, as well as eye-sealed newborn animals, spend much time in REM sleep, and that during a normal sleep, a person's REM sleep episodes become progressively longer deeper into the night. However, owls have REM sleep, but do not move their head more than in non-REM sleep; see Fig. S1 and is well known that owls' eyes are nearly immobile. =Other theories= Another theory suggests that monoamine shutdown is required so that the monoamine receptors in the brain can recover to regain full sensitivity. The sentinel hypothesis of REM sleep was put forward by Frederick Snyder in 1966. It is based upon the observation that REM sleep in several mammals (the rat, the hedgehog, the rabbit, and the rhesus monkey) is followed by a brief awakening. This does not occur for either cats or humans, although humans are more likely to wake from REM sleep than from NREM sleep. Snyder hypothesized that REM sleep activates an animal periodically, to scan the environment for possible predators. This hypothesis does not explain the muscle paralysis of REM sleep; however, a logical analysis might suggest that the muscle paralysis exists to prevent the animal from fully waking up unnecessarily, and allowing it to return easily to deeper sleep.Jouvet (1999), The Paradox of Sleep, pp. 122‚Äì124. Jim Horne, a sleep researcher at Loughborough University, has suggested that REM in modern humans compensates for the reduced need for wakeful food foraging. Other theories are that REM sleep warms the brain, stimulates and stabilizes the neural circuits that have not been activated during waking, or creates internal stimulation to aid development of the CNS; while some argue that REM lacks any purpose, and simply results from random brain activation. Discovery and further research Recognition of different types of sleep can be seen in the literature of ancient India and Rome. Observers have long noticed that sleeping dogs twitch and move but only at certain times. The German scientist Richard Klaue in 1937 first discovered a period of fast electrical activity in the brains of sleeping cats. In 1944, Ohlmeyer reported 90-minute ultradian sleep cycles involving male erections lasting for 25 minutes.Jouvet (1999), The Paradox of Sleep, p. 32. At University of Chicago in 1952, Eugene Aserinsky, Nathaniel Kleitman, and William C. Dement, discovered phases of rapid eye movement during sleep, and connected these to dreaming. Their article was published September 10, 1953. Aserinsky, then Kleitman, first observed the eye movements and accompanying neuroelectrical activity in their own children.Adrian R. Morrison, \\"The Discovery of REM sleep: the death knell of the passive theory of sleep\\", in Mallick et al, eds. (2011). William Dement advanced the study of REM deprivation, with experiments in which subjects were awoken every time their EEG indicated the beginning of REM sleep. He published \\"The Effect of Dream Deprivation\\" in June 1960.William Dement, \\"The Effect of Dream Deprivation: The need for a certain amount of dreaming each night is suggested by recent experiments.\\" Science 131.3415, 10 June 1960. (\\"REM deprivation\\" has become the more common term following subsequent research indicating the possibility of non-REM dreaming.) Neurosurgical experiments by Michel Jouvet and others in the following two decades added an understanding of atonia and suggested the importance of the pontine tegmentum (dorsolateral pons) in enabling and regulating paradoxical sleep. Jouvet and others found that damaging the reticular formation of the brainstem inhibited this type of sleep. Jouvet coined the name \\"paradoxical sleep\\" in 1959 and in 1962 published results indicating that it could occur in a cat with its entire forebrain removed.Perrine M. Ruby (2011), \\"Experimental research on dreaming: state of the art and neuropsychoanalytic perspectives\\", Frontiers in Psychology 2. The mechanisms of muscle atonia was initially proposed by Horace Winchell Magoun in 1940s and later confirmed by Rodolfo Llin√°s in 1960s. Hiroki R. Ueda and his colleagues identified muscarinic receptor genes M1 (Chrm1) and M3 (Chrm3) as essential genes for REMS sleep.

It is the second largest city in the state and the largest city in North Karnataka along with its twin city Dharwad, in terms of area. It also houses the largest number of government offices outside Bangalore.http://www.autocarpro.in/news-national/safexpress-expands-logistics- network-locations-hubli-park-29159 In 2016, Hubli-Dharwad was selected for solar city / green city master plans. In 2017, government of India included Hubballi-Dharwad city for a smart city project, a flagship scheme for overall development of infrastructure in the twin-cities. Etymology The name Hubballi comes from the term Hoovina Balli which means 'Flowering Creeper' in Kannada. Hubli is the anglicised version of Hubballi. History Rayara Hubli, also called 'Eleya Purvada Halli' or 'Purballi', was the old Hubli, where there is a Bhavani Shankara temple and Jain basati. Under Vijayanagara Rayas, Rayara Hubli grew as a commercial centre, famous for trade in cotton, saltpetre and iron. Under the rule of the Adilshahis, the British opened a factory here. The factory was looted by Shivaji in 1673. The Mughals conquered Rayara Hubli and it was then placed under the governance of the Nawab of Savanur, who built a new extension named Majidpura. Later, trader Basappa Shettar built new Hubli around the Durgadabail (fort maidan) part of Rayara Hubli. Hubli's famous Moorusavira Matha is claimed to have been established by a Sharana of Basaveshwara's period. Hubli was conquered by the Marathas from the Nawab of Savanur in 1755-56. In the following years, Hubli was conquered by Hyder Ali, only to be recaptured by the Marathas in 1790. At this point in time, the old town was administered by a person named Phadke under the Peshwas and the new town was under the administration of the Sangli Patwardhan. The British took Old Hubli from the Peshwas in 1817. The new town, with 47 other villages, was handed over to the British by the Sangli Patwardhan in lieu of subsidy in 1820. Later in 1880, the British started the Railway workshop and with this, Hubli came to be reckoned as an industrial centre in this part of India. The impressive Chandramauleshwara temple in Unkal is from Chalukyan times. The Sufi shrine, Sayed Fathesha Wali, was visited by Tipu Sultan.https://www.deccanherald.com/content/478299/dargahs-hubballi.html  Geography = Climate = Hubli-Dharwad has a tropical wet and dry climate. Summers are hot and dry, lasting from late February to early June. They are followed by the monsoon season, with moderate temperatures and a large amount of precipitation. Temperatures are fairly moderate from late October to early February, with virtually no rainfall. Hubli is 640 meters above sea level. The average yearly rainfall is 838 mm. Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation Hubli-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) was constituted in 1962 by combining the two cities separated by a distance of 20 kilometres. The area covered by the corporation is spread over 45 revenue villages and is the second-largest city corporation in Karnataka after Bengalooru. The population of the city as per the 1991 census was 700,000. The population of Hubli- Dharwad is 943,857 according to 2011 Census. Hubli Municipal Council was established under the Government of India Act of 1850, and the Dharwad Municipal Council first came into existence on 1 January 1856. Both were merged later. The headquarters of HDMC is situated in Hubli, comprising 67 members covering four Vidhan Sabha Constituencies of Hubli-Dharwad.There has been a huge demand by people of Dharwad to create a separate civic body and get itself detached by HDMC.Claims are that most of the funds are allocated to Hubli solely. Economy Hubli is one of the commercial hubs of Karnataka. It is the fourth largest city of Karnataka in terms of economy after Bangalore, Mangalore & Mysore. It has a wide cluster of industries and has more than a lakh small and medium industries. The Government of India has set up a Software Technology Park of India on Pune‚ÄìBangalore Road and Aryabhata Tech Park in Navanagar region of Hubli. The city is situated on the dividing line between Malnad and the Deccan plateau. Malnad is well known for its forests and forest-based industries and the other three sides are known for their agricultural products including cotton, groundnut and oil seeds, as well as manganese ore and granite. The establishment of a new-generation diesel locomotive shed in the city by Indian Railways was another major boost for development of industries in this region, as it was first of its kind in Indian Railways history. The diesel locomotive shed at Hubli is the largest holder of EMD locomotives in India and was set up in 1880.http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/uploads/directorate/mec_engg/downloads/DLS/swr/Brief%20history%20of%20the%20shed- UBL.pdf Demographics The population of the twin cities as per provisional figures of Census 2011 is 943,857 and is urban. Hubli-Dharwad's population increased by 22.99% between 1981 and 1991, from 527,108 to 648,298, and by 21.2% between 1991 and 2001. The municipality covers 213 km¬≤.  Education  B.V.

It is situated on Gokul Road, 8 kilometres from city center and from Dharwad. It is the third busiest airport in Karnataka after Bangalore & Mangalore (both are International Airports), the 45th busiest airport in India. In March 2020, Hubli airport received the best airport award under government of India‚Äôs Regional connectivity scheme.Hubli airport Soon gets the International status = Rail = South Western Railway headquarters, Hubli railway station The city currently has four stations and one Junction. The Hubli Junction railway station is the main railway station in the city with a built-up area of 161460 sq.ft. The other stations are Hubli South, Unkal, Amargol and Navalur. Hubli is the headquarters of the South Western Railway zone. It was carved out as a zone from the current South Central Railway. It is the centre for the Hubli Division. The Hubli Division is one of the highest revenue-generating divisions in India. Hubli is well- connected by the Indian Rail Network. Several express, superfast and Jan Shatabdi trains ply between Hubli and Bangalore every day. Hubli, an important railway junction, has daily trains connecting with major towns across the country. In November 2019, the work for extending a platform was undertaken by the Railways at the estimated cost of 90 Cr. According to railway officials, the length of the renewed platform is estimated at 1,400 meters, which would be longest in the world. The work is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2020.Hubbali also has a Heritage Rail museum. The Indian Railways currently has 11 railway museums across the country.For bringing glory to the proposed Rail Museum, narrow-gauge Railway Rolling Stocks, from different Railways are being displayed and work is moving at a rapid pace. It is proposed to collect photographs of Rail network going back to the 19th and early 20th century so that all old memories of Rail Journey can be part of the photo gallery in the proposed Rail Heritage Museum. = Road = Hubli lies on the \\"Golden Quadrilateral\\". Asian Highway 47 passes through Hubli. It lies on National Highway 63 (Ankola - Gooty) and National Highway 218 (Hubli - Humnabad) which connect Hubli with major cities in the region. NWKRTC (North West Karnataka Road Transport Corporation) is a state-run corporation headquartered at Hubli.A semi ring road connecting NH4(Pune - Bangalore), NH67(Ankola - Gooty) and NH218 (Hubli - Humnabad) is already under construction.  Hubli-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System  Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS (also known as HDBRTS) is a bus rapid transit system built to serve the twin cities ofH ubli and Dharwad, located in the North-Western part of Karnataka state in India. Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS (HDBRTS) project is a Government of Karnataka initiative to foster long term economic growth in the region. The project promotes fast, safe, comfortable, convenient and affordable public transportation between the twin cities and aims to reduce congestion and air pollution in the region. The length of the Hubballi-Dharwad BRTS corridor is 22.25 km from CBT Hubli to CBT‚ÄìDharwad with the width of the cross-sections ranging from 44m to 35m. The BRTS corridor includes segregated bus lanes, access-controlled bus stations, physical and fare integration with BRT feeder services, off-board ticketing through smart cards and bar-coded paper tickets, intelligent transport system and high-quality buses (Standard AC buses). The corridor is designed for operating regular and express services. It consists of 2 lanes for BRTS buses on either side of the median bus station facilitating overtaking lanes for express services. Foot overbridges at six locations, PELICAN signals, and synchronised signal management are proposed to facilitate the easy approach of passengers to bus stations.Hubli-Dharwad Bus Rapid Transit System  Notable people  * Gururaj Deshpande, co-founder of Sycamore Networks, the Deshpande Center for Technological Innovation at MIT and the Deshpande Foundation * Launceston Elliot, weightlifter and gold medallist at the 1896 Olympic Games * Gangubai Hangal, Hindustani classical vocalist and Padma Vibhushan awardee * Bhimsen Joshi, Hindustani classical vocalist and Bharat Ratna awardee * Siddappa Kambli, politician who played an important role in the Karnataka Ekikarna Movement * Vivek Kulkarni, chairman of Brickwork India and founder MD of Brickwork Ratings * Rao Sahib Ganpatrao Narayanrao Madiman, businessman and banker * Sudha Murthy, founder and chairperson of Infosys Foundation * Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys * Vijay Sankeshwar, Chairman and Managing Director of VRL Group See also * Kendriya Vidyalaya No. 1, Hubli ReferencesExternal links * Hubli - Dharwad Municipal Corporation * Hubli-Dharwad * Category: Articles containing potentially dated statements from 2001 Category: All articles containing potentially dated statements Category: Hubli-Dharwad Category: Cities in Karnataka ","title":"Hubli"},{"id":"167186","text":"The Mersey Ferry is a ferry service operating on the River Mersey in north west England, between Liverpool to the east and Birkenhead and Wallasey on the Wirral Peninsula to the west. Ferries have been used on this route since at least the 12th century, and continue to be popular for both local people and visitors. The current fleet consists of two vessels. A third ferry, Royal Daffodil was in service until 2012. The current ferries originally came into service in the 1960s and were named Mountwood and Woodchurch. Both ferries have been extensively refurbished and renamed Royal Iris of the Mersey and Snowdrop. The ferries share the workload of cross-river ferrying, charter cruises and the Manchester Ship Canal cruise. The service is operated by Merseytravel, under the ‚ÄúMersey Ferries‚Äù brand. History=Medieval ferries= In about 1150, the Benedictine Priory at Birkenhead was established. The monks used to charge a small fare to row passengers across the river. At this time, the Mersey was considerably wider with sand dunes and marshes to the north leading up to Ainsdale beach and sandstone cliffs and shorelines to the south near Otterspool. The only suitable landing point for the ferry was in the Pool, near the site of the present Merseyside Police headquarters. Weather often stopped crossings and passengers were delayed for days, taking shelter at the priory. In 1317, a royal licence was issued, granting permission to the Priory to build lodging houses for men crossing the river at Woodside. King Edward II visited Liverpool in 1323, and the royal accounts show that he used local ferrymen to sail up the river to Ince. In 1330, his son Edward III granted a charter to the Priory and its successors for ever: \\"the right of ferry there‚Ä¶ for men, horses and goods, with leave to charge reasonable tolls\\". At the time, there was only a small hamlet at Birkenhead, and a slightly larger village at Liverpool. The Chester Indictments record criminal activities on the Mersey ferries in the 14th and early 15th centuries. In 1355, Richard, son of Simon de Becheton, was murdered on the ferry; the murderers escaped and took refuge at Shotwick. In 1365, it was recorded that there were four ferryboats operating without a licence, from Bromborough and Eastham. In 1414, William de Stanley, the servant of John Talbot, later Earl of Shrewsbury, was on the ferry between Birkenhead and Liverpool when about 200 men assaulted him, and stole his bay horse valued at ¬£5 (current value - over ¬£2,800), a bow and 14 arrows valued at 3s 4d (current value - over ¬£95) and a barge valued at ¬£10 (current value - over ¬£5,700). The thieves were fined. A licence was issued in 1357 to the Poole family by Edward, the Black Prince, for a ferry from Eastham. The licence then passed to the Abbey of St Werburgh, in Chester, and became known as Job's Ferry. Early ferries also existed across the Mersey further upstream, at Ince and at Runcorn. Map from 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, showing ferry routes =From the 16th to the 18th century= The monks of Birkenhead Priory operated a ferry service until the Dissolution of the Monasteries and the priory's destruction by Henry VIII's troops in 1536. Ownership reverted to the Crown, and in 1544 the ferry rights as well as the Priory properties were bought by Ralph Worsley of Lancashire for ¬£586. 11s. 6d (current value - almost ¬£205,000). The rights later passed to the Molyneux family. By 1541 William Bromley had the licence for ferries at Seacombe, and in 1586, Queen Elizabeth granted John Poole of Sutton the rights at Tranmere. During this period, the private owners began to use fully rigged sailing ships. The use of sailing ships meant that bigger vessels could be employed, but in reality these boats were even more at the bidding of the weather. The Mersey is famed for its thick fogs, and during these times during winter there was little wind and ferries could not operate. The frequency depended on demand and the weather. By the 18th century, the commercial expansion of Liverpool and the increase in stage coach traffic from Chester spurred the growth of the transportation of passengers and goods across the river. Ferry services from Rock House on the Wirral ‚Äì that is, Rock Ferry ‚Äì were first recorded in 1709. By 1753 the Cheshire side of the Mersey had at least five ferry houses at Ince, Eastham, the Rock, Woodside and Seacombe. The service from New Ferry to Liverpool was first mentioned in 1774. =Steam ferries= The first steamship to operate on the Mersey was the Elizabeth, a wooden paddle steamer, which was introduced in 1815 to operate between Liverpool and Runcorn. There was considerable debate as to the best way of boarding a ferry vessel. For the steam ferry Etna, which entered service at Tranmere on 17 April 1817, the idea of extension stages was mooted. These were long piers that were mounted on wheels and, by using a steam engine, could be wheeled in and out depending on the level of the tide. At Woodside, a small slipway was built on the beach to allow the boats to berth, and in 1822 the paddle steamer Royal Mail began commercial operation between Liverpool and Woodside. The town of Birkenhead was just starting to develop at this point. In 1820, the Birkenhead Ferry began operating from a new site just to the south; this closed in 1870. The Woodside, North Birkenhead and Liverpool Steam Ferry Company was formed in 1835, and the slipway at Woodside was widened and constructed as a stone pier. In 1838, the Monks Ferry Company began operating rival ferries from a new stone slip and hotel about 400 metres south of Woodside, but this service closed in 1878. From about 1830, steam ferries also operated from the new resort developed by James Atherton at New Brighton, and from nearby Egremont. Steam ferries also began operating from Eastham. By the 1840s, Birkenhead was developing into a busy new town. The railway to Chester had opened, the town was growing quickly, and the docks were under construction. There were also competing ferry services and disputes over the rights granted to the monks, and there was a need to improve the facilities at Woodside. In the early 1840s, the old slipway was replaced with a new stone pier with a small lighthouse at the end. However, this soon became inadequate. In 1847, the first floating landing stage, which rose and fell with the tide so that boats could dock at any time, was opened at Liverpool. The first portion, known as the Georges' landing stage, was designed by William Cubitt and was 500 feet long. It was rebuilt and extended in 1874. =The Corporation Years= Until the establishment of the Mersey Railway in 1886, the ferries were the only means of crossing the river, and so all of the routes were heavily used. All of the ferry routes were owned by private interests before coming under municipal ownership in the mid 19th century. The Woodside ferry was taken over by the Birkenhead Commissioners in 1858 and, in 1861, the Wallasey Local Board took over the ferry services at Seacombe, Egremont and New Brighton. At Woodside, land between the Woodside Hotel and the end of the old pier was reclaimed, and in 1861 the floating landing stage was opened. The pontoons were towed into position, moored by chains originally made for the SS Great Eastern, and linked to the mainland by two double bridges. The Cheshire, the first passenger ferry steamer to have a saloon, operated from Woodside in 1864. The iron pier at Eastham was built in 1874. On 26 November 1878, the ferry Gem, a paddle steamer operated from Seacombe by the Wallasey Local Board, collided with the Bowfell, a wooden sailing ship at anchor on the River Mersey; five people died as a result. In 1886 the Mersey Railway Tunnel was opened, providing competition for the ferry services. The Woodside ferry service began using twin-screw passenger steamers in 1890, which replaced paddle steamers. In 1894 trains were carrying 25,000 passengers per day and the ferries 44,000 per day. The ferry service at Tranmere, which had operated since mediaeval times, closed in 1897. The pier and landing stage at Rock Ferry was built in 1899, and Birkenhead Corporation also operated the ferry service at New Ferry. In 1914 King George V and Queen Mary travelled on the ferry S.S. Daffodil from Wallasey to Liverpool. During the First World War the steamers Iris and Daffodil were taken out of service from Wallasey to be used as troop ships in the naval raid on Zeebrugge in Belgium. The ferries had a shallow draft, allowing them to skim over the mines floating beneath the surface, and were robust enough to approach the heavily defended mole curling into the North Sea. They both saw action, which was described on 24 April 1918 by Vice‚ÄìAdmiral Sir Roger Keyes of the Royal Navy in a message to the ferries' manager: > \\"I am sure it will interest you to know that your two stout vessels carried > Bluejackets and Marines to Zeebrugge, and remained alongside the Mole for an > hour, greatly contributing to the success of the operation... The damage > caused by enemy gun fire has been repaired\\". Because of their work King George V allowed the vessels to use the word \\"Royal\\" in their name. They needed extensive refitting before they could resume peacetime activities. In the boats themselves, there was quick development. The early incarnations of today's modern vessels can be seen in some of the early propeller driven ships, mainly the 1906 pair, Royal Iris and Royal Daffodil. The Wallasey twin screw vessels all had flying bridges with port and starboard docking cabs. As built, the two ferries still had the wheel at promenade deck level, however this was subsequently moved up onto the bridge so navigation was all on one level. They were all fitted with ahead and astern reciprocating engines and most vessels could achieve a speed of around 12 knots, which is about the same as today's trio of ferries. On early paddlers, the wheelhouse and side cabs were open largely due to the transition from sail to steam, and most ships at the time had open navigation bridges with the ferries being no different. Birkenhead did not use flying bridges, instead having a central wheelhouse and two outer navigation boxes which were raised up higher above deck level. Wallasey ferries employed a funnel livery of white and black and Birkenhead red and black. Birkenhead changed to orange and black after the second world war. When the railway tunnels were constructed and opened, the ferry service did suffer somewhat but it always remained popular. It was really the advent of the road tunnels that caused trouble. When the Queensway road tunnel opened in 1934, the ferry service from Seacombe lost two million passengers because people started to use the tunnel rather than the ferry. The opening of the road tunnel also had an effect on the luggage boats which were introduced in 1879. Both ferry companies earned a substantial amount from luggage boats, which carried vehicles and goods across the river. When the road tunnel opened, traffic dropped by 80%. By the 1940s, luggage boat services from both Woodside and Seacombe to Liverpool had ceased. From Woodside in 1941 and from Seacombe 1947. Due to financial losses incurred from a gradual reduction in patronage, Birkenhead Corporation gradually closed its southern terminals; New Ferry (officially) on 22 September 1927, Eastham in 1929 and Rock Ferry on 30 June 1939. The closure of Eastham marked the last use of ferry paddle steamers on the river. Wallasey were always trying to close Egremont, but faced stiff opposition from locals who got petitions to keep the ferry open. The chance came to close Egremont during the Second World War for economical reasons, after the pier was damaged in a collision. This was in similar circumstances to the demise of New Ferry twenty years earlier. As a result, the Egremont service never reopened. In 1941, mines which had drifted into the River Mersey stopped ferry crossings. The Oxton and Bebington vessels were fitted with cranes to enable them to unload United States aircraft from mid-river and deliver them to the Liverpool landing stage. The Upton vessel was taken by the army and used as a ferry and supply vessel for the anti-aircraft forts in Liverpool Bay. In 1950, the ferries carried almost 30 million passengers a year, including 11 million on the Woodside ferries and 15 million on Seacombe ferries, but by 1970 the total number fell to 7 million. Night boats across the river were withdrawn and replaced by buses through the tunnel in 1956. =The MPTE takes over= Snowdrop at Irlam Locks on the Manchester Ship Canal As a result of the Transport Act 1968, the transport functions of both Wallasey and Birkenhead Corporations came under the control of the Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive (MPTE) on 1 December 1969. By this time, New Brighton had declined as a tourist destination and coupled with silting problems near the landing stage, the ferry service was withdrawn in 1971, with the stage and pier subsequently demolished. In spite of the close proximity of Wallasey and Birkenhead and their respective ferry landing stages, each corporation had used different gangway spacing on their vessels. This meant that a Wallasey ferry could not utilise both gangways at Birkenhead's terminal at Woodside, and that a Birkenhead boat would be similarly disadvantaged at Seacombe and New Brighton. The Pier Head at Liverpool was obliged to have gangways to suit both sets of ships. When the combined ferry fleet was rationalised, Seacombe Ferry landing stage required the construction of an additional gangway to cater for the Birkenhead vessels. The 1970s economic situation in Britain saw costs escalating, with funding limited by the MPTE, which was embarking on an expensive operation to construct the Merseyrail \\"Liverpool Loop\\" extension. Compounded with the opening of the Kingsway road tunnel on 28 June 1971 and a further decline in passenger numbers (only 4,000-5,000 a day), the future of the service was uncertain. It was sentimental, rather than economical grounds which resulted in the retention of the ferries, after much public protest to keep them. However, service frequency was reduced, with ferry fares being linked to bus and rail fares. During this period, maintenance on the ferries was limited considerably, with the Woodchurch being laid up as a salvage for parts for Mountwood and Overchurch. At this time, the large brass helm from Overchurch was damaged and was replaced by that from Woodchurch. After the damaged helm was repaired, it was placed on Woodchurch. This has remained the case, even after both vessels were extensively rebuilt. 1984 was a momentous year for the ferries and can be seen as the beginning of their rise from the slump of the 1970s. For the duration of the International Garden Festival, a special ferry service was provided to Otterspool Promenade. This service was usually operated by the Overchurch. The ferries also began to operate summer Manchester Ship Canal cruises, a service which had been popular for many year since the canal opened, but declined somewhat in the 1960s and 1970s. Sailing ships from the Tall Ships' Race visited the river in August 1984, which helped bring patronage to 250,000 over four days, a level unseen for forty years. =Bus deregulation and the 1990 changes= On 26 October 1986 as a result of the Transport Act 1985, bus services were deregulated and restrictions which prevented regular bus services through the Mersey Tunnels were abolished. As a result, many buses which formerly stopped at the Birkenhead Woodside Bus/Ferry terminal were extended into Liverpool. This was another blow to the Mersey Ferries and the ferry service had to be re-focussed away from commuter traffic, which had declined, to tourist needs. From 1990 a commuter shuttle has operated Monday-Friday peak period with an hourly River Explorer Cruise. At weekends River Explorer cruises operate from 10:00 to 18:00. The morning peak service until 2010 ran every 30 minutes on a Liverpool-Birkehead- Seacombe-Liverpool circuit, but since then only runs every 20 minutes from Liverpool-Seacombe Ferry and back. The evening peak service runs Liverpool- Seacombe every 20 minutes. The Explorer cruises follow a Liverpool-Seacombe- Birkenhead-Liverpool pattern and sail slightly further upstream with a commentary of what can be seen. These operations run with a bias towards Seacombe Ferry as the vicinity of Seacombe lacks the rail and bus connections of Birkenhead. In the summer there are also cruises up the Manchester Ship Canal. Previous and present fleets=The Royal family= The \\"Royal\\" prefix was granted to the ferries Iris and Daffodil for their service during the First World War where they were instrumental at the Mole in Zeebrugge. Both ferries were badly damaged but returned home to a triumphant greeting. Since the original duo's withdrawal, there have been other Royals. The Royal Daffodil II was hit by a bomb and sunk at her berth in the Second World War, but later raised and returned to service, with little of her pre-war splendour. Perhaps the most famous Royal is the Royal Iris of 1951. She was the best loved of all the Mersey ferries. She was the first diesel powered vessel of the Wallasey fleet. She had four diesel generators connected to two Metrovick marine propulsion units. She differed to all the other ferries as she had super smooth lines and a dummy funnel in place. She played host to hundreds of party cruises and bands such as Gerry & The Pacemakers, The Searchers, The Beatles and also Elvis Costello. She received a major refit in the 1970s and her popular fish and chip cafe - which earned her the name \\"the fish and chip boat\\" - was removed and replaced with a steak bar. The Royal Iris remained in service for nearly 40 years before being sold in 1993 - two years after withdrawal - for use as a floating nightclub. She is now berthed at Woolwich, London. Attempts to bring her back to Merseyside have come to nothing due to the prohibitive cost of making her fit for a 1,000 mile journey coastwise. =Leasowe, Egremont and Royal Daffodil II= Salcombe Harbour The Leasowe and Egremont were built by Philip and Co. in Dartmouth, Devon and entered service in late 1951 and early 1952 respectively. Named after suburbs of Wallasey, both vessels were commissioned by Wallasey Corporation. They were of a traditional design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough, who are based in Liverpool, but boasted modern equipment including Crossley multi- speed engines for versatile control. They only had one single boarding gangway and their forward saloons extended to the whole width of the ship. This proved somewhat problematic especially at busy periods, so an additional gangway space was added on the promenade deck for use with the high level terminal gangways. The forward saloons also had facility for a bar area and dance floor, which meant the vessels could be used for cruising. The two vessels were primarily used on the Seacombe - Liverpool service, augmenting the New Brighton run during the summer seasons. Egremont differed externally to Leasowe in that she had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of Leasowe and Egremont show them to have deckhead compasses above the wheelhouse and side boxes, which appear to have been removed in the late 1950s. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system and a ship to shore radio system. Similar types of navigation equipment and deck fittings used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. The Royal Daffodil II was constructed by James Lamont and Co. at Greenock and entered service in 1957. She was larger than the Dartmouth pair as she had three decks and was designed for the dual role of ferry and cruise service. The gross tonnage of Royal Daffodil II was 609. A gross error was the size of her engines, developing 1,360 bhp a piece she was underpowered and often struggled in strong tides. Aside from the engine order telegraphs, she also had helms in the side boxes meaning that the ship could be steered from them if required. The Roman II was added to her name because of a Thames estuary cruise ship also called Royal Daffodil which existed from 1939 until 1967 (see MV Royal Daffodil (1939)). With the merger of the Wallasey and Birkenhead fleets in 1969, the ferries lost their Wallasey colours to be replaced with the primrose yellow and powder blue of the MPTE, and latterly emerald green and black. In the mid-1970s, Leasowe and Royal Daffodil II were sold to Greek owners and have been heavily modified since. The Leasowe is still cruising around the Greek Islands. The former Royal Daffodil II was converted to a container ship, but still retained its forward section largely in its original condition. The ferry reportedly sank in November 2007, 20 miles off the coast of Cape Andreas, in heavy seas. The cause of the sinking was main engine and steering gear failure, and she claimed the lives of both her captain and mate. The Egremont was laid up in Morpeth Dock whilst on sale offer and in fact sprang a leak which flooded her engine room and ruined her engines rendering her inoperable. She was stripped of her machinery and towed to Salcombe, where she was used as a floating headquarters for the Island Cruising Club in Salcombe, Devon, not far from her original birthplace. As of April 2019, the vessel is no longer in use by the ICC and has been offered for sale. =Mountwood, Woodchurch and Overchurch= The current Mersey Ferries fleet comprises two vessels, based on a similar design by naval architects Graham and Woolnough of Liverpool. Until 2012 a third ferry, Royal Daffodil, was also in service. Originally named Mountwood, Woodchurch and Overchurch after overspill post-war housing developments of Birkenhead. They were commissioned into service by Birkenhead Corporation. Mountwood and Woodchurch were built at Dartmouth by Philip and Son. The Mountwood was launched on the 31 July 1959 and the Woodchurch on the 28 October of the same year. They were loosely based on designs of the Leasowe and Egremont of the Wallasey fleet, although they both weighed considerably more at 464 tonnes, compared with 311 tonnes for the earlier vessels. They are also larger than the older Wallasey pair, being approximately 19 feet longer, 6 feet broader and over a foot taller. Both vessels were externally identical in almost every way up until 1991 when the shroud protecting the aft funnel vent on the Mountwood was changed from square to rounded. Compared to the earlier Wallasey twins, the Mountwood and Woodchurch were highly advanced. They benefited from an injection of cash from both Birkenhead Corporation and the Joint Tunnel Committee. They were given special Crossley eight-cylinder engines which were fitted with gears and automatic air brakes. New style telegraphs by Chadburns were designed which had a facility for braking the engines for rapid reversal, the telegraphs were part of a brand known as \\"Synchrostep\\" and were all originally unpainted brushed aluminium with shiny brass rimming. Overchurch had the same telegraph 'heads' however they were fitted into the wings and main control position in specially built units which also had instruments fitted to them. They entered service in 1960 and were a hit with ferry passengers. They were light, modern and boasted the latest in marine navigation equipment. They were given an orange and black funnel livery, with a red band just above the rubbing strake. In their early years of service both the ferries carried rope fenders to protect the strakes. On the bridge was also a brass talk tube that linked down to the engine room. A prank amongst bridge crews was to call an engineer on the talk tube then pour water down it, thus soaking the engineer at the other end. The Mountwood was used in the film \\"Ferry Cross The Mersey\\", a musical and subsequent Gerry & The Pacemakers song, crossing to Liverpool from Birkenhead. Her near sister Overchurch also appeared in the background of several shots. In her early years Mountwood was an unreliable ship. She had broken down whilst crossing the river and had to anchor. Her passengers were rescued by Woodchurch. She also collided with Bidston whilst berthing, due to an error in engine movements. In 1962, Mountwood and Woodchurch were joined by a new ferry, the Overchurch. Built at the Birkenhead shipyard of Cammell Laird and Co., Overchurch was of all welded construction and also had a bridge that was completely enclosed rather than a wheelhouse and navigation boxes like Mountwood and Woodchurch. The addition of a totally enclosed bridge meant that there only needed to be one binnacle upon it, whereas on the two sisters there were three, one inside the main wheelhouse and two in the docking/navigation boxes. The Overchurch also had much of its instrumentation fitted into specially built units, meaning the ferry had a spacious bridge, rather than the more compact and cluttered bridges of the Mountwood and Woodchurch. Overchurch had a high funnel immediately behind the bridge and also a small bridge deck, giving the appearance of a somewhat forward top-heavy look, as a result. The Overchurch was fitted with the same navigation equipment as her near sisters. She differed slightly by being a few tonnes heavier and a few inches longer. The Overchurch also had only one access stairway to the promenade deck unlike the Dartmouth twins which had two. In 1962, the Overchurch conveyed Princess Alexandra to open the new Cammell Laird dry dock. The trio of ferries all remained in near constant operation up until 1981, when cost-cutting measures saw Woodchurch withdrawn for almost three years. It was rumoured that she was cannibalised to help keep her sisters running. Whilst in lay up at Clarence dry docks, she was offered for sale, with one prospective buyer hoping to use her to operate cruises around the Isle of Man. She was not sold and after main engine repairs and a full repaint Woodchurch returned to service in 1983, freeing up Overchurch to become the primary ferry to be used on a new Otterspool service, set up for the 1984 International Garden Festival. The ferries all operated on a normal 20 minute route throughout this. When the ferries were taken over by the PTE, they lost their original liveries and these were swiftly replaced with sky blue and primrose yellow. This was in turn replaced with black and green, and then colours of the Union Jack for the Garden Festival. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw very limited budgets for maintenance and the ferries are noted to look in poor condition during this period. In 1989, Mountwood and Woodchurch were withdrawn and extensively refurbished internally which resulted in complete rewiring and main engine repairs. They were given new modern interiors and their separate bridge wings and wheel houses were plated over to form one large bridge, although none of the original equipment was removed from the new bridge. They entered service by July 1990 in time for the QE2's first visit to the Mersey and also operated the new \\"heritage cruises\\". They also were given a new black and red livery replacing the red white and blue given for the Garden Festival season of 1984. The Overchurch also underwent some refurbishments at Bootle. She was then moved to the ferries' regular berth on the East Float, where she was used as a stand by vessel and during the busy summer season. In 1996 the Overchurch was given a small refit which involved the enclosing of the promenade deck shelter. =Liveries= Snowdrop in her \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" livery in 2015 The ferries companies were identifiable by their different colour liveries displayed on each vessel's funnel. Wallasey ferries carried a black and white colour scheme. Early Birkenhead steamers carried red and black, however this appears to have changed to orange in the 1920s or 1930s and this remained up until the merger of the two fleets under the MPTE in 1969. From January 2015, MV Snowdrop had a special livery applied, based on the World War I dazzle camouflage and designed by Peter Blake. =Refits and renamings= Royal Iris of the Mersey & Snowdrop berthed at East Float, Wallasey The Overchurch was given her major refit in 1998 at Lengthline Ship Repairers in Manchester, which resulted in a major rebuilding of all decks and fitting of new engines and navigation equipment. She was renamed Royal Daffodil and returned to service in 1999. Mountwood and Woodchurch were also refitted and renamed Royal Iris of the Mersey and Snowdrop, respectively in 2002 and 2004. The ferries were re-designed by their original architects - Graham and Woolnough. When all three vessels were refitted, the previously used helms and binnacles with compasses were placed back on the refurbished bridges. The current two ferries have been in service for nearly 60 years and 2019 sees the 60th anniversary of the launching of Royal Iris of the Mersey and the Snowdrop. This remarkable service life is testament to the dedication and care taken by the ferries' staff over the years to keep the boats in the conditions they can be found today. The refitting of the ferries has extended their working lives by approximately thirty years, and this is steadily increasing with additional repairs that are carried out on the boats on a regular basis. The new W√§rtsil√§ engines fitted on the ferries are much more economical than the previous engines by Crossley Bros of Manchester. They are also much 'greener' and produce much less emissions than the original propulsion units. The ferries' masts now carry several other navigation lights on their main masts at various points. Prior to refit, they had only a forward-facing white light. This is due to the classification of the ferries. The Snowdrop and Royal Iris each carry two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/165 type fog horns. Royal Daffodil carries two Kockums Super Tyfon TA 100/195 horns. These are the original horns fitted when the ferries were first built. Both Royal Iris of the Mersey and Snowdrop have an E-flat tone, and Royal Daffodil's is in F Sharp. When berthing the vessel, the captain uses a combination of rudder positions and engine movements. The ferries all have twin rudders and propellers, making them very maneuverable. The Mersey Ferries used to operate in fog, however currently the service is usually suspended when visibility is very poor. Liverpool 08 The ferries played a big part in Liverpool's European Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. The ferries carried record numbers of passengers, and on the 18‚Äì21 July, the Tall Ships returned to the Mersey. A combination of the Tall Ships and the Golf Open at nearby Royal Birkdale ensured over 1 million visitors to the city over the weekend, with many of these taking a trip on the famous ferries. Sunday 20 July saw an unusual sight of all three ferries out on the river at night, with the Snowdrop being berthed at Woodside and the Royal Iris and Royal Daffodil at Seacombe. All three ferries were packed to capacity over the weekend, with the Royal Daffodil operating a special cruise to witness the parade of sail and departure of the ships on Monday 21 July. Future In August 2012, it was announced that Merseytravel were initiating a review into cost saving on Mersey Ferries operations after the service is running at a ¬£1 million annual loss. As a result of this review, the ferry Royal Daffodil was withdrawn from service in January 2013. Another threat to the ferries' future is the cost of replacing the current ferries, the oldest ever to ply the river, when required. In December 2015 Merseytravel announced a 20-year plan for the ferries which included the possible closure of one of the two Wirral landing stages (possibly Woodside), a later start to commuter services which only operate from Seacombe to Liverpool, and one or two new vessels with better ability to hold social functions or musical events, a facility not available since the disposal of the 1951 Royal Iris. \\"Mersey ferry terminal could close, 20-year plan reveals\\", BBC News, 16 December 2015 The Mersey Ferries Long Term Strategy, whilst currently subject to approval, anticipates that a naval architect will be appointed with the intention of having a new vessel ready for service in 2020‚Äì21. The vessel will be used as the main day to day vessel with Snowdrop used as a secondary vessel. In January 2018, the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, Steve Rotheram announced that plans had been drawn up for a new vessel. The announcement stated that naval architects had prepared initial designs and there would be a period of public consultation on the designs. Plans were announced in August 2019 for two new low-carbon ferries to be built and for improvement works to take place at Seacombe ferry terminal. By using a share of a ¬£172m 'Transforming Cities Fund', it is hoped that at least one of the two ferries will be in service by 2022. Cultural references \\"Ferry Cross the Mersey\\" was a 1964 song, film, and soundtrack album. The song was written by Gerry Marsden, recorded by Gerry & The Pacemakers and was a hit in both the UK and US. In 1989, a charity version of the song was recorded by Liverpool artists The Christians, Holly Johnson, Paul McCartney, Gerry Marsden, and Stock Aitken Waterman, and was released in aid of those affected by the Hillsborough disaster. It was number one in the UK chart for three weeks. The ferries also featured in the opening credit sequences of the popular BBC TV comedy series, The Liver Birds, written by Carla Lane, which ran from 1969 to 1979. The ferry depicted was the Royal Daffodil II. The ferries were referred to repeatedly in Helen Forrester's 1974 book Twopence to Cross the Mersey, because the fare for a journey to the Wirral (two pence) was too expensive for a destitute Liverpool family to afford during the Great Depression.

Locally, it is often referred to as the Birkenhead tunnel or old tunnel, to distinguish it from the newer Kingsway tunnel (1971), which serves Wallasey and the M53 motorway traffic. History George's Dock ventilation and control station, Pier Head The first tunnel under the River Mersey was for the Mersey Railway in 1886. The first tunnel crossing was proposed in 1825, and again in 1827. A report in 1830 rejected the road tunnel due to concerns about building damage. During the 1920s there were concerns about the long queues of cars and lorries at the Mersey Ferry terminal, so once Royal Assent to a Parliamentary Bill was received, construction of the first Mersey road tunnel started in 1925, to a design by consulting engineer Sir Basil Mott. Mott supervised the construction in association with John Brodie, who, as City Engineer of Liverpool, had co- ordinated the feasibility studies made by consultant Engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. The main contractor was Edmund Nuttall. In 1928 the two pilot tunnels met to within less than . The tunnel entrances, toll booths and ventilation building exteriors were designed by architect Herbert James Rowse, who is frequently but incorrectly credited with the whole civil engineering project. Their decoration is by Edmund Thompson. These are Grade II listed buildings. More than 1.2 million tons of rock, gravel, and clay were excavated; some of it was used to build Otterspool Promenade. Of the 1,700 men who worked on the tunnel during the nine years of its construction, 17 were killed. At the time of its opening it was the longest road tunnel in the world, a title it held for 14 years until the opening of the Vielha Tunnel in Catalonia, Spain in 1948, though it remained the longest underwater tunnel as of 1955. The tunnel, which cost a total of ¬£8 million, was opened on 18 July 1934 by King George V; the opening ceremony was watched by 200,000 people. At the time it was known as the eighth wonder of the world. By the 1960s, traffic volume had increased, and, in 1971, the Kingsway tunnel opened to relieve congestion. Description Toll booths at the Birkenhead entrance to the Queensway tunnel One of the original Art Deco lamp pillars from Birkenhead, now the Monument to the Mersey Tunnel The tunnel is long. It contains a single carriageway of four lanes, two in each direction. Different height restrictions apply to the nearside and offside lanes in each direction, because of the curvature of the tunnel. These are and respectively, and there is a 3.5 t weight limit for goods vehicles. All buses are required to use the offside lane, regardless of their height. Lane signals (consisting of an illuminated green arrow or red cross) are displayed at regular intervals, although in normal circumstances none of the lanes are currently used bidirectionally. This is in contrast to the Kingsway Tunnel, where lanes in toll concourse are alternated to prioritise higher traffic in one direction during peak hours. The tunnel has two branches leading off the main tunnel to the dock areas on both sides of the river. The Birkenhead branch tunnel (known as the Rendel Street branch, or Dock Exit) was closed in 1965. When travelling in the Birkenhead direction, the branch can still be seen inside the tunnel on the right just before the left hand bend towards the Birkenhead exit. The exit of this branch can also be seen on the outside from Rendel Street near the junction with Marcus Street, just north of Cleveland Street in Birkenhead. This branch also carried 2 way traffic, single lane each way. It was also controlled by traffic lights inside the tunnel. This branch mainly served Birkenhead docks and for people travelling to the Wirral resort of New Brighton. These are now best served by the Kingsway tunnel. The Liverpool branch tunnel remains in use, in the exit direction only. It emerges opposite the Liver Building, next to the Atlantic Tower Hotel and Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas. Originally, it carried two-way traffic and the junction inside the tunnel was controlled by traffic lights, but this arrangement was discontinued to reduce the delays brought on by increasing traffic levels. The lighting inside the tunnel was updated in 1981 to replace the amber fluorescent tubes on the walls of the tunnel. The reason given for the change was that the old lighting was ineffective and inefficient. It also caused a flicker effect on vehicle windscreens, which could induce epileptic reactions in susceptible people. =Tolls= An original tollbooth, now preserved in Liverpool Tolls have been a feature of tunnel use since the Queensway Tunnel opened in 1934. Although residents were originally told tolls would be removed when debts were repaid, this position was dropped long ago. Debts and tolls were increased when the Kingsway Tunnel was built in 1971 to relieve congestion in the first tunnel. The County of Merseyside Act 1980 enshrined in law the right to continue collecting tolls once the debts were repaid. The later 2004 Act created a legal position where tolls charged must rise in line with the Retail Price Index (RPI) as published in November.David Bartlett (10 January 2013) \\"Mersey Tunnels still owe ¬£58m but tolls income is being used elsewhere\\" Liverpool Echo: Retrieved 6 December 2019 =Ventilation= As a roadway the tunnel requires ventilation to clear vehicle exhaust fumes. As originally designed the tunnel would have used forced air for ventilation; fumes and noxious gases were simply to be expelled through the tunnel exits. However in an incident in the Liberty Tunnel in Pittsburgh in May 1924, inadequate ventilation led to a number of drivers being overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning, though there were no fatalities; this led the Queensway engineers to re-examine the issue and to conduct experiments in a completed section under Hamilton Square. This led to the installation of extractors in the planned ventilation stations, adding to their size and complexity, and also adding considerably to the budget.Ian Jackson, Simon Pepper, Peter Richmond Herbert Rowse, p46 (2019) Historic England The tunnel currently has six ventilation shafts, three on each side of the river. On the Wirral side the main shaft is at Woodside, with another (before the main exit) in Sidney Street, while the Dock Exit branch is served by the tower in Taylor Street. On the Liverpool side the main shaft is at the Pier head, in the George's Dock Building, with another (before the main exit) in North John Street, and the Strand Exit branch is served by the tower in Fazakerley Street. The Georges Dock Building also houses offices of the Tunnels Authority and of the Tunnels Police Force. All the ventilation buildings were designed by Herbert Rowse, chief architect for the Queensway tunnel exteriors, and all are Grade II listed.

Each refuge is long and wide, accessible from the main tunnel walls. The refuges have fire resistant doors, ramps for wheelchair access, a supply of bottled water, a toilet, and a video link to the Mersey Tunnels Police control room. All seven refuges are linked by a walkway below the road surface, with exits at the Liverpool and Birkenhead ends. In 2012 the tunnel was refurbished, with 5999 added panels - ceramic steel cladding replacing the old plastic corrugated wall cladding to improve lighting and to give the Tunnel a 21st Century look. As of April 2018 the toll is ¬£1.80 per journey for a single passenger car of typical size, with progressively higher tolls for larger vehicles; solo motorcycles are free. Average daily traffic through the tunnel currently stands at 35,000 vehicles, which equates to just under 12.8 million per year. Use in film In September 2009, a scene from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows ‚Äì Part 1 set in the Dartford Crossing was filmed in Queensway tunnel, where Harry skips on a bus while on Hagrid's enchanted motorbike was filmed in the tunnel. In 2012 the tunnel was used for the filming of a chase scene for Fast & Furious 6. In March 2018, the tunnel was used for the filming of Yesterday, directed by Danny Boyle. The two main characters are frolicking in an empty tunnel when the bright yellow words \\"Hello Goodbye\\" are rolling through the tunnel. Also in 2018 the tunnel was a location for the BBC TV series The City and the City, where it served as the gateway between the two cities. In popular culture The Dubliners popularised the song \\"I Wish I Was Back in Liverpool\\" which includes a verse about the building of the Queensway Tunnel.

The tunnel carries the A59. It was built because the Queensway Tunnel ‚Äì which was built in the 1930s to carry vehicles between Birkenhead and Liverpool ‚Äì was unable to cope with the rise in postwar traffic. Construction The project was authorised by the Mersey Tunnel (Liverpool/Wallasey) etc. Act 1965. Edmund Nuttall Limited began work in 1966.ICE Virtual Tour Construction took five years to complete. The approach to the tunnel on the Wirral side uses the former railway cutting that carried the Seacombe branch line. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 June 1971. At first, only the southernmost tube was open for traffic, one lane in each direction. The northernmost tube was completed in 1974 and opened to traffic on 13 February 1974. Operations Kingsway comprises identical twin tubes. Each has two lanes. They carry on average 45,000 vehicles a day (almost 16.4million per year). , a single car journey through the tunnel currently costs ¬£1.80. Staffed and automatic tollbooths are located on the Wallasey side. Of the two tunnels crossing the River Mersey, Kingsway is the only one able to take heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). In a study following the fire in the Mont Blanc Tunnel in 1999, inspectors from the European Union rated the Kingsway Tunnel as \\"good\\", one of fourteen to receive that rating in Europe. Over of wiring was installed in the tunnel as part of a 2016 upgrade to the lighting, which saw the tunnel fitted with more energy efficient and longer-lasting LED lights.

In 3D computer graphics, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Phong shading\\", particularly if the model is used with the interpolation method of the same name and in the context of pixel shaders or other places where a lighting calculation can be referred to as ‚Äúshading‚Äù.  History  The Phong reflection model was developed by Bui Tuong Phong at the University of Utah, who published it in his 1975 Ph.D. dissertation.Bui Tuong Phong, Illumination for computer generated pictures, Communications of ACM 18 (1975), no. 6, 311‚Äì317.University of Utah School of Computing, http://www.cs.utah.edu/school/history/#phong-ref It was published in conjunction with a method for interpolating the calculation for each individual pixel that is rasterized from a polygonal surface model; the interpolation technique is known as Phong shading, even when it is used with a reflection model other than Phong's. Phong's methods were considered radical at the time of their introduction, but have since become the de facto baseline shading method for many rendering applications. Phong's methods have proven popular due to their generally efficient use of computation time per rendered pixel.  Description  Phong reflection is an empirical model of local illumination. It describes the way a surface reflects light as a combination of the diffuse reflection of rough surfaces with the specular reflection of shiny surfaces. It is based on Phong's informal observation that shiny surfaces have small intense specular highlights, while dull surfaces have large highlights that fall off more gradually. The model also includes an ambient term to account for the small amount of light that is scattered about the entire scene. Visual illustration of the Phong equation: here the light is white, the ambient and diffuse colors are both blue, and the specular color is white, reflecting a small part of the light hitting the surface, but only in very narrow highlights. The intensity of the diffuse component varies with the direction of the surface, and the ambient component is uniform (independent of direction). For each light source in the scene, components i_\\\\text{s} and i_\\\\text{d} are defined as the intensities (often as RGB values) of the specular and diffuse components of the light sources, respectively. A single term i_\\\\text{a} controls the ambient lighting; it is sometimes computed as a sum of contributions from all light sources. For each material in the scene, the following parameters are defined: :k_\\\\text{s}, which is a specular reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the specular term of incoming light, :k_\\\\text{d}, which is a diffuse reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the diffuse term of incoming light (Lambertian reflectance), :k_\\\\text{a}, which is an ambient reflection constant, the ratio of reflection of the ambient term present in all points in the scene rendered, and :\\\\alpha, which is a shininess constant for this material, which is larger for surfaces that are smoother and more mirror-like. When this constant is large the specular highlight is small. Vectors for calculating Phong and Blinn‚ÄìPhong shading Furthermore, we have :\\\\text{lights}, which is the set of all light sources, :\\\\hat{L}_m, which is the direction vector from the point on the surface toward each light source (m specifies the light source), :\\\\hat{N}, which is the normal at this point on the surface, :\\\\hat{R}_m, which is the direction that a perfectly reflected ray of light would take from this point on the surface, and :\\\\hat{V}, which is the direction pointing towards the viewer (such as a virtual camera). Then the Phong reflection model provides an equation for computing the illumination of each surface point I_\\\\text{p}: :I_\\\\text{p} = k_\\\\text{a} i_\\\\text{a} + \\\\sum_{m\\\\;\\\\in\\\\;\\\\text{lights}} (k_\\\\text{d} (\\\\hat{L}_m \\\\cdot \\\\hat{N}) i_{m,\\\\text{d}} + k_\\\\text{s} (\\\\hat{R}_m \\\\cdot \\\\hat{V})^{\\\\alpha}i_{m,\\\\text{s}}). where the direction vector \\\\hat{R}_m is calculated as the reflection of \\\\hat{L}_m on the surface characterized by the surface normal \\\\hat{N} using :\\\\hat{R}_m = 2(\\\\hat{L}_m\\\\cdot \\\\hat{N})\\\\hat{N} - \\\\hat{L}_m and the hats indicate that the vectors are normalized. The diffuse term is not affected by the viewer direction (\\\\hat{V}). The specular term is large only when the viewer direction (\\\\hat{V}) is aligned with the reflection direction \\\\hat{R}_m. Their alignment is measured by the \\\\alpha power of the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of the angle between the normalized vectors \\\\hat{R}_m and \\\\hat{V} is equal to their dot product. When \\\\alpha is large, in the case of a nearly mirror-like reflection, the specular highlight will be small, because any viewpoint not aligned with the reflection will have a cosine less than one which rapidly approaches zero when raised to a high power. Although the above formulation is the common way of presenting the Phong reflection model, each term should only be included if the term's dot product is positive. (Additionally, the specular term should only be included if the dot product of the diffuse term is positive.) When the color is represented as RGB values, as often is the case in computer graphics, this equation is typically modeled separately for R, G and B intensities, allowing different reflections constants k_\\\\text{a}, k_\\\\text{d} and k_\\\\text{s} for the different color channels. = Computationally more efficient alterations = When implementing the Phong reflection model, there are a number of methods for approximating the model, rather than implementing the exact formulas, which can speed up the calculation; for example, the Blinn‚ÄìPhong reflection model is a modification of the Phong reflection model, which is more efficient if the viewer and the light source are treated to be at infinity. Another approximation that addresses the calculation of the exponentiation in the specular term is the following: Considering that the specular term should be taken into account only if its dot product is positive, it can be approximated as :\\\\max(0, \\\\hat{R}_m \\\\cdot \\\\hat{V})^\\\\alpha = \\\\max(0, 1-\\\\lambda)^{\\\\beta \\\\gamma} = \\\\left(\\\\max(0,1-\\\\lambda)^\\\\beta\\\\right)^\\\\gamma \\\\approx \\\\max(0, 1 - \\\\beta \\\\lambda)^\\\\gamma where \\\\lambda = 1 - \\\\hat{R}_m \\\\cdot \\\\hat{V}, and \\\\beta = \\\\alpha / \\\\gamma\\\\, is a real number which doesn't have to be an integer. If \\\\gamma is chosen to be a power of 2, i.e. \\\\gamma = 2^n where n is an integer, then the expression (1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)^\\\\gamma can be more efficiently calculated by squaring (1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)\\\\ n times, i.e. :(1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)^\\\\gamma \\\\,=\\\\, (1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)^{2^n} \\\\,=\\\\, (1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)^{\\\\overbrace{\\\\scriptstyle 2\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,2\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,\\\\dots\\\\,\\\\cdot\\\\,2}^n} \\\\,=\\\\, (\\\\dots((1 - \\\\beta\\\\lambda)\\\\overbrace{^2)^2\\\\dots)^2}^n. This approximation of the specular term holds for a sufficiently large, integer \\\\gamma (typically, 4 or 8 will be enough). Furthermore, the value \\\\lambda can be approximated as \\\\lambda = (\\\\hat{R}_m - \\\\hat{V})\\\\cdot(\\\\hat{R}_m - \\\\hat{V}) / 2, or as \\\\lambda = (\\\\hat{R}_m \\\\times \\\\hat{V})\\\\cdot(\\\\hat{R}_m \\\\times \\\\hat{V}) / 2. The latter is much less sensitive to normalization errors in \\\\hat{R}_m and \\\\hat{V} than Phong's dot-product-based \\\\lambda = 1 - \\\\hat{R}_m \\\\cdot \\\\hat{V} is, and practically doesn't require \\\\hat{R}_m and \\\\hat{V} to be normalized except for very low-resolved triangle meshes. This method substitutes a few multiplications for a variable exponentiation, and removes the need for an accurate reciprocal-square-root-based vector normalization. Inverse Phong reflection model The Phong reflection model in combination with Phong shading is an approximation of shading of objects in real life. This means that the Phong equation can relate the shading seen in a photograph with the surface normals of the visible object. Inverse refers to the wish to estimate the surface normals given a rendered image, natural or computer-made. The Phong reflection model contains many parameters, such as the surface diffuse reflection parameter (albedo) which may vary within the object. Thus the normals of an object in a photograph can only be determined, by introducing additional information such as the number of lights, light directions and reflection parameters. For example, we have a cylindrical object, for instance a finger, and wish to compute the normal N=[N_x, N_z] on a line on the object. We assume only one light, no specular reflection, and uniform known (approximated) reflection parameters. We can then simplify the Phong equation to: :I_p(x) = C_a + C_d (L(x) \\\\cdot N(x)) With C_a a constant equal to the ambient light and C_d a constant equal to the diffusion reflection. We can re- write the equation to: :( I_p(x)- C_a ) / C_d = L(x) \\\\cdot N(x) Which can be rewritten for a line through the cylindrical object as: :( I_p- C_a ) / C_d = L_x N_x + L_z N_z For instance if the light direction is 45 degrees above the object L=[0.71, 0.71] we get two equations with two unknowns. :( I_p- C_a ) / C_d = 0.71 N_x + 0.71 N_z :1 = \\\\sqrt{(N_x^2 + N_z^2)} Because of the powers of two in the equation there are two possible solutions for the normal direction. Thus some prior information of the geometry is needed to define the correct normal direction. The normals are directly related to angles of inclination of the line on the object surface. Thus the normals allow the calculation of the relative surface heights of the line on the object using a line integral, if we assume a continuous surface. If the object is not cylindrical, we have three unknown normal values N=[N_x, N_y, N_z]. Then the two equations still allow the normal to rotate around the view vector, thus additional constraints are needed from prior geometric information. For instance in face recognition those geometric constraints can be obtained using principal component analysis (PCA) on a database of depth-maps of faces, allowing only surface normals solutions which are found in a normal population.  Applications  The Phong reflection model is often used together with Phong shading to shade surfaces in 3D computer graphics software. Apart from this, it may also be used for other purposes. For example, it has been used to model the reflection of thermal radiation from the Pioneer probes in an attempt to explain the Pioneer anomaly.

The decision in 1898 to clear slum districts in the Holborn area provided an opportunity to use the new streets for a tramway connecting the lines in the north and south. Following the pattern of tramways in New York (the Murray Hill Tunnel) and Boston (the MBTA Green Line), it was decided to build this as an underground connection. History=1902‚Äì1905: Construction= The London County Council had for many years wanted to connect its \\"North Side\\" and \\"South Side\\" tramway networks in order to be able to send \\"North Side\\" trams for overhaul to the Central Repair Depot at Charlton in South East London. In 1902, it decided to build a subway from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south, from where a surface line would continue over the bridge. Legal problems delayed permission to build the subway and tram route and it was not until 1906 that permission to build was granted, and then not to cross the bridge. Because of a sewer at the northern end and the District Railway to the south it was decided to build the subway for single-deck trams only. After leaving the subway at the south end, trams turned right along the Embankment to Westminster Bridge or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the Hop Exchange. This latter service was short-lived and the tracks were removed in 1930. The approach from the north near Southampton Row was a open cutting with a 1 in 10 (10%) gradient. The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the Fleet sewer before rising slightly to enter Holborn tramway station. South from here the subway was built with a steel roof to Aldwych tramway station and, because it was not initially planned to run a public service south of here, the tracks leading towards the Strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits. In the parliamentary session of 1905, plans were submitted for an additional station at the south end of the tunnel, under Wellington Street. The opening of the new tramway along the Embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster Place to enable an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo Bridge and a triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade. =1906: Opening= Services opened to the public on 24 February 1906 from Angel to Aldwych, with a ceremonial opening by the chairman of the Highways Committee. The first journey took 12 minutes northbound and 10 minutes to return, despite horse-drawn vehicles also using the roads on the surface part of the route. On 16 November that year the routes were extended north from The Angel to Highbury station. Special trams were constructed from non-flammable materials ‚Äì wooden trams, common on other routes, were not permitted through the subway.More London Tramway Abandonments Railway Gazette 4 April 1952 page 391 Through services commenced on 10 April 1908 from Highbury station to Tower Bridge and to Kennington Gate, with a procession of six cars going south from the Holborn through to Kennington, then to Elephant & Castle in order to return through the subway to Angel. The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea which, due to a low bridge, could be operated with single-deck vehicles only. Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station. Drivers on routes through the subway had to have at least two years' experience on other services to be considered for these routes. =1929: Double-decker trams= Service patterns continued to change, especially with the opening of tram lines over Blackfriars Bridge on 14 September 1909, and during the 1920s it was realised that to remain profitable the subway needed to be able to take double-deck trams. In 1929 it was decided to increase the headroom to . Work started on 11 September of that year, resulting in the replacement of the cast iron tubes by a new steel girder-supported roof and the diversion of the sewer. In places the trackbed was lowered by , requiring the underpinning of the walls with concrete. After the last services ran on the night of 2 February 1930 the subway was closed until the formal re-opening on 14 January 1931 using E/3 type tram no. 1931 on new route 31, with public services starting the following day. The two tramway stations were also completely rebuilt. Routes were now Hackney to Wandsworth or Tooting, Leyton to Westminster, Highbury to Waterloo station or Norbury and Archway to Kennington. A weekend service between Highgate (Archway) and Downham via Brockley ran until 1932. With a distance of , this was the longest tram route entirely within the County of London. =1935‚Äì1940: Introduction of trolleybuses= 1937 southern portal under Waterloo Bridge The London Passenger Transport Board was formed in 1933, taking over the London County Council trams. It was decided soon after to replace all trams in London by \\"more modern vehicles\\". The abandonment programme began in 1935 with trams in South-West, West, North-West, North and East London mostly being replaced by trolleybuses. The replacement programme proceeded swiftly until 1940, when the last of the pre-war series of conversions occurred, leaving only the South London trams and the subway routes 31, 33 and 35, the only North London tram routes to survive the war. Prototype Kingsway trolleybus no. 1379, with exits on both sides with folding doors, was constructed for feasibility tests through the subway, but these were unsuccessful as trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway, headroom restrictions making it impossible to use overhead current collection. The vehicle was retained and ran in normal service alongside conventional trolleybuses. Waterloo Bridge rebuilding In 1937, the rebuilding of Waterloo Bridge required the diversion of the side entrance to the tramway to a new position centrally underneath the bridge, which opened on 21 November of that year. There were metal doors covering this entrance until 2007, when construction began on the London Buddha Bar, which opened in autumn 2008. Changes leaflet =1946‚Äì1952: Withdrawal of trams= In 1946, it was decided to replace London's remaining trams \\"as soon as possible\\", this time by diesel buses. The first subway route to be withdrawn was route 31, on 1 October 1950, with the remaining two routes, 33 and 35, being withdrawn after service on Saturday, 5 April 1952, the last public services being 'specials' on the Sunday, shortly after midnight. During the early hours of the next morning the remaining trams north of the subway were run through to the depots south of the Thames. =1952‚Äì1957: Closure= Trams were abandoned in London on 5 July 1952, after which street tracks were lifted, but those in the subway mostly remain in place. In 1953, London Transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches in case they were needed for the Coronation but proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a film studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from October 1957. After closure, a number of cartoons appeared in London newspapers based on the closed tramway, with ghostly trams or 'lost' tube trains. On 23 November 1954 an edition of The Goon Show entitled 'The Last Tram' featured a driver and conductress (Henry Crun and Minnie Bannister) who hid in the subway for 2¬Ω years in order to ensure they were London's last tram. =1958 to present: Strand Underpass and other uses= Interior of subway, looking south (April 2004). In June 1958, the London County Council proposed making use of the subway for light traffic from Waterloo Bridge in order to reduce traffic congestion at its junction with Strand and, in April 1962, the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used. Construction began that September and it opened as the Strand Underpass on 21 January 1964. The southern section of the abandoned subway between the Embankment and the Strand Underpass has been converted into a branch of the Buddha Bar chain of bar/restaurants. This involved the demolition of the pedestrian subways under Waterloo Bridge and extensive construction in the bridge's undercroft. Until the opening of the Thames Barrier in 1984, a portable building near the north of the tunnel was used as a flood control headquarters for the Greater London Council. Between 8 October and 8 November 2009, the tunnel hosted a site-specific art installation called Chord by the artist Conrad Shawcross. Although following the same route along Kingsway, it was not envisaged that the proposed Cross River Tram would use the subway. The Cross River Tram project was cancelled in 2008. In 2012, it was announced that Crossrail's tunnel contractor BAM Nuttall/Ferrovial/Kier (BFK) would form a grout shaft beneath the original tunnel of the old central London subway. The purpose of the grout shafts is to stabilize the ground in anticipation of the arrival of tunnel boring equipment in 2013. Crossrail agreed to restore the tunnel to its current condition on completion of the tunnel boring project, and a planning application to do this restoration was submitted in 2017. The Greater London Authority publication Human Streets in March 2016 contained the proposal that the tunnel could be opened for cycling, in order to connect cyclists using the busy Theobalds Road route with the East-West Cycle Superhighway on the Embankment, thereby avoiding four junctions difficult for cyclists.Human Streets, Greater London Authority, March 2016 In popular culture *The remaining northern part of the subway is sometimes used in films, for example as itself in the Stephen Poliakoff film Hidden City, the secret entrance to the base in the film version of The Avengers and a railway tunnel in the film Bhowani Junction. It also appeared in The Escapist. *In an episode of The Goon Show, Neddie Seagoon discovers that a long-lost tram has been hijacked by its driver Henry Crun and is hidden in the Kingsway tunnel.

It is the largest emergency supply in the world, and its underground tanks in Louisiana and Texas have capacity for . The United States started the petroleum reserve in 1975 after oil supplies were interrupted during the 1973‚Äì1974 oil embargo, to mitigate future supply disruptions. The current inventory is displayed on the SPR's website. , the inventory was . This equates to about days of oil at 2013 daily U.S. consumption levels of US Total Petroleum Consumption, US Energy Information Administration. or days of oil at 2013 daily U.S. import levels of .US Total Crude Oil and Products Imports, U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, the maximum total withdrawal capability from the SPR is only , so it would take over days to use the entire inventory. At recent market prices ($17 a barrel as of April 2020),WTI & Brent Crude Oil Prices the SPR holds over $10.8 billion in sweet crude and approximately $18.3 billion in sour crude (assuming a $15/barrel discount for sulfur content). In 2012, the total value of the crude in the SPR was approximately $43.5 billion, while the price paid for the oil was $20.1 billion (an average of $28.42 per barrel).  Facilities  Strategic Petroleum Reserves, United States, 2018. The SPR management office is located in Elmwood, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans. The reserve is stored at four sites on the Gulf of Mexico, each located near a major center of petrochemical refining and processing. Each site contains a number of artificial caverns created in salt domes below the surface. Individual caverns within a site can be up to below the surface, average dimensions are wide and deep, and capacity ranges from . Almost $4 billion was spent on the facilities. The decision to store in caverns was made in order to reduce costs; the Department of Energy claims it is roughly 10 times cheaper to store oil below surface with the added advantages of no leaks and a constant natural churn of the oil due to a temperature gradient in the caverns. The caverns were created by drilling down and then dissolving the salt with water. =Existing= * Bryan Mound: Freeport, Texas. 20 caverns with a storage capacity of with a drawdown capacity of per day.\\"Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan: Expansion to One Billion Barrels\\" (Page 5), US Department of Energy, June 2007. * Big Hill: Winnie, Texas.

This facility was a conventional room and pillar near-surface salt mine, formerly owned by Morton Salt. In 1993, a sinkhole formed on the site, allowing fresh water to intrude into the mine. Because of the mine's construction in salt deposits, fresh water would erode the ceiling, potentially causing the structure to fail. The mine was backfilled with salt- saturated brine. This process, which allowed for recovery of 98% of the petroleum stored in the facility, reduced the risk of further fresh water intrusion, and helped prevent the remaining oil from leaking into the aquifer that is located over the salt dome.  History =Background= Access to the reserve is determined by the conditions written into the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), primarily to counter a severe supply interruption. The maximum removal rate, by physical constraints, is . Oil could begin entering the marketplace 13 days after a presidential order. The Department of Energy says it has about 59 days of import protection in the SPR. This, combined with private sector inventory protection, is estimated to equal 115 days of imports. The SPR was created following the 1973 energy crisis. The EPCA of December 22, 1975, made it policy for the United States to establish a reserve up to 1 billion barrels (159 million m¬≥) of petroleum. A number of existing storage sites were acquired in 1977. Construction of the first surface facilities began in June 1977. On July 21, 1977, the first oil‚Äîapproximately of Saudi Arabian light crude‚Äîwas delivered to the SPR. Fill was suspended in Fiscal Year 1995 to devote budget resources to refurbishing the SPR equipment and extending the life of the complex. The current SPR sites are expected to be usable until around 2025. Fill was resumed in 1999. =Repletion and suspension= On November 13, 2001, shortly after the September 11 terrorist attacks, President George W. Bush announced that the SPR would be filled, saying, \\"The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is an important element of our Nation's energy security. To maximize long-term protection against oil supply disruptions, I am directing the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR up to its capacity.\\" The highest prior level was reached in 1994 with . At the time of President Bush's directive, the SPR contained about . Since the directive in 2001, the capacity of the SPR increased by due to natural enlargement of the salt caverns in which the reserves are stored. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 has since directed the Secretary of Energy to fill the SPR to the full authorized capacity, a process which will require a physical expansion of the Reserve's facilities. On August 17, 2005, the SPR reached its goal of , or about 96% of its now-increased capacity. Approximately 60% of the crude oil in the reserve is the less desirable sour (high sulfur content) variety. The oil delivered to the reserve is \\"royalty-in-kind\\" oil‚Äîroyalties owed to the U.S. government by operators who acquire leases on the federally owned Outer Continental Shelf in the Gulf of Mexico. These royalties were previously collected as cash, but in 1998 the government began testing the effectiveness of collecting royalties \\"in kind\\"‚Äîor in other words, acquiring the crude oil itself. This mechanism was adopted when refilling the SPR began, and once filling is completed, revenues from the sale of future royalties will be paid into the federal treasury. On April 25, 2006, President Bush announced a temporary halt to petroleum deposits to the SPR as part of a four-point program to alleviate high fuel prices. On January 23, 2007, President Bush suggested in his State of the Union speech that Congress should approve expansion of the current reserve capacity to twice its current level. On May 16, 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said it would halt all deliveries to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve sometime in July. This announcement came days after Congress voted to direct the Bush administration to do the same. On January 2, 2009, after a sharp decline in fuel prices, DOE said that it would begin buying approximately of crude oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, replenishing supplies that were sold after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. The purchase would be funded by the roughly $600 million received from those emergency sales. On September 9, 2011, a Notice of Cancellation was published in the Federal Register after Congress rescinded funding for the expansion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, reversing the SPR expansion initiative previously directed under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. On October 20, 2014, a report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommended reducing the size of the Reserve. According to the report, the amount of oil held in reserve exceeds the amount required to be kept on hand given the need for imported crude oil had decreased in recent years. The report said DOE agreed with the GAO recommendation. On March 19, 2020 President Trump directed the Department of Energy to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to maximum capacity. This directive was given to help support domestic oil producers given the impending economic collapse from COVID-19 and extreme drops in international oil markets.https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-energy-executes-direction- president-trump-announces-solicitation-purchase-crude =Emergency sales to Israel= According to the 1975 Sinai Interim Agreement signed by the United States and Israel, as a precondition for Israel's return of the Sinai Peninsula and its associated oil reserves to Egypt, in an emergency the United States was obligated to make oil available for sale to Israel for up to five years. Israel has never invoked the agreement, however. The agreement was extended in 1979, 1994, 2004, and, most recently, in 2015 for a ten-year period. =International obligations= As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United States must stock an amount of petroleum equivalent to at least 90 days of U.S. imports. The SPR contained an equivalent to 141 days of imports as of September 2016. The United States is also obligated to contribute 43.9% of petroleum in any IEA-coordinated release.  Limitations  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is primarily a crude petroleum reserve, not a stockpile of refined petroleum fuels such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene. Although the United States maintains some extra supply of refined petroleum fuels, e.g., the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve and Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve under the aegis of the Department of Energy (DOE), the government does not maintain gasoline reserves on anything like the scale of the SPR. The SPR is intended to give the United States protection from disruptions in oil supplies. In the event of a major disruption to refinery operations, the United States would have to call on members of the International Energy Agency that stockpile refined products, and use refining capacities outside of the continental United States for relief. There have been suggestions that the DOE should increase its supplies and stockpile both gasoline and jet fuel. Some countries and zones have a strategic reserve of both petroleum and petroleum products. In some cases, this includes a strategic reserve of jet fuel. Former Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman said that the Department would consider new facilities for refined products as part of an expansion of .

They aim to reveal the importance of environmental and genetic influences for traits, phenotypes, and disorders. Twin research is considered a key tool in behavioral genetics and in content fields, from biology to psychology. Twin studies are part of the broader methodology used in behavior genetics, which uses all data that are genetically informative ‚Äì siblings studies, adoption studies, pedigree, etc. These studies have been used to track traits ranging from personal behavior to the presentation of severe mental illnesses such as schizophrenia. Twins are a valuable source for observation because they allow the study of environmental influence and varying genetic makeup: \\"identical\\" or monozygotic (MZ) twins share essentially 100% of their genes, which means that most differences between the twins (such as height, susceptibility to boredom, intelligence, depression, etc.) are due to experiences that one twin has but not the other twin.Plomin, R.; DeFries, J. C.; Knopik, V. S.; Neiderhiser, J. M. (Ed.). (2014). Behavioral Genetics (6th ed.). New York, NY: Worth Publishers \\"Fraternal\\" or dizygotic (DZ) twins share only about 50% of their genes, the same as any other sibling. Twins also share many aspects of their environment (e.g., uterine environment, parenting style, education, wealth, culture, community) because they are born into the same family. The presence of a given genetic or phenotypic trait in only one member of a pair of twins (called discordance) provides a powerful window into environmental effects on such a trait. Twins are also useful in showing the importance of the unique environment (specific to one twin or the other) when studying trait presentation. Changes in the unique environment can stem from an event or occurrence that has only affected one twin. This could range from a head injury or a birth defect that one twin has sustained while the other remains healthy. The classical twin design compares the similarity of monozygotic (identical) and dizygotic (fraternal) twins. If identical twins are considerably more similar than fraternal twins (which is found for most traits), this implicates that genes play an important role in these traits. By comparing many hundreds of families with twins, researchers can then understand more about the roles of genetic effects, shared environment, and unique environment in shaping behavior. Modern twin studies have concluded that almost all traits are in part influenced by genetic differences, with some characteristics showing a stronger influence (e.g. height), others an intermediate level (e.g. personality traits) and some more complex heritabilities, with evidence for different genes affecting different aspects of the trait ‚Äì as in the case of autism. The methodological assumptions on which twin studies are based, however, have been criticized as untenable.  History  Francis Galton laid the foundations of behavior genetics as a branch of science. Twins have been of interest to scholars since early civilization, including the early physician Hippocrates (5th century BCE), who attributed different diseases in twins to different material circumstances, and the stoic philosopher Posidonius (1st century BCE), who attributed such similarities to shared astrological circumstances.Cicero, De Divinatione, (On Divination), ii. 42 More recent study is from Sir Francis Galton's pioneering use of twins to study the role of genes and environment on human development and behavior. Galton, however, was unaware of the difference between identical and DZ twins. This factor was still not understood when the first study using psychological tests was conducted by Edward Thorndike (1905) using fifty pairs of twins. This paper was an early statement of the hypothesis that family effects decline with age. His study compared twin pairs age 9‚Äì10 and 13‚Äì14 to normal siblings born within a few years of one another. Thorndike incorrectly reasoned that his data supported for there being one, not two, twin types. This mistake was repeated by Ronald Fisher (1919), who argued An early, and perhaps first, study understanding the distinction is from the German geneticist Hermann Werner Siemens in 1924. Chief among Siemens' innovations was the polysymptomatic similarity diagnosis. This allowed him to account for the oversight that had stumped Fisher, and was a staple in twin research prior to the advent of molecular markers. Wilhelm Weinberg and colleagues in 1910 used the identical-DZ distinction to calculate respective rates from the ratios of same- and opposite-sex twins in a maternity population. They partitioned co-variation amongst relatives into genetic and environmental elements, anticipating the later work of Fisher and Wright, including the effect of dominance on similarity of relatives, and beginning the first classic-twin studies. A study conducted by Darrick Antell and Eva Taczanowski found that \\"twins showing the greatest discrepancies in visible aging signs also had the greatest degree of discordance between personal lifestyle choices and habits\\", and concluded that \\"the genetic influences on aging may be highly overrated, with lifestyle choices exerting far more important effects on physical aging.\\" Examples Examples of prominent twin studies include the following: *Maudsley Bipolar Twin Study *Minnesota Twin Family Study *Twins Early Development Study  Methods  The power of twin designs arises from the fact that twins may be either monozygotic (identical (MZ): developing from a single fertilized egg and therefore sharing all of their alleles) ‚Äì or dizygotic (DZ: developing from two fertilized eggs and therefore sharing on average 50% of their polymorphic alleles, the same level of genetic similarity as found in non-twin siblings). These known differences in genetic similarity, together with a testable assumption of equal environments for identical and fraternal twins creates the basis for the twin design for exploring the effects of genetic and environmental variance on a phenotype. The basic logic of the twin study can be understood with very little mathematics beyond an understanding of the concepts of variance and thence derived correlation. = Classical twin method = Like all behavior genetic research, the classical twin study begins from assessing the variance of a behavior (called a phenotype by geneticists) in a large group, and attempts to estimate how much of this is due to: * genetic effects (heritability); * shared environment ‚Äì events that happen to both twins, affecting them in the same way; * unshared, or unique, or nonshared environment ‚Äì events that occur to one twin but not the other, or events that affect either twin in a different way. Typically these three components are called A (additive genetics) C (common environment) and E (unique environment); hence the acronym ACE. It is also possible to examine non-additive genetics effects (often denoted D for dominance (ADE model); see below for more complex twin designs). The ACE model indicates what proportion of variance in a trait is heritable, versus the proportion due to shared environment or un-shared environment. Research is carried out using SEM programs such as OpenMx, however the core logic of the twin design is the same, as described below: Monozygotic (identical ‚Äì MZ) twins raised in a family share both 100% of their genes, and all of the shared environment. Any differences arising between them in these circumstances are random (unique). The correlation between identical twins provides an estimate of A + C. Dizygotic (DZ) twins also share C, but share on average 50% of their genes: so the correlation between fraternal twins is a direct estimate of ¬ΩA+C. If r is correlation, then rmz and rdz are simply the correlations of the trait in identical and fraternal twins respectively. For any particular trait, then: :rmz = A + C :rdz = ¬ΩA + C A, therefore, is twice the difference between identical and fraternal twin correlations : the additive genetic effect (Falconer's formula). C is simply the MZ correlation minus this estimate of A. The random (unique) factor E is 1 ‚àí rmz: i.e., MZ twins differ due to unique environments only. (Jinks & Fulker, 1970; Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, & McGuffin, 2001). Stated again, the difference between these two sums, then, allows us to solve for A, C, and E. As the difference between the identical and fraternal correlations is due entirely to a halving of the genetic similarity, the additive genetic effect 'A' is simply twice the difference between the identical and fraternal correlations: :A = 2 (rmz ‚àí rdz) As the identical correlation reflects the full effect of A and C, E can be estimated by subtracting this correlation from 1 :E = 1 ‚àí rmz Finally, C can be derived: :C = rmz ‚àí A = Modern modeling = Beginning in the 1970s, research transitioned to modeling genetic, environmental effects using maximum likelihood methods (Martin & Eaves, 1977). While computationally much more complex, this approach has numerous benefits rendering it almost universal in current research. An example structural model (for the heritability of height among Danish males) is shown: {  A: ACE model showing raw (non-standardised) variance coefficients  B: ACE model showing standardised variance coefficients } Model A on the left shows the raw variance in height. This is useful as it preserves the absolute effects of genes and environments, and expresses these in natural units, such as mm of height change. Sometimes it is helpful to standardize the parameters, so each is expressed as percentage of total variance. Because we have decomposed variance into A, C, and E, the total variance is simply A + C + E. We can then scale each of the single parameters as a proportion of this total, i.e., Standardised‚ÄìA = A/(A + C + E). Heritability is the standardised genetic effect.  Model comparison  A principal benefit of modeling is the ability to explicitly compare models: Rather than simply returning a value for each component, the modeler can compute confidence intervals on parameters, but, crucially, can drop and add paths and test the effect via statistics such as the AIC. Thus, for instance to test for predicted effects of family or shared environment on behavior, an AE model can be objectively compared to a full ACE model. For example, we can ask of the figure above for height: Can C (shared environment) be dropped without significant loss of fit? Alternatively, confidence intervals can be calculated for each path.  Multi-group and multivariate modeling  Multivariate modeling can give answers to questions about the genetic relationship between variables that appear independent. For instance: do IQ and long-term memory share genes? Do they share environmental causes? Additional benefits include the ability to deal with interval, threshold, and continuous data, retaining full information from data with missing values, integrating the latent modeling with measured variables, be they measured environments, or, now, measured molecular genetic markers such as SNPs. In addition, models avoid constraint problems in the crude correlation method: all parameters will lie, as they should, between 0‚Äì1 (standardized). Multivariate, and multiple-time wave studies, with measured environment and repeated measures of potentially causal behaviours are now the norm. Examples of these models include extended twin designs, simplex models, and growth- curve models. SEM programs such as OpenMx and other applications suited to constraints and multiple groups have made the new techniques accessible to reasonably skilled users.  Modeling the environment: MZ discordant designs  As MZ twins share both their genes and their family-level environmental factors, any differences between MZ twins reflect E: the unique environment. Researchers can use this information to understand the environment in powerful ways, allowing epidemiological tests of causality that are otherwise typically confounded by factors such as gene-environment covariance, reverse causation and confounding. An example of a positive MZ discordant effect is shown below on the left. The twin who scores higher on trait 1 also scores higher on trait 2. This is compatible with a \\"dose\\" of trait 1 causing an increase in trait 2. Of course, trait 2 might also be affecting trait 1. Disentangling these two possibilities requires a different design (see below for an example). A null result is incompatible with a causal hypothesis. {  A depiction of MZ- discordance data  MZ discordant test of hypothesis that exercise protects against depression } Take for instance the case of an observed link between depression and exercise (See Figure above on right). People who are depressed also reporting doing little physical activity. One might hypothesise that this is a causal link: that \\"dosing\\" patients with exercise would raise their mood and protect against depression. The next figure shows what empirical tests of this hypothesis have found: a null result. Longitudinal discordance designs A cross-lagged longitudinal MZ discordant twin design. This model can take account of relationships among differences across traits at time one, and then examine the distinct hypotheses that increments in trait1 drive subsequent change in that trait in the future, or, importantly, in other traits. As may be seen in the next Figure, this design can be extended to multiple measurements, with consequent increase in the kinds of information that one can learn. This is called a cross-lagged model (multiple traits measured over more than one time). In the longitudinal discordance model, differences between identical twins can be used to take account of relationships among differences across traits at time one (path A), and then examine the distinct hypotheses that increments in trait1 drive subsequent change in that trait in the future (paths B and E), or, importantly, in other traits (paths C & D). In the example, the hypothesis that the observed correlation where depressed persons often also exercise less than average is causal, can be tested. If exercise is protective against depression, then path D should be significant, with a twin who exercises more showing less depression as a consequence. = Assumptions = It can be seen from the modeling above, the main assumption of the twin study is that of equal environments, also known as the equal environments assumption. This assumption has been directly tested. A special case occurs where parents believe their twins to be non-identical when in fact they are genetically identical. Studies of a range of psychological traits indicate that these children remain as concordant as MZ twins raised by parents who treated them as identical. Molecular genetic methods of heritability estimation have tended to produce lower estimates than classical twin studies, providing evidence that the equal environments assumption of the classic twin design may not be sound. A 2016 study determined that the assumption that the prenatal environment of twins was equal was largely tenable.. Researchers continue to debate whether or not the equal environment assumption is valid.Fosse, Roar, Jay Joseph, and Ken Richardson. \\"A critical assessment of the equal-environment assumption of the twin method for schizophrenia.\\" Frontiers in psychiatry 6 (2015): 62.Joseph, Jay. The trouble with twin studies: A reassessment of twin research in the social and behavioral sciences. Routledge, 2014.  Measured similarity: A direct test of assumptions in twin designs  A particularly powerful technique for testing the twin method was reported by Visscher et al. Instead of using twins, this group took advantage of the fact that while siblings on average share 50% of their genes, the actual gene-sharing for individual sibling pairs varies around this value, essentially creating a continuum of genetic similarity or \\"twinness\\" within families. Estimates of heritability based on direct estimates of gene sharing confirm those from the twin method, providing support for the assumptions of the method. = Sex differences = Genetic factors may differ between the sexes, both in gene expression and in the range of gene √ó environment interactions. Fraternal opposite sex twin pairs are invaluable in explicating these effects. In an extreme case, a gene may only be expressed in one sex (qualitative sex limitation). More commonly, the effects of gene-alleles may depend on the sex of the individual. A gene might cause a change of 100 g in weight in males, but perhaps 150 g in females ‚Äì a quantitative gene effect. Such effects are Environments may impact on the ability of genes to express themselves and may do this via sex differences. For instance genes affecting voting behavior would have no effect in females if females are excluded from the vote. More generally, the logic of sex- difference testing can extend to any defined sub-group of individuals. In cases such as these, the correlation for same and opposite sex DZ twins will differ, betraying the effect of the sex difference. For this reason, it is normal to distinguish three types of fraternal twins. A standard analytic workflow would involve testing for sex-limitation by fitting models to five groups, identical male, identical female, fraternal male, fraternal female, and fraternal opposite sex. Twin modeling thus goes beyond correlation to test causal models involving potential causal variables, such as sex. = Gene √ó environment interactions = Gene effects may often be dependent on the environment. Such interactions are known as G√óE interactions, in which the effects of a gene allele differ across different environments. Simple examples would include situations where a gene multiplies the effect of an environment: perhaps adding 1 inch to height in high nutrient environments, but only half an inch to height in low-nutrient environments. This is seen in different slopes of response to an environment for different genotypes. Often researchers are interested in changes in heritability under different conditions: In environments where alleles can drive large phenotypic effects (as above), the relative role of genes will increase, corresponding to higher heritability in these environments. A second effect is G √ó E correlation, in which certain alleles tend to accompany certain environments. If a gene causes a parent to enjoy reading, then children inheriting this allele are likely to be raised in households with books due to GE correlation: one or both of their parents has the allele and therefore will accumulate a book collection and pass on the book-reading allele. Such effects can be tested by measuring the purported environmental correlate (in this case books in the home) directly. Often the role of environment seems maximal very early in life, and decreases rapidly after compulsory education begins. This is observed for instance in reading as well as intelligence. This is an example of a G*Age effect and allows an examination of both GE correlations due to parental environments (these are broken up with time), and of G*E correlations caused by individuals actively seeking certain environments. revisited in:  Norms of reaction  Studies in plants or in animal breeding allow the effects of experimentally randomized genotypes and environment combinations to be measured. By contrast, human studies are typically observational. This may suggest that norms of reaction cannot be evaluated. As in other fields such as economics and epidemiology, several designs have been developed to capitalise on the ability to use differential gene-sharing, repeated exposures, and measured exposure to environments (such as children social status, chaos in the family, availability and quality of education, nutrition, toxins etc.) to combat this confounding of causes. An inherent appeal of the classic twin design is that it begins to untangle these confounds. For example, in identical and fraternal twins shared environment and genetic effects are not confounded, as they are in non-twin familial studies. Twin studies are thus in part motivated by an attempt to take advantage of the random assortment of genes between members of a family to help understand these correlations. While the twin study tells us only how genes and families affect behavior within the observed range of environments, and with the caveat that often genes and environments will covary, this is a considerable advance over the alternative, which is no knowledge of the different roles of genes and environment whatsoever.M. C. Neale and H. H. Maes. (1996). Methodology for genetics studies of twins and families. Journal. Twin studies are therefore often used as a method of controlling at least one part of this observed variance: Partitioning, for instance, what might previously have been assumed to be family environment into shared environment and additive genetics using the experiment of fully and partly shared genomes in twins. No single design can address all issues. Additional information is available outside the classic twin design. Adoption designs are a form of natural experiment that tests norms of reaction by placing the same genotype in different environments. Association studies, e.g., allow direct study of allelic effects. Mendelian randomization of alleles also provides opportunities to study the effects of alleles at random with respect to their associated environments and other genes.e.g. = Extended twin designs and more complex genetic models = The basic or classical twin-design contains only identical and fraternal twins raised in their biological family. This represents only a sub-set of the possible genetic and environmental relationships. It is fair to say, therefore, that the heritability estimates from twin designs represent a first step in understanding the genetics of behavior. The variance partitioning of the twin study into additive genetic, shared, and unshared environment is a first approximation to a complete analysis taking into account gene-environment covariance and interaction, as well as other non-additive effects on behavior. The revolution in molecular genetics has provided more effective tools for describing the genome, and many researchers are pursuing molecular genetics in order to directly assess the influence of alleles and environments on traits. An initial limitation of the twin design is that it does not afford an opportunity to consider both Shared Environment and Non-additive genetic effects simultaneously. This limit can be addressed by including additional siblings to the design. A second limitation is that gene-environment correlation is not detectable as a distinct effect. Addressing this limit requires incorporating adoption models, or children-of- twins designs, to assess family influences uncorrelated with shared genetic effects.  Continuous variables and ordinal variables  While concordance studies compare traits either present or absent in each twin, correlational studies compare the agreement in continuously varying traits across twins.  Criticism  The twin method has been subject to criticism from statistical genetics, statistics, and psychology, with some researchers, such as Burt & Simons (2014), arguing that conclusions reached via this method are ambiguous or meaningless. Core elements of these criticisms and their rejoinders are listed below. = Criticisms of fundamental assumptions = Critics of twin studies argue that they are based on false or questionable assumptions, including that monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes and the equal environments assumption. On this basis, critics contend that twin studies tend to generate inflated estimates of heritability due to biological confounding factors and consistent underestimation of environmental variance. Other critics take a more moderate stance, arguing that the equal environments assumption is typically inaccurate, but that this inaccuracy tends to have only a modest effect on heritability estimates. = Criticisms of statistical methods = It has been argued that the statistical underpinnings of twin research are invalid. Such statistical critiques argue that heritability estimates used for most twin studies rest on restrictive assumptions that are usually not tested, and if they are, they are often contradicted by the data. For example, Peter Schonemann has criticized methods for estimating heritability developed in the 1970s. He has also argued that the heritability estimate from a twin study may reflect factors other than shared genes. Using the statistical models published in Loehlin and Nichols (1976), the narrow HR- heritability of responses to the question ‚Äúdid you have your back rubbed‚Äù has been shown to work out to .92 heritable for males and .21 heritable for females, and the question ‚ÄúDid you wear sunglasses after dark?‚Äù is 130% heritable for males and 103% for females Critics also contend that the concept of \\"heritability\\" estimated in twin studies is merely a statistical abstraction with no relationship to an underlying entity in DNA.  Responses to statistical critiques  Before computers, statisticians used methods that were computationally tractable, at the cost of known limitations. Since the 1980s these approximate statistical methods have been discarded: Modern twin methods based on structural equation modeling are not subject to the limitations and heritability estimates such as those noted above are mathematically impossible.M. C. Neale, S. M. Boker, G. Xie and H. H. Maes. (2002). Mx: Statistical Modelling. Journal. Critically, the newer methods allow for explicit testing of the role of different pathways and incorporation and testing of complex effects. = Sampling: Twins as representative members of the population = Results of twin studies cannot be automatically generalized beyond the population they come from. It is therefore important to understand the particular sample studied, and the nature of twins themselves. Twins are not a random sample of the population, and they differ in their developmental environment. In this sense they are not representative. For example: Dizygotic (DZ) twin births are affected by many factors. Some women frequently produce more than one egg at each menstrual period and, therefore, are more likely to have twins. This tendency may run in the family either in the mother's or father's side of the family, and often runs through both. Women over the age of 35 are more likely to produce two eggs. Women who have three or more children are also likely to have dizygotic twins. Artificial induction of ovulation and in vitro fertilization-embryo replacement can also give rise to fraternal and identical twins.  Response to representativeness of twins  Twins differ very little from non-twin siblings. Measured studies on the personality and intelligence of twins suggest that they have scores on these traits very similar to those of non- twins (for instance Deary et al. 2006). = Separated twin pairs as representative of other twins = Separated twin pairs, identical or fraternal, are generally separated by adoption. This makes their families of origin non-representative of typical twin families in that they give up their children for adoption. The families they are adopted to are also non- representative of typical twin families in that they are all approved for adoption by children's protection authorities and that a disproportionally large fraction of them have no biological children. Those who volunteer to studies are not even representative of separated twins in general since not all separated twins agree to be part of twin studies.Fatal Flaws in the Twin Study Paradigm: A Reply to Hatemi and Verhulst, Doron Shultziner 2013Twin Studies of Political Behavior: Untenable Assumptions?, Jon Beckwith and Corey A. Morris 2008 = Detection problems = There can be some issues of undetected behaviors in the case of behaviors that many people keep secret presently or in their earlier lives. They may not be as willing to reveal behaviors that are discriminated against or stigmatized. If environment played no role in the actual behavior, skewed detection would still make it look like it played a role. For environment to appear to have no role in such cases, there would have to be either a counterproductivity of intolerance in the sense of intolerance causing the behavior it is bigoted against, or a flaw in the study that makes the results scientifically useless. Even if environment does play a role, the numbers would still be skewed.Critical Analysis: A Comparison of Critical Thinking Changes in Psychology and Philosophy Classes, Teaching of Psychology 2014 41: 28Association for Psychological Science: Why Science Is Not Necessarily Self-Correcting, John P. A. Ioannidis 2012How Black African and White British Women Perceive Depression and Help-Seeking: a Pilot Vignette Study, International Journal of Social Psychiatry March 2010  Terminology = Pairwise concordance = For a group of twins, pairwise concordance is defined as C/(C+D), where C is the number of concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs. For example, a group of 10 twins have been pre-selected to have one affected member (of the pair). During the course of the study four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a pairwise concordance of 4/(4+6) or 4/10 or 40%. = Probandwise concordance = For a group of twins in which at least one member of each pair is affected, probandwise concordance is a measure of the proportion of twins who have the illness who have an affected twin and can be calculated with the formula of 2C/(2C+D), in which C is the number of concordant pairs and D is the number of discordant pairs. For example, consider a group of 10 twins that have been pre-selected to have one affected member. During the course of the study, four other previously non-affected members become affected, giving a probandwise concordance of 8/(8+6) or 8/14 or 57%.

Released in August 1995, four months before the more famous Cyrix 6x86, the Cyrix 5x86 was one of the fastest CPUs ever produced for Socket 3 computer systems. With better performance in most applications than an Intel Pentium processor at 75 MHz, the Cyrix Cx5x86 filled a gap by providing a medium-performance processor option for 486 Socket 3 motherboards (which are incapable of handling Intel's Pentium CPUs, apart from the Pentium Overdrive). Design The Cyrix 5x86 processor, codename \\"M1sc\\", was based on a scaled-down version of the \\"M1\\" core used in the Cyrix 6x86, which provided 80% of the performance for a 50% decrease in transistors over the 6x86 design. It had the 32-bit memory bus of an ordinary 486 processor, but internally had much more in common with fifth- generation processors such as the Cyrix 6x86, the AMD K5, and the Intel Pentium, and even the sixth-generation Intel Pentium Pro. The chip featured near-complete support for i486 instructions, but very limited support for Pentium instructions. Some performance-enhancing features of the CPU were intentionally disabled due to potentially stability-threatening bugs which were not fixed before release time (these features can be enabled with freely downloadable software utilities; see below). The similarly named SGS-Thomson ST5x86 and IBM IBM5x86C were licensed rebrandings of the Cyrix design (IBM and ST physically produced Cyrix's CPUs for them), marketed separately but identical for practical purposes, apart from the availability of a 75 MHz edition which Cyrix did not bring to market, and slight differences in voltage requirements. The Cyrix 5x86 design, however, should not be confused with the similarly named AMD Am5x86 which was essentially a fast 486 (not an all-new design like the Cyrix part) but which had broadly similar performance, used the same Socket 3, and was introduced at the end of the same year. Cyrix's 5x86 was a very short-lived chip, having a market life of only six months. It is likely Cyrix could have continued to successfully sell processors based on Socket 3, but canned the 5x86 so that it would not compete with its then new 6x86 offerings. STMicroelectronics ST5x86-100. The IBM 5x86 with blue heatsink. Controversies and anomalies The official Cyrix 5x86 website boasted about several features of the chip that were disabled by default in the final versions. The most controversial of these features was the \\"branch- prediction\\" feature, which was enabled in the benchmarks results on the company website when comparing the chip to Intel's Pentium processor. While it was possible to enable the extra features using a special software utility, it usually resulted in an unstable system, especially on earlier steppings of the chip when running 32-bit code. There are also many rumours surrounding a 133 MHz, clock-quadrupled version of the Cyrix 5x86. The 133 MHz version is very rare, however, and producers of upgrade kits were given preferential access to it, notably Gainbery. Some of the 100 and 120 MHz parts also contain support for the 4X multiplier setting, and some of these chips may also work at 133 MHz. However, the 5x86 is not known to overclock well; 120 MHz is generally considered to be pushing the limitations of the process on which it was fabricated. An 80 MHz (2x40MHz) 5x86 also exists, but is unclear as to whether or not it was ever officially released. IBM's 5x86C was considered to be more conservatively rated than the Cyrix branded parts, and operated at a lower voltage (3.3V). For example: what Cyrix would rate as a 100 MHz part, IBM would mark as 75 MHz. IBM 5x86C was available as 75MHz and 100MHz parts. A few examples of 120MHz parts also exist, but they have early production dates indicating that they may have been produced prior to IBM's decision to scale back clock speeds. 5x86C also had a much longer production run than the Cyrix branded parts.

The Culture of Albania (; ) is a term that embodies the artistic, culinary, literary, musical, political and social elements that are representative of Albania and Albanians. Albanian culture has been considerably shaped by the geography and history of Albania. It grew from that of the Illyrians, with their pagan beliefs and specific way of life in the wooded areas of far Southern Europe. Albanian culture has also been influenced by the Ancient Greeks, Romans, Byzantines and Ottomans. Albanians can be culturally and linguistically separated into two groups such as the northern Ghegs and southern Tosks. The line of demarcation between both groups, based on dialect, is the Shkumbin River that crosses Albania from east to west. Outside of Albania, Gheg is mostly spoken by the Albanians of Kosovo, northwestern North Macedonia, Montenegro and Croatia (Arbanasi). On the other hand, Tosk is spoken by the Albanians of Greece (Arvanites, Chams), southwestern North Macedonia and southern Italy (Arb√´resh√´). The diversity between Ghegs and Tosks can be substantial, both sides identify strongly with the common national and ethnic culture. Albania is the name of the country attested in Medieval Latin. The name has derived from the Illyrian tribe of the Albanoi and their capital in Albanopolis that was noted by Ptolemy in ancient times.Lloshi 1999, p. 277. \\"The Albanians of today call themselves shqiptar√´, their country Shqip√´ri, and their language shqipe. These terms came into use between the end of the 17th and beginning of the 18th centuries. Foreigners call them albanesi (Italian), Albaner (German), Albanians (English), Alvanos (Greek), and Arbanasi (old Serbian), the country Albania, Albanie, Albanien, Alvania, and Albanija, and the language Albanese, Albanisch, Albanian, Alvaniki, and Arbanashki respectively. All these words are derived from the name Albanoi of an Illyrian tribe and their center Albanopolis, noted by the astronomer of Alexandria, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Alban could he a plural of alb- arb-, denoting the inhabitants of the plains.Malcolm 1998, p. 29. \\"Nor is there any mystery about the origin of this name. In the second century Ptolemy referred to a tribe called the 'Albanoi', and located their town, 'Albanopolis', somewhere to the east of Durres.\\"M√´niku & Campos 2012, p. 2. \\"Albanian is an Indo- European language, but like modern Greek and Armenian, it does not have any other closely related living language. Within the Indo-European family, it forms a group of its own. In Albanian, the language is called shqip. Albania is called Shqip√´ri, and the Albanians call themselves shqiptar√´. Until the fifteenth century the language was known as Arb√´risht or Arbnisht, which is still the name used for the language in Italy and Greece. The Greeks refer to all the varieties of Albanian spoken in Greece as Arvanitika. In the second century AD, Ptolemy, the Alexandrian mathematician, astronomer and geographer, used the name Albanoi to refer to an Illyrian tribe that used to live in what is now central Albania. During the Middle Ages the population of that area was referred to as Arbanori or Albanon. It is clear that the words Arb√´resh, Arvanitika, and even Albanian and Albania are all related to the older name of the language.\\"Ramadan Marmullaku - 1975, Albania and the Albanians - Page 5 Previously, Albanians called their country Arb√´ri or Arb√´ni and referred to themselves as Arb√´resh√´ or Arb√´nesh√´ until the sixteenth century as the toponym Shqip√´ria or Shqypnia and the endonym Shqiptar√´ or Shqyptar√´ gradually replaced Arb√´ria and Arb√´resh.Pinocacozza.it Kristo Frasheri. History of Albania (A Brief Overview). Tirana, 1964. The terms Shqip√´ria and Shqiptar√´ are popularly interpreted respectively as the \\"Land of Eagles\\" and \\"Children of Eagles\\" / \\"Eagle-Men\\". The double-headed eagle is the national and ethnic symbol of all Albanian-speaking people. The symbol appears in a stone carving dating from the tenth century as the Principality of Arbanon was established. It was also used as a heraldic symbol by a numerous noble families in Albania at that time. The double-headed eagle appears as a symbol for bravery, valor, freedom and heroism. Home of Muslims, Christians and Jews, religious tolerance is one of the most important values of the tradition of the Albanian people. It is widely accepted, that Albanians are well known about those values, about a peaceful coexistence among the believers of different religious communities in the country. Thanks to its long history, Albania is home to many valuable monuments such as among others the remains of Butrint, the medieval cities of Berat and Gjirokast√´r, the Roman amphitheatre of Durr√´s, the Illyrian Tombs and Fortress of Bashtov√´. Other examples of important contributions to architecture may be found in Apollonia, Byllis, Amantia, Phoenice, Shkod√´r and many others.570 Despite being a small country, Albania has as three sites on the UNESCO World Heritage Site List and one Intangible Cultural Heritage element. The Codices of Berat are eminently important for the global community and as well the development of ancient biblical, liturgical and hagiographical literature. Therefore, it was inscribed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005.  Lifestyle = Kanun = Ghegs in the north of Albania. The Kanun, a comprehensive compilation of Albanian traditional customs and cultural practices, was codified by Lek√´ Dukagjini in the Middle Ages. Scholars have conjectured that the Kanun might have derived from Illyrian tribal laws, while others have suggested that it has retained elements from Indo-European Prehistoric eras.Dukagjini, L., Gjecov, S., Fox, L. Kanuni i Lek√´ Dukagjinit. Gjonlekaj Publishing Co., 1989. p. xvi. The Kanun reflects notably the historic development of Albanians through its turbulent history and encompasses in a real statute regulating various aspects of life including customs, traditions and wisdom in Albania. Besa, \\"to keep the promise\\", is the Albanian code of honor and a major component of Albanian culture. It is among the highest and most important concept of the Kanun with a moral and ethic connotation. The term contains the given word or keeping of a promise or obligation and the guaranteed agreement among honorable men. Most notably, Besa means taking care of those in need and being hospitable to every single person. Albania saved and protected almost 2000 Jewish people during the Holocaust. Rather than hiding the Jews in attics or the woods, the Albanians gave them clothes, gave them Albanian names and treated them as part of the family. = Fis (clan) = The traditional Albanian social structure is based on clans () characterized by a common culture, often common ancestry and shared social ties. In past times most of them defended their territory and interests against other clans and external forces. The Albanian tribal society clearly crystallized in the mountains of northern Albania and adjacent areas of Montenegro, and it was also present in a less developed system in southern Albania. One of the most particular elements of the Albanian tribal structure is its dependence on the Kanun of Lek√´ Dukagjini. This social structure was inherited from the ancient Illyrians, thrived until the early years of the 20th century, and remained largely intact until the rise to power of communist regime in 1944. = Oda = A typical Oda Oda is a typical large room in an Albanian traditional house used by the host to receive and entertain the guests... Traditionally, the host and the guests in the oda are old men and marriend men. Till the end of the 20th century, woman and young boys were not allowed to enter the room. In the oda, the men talk, take political discussions and sing epic songs until late hours. During an oda \\"session\\", historical events and traditions are transmitted orally through discussions and songs.. = Holidays = Independence Day in Pristina, Kosovo. In consideration to the long and eventful history of Albania, there are several cultural and religious holidays throughout the country. Albanians, either in Albania, Kosovo and other countries, celebrate their Independence and Flag Day on November 28. Various ceremonies, festivals and concerts take place to celebrate the historic day in major cities amongst them in Tirana and Pristina, holding festive and military parades. Christmas is celebrated by those following the religion of Christianity. Bajram is considered by Muslims as the holiday of forgiveness, moral victory and peace, fellowship and unity. They sacrifice a sheep for this holiday, giving the meat to their family, friends and to the poor people. Another pagan holiday is Dita e Ver√´s, particularly popular in Elbasan and Gjirokast√´r. It is celebrated on March 14 and is intended to commemorate the end of winter, the rebirth of nature and a rejuvenation of spirit amongst the Albanians. The ritual of the day begins on the previous day with the preparation of sweets such as ballokume cooked in a wood oven. During the evening ballokume, dried figs, walnuts, turkey legs, boiled eggs and simite are distributed to members of the family. Dita e M√´suesit is celebrated on March 7 since 1887 and is regarded by many Albanians as one of the most important holidays of the country. It honors the opening of the first school that taught lessons in Albanian language in Kor√ß√´. = Cuisine = Olive oil was used since ancient times in Albanian cooking. The Albanian cuisine, a representative of the Mediterranean cuisine, has developed through the centuries of social and economic changes and more importantly referable to different factors that stands in close interaction with each other such as the small and mountainous territory of the country with virgin forests, narrow valleys, vast plains and a favourable climate that offers excellent growth conditions for a variety of vegetables, herbs and fruits. Food is for Albanians an important component of their culture and is deeply rooted in the history, traditions and values of the country. The cooking traditions of the Albanian people are diverse and nevertheless olive oil is the most commonly used vegetable fat in Albanian cooking, which has been produced since antiquity throughout the country particularly along the coasts. Albanian cuisine uses a variety of ingredients which include a wider availability of vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, potatoes, cabbages and spinach, as well as cereals such as wheat, sweetcorn, barley and rye. Herbs and spices include oregano, mint, garlic, onion and basil. Widely used meat varieties are lamb, goat, beef, veal, chicken and other poultry and pork. Considering the direct proximity to the sea, seafood specialities are particularly popular along the Albanian Adriatic and Ionian Sea Coasts. Hospitality is a fundamental custom of Albanian society and serving food is an integral to the hosting of guests and visitors. It is not infrequent for visitors to be invited to eat and drink with locals. The medieval Albanian code of honour, called Besa, resulted to look after guests and strangers as an act of recognition and gratitude. = Religion = Mother Teresa was an Albanian Roman Catholic nun and missionary. Christianity, Islam and Judaism are the traditional religions of Albania. The constitution extends freedom of religion to all citizens and the government generally respects this right in practice. Albania have always been considered as a unique country in terms of religion and religious tolerance is one of the main characteristics of Albanians. Christianity has a long and eventful history in the country whereby it belongs to one of the most ancient countries of Christianity. There are thought to have been about seventy Christian families in Durr√´s as early as the time of the Apostles. Paul the Apostle was the founder of the Archbishopric of Durr√´s while he was preaching in Illyria and Epirus. In the eleventh century, Albanians first appeared in Byzantine sources and at this point, they were already fully Christianized. The first known bishop of Albania was the Bishop of Scutari founded in 387 in Shkod√´r. In the late seventeenth century, Pope Clement XI served as the Pope from 1700 to 1721. He was born to an Albanian father descended from the noble Albani family from the region of Mal√´si e Madhe in Albania. Pope Clement XI, the first pope of Albanian heritage. The history of Judaism in the country can be traced back to the classical era. Jewish migration from the Roman Empire is considered the most likely source of the first Jews on the country's territory. It may have first arrived in Albania in the first century BC. They build the first synagogue in Sarand√´ in the early fifth century. In the sixteenth century, there were Jewish settlements in most of major cities such as Berat, Elbasan, Vlor√´, Durr√´s and as well as in Kosovo region. Albania was the only country during the Holocaust in Europe where Jewish population experienced growth.Samer, Haroey (1997), \\"Rescue in Albania: One Hundred Percent of Jews in Albania Rescued from Holocaust\\", The Jews of Albania, California: Brunswick Press, archived from the original on 2008-05-10, retrieved 21 October 2012 After the mass emigration to Israel following the fall of communist regime, only 200 Albanian Jews are left in the country today. In 2010, a new synagogue \\"Hechal Shlomo\\" started providing services for the Jewish community in Tirana. Islam arrived for the first time in the ninth century to the region, when Muslim Arabs raided the eastern Adriatic Sea. In the fifteenth century, Islam emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After declaration of independence on November 28, 1912, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later the communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom.  Arts = Painting = Epitaph of Gllavenica, the highlight of medieval Albanian art that was commissioned by Gjergj Arianiti in 1373. The art of Albania has a long and memorable history, represented in many forms such as painting, sculpture, mosaic and architecture. It show a great variety in style, in different regions and periods. Nonetheless, the country also has a tolerable heritage in visual arts, specifically in frescoes, murals and icons, which often can be seen in many of the older structures in the country. The surviving monuments of Illyrian, Ancient Greek and Roman art are notable for a tradition concentrating on the human figure and decorations. Through the many archaeological discoveries, in different areas of Albania have been found numerous of pottery, terracotta and metalworking belonging to the Illyrians and several sculptures and mosaics belonging to the Ancient Greeks and Romans. Albanian medieval art started with the Byzantine Empire that ruled the great majority of Albania and the Balkan Peninsula. The first paintings have been icons and frescoes with an admirable use of colour and gold. The most famous representative of Albanian medieval art were Onufri who was distinguished for its rich use of colours and decorative shades with certain ethnographic national elements that are more visible with his successors David Selenica, Kostandin Shpataraku and the Zografi Brothers. Illuminated manuscripts were another significant feature of Albanian medieval art. The Codices of Berat are two ancient Gospels from Berat that dates from the sixth and ninth centuries. They represent one of the most valuable treasures of the Albanian cultural heritage that was inscribed on the UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2005. Motra Tone created by Kol√´ Idromeno. In the fifteenth century, during the Ottoman invasion many Albanians migrated out of the area to escape either various socio-political and economic difficulties. Among them, the medieval painters Marco Basaiti and Viktor Karpa√ßi, sculptor and architect Andrea Nikoll√´ Aleksi and art collector Alessandro Albani from the Albani family. The Ottoman Empire ruled over the country and most of the Balkans for nearly five centuries. This influence were absorbed and reinterpreted with an extensive construction of mosques that opened a new section in Albanian art, that of Islamic art. In the nineteenth century a significant era for Albanian art begins. The great liberation acts starting with League of Prizren in 1878, that led to the Independence in 1912, established the climate for a new artistic movement, which would reflect life and history more realistically and Impressionism and Realism came into dominance. Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message. Albanian artists continue to move art forward, while their art still remains distinctively Albanian in content. Though among Albanian artist postmodernism was fairly recently introduced, there is a number of artists and works known internationally. = Architecture = Butrint is a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1992. The country's architecture reflect a rich variety of architectural styles and is rooted in its history, culture and religion. Influences from distant social, religious and exotic communities have contributed to the variety of the architectural landscape in Albania that is richly revealed by archaeological finds that nonetheless retains a certain amount of continuity across history. Some of the earliest productions, notably from Illyrians, Ancient Greeks and Romans, are found scattered throughout the country. The best collection of Ancient architecture can be found in Butrint in the southwest, Apollonia, Durr√´s and Byllis in the west and Amantia and Phoenice in the south. Religion and kingship do not seem to have played an important role in the planning of these towns at that time. In the Middle Ages a variety of architecture styles developed in the form of dwelling, defense, worship and engineering structures. The consolidation of Albanian principalities gave rise to Varosha, or neighborhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are centred in Petrele, Kruj√´, Tepelen√´ and Lezh√´ originating from the feudal castle. Some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading Ottoman forces. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus. Much earlier, the introduction of Christianity brought churches and monasteries which otherwhile became the center of most towns and cities in the country. Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques are also on the best examples and legacies of Byzantines and Ottomans, which are specifically exemplified in Berat, Gjirokast√´r and Kor√ß√´ region. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities. This can be particularly seen in Tirana and Kor√ß√´. They introduced architectural styles such as Historicism, Art Nouveau, Neo-Renaissance and Neoclassicism. = Clothing = Albanians wearing fustanellas, the national costume of Albania. Traditional Albanian clothing developed as a result of long processes that has differentiated the country from other countries. Its recorded history of clothing goes back to the classical times. It includes more than two hundred different forms of clothings in all Albania and neighbouring countries that includes without limitation the Albanians in Kosovo, Western North Macedonia, Southern Montenegro, Italy and Greece. Nothing less than each cultural and geographical region of Albania has its own specific variety of costume being particularly colorful and rich in detail. The costumes are often decorated with pagan symbolic elements of Illyrians among others suns, eagles, moons, stars and snakes. The costumes are most often worn with connection to special events and celebrations, mostly at ethnic festivals, religious holidays, weddings and by dancing groups. Some conservative old men and women mainly from the high northern as well as southern lands wear those costumes in their daily lives. They was made mainly of products from the local agriculture and livestock such as leather, wool, linen, hemp fiber and silk. The textiles nowadays are still embroidered in very claborate ancient patterns. Among the most important parts of clothing includes the Qeleshe, or also known as Plis, the Albanian hat, the Qylaf√´, the Fustanella, the Xhubleta, the Xhamadan, the Brez, the √áorape, the Opinga and many others. = Music = The lahuta is used mostly by Gheg Albanians of northern Albania and Kosovo. The Albanian music is very diverse and comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. Folk music is a prominent part of the national identity with major stylistic differences between the traditional music of the northern Ghegs and southern Labs and Tosks. The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south. Albanian folk music has been influential in neighboring areas such as Kosovo, Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey, all home to significant numbers of Albanians. The Ghegs are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of the songs are about the ancient history of the country and the constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge. In contrast, Tosk music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature. Notably, Albanian iso-polyphony from the south has been declared an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Along with the def, √ßifteli and sharki are used in the north in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade wind instruments are traditionally used by shepherds in northern Albania; these include the zumar√´ and lahuta. The southern people are known for ensembles consisting of violins, clarinets, lahuta and def as well. Music in Albania extends to ancient Illyria and Greece, with influences from the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman Empire. It is evident in archeological findings such as arenas, odeons, theatre buildings and amphitheatres, all over Albania. The remains of temples, libraries, sculptures and paintings of ancient dancers, singers and musical instruments, have been found in territories inhabited by the ancient Illyrians and ancient Greeks. The tradition of church singing was performed throughout the Middle Ages in the country's territory by choirs or soloists in ecclesiastical centers such as Berat, Durr√´s and Shkod√´r. The Middle Ages in Albania included choral music and traditional music. Sh√´n Jan Kukuzeli, a singer, composer and musical innovator of Albanian origin, is one of the earliest known musicians. Albania has experienced another wave of Western cultural influence, which led to the development of many previously unknown phenomena. The most vivid example is the Albanian rock, hip hop and pop music, with some performers gaining international recognition of Albanian origin from Albania, Kosovo or Albanian diaspora, such as Action Bronson, Ava Max, Bebe Rexha, Dua Lipa, Era Istrefi, Elvana Gjata, Dafina Zeqiri, Albert Stanaj, G4SHI, Ermal Meta, Enca, Noizy and Rita Ora. Classical music became immensely popular in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and was known across even the most rural sections of the country. It was defined by the tension between classical composer Martin Gjoka along with Fan Noli and Mikel Koliqi, who embraced national identity and added religious and folk elements to their compositions. Most notable Albanian sopranos and tenors have gained also international recognition, among the best known are Inva Mula, Marie Kraja, Saimir Pirgu and Ermonela Jaho. = Dance = The Albanians have a rich tradition of dances with a great diversity of choreography and styles varying on the region due mainly to the fact that Albania is a country with a diverse topography thus the different varieties of dance developed. A couple of dances are ancient and to a certain extent persist nowadays. The dances of the Albanians specifically of the Ghegs from the north have more a solo character than those from the southern Tosks that have more social character, expressed in line and semi circle dances.  Language  Distribution of speakers of the Albanian language. Albanian is the most widely spoken language in Albania. It has two major distinct dialects: Tosk spoken in the south and Gheg spoken in the north. The geographical dividing line between those dialects appears to be the river of Shkumbin. Moreover, Albanian dialects are traditional local varieties and are traced back to the different Albanian tribes. Albanian is an Indo-European language and occupies an independent branch within this family. Scholars and linguists argue that Albanian derives from the ancient Illyrian language, which were spoken in the western part of the Balkan Peninsula by Illyrian tribes.Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture By J. P. Mallory, Douglas Q. Adams Edition: illustrated Published by Taylor & Francis, 1997 , (\\"Although there are some lexical items that appear to be shared between Romanian (and by extension Dacian) and Albanian, by far the strongest connections can be argued between Albanian and Illyrian.\\" page 11) Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World By Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Contributor Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Edition: illustrated Published by Elsevier, 2008 , (\\"Albanian constitutes a single branch of the Indo-European family of languages. It is often held to be related to Illyrian, a poorly attested language spoken in the Western Balkans in classical times\\" page 22) Today, the language is spoken primarily in Kosovo, North Macedonia, Greece and Montenegro as well. Due to the large Albanian diaspora around the world, centuries-old communities speaking Albanian-based dialects can be particularly found scattered in Greece (Arvanitika, Cham), Italy (Arb√´resh√´), Southern Serbia and in Croatia (Arbanasi). However, the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in Southern Europe. The four dialects include Tosk Albanian, Gheg Albanian, Arb√´resh and Arvanitika. Most Albanians are multi-lingual, speaking many regional and foreign languages such as Greek, Italian, Serbo- Croatian, English and others. = Mythology = The mythology of Albania consist of myths, legends, folklore, fairy tales and gods of the Albanian people. Many characters in its mythology are included in the Songs of the Frontier Warriors (Albanian: K√´ng√´ Kreshnik√´sh or Cikli i Kreshnik√´ve). It is divided into two major groups such as legends of metamorphosis and historical legends. The Albanian mythology has its origin to the ancient Illyrians, that inhabited the modern area of Albania during the classical time. Some of the legends, songs and characters include Bardha, Baloz, E Bukura e Dheut, E Bukura e Qiellit, En, Per√´ndi, Prende, Tomor and Zana e malit. = Literature = Naum Veqilharxhi lawyer and scholar (1797‚Äì1854) The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the catholic region in the North, but also of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for the German people. The Meshari (The Missal) by Gjon Buzuku, published in 1555 is considered as one of the first literary works of written Albanian. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre- dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century. Parashqevi Qiriazi teacher and feminist (1880‚Äì1970) Ismail Kadare The earliest evidence dates from 1332 AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, Archbishop of Antivari, who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a baptism formula (Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit) from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of Durr√´s, Pal Engj√´lli; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the Gospel of Matthew, also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters. Albanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist Marin Barleti, who, in his book Rrethimi i Shkodr√´s (The Siege of Shkod√´r) (1504), confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (in vernacula lingua) as well as his famous biography of Skanderbeg Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis (History of Skanderbeg) (1508). The History of Skanderbeg is still the foundation of Scanderbeg studies, and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the catechism E mb√´suame krishter√´ (Christian Teachings) by Lek√´ Matr√´nga in 1592, Doktrina e krishter√´ (The Christian Doctrine) in 1618, and Rituale romanum in 1621 by Pjet√´r Budi, the first writer of original Albanian prose and poetry, an apology for George Castriot in 1636 by Frang Bardhi, who also published a dictionary and folklore creations, the theological- philosophical treaty Cuneus Prophetarum (The Band of Prophets) in 1685 by Pjet√´r Bogdani, the most universal personality of Albanian Middle Ages, were published in Albanian. Today, the most famous Albanian writer is probably Ismail Kadare.  Wedding traditions  Kol√´ Idromeno (1860‚Äì1939): Wedding in Shkodra, 1924. The dress of the Muslim bride is characterized by its elegance and transparency, in that of the Catholic one can see full colors. The Catholic bride's dress is characterized by its picturesque effects and harmony. There are two types of Muslim wedding dresses. One is worked on a \\"shajak\\" (large piece of wool) and with floral motives worked with \\"gajtan\\" (kind of rope) black cotton, sometimes mixed with green. The other one is worked in the same material but with red color. Different from the first here the motifs are enriched with full colors. The difference between this two dresses that at the first dress the motifs occupy all the area, at the second it occupies a little part in the front and back. These dresses have a belt worked with gold and grain necklaces in red, rose, orange creating all together a warm surface. Here the motifs are very small. ;Dress of Catholic Shkodran Bride The dress is tripped from the transparent white, shiny, soft, which spreads all over the body, and is intended to suggest tranquility and a warm purity. This concept of tradition is achieved through the white of the base material and the gold thread over. This dress is composed by the \\"barnaveke\\": some kind of very long pants which seem a skirt. ;Paja Ritual songs name various elements which contain \\"paja\\" (pronounced paya) of the girl, which are the goods parents give to the daughter to wear, to furnish the house, gifts for her husband and the intimate cousins. Elements are typically made by weaving clothes using looms. The preparation of the \\"paja\\" for the parents of the bride is a pleasure which means also accomplishing the obligations toward the daughter. ;Dhuntia \\"Dhunti\\" in Shkodra means the gifts that the groom prepares for the bride during the engagement, mainly clothes, jewelry, gold ornaments and tricks, which are sent to her a few days before the wedding. In addition to those received by the family of his father, the bride takes many gifts from the groom and his family. \\"Dhuntia\\", which had a considerable monetary value, was prepared with great care by the family of the boy, because in some way embodied respect and love for his young bride, to whom these gifts were made, love for their son that he married at the same time was also a representation of the family in its economic and aesthetic. In \\"dhunti\\" there were enough clothes and items for use at all times, in joy and in sorrow, which expressed particular attention to the role of women.

King Edward VI had declared her his heir, and she occupied the English throne from 10 July until 19 July 1553. Guildford Dudley had a humanist education and was married to Jane in a magnificent celebration about six weeks before the King's death. After Guildford's father, the Duke of Northumberland, had engineered Jane's accession, Jane and Guildford spent her brief rule residing in the Tower of London. They were still in the Tower when their regime collapsed and they remained there, in different quarters, as prisoners. They were condemned to death for high treason in November 1553. Queen Mary I was inclined to spare their lives, but Thomas Wyatt's rebellion against Mary's plans to marry Philip of Spain led to the young couple's execution, a measure that was widely seen as unduly harsh. Family and marriage Coat of arms of the Dudley family Lord Guildford Dudley was the second youngest surviving son of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and his wife, Jane Guildford.Loades 1996 p. 238 The Dudley lineage goes back to a family called Sutton. In the early 14th century they became the lords of Dudley Castle,Wilson 1981 pp. 1‚Äì4 from whom Guildford descended through his paternal grandfather. This was Edmund Dudley, a councillor of Henry VII, who in 1510, after the accession of Henry VIII, was executed. Through his father's mother, Elizabeth Grey, Viscountess Lisle, Guildford descended from the Hundred Years War heroes, Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, and John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.Wilson 1981 pp. 1, 3; Adams 2002 pp. 312‚Äì313 The thirteen Dudley children grew up in a Protestant household and received a humanist education.Adams 2008; Chapman 1962 p. 65 Under the young King Edward VI, Guildford's father became Lord President of the Council and de facto ruled England from 1550‚Äì1553.Loades 1996 pp. 147, 285 The chronicler Richard Grafton, who knew him,Ives 2009 p. 275 described Guildford as \\"a comely, virtuous and goodly gentleman\\".Ives 2009 p. 185 In 1552 Northumberland unsuccessfully tried to arrange a marriage between Guildford and Margaret Clifford.Loades 1996 pp. 226, 238 Instead, in the spring of 1553, Guildford was engaged to the sixteen-year-old Jane Grey.Ives 2009 pp. 185, 36 Jane Grey and Margaret Clifford were both great- granddaughters of King Henry VII, but Jane figured higher in the line of succession. On 25 May 1553, three weddings were celebrated at Durham Place, the Duke of Northumberland's town mansion. Guildford married Jane; his sister Katherine married Henry Hastings, the Earl of Huntingdon's heir; and Jane's sister Katherine married Lord Herbert, the heir of the Earl of Pembroke.de Lisle 2008 pp. 93, 304; Ives 2009 p. 321 It was a magnificent festival, with jousts, games, and masques. For the latter, two different companies had been booked, one male, one female. The Venetian and French ambassadors were guests, and there were \\"large numbers of the common people ... and of the most principal of the realm\\". Guildford and some others suffered an attack of food poisoning, because of \\"a mistake made by a cook, who plucked one leaf for another\\".Chapman 1962 p. 82 De facto king The Crown Offered to Lady Jane Grey, as imagined in the 1820s: Guildford and Jane are in the centre King Edward, in his \\"Device of the Succession\\", settled the Crown on his cousin once removed, Jane Grey, bypassing his half-sisters, Mary and Elizabeth. After Edward's death on 6 July 1553 the Duke of Northumberland undertook the enforcement of the King's will.Alford 2002 pp. 171‚Äì172 The envoys of the Holy Roman Empire and France were sure of the plan's success.Loades 1996 p. 256‚Äì257 Jane was reluctant to accept the Crown: She gave in after remonstrances by an assembly of nobles, including her parents and in-laws; Guildford chimed in with a lovelier approach, with \\"prayers and caresses\\".Ives 2009 p. 187 On 10 July Jane and Guildford made their ceremonial entry into the Tower of London.Ives 2009 p. 188 Residing in there, Guildford wanted to be made king; according to her own later account, Jane had a long discussion about this with Guildford, who \\"assented that if he were to be made king, he would be so by me, by Act of Parliament\\".Ives 2009 p. 189 But then, Jane would agree only to make him Duke of Clarence; Guildford replied that he did not want to be a duke, but king.Ives 2009 p. 189 When the Duchess of Northumberland heard of the argument she became furious and forbade Guildford to sleep any longer with his wife. She also commanded him to leave the Tower and go home, but Jane insisted that he remain at court at her side.Chapman 1962 pp. 117‚Äì118; Ives 2009 p. 189 According to later remarks by the Imperial ambassadors, the daily Council meetings were presided over by Guildford, who allegedly also dined in state alone and had himself addressed in regal style.Ives 2009 pp. 189, 241 Antoine de Noailles, the French ambassador, described Guildford as \\"the new King\\".Chapman 1962 p. 121 The Imperial court in Brussels also believed in the existence of King Guildford. Imprisonment On 10 July, the same day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and demanding the obedience of the Council.Chapman 1962 p. 122 Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not.Ives 2009 p. 198 The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20 July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning.Ives 2009 pp. 246, 241‚Äì242, 243‚Äì244 On 19 July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford.Ives 2009 p. 215 The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.Ives 2009 pp. 184, 241 A majority of the Privy Council moved out of the Tower before switching their allegiance.Ives 2009 p. 214 Becoming aware of his colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to.Ives 2009 p. 241 Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert.Ives 2009 p. 249; Wilson 1981 p. 59 His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.Wilson 1981 pp. 59, 62, 63 Jane and Guildford were indicted on 12 August,Ives 2009 p. 247 and Jane submitted a letter of explanation to the Queen, \\"asking forgiveness ... for the sin she was accused of, informing her majesty about the truth of events.\\"Ives 2009 p. 18 In this account she spoke of herself as \\"a wife who loves her husband\\".Ives 2009 p. 186 On 13 November 1553 Jane and Guildford were tried at Guildhall, together with Archbishop Cranmer and Guildford's brothers Ambrose and Henry. They were all convicted of high treason after pleading guilty.Nichols 1850 p. 32; Ives 2009 pp. 251‚Äì252 Guildford was convicted of compassing to depose Queen Mary I by sending troops to the Duke of Northumberland, and by proclaiming and honouring Jane as queen.Bellamy 1979 p. 54 In December, Jane was allowed to walk freely in the Queen's Garden.Ives 2009 pp. 252, 355 Lord Robert and Lord Guildford had to be content with taking the air on the leads of the Bell Tower.Nichols 1850 p. 33 Jane and Guildford may have had some contact with each other,Ives 2009 p. 252; Wilson 1981 p. 59 and at some point Guildford wrote a message to his father-in-law in Jane's prayer book: > Your loving and obedient son wishes unto your grace long life in this world > with as much joy and comfort as ever I wish to myself, and in the world to > come joy everlasting. Your humble son to his death, G. Dudley Execution Queen Mary I's plan to marry Philip II of Spain was greeted with widespread opposition, not just among the populace but also among Members of Parliament and privy councillors. Thomas Wyatt's rebellion in early 1554, in which the Duke of Suffolk took part, was a result of this dislike.Ives 2009 pp. 261‚Äì262 It was not the intention of the conspirators to bring Jane Grey to the throne again. Nevertheless, the government, at the height of the military crisis around 7 February, decided to execute Jane and her husband, possibly out of panic. It was also an opportunity for removing possible inspirations for future unrest and unwelcome reminders of the past.Ives 2009 pp. 265‚Äì268 It troubled Mary to let her cousin die, but she accepted the Privy Council's advice.Porter 2007 p. 302 Bishop Gardiner pressed for the young couple's execution in a court sermon,Ives 2009 p. 268 and the Imperial ambassador Simon Renard was happy to report that \\"Jane of Suffolk and her husband are to lose their heads.\\"Chapman 1962 p. 190 The day before their executions Guildford asked Jane for a last meeting, which she refused, explaining it \\"would only ... increase their misery and pain, it was better to put it off ... as they would meet shortly elsewhere, and live bound by indissoluble ties.\\"Ives 2009 p. 274 Around ten o'clock in the morning of 12 February Guildford was led towards Tower Hill, where \\"many ... gentlemen\\" waited to shake hands with him.Nichols 1850 p. 55; Ives 2009 p. 274‚Äì275 Guildford made a short speech to the assembled crowd, as was customary.Chapman 1962 p. 204 \\"Having no ghostly father with him\\",Nichols 1850 p. 55 he knelt, prayed, and asked the people to pray for him, \\"holding up his eyes and hands to God many times\\". He was killed with one stroke of the axe, after which his body was conveyed on a cart to the Tower chapel of St Peter ad Vincula. Watching the scene from her window, Jane exclaimed: \\"Oh, Guildford, Guildford!\\" He was buried in the chapel with Jane, who was dead within the hour.Chapman 1962 p. 203 The executions did not contribute to Mary or the government's popularity. Five months after the couple's death, John Knox, the famous Scottish reformer, wrote of them as \\"innocents ... such as by just laws and faithful witnesses can never be proved to have offended by themselves.\\" Of Guildford, the chronicler Grafton wrote ten years later: \\"even those that never before the time of his execution saw him, did with lamentable tears bewail his death.\\" See also *Cultural depictions of Lady Jane Grey *Lady Jane Grey *Tudor Rose (film) FootnotesCitationsReferences *Adams, Simon (2002): Leicester and the Court: Essays in Elizabethan Politics Manchester University Press *Adams, Simon (2008): \\"Dudley, Robert, earl of Leicester (1532/3‚Äì1588)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online edn.

It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as cheese, chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water. History alt= The earliest omelettes are believed to have originated in ancient Persia. According to Breakfast: A History, they were \\"nearly indistinguishable\\" from the Iranian dish kookoo sabzi. According to Alan Davidson, the French word omelette () came into use during the mid-16th century, but the versions alumelle and alumete are employed by the M√©nagier de Paris (II, 5) in 1393.\\"Omelette\\" Rabelais (Pantagruel, IV, 9) mentions an homelaicte d'oeufs,\\"En pareille alliance, l'un appeloit une sienne, mon homelaicte. Elle le nommoit mon oeuf, et estoient alli√©s comme une homelaicte d'oeufs\\". Olivier de Serres an amelette, Fran√ßois Pierre La Varenne's Le cuisinier fran√ßois (1651) has aumelette, and the modern omelette appears in Cuisine bourgeoise (1784).Three noted by Maguelonne Toussaint- Samat, (Anthea Bell, tr.) A History of Food, revised ed, 2009, p. 326; de Serres note \\"Le glossaire accadien\\" According to the founding legend of the annual giant Easter omelette of Bessi√®res, Haute-Garonne, when Napoleon Bonaparte and his army were traveling through southern France, they decided to rest for the night near the town of Bessi√®res. Napoleon feasted on an omelette prepared by a local innkeeper, and thought it was a culinary delight. He then ordered the townspeople to gather all the eggs in the village and to prepare a huge omelette for his army the next day. Alexander Dumas discusses several variations of omelet in his Grand dictionnaire de cuisine. One is an omelet with fresh herbs (parsley, chives and tarragon, another is a variation with mushrooms that Dumas says may be adapted using green peas, asparagus, spinach, sorrel or varieties of truffles. The \\"kirsch omelet\\" (or rum omelet) is a sweet omelet made with sugar and liquor, either kirsh or rum. The omelet is rolled and sprinkled with powdered sugar. A hot poker is used to burn a design into the omelet and it is served with a sweet sauce made of liquor and apricot jam. Another sweet omelet, attributed to a royal cook of Prussia, is made with apples and brown sugar glaze. Of the Arabian omelet, Dumas writes \\"I have been concerned in this book to give the recipes of peoples who have no true cuisine. Here, for example, is a recipe the Bey's cook was good enough to give me.\\" The omelet itself is made with an ostrich egg and served with a spicy tomato-pepper sauce.Alexandre Dumas' Dictionary of Cuisine, 1873 Variations by country=China= * Egg foo yung, a Cantonese omelette made with beaten eggs and usually hamEgg Foo Yung * An oyster omelette, a dish of Hokkien and Teochew origin made with oysters, starch and egg batter =France= Omelette de la m√®re Poulard * Depending on sources, a standard omelette is cooked in butter on medium (or sometimes high) heat, is supposed to be golden brown or \\"unbrowned or very lightly browned\\" on the outside and soft in the insideGinette Mathiot (√©d), La Cuisine pour tous, 1955, p.107 : \\"(...) laissez cuire √† feu vif.

Another thin layer of egg is then added to the bottom of the pan and is again rolled, with the original rolled, cooked egg at the centre, over to the other end of the pan. This is repeated until all the egg has been used up, resulting in a dense cylindrical omelette containing many thin layers. This is then squeezed into a rectangular or circular cross-section using a sushi mat, and sliced into segments for serving.

Written in the form of an autobiography of the Roman Emperor Claudius, it tells the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty and the early years of the Roman Empire, from Julius Caesar's assassination in 44 BC to Caligula's assassination in AD 41. Though the narrative is largely fictionalized, most of the events depicted are drawn from historical accounts of the same time period by the Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus. The \\"autobiography\\" continues in a sequel, Claudius the God (1935), which covers the period from Claudius' accession to his death in AD 54. The sequel also includes a section written as a biography of Herod Agrippa, a contemporary of Claudius and a King of the Jews. The two books were adapted by the BBC into the award-winning television serial I, Claudius in 1976. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked I, Claudius fourteenth on its list of the 100 best English- language novels of the 20th century.100 Best Novels, Modern Library In 2005, the novel was chosen by Time as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to present. Novels=Historical context= Claudius was the fourth Emperor of the Roman Empire, from AD 41 to 54. A grandson of Mark Antony and great-nephew of Augustus, he was a member of the Julio-Claudian family, Rome's first imperial ruling family. Claudius' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer, limp, and other nervous tics, which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives. Even as his symptoms began to wane in his teenage years, he ran into trouble as a budding historian; his work on a history of the Roman civil wars was too truthful and too critical of the reigning emperor Augustus, and his mother Antonia Minor and grandmother Livia quickly put a stop to it. This episode reinforced their initial suspicions that Claudius was not fit for public office. Claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history, and Graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot. Graves' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of Gaius Cornelius Tacitus, Plutarch, and (especially) Suetonius' Lives of the Twelve Caesars. Graves translated Suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading Suetonius, Claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told. The life of Claudius provided Graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of Rome from an intimate point of view. I, Claudius is written as a first-person narrative of Roman history from Claudius' perspective, covering the reigns of Augustus, Tiberius, and Caligula; Claudius the God is written as a later addition documenting Claudius' own reign. The real Claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography (now lost) in eight books that covered the same period. Graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional Claudius describe a visit to Cumae, where he receives a prophecy in verse from the Sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of \\"Sibylline Curiosities\\". The latter concerns the fates of the \\"hairy ones\\" (i.e. the Caesars ‚Äì from the Latin word \\"caesar\\", meaning \\"a fine head of hair\\") who are to rule Rome. The penultimate verse concerns his reign and Claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy. Graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of Claudius the God when Claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by Nero. At Cumae, the Sibyl tells Claudius that he will \\"speak clear\\". Claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he, having written the truth, will speak clearly, while his contemporaries, who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family, will seem like stammerers. Since he wishes to record his life for posterity, Claudius explains that he chooses to write in Greek, which he believes will remain \\"the chief literary language of the world\\". This enables Graves' Claudius to offer explanations of Latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native Latin speakers. =I, Claudius= Writing in the first- person (from an unspecified time period, presumably late in his own reign as emperor), Claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth, which includes harsh criticisms of the deified Augustus and especially of Livia. The narrative begins prior to his own birth, as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the Roman Principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of Augustus as emperor despite Augustus' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former Republic. During his prosperous reign, Augustus is plagued by personal losses as his favored heirs, Marcellus, Marcus Agrippa, Gaius Caesar, and Lucius Caesar, die. Claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of Augustus' third wife Livia (who is also Claudius' paternal grandmother), a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son Tiberius (Claudius' uncle) succeed Augustus as the next emperor. As these intrigues occur, the sickly Claudius is born and is immediately shunned and mocked by his family. Only his brother Germanicus and his cousin Postumus treat him with any kindness. He is eventually given a great tutor, the reputable historian Athenodorus, who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young Claudius. During these early years, Claudius is advised by his idol Asinius Pollio to play the fool to survive. Postumus is eventually framed for raping Claudius' sister Livilla and beating his own niece Aemilia; Augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of Italy, but not before Postumus reveals the truth to Claudius. Claudius then passes this on to Germanicus, who convinces Augustus of Postumus' innocence. Augustus exchanges the exiled Postumus with a double named Clemens and secretly writes a will restoring Postumus as his heir, but Livia manages to discover this and poisons Augustus. Upon Augustus' death, Tiberius is declared emperor, though his mother Livia retains her power and influence as empress. The Roman legions campaigning in Germany refuse to accept the unpopular Tiberius and begin to mutiny, instead declaring Germanicus emperor. Shocked and confused, Germanicus refuses, declaring his loyalty to Tiberius. He sends his wife Agrippina and youngest son Caligula away from the military frontier and asks Claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers. Claudius agrees and pretends that they are gambling debts. With the money and the return of Caligula, Germanicus ends the mutiny and leads several successful campaigns in Germany. In the midst of this, Claudius is informed that Postumus is alive and secretly forming a resistance group to take back his rightful place in Rome. Claudius' letters to Germanicus about Postumus are intercepted by Livia; Postumus is later captured and executed by Tiberius. Livia, recognizing that Claudius is a threat, sends him to Carthage to prevent him from having contact with Germanicus. Growing to fear Germanicus' popularity more and more, Tiberius sends a hostile governor, Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, to spy on Germanicus. Germanicus soon becomes plagued by witchcraft before dying of poison. It is later revealed that Germanicus' son Caligula was the instigator of the witchcraft. As Tiberius becomes more hated by the public, he increasingly relies on his Praetorian Captain Sejanus to administer his edicts and punishments, who is able to manipulate Tiberius into suspecting that Germanicus' wife Agrippina and his own son Castor are plotting to usurp the monarchy. Sejanus meanwhile secretly plots with Livilla to usurp the monarchy for himself by poisoning Castor and systematically eliminating any ally of Agrippina and her sons. Agrippina only survives due to the protection of Livia, who holds vital information regarding Augustus' true opinion of Tiberius. Livia then hosts a surprising dinner, to which Claudius and Caligula are invited. She predicts that Caligula (and not his older brothers) will become emperor and that Claudius will succeed him. She privately admits to Claudius to having ordered the poisonings and assassinations of many people, and then begs Claudius to swear to deify her as a goddess, believing it will grant her a blissful afterlife, to which he agrees. Claudius is later invited to Livia's deathbed and reveals that Caligula betrayed his promise. Claudius swears that Livia will become the Queen of Heaven, which moves Livia to declare he is no fool before she dies. Tiberius, now free of Livia, loses all compunction and executes hundreds of influential citizens on false charges of treason. He banishes Agrippina and her son Nero, while Agrippina's son Drusus is imprisoned and starved to death in Rome. Tiberius retreats from public life to the island of Capri and Sejanus is given full command of the city in his absence, becoming de facto ruler of Rome. Tiberius is soon alerted to Sejanus' treachery by a letter from Antonia Minor and allies himself with Caligula, despite his awareness of Caligula's growing wickedness and narcissism, and transfers control of Rome to the even more despotic Naevius Sutorius Macro. Sejanus is executed along with his children; Claudius survives despite being married to Sejanus' sister, whom he quickly divorces. Livilla is locked in a room by her mother Antonia and starved to death, and Antonia punishes herself for having raised Livilla by listening to her daughter die. On his deathbed, the old and feeble Tiberius is smothered to death by Macro. Caligula is declared emperor and at first appears to be enlightened and kind. To his surprise, Claudius is recalled to Rome from his peaceful life in Capua writing history and living with his prostitute companion Calpurnia. Claudius quickly becomes the butt of many taunts and practical jokes by the Imperial Court. After recovering from a severe illness, Caligula descends into madness, his behavior becoming ever more egomaniacal and irrational. He declares himself a god in human disguise, stages arguments and battles with other gods, bankrupts the country, and kills thousands. The madness having reached a tempest is finally quelled by Cassius Chaerea, a captain of the Praetorian Guard who plots with the other captains to assassinate Caligula, along with his wife and daughter. Horrified, Claudius hides behind a curtain and is discovered by a disgruntled Praetorian Guard. Realizing they need a new emperor, the Guards suddenly and bemusedly declare Claudius emperor. Claudius pleads that he does not want to be emperor and only wants to see the Republic restored, but the Guards ignore him. He sadly accepts for the sake of his wife and unborn child, and for the access the emperorship will give him to valuable historical documents, on a whim deciding that as emperor he will finally be able to demand that people read his books. =Claudius the God= The story begins with an apology by Claudius for having ended his first history on a dramatic point and continues with a brief history of his friend Herod Agrippa. Herod was a schoolmate of Claudius and was liked by Claudius' mother Antonia. Herod always finds himself in debts and danger in the East and in Rome. He eventually gains the favour of Caligula and is made King of Bashan. Herod is in Rome when Caligula is assassinated and quickly is able to convince Claudius to accept the emperorship in order to avoid civil war. Claudius reluctantly executes Cassius Chaerea and several of the other assassins and begins tirelessly working for the sake of Rome. He applies himself to the law courts, demonstrates his intelligence in being able to locate one of Augustus' lost Eagles, and orders the building of a harbour in Ostia to help preserve the Roman food supply. Claudius is also able to quell two mutinies and conquers Britain. Herod Agrippa conspires to take over the East, as he regards himself as the Messiah. When he announces this he breaks the first commandment by declaring himself a god. Herod quickly dies a painful death, just as his grandfather had died, imploring Claudius to forgive him and not to trust anyone. Throughout Claudius' reign he is unwittingly manipulated by his adulterous wife Messalina, who kills many of her enemies as well as being involved in bribery. She eventually conspires to usurp the monarchy with her lover Gaius Silius. Claudius is distraught and crushed by this news and is given an \\"Olympian Mixture\\" in order to manage through the ordeal. Claudius arrests Silius and the leaders of the coup. Messalina is executed without Claudius' consent and Claudius has no reaction during his \\"Olympian\\" state, even bemusedly joking about being worshipped as a god in Britain. On being relieved of the \\"Olympian Mixture\\", Claudius is crushed and decides that the only way the Republic can be restored is by having a true mad monarch rather than the reign of a benevolent one. Comparing himself to the fable of the frogs who desired a King, Claudius privately refers to himself as \\"Old King Log\\" and plays a weak and easily manipulated fool. He then incestuously marries his niece Agrippinilla, whom he openly despises. In his feeble old age Claudius excessively enjoys gladiatorial games, is often intoxicated, and makes himself oblivious to Agrippinilla's schemes to gain power and make her son Nero emperor. Foreseeing that Nero will be a terrible ruler, Claudius plans on having his son Britannicus removed to live with the Northern Britons and later to return as Rome's saviour. Britannicus refuses and admits that while he loves the Republic, the Republic is dead and he wants to challenge Nero for the right to rule Rome as an emperor. Dismayed, Claudius agrees, knowing that he is sending his son to his death. Claudius resignedly accepts that his death will be soon with numerous signs suggesting such. Literary significance and criticism The I, Claudius novels, as they are called collectively, became massively popular when first published in 1934 and gained literary recognition with the award of the 1934 James Tait Black Prize for fiction. They remain Graves' best known work, aside from his myth essay The White Goddess, his English translation of The Golden Ass, and his own autobiography Good-Bye to All That. Graves later claimed that the novels were written only from financial need on a strict deadline. Nonetheless, they are today regarded as pioneering masterpieces of historical fiction. Adaptations=German translation= When the time came to translate the novels into German, Graves, who spoke the language, decided instead to rework them into a one volume edition. He collaborated with translator Hans Rothe and they jointly produced a shortened edition which left out the many digressions which were incorporated into the English original, with the aim of presenting Claudius' story in a clearer and more effective way. The contents of the books were thus roughly cut down to a half. Graves' own preface to the German edition as published by Paul List, M√ºnchen (1947) ‚Äì The book is published as Ich Claudius, Kaiser und Gott (I Claudius, Emperor and God) with Graves being styled Robert von Ranke Graves, which is how he is credited in all German editions of his works. =Film and television= In 1937, abortive attempts were made to adapt the first book into a film by the film director Josef von Sternberg. The producer was Alexander Korda, who was then married to Merle Oberon, who was cast as Claudius' wife Messalina. Emlyn Williams was cast as Caligula, Charles Laughton was cast as Claudius, and Flora Robson was cast as Livia. Filming was abandoned after Oberon was injured in a serious motor car accident. Much of the footage completed for the film was included in The Epic That Never Was, a 1965 TV documentary about the abortive production. In 1976, BBC Television adapted the book and its sequel into the popular TV serial I, Claudius, starring Derek Jacobi, Si√¢n Phillips, Brian Blessed, and John Hurt. The production was awarded three BAFTAs in 1977 and an Emmy in 1978. In 2008, it was reported that Relativity Media had obtained the rights to produce a new film adaptation of I, Claudius. Jim Sheridan was named as director. In 2011, rights then passed to HBO and BBC2 to film a miniseries adaptation. Jane Tranter and Anne Thomopoulos, who previously worked on HBO/BBC2's miniseries Rome have been named as producers. =Radio= In November and December 2010, as part of the Classic Serial strand, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a series of six hour-long episodes of a dramatisation of both novels, adapted by Robin Brooks and directed by Jonquil Panting. Performers were Derek Jacobi, Tom Goodman Hill and full cast. It won the 2012 Audie Award in the \\"Audio Dramatization\\" category.I Claudius, AudioGo, 2011. =Comics= An episode from \\"Claudius the God\\" was adapted for comics in the EC Comics Two-Fisted Tales #36, in a story titled \\"Battle!\\", written by Colin Dwakins and drawn by Reed Crandall. =Theatre= The novel has also been adapted for theatre. The 1972 production I, Claudius was written by John Mortimer and starred David Warner. =Audio= Several audio recordings of the novel have been produced. Derek Jacobi performed two separate readings of the novel, both as abridged versions, one for Dove Audio (1986) and one for CSA Word (2007). Nelson Runger performed unabridged readings of both I, Claudius and Claudius the God for Recorded Books (1987). Jonathan Oliver performed an unabridged reading for ISIS Audio Books (1988). Frederick Davidson performed an unabridged reading for Blackstone Audio (1994). =Opera= The novel has also been adapted for opera by Igor Escudero under the title I, Claudius and Claudius the God (2019). The three parts, or chapters, that form the trilogy are titled Livia, Caligula and Claudius the God, and have been conceived to be performed not only sequentially, but also separately. Later references A. E. van Vogt's 1957 novel Empire of the Atom is a wholesale translation of Graves' novel into science fiction. On the last page of The Areas of My Expertise, John Hodgman includes a table comparing his \\"future works\\" with I, Claudius. In 1998, software developer C.J. Silverio noted that several long passages of the novel The Manchurian Candidate seemed to be adapted from Graves' novel. I Claudia, a 2018 novel by Mary McCoy was loosely based on I, Claudius and translates the characters into a modern day private high school with a problematic power structure.  Influences  George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has spoken of how he was inspired by I, Claudius, in particular, central character Stannis Baratheon is partially based upon Tiberius Caesar, particularly as portrayed by George Baker in the BBC television series.

In 1959 he appeared as Sicinius opposite Laurence Olivier in Coriolanus at Stratford-upon-Avon, directed by Peter Hall. He then appeared in Shakespeare's Henry V on stage and in television's An Age of Kings (1960), and subsequently played Coriolanus in The Spread of the Eagle (BBC, 1963) and Sir Toby Belch for the BBC Television Shakespeare production of Twelfth Night in 1980. Over the years, Hardy played a range of parts on television and film. His first continuing role in a TV series was as businessman Alec Stewart in the award-winning oil company drama The Troubleshooters for the BBC, which he played from 1966 to 1970. He won further acclaim for his portrayal of the mentally-unhinged Abwehr Sgt. Gratz in LWT's 1969 war drama Manhunt. In 1975, Hardy portrayed Albert, Prince Consort in the award-winning 13-hour serial Edward the Seventh (known as Edward the King to the American audience), which he regarded as one of his best performances. \\"I thought I'd done a good job there, although I believe the Royal Family didn't like it all.

Hardy also made an appearance in the 1986‚Äì88 ITV comedy series Hot Metal, in which he played the dual roles of newspaper proprietor Twiggy Rathbone (who bore more than a passing resemblance to Rupert Murdoch) and his editor, Russell Spam. In 1993 Hardy appeared in an episode of Inspector Morse, playing Andrew Baydon in \\"Twilight of the Gods\\". In 1994, he played Arthur Brooke in the BBC production of Middlemarch. In 2002, he played the role of pompous and eccentric Professor Neddy Welch in a WTTV/WGBH Boston co-production of Lucky Jim, adapted from the novel by Kingsley Amis. It aired originally as part of the Masterpiece series on PBS in the U.S. and starred Stephen Tompkinson in the title role of Jim Dixon, a luckless lecturer at a provincial British university. Hardy played both Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, each on more than one occasion. He played Churchill most notably in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), for which he was nominated for a BAFTA award, but also in The Sittaford Mystery, Bomber Harris and War and Remembrance. On 20 August 2010, he read Churchill's famous wartime address \\"Never was so much owed by so many to so few\\" at a ceremony to mark the 70th anniversary of the speech. He played Roosevelt in the BBC serial, Bertie and Elizabeth, and in the French TV mini-series, Le Grand Charles, about the life of Charles de Gaulle. He also played Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in Elizabeth R, and took the role of Sir John Middleton in the 1995 film version of Sense and Sensibility. His big screen roles included Professor Krempe in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter films. His voice performance as Robin Hood in Tale Spinners For Children, an LP from the 1960s, is considered one of the best Robin Hood renditions.\\"Tale Spinners for Children: Robin Hood\\" UAC 11001: \\"Starring Robert Hardy as Robin Hood with the Famous Theater Company and the Hollywood Studio Orchestra\\"; cf. also Arts Reformation.

An igloo (Inuit languages: , Inuktitut syllabics (plural: )), also known as a snow house or snow hut, is a type of shelter built of snow, typically built when the snow is suitable. Although igloos are often associated with all Inuit and Eskimo peoples, they were traditionally used only by the people of Canada's Central Arctic and Greenland's Thule area. Other Inuit tended to use snow to insulate their houses, which were constructed from whalebone and hides. Snow is used because the air pockets trapped in it make it an insulator. On the outside, temperatures may be as low as , but on the inside, the temperature may range from when warmed by body heat alone. Nomenclature Inuit building an igloo The Inuit language word (plural ) can be used for a house or home built of any material, and is not restricted exclusively to snowhouses (called specifically , plural ), but includes traditional tents, sod houses, homes constructed of driftwood and modern buildings. Several dialects throughout the Canadian Arctic (Siglitun, Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmiutut, Kivalliq, North Baffin) use for all buildings, including snowhouses, and it is the term used by the Government of Nunavut.Inuinnaqtun English Dictionary. Cambridge Bay, Nunavut: Nunavut Arctic College, 1996. An exception to this is the dialect used in the Igloolik region. is used for other buildings, while , (plural , Inuktitut syllabics: ) is specifically used for a snowhouse. Outside Inuit culture, however, igloo refers exclusively to shelters constructed from blocks of compacted snow, generally in the form of a dome. Types There are three traditional types of igloos, all of different sizes and used for different purposes. * The smallest are constructed as temporary shelters, usually only used for one or two nights so they are easier to build. On rare occasions these are built and used during hunting trips, often on open sea ice.A Lost Art in the Arctic: Igloo Making * Intermediate-sized igloos were for semi-permanent, family dwelling. This was usually a single room dwelling that housed one or two families. Often there were several of these in a small area, which formed an Inuit village. * The largest igloos were normally built in groups of two. One of the buildings was a temporary structure built for special occasions, the other built nearby for living. These might have had up to five rooms and housed up to 20 people. A large igloo might have been constructed from several smaller igloos attached by their tunnels, giving common access to the outside. These were used to hold community feasts and traditional dances. Construction Snow igloos are not spherical, but are built in a catenary curve, a shape more closely resembling a paraboloid. Using this shape, the stresses of snow as it ages and compresses are less likely to cause it to buckle because in an inverted paraboloid or catenoid the pressures are nearer to being exclusively compressive. If the walls are of uniform thickness and density, the maximum compressive stress at the base of a paraboloid is \\\\mathrm{S}\\\\alpha=\\\\frac{\\\\gamma\\\\mathrm{d}^{2}}{24h}\\\\cdot \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos\\\\alpha+\\\\cos^{2}\\\\alpha}{(1+\\\\cos\\\\alpha)\\\\cos^{2}\\\\alpha}, where \\\\mathrm{d} is the diameter at the base, h is the height, \\\\gamma is the unit weight of the snow, and \\\\alpha = \\\\arctan (4h/\\\\mathrm{d}). Since stress is a force per unit area, if the walls are of uniform thickness the compressive stress is independent of wall thickness; thicker walls provide better insulation but do not strengthen the structure because of added weight. The maximum compressive stress at the base of the igloo can be obtained by multiplying S,/yd times the snow unit weight y and the mean igloo base diameter. The individual snow bricks start out 4-sided and being cut out of the ground with saws and machete-like blades, but are then often cut into 5 or 6-sided shapes to increase structural interlocking, similar to the stones used in the Inca Empire. Igloos gradually become shorter with time due to the compressive creep of the snow. Building methods The snow used to build an igloo must have enough structural strength to be cut and stacked appropriately. The best snow to use for this purpose is snow which has been blown by wind, which can serve to compact and interlock the ice crystals; snow that has settled gently to the ground in still weather is not useful. The hole left in the snow where the blocks are cut is usually used as the lower half of the shelter. Snow's insulating properties enable the inside of the igloo to remain relatively warm. In some cases, a single block of clear freshwater ice is inserted to allow light into the igloo. Igloos used as winter shelters had beds made of loose snow, skins, and caribou furs. Sometimes, a short tunnel is constructed at the entrance, to reduce wind and heat loss when the door is opened. Animal skins or a snow block can be used as a door. Architecturally, the igloo is unique in that it is a dome that can be raised out of independent blocks leaning on each other and polished to fit without an additional supporting structure during construction. An igloo that is built correctly will support the weight of a person standing on the roof. Traditionally, an igloo might be deliberately consolidated immediately after construction by making a large flame with a (, stone lamp), briefly making the interior very hot, which causes the walls to melt slightly and settle. (a Norwegian observer's account of the building a family's winter igloo, not a short-term hunting one, by Atikleura and Nalungia, Netsilik Inuit) Body heat is also adequate, if slower. This melting and refreezing builds up a layer of ice that contributes to the strength of the igloo.

The precise definition of a dome has been a matter of controversy and there are a wide variety of forms and specialized terms to describe them. A dome can rest directly upon a rotunda wall, a drum, or a system of squinches or pendentives used to accommodate the transition in shape from a rectangular or square space to the round or polygonal base of the dome. A dome's apex may be closed or may be open in the form of an oculus, which may itself be covered with a roof lantern and cupola. Domes have a long architectural lineage that extends back into prehistory. Domes were built in ancient Mesopotamia, and they have been found in Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, and Chinese architecture in the ancient world, as well as among a number of indigenous building traditions throughout the world. Dome structures were common in both Byzantine architecture and Sasanian architecture, which influenced that of the rest of Europe and Islam, respectively, in the Middle Ages. The domes of European Renaissance architecture spread from Italy in the early modern period, while domes were frequently employed in Ottoman architecture at the same time. Baroque and Neoclassical architecture took inspiration from Roman domes. Advancements in mathematics, materials, and production techniques resulted in new dome types. Domes have been constructed over the centuries from mud, snow, stone, wood, brick, concrete, metal, glass, and plastic. The symbolism associated with domes includes mortuary, celestial, and governmental traditions that have likewise altered over time. The domes of the modern world can be found over religious buildings, legislative chambers, sports stadiums, and a variety of functional structures.  Etymology  The English word \\"dome\\" ultimately derives from the ancient Greek and Latin domus (\\"house\\"), which, up through the Renaissance, labeled a revered house, such as a Domus Dei, or \\"House of God\\", regardless of the shape of its roof. This is reflected in the uses of the Italian word duomo, the German/Icelandic/Danish word dom (\\"cathedral\\"), and the English word dome as late as 1656, when it meant a \\"Town-House, Guild- Hall, State-House, and Meeting-House in a city.\\" The French word dosme came to acquire the meaning of a cupola vault, specifically, by 1660. This French definition gradually became the standard usage of the English dome in the eighteenth century as many of the most impressive Houses of God were built with monumental domes, and in response to the scientific need for more technical terms.  Elements  The word \\"cupola\\" is another word for \\"dome\\", and is usually used for a small dome upon a roof or turret. \\"Cupola\\" has also been used to describe the inner side of a dome. The top of a dome is the \\"crown\\". The inner side of a dome is called the \\"intrados\\" and the outer side is called the \\"extrados\\". As with arches, the \\"springing\\" of a dome is the base level from which the dome rises and the \\"haunch\\" is the part that lies roughly halfway between the base and the top. Domes can be supported by an elliptical or circular wall called a \\"drum\\". If this structure extends to ground level, the round building may be called a \\"rotunda\\". Drums are also called \\"tholobates\\" and may or may not contain windows. A \\"tambour\\" or \\"lantern\\" is the equivalent structure over a dome's oculus, supporting a cupola. When the base of the dome does not match the plan of the supporting walls beneath it (for example, a dome's circular base over a square bay), techniques are employed to bridge the two. One technique is to use corbelling, progressively projecting horizontal layers from the top of the supporting wall to the base of the dome, such as the corbelled triangles often used in Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The simplest technique is to use diagonal lintels across the corners of the walls to create an octagonal base. Another is to use arches to span the corners, which can support more weight. A variety of these techniques use what are called \\"squinches\\". A squinch can be a single arch or a set of multiple projecting nested arches placed diagonally over an internal corner. Squinches can take a variety of other forms, as well, including trumpet arches and niche heads, or half-domes. The invention of pendentives superseded the squinch technique. Pendentives are triangular sections of a sphere, like concave spandrels between arches, and transition from the corners of a square bay to the circular base of a dome. The curvature of the pendentives is that of a sphere with a diameter equal to the diagonal of the square bay.  Definitions  Across the ancient world, curved-roof structures that would today be called domes had a number of different names reflecting a variety of shapes, traditions, and symbolic associations. The shapes were derived from traditions of pre-historic shelters made from various impermanent pliable materials and were only later reproduced as vaulting in more durable materials. The hemispherical shape often associated with domes today derives from Greek geometry and Roman standardization, but other shapes persisted, including a pointed and bulbous tradition inherited by some early Islamic mosques. Modern academic study of the topic has been controversial and confused by inconsistent definitions, such as those for cloister vaults and domical vaults. Dictionary definitions of the term \\"dome\\" are often general and imprecise. Generally-speaking, it \\"is non-specific, a blanket-word to describe an hemispherical or similar spanning element.\\" Published definitions include: hemispherical roofs alone; revolved arches; and vaults on a circular base alone, circular or polygonal base, circular, elliptical, or polygonal base,, or an undefined area. Definitions specifying vertical sections include: semicircular, pointed, or bulbous; semicircular, segmental or pointed; semicircular, segmental, pointed, or bulbous; semicircular, segmental, elliptical, or bulbous; and high profile, hemispherical, or flattened. Comparison of a generic \\"true\\" arch (left) and a corbel arch (right) Sometimes called \\"false\\" domes, corbel domes achieve their shape by extending each horizontal layer of stones inward slightly farther than the lower one until they meet at the top. A \\"false\\" dome may also refer to a wooden dome. The Italian use of the term finto, meaning \\"false\\", can be traced back to the 17th century in the use of vaulting made of reed mats and gypsum mortar. \\"True\\" domes are said to be those whose structure is in a state of compression, with constituent elements of wedge-shaped voussoirs, the joints of which align with a central point. The validity of this is unclear, as domes built underground with corbelled stone layers are in compression from the surrounding earth. The precise definition of \\"pendentive\\" has also been a source of academic contention, such as whether or not corbelling is permitted under the definition and whether or not the lower portions of a sail vault should be considered pendentives. Domes with pendentives can be divided into two kinds: simple and compound. In the case of the simple dome, the pendentives are part of the same sphere as the dome itself; however, such domes are rare. In the case of the more common compound dome, the pendentives are part of the surface of a larger sphere below that of the dome itself and form a circular base for either the dome or a drum section. The fields of engineering and architecture have lacked common language for domes, with engineering focused on structural behavior and architecture focused on form and symbolism. Additionally, new materials and structural systems in the 20th century have allowed for large dome-shaped structures that deviate from the traditional compressive structural behavior of masonry domes and popular usage of the term has expanded to mean \\"almost any long-span roofing system\\".  Materials  The earliest domes in the Middle East were built with mud-brick and, eventually, with baked brick and stone. Domes of wood allowed for wide spans due to the relatively light and flexible nature of the material and were the normal method for domed churches by the 7th century, although most domes were built with the other less flexible materials. Wooden domes were protected from the weather by roofing, such as copper or lead sheeting. Domes of cut stone were more expensive and never as large, and timber was used for large spans where brick was unavailable. Roman concrete used an aggregate of stone with a powerful mortar. The aggregate transitioned over the centuries to pieces of fired clay, then to Roman bricks. By the sixth century, bricks with large amounts of mortar were the principle vaulting materials. Pozzolana appears to have only been used in central Italy. Brick domes were the favored choice for large-space monumental coverings until the Industrial Age, due to their convenience and dependability. Ties and chains of iron or wood could be used to resist stresses. The new building materials of the 19th century and a better understanding of the forces within structures from the 20th century opened up new possibilities. Iron and steel beams, steel cables, and pre- stressed concrete eliminated the need for external buttressing and enabled much thinner domes. Whereas earlier masonry domes may have had a radius to thickness ratio of 50, the ratio for modern domes can be in excess of 800. The lighter weight of these domes not only permitted far greater spans, but also allowed for the creation of large movable domes over modern sports stadiums. Experimental rammed earth domes were made as part of work on sustainable architecture at the University of Kassel in 1983.  Shapes and internal forces  A masonry dome produces thrusts downward and outward. They are thought of in terms of two kinds of forces at right angles from one another: meridional forces (like the meridians, or lines of longitude, on a globe) are compressive only, and increase towards the base, while hoop forces (like the lines of latitude on a globe) are in compression at the top and tension at the base, with the transition in a hemispherical dome occurring at an angle of 51.8 degrees from the top. The thrusts generated by a dome are directly proportional to the weight of its materials. Grounded hemispherical domes generate significant horizontal thrusts at their haunches. The outward thrusts in the lower portion of a hemispherical masonry dome can be counteracted with the use of chains incorporated around the circumference or with external buttressing, although cracking along the meridians is natural. For small or tall domes with less horizontal thrust, the thickness of the supporting arches or walls can be enough to resist deformation, which is why drums tend to be much thicker than the domes they support. Unlike voussoir arches, which require support for each element until the keystone is in place, domes are stable during construction as each level is made a complete and self- supporting ring. The upper portion of a masonry dome is always in compression and is supported laterally, so it does not collapse except as a whole unit and a range of deviations from the ideal in this shallow upper cap are equally stable. Because voussoir domes have lateral support, they can be made much thinner than corresponding arches of the same span. For example, a hemispherical dome can be 2.5 times thinner than a semicircular arch, and a dome with the profile of an equilateral arch can be thinner still. The optimal shape for a masonry dome of equal thickness provides for perfect compression, with none of the tension or bending forces against which masonry is weak. For a particular material, the optimal dome geometry is called the funicular surface, the comparable shape in three dimensions to a catenary curve for a two-dimensional arch. Adding a weight to the top of a pointed dome, such as the heavy cupola at the top of Florence Cathedral, changes the optimal shape to more closely match the actual pointed shape of the dome. The pointed profiles of many Gothic domes more closely approximate the optimal dome shape than do hemispheres, which were favored by Roman and Byzantine architects due to the circle being considered the most perfect of forms.  Symbolism  According to E. Baldwin Smith, from the late Stone Age the dome-shaped tomb was used as a reproduction of the ancestral, god-given shelter made permanent as a venerated home of the dead. The instinctive desire to do this resulted in widespread domical mortuary traditions across the ancient world, from the stupas of India to the tholos tombs of Iberia. By Hellenistic and Roman times, the domical tholos had become the customary cemetery symbol. Domes and tent- canopies were also associated with the heavens in Ancient Persia and the Hellenistic-Roman world. A dome over a square base reflected the geometric symbolism of those shapes. The circle represented perfection, eternity, and the heavens. The square represented the earth. An octagon was intermediate between the two. The distinct symbolism of the heavenly or cosmic tent stemming from the royal audience tents of Achaemenid and Indian rulers was adopted by Roman rulers in imitation of Alexander the Great, becoming the imperial baldachin. This probably began with Nero, whose \\"Golden House\\" also made the dome a feature of palace architecture. The dual sepulchral and heavenly symbolism was adopted by early Christians in both the use of domes in architecture and in the ciborium, a domical canopy like the baldachin used as a ritual covering for relics or the church altar. The celestial symbolism of the dome, however, was the preeminent one by the Christian era. In the early centuries of Islam, domes were closely associated with royalty. A dome built in front of the mihrab of a mosque, for example, was at least initially meant to emphasize the place of a prince during royal ceremonies. Over time such domes became primarily focal points for decoration or the direction of prayer. The use of domes in mausoleums can likewise reflect royal patronage or be seen as representing the honor and prestige that domes symbolized, rather than having any specific funerary meaning. The wide variety of dome forms in medieval Islam reflected dynastic, religious, and social differences as much as practical building considerations.  Acoustics  Because domes are concave from below, they can reflect sound and create echoes. A dome may have a \\"whispering gallery\\" at its base that at certain places transmits distinct sound to other distant places in the gallery. The half-domes over the apses of Byzantine churches helped to project the chants of the clergy. Although this can complement music, it may make speech less intelligible, leading Francesco Giorgi in 1535 to recommend vaulted ceilings for the choir areas of a church, but a flat ceiling filled with as many coffers as possible for where preaching would occur. Cavities in the form of jars built into the inner surface of a dome may serve to compensate for this interference by diffusing sound in all directions, eliminating echoes while creating a \\"divine effect in the atmosphere of worship.\\" This technique was written about by Vitruvius in his Ten Books on Architecture, which describes bronze and earthenware resonators. The material, shape, contents, and placement of these cavity resonators determine the effect they have: reinforcing certain frequencies or absorbing them.  Types = Beehive dome = Also called a corbelled dome, or false dome, these are different from a 'true dome' in that they consist of purely horizontal layers. As the layers get higher, each is slightly cantilevered, or corbeled, toward the center until meeting at the top. A monumental example is the Mycenaean Treasury of Atreus from the late Bronze Age. = Braced dome = A single or double layer space frame in the form of a dome, a braced dome is a generic term that includes ribbed, Schwedler, three-way grid, lamella or Kiewitt, lattice, and geodesic domes. The different terms reflect different arrangements in the surface members. Braced domes often have a very low weight and are usually used to cover spans of up to 150 meters. Often prefabricated, their component members can either lie on the dome's surface of revolution, or be straight lengths with the connecting points or nodes lying upon the surface of revolution. Single-layer structures are called frame or skeleton types and double-layer structures are truss types, which are used for large spans. When the covering also forms part of the structural system, it is called a stressed skin type. The formed surface type consists of sheets joined together at bent edges to form the structure. = Cloister vault = Also called domical vaults (a term sometimes also applied to sail vaults), polygonal domes, coved domes, gored domes, segmental domes (a term sometimes also used for saucer domes), paneled vaults, or pavilion vaults, these are domes that maintain a polygonal shape in their horizontal cross section. The earliest known examples date to the first century BC, such as the Tabularium of Rome from 78 BC. Others include the Baths of Antoninus in Carthage (145‚Äì160) and the Palatine Chapel at Aachen (13th ‚Äì 14th century). The most famous example is the Renaissance octagonal dome of Filippo Brunelleschi over the Florence Cathedral. Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, installed an octagonal dome above the West front of his plantation house, Monticello. = Compound dome = Also called domes on pendentives or pendentive domes (a term also applied to sail vaults), compound domes have pendentives that support a smaller diameter dome immediately above them, as in the Hagia Sophia, or a drum and dome, as in many Renaissance and post-Renaissance domes, with both forms resulting in greater height. = Crossed-arch dome = One of the earliest types of ribbed vault, the first known examples are found in the Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba in the 10th century. Rather than meeting in the center of the dome, the ribs characteristically intersect one another off-center, forming an empty polygonal space in the center. Geometry is a key element of the designs, with the octagon being perhaps the most popular shape used. Whether the arches are structural or purely decorative remains a matter of debate. The type may have an eastern origin, although the issue is also unsettled. Examples are found in Spain, North Africa, Armenia, Iran, France, and Italy. = Ellipsoidal dome = The ellipsoidal dome is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a semi-ellipse. Like other \\"rotational domes\\" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, ellipsoidal domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of \\"circular dome\\" for that reason. = Geodesic dome = Geodesic domes are the upper portion of geodesic spheres. They are composed of a framework of triangles in a polyhedron pattern. The structures are named for geodesics and are based upon geometric shapes such as icosahedrons, octahedrons or tetrahedrons. Such domes can be created using a limited number of simple elements and joints and efficiently resolve a dome's internal forces. Their efficiency is said to increase with size. Although not first invented by Buckminster Fuller, they are associated with him because he designed many geodesic domes and patented them in the United States. = Hemispherical dome = The hemispherical dome is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a semicircle. Like other \\"rotational domes\\" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, hemispherical domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of \\"circular dome\\" for that reason. They experience vertical compression along their meridians, but horizontally experience compression only in the portion above 51.8 degrees from the top. Below this point, hemispherical domes experience tension horizontally, and usually require buttressing to counteract it. According to E. Baldwin Smith, it was a shape likely known to the Assyrians, defined by Greek theoretical mathematicians, and standardized by Roman builders. = Onion dome = Bulbous domes bulge out beyond their base diameters, offering a profile greater than a hemisphere. An onion dome is a greater than hemispherical dome with a pointed top in an ogee profile. They are found in the Near East, Middle East, Persia, and India and may not have had a single point of origin. Their appearance in northern Russian architecture predates the Tatar occupation of Russia and so is not easily explained as the result of that influence. They became popular in the second half of the 15th century in the Low Countries of Northern Europe, possibly inspired by the finials of minarets in Egypt and Syria, and developed in the 16th and 17th centuries in the Netherlands before spreading to Germany, becoming a popular element of the baroque architecture of Central Europe. German bulbous domes were also influenced by Russian and Eastern European domes. The examples found in various European architectural styles are typically wooden. Examples include Kazan Church in Kolomenskoye and the Brighton Pavilion by John Nash. In Islamic architecture, they are typically made of masonry, rather than timber, with the thick and heavy bulging portion serving to buttress against the tendency of masonry domes to spread at their bases. The Taj Mahal is a famous example. = Oval dome = An oval dome is a dome of oval shape in plan, profile, or both. The term comes from the Latin ovum, meaning \\"egg\\". The earliest oval domes were used by convenience in corbelled stone huts as rounded but geometrically undefined coverings, and the first examples in Asia Minor date to around 4000 B.C. The geometry was eventually defined using combinations of circular arcs, transitioning at points of tangency. If the Romans created oval domes, it was only in exceptional circumstances. The Roman foundations of the oval plan Church of St. Gereon in Cologne point to a possible example. Domes in the Middle Ages also tended to be circular, though the church of Santo Tom√°s de las Ollas in Spain has an oval dome over its oval plan. Other examples of medieval oval domes can be found covering rectangular bays in churches. Oval plan churches became a type in the Renaissance and popular in the Baroque style. The dome built for the basilica of Vicoforte by Francesco Gallo was one of the largest and most complex ever made. Although the ellipse was known, in practice, domes of this shape were created by combining segments of circles. Popular in the 16th and 17th centuries, oval and elliptical plan domes can vary their dimensions in three axes or two axes. A sub-type with the long axis having a semicircular section is called a Murcia dome, as in the Chapel of the Junterones at Murcia Cathedral. When the short axis has a semicircular section, it is called a Melon dome. = Paraboloid dome = A paraboloid dome is a surface formed by the rotation around a vertical axis of a sector of a parabola. Like other \\"rotational domes\\" formed by the rotation of a curve around a vertical axis, paraboloid domes have circular bases and horizontal sections and are a type of \\"circular dome\\" for that reason. Because of their shape, paraboloid domes experience only compression, both radially and horizontally. = Sail dome = Also called sail vaults, handkerchief vaults, domical vaults (a term sometimes also applied to cloister vaults), pendentive domes (a term that has also been applied to compound domes), Bohemian vaults, or Byzantine domes, this type can be thought of as pendentives that, rather than merely touching each other to form a circular base for a drum or compound dome, smoothly continue their curvature to form the dome itself. The dome gives the impression of a square sail pinned down at each corner and billowing upward. These can also be thought of as saucer domes upon pendentives. Sail domes are based upon the shape of a hemisphere and are not to be confused with elliptic parabolic vaults, which appear similar but have different characteristics. In addition to semicircular sail vaults there are variations in geometry such as a low rise to span ratio or covering a rectangular plan. Sail vaults of all types have a variety of thrust conditions along their borders, which can cause problems, but have been widely used from at least the sixteenth century. The second floor of the Llotja de la Seda is covered by a series of nine meter wide sail vaults. = Saucer dome = Also called segmental domes (a term sometimes also used for cloister vaults), or calottes, these have profiles of less than half a circle. Because they reduce the portion of the dome in tension, these domes are strong but have increased radial thrust. Many of the largest existing domes are of this shape. Masonry saucer domes, because they exist entirely in compression, can be built much thinner than other dome shapes without becoming unstable. The trade-off between the proportionately increased horizontal thrust at their abutments and their decreased weight and quantity of materials may make them more economical, but they are more vulnerable to damage from movement in their supports. = Umbrella dome = Also called gadrooned, fluted, organ-piped, pumpkin, melon, ribbed, parachute, scalloped, or lobed domes, these are a type of dome divided at the base into curved segments, which follow the curve of the elevation. \\"Fluted\\" may refer specifically to this pattern as an external feature, such as was common in Mamluk Egypt. The \\"ribs\\" of a dome are the radial lines of masonry that extend from the crown down to the springing. The central dome of the Hagia Sophia uses the ribbed method, which accommodates a ring of windows between the ribs at the base of the dome. The central dome of St. Peter's Basilica also uses this method.  History = Early history and simple domes = Apache wigwam, by Edward S. Curtis, 1903 Cultures from pre-history to modern times constructed domed dwellings using local materials. Although it is not known when the first dome was created, sporadic examples of early domed structures have been discovered. The earliest discovered may be four small dwellings made of Mammoth tusks and bones. The first was found by a farmer in Mezhirich, Ukraine, in 1965 while he was digging in his cellar and archaeologists unearthed three more. They date from 19,280 ‚Äì 11,700 BC. In modern times, the creation of relatively simple dome-like structures has been documented among various indigenous peoples around the world. The wigwam was made by Native Americans using arched branches or poles covered with grass or hides. The Ef√© people of central Africa construct similar structures, using leaves as shingles. Another example is the igloo, a shelter built from blocks of compact snow and used by the Inuit people, among others. The Himba people of Namibia construct \\"desert igloos\\" of wattle and daub for use as temporary shelters at seasonal cattle camps, and as permanent homes by the poor. Extraordinarily thin domes of sun-baked clay 20 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, and nearly parabolic in curve, are known from Cameroon. The historical development from structures like these to more sophisticated domes is not well documented. That the dome was known to early Mesopotamia may explain the existence of domes in both China and the West in the first millennium BC. Another explanation, however, is that the use of the dome shape in construction did not have a single point of origin and was common in virtually all cultures long before domes were constructed with enduring materials. Corbelled stone domes have been found from the Neolithic period in the ancient Near East, and in the Middle East to Western Europe from antiquity. The kings of Achaemenid Persia held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. Simple domical mausoleums existed in the Hellenistic period. The remains of a large domed circular hall in the Parthian capital city of Nyssa has been dated to perhaps the first century AD, showing \\"...the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them.\\" It likely had a wooden dome. = Persian domes = Sheikh Lotfallah Mosque, Isfahan, Iran. Persian architecture likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome- building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes. Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the Iranian plateau and Greater Iran, domes were an important part of vernacular architecture throughout Persian history. The Persian invention of the squinch, a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome in a way reliable enough for large constructions and domes moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result. Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods. The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century. The Samanid Mausoleum in Transoxiana dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century. The Seljuk Empire's notables built tomb-towers, called \\"Turkish Triangles\\", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi- circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous. The domed enclosure of the Jameh Mosque of Isfahan, built in 1086-7 by Nizam al-Mulk, was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 TƒÅj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks. Beginning in the Ilkhanate, Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. The construction of tomb towers decreased. The 7.5 meter wide double dome of Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum (1351‚Äì1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period. The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors. The domes of the Safavid dynasty (1501‚Äì1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns, and they were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the Mughal architecture of India. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the Shah Cheragh (1852‚Äì1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, and domed cisterns and icehouses remain common sights in the countryside. = Chinese domes = Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb (25 AD ‚Äì 220 AD). Very little has survived of ancient Chinese architecture, due to the extensive use of timber as a building material. Brick and stone vaults used in tomb construction have survived, and the corbeled dome was used, rarely, in tombs and temples. The earliest true domes found in Chinese tombs were shallow cloister vaults, called simian jieding, derived from the Han use of barrel vaulting. Unlike the cloister vaults of western Europe, the corners are rounded off as they rise. The first known example is a brick tomb dating from the end of the Western Han period, near the modern city of Xiangcheng in Henan Province. These four-sided domes used small interlocking bricks and enabled a square space near the entrance of a tomb large enough for several people that may have been used for funeral ceremonies. The interlocking brick technique was rapidly adopted and four-sided domes became widespread outside Henan by the end of the first century AD. A model of a tomb found with a shallow true dome from the late Han Dynasty (206 BC ‚Äì 220 AD) can be seen at the Guangzhou Museum (Canton). Another, the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb, found in Hong Kong in 1955, has a design common among Eastern Han Dynasty (25 AD ‚Äì 220 AD) tombs in South China: a barrel vaulted entrance leading to a domed front hall with barrel vaulted chambers branching from it in a cross shape. It is the only such tomb that has been found in Hong Kong and is exhibited as part of the Hong Kong Museum of History. During the Three Kingdoms period (220‚Äì280), the \\"cross-joint dome\\" (siyuxuanjinshi) was developed under the Wu and Western Jin dynasties south of the Yangtze River, with arcs building out from the corners of a square room until they met and joined at the center. These domes were stronger, had a steeped angle, and could cover larger areas than the relatively shallow cloister vaults. Over time, they were made taller and wider. There were also corbel vaults, called diese, although these are the weakest type. Some tombs of the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279) have beehive domes. = Roman and Byzantine domes = Painting by Giovanni Paolo Pannini of the Pantheon in Rome. Roman domes are found in baths, villas, palaces, and tombs. Oculi are common features. They are customarily hemispherical in shape and partially or totally concealed on the exterior. To buttress the horizontal thrusts of a large hemispherical masonry dome, the supporting walls were built up beyond the base to at least the haunches of the dome, and the dome was then also sometimes covered with a conical or polygonal roof. Domes reached monumental size in the Roman Imperial period. Roman baths played a leading role in the development of domed construction in general, and monumental domes in particular. Modest domes in baths dating from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC are seen in Pompeii, in the cold rooms of the Terme Stabiane and the Terme del Foro. However, the extensive use of domes did not occur before the 1st century AD. The growth of domed construction increases under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally-planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. The Pantheon, a temple in Rome completed by Emperor Hadrian as part of the Baths of Agrippa, is the most famous, best preserved, and largest Roman dome. Segmented domes, made of radially concave wedges or of alternating concave and flat wedges, appear under Hadrian in the 2nd century and most preserved examples of this style date from this period. In the 3rd century, Imperial mausoleums began to be built as domed rotundas, rather than as tumulus structures or other types, following similar monuments by private citizens. The technique of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy in the late third and early fourth centuries. In the 4th century, Roman domes proliferated due to changes in the way domes were constructed, including advances in centering techniques and the use of brick ribbing. The material of choice in construction gradually transitioned during the 4th and 5th centuries from stone or concrete to lighter brick in thin shells. Baptisteries began to be built in the manner of domed mausoleums during the 4th century in Italy. The octagonal Lateran baptistery or the baptistery of the Holy Sepulchre may have been the first, and the style spread during the 5th century. By the 5th century, structures with small-scale domed cross plans existed across the Christian world. With the end of the Western Roman Empire, domes became a signature feature of the church architecture of the surviving Eastern Roman ‚Äî or \\"Byzantine\\" ‚Äî Empire. 6th-century church building by the Emperor Justinian used the domed cross unit on a monumental scale, and his architects made the domed brick-vaulted central plan standard throughout the Roman east. This divergence with the Roman west from the second third of the 6th century may be considered the beginning of a \\"Byzantine\\" architecture. Justinian's Hagia Sophia was an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. \\"Cross-domed units\\", a more secure structural system created by bracing a dome on all four sides with broad arches, became a standard element on a smaller scale in later Byzantine church architecture. The Cross-in-square plan, with a single dome at the crossing or five domes in a quincunx pattern, became widely popular in the Middle Byzantine period (c. 843‚Äì1204). It is the most common church plan from the tenth century until the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Resting domes on circular or polygonal drums pierced with windows eventually became the standard style, with regional characteristics. In the Byzantine period, domes were normally hemispherical and had, with occasional exceptions, windowed drums. All of the surviving examples in Constantinople are ribbed or pumpkin domes, with the divisions corresponding to the number of windows. Roofing for domes ranged from simple ceramic tile to more expensive, more durable, and more form-fitting lead sheeting. Metal clamps between stone cornice blocks, metal tie rods, and metal chains were also used to stabilize domed construction. The technique of using double shells for domes, although revived in the Renaissance, originated in Byzantine practice. = Arabic and Western European domes = The Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem The Syria and Palestine area has a long tradition of domical architecture, including wooden domes in shapes described as \\"conoid\\", or similar to pine cones. When the Arab Muslim forces conquered the region, they employed local craftsmen for their buildings and, by the end of the 7th century, the dome had begun to become an architectural symbol of Islam. In addition to religious shrines, such as the Dome of the Rock, domes were used over the audience and throne halls of Umayyad palaces, and as part of porches, pavilions, fountains, towers and the calderia of baths. Blending the architectural features of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, the domes used both pendentives and squinches and were made in a variety of shapes and materials. Although architecture in the region would decline following the movement of the capital to Iraq under the Abbasids in 750, mosques built after a revival in the late 11th century usually followed the Umayyad model. Early versions of bulbous domes can be seen in mosaic illustrations in Syria dating to the Umayyad period. They were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century. Italian church architecture from the late sixth century to the end of the eighth century was influenced less by the trends of Constantinople than by a variety of Byzantine provincial plans. With the crowning of Charlemagne as a new Roman Emperor, Byzantine influences were largely replaced in a revival of earlier Western building traditions. Occasional exceptions include examples of early quincunx churches at Milan and near Cassino. Another is the Palatine Chapel. Its domed octagon design was influenced by Byzantine models. It was the largest dome north of the Alps at that time. Venice, Southern Italy and Sicily served as outposts of Middle Byzantine architectural influence in Italy. The Great Mosque of C√≥rdoba contains the first known examples of the crossed-arch dome type. The use of corner squinches to support domes was widespread in Islamic architecture by the 10th and 11th centuries. After the ninth century, mosques in North Africa often have a small decorative dome over the mihrab. Additional domes are sometimes used at the corners of the mihrab wall, at the entrance bay, or on the square tower minarets. Egypt, along with north-eastern Iran, was one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic mausoleums, beginning in the 10th century. Fatimid mausoleums were mostly simple square buildings covered by a dome. Domes were smooth or ribbed and had a characteristic Fatimid \\"keel\\" shape profile. Domes in Romanesque architecture are generally found within crossing towers at the intersection of a church's nave and transept, which conceal the domes externally. They are typically octagonal in plan and use corner squinches to translate a square bay into a suitable octagonal base. They appear \\"in connection with basilicas almost throughout Europe\\" between 1050 and 1100. The Crusades, beginning in 1095, also appear to have influenced domed architecture in Western Europe, particularly in the areas around the Mediterranean Sea. The Knights Templar, headquartered at the site, built a series of centrally planned churches throughout Europe modeled on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, with the Dome of the Rock also an influence. In southwest France, there are over 250 domed Romanesque churches in the P√©rigord region alone. The use of pendentives to support domes in the Aquitaine region, rather than the squinches more typical of western medieval architecture, strongly implies a Byzantine influence. Gothic domes are uncommon due to the use of rib vaults over naves, and with church crossings usually focused instead by a tall steeple, but there are examples of small octagonal crossing domes in cathedrals as the style developed from the Romanesque. Star-shaped domes found at the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, the Hall of the Abencerrajes (c. 1333‚Äì91) and the Hall of the two Sisters (c. 1333‚Äì54), are extraordinarily developed examples of muqarnas domes. In the first half of the fourteenth century, stone blocks replaced bricks as the primary building material in the dome construction of Mamluk Egypt and, over the course of 250 years, around 400 domes were built in Cairo to cover the tombs of Mamluk sultans and emirs. Dome profiles were varied, with \\"keel-shaped\\", bulbous, ogee, stilted domes, and others being used. On the drum, angles were chamfered, or sometimes stepped, externally and triple windows were used in a tri-lobed arrangement on the faces. Bulbous cupolas on minarets were used in Egypt beginning around 1330, spreading to Syria in the following century. In the fifteenth century, pilgrimages to and flourishing trade relations with the Near East exposed the Low Countries of northwest Europe to the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of the Orient and such domes apparently became associated with the city of Jerusalem. Multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century. = Russian domes = Gilded onion domes of the Cathedral of the Annunciation, Moscow Kremlin. The multidomed church is a typical form of Russian church architecture that distinguishes Russia from other Orthodox nations and Christian denominations. Indeed, the earliest Russian churches, built just after the Christianization of Kievan Rus', were multi-domed, which has led some historians to speculate about how Russian pre-Christian pagan temples might have looked. Examples of these early churches are the 13-domed wooden Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod (989) and the 25-domed stone Desyatinnaya Church in Kiev (989‚Äì996). The number of domes typically has a symbolical meaning in Russian architecture, for example 13 domes symbolize Christ with 12 Apostles, while 25 domes means the same with an additional 12 Prophets of the Old Testament. The multiple domes of Russian churches were often comparatively smaller than Byzantine domes. Saint Basil's Cathedral (1555‚Äì61) in Moscow, Russia. Its distinctive onion domes date to the 1680s. Plentiful timber in Russia made wooden domes common and at least partially contributed to the popularity of onion domes, which were easier to shape in wood than in masonry. The earliest stone churches in Russia featured Byzantine style domes, however by the Early Modern era the onion dome had become the predominant form in traditional Russian architecture. The onion dome is a dome whose shape resembles an onion, after which they are named. Such domes are often larger in diameter than the drums they sit on, and their height usually exceeds their width. The whole bulbous structure tapers smoothly to a point. Though the earliest preserved Russian domes of such type date from the 16th century, illustrations from older chronicles indicate they have existed since the late 13th century. Like tented roofs‚Äîwhich were combined with, and sometimes replaced domes in Russian architecture since the 16th century‚Äîonion domes initially were used only in wooden churches. Builders introduced them into stone architecture much later, and continued to make their carcasses of either of wood or metal on top of masonry drums. Russian domes are often gilded or brightly painted. A dangerous technique of chemical gilding using mercury had been applied on some occasions until the mid-19th century, most notably in the giant dome of Saint Isaac's Cathedral. The more modern and safe method of gold electroplating was applied for the first time in gilding the domes of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, the tallest Eastern Orthodox church in the world. = Ottoman domes = Selimiye Mosque dome in Edirne, Turkey The rise of the Ottoman Empire and its spread in Asia Minor and the Balkans coincided with the decline of the Seljuk Turks and the Byzantine Empire. Early Ottoman buildings, for almost two centuries after 1300, were characterized by a blending of Ottoman culture and indigenous architecture, and the pendentive dome was used throughout the empire. The Byzantine dome form was adopted and further developed. Ottoman architecture made exclusive use of the semi-spherical dome for vaulting over even very small spaces, influenced by the earlier traditions of both Byzantine Anatolia and Central Asia. The smaller the structure, the simpler the plan, but mosques of medium size were also covered by single domes. The earliest Ottoman mosques were single oblong rooms with either simple tiled pitched roofs of wood or a wooden interior dome. Most of these wooden domes have been lost to fires and replaced by flat ceilings. The earliest masonry domes covered square single room mosques, the archetype of Ottoman architecture. Examples include the Mosque of Orhan Gazi in Gebze and Karag√∂z Bey Mosque in Mostar. This domed- square unit is the defining element of the three basic Ottoman mosque plans: the single unit mosque, multi-unit mosque, and eyvan (or \\"iwan\\") mosque. The multi-unit mosque uses several domed-squares of similar size along the length of a mosque, or across its width, or both, with the central dome sometimes larger than the others. A style common in the Bursa period, and known as the \\"Bursa type\\", is like a duplication of the single-domed square, with one long space divided by an arch into two square bays that are each covered by a dome. A variation of this type has the room covered by one dome and one semi-dome, with additional side chambers. A multi-domed style derived from Seljuk architecture is that of the Ulu Camii, or Great Mosque, which consists of a number of domes of the same size supported by pillars. The eyvan mosque type (the eyvan being derived from Seljuk architecture) uses domed-square units in a variety of sizes, heights, and details, with only the possible pair of side units being similar sizes. Early experiments with large domes include the domed square mosques of √áine and Mudurnu under Bayezid I, and the later domed \\"zawiya-mosques\\" at Bursa. The √ú√ß ≈ûerefeli Mosque at Edirne developed the idea of the central dome being a larger version of the domed modules used throughout the rest of the structure to generate open space. This idea became important to the Ottoman style as it developed. The Beyazidiye Mosque (1501‚Äì1506) in Istanbul begins the Classical period in Ottoman architecture, in which the great Imperial Mosques, with variations, resemble the former Byzantine basilica of Hagia Sophia in having a large central dome with semi- domes of the same span to the east and west. Hagia Sophia's central dome arrangement is faithfully reproduced in three Ottoman mosques in Istanbul: the Beyazidiye Mosque, the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha Mosque, and the S√ºleymaniye Mosque. Three other Imperial mosques in Istanbul also add semi-domes to the north and south, doing away with the basilica plan: ≈ûehzade Camii, Sultan Ahmed I Camii, and Yeni Cami. The peak of this classical period, which lasted into the 17th century, came with the architecture of Mimar Sinan. In addition to large Imperial mosques, he produced hundreds of other monuments, including medium- sized mosques such as the Mihrimah, Sokollu, and R√ºstem Pasha Mosque and the tomb of Suleiman the Magnificent. S√ºleymaniye Mosque, built in Constantinople (modern Istanbul) from 1550 to 1557, has a main dome 53 meters high with a diameter of 26.5 meters. At the time it was built, the dome was the highest in the Ottoman Empire when measured from sea level, but lower from the floor of the building and smaller in diameter than that of the nearby Hagia Sophia. Another Classical domed mosque type is, like the Byzantine church of Sergius and Bacchus, the domed polygon within a square. Octagons and hexagons were common, such as those of √ú√ß ≈ûerefeli Mosque (1437‚Äì1447) and Selimiye Mosque in Edirne. The Selimiye Mosque was the first structure built by the Ottomans that had a larger dome than that of the Hagia Sophia. The dome rises above a square bay. Corner semi-domes convert this into an octagon, which muqarnas transition to a circular base. The dome has an average internal diameter of about 31.5 meters, while that of Hagia Sophia averages 31.3 meters. Designed and built by architect Mimar Sinan between 1568 and 1574, when he finished it he was 86 years old, and he considered the mosque his masterpiece. The first large Imperial Mosque of Istanbul in the imported Baroque style was the Nuruosmaniye Mosque (1748‚Äì1755). One of the finest was the Laleli Mosque of 1759‚Äì1764. = Italian Renaissance domes = The Cathedral of Florence with Brunelleschi's dome, Italy Filippo Brunelleschi's octagonal brick domical vault over Florence Cathedral was built between 1420 and 1436 and the lantern surmounting the dome was completed in 1467. The dome is 42 meters wide and made of two shells. The dome is not itself Renaissance in style, although the lantern is closer. A combination of dome, drum, pendentives, and barrel vaults developed as the characteristic structural forms of large Renaissance churches following a period of innovation in the later fifteenth century. Florence was the first Italian city to develop the new style, followed by Rome and then Venice. Brunelleschi's domes at San Lorenzo and the Pazzi Chapel established them as a key element of Renaissance architecture. His plan for the dome of the Pazzi Chapel in Florence's Basilica of Santa Croce (1430‚Äì52) illustrates the Renaissance enthusiasm for geometry and for the circle as geometry's supreme form. This emphasis on geometric essentials would be very influential. De re aedificatoria, written by Leon Battista Alberti around 1452, recommends vaults with coffering for churches, as in the Pantheon, and the first design for a dome at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome is usually attributed to him, although the recorded architect is Bernardo Rossellino. This would culminate in Bramante's 1505‚Äì06 projects for a wholly new St. Peter's Basilica, marking the beginning of the displacement of the Gothic ribbed vault with the combination of dome and barrel vault, which proceeded throughout the sixteenth century. Bramante's initial design was for a Greek cross plan with a large central hemispherical dome and four smaller domes around it in a quincunx pattern. Work began in 1506 and continued under a succession of builders over the next 120 years. The dome was completed by Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana. The publication of Sebastiano Serlio's treatise, one of the most popular architectural treatises ever published, was responsible for the spread of the oval in late Renaissance and Baroque architecture throughout Italy, Spain, France, and central Europe. The Villa Capra, also known as \\"La Rotunda\\", was built by Andrea Palladio from 1565 to 1569 near Vicenza. Its highly symmetrical square plan centers on a circular room covered by a dome, and it proved highly influential on the Georgian architects of 18th century England, architects in Russia, and architects in America, Thomas Jefferson among them. Palladio's two domed churches in Venice are San Giorgio Maggiore (1565‚Äì1610) and Il Redentore (1577‚Äì92), the latter built in thanksgiving for the end of a bad outbreak of plague in the city. The spread of the Renaissance-style dome outside of Italy began with central Europe, although there was often a stylistic delay of a century or two. = South Asian domes = The Taj Mahal in Agra, India built by Shah Jahan. Islamic rule over northern and central India brought with it the use of domes constructed with stone, brick and mortar, and iron dowels and cramps. Centering was made from timber and bamboo. The use of iron cramps to join together adjacent stones was known in pre- Islamic India, and was used at the base of domes for hoop reinforcement. The synthesis of styles created by this introduction of new forms to the Hindu tradition of trabeate construction created a distinctive architecture. Domes in pre-Mughal India have a standard squat circular shape with a lotus design and bulbous finial at the top, derived from Hindu architecture. Because the Hindu architectural tradition did not include arches, flat corbels were used to transition from the corners of the room to the dome, rather than squinches. In contrast to Persian and Ottoman domes, the domes of Indian tombs tend to be more bulbous. The earliest examples include the half-domes of the late 13th century tomb of Balban and the small dome of the tomb of Khan Shahid, which were made of roughly cut material and would have needed covering surface finishes. Under the Lodi dynasty there was a large proliferation of tomb building, with octagonal plans reserved for royalty and square plans used for others of high rank, and the first double dome was introduced to India in this period. The first major Mughal building is the domed tomb of Humayun, built between 1562 and 1571 by a Persian architect. The central double dome covers an octagonal central chamber about 15 meters wide and is accompanied by small domed chattri made of brick and faced with stone. Chatris, the domed kiosks on pillars characteristic of Mughal roofs, were adopted from their Hindu use as cenotaphs. The fusion of Persian and Indian architecture can be seen in the dome shape of the Taj Mahal: the bulbous shape derives from Persian Timurid domes, and the finial with lotus leaf base is derived from Hindu temples. The Gol Gumbaz, or Round Dome, is one of the largest masonry domes in the world. It has an internal diameter of 41.15 meters and a height of 54.25 meters. The dome was the most technically advanced built in the Deccan. The last major Islamic tomb built in India was the tomb of Safdar Jang (1753‚Äì54). The central dome is reportedly triple-shelled, with two relatively flat inner brick domes and an outer bulbous marble dome, although it may actually be that the marble and second brick domes are joined everywhere but under the lotus leaf finial at the top. = Early modern period domes = The dome of St Paul's Cathedral in London In the early sixteenth century, the lantern of the Italian dome spread to Germany, gradually adopting the bulbous cupola from the Netherlands. Russian architecture strongly influenced the many bulbous domes of the wooden churches of Bohemia and Silesia and, in Bavaria, bulbous domes less resemble Dutch models than Russian ones. Domes like these gained in popularity in central and southern Germany and in Austria in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly in the Baroque style, and influenced many bulbous cupolas in Poland and Eastern Europe in the Baroque period. However, many bulbous domes in eastern Europe were replaced over time in the larger cities during the second half of the eighteenth century in favor of hemispherical or stilted cupolas in the French or Italian styles. The construction of domes in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries relied primarily on empirical techniques and oral traditions rather than the architectural treatises of the times, which avoided practical details. This was adequate for domes up to medium size, with diameters in the range of 12 to 20 meters. Materials were considered homogeneous and rigid, with compression taken into account and elasticity ignored. The weight of materials and the size of the dome were the key references. Lateral tensions in a dome were counteracted with horizontal rings of iron, stone, or wood incorporated into the structure. Over the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, developments in mathematics and the study of statics led to a more precise formalization of the ideas of the traditional constructive practices of arches and vaults, and there was a diffusion of studies on the most stable form for these structures: the catenary curve. Robert Hooke, who first articulated that a catenary arch was comparable to an inverted hanging chain, may have advised Wren on how to achieve the crossing dome of St. Paul's Cathedral. Wren's structural system became the standard for large domes well into the 19th century. The ribs in Guarino Guarini's San Lorenzo and Il Sidone were shaped as catenary arches. The idea of a large oculus in a solid dome revealing a second dome originated with him. He also established the oval dome as a reconciliation of the longitudinal plan church favored by the liturgy of the Counter-Reformation and the centralized plan favored by idealists. Because of the imprecision of oval domes in the Rococo period, drums were problematic and the domes instead often rested directly on arches or pendentives. In the eighteenth century, the study of dome structures changed radically, with domes being considered as a composition of smaller elements, each subject to mathematical and mechanical laws and easier to analyse individually, rather than being considered as whole units unto themselves. Although never very popular in domestic settings, domes were used in a number of 18th century homes built in the Neo-Classical style. In the United States, most public buildings in the late 18th century were only distinguishable from private residences because they featured cupolas. = Modern period domes = Geodesic domes of the Eden Project in United Kingdom Saint Sava was entirely build from prefabricated slabs. It was hydraulically lifted from the ground to 40 m height by lift-slab method. 1935-2004 The historicism of the 19th century led to many domes being re-translations of the great domes of the past, rather than further stylistic developments, especially in sacred architecture. New production techniques allowed for cast iron and wrought iron to be produced both in larger quantities and at relatively low prices during the Industrial Revolution. Russia, which had large supplies of iron, has some of the earliest examples of iron's architectural use. Excluding those that simply imitated multi-shell masonry, metal framed domes such as the elliptical dome of Royal Albert Hall in London (57 to 67 meters in diameter) and the circular dome of the Halle au Bl√© in Paris may represent the century's chief development of the simple domed form. Cast-iron domes were particularly popular in France. The practice of building rotating domes for housing large telescopes was begun in the 19th century, with early examples using papier-m√¢ch√© to minimize weight. Unique glass domes springing straight from ground level were used for hothouses and winter gardens. Elaborate covered shopping arcades included large glazed domes at their cross intersections. The large domes of the 19th century included exhibition buildings and functional structures such as gasometers and locomotive sheds. The \\"first fully triangulated framed dome\\" was built in Berlin in 1863 by Johann Wilhelm Schwedler and, by the start of the 20th century, similarly triangulated frame domes had become fairly common. Vladimir Shukhov was also an early pioneer of what would later be called gridshell structures and in 1897 he employed them in domed exhibit pavilions at the All- Russia Industrial and Art Exhibition. Domes built with steel and concrete were able to achieve very large spans. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Guastavino family, a father and son team who worked on the eastern seaboard of the United States, further developed the masonry dome, using tiles set flat against the surface of the curve and fast-setting Portland cement, which allowed mild steel bar to be used to counteract tension forces. The thin domical shell was further developed with the construction by Walther Bauersfeld of two planetarium domes in Jena, Germany in the early 1920s. They consisting of a triangulated frame of light steel bars and mesh covered by a thin layer of concrete. These are generally taken to be the first modern architectural thin shells. These are also considered the first geodesic domes. Geodesic domes have been used for radar enclosures, greenhouses, housing, and weather stations. Architectural shells had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s, peaking in popularity shortly before the widespread adoption of computers and the finite element method of structural analysis. The first permanent air supported membrane domes were the radar domes designed and built by Walter Bird after World War II. Their low cost eventually led to the development of permanent versions using teflon-coated fiberglass and by 1985 the majority of the domed stadiums around the world used this system. Tensegrity domes, patented by Buckminster Fuller in 1962, are membrane structures consisting of radial trusses made from steel cables under tension with vertical steel pipes spreading the cables into the truss form. They have been made circular, elliptical, and other shapes to cover stadiums from Korea to Florida. Tension membrane design has depended upon computers, and the increasing availability of powerful computers resulted in many developments being made in the last three decades of the 20th century. The higher expense of rigid large span domes made them relatively rare, although rigidly moving panels is the most popular system for sports stadiums with retractable roofing.

It now hosts around fifty artists and stages art exhibitions open to the public. History Located in the Passage Dantzig, in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, La Ruche is an old three-storey circular structure that got its name because it looked more like a large beehive than a dwelling for humans. Originally a temporary building designed by Gustave Eiffel for use as a wine rotunda at the Great Exposition of 1900, the structure was dismantled and re-erected as low-cost studios for artists by Alfred Boucher (1850‚Äì1934), a sculptor, who wanted to help young artists by providing them with shared models and an exhibition space open to all residents. As well as to artists, La Ruche became a home to an array of drunks, misfits, drifters and people that just needed a place to stay.Jeanine Warnod, Les Artistes de Montparnasse: La Ruche, Paris et Saint-Ouen, Van Wilder, 1988, Dominique Paulv√©, Fran√ßois Goudier, La Ruche : Un si√®cle d'art √† Paris, Paris, Gr√ºnd, 2002, At La Ruche the rent was cheap; and no one was evicted for non-payment. When hungry, many would wander over to artist Marie Vassilieff's soup kitchen (more genteelly called her cantine) for a meal and conversation with fellow starving artists. The Russian painter Pinchus Kremegne got off the train at the Gare de l'Est with three rubles in his pocket. The only words in French he knew was the phrase \\"Passage Dantzig\\"; but that was all he needed to get him there. Artists Like Montmartre, few places have ever housed such artistic talent as found at La Ruche.

When he was nine, the family moved to Harrow, London, where he attended Willesden County School and Pinner County Grammar School, in Middlesex. From there he went on to study the trumpet in London at the Guildhall School of Music. Whilst working as a copyist, he formed his own orchestra in his spare time and began arranging and conducting recordings for over fifty artists, which resulted in more than 100 chart successes. He wrote his first feature film score for Whirlpool, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM-British Studios in 1959, Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios. In the 1980s Goodwin began concentrating on live orchestral performances and appeared as guest conductor with many symphony orchestras at home and abroad including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. Biography=Early life= Goodwin was born in Plymouth to James Goodwin (died 1952), a policeman with the Metropolitan Police Force and Bessie Violet Goodwin n√©e Godsland (died 1966). The family originally came from London, but had moved to Devon due to James being assigned to security work at the naval dockyardLamb, Andrew, Goodwin, Ron, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, online edition, 30 December 2011 in Devonport. Goodwin learned to play the piano by the age of five and returned to London four years later, where he attended Willesden County Grammar School. Whilst there, he learnt to play the trumpet and performed regularly in the school band. Upon the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to Harrow, Middlesex, and Goodwin attended Pinner County Grammar School. It was here that he formed his own band ‚Äì Ron Goodwin and the Woodchoppers. He later studied the trumpet in London at the Guildhall School of Music. = Early career = In 1943, after a brief spell as an insurance clerk, Goodwin joined Campbell, Connelly and Company, a music publisher. His job was a copyist and arranger and went on to work in that role for the BBC. He entered the world of movie music through documentary films, which he said was \\"a very good training\\". He worked as a ghostwriter for Phil Green, Stanley Black, Geraldo and Peter Yorke among others. From 1949, Goodwin conducted for the Polygon company, arranging and conducting recordings of Petula Clark and Jimmy Young, including the latter's 1951 UK no 1 hit \\"Too Young\\". In the 1950s he joined Parlophone, and worked alongside George Martin. He accompanied Peter Sellers on his Goodness Gracious Me album, and began to broadcast and make records with his Ron Goodwin Concert Orchestra. In 1953, Goodwin began arranging and conducting more than 300 recordings for over fifty artists, which resulted in more than 100 chart successes. He simultaneously made his own series of recordings and broadcasts as Ron Goodwin and his Concert Orchestra, and, in addition, began to compose scores for documentary films at Merton Park Studios. In 1958, Goodwin wrote his first feature film score for Whirlpool, with screenplay by Lawrence P. Bachmann. After Bachmann became executive producer at MGM British Studios in 1959, Goodwin composed and conducted the music for most of its productions, as well as working for other film studios. His singles work included recordings with jazz and calypso singer Frank Holder. =Works= Goodwin is primarily known for his film music and worked on more than 70 scores during his career. He composed his first feature film, Man with a Gun in 1958 and was quickly followed by The Witness and Whirlpool a year later. Early minor film success followed with several films until 1961 when he composed scores for the first of four Miss Marple films starring Margaret Rutherford, entitled Murder, She Said (1961). He later went on to compose for the remaining three Miss Marple films Murder at the Gallop (1963), Murder Most Foul (1963) and Murder Ahoy (1964). He scored two horror films, Village of the Damned (1960) and its sequel Children of the Damned (1964). His music for war films is particularly well remembered. This includes work on 633 Squadron (1964), Operation Crossbow (1965), Where Eagles Dare (1968), Battle of Britain (1969), for which he (mostly) replaced William Walton, plus Force Ten from Navarone (1978). After requests from the Band of the Royal Air Force, the opening from Battle of Britain, originally titled Luftwaffe March, was retitled Aces High and is now regularly played by military bands in the UK. He wrote the scores for Of Human Bondage (1964), Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy (1972, replacing Henry Mancini), two movies featuring Morecambe and Wise, and the Norman Wisdom film, The Early Bird (1965). Goodwin's score for the 1966 film The Trap is now used by the BBC as the theme to the London Marathon coverage. A 30-second variation of his 1969 composition for the film Monte Carlo or Bust is used as the intro for the BBC Radio Four panel game I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Goodwin wrote several Disney film scores during the 1970s, including the one used for One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing (1975). He also composed the music and lyrics for a series of animated films. These included The Selfish Giant (1971), The Happy Prince (1974), and The Little Mermaid (also 1974). Goodwin's last film score was for the Danish- made animation film Valhalla in 1986. He composed the Yorkshire Television start up music used from their launch in July 1968 to the early 1980s, before ITV had breakfast television. Goodwin wrote the television advertising jingles such as Noddy's chant, \\"I like Ricicles: they're twicicle as nicicles\\", and the \\"Mr Sheen shines umpteen things clean\\" song, inspired by Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines. =Later career= By 1987, Goodwin had begun concentrating on live orchestrations which included his \\"Drake 400 Suite\\" in 1980 and \\"Armada Suite\\" in 1988. His \\"New Zealand Suite\\" in 1983 marked a long association with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Goodwin appeared as guest conductor with many symphony orchestras at home and abroad including the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Hall√© Orchestra, Royal Scottish National Orchestra, Ulster Orchestra, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, Singapore Symphony Orchestra, Australian Pops Orchestra, Danish Radio Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra. Goodwin was guest conductor at the Royal Academy of Music's Festival of British and American Film Music in June 1996. =Awards= In 1972, he recorded Somebody Named Ron Goodwin Plays Somebody Named Burt Bacharach and recorded internationally, winning gold and platinum discs awarded by EMI. He won a platinum disc from EMI New Zealand to mark two million sales of the album \\"Going Places\\". During his career he won three Ivor Novello Awards, including a lifetime achievement award, and was a Fellow of the City of Leeds College of Music and a Freeman of the City of London. Goodwin was nominated for the Golden Globe award for best original score for the movie Frenzy (1972). Personal life Goodwin was married twice and had a son, Chris, from his first marriage. Ron Shillingford, Goodwin's personal assistant for over twenty years, said of him: \\"Ron was a musical perfectionist who had a fine rapport with his fellow artists. He was a kind, caring man, with a wonderful sense of humour.\\" Goodwin was enthusiastic about working with young people and was heavily involved with the Hampshire County Youth Orchestra, Worthing Youth Orchestra, City of Leeds College of Music and the City of Birmingham Schools' Concert Orchestra. The road in which Goodwin lived with his family in Plymouth has since been renamed Goodwin Crescent in his memory. =Death= In December 2002, Goodwin completed his 32nd consecutive year of Christmas concerts in packed venues across the South of England. However, he had suffered from asthma for many years and the condition had worsened with age. On 7 January 2003, having completed conducting a series of Christmas concerts with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, he returned home and died in his sleep at Blacknest Cottage, Brimpton Common, Berkshire, on 8 January 2003, aged 77. He is buried at St Paul's Churchyard, Ashford Hill, Kingsclere, Hampshire, England.

The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture. A vineyard is often characterised by its terroir, a French term loosely translating as \\"a sense of place\\" that refers to the specific geographical and geological characteristics of grapevine plantations, which may be imparted in the wine. History Satyrs in vineyard. Attic red-figure volute-krater, ca. 490 BC, State Collections of Antiques in Munich. The earliest evidence of wine production dates from between 6000 and 5000 BC. Wine making technology improved considerably with the ancient Greeks but it wasn't until the end of the Roman Empire that cultivation techniques as we know them were common throughout Europe. In medieval Europe the Church was a staunch supporter of wine, which was necessary for the celebration of the Mass. During the lengthy instability of the Middle Ages, the monasteries maintained and developed viticultural practices, having the resources, security, stability and interest in improving the quality of their vines. They owned and tended the best vineyards in Europe and vinum theologium was considered superior to all others. European vineyards were planted with a wide variety of the Vitis vinifera grape. However, in the late 19th century, the entire species was nearly destroyed by the plant louse phylloxera accidentally introduced to Europe from North America. Native American grapevines include varieties such as Vitis labrusca, which is resistant to the bug. Vitis vinifera varieties were saved by being grafted onto the rootstock of Native American varieties, although there is still no remedy for phylloxera, which remains a danger to any vineyard not planted with grafted rootstock.  Modern practices  A vineyard with bird-netting thumbleft Napa Valley vineyard on the side of a road The quest for vineyard efficiency has produced a bewildering range of systems and techniques in recent years. Due to the often much more fertile New World growing conditions, attention has focussed heavily on managing the vine's more vigorous growth. Innovation in palissage (training of the vine, usually along a trellis, and often referred to as \\"canopy management\\") and pruning and thinning methods (which aim to optimize the Leaf Area/Fruit (LA/F) ratio relative to a vineyard's microclimate) have largely replaced more general, traditional concepts like \\"yield per unit area\\" in favor of \\"maximizing yield of desired quality\\". Many of these new techniques have since been adopted in place of traditional practice in the more progressive of the so-called \\"Old World\\" vineyards. Other recent practices include spraying water on vines to protect them from sub-zero temperatures (aspersion), new grafting techniques, soil slotting, and mechanical harvesting. Such techniques have made possible the development of wine industries in New World countries such as Canada. Today there is increasing interest in developing organic, ecologically sensitive and sustainable vineyards. Biodynamics has become increasingly popular in viticulture. The use of drip irrigation in recent years has expanded vineyards into areas which were previously unplantable. For well over half a century, Cornell University, the University of California, Davis, and California State University, Fresno, among others, have been conducting scientific experiments to improve viticulture and educate practitioners. The research includes developing improved grape varieties and investigating pest control. The International Grape Genome Program is a multi-national effort to discover a genetic means to improving quality, increasing yield and providing a \\"natural\\" resistance to pests. The implementation of mechanical harvesting is often stimulated by changes in labor laws, labor shortages, and bureaucratic complications. It can be expensive to hire labor for short periods of time, which does not square well with the need to reduce production costs and harvest quickly, often at night. However, very small vineyards, incompatible widths between rows of grape vines and steep terrain hinder the employment of machine harvesting even more than the resistance of traditional views which reject such harvesting.  Current trends  A vineyard in Napa Valley, California The Red Vineyard, 1888 by Vincent van Gogh, is the only van Gogh painting sold during his lifetime Numbers of New World vineyard plantings have been increasing almost as fast as European vineyards are being uprooted. Between 1990 and 2003, the number of U.S. vineyards increased from , while Australian vineyard numbers more than doubled from and Chilean vineyards grew from . The size of individual vineyards in the New World is significant. Europe's 1.6 million vineyards are an average of each, while the average Australian vineyard is , providing considerable economies of scale. Exports to Europe from New World growers increased by 54% in the six years up to 2006. There have also been significant changes in the kinds of grapes that are grown. For example, in Chile, large areas of low-quality grapes have been replaced with such grapes as Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon. In Argentina, due to an economic down-turn, acreage of Malbec was significantly reduced in the 1980s,Malbec, Jancis Robinson. but in the 1990s, during the quality revolution incited by Malbec Pioneer Nicol√°s Catena Zapata, growers started planting more Malbec, most notably in higher altitudes where cooler temperatures and more intense sunlight yields more concentrated yet smoother and more complex malbecs.Meet the man who scaled Argentina‚Äôs mountains to bring malbec wine to the world, The Globe and Mail, September 2014. Grape changes are often in response to changing consumer demand but sometimes result from vine pull schemes designed to promote vineyard change. Alternatively, the development of \\"T\\" budding now permits the grafting of a different grape variety onto existing rootstock in the vineyard, making it possible to switch varieties within a two-year period. Local legislation often dictates which varieties are selected, how they are grown, whether vineyards can be irrigated and exactly when grapes can be harvested, all of which in serves to reinforce tradition. Changes in the law can also change which grapes are planted. For example, during Prohibition in the U.S. (1920‚Äì1933), vineyards in California expanded sevenfold to meet the increasing demand for home-brewing. However, they were largely planted in varieties with tough skins that could be transported across the country to home wine-makers and the resulting wine was of a low quality. According to the International Organisation of Vine and Wine, in April 2015, China () overtook France () in terms of land devoted to vineyards, in second place behind Spain (), the world's largest producer. Terroir Malvasia grape vines growing in topsoil, covered in lapilli, La Geria, Lanzarote, Canary Islands. The low, curved walls protect the vines from the constant, drying wind. Wine estate in Hungary Terroir refers to the combination of natural factors associated with any particular vineyard. These factors include things such as soil, underlying rock, altitude, slope of hill or terrain, orientation toward the sun, and microclimate (typical rain, winds, humidity, temperature variations, etc.). No two vineyards have exactly the same terroir, although any difference in the resulting wine may be virtually undetectable. Vineyards are often on located on hillsides and planted in soil that is of only marginal value to other plants. A common saying is that \\"the worse the soil, the better the wine.\\" Planting on hillsides, especially those facing north (in the southern hemisphere) or south (in the northern hemisphere), is most often in an attempt to maximize the amount of sunlight that falls on the vineyard. For this reason, some of the best wines come from vineyards planted on quite steep hills, conditions which would make most other agricultural products uneconomic. The stereotypical vineyard site for wine grapes (in the Northern hemisphere) is a hillside in a dry climate with a southern exposure, good drainage to reduce unnecessary water uptake, and balanced pruning to force the vine to put more of its energy into the fruit, rather than foliage. The terroir philosophy is predominately French in origin, the flavour and character of the place defining the individuality and the special attributes of wines and combined with hundreds of years of the finest wine making traditions, terroir gives wines their distinctive taste and signature. Vignette A vignette is a 500-square-metre vineyard which is part of a larger consolidated vineyard. Investors purchase a piece of land within a vineyard, and outsource the grape maintenance and production operations to an outside grape grower or wine producers. Because they are contracting under a co-operative structure, they benefit from economies of scale and hence cheaper labour and operational costs.

Warriors of Lapulapu, a native chieftain of Mactan, overpowered and defeated a Spanish force fighting for Rajah Humabon of Cebu under the command of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in the battle. The outcome of the battle resulted in the departure of the Spanish crew from the archipelago, and delayed the Spanish colonization of the Philippines by 44 years until the conquest by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi in 1564‚Äì1565. Background Magellan's expedition had left Spain in August 1519 on a mission to find a westward route to the Moluccas or Spice Islands. On 16 March 1521 (Julian calendar), Magellan sighted the mountains of what is now Samar. This event marked the arrival of the first documented Europeans in the archipelago. The following day, Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island. There, Magellan befriended Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siagu, king of Limasawa, who guided him to Cebu. There he met Rajah Humabon, the Rajah of Cebu. Then, Rajah Humabon and his queen were baptized into the Catholic faith, taking the Christian names Carlos, in honor of King Charles of Spain, and Juana, in honor of King Charles' mother. To commemorate this event, Magellan gave Juana the Santo Ni√±o, an image of the infant Jesus, as a symbol of their new alliance and held their first Mass on the coast. As a result of Magellan's influence with Rajah Humabon, an order was issued to the nearby chiefs that each of them were to provide food supplies for the ships, and convert to Christianity. Most chiefs obeyed the order; however, Datu Lapulapu, one of the two chiefs within the island of Mactan, was the only chieftain to show his opposition. Lapulapu refused to accept the authority of Rajah Humabon in these matters. This opposition proved to be influential when Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's voyage chronicler, writes, Rajah Humabon and Datu Zula suggested to Magellan to go to the island of Mactan and force his subject chieftain Datu Lapulapu to comply with his orders. Magellan saw an opportunity to strengthen the existing friendship ties with the ruler of the Visayan region and agreed to help him subdue the resistant Lapulapu. Battle According to the documents of Italian historian Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan tried to convince Lapulapu to comply with Rajah Humabon's orders the night before the battle, Pigafetta writes how Magellan deployed forty-nine armored men with swords, axes, shields, crossbows, and guns, and sailed for Mactan in the morning of 28 April. A number of native warriors who had converted to Christianity also came to their aid. According to Pigafetta, because of the rocky outcroppings, and coral near the beach, the Spanish soldiers could not land on Mactan. Forced to anchor their ships far from shore due to the shallow water filled with rocks and coral reefs, Magellan could not bring his ships' cannons to bear on Lapulapu's warriors, whom Pigafetta claims numbered more than 1,500.Angeles, Jose Amiel. \\"The Battle of Mactan and the Indigenous Discourse on War.\\" Philippine Studies vol. 55, No. 1 (2007): pp. 3-52. Upon landing, Magellan's small force was immediately attacked by the natives with a heavy barrage of ranged weapons, consisting of arrows, iron- tipped \\"bamboo\\" throwing spears (probably rattan bangkaw), fire-hardened sticks, and even stones. They surrounded Magellan's landing party, attacking from the front and both flanks. The heavy armor of the Spaniards largely protected them from this barrage, inflicting only a handful of fatalities on the Europeans, but it was heavily demoralizing on the troops. The musketeers and crossbowmen on the boat tried to provide support by firing from the boats. Though the light armor and the shields of the natives were vulnerable to European projectile weapons, the barrage had little effect, as they were firing from an extreme distance and the natives easily avoided them. Due to the same distance, Magellan could not command them to stop and save their ammunition, and the musketeers and crossbowmen continued firing for half an hour until their ammunition were exhausted. Magellan, hoping to ease the attack set fire to some of the houses, but this only enraged the natives even more. Magellan was finally hit with a poisoned arrow through his unarmored legs, at which time the natives charged the Europeans for close-quarters combat. Many of the warriors specifically attacked Magellan. In the struggle, he was wounded in the arm with a spear and in the leg by a large native sword (likely a kampilan). Those who stood beside him were easily overpowered and killed, while the others who tried to help him were hacked by spears and swords. With this advantage, Lapulapu's troops finally overwhelmed and killed Magellan. Pigafetta and a few others managed to escape. According to Pigafetta, several of Magellan's men were killed in battle, and a number of natives converted to Catholicism who had come to their aid were immediately killed by the warriors. Magellan's allies, Humabon and Zula, were said not to have taken part in the battle due to Magellan's bidding, and they watched from a distance. =Aftermath= When the body of Magellan was recovered by the warriors, Humabon ordered him to return the bodies of Magellan and some of his crew who were killed, and they would be given as much merchandise as they wished. Lapulapu refused. Some of the soldiers who survived the battle and returned to Cebu were poisoned while attending a feast given by Humabon. Magellan was succeeded by Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano as commander of the expedition, who ordered the immediate departure after Humabon's betrayal. Elcano and his fleet sailed west and returned to Spain in 1522, completing the first circumnavigation of the world. In Philippine culture A depiction of Lapulapu at the Lapu-Lapu shrine. memorial to Magellan built by the Spanish. Today, Lapulapu is retroactively honored as the first \\"Philippine national hero\\" to resist foreign rule, even though the territory of the \\"Philippine Islands\\" did not exist at the time, nor was it even named or imagined that way. Lapulapu is remembered by a number of commemorations: statues on the island of Mactan and at the Cebu Provincial Capitol, a city bearing his name, and a local variety of Red Grouper fish. Kapampangan actor-turned-politician Lito Lapid starred in a film called Lapu-Lapu, and novelty singer Yoyoy Villame wrote a folk song entitled \\"Magellan\\" that tells a humorously distorted story of the Battle of Mactan. There is a spot in Mactan Island called the \\"Mactan shrine\\" where the historic battle is reenacted along the mangrove shorelines of the shrine during its anniversary and culminated with the Rampada Festival, a festival reenacting the victory celebration of Mactan after the battle. Appropriately called the \\"Victory of Mactan\\" (Cebuano: Kadaugan sa Mactan), the reenactment is considered as a grand celebration for Cebuanos and one of Cebu's prime festivals together with the Sinulog of Cebu. Usually, during the re-enactment, Filipino celebrities, especially of Cebuano origin, play Lapu-Lapu, his wife Reyna Bulakna, and Ferdinand Magellan. In the same shrine, next to the Lapulapu statue, there is an obelisk erected in Magellan's honor by the Spanish colonial authorities and defaced shortly after the US military occupation of the Philippines. Magellan is also honored for bringing Catholicism to the Philippines in general and the Santo Ni√±o (Child Jesus) to Cebu in particular. The Magellan's Cross and the aforementioned Magellan's shrine were erected in Cebu City. Many landmarks and infrastructures all over the Philippines bear Magellan's name, mostly using its Spanish spelling (Magallanes), which is also a widely used Filipino surname. The inhabitants of the Sulu archipelago believe that Lapulapu was a Muslim (Lapu Lapu among Khidr Army.) of the Sama-Bajau. On April 27, 2017, in honoring Lapulapu as the first hero who resisted foreign rule in the country, the date April 27 when the battle happened was declared by President Rodrigo Duterte as Lapu-Lapu Day. Legends According to native legend, Lapulapu never died but turned into stone, and has since then been guarding the seas of Mactan. Fishermen of the island would throw coins at a stone shaped like a man as a way of asking for permission to fish in the chieftain's territory. Another myth passed on by the natives concerns the statue of Lapulapu erected on a pedestal at the center of the town plaza in Lapu-Lapu City. The statue faced the old city hall building, where the mayors used to hold office; it held a crossbow in the stance of appearing to shoot an enemy. Some superstitious people of the city proposed to change this crossbow with a sword, after a succession of three mayors died due to a heart attack. Another legend suggests that after the battle, Lapulapu left Mactan and lived on a mountain.

The division operates under NBCUniversal News Group, a division of NBCUniversal, which is, in turn, a subsidiary of Comcast. The news division's various operations report to the president of NBC News, Noah Oppenheim. The NBCUniversal News Group also comprises MSNBC, the network's 24-hour general news channel, business and consumer news channels CNBC and CNBC World, the Spanish language Noticias Telemundo and United Kingdom-based Sky News. NBC News aired the first, regularly scheduled news program in American broadcast television history on February 21, 1940. The group's broadcasts are produced and aired from 30 Rockefeller Center, NBC's headquarters in New York City. The division presides over America's number- one-rated newscast, NBC Nightly News, and the longest-running television series in American history, Meet The Press, the Sunday morning program of newsmakers interviews. NBC News also offers 70 years of rare historic footage from the NBCUniversal Archives online. History=Caravan era= The first regularly scheduled American television newscast in history was made by NBC News on February 21, 1940, anchored by Lowell Thomas (1892-1981), and airing weeknights at 6:45 p.m. It was simply Lowell Thomas in front of a television camera while doing his NBC network radio broadcast, the television simulcast seen only in New York. In June 1940, NBC, through its flagship station in New York City, W2XBS (renamed commercial WNBT in 1941, now WNBC) operating on channel one, televised 30¬º hours of coverage of the Republican National Convention live and direct from Philadelphia. The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper New York State, for rebroadcast on W2XB in Schenectady (now WRGB), making this among the first \\"network\\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day. About this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, (WNBC), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now KYW- TV) in Philadelphia and WRGB in Schenectady, NY. Such as, Esso sponsored news features a well as The War As It Happens in the final days of World War II, another irregularly scheduled NBC television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, NBC Television Newsreel aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by Camel Cigarettes, NBC Television Newsreel was renamed Camel Newsreel Theatre and then, when John Cameron Swayze was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed Camel News Caravan. In 1948, NBC teamed up with Life magazine to provide election night coverage of President Harry S. Truman's surprising victory over New York governor Thomas E. Dewey. The television audience was small, but NBC's share in New York was double that of any other outlet.\\"New York City Hooper Ratings for Election Night 1948\\" TVObscurities.com. The following year, the Camel News Caravan, anchored by John Cameron Swayze, debuted on NBC. Lacking the graphics and technology of later years, it nonetheless contained many of the elements of modern newscasts. NBC hired its own film crews and in the program's early years, it dominated CBS's competing program, which did not hire its own film crews until 1953. (by contrast, CBS spent lavishly on Edward R. Murrow's weekly series, See It Now). In 1950, David Brinkley began serving as the program's Washington correspondent, but attracted little attention outside the network until paired with Chet Huntley in 1956. In 1955, the Camel News Caravan fell behind CBS's Douglas Edwards with the News, and Swayze lost the already tepid support of NBC executives. The following year, NBC replaced the program with the Huntley- Brinkley Report. Beginning in 1951, NBC News was managed by Director of News Bill McAndrew, who reported to Vice President of News and Public Affairs J. Davidson Taylor. =Huntley-Brinkley era= NBC News had close to 700 correspondents and cameramen in 1961 who were stationed throughout the world. Film was received in the United States by plane or by the jointly operated NBC-BBC transatlantic film cable. Television assumed an increasingly prominent role in American family life in the late 1950s, and NBC News was called television's \\"champion of news coverage.\\" NBC president Robert Kintner provided the news division with ample amounts of both financial resources and air time. In 1956, the network paired anchors Chet Huntley and David Brinkley and the two became celebrities, supported by reporters including John Chancellor, Frank McGee, Edwin Newman, Sander Vanocur, Nancy Dickerson, Tom Pettit, and Ray Scherer. Created by Producer Reuven Frank, NBC's The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report had its debut on October 29, 1956. During much of its 14-year run, it exceeded the viewership levels of its CBS News competition, anchored initially by Douglas Edwards and, beginning in April 1962, by Walter Cronkite. NBC Logo 1954 NBC's Vice President of News and Public Affairs, J. Davidson Taylor, was a Southerner who, with Producer Reuven Frank, was determined that NBC would lead television's coverage of the civil rights movement. In 1955, NBC provided national coverage of Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, airing reports from Frank McGee, then News Director of NBC's Montgomery affiliate WSFA-TV, who would later join the network. A year later, John Chancellor's coverage of the admission of black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas was the first occasion when the key news story came from television rather than print and prompted a prominent U.S. senator to observe later, \\"When I think of Little Rock, I think of John Chancellor.\\" Other reporters who covered the movement for the network included Sander Vanocur, Herbert Kaplow, Charles Quinn, and Richard Valeriani, who was hit with an ax handle at a demonstration in Marion, Alabama in 1965. While Walter Cronkite's enthusiasm for the space race eventually won the anchorman viewers for CBS and NBC News, with the work of correspondents such as Frank McGee, Roy Neal, Jay Barbree, and Peter Hackes, also provided ample coverage of American manned space missions in the Project Mercury, Project Gemini, and Project Apollo programs. In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage, NBC configured its largest studio, Studio 8H, for space coverage. It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft, maps of the earth and moon to show orbital trackage, and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer Bil Baird were used to depict movements of astronauts before on- board spacecraft television cameras were feasible. (Studio 8H had been home to the NBC Symphony Orchestra and is now the home of Saturday Night Live.) NBC's coverage of the first moon landing in 1969 earned the network an Emmy Award. In the late 1950s, Kintner reorganized the chain of command at the network, making Bill McAndrew president of NBC News, reporting directly to Kintner. McAndrew served in that position until his death in 1968. McAndrew was succeeded by his Executive Vice President, Producer Reuven Frank, who held the position until 1973. On November 22, 1963, NBC interrupted various programs on its affiliate stations at 1:45 p.m. to announce that President John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas, Texas. Eight minutes later, at 1:53:12 p.m., NBC broke into programming with a network bumper slide and Chet Huntley, Bill Ryan and Frank McGee informing the viewers what was going on as it happened; but since a camera was not in service, the reports were audio-only. However, NBC did not begin broadcasting over the air until 1:57 p.m. ET. About 40 minutes later, after word came that JFK was pronounced dead, NBC suspended regular programming and carried 71 hours of uninterrupted news coverage of the assassination and the funeral of the president‚Äîincluding the only live broadcast of the fatal shooting of Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, by Jack Ruby as Oswald was being led in handcuffs by law-enforcement officials through the basement of Dallas Police Headquarters. =NBC Nightly News era= NBC Nightly News Logo 2019 NBC's ratings lead began to slip toward the end of the 1960s and fell sharply when Chet Huntley retired in 1970 (Huntley died of cancer in 1974). The loss of Huntley, along with a reluctance by RCA to fund NBC News at a similar level as CBS was funding its news division, left NBC News in the doldrums. NBC's primary news show gained its present title, NBC Nightly News, on August 3, 1970. The network tried a platoon of anchors (Brinkley, McGee, and John Chancellor) during the early months of Nightly News. Despite the efforts of the network's eventual lead anchor, the articulate, even-toned Chancellor, and an occasional first-place finish in the Nielsens, Nightly News in the 1970s was primarily a strong second. By the end of the decade, NBC had to contend not only with a powerful CBS but also a surging ABC, led by Roone Arledge. Tom Brokaw became sole anchor in 1983, after co-anchoring with Roger Mudd for a year, and began leading NBC's efforts. In 1986 and 1987, NBC won the top spot in the Nielsens for the first time in years, only to fall back when Nielsen's ratings methodology changed. In late 1996, Nightly News again moved into first place, a spot it has held onto in most of the succeeding years. Brian Williams assumed primary anchor duties when Brokaw retired in December 2004. In February 2015, NBC suspended Williams for six months for telling an inaccurate story about his experience in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was replaced by Lester Holt on an interim basis. On June 18, 2015, it was announced that Holt would become the permanent anchor and Williams would be moved to MSNBC as an anchor of breaking news and special reports beginning in August. NBC Nightly News Set In 1993, Dateline NBC broadcast an investigative report about the safety of General Motors (GM) trucks. GM discovered the \\"actual footage\\" utilized in the broadcast had been rigged by the inclusion of explosive incendiaries attached to the gas tanks and the use of improper sealants for those tanks. GM subsequently filed an anti-defamation lawsuit against NBC, which publicly admitted the results of the tests were rigged and settled the lawsuit with GM on the very same day. On October 22, 2007, Nightly News moved into its new high definition studios, at Studio 3C at NBC Studios in 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City. The network's 24-hour cable network, MSNBC, joined the network in New York on that day as well. The new studios/headquarters for NBC News and MSNBC are now located in one area. = 2007‚Äì2016 = During the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, NBC News was urged to save $500 million by NBC Universal. On that occasion, NBC News laid off several of its in-house reporters such as Kevin Corke, Jeannie Ohm and Don Teague. This was the largest layoff in NBC News history. After the sudden death of the influential moderator Tim Russert of Meet the Press in June 2008, Tom Brokaw took over as an interim host; and on December 14, 2008, David Gregory became the new moderator of the show until August 14, 2014, when NBC announced that NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd would take over as the 12th moderator of Meet the Press starting September 7, 2014. David Gregory's last broadcast was August 10, 2014. By 2009, NBC had established leadership in network news, airing the highest-rated morning, evening, and Sunday interview news programs. Its ability to share costs with MSNBC and share in the cable network's advertising and subscriber revenue made it far more profitable than its network rivals. NBC Nightly News broadcast, March 2008. On March 27, 2012, NBC News broadcast an edited segment from a 911 call placed by George Zimmerman before he shot Trayvon Martin. The editing made it appear that Zimmerman volunteered that Martin was black, rather than merely responding to the dispatcher's inquiry, which would support a view that the shooting was racially motivated. A media watchdog organization accused NBC News of engaging in \\"an all-out falsehood.\\" While NBC News initially declined to comment, the news agency did issue an apology to viewers. The Washington Post called the statement \\"skimpy on the details on just how the mistake unfolded.\\" On December 13, 2012, NBC News reporter Richard Engel and his five crew members, Aziz Akyava≈ü, Ghazi Balkiz, John Kooistra, Ian Rivers and Ammar Cheikh Omar, were kidnapped in Syria. Having escaped after five days in captivity, Engel said he believed that a Shabiha group loyal to al-Assad was behind the abduction, and that the crew was freed by the Ahrar al-Sham group five days later. Engel's account was however challenged from early on. In April 2015, NBC had to revise the kidnapping account, following further investigations by The New York Times, which suggested that the NBC team \\"was almost certainly taken by a Sunni criminal element affiliated with the Free Syrian Army,\\" rather than by a loyalist Shia group. In 2013 John Lapinski was Director of Elections, replacing Sheldon Gawiser. In 2015 the election team's decision desk group was given its first permanent space at 30 Rockefeller, replacing the News Sales Archives that had occupied the space previously. The NBC News Division was the first news team to possess the tape of Donald Trump recorded by Access Hollywood, after a producer of the NBC show had made the News Division aware of it; the News Division internally debated publishing it for three days, and then an unidentified source gave a copy of the tape to Washington Post Reporter David Fahrenthold, who contacted NBC for comment, notified the Trump campaign that he had the video, obtained confirmation of its authenticity, and released a story and the tape itself, scooping NBC. Alerted that the Post might release the story immediately, NBC News released its own story shortly after the Post story was published. = Sexual Misconduct and NBC News = Matt Lauer at the 2012 Time 100 gala. On November 29, 2017, NBC News announced that Matt Lauer's employment had been terminated after an unidentified female NBC employee reported that Lauer had sexually harassed her during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and that the harassment continued after they returned to New York. NBC News management said it had been aware that The New York Times and Variety had been conducting independent investigations of Lauer's behavior, but that management had been unaware of previous allegations against Lauer. Linda Vester, a former NBC News correspondent, disputed the claims that management knew nothing, saying that \\"everybody knew\\" that Lauer was dangerous. According to Ronan Farrow, multiple sources have stated that NBC News was not only aware of Lauer's misconduct beforehand, but that Harvey Weinstein used this knowledge to pressure them into killing a story that would have outed his own sexual misconduct. Variety reported allegations by at least ten of Lauer's current and former colleagues. Additional accusations went public in the ensuing days. NBC News President Noah Oppenheim suggested an investigation into alleged sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein after NBC contributor Ronan Farrow pitched a general idea to report on sexual harassment in Hollywood. After a 10-month investigation by Farrow and NBC Producer Rich McHugh, NBC chose not to publish it. The story, with very few changes, was published a few weeks later in the New Yorker Magazine instead. A story on the subject of Weinstein's alleged behavior also appeared several days earlier in The New York Times. Following criticism for missing a major story it had initiated, NBC News defended the decision, saying that at the time Farrow was at NBC, the early reporting still had important missing necessary elements. Farrow later disputed this characterization, saying that he had multiple named accusers willing to come forward and that the version ultimately published in the New Yorker had very few changes from the version that NBC News rejected. This version went on to win the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in April 2018. A former NBC News executive has said that the story on Weinstein was killed because NBC News was aware of the sexual misconduct by Lauer; in Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, Ronan Farrow cites two sources within American Media, Inc stating that the story was killed in response to an overt threat from Weinstein to out Lauer.

It has been available on iHeartRadio, iHeartMedia's online live audio and podcasting platform, on different supports (Web and smartphone apps) since July 2016. It can be heard around the clock in 15-minute cycles with the latest news, sports and other features. It uses the slogan \\"The news you want, when you want it.\\"iHeart.com/live/NBC-News-Radio While it is not owned by NBCUniversal itself, it features reports from NBC News correspondents, presented by anchors who are iHeartMedia employees. It is also provided to NBC's 24/7 News Source radio station affiliates as a service, including one-minute and two-minute hourly newscasts along with other audio content, such as features on money, health, politics and sports, heard on over 1,000 radio stations. As of 2016, WOR in New York City serves as NBC News Radio's East Coast flagship station, while KOGO in San Diego serves as the network's West Coast flagship station. The current NBC News Radio digital station is NBC's first step into the all-news radio format since the closure of its ephemeral NBC News & Information Service (NIS), a former analog radio network targeted at FM stations, which lasted only from 1975 till 1977. The original major NBC Radio Network would be purchased by Westwood One a decade later, in 1987, as General Electric, which had acquired NBC's parent company RCA, divested most properties not pertaining to the NBC television network, thus ending its direct participation in the radio business. NBC Radio Network's news operation was merged into the Mutual Broadcasting System, then into Westwood One's then-corporate sibling CBS Radio, and eventually assimilated into the syndicator itself. For years, Westwood One has carried on syndicating several NBC-branded shows to affiliate radio stations, including audio versions of current-affairs NBC TV shows such as Meet the Press, a practice that continues to date. As for hard news programming, Westwood One used to provide an homonymous NBC News Radio service, which was initially limited to a feed of one-hour reports updated from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET offered to subscriber local stations. Dial Global ‚Äìwhich has branded itself Westwood One since 2013‚Äì announced on March 5, 2012 its aim to expand NBC News Radio to a full-time 24-hour radio news network, replacing CNN Radio (that itself replaced both NBC Radio and Mutual in 1999). The original NBC News Radio service was eventually discontinued on December 14, 2014, coinciding with the launch of the new, white-label Westwood One News service, which uses content and human resources from WarnerMedia's CNN instead of those of NBC News. In addition to NBC News Radio, audio-only simulcast of NBC News' TV channels MSNBC and CNBC are also officially available as Internet radio stations through the TuneIn podcasting service as well as the SiriusXM satellite radio platform. =NBC News Overnight and NBC Nightside= In 1982, NBC News began production on NBC News Overnight with anchors Linda Ellerbee, Lloyd Dobyns, and Bill Schechner. It usually aired at 1:35 a.m. E.T., following The Tonight Show and Late Night with David Letterman. NBC News Overnight was cancelled in December 1983, but in 1991, NBC News launched another overnight news show called NBC Nightside. During its run, the show's anchors included Sara James, Bruce Hall, Antonio Mora, Tom Miller, Campbell Brown, Kim Hindrew, Tom Donavan, and Tonya Strong. It was based at NBC Network affiliate WCNC-TV in Charlotte, North Carolina. It provided an overnight news service which NBC affiliates could air until early morning programming began, in effect providing programming to help them stay on the air 24/7. At the time, a few NBC affiliates had begun using CNN's Headline News service to provide overnight programming, and NBC decided to offer the network's own overnight news service. CBS and ABC also began their own overnight news programming, as well. In addition, the facility produced a 24-hour news service aimed to Latin American viewers called \\"Canal de Noticias, NBC. The serviced closed in 1997 and five years later, the network bought Telemundo. NBC Nightside lasted until 1998 and was replaced by \\"NBC All Night,\\" composed of reruns of The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and later from January 1, 2007 to September 23, 2011, Poker After Dark. NBC now airs same day repeats of the fourth hour of Today and CNBC's Mad Money on weekdays, LXTV programs on early Sunday mornings, and Meet the Press and Dateline encores on early Monday mornings.

The first Irish legislature was the Parliament of Ireland. However, after its abolition, in 1801, there was no legislature in Ireland, of any kind until 1919. Since that date a number of legislatures have existed on the island. Parliament of Ireland This body consisted of the King of Ireland and two chambers: the Irish House of Commons and the Irish House of Lords) which existed in Lordship of Ireland (1171‚Äì1541) and the Kingdom of Ireland (1541‚Äì1800). This parliament operated under major restrictions, including Poynings' Law and the Penal Laws, imposed by the English and British Crown, by the English and British Parliament and by the King-in-Council. Many of these restrictions were removed in 1782, producing what became known as the Constitution of 1782. The Kingdom of Ireland merged with the Kingdom of Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. It was subject to an Irish executive, presided over by the English/British selected Lord Lieutenant of Ireland (previously called the 'Lord Deputy'), which was ultimately answerable not to it but to the English/British Government in London. Over the centuries, the Irish parliament met in a number of locations both inside and outside Dublin. Among its most famous meeting places were Dublin Castle, the Bluecoat School, Chichester House and its final permanent home, the Irish Houses of Parliament in College Green, also sometimes called the Irish Parliament House. It is now generally called the \\"Bank of Ireland\\", an institution which took ownership of the building in 1804 and used it as its headquarters until the 1970s, when a new headquarters was built. The former seat of parliament remains a branch of the bank. In 1642‚Äì49, during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, there was brief experiment in independent Irish government known as Confederate Ireland. Its legislature, the General Assembly, met once a year in Kilkenny to review the work of the executive branch (which it appointed) - the Supreme Council. D√°il √âireann (1919‚Äì1922) This was a revolutionary parliament formed by Irish MPs elected to the British House of Commons, who assembled in Dublin in January 1919. D√°il √âireann operated under a temporary constitution, called the D√°il Constitution, which created a prime minister called the President of D√°il √âireann (also known as Pr√≠omh Aire) and a Ministry of D√°il √âireann. During the period from August 1921 to January 1922, √âamon de Valera used the title President of the Irish Republic. The D√°il met in two locations, in the Round Room of the Mansion House, and later in the then University College Dublin campus in Earslfort Terrace in Dublin, where its famously ratified the Anglo-Irish Treaty in December 1921. Parliament of Southern Ireland (1920‚Äì1922) The Parliament of Southern Ireland was created by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, and consisted of the House of Commons of Southern Ireland and the Senate. This parliament did not in reality function, except to ratify the Anglo-Irish Treaty in January 1922. In 1922, a government theoretically answerable to the House of Commons of Southern Ireland, called the Provisional Government of Ireland, was created under Michael Collins. The House of Commons was officially based in the Royal College of Science in Dublin, now the Irish Government Buildings. However the Commons only met on a handful of occasions, primarily to ratify the Treaty in January 1922 and confirm Michael Collins as head of the Provisional Government. Oireachtas of the Irish Free State (1922‚Äì1937) This legislature consisted of the King and two chambers: the Free State D√°il and the Free State Seanad (Senate of Ireland). It created by the Irish Free State's 1922 Constitution. The Seanad and the King's role in the Oireachtas were both abolished by constitutional amendment in 1936. The executive was answerable to D√°il √âireann, was called the Executive Council and was presided over by a prime minister called the President of the Executive Council. The Provisional Government under W. T. Cosgrave hired the use of the main lecture theatre of the Royal Dublin Society in its headquarters in Leinster House, a formal ducal palace, to enable a formal state opening of the new two chamber Oireachtas of the new Irish Free State and the delivery of the speech from the throne by the new Governor-General of the Irish Free State, Tim Healy in December 1922. In 1924, the new Free State under Cosgrave bought Leinster House as a temporary seat of parliament, pending the erection or conversion of an alternative. One major contender for the location was Royal Hospital Kilmainham, a former soldiers' home that ultimately became a modern art gallery. Oireachtas √âireann (since 1937) This Oireachtas consists of the President of Ireland and two chambers: the modern D√°il √âireann and Seanad √âireann. It was established by the 1937 Constitution. The executive is called the Government and is answerable to the D√°il. It is presided over by a prime minister called the Taoiseach. Though plans were periodically discussed for the erection of a new parliament building (a site was even considered in the Phoenix Park), parliament has remained in Leinster House, to which additional offices were added in the 1950s and most recently in the year 2000.

He was also known for his extensive coverage of the U.S. space program, from Project Mercury to the Moon landings to the Space Shuttle. He was the only non-NASA recipient of an Ambassador of Exploration award. Cronkite is known for his departing catchphrase, \\"And that's the way it is\\", followed by the date of the broadcast.  Early life and education  Cronkite was born on November 4, 1916, in Saint Joseph, Missouri, the son of Helen Lena (n√©e Fritsche) and Dr. Walter Leland Cronkite, a dentist. Cronkite lived in Kansas City, Missouri, until he was ten, when his family moved to Houston, Texas. He attended elementary school at Woodrow Wilson Elementary School, junior high school at Lanier Junior High School (now Lanier Middle School) and high school at San Jacinto High School, where he edited the high school newspaper. He was a member of the Boy Scouts. He attended college at the University of Texas at Austin (UT), entering in the Fall term of 1933, where he worked on the Daily Texan and became a member of the Nu chapter of the Chi Phi Fraternity. He also was a member of the Houston chapter of DeMolay, a Masonic fraternal organization for boys. While attending UT, Cronkite had his first taste of performance, appearing in a play with fellow student Eli Wallach. He dropped out in 1935, not returning for the Fall term, in order to concentrate on journalism.  Career  He dropped out of college in his junior year, in the fall term of 1935, after starting a series of newspaper reporting jobs covering news and sports. He entered broadcasting as a radio announcer for WKY in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1936, he met his future wife, Mary Elizabeth \\"Betsy\\" Maxwell, while working as the sports announcer for KCMO (AM) in Kansas City, Missouri. His broadcast name was \\"Walter Wilcox\\". He would explain later that radio stations at the time did not want people to use their real names for fear of taking their listeners with them if they left. In Kansas City, he joined the United Press International in 1937. He became one of the top American reporters in World War II, covering battles in North Africa and Europe. With his name now established, he received a job offer from Edward R. Murrow at CBS News to join the Murrow Boys team of war correspondents, relieving Bill Downs as the head of the Moscow bureau. CBS offered Cronkite $125 ($2,235 in 2020 money) a week along with \\"commercial fees\\" amounting to $25 ($447 in 2020) for almost every time Cronkite reported on air. Up to that point, he had been making $57.50 ($1,027 in 2020) per week at UP, but he had reservations about broadcasting. He initially accepted the offer. When he informed his boss Harrison Salisbury, UP countered with a raise of $17.50 ($312 in 2020) per week; Hugh Baillie also offered him an extra $20 ($357 in 2020) per week to stay. Cronkite ultimately accepted the UP offer, a move which angered Murrow and drove a wedge between them that would last for years. Cronkite was on board starting in Norfolk, Virginia, through her service off the coast of North Africa as part of Operation Torch, and thence back to the US. On the return trip, Cronkite was flown off Texas in one of her Vought OS2U Kingfisher aircraft when Norfolk was within flying distance. He was granted permission to be flown the rest of the distance to Norfolk so that he could outpace a rival correspondent on to return to the US and to issue the first uncensored news reports to published about Operation Torch. Cronkite's experiences aboard Texas launched his career as a war correspondent. Subsequently, he was one of eight journalists selected by the United States Army Air Forces to fly bombing raids over Germany in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress part of group called The Writing 69th, and during a mission fired a machine gun at a German fighter. He also landed in a glider with the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Market Garden and covered the Battle of the Bulge. After the war, he covered the Nuremberg trials and served as the United Press main reporter in Moscow from 1946 to 1948. = Early years at CBS = In 1950, Cronkite joined CBS News in its young and growing television division, again recruited by Murrow. Cronkite began working at WTOP-TV (now WUSA), the CBS affiliate in Washington, D.C.. He originally served as anchor of the network's 15-minute late-Sunday-evening newscast Up To the Minute, which followed What's My Line? at 11:00 pm ET from 1951 through 1962. Although it was widely reported that the term \\"anchor\\" was coined to describe Cronkite's role at both the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, marking the first nationally televised convention coverage, other news presenters bore the title before him. Cronkite anchored the network's coverage of the 1952 presidential election as well as later conventions. In 1964 he was temporarily replaced by the team of Robert Trout and Roger Mudd; this proved to be a mistake, and Cronkite returned to the anchor chair for future political conventions.Brinkley, pp. 320‚Äì321. From 1953 to 1957, Cronkite hosted the CBS program You Are There, which reenacted historical events, using the format of a news report. His famous last line for these programs was: \\"What sort of day was it? A day like all days, filled with those events that alter and illuminate our times ... and you were there.\\" In 1971, the show was revived and redesigned to attract an audience of teenagers and young adults, hosted again by Cronkite on Saturday mornings. In 1957, he began hosting The Twentieth Century (eventually renamed The 20th Century), a documentary series about important historical events of the century composed almost exclusively of newsreel footage and interviews. A long-running hit, the show was again renamed as The 21st Century in 1967 with Cronkite hosting speculative reporting on the future for another three years. Cronkite also hosted It's News to Me, a game show based on news events. During the presidential elections of 1952 and 1956 Cronkite hosted the CBS news- discussion series Pick the Winner. Another of his network assignments was The Morning Show, CBS' short-lived challenge to NBC's Today in 1954. His on-air duties included interviewing guests and chatting with a lion puppet named Charlemane about the news. He considered this discourse with a puppet as \\"one of the highlights\\" of the show. He added, \\"A puppet can render opinions on people and things that a human commentator would not feel free to utter. I was and I am proud of it.\\" Cronkite also angered the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the show's sponsor, by grammatically correcting its advertising slogan. Instead of saying \\"Winston tastes good like a cigarette should\\" verbatim, he substituted \\"as\\" for \\"like.\\" He was the lead broadcaster of the network's coverage of the 1960 Winter Olympics, the first-ever time such an event was televised in the United States. He replaced Jim McKay, who had suffered a mental breakdown. = Anchor of the CBS Evening News = A title card still from the April 4, 1968, edition of the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, the evening of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.. On April 16, 1962, Cronkite succeeded Douglas Edwards as anchorman of the CBS's nightly feature newscast, tentatively renamed Walter Cronkite with the News, but later the CBS Evening News on September 2, 1963, when the show was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes, making Cronkite the anchor of American network television's first nightly half-hour news program.Brinkley, p. 256. Cronkite's tenure as anchor of the CBS Evening News made him an icon in television news. During the early part of his tenure anchoring the CBS Evening News, Cronkite competed against NBC's anchor team of Chet Huntley and David Brinkley, who anchored The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report. For much of the 1960s, The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report had more viewers than Cronkite's broadcast. A key moment for Cronkite came during his coverage of John F. Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963. Another factor in Cronkite and CBS' ascendancy to the top of the ratings was that, as the decade progressed, RCA made a corporate decision not to fund NBC News at the levels that CBS provided for its news broadcasts. Consequently, CBS News acquired a reputation for greater accuracy and depth in coverage. This reputation meshed well with Cronkite's wire service experience, and in 1967 the CBS Evening News began to surpass The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report in viewership during the summer months. In 1969, during the Apollo 11 (with co- host and former astronaut Wally Schirra) and Apollo 13 Moon missions, Cronkite received the best ratings and made CBS the most-watched television network for the missions. In 1970, when Huntley retired, the CBS Evening News finally dominated the American TV news viewing audience. Although NBC finally settled on the skilled and well-respected broadcast journalist John Chancellor, Cronkite proved to be more popular and continued to be top-rated until his retirement in 1981. One of Cronkite's trademarks was ending the CBS Evening News with the phrase \\"...And that's the way it is,\\" followed by the date. Keeping to standards of objective journalism, he omitted this phrase on nights when he ended the newscast with opinion or commentary. Beginning with January 16, 1980, Day 50 of the Iran hostage crisis, Cronkite added the length of the hostages' captivity to the show's closing in order to remind the audience of the unresolved situation, ending only on Day 444, January 20, 1981.CBS News Transcripts, January 16, 1980.  Historic moments= Kennedy's assassination = Cronkite announcing the death of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963 Cronkite is vividly remembered for breaking the news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy on Friday, November 22, 1963. Cronkite had been standing at the United Press International wire machine in the CBS newsroom as the bulletin of the President's shooting broke and he clamored to get on the air to break the news as he wanted CBS to be the first network to do so. There was a problem facing the crew in the newsroom, however. There was no television camera in the studio at the time as the technical crew was working on it. Eventually, the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom.Secrets of the Dead season 13, episode 1: \\"JFK: One PM Central Standard Time\\". Produced by WNET, premiered November 13, 2013, on PBS. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence but the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera to see if they could get it set up quicker. Meanwhile, CBS was ten minutes into its live broadcast of the soap opera As the World Turns (ATWT), which had begun at the very minute of the shooting. A \\"CBS News Bulletin\\" bumper slide abruptly broke into the broadcast at 1:40 pm EST. Over the slide, Cronkite began reading what would be the first of three audio-only bulletins that were filed in the next twenty minutes: While Cronkite was reading this bulletin, a second one arrived, mentioning the severity of Kennedy's wounds: Just before the bulletin cut out, a CBS News staffer was heard saying \\"Connally too,\\" apparently having just heard the news that Texas Governor John Connally had also been shot while riding in the presidential limousine with his wife Nellie and Mr. and Mrs. Kennedy. CBS then rejoined the telecast of ATWT during a commercial break, which was followed by show announcer Dan McCullough's usual fee plug for the first half of the program and the network's 1:45 pm station identification break. Just before the second half of ATWT was to begin, the network broke in with the bumper slide a second time. In this bulletin Cronkite reported in greater detail about the assassination attempt on the President, while also breaking the news of Governor Connally's shooting. Cronkite then recapped the events as they had happened: that the President and Governor Connally had been shot and were in the emergency room at Parkland Hospital, and no one knew their condition as yet. CBS then decided to return to ATWT, which was now midway through its second segment. The cast had continued to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break would be the last anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy had been shot in the head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 pm EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network. He then left the radio booth and went to the anchor desk in the newsroom. Within twenty seconds of the announcement, every CBS affiliate except Dallas' KRLD (which was providing local coverage) was airing the network's feed. The camera was finally operational by this time and enabled the audience to see Cronkite, who was clad in shirt and tie but without his suit coat, given the urgent nature of the story. Cronkite reminded the audience, again, of the attempt made on the life of the President and tossed to KRLD news director Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart, where Kennedy was supposed to be making a speech before he was shot. Barker relayed information that Kennedy's condition was extremely critical. Then, after a prayer for Kennedy, Barker quoted an unofficial report that the President was dead but stressed it was not confirmed. After several minutes, the coverage came back to the CBS newsroom where Cronkite reported that the President had been given blood transfusions and two priests had been called into the room. He also played an audio report from KRLD that someone had been arrested in the assassination attempt at the Texas School Book Depository. Back in Dallas Barker announced another report of the death of the President, mentioning that it came from a reliable source. Before the network left KRLD's feed for good, Barker first announced, then retracted, a confirmation of Kennedy's death. CBS cut back to Cronkite reporting that one of the priests had administered last rites to the president. In the next few minutes, several more bulletins reporting that Kennedy had died were given to Cronkite, including one from CBS's own correspondent Dan Rather that had been reported as confirmation of Kennedy's demise by CBS Radio. As these bulletins came into the newsroom, it was becoming clearer that Kennedy had in fact lost his life. Cronkite, however, stressed that these bulletins were simply reports and not any official confirmation of the President's condition; some of his colleagues recounted in 2013 that his early career as a wire service reporter taught him to wait for official word before reporting a story. Still, as more word came in, Cronkite seemed to be resigned to the fact that it was only a matter of time before the assassination was confirmed. He appeared to concede this when, several minutes after he received the Rather report, he received word that the two priests who gave the last rites to Kennedy told reporters on the scene that he was dead. Cronkite said that report \\"seems to be as close to official as we can get\\", but would not declare it as such. Nor did he do so with a report from Washington, DC that came moments later, which said that government sources were now reporting the President was dead (this information was passed on to ABC as well, which took it as official confirmation and reported it as such; NBC did not report this information at all and chose instead to rely on reports from Charles Murphy and Robert MacNeil to confirm their suspicions). At 2:38 pm EST, while filling in time with some observations about the security presence in Dallas, which had been increased due to a disastrous visit by United Nations Ambassador Adlai Stevenson to the city earlier that year, Cronkite was handed a new bulletin. After looking it over for a moment, he took off his glasses, and made the official announcement: After making that announcement, Cronkite paused briefly, put his glasses back on, and swallowed hard to maintain his composure. With noticeable emotion in his voice he intoned the next sentence of the news report: With emotion still in his voice and eyes watering, Cronkite once again recapped the events after collecting himself, incorporating some wire photos of the visit and explaining the significance of the pictures now that Kennedy was dead. He reminded the viewers that Vice President Johnson was now the President and was to be sworn in, that Governor Connally's condition was still unknown, and that there was no report of whether the assassin had been captured. He then handed the anchor position to Charles Collingwood, who had just entered the newsroom, took his suit coat, and left the room for a while. At about 3:30 pm EST, Cronkite came back into the newsroom to relay some new information. The two major pieces of information involved the Oath of Office being administered to now-President Johnson, which officially made him the thirty-sixth President, and that Dallas police had arrested a man named Lee Harvey Oswald whom they suspected had fired the fatal shots. After that, Cronkite left again to begin preparing for that night's CBS Evening News, which he returned to anchor as normal. For the next four days, along with his colleagues, Cronkite continued to report segments of uninterrupted coverage of the assassination, including the announcement of Oswald's death in the hands of Jack Ruby on Sunday. The next day, on the day of the funeral, Cronkite concluded CBS Evening News with the following assessment about the events of the last four dark days: Referring to his coverage of Kennedy's assassination, in a 2006 TV interview with Nick Clooney, Cronkite recalled, In a 2003 CBS special commemorating the 40th anniversary of the assassination, Cronkite recalled his reaction upon having the death confirmed to him, he said, According to historian Douglas Brinkley, Cronkite provided a sense of perspective throughout the unfolding sequence of disturbing events. = Vietnam War = In mid-February 1968, on the urging of his executive producer Ernest Leiser, Cronkite and Leiser journeyed to Vietnam to cover the aftermath of the Tet Offensive. They were invited to dine with General Creighton Abrams, the commander of all forces in Vietnam, whom Cronkite knew from World War II. According to Leiser, Abrams told Cronkite, \\"we cannot win this Goddamned war, and we ought to find a dignified way out.\\" Upon return, Cronkite and Leiser wrote separate editorial reports based on that trip. Cronkite, an excellent writer, preferred Leiser's text over his own. On February 27, 1968, Cronkite closed \\"Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?\\" with that editorial report: Cronkite reported on location during the Vietnam War. Following Cronkite's editorial report, President Lyndon Johnson is claimed by some to have said, \\"If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.\\" This account has been questioned by other observers in books on journalistic accuracy. At the time the editorial aired, Johnson was in Austin, Texas attending Texas Governor John Connally's birthday gala and was giving a speech in his honor. In his book This Just In: What I Couldn't Tell You on TV, CBS News correspondent Bob Schieffer, who was serving as a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram when Cronkite's editorial aired, acknowledged that Johnson did not see the original broadcast but also defended the allegation that Johnson had made the remark. According to Schieffer, Johnson's aide George Christian \\"told me that the President apparently saw some clips of it the next day\\" and that \\"That's when he made the remark about Cronkite. But he knew then that it would take more than Americans were willing to give it.\\" When asked about the remark during a 1979 interview, Christian claimed he had no recollection about what the President had said. In his 1996 memoir A Reporter's Life, Cronkite claimed he was at first unsure about how much of an impact his editorial report had on Johnson's decision to drop his bid for re-election, and what eventually convinced him that the President had made the statement was Bill Moyers, fellow journalist and former aide to Johnson, telling him \\"The president flipped off the set and said 'If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost Middle America.'\\" Several weeks later, Johnson, who sought to preserve his legacy and was now convinced his declining health could not withstand growing public criticism, announced he would not seek reelection. During the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Cronkite was anchoring the CBS network coverage as violence and protests occurred outside the convention, as well as scuffles inside the convention hall. When Dan Rather was punched to the floor (on camera) by security personnel, Cronkite commented, \\"I think we've got a bunch of thugs here, Dan.\\" = Other historic events = The first publicly transmitted live trans-Atlantic program was broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962, at 3:00 pm EDT, and Cronkite was one of the main presenters in this multinational broadcast. The broadcast was made possible in Europe by Eurovision and in North America by NBC, CBS, ABC, and the CBC. The first public broadcast featured CBS's Cronkite and NBC's Chet Huntley in New York, and the BBC's Richard Dimbleby in Brussels. Cronkite was in the New York studio at Rockefeller Plaza as the first pictures to be transmitted and received were the Statue of Liberty in New York and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The first segment included a televised major league baseball game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. From there, the video switched first to Washington, D.C.; then to Cape Canaveral, Florida; then to Quebec City, Quebec, and finally to Stratford, Ontario. The Washington segment included a press conference with President Kennedy, talking about the price of the American dollar, which was causing concern in Europe. This broadcast inaugurated live intercontinental news coverage, which was perfected later in the sixties with Early Bird and other Intelsat satellites. General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower returned to his former Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) headquarters for an interview by Cronkite on the CBS News Special Report D-Day + 20, telecast on June 6, 1964. Cronkite is also remembered for his coverage of the United States space program, and at times was visibly enthusiastic, rubbing his hands together on camera with a smile and uttering, \\"Whew...boy\\" on July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar landing mission put the first men on the Moon.Brinkley, p. 420. Cronkite participated in Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China. Because Cronkite was colorblind, he had to ask others what color of coat First Lady Pat Nixon was wearing when they disembarked in Peking (Beijing). According to the 2006 PBS documentary on Cronkite, there was \\"nothing new\\" in his reports on the Watergate affair; however, Cronkite brought together a wide range of reporting, and his credibility and status is credited by many with pushing the Watergate story to the forefront with the American public, ultimately resulting in the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon on August 9, 1974. Cronkite had anchored the CBS coverage of Nixon's address, announcing his impending resignation, the night before.Brinkley, pp. 502‚Äì503. The January 22, 1973, broadcast of the CBS Evening News saw Cronkite break the news of the death of another notable American political figure: former president Lyndon B. Johnson. At approximately 6:38 pm Eastern Time, while a pre-recorded report that the Vietnam peace talks in Paris had been successful was being played for the audience, Cronkite received a telephone call in the studio while off camera. The call was from Tom Johnson, the former press secretary for President Johnson who was at the time serving the former chief executive as station manager at KTBC-TV in Austin, Texas, which was affiliated with CBS at the time and was owned by the Johnson family. During the conversation the production staff cut away from the report back to the live camera in studio as Cronkite was still on the phone. After he was made aware that he was back on camera, Cronkite held up a finger to let everyone watching know he required a moment to let Johnson finish talking. Once Cronkite got what he needed, he thanked Johnson and asked him to stay on the line. He then turned to the camera and began to relay what Johnson had said to him. During the final ten minutes of that broadcast, Cronkite reported on the death, giving a retrospective on the life of the nation's 36th president, and announced that CBS would air a special on Johnson later that evening. This story was re-told on a 2007 CBS-TV special honoring Cronkite's 90th birthday. NBC-TV's Garrick Utley, anchoring NBC Nightly News that evening, also interrupted his newscast in order to break the story, doing so about three minutes after Cronkite on CBS. The news was not reported on that night's ABC Evening News, which was anchored by Howard K. Smith and Harry Reasoner, because ABC at the time fed their newscast live at 6:00 pm Eastern instead of 6:30 to get a head start on CBS and NBC for those stations that aired ABC Evening News live (although not every affiliate did). On December 10, 1963, Cronkite introduced The Beatles to the United States by airing a four-minute story about the band on CBS Evening News. This was originally broadcast on November 22, 1963, and was going to be shown again on the CBS Evening News, but the assassination of John F. Kennedy prevented the broadcast at that time.  Retirement  On February 14, 1980, Cronkite announced that he intended to retire from the CBS Evening News; at the time, CBS had a policy of mandatory retirement by age 65.Walter Cronkite at museum.tv . Although sometimes compared to a father figure or an uncle figure, in an interview about his retirement he described himself as being more like a \\"comfortable old shoe\\" to his audience. His last day in the anchor chair at the CBS Evening News was on March 6, 1981; he was succeeded the following Monday by Dan Rather. Cronkite's farewell statement: On the eve of Cronkite's retirement, he appeared on The Tonight Show hosted by Johnny Carson. The following night, Carson did a comic spoof of his on-air farewell address.  Other activities  Cronkite meets with President Ronald Reagan at the White House, 1981 = Post-CBS Evening News = As he had promised on his last show as anchor in 1981, Cronkite continued to broadcast occasionally as a special correspondent for CBS, CNN, and NPR into the 21st century; one such occasion was Cronkite anchoring the second space flight by John Glenn in 1998 as he had Glenn's first in 1962. In 1983, he reported on the British general election for the ITV current affairs series World In Action, interviewing, among many others, the victorious Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. Cronkite hosted the annual Vienna New Year's Concert on PBS from 1985 to 2008, succeeded by Julie Andrews in 2009. For many years, until 2002, he was also the host of the annual Kennedy Center Honors. In 1998, Cronkite hosted the 90-minute documentary, Silicon Valley: A 100 Year Renaissance, produced by the Santa Clara Valley Historical Association. The film documented Silicon Valley's rise from the origin of Stanford University to the current high-technology powerhouse. The documentary was broadcast on PBS throughout the United States and in 26 countries. Prior to 2004, he could also be seen in the opening movie \\"Back to Neverland\\" shown in the Walt Disney World attraction The Magic of Disney Animation, interviewing Robin Williams as if he is still on the CBS News channel, ending his on-camera time with Cronkite's famous catchphrase. In the feature, Cronkite describes the steps taken in the creation of an animated film, while Robin Williams becomes an animated character (and even becomes Walter Cronkite, impersonating his voice). He also was shown inviting Disney guests and tourists to the Disney Classics Theater. On May 21, 1999, Walter Cronkite participated in a panel discussion on \\"Integrity in the Media\\" with Ben Bradlee and Mike McCurry at the Connecticut Forum in Hartford, Connecticut. Cronkite provided a particularly funny anecdote about taking a picture from a house in Houston, Texas, where a newsworthy event occurred and being praised for getting a unique photograph, only to find out later that the city desk had provided him with the wrong address. = Voice-overs = Cronkite narrated the IMAX film about the Space Shuttle, The Dream is Alive, released in 1985. From May 26, 1986, to August 15, 1994, he was the narrator's voice in the EPCOT Center attraction Spaceship Earth, at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. He provided the pivotal voice of Captain Neweyes in the 1993 animated film We're Back: A Dinosaur's Story, delivering his trademark line at the end. In 1995, he made an appearance on Broadway, providing the voice of the titular book in the 1995 revival of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. Cronkite was a finalist for NASA's Journalist in Space program, which mirrored the Teacher in Space Project, an opportunity that was suspended after the Challenger disaster in 1986. He recorded voice-overs for the 1995 film Apollo 13, modifying the script he was given to make it more \\"Cronkitian.\\" In 2002, Cronkite was the voice of Benjamin Franklin in the educational television cartoon Liberty's Kids, which included a news segment ending with the same phrase he did back on the CBS Evening News. His distinctive voice provided the narration for the television ads of the University of Texas, Austin, his alma mater, with its 'We're Texas' ad campaign. Cronkite voiced Tim's grandpa in the BrainPOP episode about aging. He held amateur radio operator license KB2GSD and narrated a 2003 American Radio Relay League documentary explaining amateur radio's role in disaster relief. The video tells Amateur Radio's public service story to non-hams, focusing on ham radio's part in helping various agencies respond to wildfires in the Western US during 2002, ham radio in space and the role Amateur Radio plays in emergency communications. \\"Dozens of radio amateurs helped the police and fire departments and other emergency services maintain communications in New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC,\\" narrator Cronkite intoned in reference to ham radio's response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Unusually, Cronkite was a Novice-class licensee‚Äîthe entry level license‚Äîfor his entire, and long, tenure in the hobby. On February 15, 2005, he went into the studio at CBS to record narration for WCC Chatham Radio, a documentary about Guglielmo Marconi and his Chatham station, which became the busiest ship-to-shore wireless station in North America from 1914 to 1994. The documentary was directed by Christopher Seufert of Mooncusser Films and premiered at the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center in April 2005. In 2006, Cronkite hosted the World War One Living History Project, a program honoring America's final handful of veterans from the First World War. The program was created by Treehouse Productions and aired on NPR on November 11, 2006. In May 2009, Legacy of War, produced by PBS, was released. Cronkite chronicles, over archive footage, the events following World War II that resulted in America's rise as the dominant world power. Prior to his death, \\"Uncle Walter\\" hosted a number of TV specials and was featured in interviews about the times and events that occurred during his career as America's \\"most trusted\\" man. In July 2006, the 90-minute documentary Walter Cronkite: Witness to History aired on PBS. The special was narrated by Katie Couric, who assumed the CBS Evening News anchor chair in September 2006. Cronkite provided the voiceover introduction to Couric's CBS Evening News, which began on September 5, 2006. Cronkite's voiceover was notably not used on introducing the broadcast reporting his funeral ‚Äì no voiceover was used on this occasion. = TV and movie appearances = Cronkite made a cameo appearance on a 1974 episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, in which he met with Lou Grant in his office. Ted Baxter, who at first tried to convince Cronkite that he (Baxter) was as good a newsman as Eric Sevareid, pleaded with Cronkite to hire him for the network news, at least to give sport scores, and gave an example: \\"The North Stars 3, the Kings Oh!\\" Cronkite turned to Grant and said, \\"I'm gonna get you for this!\\" Cronkite later said that he was disappointed that his scene was filmed in one take, since he had hoped to sit down and chat with the cast. In the late 1980s and again in the 1990s, Cronkite appeared on the news-oriented situation comedy Murphy Brown as himself. Both episodes were written by the Emmy Award-winning team of Tom Seeley and Norm Gunzenhauser. He also continued hosting a variety of series. In the early 1980s, he was host of the documentary series World War II with Walter Cronkite. In 1991, he hosted the TV documentary Dinosaur! on A&E; (not related to the documentary of the same title hosted by Christopher Reeve on CBS six years earlier), and a 1994 follow-up series, Ape Man: The Story of Human Evolution. In 1995, he narrated the World Liberty Concert held in the Netherlands. Cronkite routinely hosted the Kennedy Center Honors from 1981 to 2002. Cronkite appeared briefly in the 2005 dramatic documentary The American Ruling Class written by Lewis Lapham; the 2000 film Thirteen Days reporting on the Cuban Missile Crisis; and provided the opening synopsis of the American Space Program leading to the events in Apollo 13 for the 1995 Ron Howard film of the same name. = Political activism = Walter Cronkite speaks at a NASA ceremony in February 2004 Cronkite wrote a syndicated opinion column for King Features Syndicate. In 2005 and 2006, he contributed to The Huffington Post. Cronkite was the honorary chairman of The Interfaith Alliance.Message From Walter Cronkite, The Interfaith Alliance. Retrieved August 3, 2012. In 2006, he presented the Walter Cronkite Faith and Freedom Award to actor and activist George Clooney on behalf of his organization at its annual dinner in New York. Cronkite was a vocal advocate for free airtime for political candidates. He worked with the Alliance for Better Campaigns and Common Cause, for instance, on an unsuccessful lobbying effort to have an amendment added to the McCain- Feingold-Shays-Meehan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2001 that would have required TV broadcast companies to provide free airtime to candidates. Cronkite criticized the present system of campaign finance which allows elections to \\"be purchased\\" by special interests, and he noted that all the European democracies \\"provide their candidates with extensive free airtime.\\" \\"In fact,\\" Cronkite pointed out, \\"of all the major nations worldwide that profess to have democracies, only seven ‚Äì just seven ‚Äì do not offer free airtime\\" This put the United States on a list with Ecuador, Honduras, Malaysia, Taiwan, Tanzania, and Trinidad and Tobago. Cronkite concluded that \\"The failure to give free airtime for our political campaigns endangers our democracy.\\" During the elections held in 2000, the amount spent by candidates in the major TV markets approached $1 billion. \\"What our campaign asks is that the television industry yield just a tiny percentage of that windfall, less than 1 percent, to fund free airtime.\\" He was a member of the Constitution Project's bipartisan Liberty and Security Committee. He also supported the nonprofit world hunger organization Heifer International. In 1998, he supported President Bill Clinton during Clinton's impeachment trial. He was also a proponent of limited world government on the American federalist model, writing fundraising letters for the World Federalist Association (now Citizens for Global Solutions). In accepting the 1999 Norman Cousins Global Governance Award at the ceremony at the United Nations, Cronkite said: > It seems to many of us that if we are to avoid the eventual catastrophic > world conflict we must strengthen the United Nations as a first step toward > a world government patterned after our own government with a legislature, > executive and judiciary, and police to enforce its international laws and > keep the peace. To do that, of course, we Americans will have to yield up > some of our sovereignty. That would be a bitter pill. It would take a lot of > courage, a lot of faith in the new order. But the American colonies did it > once and brought forth one of the most nearly perfect unions the world has > ever seen. Originally quoted for this book in Walter Cronkite. \\"The Case for > Democratic World Government.\\" Earth Island Journal. Vol. 15, no. 2. Summer > 2000. p. 45. Cronkite contrasted his support for accountable global government with the opposition to it by politically active Christian fundamentalists in the United States: > Even as with the American rejection of the League of Nations, our failure to > live up to our obligations to the United Nations is led by a handful of > willful senators who choose to pursue their narrow, selfish political > objectives at the cost of our nation's conscience.

Their leader, Pat Robertson, has written that we should have a world > government but only when the messiah arrives. Any attempt to achieve world > order before that time must be the work of the Devil! Well join me... I'm > glad to sit here at the right hand of Satan. In 2003, Cronkite, who owned property on Martha's Vineyard, became involved in a long-running debate over his opposition to the construction of a wind farm in that area. In his column, he repeatedly condemned President George W. Bush and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Cronkite appeared in the 2004 Robert Greenwald film Outfoxed, where he offered commentary on what he said were unethical and overtly political practices at the Fox News Channel. Cronkite remarked that when Fox News was founded by Rupert Murdoch, \\"it was intended to be a conservative organization ‚Äì beyond that; a far-right-wing organization\\". In January 2006, during a press conference to promote the PBS documentary about his career, Cronkite said that he felt the same way about America's presence in Iraq as he had about their presence in Vietnam in 1968 and that he felt America should recall its troops. Cronkite spoke out against the War on Drugs in support of the Drug Policy Alliance, writing a fundraising letter and appearing in advertisements on behalf of the DPA. In the letter, Cronkite wrote: \\"Today, our nation is fighting two wars: one abroad and one at home. While the war in Iraq is in the headlines, the other war is still being fought on our own streets. Its casualties are the wasted lives of our own citizens. I am speaking of the war on drugs. And I cannot help but wonder how many more lives, and how much more money, will be wasted before another Robert McNamara admits what is plain for all to see: the war on drugs is a failure.\\"  Personal life  Cronkite at the helm of the in July 1997. Cronkite was married for nearly 65 years to Mary Elizabeth 'Betsy' Maxwell Cronkite, from March 30, 1940, until her death from cancer on March 15, 2005..

Cronkite's funeral took place on July 23, 2009, at St. Bartholomew's Church in midtown Manhattan, New York City. At his funeral, his friends noted his love of music, including, recently, drumming.\\"Friends Recall Walter Cronkite‚Äôs Private Side\\", Brian Stelter, The New York Times, July 23, 2009.  Legacy = Public credibility and trustworthiness = For many years, until a decade after he left his post as anchor, Cronkite was considered one of the most trusted figures in the United States. For most of his 19 years as anchor, he was the \\"predominant news voice in America.\\" Affectionately known as \\"Uncle Walter,\\" he covered many of the important news events of the era so effectively that his image and voice are closely associated with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam War, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and the Watergate scandal. USA Today wrote that \\"few TV figures have ever had as much power as Cronkite did at his height.\\" Enjoying the cult of personality surrounding Cronkite in those years, CBS allowed some good-natured fun-poking at its star anchorman in some episodes of the network's popular situation comedy All in the Family, during which the lead character Archie Bunker would sometimes complain about the newsman, calling him \\"Pinko Cronkite.\\" Cronkite trained himself to speak at a rate of 124 words per minute in his newscasts, so that viewers could clearly understand him. In contrast, Americans average about 165 words per minute, and fast, difficult-to-understand talkers speak close to 200 words per minute.Statement from audiologist Ray Hull, PhD, ray.hull@wichita.edu, quoted in \\"Home Make-Over: How to design an efficient listening environment\\" by Alyssa Banotai, ADVANCE For Speech-Language Pathologists and Audiologists (April 16, 2007), p. 8. = Awards and honors = In 1968, the faculty of the E.

In 1999, Cronkite received the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement's Corona Award in recognition of a lifetime of achievement in space exploration. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. On March 1, 2006, Cronkite became the first non-astronaut to receive NASA's Ambassador of Exploration Award. Among Cronkite's numerous awards were four Peabody awards for excellence in broadcasting. In 2003, Cronkite was honored by the Vienna Philharmonic with the Franz Schalk Gold Medal, in view of his contributions to the New Year's Concert and the cultural image of Austria. = Cronkite School at Arizona State University = The namesake Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication at Arizona State University A few years after Cronkite retired, Tom Chauncey, an owner of KTSP-TV, the then-CBS affiliate in Phoenix, contacted Cronkite, an old friend, and asked him if he would be willing to have the journalism school at Arizona State University named after him. Cronkite immediately agreed. The ASU program acquired status and respect from its namesake. Cronkite was not just a namesake, but he also took the time to interact with the students and staff of the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Cronkite made the trip to Arizona annually to present the Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Journalism to a leader in the field of media. \\"The values that Mr. Cronkite embodies ‚Äì excellence, integrity, accuracy, fairness, objectivity ‚Äì we try to instill in our students each and every day. There is no better role model for our faculty or our students,\\" said Dean Christopher Callahan. The school, with approximately 1,700 students, is widely regarded as one of the top journalism schools in the country. It is housed in a new facility in downtown Phoenix that is equipped with 14 digital newsrooms and computer labs, two TV studios, 280 digital student work stations, the Cronkite Theater, the First Amendment Forum, and new technology. The school's students regularly finish at the top of national collegiate journalism competitions, such as the Hearst Journalism Awards program and the Society of Professional Journalists Mark of Excellence Awards. In 2009, students won the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for college print reporting. In 2008, the state-of-the-art journalism education complex in the heart of ASU's Downtown Phoenix campus was also built in his honor. The Walter Cronkite Regents Chair in Communication seats the Texas College of Communications dean. = Walter Cronkite Papers = The Walter Cronkite papers are preserved at the curatorial Dolph Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas at Austin. Occupying 293 linear feet (almost 90 metres) of shelf space, the papers document Cronkite's journalism career. Amongst the collected material are Cronkite's early beginnings while he still lived in Houston. They encompass his coverage of World War II as a United Press International correspondent, where he cemented his reputation by taking on hazardous overseas assignments. During this time he also covered the Nuremberg war crimes trial serving as the chief of the United Press bureau in Moscow. The main content of the papers documents Cronkite's career with CBS News between 1950 and 1981. The Cronkite Papers assemble a variety of interviews with U.S. presidents, including Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, and Ronald Reagan. President Lyndon Johnson requested a special interview with Cronkite while he was broadcasting live on CBS. Between 1990 and 1993, Don Carleton, executive director for the Center for American History, assisted Cronkite\\"In Memoriam: Walter Cronkite, 1916‚Äì2009\\", Center for American History. Retrieved 2009-07-31. as he compiled an oral history to write his autobiography, A Reporter's Life, which was published in 1996. The taped memoirs became an integral part of an eight-part television series Cronkite Remembers, which was shown on the Discovery Channel. As a newsman, Cronkite devoted his attention to the early days of the space program, and the \\"space race\\" between the United States and the Soviet Union. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration honored Cronkite on February 28, 2006. Michael Coats, director of NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, presented Cronkite with the Ambassador of Exploration Award. Cronkite was the first non- astronaut thus honored. NASA presented Cronkite with a Moon rock sample from the early Apollo expeditions spanning 1969 to 1972. Cronkite passed on the Moon rock to Bill Powers, president of the University of Texas at Austin, and it became part of the collection at the Dolph Briscoe Center for American History. Carleton said at this occasion, \\"We are deeply honored by Walter Cronkite's decision to entrust this prestigious award to the Center for American History. The Center already serves as the proud steward of his professional and personal papers, which include his coverage of the space program for CBS News. It is especially fitting that the archive documenting Walter's distinguished career should also include one of the moon rocks that the heroic astronauts of the Apollo program brought to Earth.\\" = Memorial at Missouri Western State University = On November 4, 2013, Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri, dedicated the Walter Cronkite Memorial. The nearly 6,000 square-foot memorial includes images, videos and memorabilia from Cronkite's life and the many events he covered as a journalist. The memorial includes a replica of the newsroom from which Cronkite broadcast the news during the 1960s and 1970s. In 2014, the Memorial received the Missouri Division of Tourism's Spotlight Award.

He was the anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News for 22 years (1982‚Äì2004). He is the only person to have hosted all three major NBC News programs: The Today Show, NBC Nightly News, and, briefly, Meet the Press. He now serves as a special correspondent for NBC News and works on documentaries for other outlets. Along with his competitors Peter Jennings at ABC News and Dan Rather at CBS News, Brokaw was one of the \\"Big Three\\" news anchors in the U.S. during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. The three hosted their networks' flagship nightly news programs for over 20 years, and all three started and retired from the anchor chair (or died, in Jennings' case) with Dan Rather notably being ousted from CBS due to false reports aired on 60 Minutes II within a year of each other. Brokaw has also written several books on American history and society in the 20th century. He is the author of The Greatest Generation (1998) and other books and the recipient of numerous awards and honors including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which was awarded to him by President Barack Obama in 2014.https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press- office/2014/11/10/president-obama-names-recipients-presidential-medal-freedom  Early life  Brokaw (left) greeting the 20,000th visitor to the Gavins Point Dam in 1958; Brokaw was a tour guide there Brokaw was born in Webster, South Dakota, the son of Eugenia \\"Jean\\" (n√©e Conley; 1917‚Äì2011), who worked in sales and as a post-office clerk, and Anthony Orville \\"Red\\" Brokaw (1912‚Äì1982). He was the eldest of their three sons (Dan and Richard) and named for his maternal great-grandfather, Thomas Conley. His father was a descendant of Huguenot immigrants Bourgon and Catherine (n√©e Le F√®vre) Broucard, and his mother was Irish-American,McGuire, John M. (November 6, 2002). \\"From Yankton to Yankee Town\\". St. Louis Post-Dispatch, p. E1. although the origin of the name Brokaw is contested. His paternal great-grandfather, Richard P.

A Long Way from Home: Growing Up in the American Heartland in the Forties and Fifties, p. 9. New York: Random House. Brokaw's father was a construction foreman for the Army Corps of Engineers. He worked at the Black Hills Ordnance Depot (BHOD) and helped construct Fort Randall Dam; his job often required the family to resettle throughout South Dakota during Brokaw's early childhood.Jordan, Larry (February 1995). \\"Tom Brokaw: A Heavyweight in a World of Lightweights \\". Midwest Today. The Brokaws lived for short periods in Bristol, Igloo (the small residential community of the BHOD), and Pickstown, before settling in Yankton, where Brokaw attended high school. As a high school student attending Yankton Senior High School, Brokaw was governor of South Dakota American Legion Boys State, and in that capacity he accompanied then-South Dakota Governor Joe Foss to New York City for a joint appearance on a TV game show. It was to be the beginning of a long relationship with Foss, whom Brokaw would later feature in his book about World War II veterans, The Greatest Generation. Brokaw also became an Advisory Board member of the Joe Foss Institute. Brokaw matriculated at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, but dropped out after a year as he apparently failed to keep up in his studies, in his words majoring in \\"beer and co-eds\\". In 2010, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University, and he later donated his papers to the University of Iowa Libraries. He joked that the \\"honorary degree is especially coveted because it helps to make up for the uneven (to put it mildly) performance of my freshman year.\\" He received his Bachelor of Arts in Political Science from the University of South Dakota in 1964. For several years, Brokaw mountain climbed with the \\"Do Boys,\\" whose members included Yvon Chouinard and Douglas Tompkins.

In 1973, NBC made Brokaw White House correspondent, covering the Watergate scandal, and anchor of the Saturday editions of Nightly News. He became host of NBC's Today Show in 1976 and remained in the job until 1981. He kept a closely guarded secret for many years, in 2017 Brokaw wrote of having been offered ‚Äì and having promptly turned down ‚Äì the press secretary position in the Nixon White House in 1969. While living in California before Nixon made his political comeback, Brokaw had come to know H. R. 'Bob' Haldeman (White House chief of staff and initiator of the offer) as well as Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, and others members of the White House staff.Brokaw, Tom, \\"The Offer From Nixon I Refused\\" (opinion), Op-ed, The New York Times, February 17, 2017.

After a year, NBC News president Reuven Frank concluded that the dual-anchor program was not working and selected Brokaw to be sole anchor.Frank, Reuven. Out of Thin Air: The Brief Wonderful Life of Network News (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991), pp. 383‚Äì84. The NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw commenced on September 5, 1983. Among other news items, he covered the Challenger disaster, EDSA Revolution, Loma Prieta earthquake, fall of the Berlin Wall and Hurricane Andrew. Brokaw preparing for a live broadcast in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Brokaw scored a major coup when, on November 9, 1989, he was the first English-language broadcast journalist to report the Fall of the Berlin Wall. Brokaw attended a televised press conference organized in East Berlin by G√ºnter Schabowski, press spokesman for East German Politburo, which had just decided to allow its citizens to apply to permanently leave the country through its border with West Germany. When Schabowski was asked when this loosening of regulations would take effect, he glanced through his notes, then said, \\"sofort, unverz√ºglich\\" (\\"immediately, without delay\\"), touching off a stampede of East Berliners to the Wall. Brokaw had an interview with Schabowski after the press conference, who repeated his \\"immediately\\" statement when pressed. Later that evening Brokaw reported from the west side of Brandenburg Gate on this announcement and pandemonium that had broken out in East Berlin because of it. As anchor, Brokaw conducted the first one-on-one American television interviews with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Russian President Vladimir Putin. He and Katie Couric hosted a prime-time newsmagazine, Now, that aired from 1993‚Äì94 before being folded into the multi- night Dateline NBC program. Also, in 1993, on the first broadcast of Late Show with David Letterman on CBS, in response to David Letterman's monologue containing jokes about NBC, Brokaw walked on stage in a surprise cameo (accompanied by Paul Shaffer and the CBS Orchestra playing the NBC Nightly News theme). He congratulated Letterman on his new show and wished him well, but also stated he was disappointed and shocked; he subsequently walked over to the man holding the cue cards, took two, and remarked, \\"These last two jokes are the intellectual property of NBC!\\", leaving the stage afterwards. Letterman then remarked, \\"Who would have thought you would ever hear the words 'intellectual property' and 'NBC' in the same sentence?\\" Richard Jewell sued NBC News for this statement, made by Brokaw about the 1996 Olympic Park bombing, \\"The speculation is that the FBI is close to making the case. They probably have enough to arrest [Jewell] right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but you always want to have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case.\\" Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000. Brokaw with Vladimir Putin before an interview on June 2, 2000. On September 11, 2001, Brokaw joined Katie Couric and Matt Lauer around 9:30 a.m., following the live attack on the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and continued to anchor all day, until after midnight. Following the collapse of the second tower, Brokaw observed: \\"This is war. This is a declaration and an execution of an attack on the United States.\\" He continued to anchor coverage to midnight on the following two days. Later that month, a letter containing anthrax was addressed to him as part of the 2001 anthrax attacks. Brokaw was not harmed, but two NBC News employees were infected. In 2008, he testified before the Commission on Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism about the anthrax attacks, publicly discussing his experiences for the first time in a detailed, day-by-day account. In 2002, NBC announced that Brokaw would retire as anchor of the NBC Nightly News following the 2004 Presidential election, to be succeeded by Brian Williams. Brokaw would remain with NBC News in a part-time capacity from that point onwards, serving as an analyst and anchoring and producing documentary programs. Brokaw closed his final Nightly News broadcast in front of 15.7 million viewers on NBC on December 1, 2004, by saying: By the end of his time as Nightly News anchor, Brokaw was regarded as the most popular news personality in the United States. Nightly News had moved into first place in the Nielsen ratings in late 1996 and held on to the spot for the remainder of Brokaw's tenure on the program, placing him ahead of ABC's Peter Jennings and World News Tonight, and CBS's Dan Rather and the CBS Evening News. Along with Jennings and Rather, Brokaw helped usher in the era of the TV news anchor as a lavishly compensated, globe-trotting star in the 1980s. The magnitude of a news event could be measured by whether Brokaw and his counterparts on the other two networks showed up on the scene. Brokaw's retirement in December 2004, followed by Rather's ousting from the CBS Evening News in March 2005, and Jennings's death in August 2005, brought that era to a close. = 2004-present: After Nightly News = Brokaw in 2006 speaking about the attack on Pearl Harbor. After leaving the anchor chair, Brokaw remained at NBC as Special Correspondent, providing periodic reports for Nightly News. He served as an NBC analyst during the 2008 presidential election campaign and moderated the second presidential debate between Barack Obama and John McCain at Belmont University. He reported documentaries for the Discovery Channel and the History Channel and in 2006 delivered one of the eulogies during the state funeral of former President Gerald R. Ford. On June 13, 2008, when NBC interrupted its regular programming to announce the sudden death of NBC News Washington Bureau Chief and Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert, Brokaw served as the announcer. A week later, NBC announced that Brokaw would serve as host of Meet the Press on an interim basis. He was succeeded by David Gregory in December 2008. Brokaw serves on the board of directors of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the International Rescue Committee and the Mayo Clinic. He is also a member of the Howard University School of Communications Board of Visitors and a trustee of the University of South Dakota, the Norton Simon Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the International Rescue Committee. He also provides the voiceover for a University of Iowa advertisement that airs on television during Iowa Hawkeyes athletic events. In 2011 Brokaw began hosting The Boys in the Hall, a baseball documentary series for Fox Sports Net. In December 2012, Brokaw starred in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's annual Christmas concert, with live audiences of 84,000. The concert, titled Home for the Holidays, was nationally televised in December 2013. In April 2014, a new broadcast facility opened on the Universal Studios Hollywood lot, and named in Brokaw's honor as the Brokaw News Center. The facility houses KNBC-TV, Telemundo owned-and- operated station KVEA, and the Los Angeles bureau of NBC News. In November 2014, President Barack Obama presented Brokaw with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, American's highest civilian honor. He received the honor with the citation, \\"The chronicler of the Greatest Generation...we celebrate him as one of our nation‚Äôs greatest journalists\\". On March 11, 2016, Brokaw gave one of the eulogies for former First Lady Nancy Reagan at her funeral. He spoke about his relationship with both the Reagans as a reporter and later anchor.https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/nancy-reagan-honored-funeral- memories-laughter-tears-n536831  Personal life  Since 1962, Brokaw has been married to author Meredith Lynn Auld. They have three daughters: Jennifer, Andrea, and Sarah. Brokaw and his wife spend considerable time at their ranch near Livingston, Montana, which they bought in 1989. On September 6, 2012, Brokaw was hospitalized after appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe. He later tweeted that he was \\"all well\\" and explained his illness as having accidentally taken half a dose of Ambien in the morning. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a treatable but incurable blood cancer, in August 2013 at the Mayo Clinic. Brokaw and his physicians are \\"very encouraged with his progress\\". He has continued to work for NBC throughout his treatments. On December 21, 2014, Brokaw announced that his cancer is in full remission.

Wire removal can be partly automated through various forms of keying, or each frame can be edited manually. First, the live action plates of actors or models suspended on wires are filmed in front of a green screen. Editors can then erase the wires frame by frame, without worrying about erasing the backdrop, which will be added later. This can be accomplished automatically with a computer. If the sequence is not filmed in front of a green-screen, or with a green wire a digital editor must hand-paint the lines out. This can be an arduous task. The modern technique of wire removal was pioneered by Industrial Light and Magic, when they used it in films such as Howard the Duck (1986), Back to the Future Part II (1989), and Hook (1991).

John Sweet; Esmond Knight provided narration and played two small roles. For the post-war American release, Raymond Massey narrated and Kim Hunter was added to the film. The film was made in black and white, and was the first of two collaborations between Powell and Pressburger and cinematographer Erwin Hillier. Much of the film's visual style is a mixture of British realism and Hillier's German Expressionist style that is harnessed through a neo-romantic sense of the English landscape. The concept that 'the past always haunts the present' in the English landscape was already part of English literary culture, e.g. in works by Rudyard Kipling such as Puck of Pook's Hill, and would become a notable trope for British novelists and film-makers from the 1960s. A Canterbury Tale takes its title from The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer and loosely uses Chaucer's theme of \\"eccentric characters on a religious pilgrimage\\" to highlight the wartime experiences of the citizens of Kent and encourage wartime Anglo-American friendship and understanding. Anglo- American relations were also explored in Powell and Pressburger's previous film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and in more detail in their subsequent film A Matter of Life and Death. Plot St George's Church tower, seen in the film after being gutted in the Baedeker raids (modern photograph) The story concerns three young people: British Army Sergeant Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), U.S. Army Sergeant Bob Johnson (played by real-life Sergeant John Sweet), and a \\"Land Girl\\", Miss Alison Smith (Sheila Sim). The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement \\"next stop Canterbury\\" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform, who pours glue on her hair before escaping. It transpires that this has happened to other women, and the mystery attacker is known locally as \\"the glue man\\". Alison asks Bob if he will spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several small boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and steals the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson's boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper. The dates of the attacks correspond with Colpeper's night watches, for which he wore a Home Guard uniform kept in the town hall. On their train journey to Canterbury on the Monday morning, Colpeper joins the three in their compartment. They confront him with their suspicions, which he does not deny, and they discover that his motive is to prevent the soldiers from being distracted from his lectures by female company, as well as to help keep the local women faithful to their absent British boyfriends. In Colpeper's words, Chaucer's pilgrims travelled to Canterbury to \\"receive a blessing or to do penance\\". On arriving in the city of Canterbury, devastated by wartime bombing, all three young people receive blessings of their own. Alison discovers that her boyfriend, believed killed in the war, has survived after all; his father, who had blocked their marriage because he thought his son could do better than a shopgirl, finally relents. Bob receives long-delayed letters from his sweetheart, who is now a WAC in Australia. Peter, a cinema organist before the war, gets to play the music of Johann Sebastian Bach on the large organ at Canterbury Cathedral, before leaving with his unit. He decides not to report Colpeper to the Canterbury police, as he had planned to do. Cast Gibbs, Johnson and Smith The Seven Sisters Soldier is standing behind Peter & Bob and Sergt. 'Stuffy' (Graham Moffatt) is asleep * Eric Portman as Thomas Colpeper, a gentleman farmer and magistrate in Chillingbourne. He is a bachelor, living with his mother and, being very keen on the local history of the area, wants to share that knowledge with everyone around him, particularly with the soldiers from elsewhere in Britain who have been billeted nearby. * Sgt. John Sweet, U.S. Army as Acting Sgt. Bob Johnson, ASN 31036062, hails from Three Sisters Falls, Oregon. On his way from Salisbury to Canterbury to meet his friend and fulfil a promise to his mother to see Canterbury Cathedral, he gets off the train at Chillingbourne (filmed at Selling railway station between Faversham and Canterbury) by mistake and almost immediately gets caught up in the mystery of the \\"glue man\\". He has come to Britain as a part of the American Army preparing for the invasion of Europe. He becomes more and more willing to learn something about England during his visit. The original script mentioned that Johnson was on his way to Canterbury as his ancestors had come from there. The producers had originally planned to use Burgess Meredith in the role but changed their mind in favour of an unknown. Meredith acted as a script editor for Johnson's character. * Dennis Price as Sgt Peter Gibbs, a cinema organist from London. He has been conscripted into the British Army and has just been stationed at the military camp outside Chillingbourne, where his unit is engaged in training manoeuvres. * Sheila Sim as Alison Smith, a shop assistant in a department store in London. She has joined the Women's Land Army to \\"do her bit\\" to help in the defence of her country. She has been assigned to the farm of Thomas Colpeper, the local JP in Chillingbourne. Alison had previously spent a happy summer just outside Chillingbourne, living in a caravan with her fianc√©, an archaeologist who has since joined the RAF and is missing in action at the outset of the film. (He is reported at the end as alive and in Gibraltar). Alison is determined to solve the mystery of the \\"glue man\\" and seeks the help of Bob Johnson to do so. Johnson replies \\"You need about as much help as a Flying Fortress\\". * Charles Hawtrey as Thomas Duckett, the town's stationmaster. * Esmond Knight as Narrator/Seven-Sisters Soldier/Village Idiot. The Narrator reads the modernised extract from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, followed by a piece in Chaucerian style on the changes to Kent since Chaucer's time (both only in the original version). * George Merritt as Ned Horton and Edward Rigby as Jim Horton, play the blacksmith and the wheelwright. The real Horton brothers, Ben and Neville, are seen acting as assistants to the actors. * Freda Jackson as Mrs Honeywood, the farming woman who employs Alison. * Eliot Makeham as the church organist in Canterbury. * Betty Jardine as Fee Baker. * Harvey Golden as Sgt Roczinsky, Bob Johnson's friend in Canterbury. * Leonard Smith, James Tamsitt and David Todd, play among the group of boys enjoying an adventure and river battle in a bucolic setting. All of them were local to the Canterbury area. Smith, Tamsitt and Todd were selected for speaking roles. * Kim Hunter as Johnson's Girl (American release). * Raymond Massey as Narrator (American version) (voice). Production=Writing= Powell and Pressburger, who were known collectivity as \\"The Archers\\", wrote the script together using the concept of light and time as a basis of identity. Powell was said to have used the work of Chaucer as inspiration to create a film that showed \\"the love of his birthplace and all that he felt about England\\". =Casting= All three leads were unknowns. Many local people, including a lot of young boys, were recruited as extras for the extensive scenes of children's outdoor activities such as river \\"battles\\" and dens. =Filming= The film was shot throughout the county of Kent not long after the Baedeker raids of May‚ÄìJune 1942 which had destroyed large areas of the city centre of Canterbury. Much of the film is shot on location in and around Canterbury Cathedral and the city's bomb sites, including the High Street, Rose Lane and the Buttermarket. The cathedral was not available for filming as the stained glass had been taken down, the windows boarded up and the organ, an important location for the story, removed to storage, all for protection against air raids. By the use of clever perspective, large portions of the cathedral were recreated within the studio by art director Alfred Junge. Chilham Mill features in the film in the scene where GI Bob meets children playing in the river on a boat and later, with Peter, when they get the proof about Colpeper. The village was used for scenes showing Chillingbourne village. In the scene where soldiers gather for a lecture at the Colpepper Institute they are actually in Fordwich. Selling Station appears in the film as \\"Chillingbourne\\" Station at the beginning of the film. Bob and Alison ride on a cart through the village, the local Wickhambreaux Mill can be clearly seen. Colpeper's house was Wickhambreaux Court. A local Wingham village pub \\"The Red Lion\\" was used for some exterior shots of \\"The Hand of Glory\\" inn where Bob stays whilst in the village. Other exterior shots of \\"The Hand of Glory\\" were filmed at \\"The George & Dragon\\", Fordwich. Before the credits, the following acknowledgement appears over an image of the cathedral viewed from the Christ Church Gate, Soundtrack Besides that composed by Allan Gray for the film, musical works featured include: * Angelus ad Virginem mid-15th century polyphony heard as a peal of bells in orchestral guise under the opening titles * Commando Patrol by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley ‚Äì quickstep heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs's scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory * I See You Everywhere by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley ‚Äì slow foxtrot heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs's scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory * Turkey in the Straw ‚Äì folksong heard as Agnes leaves Bob's bedroom * Come to the Church in the Wild Wood ‚Äì Bob sings as he washes * Hear my prayer, O Lord by Henry Purcell ‚Äì the ethereal choral music heard as Gibbs pauses on entering the cathedral * Bond of Friendship ‚Äì Regimental March of the King's Division.

A Canterbury Tale ‚Äì Memories of a Classic Wartime Movie. Canterbury: Tritton Publications, August 2000. . With the war over Powell was forced by the studio to completely re-edit the film for the U.S. release, cutting over 20 minutes to make the film shorter and faster moving, adding narration by Raymond Massey, and filming \\"bookends\\" which introduced Kim Hunter as Sergeant Johnson's girlfriend to make the film more contemporary. At the time of filming, Hunter and Massey were preparing to film A Matter of Life and Death for Powell. Powell filmed Hunter's sequences with Sweet on an English set simulating New York City where the couple, now married, presented the film as a flashback similar to the openings of The Way to the Stars and 12 O'Clock High. Sweet was actually filmed in New York with the sequences combined. The film was fully restored by the British Film Institute in the late 1970s and the new print was hailed as a masterwork of British cinema. It has since been reissued on DVD in both the UK and USA. Legacy There is now an annual festival based around the film in which film fans tour the film's locations.Location walks The theme of the film was used by Spike Milligan for the Goon Show The Phantom Head Shaver of Brighton in 1954. The film was shown in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 19 September 2007 to help raise money for the cathedral restoration fund.BBC Kent In May 2014 the film was shown in Chilham village hall to help raise money for the restoration of its war memorial. The screening, which took place in village where the film was made, coincided with the 70th anniversary of the film's premi√®re in Canterbury. Several video artists have recut the more visionary sections of the film as video art.

It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, about 9 km west of Alkmaar. Egmond aan Zee was a separate municipality until 1978, when it merged with Egmond-Binnen and Egmond aan den Hoef to form the new municipality Egmond. In turn, Egmond was amalgamated into Bergen on 1 January 2001. History ¬´The beach at Egmond aan Zee¬ª by Cornelis Beelt, 1602-1612 Beach erosion at Egmond over the centuries left This best-known of the three villages of Egmond was formed in the coastal dunes in 977. Settlers in this area have battled the sea since the first settlements. During the All Saints' Flood of 1570, some 50 houses disappeared into the sea. And in November 1741, the sea swallowed 36 houses, the church, and its tower. Apart from being dangerous, the sea also provided the people of Egmond food and work, as most inhabitants of Egmond were fishermen. Quite a few sights in Egmond remind one of this; for instance, the \\"fishermen-houses\\", which are tiny houses near the sea where fishermen used to live. Another sight is a fishermen monument and the \\"Prins Hendrik Stichting\\", a stately building named after a Dutch prince that used to house retired fishermen. The Egmond museum paints a picture of what living in Egmond used to be like. Egmond aan Zee has been a popular seaside resort since the beginning of the 20th century, when it was well known for its healthy and clear sea air. Children came over to stay in one of the many \\"koloniehuizen\\" (colony houses), which were sanatorium-like institutions often run by charities and churches. The center of attention in Egmond is certainly the Jan van Speijk Lighthouse, built in 1834 and named after Dutch sea captain Jan van Speijk. The rural Dutch villages of Egmond aan Zee, Egmond aan den Hoef, and Egmond Binnen played host to a small artists' colony beginning in 1881 when the American artist George Hitchcock settled there. Walter MacEwen, also American, painted there from 1883 to 1885. Another American, Gari Melchers, arrived in 1884. Melchers continued there for 25 years, recording the people and the rural environment. See Joseph G. Dreiss, Gari Melchers; His Works in the Belmont Collection, Charlottesville, University Press of Virginia, 1984, pp. 11ff. Statistics In 2001, the town of Egmond aan Zee had 5086 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.85 km¬≤, and contained 2490 residences.Statistics Netherlands (CBS), Bevolkingskernen in Nederland 2001 . Statistics are for the continuous built- up area. Events The Egmond Half Marathon (Dutch: Egmond Halve Marathon) is an annual half marathon race over 21.1 kilometres that has been staged since 1973. The competition normally takes place in early January. Sections of the road race cross along the beach and sand dunes of the village, situated on the North Sea coast. The 2010 edition of the race was cancelled due to poor weather conditions, marking the first break in the race's history.van Hemert, Wim (2011-01-10).

From 1995, Egmond aan Zee has hosted the Finder Darts Masters, a yearly major darts tournament that features players for the British Darts Organisation circuit, and formally sanctioned by the World Darts Federation. It is usually held in December, at the Hotel Zuiderduin, and is traditionally the last tournament held before the World Championship.

It is a part of the municipality of Bergen, and lies about 8 km northwest of Alkmaar. Until 2001, Schoorl was also a municipality of its own. Schoorl is a village in between the polder area of North Holland and the Kennemer dunes. The village is about 8 km (5mls) long and never wider than 2 km (1mls). The village is heavily protected by the highest and widest dunes of the Netherlands, which reach about 54 m (164 ft) above sealevel right behind the center of Schoorl, and are more than 5 km (3mls) wide. Schoorl is a major local tourism location in the summer and counts over 25 campsites, the largest concentration of campsites in the Netherlands. Raadhuisje Schoorl The village, earlier named Scorel contains evidence of a long history in the form of two raadhuisjes (town hall) aging from 1600. The Dutch painter and evangelist Jan van Scorel was born here. Meidenmarkt is the most renowned yearly festivity that is celebrated once a year on the second day (Monday) of pentecost (see also this list of dates to see when Pentecost begins). The celebration is a 100-year-old tradition where the local youngsters can meet partners of the opposite sex. The celebration takes place on the klimduin in the center of town. This klimduin is a century old attraction and many Dutch people have visited it as part of a school trip. During World War II, Kamp Schoorl was a concentration camp originally built as a Dutch army camp.

Adi Godrej in the background. Recipient and donors in \\"convocation dress\\". Graduation is the award of a diploma or academic degree, or the ceremony that is sometimes associated with it, in which students become graduates. The date of graduation is often called graduation day. The graduation ceremony itself is also sometimes called: commencement, convocation or invocation. Graduation ceremony Usually the ceremony and name apply to university degrees (Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral degrees). In a graduation ceremony at the college and university level, the presiding officer or another authorized person formally confers degrees upon candidates, either individually or en masse, even though graduates may physically receive their diploma later at a smaller college or departmental ceremony. Ceremonies often include a procession of some of the academic staff and candidates and a valediction. The academic staff will usually wear an academic dress at the ceremony, as will the trustees (if applicable) and the degree candidates. Graduates can be referred to by their year of graduation. =Graduation in absentia= When a student graduates without attending the graduation ceremony, then it is called graduation in absentia. =United States (non- tertiary \\"graduations\\")= In the United States, the completion of mandatory schooling is also referred to as graduating, even though it is substantially below degree level. \\"Graduations\\" for elementary school and kindergartens, and even for passing from one school year to the next, have been a development of recent years. This has received criticism, being described as \\"just a way of celebrating mediocrity\\". In some places, graduation parties celebrating graduation from school, college or university are popular. In a recent 2014 nationwide survey in the United States, $985 was the average amount spent on graduation parties. By country The procedures and traditions surrounding academic graduation ceremonies differ around the world. Whereas in the United Kingdom a graduation usually only occurs at university level, in the United States of America and many other countries graduations also occur at high schools where no higher education qualifications are conferred upon the graduates. In a graduation ceremony the students wear formal academic dress, such as square academic caps and gowns that are used for such occasions. Graduation traditions vary across universities observing different cultures. For example, most universities in Sweden are research-oriented and may present their students with bachelor's, master's, and doctor's degrees covering all academic streams. Universities across the country are based through the Higher Education Ordinance. Most of the national programs provide Swedish, English, Math and Science among degree courses. In Zimbabwe, graduation ceremonies are often associated with the guest of honor who most often is the ceremonial head of the institution. At state universities the President of Zimbabwe officiates as chancellor and guest of honor. Every graduate of a state university in Zimbabwe can claim to have shaken the President's hand. The person most associated with graduation at those institutions is Zimbabwe's late ex- President Robert Mugabe. At other State Institutions of higher learning the vice Presidents or any other Senior Government officials may preside. History of graduation Ceremonies for graduating students date from the first universities in Europe in the twelfth century. At that time Latin was the language of scholarship. A universitas was a guild of masters (such as MAs) with licence to teach. \\"Degree\\" and \\"graduate\\" come from gradus, meaning \\"step\\". The first step was admission to a bachelor's degree. The second step was the masters step, giving the graduate admission to the universitas and license to teach. Typical dress for graduation is gown and hood, or hats adapted from the daily dress of university staff in the Middle Ages, which was in turn based on the attire worn by medieval clergy. The tradition of wearing graduation hats in Sweden has been in place since the mid-eighteenth century. The cap is typically a white sailor hat with a black or dark blue band around it, a crown motif, and a black peak at the front. The graduation hat tradition was initially adopted by students at Uppsala University. The headgear then became popular across several other European nations as well.

Because of Arkarua's pentamerous symmetry, it is tentatively placed within phylum Echinodermata. Because of its flattened disk- or button-shape, coupled with its pentamerous symmetry, some claim that it can be further classified into the Edrioasteroidea, a class of the echinoderms. This identification remains suspect, as the fossils do not appear to have either madreporites, or plates of stereom, a unique crystalline form of calcium carbonate from which echinoderm skeletons are built. These two features are diagnostic of all other echinoderms, as all extinct and extant echinoderms have either one, the other, or both features present.Paul D. Taylor, David N.

The word may be of Etruscan origin, via the Latin caerimonia. Church and Civil (secular) Ceremonies According to Dally Messenger and Alain de Botton, in most Western countries the values and ideals articulated in both church and civil ceremonies are generally similar. The difference is in what Messenger calls the \\"supernatural infrastructure\\" or de Botton the \\"implausible supernatural element\\".Messenger, Dally, Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), 2012 Kelly, Fran; Radio Interview with Alain de Botton, RN Breakfast, Australian Broadcasting Commission, Podcast 2012. Most churches and religions claim some extra advantage conferred by the deity e.g. Roman Catholics believe that through the words of consecration in the mass ceremony, God himself becomes actually present on the altar. Both church and civil ceremonies share the powerful psychological, social and cultural influences which all ceremony seeks to attain. Obviously, the style of music played, words used, other components and the structure vary. Shared Traditions: Church and Civil Ceremonies Leaders welcome a boy into Scouting, March 2010, Mexico City, Mexico.As Edward Schillebeeckx writes about the marriage ceremony, there are a surprising number of ancient traditional elements in both church and civil ceremonies in the western world. Key ceremonies date from the pre-Christian Roman and Greek times and their practices have continued through the centuries. For example, from pre-Christian Roman times in the marriage ceremony, we inherit best men and bridesmaids, processions, signing of the contract, exchange of rings and even the wedding cake.

De Botton, Alain: Religion for Atheists: A Non- believer's Guide to the Uses of Religion, 2013, Vintage Books, 2013, Messenger agrees, and points out that the success of civil celebrants in Australia has been partly due to their espousing of these principles, both in theory and practice, since 1973. Messenger, Dally; Alain de Botton and Humanists, Australian Humanist Magazine, no. 106, Winter 2012, p10 Messenger III, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), History of Secular Ceremony The main impetus to the development of quality civil ceremonies in the Western world was the foresight of the Australian statesman, Senator and High Court Judge, Lionel Murphy. In 1973 in Australia the civil celebrant program entrusted appropriately selected individuals to provide non-church people with ceremonies of substance and dignity. This initiative to a great extent has now been followed by New Zealand, Canada, the United Kingdom and some states of the USA.Messenger, Dally (2012), Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), Senator and Mr Justice Lionel Murphy, founder of the civil celebrant movement in Australia, which has now spread to the rest of the Western World Purpose of Secular Ceremony According to Dally Messenger III secular ceremonies are ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù influences which lead to an acceptable, ethical and dignified life. Ceremonies contribute to the unseen ingredients of psychological stability, a sense of identity, reassurances of life's purposes, and the personal sense of self worth. The mysterious cultural power of quality ceremonies lead our society along an honourable and ethical path. Lionel Murphy considered that personal genuine ceremonies were central to a civilised, stable and happy society. Here he echoed the conviction of the renowned mythologist Joseph Campbell who had maintained the strongly asserted generality that the level of civilised behaviour in a society is directly linked to the practice of ceremonies and Rites of Passage. Messenger III, Dally, We Had a Dream, in the Australian Humanist, no 121, Autumn 2016, published by the Australian Humanist Society, Canberra ACT Ceremony is serious communication Ceremonies are the time and place setting wherein people seriously communicate. For example, in front of witnesses the groom tells the bride that he loves her and wants to be with her for the rest of his life. Such a statement has much more force than if said privately. It is in the ceremony that groups of people come together. It is in the ceremony that they make compacts, that they recognise achievement, that they assert identity, that they established connections, that they declare love, that they pay tribute, that they express grief. In addition Messenger makes the following observations: * A complex of good ceremonies raise the level of human happiness in society. * Ceremonies assist humans to adjust to change. * Ceremonies are signposts of the culture and indicate that such a culture has life-affirming substance. * Ceremonies are an important means of expressing, reinforcing and transmitting values. * Ceremonies are constructed from the visual and performing arts. In a chosen setting they are an important vehicle for telling stories, reciting great poetry and prose, using symbolism, and performing great music. * Ceremonies, done well, leave lifelong lasting memories and therefore permanent good effects. * The better a ceremony is done, the better its psychological, cultural, and social outcomes.Messenger, Dally, Murphy's Law and the Pursuit of Happiness: a History of the Civil Celebrant Movement, Spectrum Publications, Melbourne (Australia), pp1-8 2012 The components of ceremony To be powerful and effective, such ceremonies, in the view of all the scholars in the field, had to have impact. This occurred when the ceremony was framed by the visual and performing arts. Great care had to be taken in creating and choosing the poetry, prose, stories, personal journeys, myths, silences, dance, music and song, shared meditations, choreography and symbolism which comprised a ceremony. To reinforce the psychological and cultural power of ceremony it should be enacted, as fas as possible, in a beautiful interior and exterior place. Beauty is the essential core of ceremony, having always been part of ‚Äúraising the spirit‚Äù and embedding the good in the memory. Ceremonies, as they always had been, are historically the bridge between the visual and performing arts and the people. Murphy and his followers, and international practitioners such as David Oldfield of Washington DC understand that ceremonies are core expressions of the culture. Done well, they can assist in major decision making, bring emotional security, strengthen bonds between people, and communicate a sense of contentment. To quote David Oldfield Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz salutes Yom Kippur War casualties at an official annual memorial service. > Rituals and ceremonies are an essential and basic means for human beings to > give themselves and others the necessary messages which enable the > individual to stay human.

The civil celebrant needs to have a rich skill-set and knowledge base. Murphy is on the record as asserting that the civil celebrant needed to have a ‚Äúfeel‚Äù for ceremony and be professional, knowledgeable, educated, creative, imaginative, inspired, well presented, idealistic, and well practised. The civil celebrant should be a person inspired to improve lives at a deep and lasting level. For this reason must be carefully chosen. The ideal is that they be educated in the humanities and trained to expertly co-create, creatively write and perform ceremonies.Messenger III, Dally (1999), Ceremonies and Celebrations, Hachette -Livre Australia (Sydney), pp. 16ff Ceremonial occasions Gogo tribe ladies from Manyoni Tanzania waiting to perform traditional dance during the ceremony of priest Joseph Makasi ordination * marriage, or a wedding, is the flagship ceremony of every culture. * Almost as important is the funeral or burial ceremony. > The funeral ritual, too, is a public, traditional and symbolic means of > expressing our beliefs, thoughts and feelings about the death of someone > loved.

For electoral purposes it comprises North Werrington and South Werrington wards. Werrington spans an area of two and a half square miles (6 km¬≤) and has a population of 14,800. Originally a village, Werrington was engulfed by Peterborough in the mid 20th century, as the city expanded. The area is on the northern edge of the conurbation, approximately four miles (6.4 km) from the city centre. There are two distinct areas of Werrington, the village and new Werrington. The village dates from older periods and focuses on the village green. The new Werrington area focuses on the Werrington Centre, a small shopping complex featuring stores for basic needs.  Shopping  Werrington Centre shops include Tesco, Age Concern and other small shops. These shops have undergone change since 2004 as a result of bigger companies buying out the locally owned shops. The video rental shop changed to a tanning salon but due to business failure has become a Domino's Pizza take-away, the hardware store 'Ostlers' has been replaced by a chemist. Other small stores are a family-run fish and chip shop (which sells Gluten Free fish and chips on the first Monday of each month), dry cleaners, hair salon and barber's and a betting shop. The police station has now closed and is available to rent. The development of Werrington continues, with new residential accommodation in the northernmost part of the area. The shopping centre redevelopment has now been abandoned by Tesco with many small units available for rent or are boarded up. There is a real ale pub next to Tesco.  Activities  Werrington has held a summer carnival and bonfire and fireworks display every year since the 1970s. At the bonfire, two people made out of clay are set on fire, made by volunteers from the local Scout and Guide Association in conjunction with Werrington Primary School. Werrington Village Cricket Club plays in the local Huntingdonshire leagues throughout the summer and plays its home games at nearby Campbell Drive sports fields. Werrington Badminton Club has 100 members ranging from beginners up to county level who play in tournaments around the city and county. They also run two men's and a mixed team in the Hunts league.  Local schools  New Werrington contains three schools. William Law and Welbourne are both primary schools. Ken Stimpson Community School is the only secondary school in the area. Ken Stimpson Community School is a public secondary school which opened in 1982. The school has about 1,100 pupils from years 7 to post-16 (Years 12/13). The school acquired Business and Enterprise College Specialist school status in late 2004. Werrington Primary School is the only school in the original village. It is in the top five for most rankings for primary schools in Peterborough.BBC Primary School League Table for Peterborough: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/education/06/school_tables/primary_schools/html/874.stm The school was founded at the end of the 19th century on the site of what is now the village centre as a Church of England school. The junior school moved to its current site in 1961, followed by the infant school in 1966. The junior and infant schools have merged and share a common administration, the current Werrington Primary School (as it is now referred to) has four houses: Bishop, Church, Mill and Orchard. The KS1 children wear white tops, and black/grey trousers/skirts. The KS2 children wear Yellow and Black ties with a white shirt and black trousers/skirts, the children then usually go onto Ken Stimpson Community School for their secondary education.

According to Piaget's theory of cognitive development, childhood consists of two stages: preoperational stage and concrete operational stage. In developmental psychology, childhood is divided up into the developmental stages of early childhood (preschool age), middle childhood (school age), and adolescence (puberty to legal adulthood). Various childhood factors could affect a person's attitude formation. The concept of childhood emerged during the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly through the educational theories of the philosopher John Locke and the growth of books for and about children. Previous to this point, children were often seen as incomplete versions of adults. Time span, age ranges The term childhood is non-specific in its time span and can imply a varying range of years in human development. It may refer to the period between infancy and adulthood, or the time span from birth to puberty. In the legal systems of many countries, there is an age of majority when childhood legally ends and a person legally becomes an adult, which ranges anywhere from 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common. A global consensus on the terms of childhood is the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC).UNICEF The State of the World‚Äôs Children, 2005 Childhood expectancy indicates the time span, which a child has to experience childhood.End of Childhood Report 2017 Save the Children, retrieved 12 August 2017 Eight life events described as \\"childhood enders\\" by Save the Children are death, extreme malnourishment, extreme violence, conflict forcing displacement, children being out of school, child labor, children having children, and child marriage.  Developmental stages of childhood = Early childhood = Children playing the violin in a group recital, Ithaca, New York, 2011 Children in Madagascar, 2011 Child playing piano, 1984 Early childhood follows the infancy stage and begins with toddlerhood when the child begins speaking or taking steps independently. While toddlerhood ends around age 3 when the child becomes less dependent on parental assistance for basic needs, early childhood continues approximately until the age of 7. However, according to the National Association for the Education of Young Children, early childhood also includes infancy. At this stage children are learning through observing, experimenting and communicating with others. Adults supervise and support the development process of the child, which then will lead to the child's autonomy. Also during this stage, a strong emotional bond is created between the child and the care providers. The children also start preschool and kindergarten at this age: and hence their social lives. = Middle childhood = Middle childhood begins at around age 7, approximating primary school age. It ends with puberty (around age 12 or 13), which typically marks the beginning of adolescence. In this period, children develop socially and mentally. They are at a stage where they make new friends and gain new skills, which will enable them to become more independent and enhance their individuality. During middle childhood, children enter the school years, where they are presented with a different setting than they are used to. This new setting creates new challenges and faces for children. Upon the entrance of school, mental disorders that would normally not be noticed come to light. Many of these disorders include: autism, dyslexia, dyscalculia, and ADHD. Special education, least restrictive environment, response to intervention and individualized education plans are all specialized plans to help children with disabilities. Middle childhood is the time when children begin to understand responsibility and are beginning to be shaped by their peers and parents. Chores and more responsible decisions come at this time, and so does social comparison. Along with social comparison comes social play. With social play comes learning and teaching. During social play, children learn from and teach each other, often through observation. = Adolescence = Adolescence is usually determined to be between the onset of puberty and legal adulthood: mostly corresponding to the teenage years (13-19). However, puberty usually begins before the teenage years. Adolescence is accepted by some cultures as a part of social childhood, because most adolescents are considered minors under the law. The onset of adolescence brings about various physical, psychological and behavioral changes. The end of adolescence and the beginning of adulthood varies by country and by function, and even within a single nation-state or culture there may be different ages at which an individual is considered to be mature enough to be entrusted by society with certain tasks.  History  Playing Children, by Song Dynasty Chinese artist Su Hanchen, c. 1150 AD. During the European Renaissance, artistic depictions of children increased dramatically, which did not affect the social attitude to children much, however. During the 1600s, the concept of childhood began to emerge in Europe. Adults saw children as separate beings, innocent and in need of protection and training by the adults around them. The English philosopher John Locke was particularly influential in defining this new attitude towards children, especially with regard to his theory of the tabula rasa, which considered the mind at birth to be a \\"blank slate\\". A corollary of this doctrine was that the mind of the child was born blank, and that it was the duty of the parents to imbue the child with correct notions. During the early period of capitalism, the rise of a large, commercial middle class, mainly in the Protestant countries of the Dutch Republic and England, brought about a new family ideology centred around the upbringing of children. Puritanism stressed the importance of individual salvation and concern for the spiritual welfare of children.Vivian C. Fox, \\"Poor Children's Rights in Early Modern England,\\" Journal of Psychohistory, Jan 1996, Vol. 23 Issue 3, pp 286‚Äì306 The Age of Innocence c. 1785/8. Reynolds emphasized the natural grace of children in his paintings The modern notion of childhood with its own autonomy and goals began to emerge during the 18th century Enlightenment and the Romantic period that followed it. Jean Jacques Rousseau formulated the romantic attitude towards children in his famous 1762 novel Emile: or, On Education. Building on the ideas of John Locke and other 17th-century thinkers, Jean-Jaques Rousseau described childhood as a brief period of sanctuary before people encounter the perils and hardships of adulthood.David Cohen, The development of play (2006) p 20 Sir Joshua Reynolds' extensive children portraiture demonstrated the new enlightened attitudes toward young children. His 1788 painting The Age of Innocence, emphasizes the innocence and natural grace of the posing child and soon became a public favourite. The idea of childhood as a locus of divinity and innocence is further expounded upon in William Wordsworth's \\"Ode: Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood\\", the imagery of which he \\"fashioned from a complex mix of pastoral aesthetics, pantheistic views of divinity, and an idea of spiritual purity based on an Edenic notion of pastoral innocence infused with Neoplatonic notions of reincarnation\\". This Romantic conception of childhood, historian Margaret Reeves suggests, has a longer history than generally recognized, with its roots traceable to similarly imaginative constructions of childhood circulating, for example, in the neo-platonic poetry of seventeenth-century metaphysical poet Henry Vaughan (e.g., \\"The Retreate\\", 1650; \\"Childe-hood\\", 1655). Such views contrasted with the stridently didactic, Calvinist views of infant depravity. Armenian scouts in 1918 With the onset of industrialisation in England in 1760, the divergence between high-minded romantic ideals of childhood and the reality of the growing magnitude of child exploitation in the workplace, became increasingly apparent. By the late 18th century, British children were specially employed in factories and mines and as chimney sweeps,Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England often working long hours in dangerous jobs for low pay.Barbara Daniels, Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era hiddenlives.org As the century wore on, the contradiction between the conditions on the ground for children of the poor and the middle-class notion of childhood as a time of innocence led to the first campaigns for the imposition of legal protection for children. British reformers attacked child labor from the 1830s onward, bolstered by the horrific descriptions of London street life by Charles Dickens.Amberyl Malkovich, Charles Dickens and the Victorian Child: Romanticizing and Socializing the Imperfect Child (2011) The campaign eventually led to the Factory Acts, which mitigated the exploitation of children at the workplace.\\"The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England\\". Laura Del Col, West Virginia University. = Modern concepts of childhood = Children play in the fountain in a summer evening, Davis, California. Nepalese children playing with cats. Harari girls in Ethiopia. The modern attitude to children emerged by the late 19th century; the Victorian middle and upper classes emphasized the role of the family and the sanctity of the child, ‚Äì an attitude that has remained dominant in Western societies ever since.Thomas E. Jordan, Victorian Child Savers and Their Culture: A Thematic Evaluation (1998) The genre of children's literature took off, with a proliferation of humorous, child-oriented books attuned to the child's imagination. Lewis Carroll's fantasy Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, published in 1865 in England, was a landmark in the genre; regarded as the first \\"English masterpiece written for children\\", its publication opened the \\"First Golden Age\\" of children's literature. The latter half of the 19th century saw the introduction of compulsory state schooling of children across Europe, which decisively removed children from the workplace into schools. The market economy of the 19th century enabled the concept of childhood as a time of fun of happiness. Factory-made dolls and doll houses delighted the girls and organized sports and activities were played by the boys.Howard Chudacoff, Children at Play: An American History (2008) The Boy Scouts was founded by Sir Robert Baden-Powell in 1908, which provided young boys with outdoor activities aiming at developing character, citizenship, and personal fitness qualities. In the 20th century, Philippe Ari√®s, a French historian specializing in medieval history, suggested that childhood was not a natural phenomenon, but a creation of society in his 1960 book Centuries of Childhood. In 1961 he published a study of paintings, gravestones, furniture, and school records, finding that before the 17th-century, children were represented as mini-adults. In 1966, the American philosopher George Boas published the book The Cult of Childhood. Since then, historians have increasingly researched childhood in past times. In 2006 Hugh Cunningham, published the book Invention of Childhood looking at British childhood from the year 1000, the Middle Ages to what he refers to as the Post War Period of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The concept of childhood appears to evolve and change shape as lifestyles change and adult expectations alter. Some believe that children should not have any worries and should not have to work; life should be happy and trouble-free. Childhood is usually a mixture of happiness, wonder, angst and resilience. It is generally a time of playing, learning, socializing, exploring, and worrying in a world without much adult interference, aside from parents. It is a time of learning about responsibilities without having to deal with adult responsibilities. A \\"loss of innocence\\" is a common concept, and is often seen as an integral part of coming of age. It is usually thought of as an experience or period in a child's life that widens their awareness of evil, pain or the world around them. This theme is demonstrated in the novels To Kill a Mockingbird and Lord of the Flies. The fictional character Peter Pan was the embodiment of a childhood that never ends.  Geographies of childhood  The geographies of childhood involves how (adult) society perceives the idea of childhood, the many ways adult attitudes and behaviors affect children's lives, including the environment which surrounds children and its implications. The geographies of childhood is similar in some respects to children's geographies which examines the places and spaces in which children live. = Nature deficit disorder = Nature Deficit Disorder, a term coined by Richard Louv in his 2005 book Last Child in the Woods, refers to the trend in the United States and Canada towards less time for outdoor play,For more children, less time for outdoor play: Busy schedules, less open space, more safety fears, and lure of the Web keep kids inside by Marilyn Gardner, The Christian Science Monitor, June 29, 2006U.S. children and teens spend more time on academics by Diane Swanbrow, The University Record Online, The University of Michigan. resulting in a wide range of behavioral problems.Are your kids really spending enough time outdoors? Getting up close with nature opens a child's eyes to the wonders of the world, with a bounty of health benefits. by Tammie Burak, Canadian Living. With increasing use of cellphones, computers, video games and television, children have more reasons to stay inside rather than outdoors exploring. ‚ÄúThe average American child spends 44 hours a week with electronic media‚Äù.Outside Agitators by Bill O'Driscoll, Pittsburgh City Paper Research in 2007 has drawn a correlation between the declining number of National Park visits in the U.S. and increasing consumption of electronic media by children. The media has accelerated the trend for children's nature disconnection by deemphasizing views of nature, as in Disney films.  Healthy childhoods = Role of parents  Children's health = Children's health includes the physical, mental and social well-being of children. Maintaining children's health implies offering them healthy foods, insuring they get enough sleep and exercise, and protecting their safety. Children in certain parts of the world often suffer from malnutrition, which is often associated with other conditions, such diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria. = Child protection = Child protection, according to UNICEF, refers to \\"preventing and responding to violence, exploitation and abuse against children ‚Äì including commercial sexual exploitation, trafficking, child labour and harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting and child marriage\\".http://www.unicef.org/chinese/protection/files/What_is_Child_Protection.pdf The Convention on the Rights of the Child protects the fundamental rights of children. = Play = Dancing at Mother of Peace AIDs orphanage, right Play is essential to the cognitive, physical, social, and emotional well-being of children. It offers children opportunities for physical (running, jumping, climbing, etc.), intellectual (social skills, community norms, ethics and general knowledge) and emotional development (empathy, compassion, and friendships). Unstructured play encourages creativity and imagination. Playing and interacting with other children, as well as some adults, provides opportunities for friendships, social interactions, conflicts and resolutions. However, adults tend to (often mistakenly) assume that virtually all children's social activities can be understood as \\"play\\" and, furthermore, that children's play activities do not involve much skill or effort. It is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles, sometimes in conjunction with other children or adult caregivers. Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, to resolve conflicts, and to learn self-advocacy skills. However, when play is controlled by adults, children acquiesce to adult rules and concerns and lose some of the benefits play offers them. This is especially true in developing creativity, leadership, and group skills. Ralph Hedley, The Tournament, 1898 Play is considered to be so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as a right of every child. Children who are being raised in a hurried and pressured style may limit the protective benefits they would gain from child-driven play. The initiation of play in a classroom setting allows teachers and students to interact through playfulness associated with a learning experience. Therefore, playfulness aids the interactions between adults and children in a learning environment. ‚ÄúPlayful Structure‚Äù means to combine informal learning with formal learning to produce an effective learning experience for children at a young age. Even though play is considered to be the most important to optimal child development, the environment affects their play and therefore their development. Poor children confront widespread environmental inequities as they experience less social support, and their parents are less responsive and more authoritarian. Children from low income families are less likely to have access to books and computers which would enhance their development.American Psychologist (March 2004), 59 (2), pg. 77‚Äì92 = Street culture = Children in front of a movie theatre, Toronto, 1920s. Children's street culture refers to the cumulative culture created by young children and is sometimes referred to as their secret world. It is most common in children between the ages of seven and twelve. It is strongest in urban working class industrial districts where children are traditionally free to play out in the streets for long periods without supervision. It is invented and largely sustained by children themselves with little adult interference. Young children's street culture usually takes place on quiet backstreets and pavements, and along routes that venture out into local parks, playgrounds, scrub and wasteland, and to local shops. It often imposes imaginative status on certain sections of the urban realm (local buildings, kerbs, street objects, etc.). Children designate specific areas that serve as informal meeting and relaxation places (see: Sobel, 2001). An urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep 'spirit of place' meanings in to children. Since the advent of indoor distractions such as video games, and television, concerns have been expressed about the vitality ‚Äì or even the survival ‚Äì of children's street culture.  Children's rights  Children's rights are the human rights of children, with particular attention to the rights of special protection and care afforded to minors, and provision of basic necessities. Children's rights are not respected in all countries. Globally, millions of children are subjected to exploitation, including deprivation of education, child labour, forced military service, or imprisonment in institutions or detention centers where they endure poor conditions and violence.  Research in social sciences  In recent years there has been a rapid growth of interest in the sociological study of adulthood. Reaching on a large body of contemporary sociological and anthropological research, people have developed key links between the study of childhood and multiple disciplines including social theory, exploring its historical, political, and cultural dimensions internationally.

In human context, the term adult additionally has meanings associated with social and legal concepts. In contrast to a \\"minor\\", a legal adult is a person who has attained the age of majority and is therefore regarded as independent, self-sufficient, and responsible. The typical age of attaining legal adulthood is 18, although definition may vary by legal rights and country. Human adulthood encompasses psychological adult development. Definitions of adulthood are often inconsistent and contradictory; a person may be biologically an adult, and have adult behavior but still be treated as a child if they are under the legal age of majority. Conversely, one may legally be an adult but possess none of the maturity and responsibility that may define an adult character. In different cultures there are events that relate passing from being a child to becoming an adult or coming of age. This often encompasses the passing a series of tests to demonstrate that a person is prepared for adulthood, or reaching a specified age, sometimes in conjunction with demonstrating preparation. Most modern societies determine legal adulthood based on reaching a legally specified age without requiring a demonstration of physical maturity or preparation for adulthood. Biological adulthood A group of adult people Historically and cross-culturally, adulthood has been determined primarily by the start of puberty (the appearance of secondary sex characteristics such as menstruation in women, ejaculation in men, and pubic hair in both sexes). In the past, a person usually moved from the status of child directly to the status of adult, often with this shift being marked by some type of coming-of-age test or ceremony. After the social construct of adolescence was created, adulthood split into two forms: biological adulthood and social adulthood. Thus, there are now two primary forms of adults: biological adults (people who have attained reproductive ability, are fertile, or who evidence secondary sex characteristics) and social adults (people who are recognized by their culture or law as being adults). Depending on the context, adult can indicate either definition. Although few or no established dictionaries provide a definition for the two word term biological adult, the first definition of adult in multiple dictionaries includes \\"the stage of the life cycle of an animal after reproductive capacity has been attained\\".International Dictionary of Medicine and Biology (1986)Churchill's Medical Dictionary (1989) Thus, the base definition of the word adult is the period beginning at physical sexual maturity, which occurs sometime after the onset of puberty. Although this is the primary definition of the base word \\"adult\\", the term is also frequently used to refer to social adults. The two-word term biological adult stresses or clarifies that the original definition, based on physical maturity, is being used. The time of puberty varies, but usually begins around 10 or 11 years old. Girls typically begin the process of puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12. Girls generally complete puberty by 15‚Äì17, and boys by age 16 or 17. Nutrition, genetics and environment also usually play a part in the onset of puberty. Legal adulthood Legally, adulthood typically means that one has reached the age of majority ‚Äì when parents lose parenting rights and responsibilities regarding the person concerned. Depending on one's jurisdiction, the age of majority may or may not be set independently of and should not be confused with the minimum ages applicable to other activities, such as engaging in a contract, marriage, voting, having a job, serving in the military, buying/possessing firearms, driving, traveling abroad, involvement with alcoholic beverages, smoking, sexual activity, gambling, being a model or actor in pornography, running for President, etc. Admission of a young person to a place may be restricted because of danger for that person, concern that the place may lead the person to immoral behavior or because of the risk that the young person causes damage (for example, at an exhibition of fragile items). One can distinguish the legality of acts of a young person, or of enabling a young person to carry out that act, by selling, renting out, showing, permitting entrance, allowing participation, etc. There may be distinction between commercially and socially enabling. Sometimes there is the requirement of supervision by a legal guardian, or just by an adult. Sometimes there is no requirement, but rather a recommendation. Using the example of pornography, one can distinguish between: * being allowed inside an adult establishment * being allowed to purchase pornography * being allowed to possess pornography * another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person pornography, see disseminating pornography to a minor * being a pornographic actor: rules for the young person, and for other people, regarding production, possession, etc. (see child pornography) With regard to films with violence, etc.: * another person being allowed to sell, rent out, or show the young person a film; a cinema being allowed to let a young person enter The age of majority ranges internationally from ages 15 to 21, with 18 being the most common age. Nigeria, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon define adulthood at age 15, but marriage of girls at an earlier age is common. In most of the world, including most of the United States, India and China, the legal adult age is 18 (historically 21) for most purposes, with some notable exceptions: # British Columbia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Nunavut, Yukon Territory in Canada (though there are some exceptions in which Canadians may be considered legal adults in certain situations like sexual consent); Nebraska and Alabama in The United States, and South Korea (19) # Indonesia (20) # Mississippi and Puerto Rico in the U.S. (21) Social construction of adulthood In contrast to biological perspectives of aging and adulthood, social scientists conceptualize adulthood as socially constructed.Elder, Glen H. Jr. 1985. ‚ÄúPerspectives on the life course.‚Äù op. 23-49 in Life Course Dynamics: Trajectories and Transitions, 1968‚Äì1980, ed. Glen H. Elder Jr. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.Settersten, Richard A. 1999. Lives in Time and Place: The Problems and Promises of Developmental Science. Amityville, NY: Baywood Publishing Company. While aging is an established biological process, the attainment of adulthood is social in its criteria. In contrast to other perspectives that conceptualize aging and the attainment of adulthood as a largely universal development, regardless of context, nation, generation, gender, race, or social class. Social scientists regard these aspects as paramount in cultural definitions of adulthood.Ryff, Carol D. 1985. ‚ÄúThe Subjective Experience of Life-Span Transitions.‚Äù In Gender and the life course, by Alice S. Rossi, 97‚Äì113. New York: Adine. Further evidence of adulthood as a social construction is illustrated by the changing criteria of adulthood over time. Historically, adulthood in the U.S. has rested on completing one's education, moving away from the family of origin, and beginning one's career.Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 1998. ‚ÄúLearning to Stand Alone: The Contemporary American Transition to Adulthood in Cultural and Historical Context.‚Äù Human Development 41:295‚Äì315.Levinson, Daniel J. 1978.

Other key historical criteria include entering a marriage and becoming a parent. These criteria are social and subjective; they are organized by gender, race, ethnicity, social class, among other key identity markers. As a result, particular populations feel adult earlier in the life course than do others.Arnett, Jeffrey Jensen. 2001. ‚ÄúConceptions of the Transition to Adulthood among Emerging Adults in American Ethnic Groups.‚Äù Journal of Adult Development, 8:133‚Äì143.Aronson, Pamela. 2008. ‚ÄúThe Markers and Meanings of Growing Up: Contemporary Young Women‚Äôs Transition from Adolescence to Adulthood.‚Äù Gender & Society 22:56‚Äì82.Barrett, Anne. 2003. ‚ÄúSocioeconomic Status and Age Identity: The Role of Dimensions of Health in the Subjective Construction of Age Identity.‚Äù Journal of Gerontology 58: 101‚Äì110.Barrett, Anne. 2005. ‚ÄúGendered Experiences in Midlife: Implications for Age Identity.‚Äù Journal of Aging Studies 19:163‚Äì183. Contemporary experiences of and research on young adults today substitute more seemingly subjective criteria for adulthood which resonate more soundly with young adults' experiences of aging.Furstenberg, Frank F.

Religion According to Jewish tradition, adulthood is reached at age 13 (the minimum age of the Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah) for Jewish boys and girls; they are expected to demonstrate preparation for adulthood by learning the Torah and other Jewish practices. The Christian Bible and Jewish scripture contain no age requirement for adulthood or marrying, which includes engaging in sexual activity The 1983 Code of Canon Law states, \\"A man before he has completed his sixteenth year of age, and likewise a woman before she has completed her fourteenth year of age, cannot enter a valid marriage\\".canon 1083, ¬ß1 According to The Disappearance of Childhood by Neil Postman, the Christian Church of the Middle Ages considered the age of accountability, when a person could be tried and even executed as an adult, to be age 7.

The marriage was opposed by the governments of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Religious, legal, political, and moral objections were raised. As the British monarch, Edward was the nominal head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry in church if their ex-spouses were still alive. For this reason, it was widely believed that Edward could not marry Simpson and remain on the throne. Simpson was perceived to be politically and socially unsuitable as a prospective queen consort because of her two failed marriages. It was widely assumed by the Establishment that she was driven by love of money or position rather than love for the King. Despite the opposition, Edward declared that he loved Simpson and intended to marry her as soon as her second divorce was finalised. The widespread unwillingness to accept Simpson as the King's consort and Edward's refusal to give her up led to his abdication in December 1936. He was succeeded by his brother Albert, who became George VI. Edward was given the title of Duke of Windsor, and styled Royal Highness, following his abdication, and he married Simpson the following year. They remained married until his death 35 years later. Prelude Edward in 1932 Edward had been introduced to Wallis Simpson, an American citizen and wife of British shipping executive Ernest Aldrich Simpson, by Lady Furness on 10 January 1931. Ernest Simpson was Wallis's second husband; her first marriage, to U.S. Navy pilot Win Spencer, had ended in divorce in 1927. It is generally accepted that Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales became lovers in 1934, while Lady Furness (who was also in a relationship with the prince) was visiting relatives in the United States. However, Edward adamantly insisted to his father that he was not physically intimate with Simpson and that it was inappropriate to describe her as his mistress.Ziegler, p. 233 Edward's relationship with Simpson further weakened his poor relationship with his parents. Although King George V and Queen Mary met Simpson at Buckingham Palace in 1935,Windsor, p. 255 they later refused to receive her.Bradford, p. 142 Edward and Simpson were secretly followed by members of the Metropolitan Police Special Branch, who produced reports on the nature of their relationship and their investigations into Wallis Simpson's private life that included the \\"pursuit of vicious gossip\\" and the identification of a \\"secret lover\\". The prospect of having an American divorcee with a questionable past having such sway over the heir apparent led to anxiety among government and establishment figures.Ziegler, pp. 231‚Äì234 Edward VIII succeeded his father on 20 January 1936, after which Simpson attended more official functions as the King's guest. Despite her name appearing regularly in the Court Circular, the name of her husband was conspicuously absent.Broad, p. 37. In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by the British press, which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who had access to the foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.Broad, p. 47. Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson in the Mediterranean, 1936 By October, it was rumoured in high society and abroad that Edward intended to marry Simpson as soon as she was free to do so.Beaverbrook, pp. 28‚Äì33; Windsor, p. 314; Ziegler, pp. 292‚Äì295. At the end of that month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent.Broad, p. 56; Williams, p. 85. The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: \\"The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson is not going to be maintained ... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous.\\"Broad, p. 71. Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter.Williams, pp. 93‚Äì94. The King invited Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to Buckingham Palace the following Monday (16 November) and informed him that he intended to marry Simpson. Baldwin replied that such a marriage would not be acceptable to the people, stating: \\"... the Queen becomes the Queen of the country. Therefore in the choice of a Queen the voice of the people must be heard\\".Broad, p. 75. Baldwin's view was shared by the Australian High Commissioner in London, Stanley Bruce, who was also a former Prime Minister of Australia. On the same day that Hardinge wrote to the King, Bruce met Hardinge and then wrote to Baldwin, expressing horror at the idea of a marriage between the King and Simpson.Williams, p. 101. Nevertheless, the British press remained quiet on the subject until Alfred Blunt, Bishop of Bradford, gave a speech to his diocesan conference on 1 December, which alluded to the King's need of divine grace: \\"We hope that he is aware of his need. Some of us wish that he gave more positive signs of his awareness.\\"Williams, p. 134. The press took this for the first public comment by a notable person on the crisis and it became front-page news the following day. When asked about it later, however, the bishop claimed he had not heard of Simpson at the time he wrote the speech.Williams, p. 146. Acting on the advice of Edward's staff, Simpson left Britain for the south of France two days later in an attempt to escape intense press attention. Both she and the King were devastated by the separation. At a tearful departure, the King told her, \\"I shall never give you up.\\"Williams, pp. 149‚Äì151. Opposition Opposition to the King and his marriage came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy and make it more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public,Williams, pp. 8‚Äì11. was distrusted by the British Establishment.The Duke of Windsor, p. 136. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies with disdain, and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.The Duke of Windsor, p. 301; Beaverbrook, p. 14; Williams, pp. 70‚Äì71. =Social and moral= Wallis Simpson, 1936 Government ministers and the royal family found Wallis Simpson's background and behaviour unacceptable for a potential queen. Rumours and innuendo about her circulated in society.See, for example, Virginia Woolf's diary quoted in Williams, p. 40. The King's mother, Queen Mary, was even told that Simpson might have held some sort of sexual control over Edward, as she had released him from an undefined sexual dysfunction through practices learnt in a Chinese brothel.Ziegler, p. 236. This view was partially shared by Alan Don, Chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who wrote that he suspected the King \\"is sexually abnormal which may account for the hold Mrs S. has over him\\".Howarth, p. 61. Even Edward VIII's official biographer, Philip Ziegler, noted that: \\"There must have been some sort of sadomasochistic relationship ... [Edward] relished the contempt and bullying she bestowed on him.\\"Quoted in Police detectives following Simpson reported back that, while involved with Edward, she was also involved with a married car mechanic and salesman named Guy Trundle.Williams, pp. 96‚Äì97. This may well have been passed on to senior figures in the establishment, including members of the royal family.Vickers, p. 163. Joseph Kennedy, the American ambassador, described her as a \\"tart\\", and his wife, Rose, refused to dine with her.Vickers, p. 185. Wallis was perceived to be pursuing Edward for his money; his equerry wrote that she would eventually leave him, \\"having secured the cash\\".John Aird's diary, quoted in Ziegler, p. 234. The future prime minister Neville Chamberlain (then Chancellor of the Exchequer) wrote in his diary that she was \\"an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes. She has already ruined him in money and jewels ...\\"Ziegler, p. 312. Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were strained during the inter-war years and the majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans with disdain and considered them socially inferior.Williams, pp. 40‚Äì41. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage,Williams, p. 266. as was most of the American press.Williams, p. 90; Ziegler, p. 296. =Religious and legal= In Edward's lifetime, the Church of England disapproved of divorced people remarrying in church while a former spouse was still living. The monarch was required to be in communion with the Church of England, and was its nominal head or Supreme Governor. In 1935 the Church of England reaffirmed that, \\"in no circumstances can Christian men or women re-marry during the lifetime of a wife or a husband\\". The Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang, held that the King, as the head of the Church of England, could not marry a divorc√©e.G. I. T. Machin, \\"Marriage and the Churches in the 1930s: Royal abdication and divorce reform, 1936‚Äì7.\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 42.1 (1991): 68‚Äì81. If Edward married Wallis Simpson, a divorcee who would soon have two living ex-husbands, in a civil ceremony, it would directly conflict with Church teaching and his role as the Church's ex officio head. Wallis's first divorce (in the United States on the grounds of \\"emotional incompatibility\\") was not recognised by the Church of England and, if challenged in the English courts, might not have been recognised under English law. At that time, the Church and English law considered adultery to be the only grounds for divorce. Consequently, under this argument, her second marriage, as well as her marriage to Edward, would be considered bigamous and invalid.Bradford, p. 241. =Political= Fort Belvedere, Surrey, Edward's residence in Windsor Great Park When Edward visited depressed mining villages in Wales, his comment that \\"something must be done\\"The Duke of Windsor, p. 338. led to concerns among elected politicians that he would interfere in political matters, traditionally avoided by constitutional monarchs. Ramsay MacDonald, Lord President of the Council, wrote of the King's comments: \\"These escapades should be limited. They are an invasion into the field of politics and should be watched constitutionally.\\"Ramsay MacDonald's diary, quoted in Williams, p. 60. Although Edward's comments had made him popular in Wales,See, for example, Williams, p. 59. he became extremely unpopular with the public in Scotland following his refusal to open a new wing of Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, saying he could not do so because he was in mourning for his father. The day after the opening, he was pictured in newspapers on holiday: he had turned down the public event in favour of meeting Simpson.Vickers, p. 140; Ziegler, p. 288. As Prince of Wales, Edward had publicly referred to Labour county councillors as \\"cranks\\"The Duke of Windsor, p. 253. and made speeches counter to government policy.Beaverbrook, p. 20. During his reign as king, his refusal to accept the advice of ministers continued: he opposed the imposition of sanctions on Italy after its invasion of Ethiopia, refused to receive the deposed Emperor of Ethiopia, and would not support a strengthening of the League of Nations.Ziegler, pp. 271‚Äì272. Members of the British government became further dismayed by the proposed marriage after being told that Wallis Simpson was an agent of Nazi Germany. The Foreign Office obtained leaked dispatches from the German Reich's Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Joachim von Ribbentrop, which revealed his strong view that opposition to the marriage was motivated by the wish \\"to defeat those Germanophile forces which had been working through Mrs Simpson\\".Howarth, p. 62. It was rumoured that Simpson had access to confidential government papers sent to Edward, which he left unguarded at his Fort Belvedere residence.Williams, pp. 196‚Äì197; Ziegler, pp. 273‚Äì274. While Edward was abdicating, the personal protection officers guarding Simpson in exile in France sent reports to Downing Street suggesting that she might \\"flit to Germany\\". Options considered As a result of these rumours and arguments, the belief strengthened among the British establishment that Simpson could not become a royal consort. British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin explicitly advised Edward that the majority of people would be opposed to his marrying Simpson, indicating that if he did, in direct contravention of his ministers' advice, the government would resign en masse. The King responded, according to his own account later: \\"I intend to marry Mrs Simpson as soon as she is free to marry ... if the Government opposed the marriage, as the Prime Minister had given me reason to believe it would, then I was prepared to go.\\"The Duke of Windsor, p. 332. Under pressure from the King, and \\"startled\\" at the suggested abdication, Baldwin agreed to take further soundings on three options: # Edward and Simpson marry and she become queen (a royal marriage); # Edward and Simpson marry, but she not become queen, instead receiving some courtesy title (a morganatic marriage); or # Abdication for Edward and any potential heirs he might father, allowing him to make any marital decisions without further constitutional implications. Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King (left) and his British counterpart Stanley Baldwin (right), 1926 The second option had European precedents, including Edward's own great-grandfather, Duke Alexander of W√ºrttemberg, but it had no parallel in British constitutional history. The prime ministers of the five Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the Irish Free State) were consulted, and the majority agreed that there was \\"no alternative to course (3)\\".√âamon de Valera quoted in Bradford, p. 188. William Lyon Mackenzie King (Prime Minister of Canada), Joseph Lyons (Prime Minister of Australia), and J. B. M. Hertzog (Prime Minister of South Africa) opposed options 1 and 2. Mackenzie King told Edward to do \\"what he believed in his own heart was right\\" and the Canadian government appealed to the King to put his duty before his feelings for Simpson. Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir told Buckingham Palace and Baldwin that Canadians held deep affection for the King, but also that Canadian public opinion would be outraged if Edward married a divorcee. Michael Joseph Savage (Prime Minister of New Zealand) rejected option 1 and thought that option 2 \\"might be possible ... if some solution along these lines were found to be practicable\\", but \\"would be guided by the decision of the Home government\\".Williams, p. 130. In communications with the British government, √âamon de Valera (President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State) remarked that as a Roman Catholic country, the Irish Free State did not recognise divorce. He supposed that if the British people would not accept Wallis Simpson then abdication was the only possible solution.Williams, pp. 130‚Äì131. On 24 November, Baldwin consulted the three leading opposition politicians in Britain: Leader of the Opposition Clement Attlee, Liberal leader Sir Archibald Sinclair, and Winston Churchill. Sinclair and Attlee agreed that options 1 and 2 were unacceptable, and Churchill pledged to support the government.Williams, p. 113. Churchill did not support the government, however. In July, he had advised the King's legal counsel, Walter Monckton, against the divorce, but his advice was ignored.Williams, p. 173; Ziegler, p. 291. As soon as the affair became public knowledge, Churchill started to pressure Baldwin and the King to delay any decisions until parliament and the people had been consulted.Williams, pp. 173‚Äì176. In a private letter to Geoffrey Dawson, the editor of The Times newspaper, Churchill suggested that a delay would be beneficial because, given time, the King might fall out of love with Simpson.Williams, p. 177. Baldwin rejected the request for delay, presumably because he preferred to resolve the crisis quickly. Supporters of the King alleged a conspiracy between Baldwin, Geoffrey Dawson, and Cosmo Gordon Lang, the Archbishop of Canterbury.Evans, W. (1968), Journey to Harley Street, London: David Rendel, p. 219. The royal physician Bertrand Dawson was possibly involved in a plan to force the prime minister to retire on the grounds of heart disease, but he eventually accepted, on the evidence of an early electrocardiograph, that Baldwin's heart was sound.Evans, p. 221. Political support for the King was scattered and comprised politicians alienated from the mainstream parties such as Churchill, Oswald Mosley, and the Communists.Williams, pp. 179‚Äì181. David Lloyd George also supported the King despite disliking Simpson. He was, however, unable to take any active role in the crisis because he was on holiday in Jamaica with his mistress Frances Stevenson.Williams, pp. 198‚Äì199. In early December, rumours circulated that the King's supporters would join together in a \\"King's Party\\", led by Churchill. However, there was no concerted effort to form an organised movement and Churchill had no intention of leading one.Williams, pp. 181‚Äì182. Nevertheless, the rumours damaged the King and Churchill severely, as members of parliament were horrified at the idea of the King interfering in politics.Williams, pp. 199‚Äì200. The letters and diaries of working-class people and ex-servicemen generally demonstrate support for the King, while those from the middle and upper classes tend to express indignation and distaste.See, for example, Williams, pp. 138‚Äì144. The Times, The Morning Post, Daily Herald, and newspapers owned by Lord Kemsley, such as The Daily Telegraph, opposed the marriage. On the other hand, the Express and Mail, owned by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere, respectively, appeared to support a morganatic marriage.Beaverbrook, p. 68; Broad, p. 188; Ziegler, p. 308. The King estimated that the newspapers in favour had a circulation of 12.5 million, and those against had 8.5 million.Ziegler, p. 308; The Duke of Windsor, p. 373. On 3 December, Edward had a \\"tense\\" meeting with Baldwin. Backed by Churchill and Beaverbrook, Edward proposed to broadcast a speech via the BBC. The proposed text invoked the \\"ancient custom\\" for a King to \\"address his public utterances to his people\\". Edward proposed to remind his listeners: \\"I am still the same man whose motto was 'Ich Dien', I serve.\\" In the proposed speech, Edward indicated his desire to remain on the throne or to be recalled to it if forced to abdicate, while marrying Simpson morganatically. In one section, Edward proposed to say: Baldwin blocked the speech, saying that it would shock many people and would be a grave breach of constitutional principles. By modern convention, the sovereign could only act with the advice and counsel of ministers. In seeking the people's support against the government, Edward was opting to oppose binding ministerial advice and instead act as a private individual. Edward's British ministers felt that, in proposing the speech, Edward had revealed his disdainful attitude towards constitutional conventions and threatened the political neutrality of the Crown.Beaverbrook, p. 71; Williams, p. 156. Cabinet Office files released in 2013 show that on or before 5 December 1936, the Home Secretary, Sir John Simon, had ordered the General Post Office (which controlled British telephone services) to intercept \\"telephone communications between Fort Belvedere and Buckingham Palace on the one hand and the continent of Europe on the other\\". On 5 December, having in effect been told that he could not keep the throne and marry Simpson, and having had his request to broadcast to the Empire to explain \\"his side of the story\\" blocked on constitutional grounds,The Duke of Windsor, pp. 378‚Äì379. Edward chose the third option.The Duke of Windsor, pp. 386‚Äì387. Legal manoeuvres Following Simpson's divorce hearing on 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became concerned that there would be a \\"patriotic\\" citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. (subscription required). The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as if it were an undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes. Upon his arrival, Goddard warned his client that a citizen's intervention, should it arise, was likely to succeed. It was, according to Goddard, his duty to advise her to withdraw her divorce petition. Simpson refused, but they both telephoned the King to inform him that she was willing to give him up so that he could remain king. It was, however, too late; the King had already made up his mind to go, even if he could not marry Simpson. Indeed, as the belief that the abdication was inevitable gathered strength, Goddard stated that: \\"[his] client was ready to do anything to ease the situation but the other end of the wicket [Edward VIII] was determined\\". Goddard had a weak heart and had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to accompany him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even that she was having an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).Beaverbrook, p. 81; Williams, p. 217. Abdication \\"The Year of the Three Kings\\", postcard 1936 Abdication statement of Edward VIII At Fort Belvedere, on 10 December, Edward signed his written abdication notices, witnessed by his three younger brothers: Prince Albert, Duke of York (who succeeded Edward as George VI); Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester; and Prince George, Duke of Kent. The following day, it was given effect by Act of Parliament: His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936. Under changes introduced in 1931 by the Statute of Westminster, a single Crown for the entire empire had been replaced by multiple crowns, one for each Dominion, worn by a single monarch in an organisation then known as the British Commonwealth. Though the British government, hoping for expediency and to avoid embarrassment, wished the Dominions to accept the actions of the \\"home\\" government, the Dominions held that Edward's abdication required the consent of each Commonwealth state. Under the Statute of Westminster, the act passed by the UK parliament could become law in other Dominions at their request. This was duly given by the Parliament of Australia, which was at the time in session, and by the governments of Canada, South Africa, and New Zealand, whose parliaments were in recess. The government of the Irish Free State, taking the opportunity presented by the crisis and in a major step towards its eventual transition to a republic, passed an amendment to its constitution on 11 December to remove references to the Crown and abolish the office of Governor-General of the Irish Free State; the King's abdication was recognised a day later in the External Relations Act. In South Africa, His Majesty King Edward the Eighth's Abdication Act 1937 declared that the abdication took effect there on 10 December. Canada passed the Succession to the Throne Act 1937 to symbolically confirm the abdication. Edward's supporters felt that he had \\"been hounded from the throne by that arch humbug Baldwin\\",David Lloyd George quoted in Williams, p. 241. but many members of the establishment were relieved by Edward's departure. Mackenzie King wrote in his diary on 8 December 1936 that Edward's \\"sense of right or wrong has been largely obliterated by the jazz of life he has led for years\\" and, upon receiving news of Edward's final decision to abdicate, \\"if that is the kind of man he is it is better he should not be longer on the Throne.\\" Edward's own Assistant Private Secretary, Alan Lascelles, had told Baldwin as early as 1927: \\"I can't help thinking that the best thing that could happen to him, and to the country, would be for him to break his neck.\\"Hart-Davis, Duff, ed. (1989) In Royal Service: Letters & Journals of Sir Alan Lascelles from 1920 to 1936, quoted in Vickers, Hugo. \\"The courtier's spiky tongue\\". The Times, Thursday, 26 January 1989. On 11 December 1936, Edward made a BBC radio broadcast from Windsor Castle; having abdicated, he was introduced by Sir John Reith as \\"His Royal Highness Prince Edward\\".The Duke of Windsor, p. 413; Ziegler, p. 331. The official address had been polished by Churchill and was moderate in tone, speaking about Edward's inability to do his job \\"as I would have wished\\" without the support of \\"the woman I love\\".The Duke of Windsor, pp. 409‚Äì413. Edward's reign had lasted 327 days, the shortest of any British monarch since the disputed reign of Lady Jane Grey over 380 years earlier. The day following the broadcast he left Britain for Austria.Ziegler, p. 336. Post-abdication The Duke of Windsor, formerly Edward VIII, 1945 George VI granted his elder brother the title of Duke of Windsor with the style His Royal Highness on 12 December 1936. On 3 May the following year, the Simpsons' divorce was made final. The case was handled quietly and it barely featured in some newspapers. The Times printed a single sentence below a separate, and seemingly unconnected, report announcing the Duke's departure from Austria.\\"Mrs Ernest Simpson's Divorce\\". The Times, Tuesday, 4 May 1937, p. 5, col. C; \\"The Duke of Windsor: Departure from Austria\\", The Times, Tuesday, 4 May 1937, p. 5, col. C. Edward married Wallis in France on 3 June 1937. She became the Duchess of Windsor, but, much to Edward's disgust, George VI issued letters patent that denied her the style of Her Royal Highness.Ziegler, p. 529. The couple settled in France, and the Duke received a tax-free allowance from his brother, which Edward supplemented by writing his memoirs and by illegal currency trading. He also profited from the sale of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House to George VI. Both estates are private property and not part of the Royal Estate, and were therefore inherited and owned by Edward, regardless of the abdication.Ziegler, pp. 376‚Äì378. In October 1937, the Duke and Duchess visited Germany, against the advice of the British government, and met Hitler at his Obersalzberg retreat. The visit was much publicised by the German media. During the visit the Duke gave full Nazi salutes. In an article for the New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune of 13 December 1966 the Duke wrote that in 1937 Hitler persuaded him \\"it was in Britain's interest and in Europe's too, that Germany be encouraged to strike east and smash Communism forever ... I thought the rest of us could be fence-sitters while the Nazis and the Reds slogged it out.\\"\\"Windsor Helpless as World Drifts to War\\", Chicago Tribune, 13 December 1966, p. 2 After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Edward was assigned to the British Military Mission in France.Matthew, H.

They [the British] don't want me as their king, but I'll be back as their leader.\\" He was reported as saying that \\"it would be a tragic thing for the world if Hitler was overthrown\\". Comments like these reinforced the belief that the Duke and Duchess held Nazi sympathies and the effect of the abdication crisis of 1936 was to force off the throne a man with extreme political opinions.Ziegler, pp. 434 ff. Claims that Edward would have been a threat or that he was removed by a political conspiracy to dethrone him remain speculative and \\"persist largely because since 1936 the contemporary public considerations have lost most of their force and so seem, wrongly, to provide insufficient explanation for the King's departure\\".

Metropolitan Museum of Art. Demetrius I (Greek: ), also called Dharmamita, was a Greco-Bactrian/Indo-Greek (Yona in Pali language, \\"Yavana\\" in Sanskrit) king (reigned c. 200‚Äì180 BC), who ruled areas from Bactria to ancient northwestern India. He was the son of the Greco-Bactrian ruler Euthydemus I and succeeded him around 200 BC, after which he conquered extensive areas in what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan.Demetrius is said to have founded Taxila (archaeological excavations), and also Sagala in the Punjab, which he seemed to have called Euthydemia, after his father (\\"the city of Sagala, also called Euthydemia\\" (Ptolemy, Geographia, VII 1)) He was never defeated in battle and was posthumously qualified as the Invincible (Aniketos) on the pedigree coins of his successor Agathocles.No undisputed coins of Demetrius I himself use this title, but it is employed on one of the pedigree coins issued by Agathocles, which bear on the reverse the classical profile of Demetrius crowned by the elephant scalp, with the legend DEMETRIOU ANIKETOU, and on the reverse Herakles crowning himself, with the legend \\"Of king Agathocles\\" (Boppearachchi, Pl 8). Coins of the supposed Demetrius III also use the title \\"Invincible\\", and therefore are attributed by some to the same Demetrius (Whitehead and al.) Demetrius I may have been the initiator of the Yavana era, starting in 186‚Äì185 BC, which was used for several centuries thereafter. \\"Demetrius\\" was the name of at least two and probably three Greek kings of Bactria.

Although he commanded 10,000 horsemen, Euthydemus initially lost a battle on the AriusPolybius 10.49, Battle of the Arius and had to retreat. He then successfully resisted a three-year siege in the fortified city of Bactra, before Antiochus finally decided to recognize the new ruler. The final negotiations were made between Antiochus III and Demetrius. Antiochus III was reportedly highly impressed by the demeanour of the young prince, and offered him one of his daughters, Laodice, in marriage, around 206 BC: :\\"And after several journeys of Teleas to and fro between the two, Euthydemus at last sent his son Demetrius to confirm the terms of the treaty. Antiochus received the young prince; and judging from his appearance, conversation, and the dignity of his manners that he was worthy of royal power, he first promised to give him one of his own daughters, and secondly conceded the royal title to his father.\\" Polybius 11.34Polybius 11.34 Siege of Bactra The term used for \\"young prince\\" is neaniskos (ŒΩŒµŒ±ŒΩŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ), suggesting an age around 16, which in turn gives a birth date for Demetrius around 222 BC. =Kuliab inscription= In an inscription found in the Kuliab area of Tadjikistan, in western Greco-Bactria, and dated to 200-195 BC,Shane Wallace Greek Culture in Afghanistan and India: Old Evidence and New Discoveries p.206 a Greek by the name of Heliodotos, dedicating a fire altar to Hestia, mentions Euthydemus as the greatest of all kings, and his son as œÑŒµ œÄŒ±·øñŒ¥Œ± Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒØŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫œÄœÅŒµœÄ·øÜ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒÆœÑœÅŒπŒøŒΩ \\"his son, the glorious, victorious and remarkable Demetrios\\":Osmund Bopearachchi, Some Observations on the Chronology of the Early Kushans, p.48 Invasion of India BAKTRIA, Greco-Baktrian Kingdom.

The Mauryans had diplomatic alliances with the Greeks, and they may have been considered as allies by the Greco-Bactrians. According to Badra, the last Mauryan Emperor, Brihadratha Maurya married a daughter of Demetrius, allegedly named Berenice. * Description of the 302 BC marital alliance in Strabo 15.2.1(9): \\"The Indians occupy [in part] some of the countries situated along the Indus, which formerly belonged to the Persians: Alexander deprived the Ariani of them, and established there settlements of his own. But Seleucus I Nicator gave them to Sandrocottus in consequence of a marriage contract, and received in return five hundred elephants.\\" The ambassador Megasthenes was also sent to the Mauryan court on this occasion. * In the Edicts of Ashoka, king Ashoka claims to have sent Buddhist emissaries to the Hellenistic west around 250 BC. * When Antiochus III the Great, after having made peace with Euthydemus, went to India in 209 BC, he is said to have renewed his friendship with the Indian king there and received presents from him: \\"He crossed the Caucasus (Hindu Kush) and descended into India; renewed his friendship with Sophagasenus the king of the Indians; received more elephants, until he had a hundred and fifty altogether; and having once more provisioned his troops, set out again personally with his army: leaving Androsthenes of Cyzicus the duty of taking home the treasure which this king had agreed to hand over to him.\\"Polybius 11.39 The Greco-Bactrians may also have invaded India in order to protect Greek populations in the subcontinent.\\"Obviously, for the Greeks who survived in India and suffered from the oppression of the Shunga (for whom they were aliens and heretics), Demetrios must have appeared as a saviour\\" Mario Bussagli, p. 101 Demetrius may have first started to recover the province of Arachosia, an area south of the Hindu Kush already inhabited by many Greeks but ruled by the Mauryas since the annexation of the territory by Chandragupta from Seleucus. In his \\"Parthian stations\\", Isidorus of Charax mentions a colony named Demetrias, supposedly founded by Demetrius himself: :\\"Beyond is Arachosia. And the Parthians call this White India; there are the city of Biyt and the city of Pharsana and the city of Chorochoad and the city of Demetrias; then Alexandropolis, the metropolis of Arachosia; it is Greek, and by it flows the river Arachotus. As far as this place the land is under the rule of the Parthians.\\" \\"Parthians stations\\", 1st century BCMentioned in Bopearachchi, \\"Monnaies Greco-Bactriennes et Indo-Grecques\\", p52. Original text in paragraph 19 of Parthian stations A Greek dedication inscribed on stone and discovered in Kuliab, a hundred kilometers northeast of Ai-Khanoum, also mentioned the victories of the prince Demetrius during the reign of his father: :\\"Heliodotos dedicated this fragrant altar (...) so that the greatest of all kings Euthydemus, as well as his son, the glorious, victorious and remarkable Demetrius, be preserved of all pains, with the help of the Fortune with divine thoughts\\"Heliodotos inscription, in \\"Afghanistan, ancien carrefour entre l'Est et Ouest\\", p133. Silver tetradrachm of Demetrius I. British Museum. The Greek campaigns may have gone as far as the capital Pataliputra in eastern India (today Patna): :\\"Those who came after Alexander went to the Ganges and Pataliputra\\" (Strabo, XV.698) :\\"The Greeks who caused Bactria to revolt grew so powerful on account of the fertility of the country that they became masters, not only of Ariana, but also of India, as Apollodorus of Artemita says: and more tribes were subdued by them than by Alexander ‚Äî by Menander in particular (at least if he actually crossed the Hypanis towards the east and advanced as far as the Ima√ºs), for some were subdued by him personally and others by Demetrius, the son of Euthydemus the king of the Bactrians.\\" (Strabo 11.11.1Strabo 11.11.1 full text) It is generally considered that Demetrius ruled in Taxila (where many of his coins were found in the archaeological site of Sirkap). The Indian records also describes Greek attacks on Saketa, Panchala, Mathura and Pataliputra (Gargi-Samhita, Yuga Purana chapter). However, the campaigns to Pataliputra are generally attested to the later king Menander I and Demetrius I probably only invaded areas in Pakistan. Other kings may have expanded the territory as well. By c. 175 BC, the Indo-Greeks ruled parts of northwestern India, while the Shungas remained in the Gangetic, Central, and Eastern India. The Hathigumpha inscription of the Kalinga king Kharavela mentions that fearing him, a Yavana (Greek) king or general retreated to Mathura with his demoralized army. The name of the Yavana king is not clear, but it contains three letters, and the middle letter can be read as ma or mi.Kus√¢na Coins and History, D.K. Printworld, 1994, p.184, note 5; reprint of a 1985 article Some historians, such as R. D. Banerji and K.P. Jayaswal reconstructed the name of the Yavana king as \\"Dimita\\", and identified him with Demetrius. However, several other historians, such as Ramaprasad Chanda, Sailendra Nath Sen and P.L. Gupta disagree with this interpretation. =Indian coinage in Gandhara (after 185 BC)= Taxila single-die coin with Lakshmi and arched-hill symbol (185‚Äì160 BC). The year 185 BC, with the invasion of the Greco-Bactrians into India, marks an evolution in the design of single-die cast coins in the coinage of Gandhara, as deities and realistic animals were introduced. At the same time coinage technology also evolved, as double-die coins (engraved on both sides, obverse and reverse) started to appear. The archaeological excavations of coins have shown that these coins, as well as the new double die coins, were contemporary with those of the Indo- Greeks.Ancient Indian Coinage, Rekha Jain, D.K.Printworld Ltd, p.114 According to Osmund Bopearachchi these coins, and particularly those depicting the goddess Lakshmi, were probably minted by Demetrius I following his invasion of Gandhara.Osmund Bopearachchi, 2016, Emergence of Vi·π£·πáu and ≈öiva Images in India: Numismatic and Sculptural Evidence Aftermath obol of Demetrius. Extremely small (12 millimeters in diameter), but beautifully crafted. Demetrius I died of unknown reasons, and the date 180 BC is merely a suggestion aimed to allow suitable regnal periods for subsequent kings, of which there were several. Even if some of them were co-regents, civil wars and temporary divisions of the empire are most likely. The kings Pantaleon, Antimachus, Agathocles and possibly Euthydemus II ruled after Demetrius I, and theories about their origin include all of them being relatives of Demetrius I, or only Antimachus. Eventually, the kingdom of Bactria fell to the able newcomer Eucratides. Demetrius II was a later king, possibly a son or nephew of his namesake, and he ruled in India only. Justin mentions him being defeated by the Bactrian king Eucratides, an event which took place at the end of the latter's reign, possibly around 150 BC. Demetrius II left behind his generals Apollodotus and Menander, who in turn became kings of India and rulers of the Indo-Greek Kingdom following his death. According to Ptolemy, a Demetriapolis was founded in Arachosia. Demetrius is a legend as well as an enigma. He was mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer (\\"D, lord of Ind\\"). Demetrius and Buddhism Greco-Buddhist representation of Buddha, Gandhara, 1st-2nd century AD. Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested by W. W. Tarn that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the Mauryan empire in reaction to the persecution by the Sungas against Buddhism. However, that persecution in turn is debatable, with contemporary historians such as Romila Thapar suggesting that some of the accounts might be the product of exaggeration from Buddhist missionaries. Thapar attributes purely economic motivations to the Indo-Greek invasion of Southern Asia. =Coinage and connection with Buddhism= Demetrios I trident detail of Gorgon-trident coin. The coins of Demetrius are of five types. One bilingual type with Greek and Kharoshthi legends exists; it is naturally associated with the Indian Demetrius II. A series with the king in diadem are likely to be early issues of Demetrius I. There is also one series representing a Gorgon shield on the obverse and a trident on the reverse. More interesting are the \\"elephant\\" coins: The first type shows Demetrius (I) with elephant-crown, a well-known symbol of India, which simply denotes his conquests in India, as Alexander the Great had also done on his coinage before. =Elephant with Nike= Nike. One type represents an elephant with Nike on the other side holding a wreath of victory. This sort of symbolism can be seen on the reverse of the coins of Antialcidas in which Nike (supported by Zeus) directly hands the victory wreath to the elephant on the same coin face. =Elephant with the caduceus= Coin of Demetrius I with elephant raising trunk and caduceus. Caduceus symbol on a punch-marked coin of the Maurya Empire in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BC. The other \\"elephant\\" type of Demetrius I represents a rejoicing elephant, depicted on the front on the coin and surrounded by the royal bead-and-reel decoration, and therefore treated on the same level as a King. The elephant, one of the symbols of Buddhism and the Gautama Buddha, possibly represents the victory of Buddhism brought about by Demetrius. Alternatively, though, the elephant has been described as a possible symbol of the Indian capital of Taxila (Tarn), or as a symbol of India as a whole. The reverse of the coin depicts the caduceus, symbol of reconciliation between two fighting serpents, which is possibly a representation of peace between the Greeks and the Shungas, and likewise between Buddhism and Hinduism (the caduceus also appears as a symbol of the punch-marked coins of the Maurya Empire in India, in the 3rd-2nd century BC). Unambiguous Buddhist symbols are found on later Greek coins of Menander I or Menander II, but the conquests of Demetrius I did influence the Buddhist religion in India. =Greco-Buddhist art= There are several parallels between Demetrius and the first representations of the Greek Buddha in human form. Also in another parallel, the characteristic protector deity of Demetrius (Herakles standing with his club over his arm, as seen on the reverse of his coins), was represented in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara as the protector deity of the Buddha.

Experimentation in animals began in the early 1900s. , no lasting successes have been achieved. Medical challenges There are three main technical challenges. As with any organ transplant, managing the immune response to avoid transplant rejection is necessary. Also, the brain is highly dependent on continuous flow of blood to provide oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products, with damage setting in quickly at normal temperatures when blood flow is cut off. Finally, managing the nervous systems in both the body and the head is essential, in several ways. The autonomic nervous system controls essential functions like breathing and the heart beating and is governed largely by the brain stem; if the recipient body's head is removed this can no longer function. Additionally each nerve coming out of the head via the spinal cord needs to be connected to the putatively corresponding nerve in the recipient body's spinal cord in order for the brain to control movement and receive sensory information. Finally, the risk of systematic neuropathic pain is high and had largely been unaddressed in research. Of these challenges, dealing with blood supply and transplant rejection have been addressed in the field of transplant medicine generally, making transplantation of several types of organs fairly routine; however in a field as common as liver transplantation around a quarter of organs are rejected within the first year and overall mortality is still much higher than the general population. The challenge of grafting the nervous system remained in early stages of research . History Transplantation of a dog-head performed in the GDR by Vladimir Demikhov on January 13, 1959 Alexis Carrel was a French surgeon who had developed improved surgical methods to connect blood vessels in the context of organ transplantation. In 1908 he collaborated with the American Charles Claude Guthrie to attempt to graft the head of one dog on an intact second dog; the grafted head showed some reflexes early on but deteriorated quickly and the animal was killed after a few hours. Carrel's work on organ transplantation later earned a Nobel Prize; Guthrie was probably excluded because of this controversial work on head transplantation. In 1954, Vladimir Demikhov, a Soviet surgeon who had done important work to improve coronary bypass surgery, performed an experiment in which he grafted a dog's head and upper body including the front legs, onto another dog; the effort was focused on how to provide blood supply to the donor head and upper body and not on grafting the nervous systems. The dogs generally survived a few days; one survived 29 days. The grafted body parts were able to move and react to stimulus. The animals died due to transplant rejection. In the 1950s and '60s, immunosuppressive drugs and organ transplantation techniques were developed that eventually made transplantation of kidneys, livers, and other organs standard medical procedures. In 1965, Robert J. White did a series of experiments in which he attempted to graft only the vascular system of isolated dog brains onto existing dogs, to learn how to manage this challenge. He monitored brain activity with EEG and also monitored metabolism, and showed that he could maintain high levels of brain activity and metabolism by avoiding any break in the blood supply. The animals survived between 6 hours and 2 days. In 1970, he did four experiments in which he cut the head off of a monkey and connected the blood vessels of another monkey head to it; he did not attempt to connect the nervous systems. White used deep hypothermia to protect the brains during the times when they were cut off from blood during procedure. The recipient bodies had to be kept alive with mechanical ventilation and drugs to stimulate the heart. The grafted heads were able to function - the eyes tracked moving objects and it could chew and swallow. There were problems with the grafting of blood vessels that led to blood clots forming, and White used high doses of immunosuppressive drugs that had severe side effects; the animals died between 6 hours and 3 days after the heads were engrafted. These experiments were reported and criticized in the media and were considered barbaric by animal rights activists. There were few animal experiments on head transplantation for many years after this. In 2012, Xiaoping Ren published work in which he grafted the head of a mouse onto another mouse's body; again the focus was on how to avoid harm from the loss of blood supply; with his protocol the grafted heads survived up to six months. In 2013, Sergio Canavero published a protocol that he said would make human head transplantation possible. In 2015, Ren published work in which he cut off the heads of mice but left the brain stem in place, and then connected the vasculature of the donor head to the recipient body; this work was an effort to address whether it was possible to keep the body of the recipient animal alive without life support. All prior experimental work that involved removing the recipient body's head had cut the head off lower down, just below the second bone in the spinal column. Ren also used moderate hypothermia to protect the brains during the procedure. In 2016, Ren and Canavero published a review of attempted as well as possible neuroprotection strategies that they said should be researched for potential use in a head transplantation procedure; they discussed various protocols for connecting the vasculature, the use of various levels of hypothermia, the use of blood substitutes, and the possibility of using hydrogen sulfide as a neuroprotective agent. Ethics and popular opinion Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist, has written \\"Head transplants are fake news. Those who promote such claims and who would subject any human being to unproven cruel surgery merit not headlines but only contempt and condemnation.\\" White became a target for protestors because of his head transplantation experiments. One interrupted a banquet in his honor by offering him a bloody replica of a human head. Others called his house asking for \\"Dr. Butcher\\". When White testified in a civil hearing about Dr. Sam Sheppard's murder case, lawyer Terry Gilbert compared Dr. White to Dr. Frankenstein.Grant Segall, Dr. Robert J. White, famous neurosurgeron and ethicist, dies at 84, The Plain Dealer, (September 16, 2010). The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals described White's experiments as \\"epitomizing the crude, cruel vivisection industry\\".Carla Bennett, Cruel and Unneeded, The New York Times, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, (August 21, 1995). In general the field of transplantation medicine has been met with resistance and alarm from some quarters as advances have been made; Joseph Murray, who performed the first kidney transplant in 1954, was described as doing something unnatural or as playing God. These continued as other organs were transplanted, but perhaps became the most sharp as hand transplants and face transplants emerged in 1998 and 2005, as each of these are visible, personal, and social in ways that internal organs are not. The medical ethics of each of these procedures was extensively discussed and worked out before clinical experimental and regular usage began. With regard to head transplantation, there had been little formal ethical discussion published in the literature and little dialogue among stakeholders ; the plans of Canavero were running well ahead of society's and the medical establishment's readiness or acceptance. There was no accepted protocol for conducting the procedure to justify the risk to the people involved, methods of obtaining informed consent were unclear, especially for the person whose body would be used; issues of desperation render the truly informed consent of a head donor questionable. With regard to societal costs, the body of a person willing to be an organ donor can save the lives of many people, and the supply of tissues and organs from people willing to be organ donors did not meet the medical need of recipients; the notion of an entire donor body going to one other person was difficult to justify at that time. Basic legal issues were also unclear with regard to whether only one or both of the people involved in a head transplantation would have any legal rights in the post-procedure person. The most appropriate initial form of the procedure was unclear . Because grafting the head onto the spinal cord was not possible at that time, the only feasible procedure would be one where the head was only connected to the blood supply of the donor body, leaving the person completely paralyzed, with the accompanying limited quality of life and high societal cost to maintain. The psychological results of the procedure were unclear as well. While concerns were raised about whether recipients of a face transplant and their social circle would have difficulty adjusting, studies had found that disruptions had been minimal. But no transplant had ever been performed where the entire body of an individual is unfamiliar at the conclusion of the procedure, and one of the few documents discussing the ethics in the biomedical literature, a letter to the editor of a journal published in 2015, foresaw a high risk of insanity as a result of the procedure. Popular opinion about Canavero's plans for head transplantation had been generally negative . Many of these criticisms focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.

He is known for blending traditional honky-tonk and mainstream country pop sounds (for a style widely regarded as ‚Äúneotraditional country‚Äù), as well as penning many of his own songs. Jackson has recorded 16 studio albums, three greatest hits albums, two Christmas albums, and two gospel albums. Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all-time, having sold over 75 million records worldwide, with 44 million sold in the United States alone. He has had 66 songs appear on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart; of the 66 titles, and six featured singles, 38 have reached the top five and 35 have claimed the number one spot. Out of 15 titles to reach the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, nine have been certified multi- platinum. He is the recipient of two Grammy Awards, 16 CMA Awards, 17 ACM Awards and nominee of multiple other awards. He is a member of the Grand Ole Opry, and was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 2001. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2017 by Loretta Lynn and into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2018. Early life Jackson was born to Joseph Eugene \\"Daddy Gene\\" Jackson (1927‚Äì2000) and Ruth Musick \\"Mama Ruth\\" Jackson (1930‚Äì2017) in Newnan, Georgia, and has four older sisters. He and his immediate family lived in a small home built around his grandfather's old toolshed. The family is primarily of English descent. His mother lived in the home until she died on January 7, 2017. He began writing music in 1983. Growing up, Jackson listened primarily to gospel music, until a friend introduced him to Gene Watson, John Anderson, and Hank Williams Jr. Jackson attended the local Elm Street Elementary and Newnan High School, and joined the band, Dixie Steel after graduation. When he was 27, Jackson and his wife of six years, Denise, moved from Newnan to Nashville, Tennessee, where he hoped to pursue music full-time. In 1987, Jackson cut an album titled New Traditional at Doc's Place in Hendersonville, Tennessee, but it is extremely rare and was only released in Japan. Career In Tennessee, Jackson got his first job in The Nashville Network's mailroom. His wife Denise was a flight attendant. While working she came in contact with Glen Campbell and requested advice for her husband. Campbell handed her his business card of his manager and told her to call, which helped jumpstart his career.Sanz, C.; J. Sanderson (September 2, 1991), \\"Honky-tonk hero\\". People. 36 (8):76. Jackson eventually signed with Arista, and in 1989, he became the first artist signed to the newly formed Arista Nashville branch of Arista Records. Arista released Jackson's debut single, \\"Blue Blooded Woman\\", in late 1989. Although the song failed to reach top 40 on Hot Country Songs, he reached number three by early 1990 with \\"Here in the Real World\\". This song served as the title track to his debut studio album, Here in the Real World, which also included two more top five hits (\\"Wanted\\" and \\"Chasin' That Neon Rainbow\\") and his first number one, \\"I'd Love You All Over Again\\". Don't Rock the Jukebox was the title of Jackson's second album. Released in 1991, it included four number-one singles: the title track, \\"Someday\\", \\"Dallas\\" and \\"Love's Got a Hold on You\\", and the number three \\"Midnight in Montgomery\\". Jackson also co-wrote several songs on Randy Travis' 1991 album High Lonesome. A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love), his third album, accounted for the number one hits \\"She's Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)\\" (which Randy Travis co-wrote) and \\"Chattahoochee\\", plus the top five hits \\"Tonight I Climbed the Wall\\", \\"Mercury Blues\\" and \\"(Who Says) You Can't Have It All\\". \\"Chattahoochee\\" also won him the 1994 Country Music Association (CMA) awards for Single and Song of the Year.

The album also included the number one hit \\"There Goes\\" and a number two cover of Charly McClain's 1980 single \\"Who's Cheatin' Who\\". The album's fifth single was \\"A House with No Curtains\\", which became his first release since 1989 to miss the top 10. 1998's High Mileage was led off by the number four \\"I'll Go On Loving You\\". After it came the album's only number one hit, \\"Right on the Money\\", co-written by Phil Vassar and Charlie Black. With Jackson's release of Under the Influence in 1999, he took the double risk on an album of covers of country classics while retaining a traditional sound when a rock- and pop-tinged sound dominated country radio.Flippo, Chet (September 25, 1999), \\"Jackson returns to roots with traditional set; Arista/Nashville seeks sound's revival\\".

Jackson considered this album a \\"side project\\" and nothing too official, but it was ultimately treated as such. More than 1.8 million units were eventually sold. Jackson performing in 2005 Just a few months later, Jackson released his next album, Like Red on a Rose. Originally intended to be a bluegrass album, Like Red on a Rose had a different producer and sound. Keith Stegall, was notably absent from this album and instead, Alison Krauss took over the producing reins. Unlike Jackson's previous albums, the album abandoned Jackson's typical neotraditional country style and instead, went for a soft rock/adult contemporary sound. This move proved controversial for his fans, who accused him of abandoning his signature style in order to go for a more commercial pop route. Although critically acclaimed, the album was considered a commercial disappointment for the singer. For his next album, he went back to his country roots. Good Time was released on March 4, 2008. The album's first single, \\"Small Town Southern Man\\", was released to radio on November 19, 2007. \\"Country Boy\\", \\"Good Time\\", \\"Sissy's Song\\" and \\"I Still Like Bologna\\", were also released as singles. \\"Sissy's Song\\" is dedicated to a longtime friend of the Jackson family (Leslie \\"Sissy\\" Fitzgerald) who worked in their house every day. Fitzgerald was killed in a motorcycle accident in mid-2007. =2010s= Jackson performing in 2012 His sixteenth studio album, Freight Train, was released on March 30, 2010.

On January 20, 2011, Sony Music Nashville announced that Jackson and his Sony-owned record label, Arista Nashville, had parted. In March of that year, Jackson announced his new deal with Capitol's EMI Records Nashville. It was a joint venture between ACR (Alan's Country Records) and Capitol. All records were to be released and marketed through Capitol's EMI Records Nashville label. In 2012, Jackson released the album Thirty Miles West. Three singles have been released from the album, \\"Long Way to Go\\", \\"So You Don't Have to Love Me Anymore\\" and \\"You Go Your Way\\". None of the singles reached the top 20. A tour in 2013 supported the album. Jackson released his second gospel album, Precious Memories Volume II, on March 26, 2013. Later that same year, Jackson released his first (and so far, only) bluegrass album, simply titled The Bluegrass Album. Two singles were released from the album: \\"Blue Ridge Mountain Song\\" and \\"Blacktop\\". The album eventually peaked at no. 1 on the Billboard Top Bluegrass Albums chart and no. 3 on the country chart. In 2014, Jackson recorded the opening credits song, \\"A Million Ways to Die\\", for the film A Million Ways to Die in the West, co-writing the song with Seth MacFarlane and Joel McNeely.

People. 49 (9):48. they have since reconciled. Their story is referenced in several of Jackson's songs, including \\"She Likes It Too\\" and \\"Remember When,\\" based on his memories, and the fond views of an everlasting love between his wife and him. Denise and their daughters appear in the latter song's video. Denise Jackson wrote a book that topped The New York Times Best Seller list about her life with Jackson, their relationship, their separation over his infidelity and recommitment to each other, and her commitment to Christianity. The book, It's All About Him: Finding the Love of My Life, was published in 2007. In May 2008 she released a Gift Book titled \\"The Road Home.\\" Jackson's nephew, Adam Wright, is also a country music singer-songwriter. Adam and his wife, Shannon, perform together as a duo called The Wrights. The Wrights co-wrote two songs and sang harmony vocals on Jackson's What I Do album. Jackson is a cousin of former Major League Baseball player Brandon Moss. In June 2009, Jackson listed his estate just outside Franklin, Tennessee, for sale, asking $38 million. The property sold in late May 2010 for $28 million, one of the highest prices ever for a home sale in the Nashville area. In 2010, after Jackson moved his estate just outside Franklin, the singer then moved into a home in the same Nashville suburb. The singer and his wife paid $3.675 million for the estate in June 2010, but less than a year later they listed the home for $3.995 million. Jackson maintained a close friendship with fellow country singer, George Jones. Jones has been mentioned in songs such as \\"Don't Rock the Jukebox\\" (Jones also appeared in the video which accompanied it) and \\"Murder on Music Row.\\" The song \\"Just Playin' Possum\\" is dedicated to Jones and talks of how Alan only wants to lie low and play possum, possum referring to George Jones. Jones can also be seen in the video for \\"Good Time.\\" In 2008, Jones was a surprise guest at Jackson's \\"CMT Giants\\" ceremony, where he thanked Jackson for his friendship. He's also close friends with George Strait, who sang \\"Murder on Music Row\\" with him. Besides his associations with big stars, Alan also maintains his connections to his roots and old friends.Tyler Moreland, March 8, 2008, Times-Herald,\\" Community Edition, \\"Highway Renamed\\" From his early days of playing the guitar with his old high school friend and fellow musician David \\"Bird\\" Burgess on the Burgess' family front porch, it was evident Alan was going to be Newnan's rising star. While \\"Bird\\" Burgess has left the country music scene to pursue other avenues, the two have remained friends. At George Jones' funeral service, on May 2, 2013, Jackson performed one of Jones' classics, \\"He Stopped Loving Her Today,\\" at the close of the service at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. An avid classic car collector, Jackson's collection includes an Amphicar, a 1968 Shelby GT 500 KR Convertible and a 1970 Chevelle SS 396, among others.

Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but he later took to writing. His major works include the novels The Thief's Journal and Our Lady of the Flowers, and the plays The Balcony, The Maids and The Screens.Contemporary Literary Criticism, Volume 45 By Daniel G. Marowski, Roger Matuz. Gale: 1987 pg 11 Biography=Early life= Genet's mother was a prostitute who raised him for the first seven months of his life before placing him for adoption. Thereafter Genet was raised in the provincial town of Alligny-en-Morvan, in the Ni√®vre department of central France. His foster family was headed by a carpenter and, according to Edmund White's biography, was loving and attentive. While he received excellent grades in school, his childhood involved a series of attempts at running away and incidents of petty theft. After the death of his foster mother, Genet was placed with an elderly couple but remained with them less than two years. According to the wife, \\"he was going out nights and also seemed to be wearing makeup.\\" On one occasion he squandered a considerable sum of money, which they had entrusted him for delivery elsewhere, on a visit to a local fair. =Detention and military service= For this and other misdemeanors, including repeated acts of vagrancy, he was sent at the age of 15 to Mettray Penal Colony where he was detained between 2 September 1926 and 1 March 1929. In Miracle of the Rose (1946), he gives an account of this period of detention, which ended at the age of 18 when he joined the Foreign Legion. He was eventually given a dishonorable discharge on grounds of indecency (having been caught engaged in a homosexual act) and spent a period as a vagabond, petty thief and prostitute across Europe‚Äîexperiences he recounts in The Thief's Journal (1949). =Criminal career, prison, and prison writings= After returning to Paris, France in 1937, Genet was in and out of prison through a series of arrests for theft, use of false papers, vagabondage, lewd acts, and other offenses. In prison, Genet wrote his first poem, \\"Le condamn√© √† mort\\", which he had printed at his own cost, and the novel Our Lady of the Flowers (1944). In Paris, Genet sought out and introduced himself to Jean Cocteau, who was impressed by his writing. Cocteau used his contacts to get Genet's novel published, and in 1949, when Genet was threatened with a life sentence after ten convictions, Cocteau and other prominent figures, including Jean-Paul Sartre and Pablo Picasso, successfully petitioned the French President to have the sentence set aside. Genet would never return to prison. =Writing and activism= By 1949, Genet had completed five novels, three plays, and numerous poems, many controversial for their explicit and often deliberately provocative portrayal of homosexuality and criminality. Sartre wrote a long analysis of Genet's existential development (from vagrant to writer), entitled Saint Genet (1952), which was anonymously published as the first volume of Genet's complete works. Genet was strongly affected by Sartre's analysis and did not write for the next five years. Between 1955 and 1961, Genet wrote three more plays as well as an essay called \\"What Remains of a Rembrandt Torn into Four Equal Pieces and Flushed Down the Toilet\\", on which hinged Jacques Derrida's analysis of Genet in his seminal work Glas. During this time, Genet became emotionally attached to Abdallah Bentaga, a tightrope walker. However, following a number of accidents and his suicide in 1964, Genet entered a period of depression, and even attempted suicide himself.Brian Gordon Kennelly, Unfinished Business: Tracing Incompletion in Jean Genet's Posthumously Published Plays (Rodopi, 1997) p22 From the late 1960s, starting with an homage to Daniel Cohn-Bendit after the events of May 1968, Genet became politically active. He participated in demonstrations drawing attention to the living conditions of immigrants in France. Genet was censored in the United States in 1968 and later expelled when they refused him a visa. In an interview with Edward de Grazia, professor of law and First Amendment lawyer, Genet discusses the time he went through Canada for the Chicago congress. He entered without a visa and left with no issues. In 1970, the Black Panthers invited him to the United States, where he stayed for three months giving lectures, attended the trial of their leader, Huey Newton, and published articles in their journals. Later the same year he spent six months in Palestinian refugee camps, secretly meeting Yasser Arafat near Amman. Profoundly moved by his experiences in the United States and Jordan, Genet wrote a final lengthy memoir about his experiences, Prisoner of Love, which would be published posthumously. Genet also supported Angela Davis and George Jackson, as well as Michel Foucault and Daniel Defert's Prison Information Group. He worked with Foucault and Sartre to protest police brutality against Algerians in Paris, a problem persisting since the Algerian War of Independence, when beaten bodies were to be found floating in the Seine. Genet expresses his solidarity with the Red Army Faction (RAF) of Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, in the article \\"Violence et brutalit√©\\", published in Le Monde, 1977. In September 1982, Genet was in Beirut when the massacres took place in the Palestinian camps of Sabra and Shatila. In response, Genet published \\"Quatre heures √† Chatila\\" (\\"Four Hours in Shatila\\"), an account of his visit to Shatila after the event. In one of his rare public appearances during the later period of his life, at the invitation of Austrian philosopher Hans K√∂chler, he read from his work during the inauguration of an exhibition on the massacre of Sabra and Shatila organized by the International Progress Organization in Vienna, Austria, on 19 December 1983. =Death= Genet developed throat cancer and was found dead at Jack‚Äôs Hotel in Paris on 15 April 1986 where his photograph and books remain. Genet may have fallen on the floor and fatally hit his head. He is buried in the Larache Christian Cemetery in Larache, Morocco. Genet's works=Novels and autobiography= Throughout his five early novels, Genet works to subvert the traditional set of moral values of his assumed readership. He celebrates a beauty in evil, emphasizes his singularity, raises violent criminals to icons, and enjoys the specificity of gay gesture and coding and the depiction of scenes of betrayal. Our Lady of the Flowers (Notre Dame des Fleurs 1943) is a journey through the prison underworld, featuring a fictionalized alter-ego by the name of Divine, usually referred to in the feminine, at the center of a circle of tantes (\\"aunties\\" or \\"queens\\") with colorful sobriquets such as Mimosa I, Mimosa II, First Communion and the Queen of Rumania. The two auto-fictional novels, Miracle of the Rose (Miracle de la rose 1946) and The Thief's Journal (Journal du voleur 1949), describe Genet's time in Mettray Penal Colony and his experiences as a vagabond and prostitute across Europe. Querelle de Brest (1947) is set in the midst of the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder; and Funeral Rites (1949) is a story of love and betrayal across political divides, written this time for the narrator's lover, Jean Decarnin, killed by the Germans in WWII. Prisoner of Love, published in 1986, after Genet's death, is a memoir of his encounters with Palestinian fighters and Black Panthers; it has, therefore, a more documentary tone than his fiction. =Art criticism= Genet wrote an essay on the work of the Swiss sculptor and artist Alberto Giacometti titled L'Atelier d'Alberto Giacometti. It was highly praised by major artists, including Giacometti and Picasso. Genet wrote in an informal style, incorporating excerpts of conversations between himself and Giacometti. Genet's biographer Edmund White said that, rather than write in the style of an art historian, Genet \\"invented a whole new language for discussing\\" Giacometti, proposing \\"that the statues of Giacometti should be offered to the dead, and that they should be buried.\\"Kirili, Alain. \\"Edmund White\\" . BOMB Magazine. Spring 1994. Retrieved 25 July 2011. =Plays= Genet's plays present highly stylized depictions of ritualistic struggles between outcasts of various kinds and their oppressors.See Martin Esslin's book for one perspective on Genet's relationship both to Artaud's 'Theatre of Cruelty' and to Esslin's own Theatre of the Absurd. Not all critics agree that Artaud is Genet's most significant influence; both Bertolt Brecht and Luigi Pirandello have also been identified. Social identities are parodied and shown to involve complex layering through manipulation of the dramatic fiction and its inherent potential for theatricality and role-play; maids imitate one another and their mistress in The Maids (1947); or the clients of a brothel simulate roles of political power before, in a dramatic reversal, actually becoming those figures, all surrounded by mirrors that both reflect and conceal, in The Balcony (1957). Most strikingly, Genet offers a critical dramatisation of what Aim√© C√©saire called negritude in The Blacks (1959), presenting a violent assertion of Black identity and anti-white virulence framed in terms of mask-wearing and roles adopted and discarded. His most overtly political play is The Screens (1964), an epic account of the Algerian War of Independence. He also wrote another full-length drama, Splendid's, in 1948 and a one-act play, Her (Elle), in 1955, though neither was published or produced during Genet's lifetime. The Blacks was, after The Balcony, the second of Genet's plays to be staged in New York. The production was the longest running Off-Broadway non-musical of the decade. Originally premiered in Paris in 1959, this 1961 New York production ran for 1,408 performances. The original cast featured James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Browne, Louis Gossett, Jr., Cicely Tyson, Godfrey Cambridge, Maya Angelou and Charles Gordone. =Film= In 1950, Genet directed Un Chant d'Amour, a 26-minute black-and-white film depicting the fantasies of a gay male prisoner and his prison warden. Genet is also credited as co-director of the West German television documentary Am Anfang war der Dieb (1984), along with his co-stars Hans Neuenfels and Fran√ßois Bondy. Genet's work has been adapted for film and produced by other filmmakers. In 1982, Rainer Werner Fassbinder released Querelle, his final film, based on Querelle of Brest. It starred Brad Davis, Jeanne Moreau and Franco Nero. Tony Richardson directed Mademoiselle, which was based on a short story by Genet. It starred Jeanne Moreau with the screenplay written by Marguerite Duras. Todd Haynes' Poison was based on the writings of Genet. Several of Genet's plays were adapted into films. The Balcony (1963), directed by Joseph Strick, starred Shelley Winters as Madame Irma, Peter Falk, Lee Grant and Leonard Nimoy. The Maids was filmed in 1974 and starred Glenda Jackson, Susannah York and Vivien Merchant. Italian director Salvatore Samperi in 1986 directed another adaptation for film of the same play, La Bonne (Eng. Corruption), starring Florence Guerin and Katrine Michelsen.  Legacy  Jean Genet managed to make an unlikely appearance by proxy in the pop charts when in 1972, David Bowie released his popular hit single \\"The Jean Genie\\". In his book Moonage Daydream (2005), Bowie confirmed that the title \\"...was a clumsy pun upon Jean Genet\\".David Bowie & Mick Rock (2005). Moonage Daydream: pp. 140‚Äì146 A later promo video combines a version of the song with a fast edit of Genet's 1950 movie Un Chant d'Amour (1950). Dire Straits' Making Movies (released on 17 October 1980 by Vertigo Records internationally and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States.) refers to Jean Genet in \\"Les Boys\\": Late at night when they've gone away/Les boys dream of Jean Genet/High heel shoes and a black beret/And the posters on the wall that say/Les boys do cabaret/Les boys are glad to be gay. Jean Genet is mentioned twice in the lyrics to the song \\"A Cocaine Christmas and an Alcoholic's New Year\\" which features on the second studio album, Suicide Songs (2016, Bella Union) by the English band Money: Like they're Marilyn Monroe at a cocktail party/I'm someone outrageous like Jean Genet...I am Marilyn Monroe I am a cocktail party/I'm someone ugly, beautiful like Jean Genet.

IIT Bombay was founded in 1958. In 1961, the Parliament decreed IITs as Institutes of National Importance. A committee formed by the Government of India recommended the establishment of four higher institutes of technology to set the direction for the development of technical education in the country in 1946. Planning began in 1957 and the first batch of 100 students was admitted in 1958. Since its establishment in Powai, the institute has physically expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than 2.2 square kilometers. IIT Bombay is known for its 4 Year, 5 Year & 2 Year programmes for which the entry is through the Joint Entrance Examination ‚Äì Advanced and Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering. It offers degrees such as: Bachelor of Technology, Four Year Bachelor of Science, Five Year Master of Science, 2 or 3 Year Master of Technology, and a few others. It also has a comprehensive graduate program offering doctoral degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. It currently has a total of 15 academic departments, 20 centres, a school of excellence and four interdisciplinary programs including a Management Program. History IIT Bombay was the second Indian Institutes of Technology to be established in 1958 with assistance from UNESCO and with funds contributed by the Soviet Union. UNESCO agreed to provide equipment and technical experts mainly from the Soviet Union, while the Government of India accepted the responsibility for all other expenses including the cost of the building project and recurring expenses. The site chosen for the institute was Powai with an area of which was given by the then Bombay State Government. While construction was being completed, the first academic session of the Institute opened on 25 July 1958, in its temporary home at the Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) building in Worli with 100 students. These students were selected from over 3,400 applicants for admission to the first year undergraduate engineering programmes of Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Energy, Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering, and MSc Chemistry. One of the main objectives of establishing the institute was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialized engineering and technological sciences. The need for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years. While the institute was functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10 March. In 2018, IIT Bombay was one of the first six institutes to be awarded the Institute of Eminence status.  Campus  The IIT Bombay campus, having an area of about 550 acres, is located at Powai, in East Mumbai, between the Vihar and Powai lakes. The campus is divided into clusters of buildings. The academic area chiefly comprises the main building, various departmental annexes and auditoria. All department annexes are connected by a corridor named Infinite Corridor. Beyond the Convocation Hall lie most of the hostels. There are a total of 18 hostels, of which two hostels (Hostels 10 and 11) and a wing of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 15) are for female students. Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has significant green cover and is mostly untouched by the pollution of the rest of the city. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to occasional sightings of panthers, leopards and Gharial (Gavialis gangeticus) crocodiles along the banks of the Powai lake. Sometimes they stray into the campus in chase of hunt. The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey and cricket grounds; and tennis, basketball, squash and volleyball courts. It also has a Students' Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and other extracurricular activities. In addition to these facilities, the campus also houses two high schools, one of which is a Kendriya Vidyalaya and the other is called IIT Campus School.

Career Jorge Ramos in 2014 Ramos worked for Grupo Televisa's flagship XEW-TV in Mexico City for the network's local version of 60 Minutes. At the age of 24, he quit that job after a story he produced that was critical of Mexico's government was censored. In 1983, he left Mexico on a student visa for Los Angeles, where he planned to enroll in the UCLA Extension's journalism classes. In 1984, he was hired by KMEX-TV, an affiliate of what was then the Spanish International Network (SIN) in Los Angeles, which operated on a shoestring budget in a run- down facility on Melrose Avenue. At KMEX, Ramos felt he could express himself freely: \\"To me it was a palace... the United States gave me opportunities that my country of origin could not: freedom of the press and complete freedom of expression.\\" Two years later, he became the host for KMEX's morning program, Mundo Latino.

When Univision held its own forums with candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, Ramos challenged both of them on their immigration policies, specifically Romney's \\"self-deportation\\" policy, which Ramos considered an insult to Latinos, and Obama's deportation of more than 1.4 million people, and his reneging on his promise to address immigration during his first term. Washington Monthly named Ramos the broadcaster who would most determine the 2012 presidential election. Ramos' increased notability, however, led to criticism of his advocacy approach. To this Ramos has stated, \\"Our position is clearly pro-Latino or pro-immigrant ... We are simply being the voice of those who don't have a voice.\\" Ramos interviewing Democratic presidential candidate and United States senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders, January 2016 In 2015, after Donald Trump became a presidential candidate, Ramos pursued an interview with Trump for months. When he sent Trump a handwritten request in June, Trump, who had filed a lawsuit against Univision over its decision to drop the Miss Universe pageant following the candidate's comments about Mexican immigrants, posted Ramos's letter on Instagram, which exposed Ramos's cell phone number. Trump later deleted the post. On August 25, 2015, Ramos attended a news conference held in Dubuque, Iowa, by Trump. Prior to attending, Ramos studied previous Trump press conferences and discovered a pattern of Trump repetitively interjecting \\"excuse me\\" and calling on another reporter when asked a question opposing his beliefs. Due to this knowledge, Ramos refused to sit down and persistently continued questioning Trump about his immigration policies when rebuffed. Ramos insisted on his rights as a reporter and United States citizen to ask a question, prompting Trump's Head of Security Keith Schiller to push him backwards out of the conference room. About 15 minutes later, Trump allowed Ramos to return to the conference, where he and Trump engaged in a heated exchange on the issue. Trump later explained that he had not called on Ramos for a question, as he had called on another reporter in the audience. Ramos accused Trump of \\"spreading hate\\" with his calls for mass deportations of undocumented families, and repealing birthright citizenship, and questioned the feasibility of Trump's proposals. He also questioned Trump's viability as a candidate among Latino voters, citing a poll indicating that 75% of those voters held unfavorable opinions of him,\\"Trump clashes with reporter: who was wrong?\\" Morning Joe.

Ramos moderating the alt= The press conference incident inspired Ramos to create his documentary Hate Rising focused on increasing incidents of racial bigotry and violence across the country, which aired October 23, 2016, on Univision and Fusion. In preparation for the documentary, Ramos met with members of various hate groups across the country including Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis, along with Latino and Muslim victims. His journey lasted nine months, often placing him in danger as both an immigrant and a Mexican-American man. In order to gain face time with members of white supremacist groups, Ramos partnered with director Catherine Tambini, an American who the groups were under the impression they would be speaking to, and only right before the interview started did Ramos sit down to ask questions. In 2016, Ramos began leveraging Facebook Live to stream raw footage taken on his phone to social media audiences, gaining 2.6 million views on his Iowa caucus videos and over four million on his reports during the New Hampshire primaries. On February 25, 2019, he was held with his journalistic group in the Miraflores Palace after an interview with Nicol√°s Maduro. After seizing the equipment and interview recordings, he was released hours later and deported from the country. During the interview, Maduro denied there was a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, which led Ramos to show Maduro images of Venezuelans eating garbage to point out that there was indeed a crisis. After being released, Ramos stated that he and his group were held because this action bothered Maduro. The Information Minister of Maduro, Jorge Rodr√≠guez, described the incident as a \\"cheap show.\\" On April 12, 2019, his intervention in the morning conference of Mexican president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador was controversial over the confrontation he held with L√≥pez Obrador, around homicide figures in Mexico in the period of the administration. The episode opened a debate on the use of figures of malicious homicides in Mexico and its different sources. He interviewed Fidel Castro, confronted Obama on deportations, confronted Trump and is reportedly an admirer of Oriana Fallaci. Personal life Ramos earned a master's degree in international studies at the University of Miami in Florida. In 2008, Ramos became a United States citizen, after many years of feeling personally conflicted over the matter. He had long considered himself just another \\"Mexican with a green card.\\" That year, however, his 50th birthday, he had lived in Mexico 25 years and 25 years in the United States, and came to a realization, explaining, \\"You have to go through a mental and emotional process to recognize who you really are,\\" Ramos said. \\"I finally recognized that I cannot be defined by one country.

One of the most popular characters in the history of French crime fiction, Fant√¥mas was created in 1911 and appeared in a total of 32 volumes written by the two collaborators, then a subsequent 11 volumes written by Allain alone after Souvestre's death. The character was also the basis of various film, television, and comic book adaptations. In the history of crime fiction, he represents a transition from Gothic novel villains of the 19th century to modern-day serial killers. The books and movies that came out in quick succession anticipate current production methods of Hollywood, in two respects: First, the authors distributed the writing among themselves; their \\"working method was to draw up the general plot between them and then go off and write alternate chapters independently of each other, meeting up to tie the two halves of the story together in the final chapter.\\" This approach allowed the authors to produce almost one novel per month. Second, the movie rights to the books were immediately snapped up. Such a system ensured that the film studio could produce sequels reliably. The popular depiction of Fant√¥mas as wearing a blue mask, black gloves, and using technological devices did not originate in the novels, but is a result of the popularity of the trilogy of Fant√¥mas movies directed by Andr√© Hunebelle in the 1960s. The trilogy, which started in 1964 with Fant√¥mas, departed considerably from the novels by giving the story a more comedic tone as preceded by the first two Pink Panther films, and by making Fant√¥mas (played by Jean Marais) more of a James Bond enemy by likewise borrowing from the first two Bond films. Despite these discrepancies, the blue-masked Fant√¥mas is arguably the one that is most easily remembered. Overview A poster for the third Fant√¥mas serial by Louis Feuillade. Fant√¥mas wears his iconic black hood and black leotard, more sinister features than the traditional gentleman thief's domino mask and tuxedo. Fant√¥mas is a criminal genius, ruthless and particularly elusive. As described by Sch√ºtt (2003) in her analysis of French crime fiction literature, Fant√¥mas is the cause of almost any unsolved crime, a merciless criminal who can get away with his evil deeds by impersonating pretty much anyone. He is obsessively chased by Inspector Juve, who is generally the only one able to see Fant√¥mas's tracks. Fant√¥mas was introduced a few years after Ars√®ne Lupin, another well- known thief. But whereas Lupin draws the line at murder, Fant√¥mas has no such qualms and is shown as a sociopath who enjoys killing in a sadistic fashion. He is totally ruthless, shows no mercy, and is loyal to none, not even his own children. He is a master of disguise, always appearing under an assumed identity, often that of a person whom he has murdered. Fant√¥mas makes use of bizarre and improbable techniques in his crimes, such as plague-infested rats, giant snakes, and rooms that fill with sand. Fant√¥mas's background remains vague. He might be of British and/or French ancestry. He appears to have been born in 1867. In the books, it is established that c. 1892, the man who later became Fant√¥mas called himself Archduke Juan North and operated in the German principality of Hesse-Weimar. There he fathered a child, Vladimir, with an unidentified noblewoman. In circumstances unrevealed, he was arrested and sent to prison. C. 1895, Fant√¥mas was in India. There, an unidentified European woman gave birth to a baby girl, H√©l√®ne, whose father might be Fant√¥mas or an Indian prince who was Fant√¥mas' acolyte. The girl was raised in South Africa. In 1897, Fant√¥mas was in the United States of America and Mexico. There, he ruined his then business partner, Etienne Rambert. In 1899, he fought in the Second Boer War in South Africa under the name of Gurn. He fought in the Transvaal as an artillery sergeant under the command of Lord Roberts. He became aide-de-camp to Lord Edward Beltham of Scottwell Hill and fell in love with his younger wife, Lady Maud Beltham. Upon their return to Europe, soon before the first novel begins (c. 1900), Gurn and Lady Beltham were surprised in their Paris love nest, Rue Levert, by her husband. Lord Beltham was about to shoot Maud when Gurn hit him with a hammer then strangled him. Fant√¥mas then impersonated Etienne Rambert and framed his son, Charles, for a murder he had committed. As Etienne, he persuaded Charles to go into hiding, but the young man was soon found out by French police detective Juve, who was truly obsessed with the capture of Fant√¥mas. Juve knew that Charles was innocent and gave him a new identity: journalist Jer√¥me Fandor who is employed at the newspaper La Capitale. Juve later arrested Gurn and, at his trial, brought forward a convincing argument that Gurn and Fant√¥mas were one and the same, though the evidence was too circumstantial to make a real case. On the eve of his execution, Gurn/Fant√¥mas escaped from custody by being replaced by an actor who had modelled the appearance of his latest character after him and was guillotined in his place. Lady Beltham remained constantly torn between her passion for the villain and her horror at his criminal schemes. She eventually committed suicide in 1910. Fandor fell in love with H√©l√®ne and, despite Fant√¥mas's repeated attempts to break them up, married her. Fant√¥mas's evil son, Vladimir, reappeared in 1911. Vladimir's girlfriend was murdered by Fant√¥mas and Vladimir himself was eventually shot by Juve.  Characters  * Fant√¥mas: A criminal genius, known by many nicknames, such as \\"the \\"master of everything and everyone,\\" the \\"torturer\\" or the \\"elusive\\", and whose face and true identity remain unknown.

The first Fant√¥mas book cover, showing a contemplative masked man dressed in evening dress and holding a dagger, boldly stepping over Paris, is so well known that it has become a visual clich√©. * The novel The Yellow Document, or Fant√¥mas of Berlin by Marcel Allain (1919), despite its title, is not a Fant√¥mas novel. * The last novel written by Allain was published as a newspaper serial, but never appeared in book form. * During the 1980s, the first two novels of the series were published in revised English translations: Fant√¥mas appeared in 1986 with an introduction by American poet John Ashbery; and Juve contre Fant√¥mas appeared in 1987 under the title The Silent Executioner, with an introduction by American artist Edward Gorey. Films A poster for the first Fant√¥mas serial by Louis Feuillade. In the original illustration for the first Fant√¥mas book cover, the character holds a bloody dagger in his free hand. It was also used for the DVD box cover, but this time Fant√¥mas stamps over a photo of modern-day Paris. =Silent serials= * 1. Fant√¥mas (1913) * 2. Juve Contre Fant√¥mas (1913) * 3. Le Mort Qui Tue (1913) * 4. Fant√¥mas Contre Fant√¥mas (1914) * 5. Le Faux Magistrat (1914) The silent film pioneer Louis Feuillade directed five Fant√¥mas serials starring Ren√© Navarre as Fant√¥mas, Br√©on as Juve, Georges Melchior as Fandor, and Ren√©e Carl as Lady Beltham. They are regarded as masterpieces of silent film. His later serial Les Vampires, which concerns the eponymous crime syndicate (and not actual vampires) is also reminiscent of the Fant√¥mas series. There was a 1920 20-episode American Fant√¥mas serial directed by Edward Sedgwick starring Edward Roseman as Fant√¥mas, which bore little resemblance to the French series. In it, Fant√¥mas's nemesis is detective Fred Dixon, played by John Willard. It was partially released in France (12 episodes only) under the title Les Exploits de Diabolos (The Exploits of Diabolos). A novelization of this serial was written by David Lee White for Black Coat Press under the title Fant√¥mas in America in 2007. =Other films= Jean Marais as Fant√¥mas in the 1964 film.

Their tone was generally much more light-hearted than the novels' and the characters were updated in a James Bond-like style including Bond-type gadgets like the flying Citro√´n DS of Fant√¥mas with retractable wings that converts to an airplane. * 11. Fant√¥mas se d√©cha√Æne (1965) * 12.

Television A ' series of four 90-minute episodes was produced in 1980 starring Helmut Berger as Fant√¥mas, Jacques Dufilho as Juve, and Gayle Hunnicutt as Lady Beltham. Episodes 1 and 4 were directed by Claude Chabrol; episodes 2 and 3 by Luis Bu√±uel's son, Juan Luis Bu√±uel. The French movie version of Fant√¥mas appears in the Czechoslovakian 1979-1981 children fantasy series Arabela as well as its sequel series Arabela se vrac√≠, performed respectively by actors Franti≈°ek Peterka and Pavel Nov√Ω. In this version, he does not perform a villain's role, but becomes an ally and friend of the protagonists. Fant√¥mas also has a cameo appearance in the Czech children's series Lucie, postrach ulice as a TV character, where he resembles his original 1911 book serial covers' depiction. Comic books=French= * \\"Fant√¥mas contre les Nains\\". A weekly color page written by Marcel Allain and drawn by Santini was published in Gavroche #24-30 (1941). This series was interrupted because of censorship; a sequel, Fant√¥mas et l'Enfer Sous-Marin was written but not published. * A daily \\"Fant√¥mas\\" strip drawn by Pierre Tabary was syndicated by Opera Mundi from November 1957 to March 1958 (192 strips in total), adapting the first two novels. * Seventeen Fant√¥mas fumetti magazines adapting books 1, 2, 3, and 5 were published by Del Duca in 1962 and 1963. * A new weekly \\"Fant√¥mas\\" color page, written by Agn√®s Guilloteau and drawn by Jacques Taillefer, was again syndicated by Opera Mundi in 1969 and published in Jours de France. * Finally, a series of Fant√¥mas graphic novels written by L. Dellisse and drawn by Claude Laverdure were published by Belgian publisher Claude Lefrancq: L'Affaire Beltham (1990), Juve contre Fant√¥mas (1991), and Le Mort qui Tue (1995). =Mexican= During the 1960s the Mexican comics publisher Editorial Novaro produced a Fantomas, La Amenaza Elegante (Fantomas, the Elegant Menace) comic book series that became popular throughout Latin America. This was apparently meant to be the same character, although rewritten as a hero, and with no acknowledgement to the original French books or films. Perhaps as a way to make the original French character more attuned to Latin American audiences who crave justice avengers in fiction and national politics. It is not known if this was done with or without legal permission. This Fant√¥mas was a thief who committed spectacular robberies just for the thrill of it, and wore a white skintight mask all the time or a variety of disguises so his true face was never shown to his nemeses. The character was also pursued by the authorities, in his case mainly by a French police inspector named Gerard. His mask in the Latin American version ‚Äì which was clearly inspired by the black mask worn by the Italian comic book criminal Diabolik ‚Äî and his use of it, seems to have been influenced by the popular images generated by Mexican wrestling. Apparently the series was also influenced by the James Bond movies, as Fant√¥mas, equipped with advanced technology created by a scientist called Professor Semo, had all kind of adventures around the world, and even fought other, more cruel criminals. The Latin American Fant√¥mas, created in Mexico, encompassed the aesthetic of both the British James Bond and American Hugh Hefner, who created Playboy magazine, with a necessary dose of traditional Latin American machismo. A mixture that immediately gained traction with vast Latino audiences, mostly prepubescent and adolescents males. Latino Fant√¥mas also was a millionaire, owning several corporations under assumed identities, had secret headquarters outside Paris, and was assisted by several secret agents, including the 12 \\"Zodiac Girls\\", beautiful women who assisted him personally and dressed provocatively, known only by their codenames ‚Äì the signs of the zodiac. The attractive female element was another concession to Latin American audiences familiar with beautiful women as part of male-dominated environments playing key roles without hiding their femininity and preceding Charlie's Angels by decades. Although cancelled years ago (Novaro folded in 1985, and a character revival by rival Grupo Editorial Vid in Mexico in the 1990s did not last long), it is from this Mexican comic that the character is best known in both Central America and South America. Fant√¥mas continues to be one of Latin America's favorite comic characters. For more information on this version of the character check the link to the Fantomas Lives website below. =American= A Fant√¥mas short story by Paul Kupperberg and Roy Mann appeared in Captain Action Comics No. 1, published in 2009 by Moonstone Books. New Fiction \\"Yes Virginia, There is a Fantomas\\" by William Patrick Maynard was published in Tales of the Shadowmen Volume 6, published in 2009 by Black Coat Press. Fantomas has appeared in several stories in the series. The first third of the novella, \\"Reign of Terror\\" by R. Allen Leider was published in Awesome Tales No. 3, published in 2016 by Bold Venture Press. The second third of the novella was published in Awesome Tales No. 9, with the final third coming. Cultural influence The Fant√¥mas novels and the subsequent films were highly regarded by the French avant-garde of the day, particularly by the surrealists. Blaise Cendrars called the series \\"the modern Aeneid\\"; Guillaume Apollinaire said that \\"from the imaginative standpoint Fant√¥mas is one of the richest works that exist.\\" The painter Ren√© Magritte, the surrealist poet and novelist Robert Desnos and the cubist painter Juan Gris produced works alluding to Fant√¥mas. The films were also popular in the Soviet Union. After their success Fant√¥mas had a short appearance in two popular Soviet comedies: Seven Old Men and One Girl (1968) and Grandads-Robbers (1972). In 2007, Russian author Andrey Shary published the book Sign F: Fantomas in Books and on the Screen, dealing in particular with this phenomenon. Pastiches, homages, and related characters * Fant√¥mas may well have been influenced by its less well remembered predecessor, Zigomar, the creation of L√©on Sazie, which first appeared as a serial in Le Matin in 1909, then as a pulp magazine (28 issues) in 1913, and again in Zigomar contre Zigomar for eight more issues in 1924. * In France alone, Fant√¥mas spawned numerous imitators. Among those are Arnould Galopin's Tenebras, Gaston Ren√©'s Masque Rouge, Arthur Bern√®de's Belph√©gor, R. Collard's Demonax and Marcel Allain's own Tigris, Fatala, Miss Teria and Ferocias. * The 1915 adventure film Filibus was probably inspired largely by the popularity of Fant√¥mas, although the film's title character, a female air pirate, strongly resembles Ars√®ne Lupin. * After the success of the first Fant√¥mas film serial directed by Louis Feuillade, Gaumont produced another serial directed by Feuillade in the same style, Les Vampires, about a gang of criminals. As Feuillade had been criticized for glorifying outlaws, his next serial for Gaumont, Judex, starred this time a positive hero, a mysterious avenger conceived as an honest version of Fant√¥mas. Judex was himself featured in various adaptations, sequels and remakes. The original Judex serial was released in the United States and appears to have been an inspiration for the American pulp character The Shadow, who was himself an inspiration for Batman.Xavier Fournier, Super-h√©ros : une histoire fran√ßaise, Huginn Muninn, 2014, p. 69-73 * Fant√¥mas has appeared in an unauthorized fashion in two French stage plays: Nick Carter vs. Fant√¥mas (1910) by Alexandre Bisson and Guillaume Livet (translated, ) and Sherlock Holmes vs. Fant√¥mas (La Mort d' Herlock Sholmes, ou Bandits en Habits Noirs, 1914) by Pierre de Wattyne and Yorril Walter (translated, ). * A number of Italian dark villains of the 1960s were clearly influenced by Fant√¥mas. Among the most famous are Diabolik, Kriminal, Killing, and Satanik. * The British film critic and writer Kim Newman has argued that Fant√¥mas inspired the Pink Panther film series starring Peter Sellers. In the initial 1963 Pink Panther film, Fant√¥mas was transformed into Sir Charles Lytton (the Phantom), and Inspector Juve became Inspector Clouseau. * Fant√¥mas also has many plot points in common with the 1969 Hong Kong movie Temptress of a Thousand Faces. * Paperinik, (Duck Avenger) alter-ego of Donald Duck created by Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi in 1969, is partly based on Fant√¥mas. His predecessor, Fantomius, (Fantomallard) was obviously also named after Fant√¥mas. In France, the character is known as Fantomiald; in Germany as Phantomias; in Greek as Phantom Duck and in Spain as Patomas. * Fant√¥mas inspired Julio Cort√°zar's 1975 novella Fantomas contra los vampiros multinacionales. * Fant√¥mas' grandson, Fantoma Mark III, serves as an antagonist for Ars√®ne Lupin III (grandson of Ars√®ne Lupin) in two episodes of the Red Jacket installment of the Lupin III franchise, wherein his appearance and portrayal are comparable to Jean Marais' version of the character. * A character in the Doctor Who novel The Man in the Velvet Mask (1996) is named Fant√¥mas. * Fantomas was the inspiration for the character Mr. Ixnay, who appears in The Chuckling Whatsit, a 1997 graphic novel by writer/artist Richard Sala, creator of Invisible Hands, an animated homage to old-fashioned mystery thrillers which aired on MTV. * In 1999, former Faith No More singer Mike Patton named his metal group Fant√¥mas after the fictional character. * There is a Marvel Comics character named Fantomex, first appearing in August 2002. He was created by Grant Morrison and Igor Kordey for the title New X-Men. * In one of the back-story sections of the graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II, Fant√¥mas is described as being a member of \\"Les Hommes Myst√©rieux\\", the French counterpart of the League, alongside Ars√®ne Lupin, the sky-pirate Robur, and the Nyctalope. In the follow-up, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier, the League's encounter with Les Hommes is halted once Fant√¥mas detonates a bomb which destroys the Opera Garnier, after saying in unaccented English, \\"I win\\". * The character of Spectrobert in Gahan Wilson's book Everybody's Favorite Duck is a direct parody of Fant√¥mas. * Fant√¥mas is a partial inspiration for the character of Phantom Limb on the Adult Swim cartoon The Venture Bros. His last name, in fact, is Fant√¥mas. A picture similar in appearance to the masked villain can be seen hanging on the wall of his office at State University in \\"The Invisible Hand of Fate\\". It is revealed that Phantom Limb is actually the grandson of the famous criminal. Fant√¥mas himself briefly appears in the series during a flashback in the season 3 episode \\"ORB\\" as one of the original members of the Guild of Calamitous Intent. * Fant√¥mas has a German cousin in the person of the (supposedly British) Lord Lister. * In the story \\"Fant√¥mville\\" by Nick Campbell, in the book Wildthyme in Purple, Fantomas meets the time traveller Iris Wildthyme. * In the film adaptation of Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the Fantom (a character resembling the title character from The Phantom of the Opera) owes more than a little to Fant√¥mas, although he is ultimately revealed to be M, who in turn is revealed to be Professor Moriarty. *In the Egyptian movie, ‚ÄúRomantic Chase‚Äù, produced in 1968, Fant√¥mas is played by Egyptian actor Hasan Mustafa. The role of Fant√¥mas is a butler that wants to steal all the money of his employer. The film itself is an adaptation of What's New Pussycat? which was produced in 1965. *In the Czech Fantasy TV series Arabela and the sequel Arabela Returns (Arabela se vrac√≠), the French movie version of Fantomas is one of the residents in the World of Fairy Tales.

What remains is about in extent and the bulk of the site is a public garden upkept by the City of London Corporation. It was first in devoted use as a burial ground from 1665 until 1854, in which period approximately 123,000 interments were estimated to have taken place. Over 2,000 monuments remain, for the most part in concentrated blocks. It was a prototype of land-use protected, nondenominational grounds, and was particularly favoured by nonconformists who passed their final years in the region. It contains the graves of many notable people, including John Bunyan (died 1688), author of The Pilgrim's Progress; Daniel Defoe (died 1731), author of Robinson Crusoe; William Blake (died 1827), artist, poet, and mystic; Susanna Wesley (died 1742), known as the \\"Mother of Methodism\\" through her education of sons John and Charles; Thomas Bayes (died 1761), statistician and philosopher; and Isaac Watts (died 1748), the \\"Father of English Hymnody\\". A hyperlapse video showing the paths around the cemetery Bunhill Fields Burial Ground is listed Grade I on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Nearby, on the west side of Bunhill Row and behind the residential tower Braithwaite House, is a former Quaker burial ground, in use from 1661 to 1855, at times also known as Bunhill Fields. George Fox (d. 1691), one of the founders of the movement, is among those buried there. Its remains are also a public garden, Quaker Gardens, managed by the London Borough of Islington. Historical background Plan of the present Bunhill Fields public gardens (east at the top). Areas in green are fenced, and contain most of the surviving monuments. Areas in yellow and white have been largely cleared of monuments, and are fully accessible to the public. Bunhill Fields was part of the Manor of Finsbury (originally Fensbury), which has its origins as the prebend of Halliwell and Finsbury, belonging to St Paul's Cathedral and established in 1104. In 1315 the prebendary manor was granted by Archdeacon Robert Baldock to the Mayor and commonalty of London. This enabled more general public access to the semi-fen or moor stretching from the City of London's boundary (London Wall), to the village of Hoxton. In 1498 part of the otherwise unenclosed landscape was set aside to form a large field for military exercises of archers and others. This part of the manor has sports and occasional military use: Artillery Ground. Next to this lies Bunhill Fields. The name derives from \\"Bone hill\\", likely linked to occasional burials from at least Saxon times, but more probably derives from the use for mass- deposit for human bones ‚Äî amounting to over 1,000 cartloads ‚Äî brought from St Paul's charnel house in 1549 (when that building was demolished).Holmes 1896, pp. 133‚Äì34. The dried bones were deposited on the moor and capped with a thin layer of soil. This built up a hill across the otherwise damp, flat fens, such that three windmills could safely be erected in a spot that came to be one of the many windmill hills. Opening as a burial ground Dame Mary Page (died 1729). The inscription reads in part: \\"In 67 months she was tap'd [tapped] 66 times, Had taken away 240 gallons of water without ever repining at her case or ever fearing the operation.\\" Monument to Theophilus Gale, South Enclosure. In keeping with this tradition, in 1665 the City of London Corporation decided to use some of the land as a common burial ground for the interment of bodies of inhabitants who had died of the plague and could not be accommodated in the churchyards. Outer walls were completed but Church of England officials never consecrated the ground nor used it for burials. A Mr. Tindal took over the lease. He allowed extramural graveyard burials in what was unconsecrated soil, thus popular with nonconformists ‚Äî those Protestant Christians who practised their faiths outside the Church of England; unlike Anglican, Jewish and Catholic grounds it was open for interment to anyone who could afford the fees. It appears on Rocque's Map of London of 1746, and elsewhere, as \\"Tindal's Burying Ground\\". An inscription at the eastern entrance gate to the burial ground reads: \\"This church-yard was inclosed with a brick wall at the sole charges of the City of London, in the mayoralty of Sir John Lawrence, , Anno Domini 1665; and afterwards the gates thereof were built and finished in the mayoralty of Sir Thomas Bloudworth, Knt., Anno Domini, 1666.\\" The present gates and inscription date from 1868, but the wording follows that of an original 17th-century inscription at the western entrance, now lost. The earliest recorded monumental inscription was that to \\"Grace, daughter of T. Cloudesly, of Leeds. February 1666\\".William Maitland, The History and Survey of London from its Foundation to the Present Time (London, 1756), p. 775 The earliest surviving monument is believed to be the headstone to Theophilus Gale: the inscription reads \\"Theophilus Gale MA / Born 1628 / Died 1678\\". In 1769 an Act of Parliament gave the Corporation the right to continue the lease for 99 years. The City authorities continued to let the ground to their tenant as a burial ground; in 1781 the Corporation decided to take over management of the burial ground. So many historically important Protestant nonconformists chose this as their place of interment that the 19th-century poet and writer Robert Southey characterised Bunhill Fields in 1830 as the ground \\"which the Dissenters regard as their Campo Santo\\". This term was applied to its \\"daughter\\", Abney Park Cemetery in Stoke Newington. Monuments in Bunhill Fields Closure as a burial ground Act of 1867 for the Preservation of Bunhill fields as an Open Space In 1852 the Burial Act was passed which enabled grounds to be closed once they became full. An Order for Closure for Bunhill Fields was made in December 1853, and the final burial (that of Elizabeth Howell Oliver) took place on 5 January 1854. Occasional interments continued to be permitted in existing vaults or graves: the final burial of this kind is believed to have been that of a Mrs. Gabriel of Brixton in February 1860.Corporation of London 1991, p. 8. By this date approximately 123,000 interments had taken place in the burial ground.Corporation of London 1991, pp. 4, 8. Two decades before, a group of City nonconformists led by George Collison bought a site for a new landscaped alternative, at part of Abney Park in Stoke Newington. This was named Abney Park Cemetery and opened in 1840. All parts were available for the burial of any person, regardless of religious creed. It preceded Brookwood Cemetery as the prototype of many cemeteries to come nationally with \\"no invidious dividing lines\\". It has a unique nondenominational chapel, designed by William Hosking. Community garden Upon closure of the Bunhill Fields Burial Ground, its future was uncertain as its lessee, the City of London Corporation, was close to expiry of its lease, scheduled for Christmas 1867.Ledger-Lomas 2017. To prevent the land from being redeveloped by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners (who controlled the freehold) at this expiry, the Corporation formed the Special Bunhill Fields Burial Ground Committee in 1865. This became formally known as the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee. Appointed by the Corporation, it consisted on twelve advisors under the chairmanship of Charles Reed, FSA (son of the Congregational philanthropist Andrew Reed). He later rose to prominence as the first MP for Hackney and Chairman of the first School Board for London before being knighted. Along with his interest in making it into a parkland landscape, he was similarly interested in the wider educational and public benefits of Abney Park Cemetery, of which he was a prominent director. To corroborate the committee's work, the Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament, the Bunhill Fields Burial Ground Act 1867, \\"for the Preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground ... as an open space\\". The legislation enabled them to continue to maintain the site when possession would have otherwise reverted to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, provided it was laid out as a public open space with seating, gardens, and some of its most worthy monuments were restored. The improvements, which included the laying out of walks and paths, cost an estimated ¬£3,500. The new park was opened by the Lord Mayor, James Clarke Lawrence, on 14 October 1869. The ground was severely damaged by German bombing during World War II; it is believed to have hosted an anti- aircraft gun during the Blitz. In the 1950s, after some debate, the City ordered: to clear the northern third (the projection) of the site of most of its monuments to open it as a public garden; and to preserve and protect the rest behind railings. Legislation in 1960 gave the freehold to the City (the Corporation), which continues to maintain the grounds. Landscaping was designed and overseen by the architect and landscape architect Peter Shepheard in 1964‚Äì65.Corporation of London 1991, pp. 9‚Äì10. In February 2012, Occupy London opened an encampment in the NW corner to replace their Bank of Ideas at Sun Street. Bunyan, Defoe and Blake The broadwalk, looking north. John Bunyan's monument is in the foreground, with memorials to Daniel Defoe (obelisk, left) and Willam Blake (headstone, right) in the background. The best-known monuments are those to the three literary and artistic figures, John Bunyan, Daniel Defoe and William Blake. Their graves have long been sites of cultural pilgrimage: Isabella Holmes stated in 1896 that the \\"most frequented paths\\" in the burial ground were those leading to the monuments of Bunyan and Defoe.Holmes 1896, p. 135. In their present form, all these monuments post-date the closure of the burial ground. Their settings were further radically modified by the landscaping of 1964‚Äì65, when a paved north‚Äìsouth \\"broadwalk\\" was created in the middle of the burial ground to display them ‚Äì outside the railed-off areas, accessible to visitors, and cleared of other monuments. Bunyan's monument lies at the broadwalk's southern end, and that to Defoe at its northern end, while Blake's headstone was moved from the site of his grave and repositioned next to Defoe, alongside the headstone to the lesser-known Joseph Swain (d. 1796). This arrangement survives, but in 2018 a second monument to Blake was placed on the actual site of his grave. =John Bunyan= John Bunyan, author of Pilgrim's Progress, died in August 1688. He was initially buried in the \\"Baptist Corner\\" at the back of the burial ground, on the understanding that his remains would be moved into the family vault of his friend John Strudwick when that was next opened for a burial. There is no certain evidence as to when (or even if) this was done: the probability, however, is that it occurred when Strudwick himself died in 1695, and certainly Bunyan's name was inscribed on the side of the monument. The Strudwick monument took the form of a large Baroque stone chest. By the 19th century, this had fallen into decay, but in the period following the closure of the burial ground a public appeal for its restoration was launched under the presidency of the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury. This work was completed in May 1862, and comprised a complete reconstruction of the monument, undertaken by the sculptor Edgar George Papworth Senior (1809‚Äì66). Although Papworth retained the basic form of the tomb-chest, he added a recumbent effigy of Bunyan to the top of it, and two relief panels to its sides depicting scenes from Pilgrim's Progress. The monument was further restored in 1928 (the tercentenary of Bunyan's birth), and again after World War II (following serious wartime damage to the effigy's face).

His daughter-in-law was also buried in the same grave. Defoe died in poverty, and the grave was marked with a simple headstone. In the winter of 1857/8 ‚Äì at a time when the burial ground was closed and neglected ‚Äì the grave was struck by lightning and the headstone broken. In 1869, James Clarke, editor of the Christian World children's newspaper, launched an appeal for subscriptions to place a more suitable memorial on the grave. He encouraged his readers to make donations of sixpence each; and to stimulate enthusiasm opened two lists, one for boys and one for girls, to encourage a spirit of competition between them. Many adults also made donations. In the end, some 1,700 subscriptions raised a total of about ¬£200. A design for a marble obelisk (or \\"Cleopatric pillar\\") was commissioned from C. C. Creeke; and the sculptor Samuel Horner of Bournemouth was commissioned to execute it. In late 1869, when the foundations were being dug, skeletons were disinterred, and there was an unseemly rush for souvenirs by the crowd of onlookers: the police had to be called before calm was restored. The monument was unveiled at a ceremony attended by three of Defoe's great-granddaughters on 16 September 1870. =William Blake= William Blake ‚Äì painter, poet, printmaker and visionary ‚Äì died in August 1827 and was buried in the northern part of the burial ground. His wife, Catherine Sophia, died in October 1831 and was buried in a separate grave on the south side of the ground. By the 20th century, Blake's grave was in disrepair; and in 1927, for the centenary of his death and at a time when his reputation was on the rise, a new headstone was commissioned. As it had been decided to commemorate both William and Catherine, despite the fact that the headstone would stand at some distance from Catherine's grave, the inscription was phrased as \\"Near by lie the remains of ...\\". When Bunhill Fields was relandscaped in the 1960s, Blake's grave lay in the area that was to be cleared of monuments. The headstone was therefore moved approximately 20 metres to its present location, next to the monument to Daniel Defoe. It was also rotated through 90¬∞, so that it now faces south rather than west. Joseph Swain's headstone was added to the grouping at the same time, although that faces west. Flowers, coins and other tokens are regularly left by visitors to Blake's headstone. In 2006‚Äì07, members of the group The Friends of William Blake established the original location of his grave, and proposed placing a new memorial there. In the form of a ledger stone, with lettering by Lida Cardozo Kindersley, this was finally unveiled on 12 August 2018 by Philip Pullman, President of the Blake Society.

Note that this is a runner stone; a bedstone would not have the \\"Spanish Cross\\" into which the supporting millrind fits. Millstones or mill stones are stones used in gristmills, for grinding wheat or other grains. Millstones come in pairs. The base or bedstone is stationary. Above the bedstone is the turning runner stone which actually does the grinding. The runner stone spins above the stationary bedstone creating the \\"scissoring\\" or grinding action of the stones. A runner stone is generally slightly concave, while the bedstone is slightly convex. This helps to channel the ground flour to the outer edges of the stones where it can be gathered up. The runner stone is supported by a cross-shaped metal piece (rind or rynd) fixed to a \\"mace head\\" topping the main shaft or spindle leading to the driving mechanism of the mill (wind, water (including tide) or other means).  History  Millstone factory site in Britain Neolithic and Upper Paleolithic people used millstones to grind grains, nuts, rhizomes and other vegetable food products for consumption. These implements are often called grinding stones. They used either saddle stones or rotary querns turned by hand. Such devices were also used to grind pigments and metal ores prior to smelting. In India, grinding stones (Chakki) were used to grind grains and spices. These consist of a stationary stone cylinder upon which a smaller stone cylinder rotates. Smaller ones, for household use, were operated by two people. Larger ones, for community or commercial use, used livestock to rotate the upper cylinder.  Material  Buhr stone with resurfacing instructions The type of stone most suitable for making millstones is a siliceous rock called burrstone (or buhrstone), an open-textured, porous but tough, fine- grained sandstone, or a silicified, fossiliferous limestone. In some sandstones, the cement is calcareous. Millstones used in Britain were of several types: * Derbyshire Peak stones of grey Millstone Grit, cut from one piece, used for grinding barley; imitation Derbyshire Peak stones are used as decorative signposts at the boundaries of the Peak District National Park. Derbyshire Peak stones wear quickly and are typically used to grind animal feed since they leave stone powder in the flour, making it undesirable for human consumption. * French buhrstones, used for finer grinding. French Burr comes from the Marne Valley in northern France. The millstones are not cut from one piece, but built up from sections of quartz cemented together, backed with plaster and bound with shrink-fit iron bands. Slots in the bands provide attachments for lifting. In southern England the material was imported as pieces of rock, only assembled into complete millstones in local workshops. It was necessary to balance the completed runner stone with lead weights applied to the lighter side. *Composite stones, built up from pieces of emery, were introduced during the nineteenth century; they were found to be more suitable for grinding at the higher speeds available when auxiliary engines were adopted. In Europe, a further type of millstone was used. These were uncommon in Britain, but not unknown: * Cullen stones, (stones from Cologne), a form of black lava quarried in the Rhine Valley at Mayen near Cologne, Germany. Patterning Dressing a millstone The surface of a millstone is divided by deep grooves called furrows into separate flat areas called lands. Spreading away from the furrows are smaller grooves called feathering or cracking. The grooves provide a cutting edge and help to channel the ground flour out from the stones. The furrows and lands are arranged in repeating patterns called harps. A typical millstone will have six, eight or ten harps. The pattern of harps is repeated on the face of each stone, when they are laid face to face the patterns mesh in a kind of \\"scissoring\\" motion creating the cutting or grinding function of the stones. When in regular use stones need to be dressed periodically, that is, re-cut to keep the cutting surfaces sharp. Millstones need to be evenly balanced, and achieving the correct separation of the stones is crucial to producing good quality flour. The experienced miller will be able to adjust their separation very accurately.  Grinding with millstones  A pair of millstones in Holgate Windmill thumbleft 1\\\\. Hopper 2\\\\. Shoe 3\\\\.

Casing (Tentering gear not shown) Grain is fed by gravity from the hopper into the feed-shoe. The shoe is agitated by a shoe handle running against an agitator (damsel) on the stone spindle, the shaft powering the runner stone. This mechanism regulates the feed of grain to the millstones by making the feed dependent on the speed of the runner stone. From the feed shoe the grain falls through the eye, the central hole, of the runner stone and is taken between the runner and the bed stone to be ground. The flour exits from between the stones from the side. The stone casing prevents the flour from falling on the floor, instead it is taken to the meal spout from where it can be bagged or processed further. Gilingan bato (ancient rice millstone, Minalin, Pampanga, Philippines) The runner stone is supported by the rind, a cross- shaped metal piece, on the spindle. The spindle is carried by the tentering gear, a set of beams forming a lever system, or a screw jack, with which the runner stone can be lifted or lowered slightly and the gap between the stones adjusted.Wood (2003) p 19 The weight of the runner stone is significant (up to ) and it is this weight combined with the cutting action from the porous stone and the patterning that causes the milling process. Millstones for some water-powered mills (such as Peirce Mill) spin at about 125 rpm.NPS publication \\"Peirce Mill\\" GPO: 2004--304-337/00145 Reprint 2004 Especially in the case of wind-powered mills the turning speed can be irregular. Higher speed means more grain is fed to the stones by the feed- shoe, and grain exits the stones more quickly because of their faster turning speed. The miller has to reduce the gap between the stones so more weight of the runner presses down on the grain and the grinding action is increased to prevent the grain being ground too coarsely. It has the added benefit of increasing the load on the mill and so slowing it down. In the reverse case the miller may have to raise the runner stone if the grain is milled too thoroughly making it unsuitable for baking. In any case the stones should never touch during milling as this would cause them to wear down rapidly. The process of lowering and raising the runner stone is called tentering and lightering. In many windmills it is automated by adding a centrifugal governor to the tentering gear. Depending on the type of grain to be milled and the power available the miller may adjust the feed of grain to stones beforehand by changing the amount of agitation of the feed-shoe or adjusting the size of the hopper outlet. Milling by millstones is a one-step process in contrast with roller mills in modern mass production where milling takes place in many steps. It produces wholemeal flour which can be turned into white flour by sifting to remove the bran.

He was a successful pop singer in the United States during the 1950s and early 1960s. He sold more than 45 million records, had 38 Top 40 hits, and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood films. According to Billboard, Boone was the second-biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only Elvis Presley, and was ranked at No. 9 in its listing of the Top 100 Top 40 Artists 1955‚Äì1995. Until the 2010s, Boone held the Billboard record for spending 220 consecutive weeks on the charts with one or more songs each week. At the age of 23, he began hosting a half-hour ABC variety television series, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, which aired for 115 episodes (1957‚Äì1960). Many musical performers, including Edie Adams, Andy Williams, Pearl Bailey, and Johnny Mathis, made appearances on the show. His cover versions of rhythm and blues hits had a noticeable effect on the development of the broad popularity of rock and roll. Elvis Presley was the opening act for a 1955 Pat Boone show in Cleveland, Ohio. As an author, Boone had a number-one bestseller in the 1950s (Twixt Twelve and Twenty, Prentice-Hall). In the 1960s, he focused on gospel music and is a member of the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. He continues to perform and speak as a motivational speaker, a television personality, and a conservative political commentator. Life and career=Early life= Boone was born on June 1, 1934, in Jacksonville, Florida, the son of Margaret Virginia (n√©e Pritchard) and Archie Altman Boone. He was raised in Nashville, Tennessee, where his family moved when he was two years old. Boone attended and graduated in 1952 from David Lipscomb High School in Nashville. His younger brother, whose professional name is Nick Todd, was also a pop singer in the 1950s and is now a church music leader. Boone's handprints and shoe prints in front of The Great Movie Ride at Disney World's Disney's Hollywood Studios In a 2007 interview on The 700 Club, Boone claimed that he is the great-great-great-great grandson of the American pioneer Daniel Boone. In November 1953, when he was 19 years old, Boone married Chicago-born Tennesseean Shirley Lee Foley (April 24, 1934 ‚Äì January 11, 2019), also 19 years old, daughter of country music great Red Foley and his wife, singer Judy Martin. They had four daughters: Cheryl \\"Cherry\\" Lynn, Linda \\"Lindy\\" Lee, Deborah \\"Debby\\" Ann, and Laura \\"Laury\\" Gene. Starting in the late 1950s, Boone and his family were residents of Leonia, New Jersey.Staff. \\"Kings for A Day\\", Boston Globe, June 16, 1958. Retrieved March 30, 2011. \\"Singer Pat Boone and family leave Leonia, NJ home for church. Front, Cherry, 3 1/2; Debbie, 1 1/2, and Linda, 2 1/2.\\" Shirley Boone was a lesser known recording artist and television personality than her husband. She also founded a hunger-relief Christian ministry, Mercy Corps. She died in 2019, aged 84, at the couple's Beverly Hills home from complications from vasculitis, which she had contracted less than a year earlier. He primarily attended David Lipscomb College, and later Lipscomb University in Nashville. He graduated in 1958 from Columbia University School of General Studies magna cum laudeGerstenzang, Peter. \\"Pat 'n Leather\\", Columbia, Winter 2007‚Äì2008. having previously attended North Texas State University, now known as the University of North Texas, in Denton, Texas. =Career= Boone began his career by performing in Nashville's Centennial Park. He began recording in 1954 for Republic Records (not to be confused with the current label with that name), and by 1955, for Dot Records. His 1955 version of Fats Domino's \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" was a hit. This set the stage for the early part of Boone's career, which focused on covering R&B; songs by black artists for a white American market.Karen Schoemer \\"More Mr. Nice Guy\\", American Heritage, Feb/March 2006. Randy Wood, the owner of Dot, had issued an R&B; single by the Griffin Brothers in 1951 called \\"Tra La La-a\\"‚Äîa different song from the later LaVern Baker one‚Äîand he was keen to put out another version after the original had failed. This became the B-side of the first Boone single \\"Two Hearts Two Kisses\\", originally by the Charms ‚Äì whose \\"Hearts Of Stone\\" had been covered by the label's Fontane Sisters. A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song \\"I Almost Lost My Mind\\", by Ivory Joe Hunter, which was originally covered by another black star, Nat King Cole. According to an opinion poll of high-school students in 1957, the singer was nearly the \\"two-to-one favorite over Elvis Presley among boys and preferred almost three- to-one by girls ...\\"See the statistics in Ennis, Philip H., The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rocknroll in American Popular Music (Wesleyan University Press, 1992), pp. 251‚Äì52 During the late 1950s, he made regular appearances on ABC-TV's Ozark Jubilee, hosted by his father-in-law. He cultivated a safe, wholesome, advertiser-friendly image that won him a long- term product endorsement contract from General Motors during the late 1950s, lasting through the 1960s. He succeeded Dinah Shore singing the praises of the GM product: \\"See the USA in your Chevrolet ... drive your Chevrolet through the USA, America's the greatest land of all!\\" GM had also sponsored The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom. In the 1989 documentary Roger & Me, Boone stated that he first was given a Chevrolet Corvette from the GM product line, but after his wife and he started having children, at one child a year over five years, GM supplied him with a station wagon, as well. Many of Boone's hit singles were covers of hits from black Rock and Roll artists. These included: \\"Ain't That a Shame\\" by Fats Domino; \\"Tutti Frutti\\" and \\"Long Tall Sally\\" by Little Richard; \\"At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)\\" by The El Dorados; and the blues ballads \\"I Almost Lost My Mind\\" by Ivory Joe Hunter, \\"I'll be Home\\" by the Flamingos and \\"Don't Forbid Me\\" by Charles Singleton. Boone also wrote the lyrics for the instrumental theme song for the movie Exodus, which he titled \\"This Land Is Mine\\". (Ernest Gold had composed the music.) As a conservative Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles that he felt might compromise his beliefs‚Äîincluding a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In one of his first films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to make sure it was all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions. He appeared as a regular performer on Arthur Godfrey and His Friends from 1955 through 1957, and later hosted his own The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, on Thursday evenings. In 1959, Boone's likeness was licensed to DC Comics, first appearing in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane No. 9 (May 1959) before starring in his own series from the publisher which lasted for five issues from September 1959 to May 1960. In the early 1960s, he began writing a series of self-help books for adolescents, including Twixt Twelve and Twenty. The British Invasion ended Boone's career as a hitmaker, though he continued recording throughout the 1960s. In the 1970s, he switched to gospel and country, and he continued performing in other media, as well. In the 1960s and 1970s. the Boone family toured as gospel singers and made gospel albums, such as The Pat Boone Family and The Family Who Prays. Pat and Debby Boone singing for a fan, 1997 In the early 1970s, Boone founded the record label Lamb & Lion Records. It featured artists such as Pat, the Pat Boone Family, Debby Boone, Dan Peek, DeGarmo and Key, and Dogwood. In 1974, Boone was signed to the Motown country subsidiary Melodyland. The label was later to be renamed Hitsville after a Christian church sued Motown's president Berry Gordy over the use of the earlier name. The country subsidiary was closed in 1977. In 1978, Boone became the first target in the Federal Trade Commission's crackdown on false-claim product endorsements by celebrities. He had appeared with his daughter Debby in a commercial to claim that all four of his daughters had found a preparation named Acne-Statin a \\"real help\\" in keeping their skin clear. The FTC filed a complaint against the manufacturer, contending that the product did not really keep skin free of blemishes. Boone eventually signed a consent order in which he promised not only to stop appearing in the ads, but also to pay about 2.5% of any money that the FTC or the courts might eventually order the manufacturer to refund to consumers. Boone said, through a lawyer, that his daughters actually did use Acne-Statin, and that he was \\"dismayed to learn that the product's efficacy had not been scientifically established as he believed.\\" On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Pat Boone among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. =Film career= Pat Boone, circa 1960 In 1956 Boone was one of the biggest recording stars in the US. Several film studios pursued him for movies; he decided to go with 20th Century Fox, which had made Elvis Presley's first movie. Fox reworked a play he had bought, Bernadine, into a vehicle for Boone. The resulting film was a solid hit, earning $3.75 million in the US. Even more popular was April Love (1957), a remake of Home in Indiana. Boone regards it as one of his favourites, \\"the kind of movie I wish I could have made 20 more of: a musical, appealing characters, some drama, a good storyline, a happy ending, it's the kind of film which makes you feel good. I never wanted to make a depressing or immoral film.\\" Less popular was a musical comedy Mardi Gras (1958), which was the last movie of Edmund Goulding. However, Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959), a science fiction adventure tale, was a huge hit. Boone had been reluctant to do it, and needed to be persuaded by being offered the chance to sing several songs and given a percentage of the profits, but was glad he did. He produced and starred in a documentary, Salute to the Teenagers (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with Sanford Meisner. He returned with a military comedy, All Hands on Deck (1961), a mild hit. He was one of several names in another remake, State Fair (1962), a box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood, so Boone decided to take on a dramatic role in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-distributed movie The Main Attraction (1962) for Seven Arts Productions, his first movie outside Fox. It was an unhappy experience for Boone as he disliked the implication his character had sex with Nancy Kwan's and he got into several public fights with the producers. He had a deal with Fox to make three films at $200,000 a film with his production company. This was meant to start with a thriller, The Yellow Canary (1963), in which Boone would play an unsympathetic character. New management came in at the studio which was unenthusiastic about the picture but because Boone had a pay or play deal, they decided to make it anyway, only with a much shorter budget. Boone even paid some money out of his own pocket to help complete it.Mark Thomas McGee, Talk's Cheap, Action's Expensive: The Films of Robert L. Lippert, Bear Manor Media, 2014, pp. 271‚Äì72 Boone's next movie for Fox was another low-budget effort, The Horror of It All (1963), shot in England. He shot a comedy in Ireland, Never Put It in Writing (1964) for Allied Artists. Boone's third film for Fox was an \\"A\\" production, Goodbye Charlie (1964), but Boone was in support of Debbie Reynolds and Tony Curtis. He was one of the many names in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965). He appeared in The Perils of Pauline (1967), a pilot for a TV series that did not eventuate, which was screened in some theatres. Boone's last film of note was The Cross and the Switchblade (1970). =Later work= In 1997, Boone released In a Metal Mood: No More Mr. Nice Guy, a collection of heavy metal covers. To promote the album, he appeared at the American Music Awards in black leather. He was then dismissed from Gospel America, a TV show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. After making a special appearance on TBN with the president of the network, Paul Crouch, and his pastor, Jack Hayford, many fans accepted his explanation of the leather outfit being a \\"parody of himself\\". Trinity Broadcasting then reinstated him, and Gospel America was brought back. In 2003, the Nashville Gospel Music Association recognized his gospel recording work by inducting him into its Gospel Music Hall of Fame. In September 2006, Boone released We Are Family: R&B; Classics, featuring cover versions of 11 R&B; hits, including the title track, plus \\"Papa's Got A Brand New Bag\\", \\"Soul Man\\", \\"Get Down Tonight\\", \\"A Woman Needs Love\\", and six other classics. In 2010, plans were announced for the Pat Boone Family Theater at Broadway at the Beach in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. The attraction was never built. In 2011, Boone acted as a spokesperson for Security One Lending, a reverse mortgage company. Since at least 2007 Boone has acted as a spokesperson for Swiss America Trading Corporation, a broker of gold and silver coins that warns of \\"America's Economic Collapse\\". =Religious background= Boone grew up in the Church of Christ. In the 1960s, Boone's marriage nearly came to an end because of his use of alcohol and his preference for attending parties. However, after coming into contact with the Charismatic Movement, Shirley began to focus more on her religion and eventually influenced Pat and their daughters toward a similar religious focus. At this time, they attended the Inglewood Church of Christ. In the spring of 1964, Boone spoke at a \\"Project Prayer\\" rally attended by 2,500 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by Anthony Eisley, a star of ABC's Hawaiian Eye series, sought to flood the United States Congress with letters in support of mandatory school prayer, following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the United States Supreme Court which struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Joining Boone and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were Walter Brennan, Lloyd Nolan, Rhonda Fleming, Gloria Swanson, and Dale Evans. Boone declared, \\"what the communists want is to subvert and undermine our young people. ... I believe in the power of aroused Americans, I believe in the wisdom of our Constitution. ... the power of God.\\" It was noted that Roy Rogers, John Wayne, Ronald Reagan, Mary Pickford, Jane Russell, Ginger Rogers, and Pat Buttram had endorsed the goals of the rally and would also have attended had their schedules not been in conflict. In the early 1970s, the Boones hosted Bible studies for celebrities such as Doris Day, Glenn Ford, Zsa Zsa Gabor, and Priscilla Presley at their Beverly Hills home. The family then began attending The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, a Foursquare Gospel megachurch pastored by Jack Hayford. On an April 22, 2016, broadcast of Fox News Radio's The Alan Colmes Show, Boone discussed an episode of Saturday Night Live which included a sketch entitled God Is a Boob Man; the sketch parodied the film God's Not Dead 2, in which Boone had a role.Pat Boone: The FCC Should Punish Blasphemy, on The Alan Colmes Show; published April 22, 2016. Retrieved April 24, 2016 He described the sketch as \\"blasphemy\\", stating that the Federal Communications Commission should forbid any such content, and that it should revoke the broadcast licenses of any \\"network, or whoever is responsible for the shows\\". =Politics= Boone supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election. In the 2007 Kentucky gubernatorial election, Boone campaigned unsuccessfully for incumbent Republican Ernie Fletcher with a recorded automated telephone message stating that the Democratic Party candidate Steve Beshear would support \\"every homosexual cause.\\" As part of the campaign, Boone asked, \\"Now do you want a governor who'd like Kentucky to be another San Francisco?\\" On August 29, 2009, Boone wrote an article comparing liberalism to cancer, likening it to \\"black filthy cells\\". In December 2009, Boone endorsed conservative Republican John Wayne Tucker's campaign in Missouri's 3rd congressional district against incumbent Russ Carnahan (D) in the 2010 midterm elections. Boone promoted conspiracy theories about Barack Obama's citizenship and religion, claiming that Obama was born in Kenya, is fluent in Arabic, and is a Muslim who \\"hasn't celebrated any Christian holidays in the White House.\\"Palash Ghosh, Obama is a Kenya-Born Muslim: Pat Boone, International Business Times (September 17, 2011).Jessica Hopper, Pat Boone's Not Convinced, Still a Birther, ABC News (September 21, 2011). Boone received a lifetime achievement award at the 38th annual Conservative Political Action Conference held in February 2011. In June 2016, Boone, along with Mike Huckabee and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film God's Not Dead 2, sent a letter to California Governor Jerry Brown in opposition to Senate Bill 1146 which \\"prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination\\" at California colleges. Other than schools that train pastors and theology teachers, schools \\"might no longer be allowed to hire Christian-only staff, teach religious ideas in regular classes, require attendance at chapel services, or keep bathrooms and dormitories restricted to either males or females.\\" =Basketball interests= Boone is a basketball fan and had ownership interests in two teams. He owned a team in the Hollywood Studio League called the Cooga Moogas. The Cooga Moogas included Bill Cosby, Rafer Johnson, Gardner McKay, Don Murray, and Denny \\"Tarzan\\" Miller. With the founding of the American Basketball Association, Boone became the majority owner of the league's team in Oakland, California, on February 2, 1967. The team was first named the Oakland Americans, but was later renamed as the Oakland Oaks, the name under which it played from 1967 to 1969. The Oaks won the 1969 ABA championship. Despite the Oaks' success on the court, the team had severe financial problems. By August 1969, the Bank of America was threatening to foreclose on a $1.2 million loan to the Oaks, and the team was sold to a group of businessmen in Washington, D.C., and became the Washington Caps. Boone later played for the Virginia Creepers, an 80‚Äì84 age group Senior Olympic team that narrowly lost to the gold medal-winning team; Boone aged out (by turning 85) on June 1, 2019.

The group consisted of lead singer Veronica Bennett (later known as Ronnie Spector), her older sister Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. They had sung together since they were teenagers, then known as \\"The Darling Sisters\\". Signed first by Colpix Records in 1961, they moved to Phil Spector's Philles Records in March 1963 and changed their name to \\"The Ronettes\\". One of the most popular groups of the 1960s, the Ronettes placed nine songs on the Billboard Hot 100, five of which became Top 40 hits. Among the their most famous songs are \\"Be My Baby\\", \\"Baby, I Love You\\", \\"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up\\" and \\"Walking in the Rain\\". In 1964, the group released their only studio album, Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica. That year, the Rolling Stones were their opening act when they toured the UK. The Ronettes opened for the Beatles on their 1966 US tour, becoming the only girl group to tour with them, before splitting up in 1967. Their song \\"Be My Baby\\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. Rolling Stone ranked their album Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica No. 422 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The Ronettes were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007. The early years (1950‚Äì1961) The Ronettes began as a family act where the girls grew up in Washington Heights, Manhattan. According to Nedra Talley, they started singing during childhood visits to their grandmother's home. \\"Estelle and Veronica are sisters,\\" she said in a later interview. \\"I'm their cousin. Our mothers are sisters. We came out of a family that, on Saturday nights, home for us was at our grandmother's, entertaining each other.\\" The Bennetts' mother was African-American and Cherokee; their father was Irish- American. Their cousin, Talley, is African-American, Cherokee and Puerto Rican. The trio also had a great-grandfather who was Chinese. \\"By the time I was eight, I was already working up whole numbers for our family's little weekend shows,\\" Ronnie Spector later recalled. \\"Then Estelle would get up onstage and do a song, or she'd join Nedra or my cousin Elaine and me in a number we'd worked out in three-part harmony.\\" Furthering their interest in show business, Estelle was enrolled at Startime, a popular dancing school in the 1950s, while Ronnie became fascinated with Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers. In 1957, Ronnie formed the group which would later become known as the Ronettes. Composed of Ronnie, her sister Estelle, and their cousins Nedra, Diane, and Elaine, the five girls learned how to perfect their harmonies first at their grandmother's house, and they became proficient in songs such as ‚ÄúGoodnight Sweetheart‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Red Robin‚Äù. Emulating Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, the girls added their male cousin Ira to the group and signed up for a Wednesday night amateur show at the Apollo Theatre run by a friend of Ronnie and Estelle's mother. The show started out as a disaster; when the house band started playing Frankie Lymon's \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\", Ira did not sing a word, so Ronnie took over. \\"I strutted out across the stage, singing as loud as I could,\\" Ronnie later recalled. \\"When I finally heard a few hands of scattered applause, I sang even louder. That brought a little more applause, which was all I needed.\\" Colpix Records and The Peppermint Lounge (1961‚Äì1963) After their night at the Apollo, Ira, Elaine, and Diane left the group. After the curious renaming of the group to \\"Ronnie and the Relatives\\", Ronnie, Estelle, and Nedra began taking singing lessons two afternoons per week. Appearing at local bar mitzvahs and sock hops, they met Phil Halikus, who introduced them to Colpix Records producer Stu Phillips. According to Ronnie, Phillips played the piano while the women auditioned for him, singing \\"What's So Sweet About Sweet Sixteen\\". The audition was successful, and the group was brought into the studio in June 1961 and recorded four tracks: \\"I Want a Boy\\", \\"What's So Sweet About Sweet Sixteen\\", \\"I'm Gonna Quit While I'm Ahead\\", and \\"My Guiding Angel\\". Colpix released \\"I Want a Boy\\" in August 1961 and \\"I'm Gonna Quit While I'm Ahead\\" in January 1962, the first singles credited to Ronnie and the Relatives. While both singles failed to chart on the Billboard Top 100, fate intervened in advancing the group's success. A fortuitous case of mistaken identity led to Ronnie and the Relatives making their debut ‚Äì as dancers rather than a singing act ‚Äì at New York City's hip The Peppermint Lounge in 1961. It was the height of the Twist craze, and under-aged Nedra and Ronnie disguised themselves to get in. The girls' mothers showed them how to put on make-up and fix their hair to make them look at least 23. When they arrived outside the club, its manager mistook Ronnie, Estelle, and Nedra for the trio supposed to dance behind house band Joey Dee and the Starliters for the evening. He led them in and put them onstage to perform in their place. During the show, Starliter David Brigati even handed the mike over to Ronnie when she started to sing Ray Charles' \\"What'd I Say\\". Soon afterward, Ronnie and the Relatives became a permanent act at The Peppermint Lounge, each earning $10 per night to dance The Twist and usually sing a song at some point in the show. Ronnie and the Relatives soon became ‚ÄúThe Ronettes‚Äù. Colpix issued the first two singles credited to the Ronettes, \\"Silhouettes\\" and a re-issue of \\"I'm Gonna Quit While I'm Ahead\\", on its May label in April and June 1962, respectively. Both singles disappointingly failed to chart. Later that year, they were flown to Miami to open a Florida branch of The Peppermint Lounge. After their performance at the Miami gala, radio host Murray the K came backstage and introduced himself to them. He asked the women to begin appearing at his shows at The Brooklyn Fox in New York. They agreed, taking the Fox stage in 1962 and completing a transition from Murray the K's \\"Dancing Girls\\", to back-up singing for other acts, to performing as the Ronettes before year's end. It was during this time that the women evolved their iconic look, wearing ever more exaggerated eye make-up while teasing their hair to impossible proportions. \\"We'd look pretty wild by the time we got out onstage,\\" Ronnie later recalled, \\"and the kids loved it.\\" Colpix's May label issued a final single by the Ronettes in March 1963. When \\"Good Girls\\" failed to chart, the women decided to look elsewhere for studio work. Phil Spector and Philles Records (1963‚Äì1966) The Ronettes in 1966 In early 1963, fed up with Colpix Records and the group's lack of success, sister Estelle placed a phone call to producer Phil Spector and told him the Ronettes would like to audition for him. Spector agreed and met the women soon after at Mira Sound Studios in New York City. Later, Spector told Ronnie that he had seen them at The Brooklyn Fox several times and was impressed with their performances. At the audition, Spector was sitting at a piano, and when the group began singing \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\\", he suddenly jumped up from his seat and shouted: \\"That's it! That's it! That's the voice I've been looking for!\\" After their successful audition, Spector decided to sign the group. Originally, he wanted to sign Ronnie as a solo act, until her mother told him either he signed the Ronettes as a group or it was no deal. He agreed to sign the group and instructed Ronnie's mother to inform Colpix Records that the women had \\"given up\\" on show business so the studio would release their contract. By March 1963, the group was officially signed to Spector's Philles Records. The first song the Ronettes rehearsed and recorded with Phil Spector was written by Spector, Jeff Barry, and Ellie Greenwich called \\"Why Don't They Let Us Fall in Love\\". They brought the women out to California to make the record, but, once it was completed, Spector declined to release it. They recorded more songs for Spector, including covers of \\"The Twist\\", \\"The Wah-Watusi\\" (lead vocals by Nedra), \\"Mashed Potato Time\\", and \\"Hot Pastrami\\". These four songs were released, but were credited to The Crystals on their 1963 Philles LP The Crystals Sing Their Greatest Hits, Volume 1. =\\"Be My Baby\\"= After having been denied a release of their song as well as having credit for their next four recordings go to another group, the Ronettes went to work on the Phil Spector/Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich song \\"Be My Baby\\". The Ronettes recorded \\"Be My Baby\\" in July 1963, and it was released by August. \\"Be My Baby\\" was a smash record for the Ronettes. Radio stations played the song throughout fall of 1963, and the Ronettes were invited to tour the country with Dick Clark on his \\"Caravan of Stars\\" tour. \\"Be My Baby\\" inspired a legion of Ronettes fans, including Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys, who clearly intended \\"Don't Worry Baby\\" as an homage to the group. By autumn that year, it was a Top 10 hit and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Top 100. \\"Our lives were turned upside down,\\" Ronnie later recalled. \\"All the things I'd ever dreamed about were finally coming true.\\" \\"Be My Baby\\" is also notable for being the first recording by Cher, who performed back-up vocals with Estelle, Nedra, and Sonny Bono. As the girlfriend of Bono, who was working for Phil Spector at the time, Cher was asked to join the back-up singers when one was a no-show. \\"'Be My Baby' was the first record I ever sang on,\\" Cher later wrote. \\"... I went out and stood in front of this big speaker and sang 'be my, be my baby' with the Ronettes and all these other singers.\\" After \\"Be My Baby\\", Cher became a permanent back-up singer on recordings by the Ronettes, as well as other songs Phil Spector produced until \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\\". =\\"Baby, I Love You\\"= After the overnight success of their first Phil Spector single, Spector was eager to do a follow-up with the Ronettes. He wrote \\"Baby, I Love You\\", again with Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich, and urged the Ronettes to leave New York for California to record the song at Gold Star Studios. A problem arose when the Ronettes were scheduled to leave for Dick Clark's \\"Caravan of Stars\\" tour across the United States. In lieu of having the Ronettes skip the Dick Clark tour, Spector decided Estelle and Nedra would do the tour with cousin Elaine, a former member of the group. Ronnie left for California to record \\"Baby, I Love You\\" with Darlene Love, Cher, and Sonny Bono subbing for Estelle and Nedra on back- up vocals. \\"Baby, I Love You\\" had an even denser arrangement, featuring Leon Russell on piano. The song was recorded in the early fall of 1963 and released in November that year. It was slightly less successful than \\"Be My Baby\\" on the charts, reaching number 24 Pop, number 6 R&B; in the United States and number 11 in the United Kingdom.[ allmusic ((( The Ronettes > Biography )))] =A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector= All three Ronettes, along with every other artist who was signed with Phil Spector in 1963, were featured on the Christmas LP A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector. For this album, the Ronettes recorded three songs: \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\", \\"Frosty the Snowman\\", and \\"Sleigh Ride\\". All artists sang on the album's finale, \\"Silent Night\\", which opened with a spoken message from Phil Spector, wishing a Merry Christmas and thanking everyone for supporting the cooperative artists. In his desire for absolute perfection on the album, Spector pushed his artists to belt out their lyrics as powerfully as they could. \\"The Christmas album was the one where I'd thought I'd lost it mentally.\\" Nedra later said. \\"I heard the parts. I swore I'd put them down, but they said it wasn't on the tape.\\" The album was released on the day President Kennedy was assassinated. It was not a success upon its initial release but has since become considerably more popular. It was re-released by Apple Records in 1972 and reached No. 6 on Billboard‚Ä≤s list of Christmas Albums that year. =British tour, \\"Breakin' Up\\", and \\"Do I Love You?\\"= In January 1964, the Ronettes left for their first tour of the UK, where they made a strong impact from the very beginning. \\"We must have been quite a sight in the Heathrow waiting room,\\" Ronnie Spector later recalled, \\"three black American girls sitting with their legs all crossed the same way, our three identical, enormous hairdos piled a foot or so over our heads. When our young chaperon finally showed up, he was all smiles.\\" On their first night in the UK, the women attended a party at Tony Hall's house where they met the Beatles. After meeting, Ronnie and John Lennon became fast friends, remaining so until Lennon's death. Estelle and George Harrison also spent time together. But for Ronnie, one of the biggest thrills was meeting Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, who were the opening act for the Ronettes on their UK tour. The feeling was mutually shared by Richards, who wrote of his relationship with Ronnie: \\"The first time I ever went to heaven was when I awoke with Ronnie (later Spector!) Bennett asleep with a smile on her face. We were kids. It doesn't get any better than that.\\" When the women returned home from their British tour, they went right back into the studio to record \\"Keep on Dancing\\" and \\"Girls Can Tell\\", two songs written by Jeff Barry, Ellie Greenwich and Phil Spector. The group's recording of \\"Keep on Dancing\\" is notable because it features Ronnie and Nedra singing in unison, but Spector refused to release the single. Around this time, The Crystals also recorded a version of \\"Girls Can Tell\\", which also went unreleased. \\"(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up\\" was subsequently recorded by the Ronettes. According to Ronnie, Spector was especially enthusiastic about the song. \\"When Phil loved a song as much as he loved '(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up,'\\" she later wrote, \\"he could work on it for days without ever getting tired.\\" Released in April 1964, the song did not fare as well as the group's previous two singles, though it did manage to briefly break into the Billboard Top 40. In June 1964, the group's following single, \\"Do I Love You?\\", was released, also breaking into the Top 40, beating their previous single by five positions. The song is most notable for its powerful instrumental opening, accompanied by finger snapping and hand clapping. =\\"Walking in the Rain\\"= As the British Invasion took full force on the American music scene in 1964, the Ronettes were one of the few groups that were able to maintain their relevance. When they toured the UK in January 1964, they had been asked by John Lennon to accompany the Beatles on their flight to America on February 7, 1964, but Spector denied them the opportunity to do so. Instead, throughout 1964, the group appeared on numerous television shows such as Shindig!, American Bandstand, Hullabaloo, and British TV show Ready, Steady, Go! As the popularity of other groups such as The Crystals, The Marvelettes, and The Angels began to wane, that of the Ronettes continued to grow. In the summer of 1964, Ronnie went into the studio to record her lead on the group's next single, \\"Walking in the Rain\\". She later recalled that the writers ‚Äì Phil Spector, Barry Mann, and Cynthia Weil ‚Äì were still adjusting the lyrics right up to the minute she recorded it. Ronnie recalled Phil placing headphones on her and telling her to listen closely. \\"Everything was quiet,\\" she later wrote, \\"Then all of a sudden I heard a low rumble, like there was thunder coming from every corner of the room.\\" The thunder was used for the introduction and was featured prominently throughout the remainder of the song, the only one of which Ronnie recorded in a single take. \\"Walking in the Rain\\" became the group's most successful single since \\"Be My Baby\\" (released over a year earlier) and peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100. Following the successful release of \\"Walking in the Rain\\", Philles Records released the group's first studio album, Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes featuring Veronica, in late 1964. The album proved to be slightly successful, peaking at number 96 on the Billboard charts, but it is notable for being the first evidence of Phil Spector publicly promoting lead singer Veronica \\"Ronnie\\" Bennett over Estelle Bennett and Nedra Talley. Every Ronettes single after this referred to the group as \\"The Ronettes featuring Veronica\\" on the record labels. =Decline in popularity= After the success of \\"Walking in the Rain\\", the Ronettes' popularity had clearly begun to wane. In February 1965, Philles Records released the group's next single, \\"Born to Be Together\\", which only reached number 52 on the Billboard 100. Over the course of the next year, the Ronettes recorded a song catalog which, once completed, Phil Spector refused to release. Many attribute this to his insecurities and growing love for Ronnie. As the popularity of the group rose, their relationship grew deeper, and soon they were living together. Spector allegedly did not want the Ronettes to become too popular, in fear they would one day outshine him, perhaps explaining why he did not release recordings the Ronettes were contractually obligated to make. This allowed for the Motown group the Supremes to eclipse them to become the most popular female group of the time. Some recorded yet unreleased songs include: \\"Paradise\\", \\"Everything Under the Sun\\", and \\"I Wish I Never Saw the Sun Shine\\". All three have since been covered by among others, the Shangri-Las, the Supremes, and Ike & Tina Turner. Regrettably, Spector‚Äôs choice was to not release the Spector/ Jeff Barry/ Ellie Greenwich song \\"Chapel of Love\\", initially recorded by the Ronettes in early 1964. By the time their version finally was released, The Dixie Cups had already achieved notoriety for it. \\"We thought it was such a great record that we practically begged [Phil Spector] to put it out,\\" Ronnie Spector later wrote. \\"Then the Dixie Cups' version came out, and it was a smash! It was so depressing.\\" In June 1965, the Ronettes' next single, \\"Is This What I Get For Loving You?\\", was released, becoming a minor hit, reaching only number 75 on the Billboard 100. However, the song proved popular for TV appearances on Hullabaloo, Hollywood A Go-Go, and Shivaree. The Ronettes failed to achieve another Top 10 hit, while the Supremes scored their fifth consecutive number-one song with \\"Back in My Arms Again\\". Some have attributed the decline of their popularity partially to Phil Spector‚Äôs unenthusiastic promotions of the Ronettes, possibly from insecurities stemming from his intimate relationship with Ronnie. There were internal problems within the group as well. \\"You also have to remember that Nedra and Estelle stood in the background while I got to bask in the spotlight,\\" Ronnie later wrote. \\"I was the one who flew out to California and sang lead on all our records. I was the one deejays wanted to talk to. And I was the one our producer was in love with, which meant I get the preferential treatment in all kinds of other ways which [quite understandably] drove them crazy.\\" \\"I hated the 'dog-eat-dog' side of show-business,\\" Nedra Talley later commented. \\"I hated pushing for the next record and the feeling of failure if we didn't get it. There was a continual demand on us to produce that I thought was unfair. My personality didn't like that.\\" Nedra's disdain for show business fueled her choice to marry Scott Ross. =Opening for the Beatles= After \\"Is This What I Get for Loving You?\\" was released in June 1965, over a year passed before the Ronettes' next single was released. \\"I Can Hear Music\\", written by Phil Spector/Jeff Barry/Ellie Greenwich and produced by Barry, was issued in October 1966, barely making it into the Billboard 100 by peaking at number 100 for exactly one week before it fell off the charts. The song was covered by the Beach Boys in 1969 with much greater success. After \\"Be My Baby\\", the Ronettes became headliners at several Murray the K Holiday Shows in NYC and did package tours in the US and England. By late 1965, even without a recent hit, the group continued to make appearances at popular night clubs and on television shows, grace the covers of music magazines, and be featured on The Big TNT Show, produced by Phil Spector as a concert, and filmed and released as a TV movie. In August 1966, the Ronettes teamed up with the Beatles for a 14-city tour across America. Phil Spector became so enraged when Ronnie expressed a desire to accompany Estelle and Nedra on the tour that Ronnie was forced to remain in California with him while the girls' cousin Elaine, who had previously been in the group, filled her slot on the tour, while Nedra or Estelle assumed the lead vocals on stage. A picture published in the November 1966 issue of Ebony magazine, showed Nedra Talley singing lead, while Estelle and Elaine stood behind her singing harmony. Break-up After their tour with the Beatles ended, and \\"I Can Hear Music\\" failed to make an impact, the Ronettes left for a tour in Germany in early 1967, after which they agreed to break up and go their separate ways. Soon afterward, Nedra Talley married her boyfriend Scott Ross, Ronnie Bennett married Phil Spector, and Estelle Bennett settled down with Joe Dong, a long-time boyfriend. According to her accounts, Phil Spector kept Ronnie a virtual prisoner in their 23-room mansion in California. He brought her into the studio only once during their marriage. During this session, which took place in early 1969 at A&M; Records, she recorded \\"You Came, You Saw, You Conquered!\\" The song was released in March 1969, failing to make an impact on radio stations, which were now playing music in the style of Janis Joplin and Grace Slick. Later in 1969, Ronnie and Estelle were invited into the studio by Jimi Hendrix to record backing vocals on \\"Earth Blues\\". Their work on the song earned the Ronettes a credit on the LP Rainbow Bridge.Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, or My Life as a Fabulous Ronette p. 322. =The Ronettes briefly return= Ronnie left Phil on June 12, 1972. The couple's divorce was finalized two years later in 1974. As she made an attempt to restore her career, she decided to reform the Ronettes. Nedra had no interest in returning to the group, and Estelle mentally could no longer handle the burden of performing due to her struggle with mental illness. Ronnie then replaced them with Chip Fields (mother of The Facts of Life and Living Single star Kim Fields) and Denise Edwards. Ronnie, Chip, and Denise recorded some songs for Buddah Records in 1973, one of which was a cover of \\"I Wish I Never Saw the Sun Shine\\", a song Ronnie had first done in 1965, though Phil Spector had refused to release it. The stint at Buddah Records was not successful, though the group made several tours in the 1970s. By the end of the decade, Ronnie had abandoned the idea of continuing the Ronettes and began her solo career. Later years Ronnie Spector in 2010 singing \\"Be My Baby\\" to Michael Musto In 1988, the original Ronettes filed a lawsuit in New York against Phil Spector over unpaid royalties and for unpaid income he made from licensing of Ronettes‚Äô music. It took the case a decade to make its way to trial. In 2000, Spector was ordered to pay them more than $2.6 million. Spector appealed and in 2001 the state Supreme Court's Appellate Division upheld a lower court finding that Spector had violated his 1963 contract. He appealed that ruling as well, taking the case to the New York State Supreme Court in 2002. In its ruling, the State Court of Appeals said it found the Ronettes' \\"plight sympathetic, because they have earned less than $15,000 in royalties from songs that topped the charts and made them famous,\\" but the judges found that their contract gave Spector unconditional rights to the recordings. The judges also reversed a lower court's ruling that they were entitled to the music industry's standard 50 percent royalty rate on sales of records, tapes and compact discs. The final outcome had Spector paying a judgment in excess of $1.5 million to the Ronettes. In 2009, Estelle died of colon cancer at the age of 67 in Englewood, New Jersey. In 2017, Ronnie Spector released a new single Love Power under the name Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes making it the first Ronettes single in decades.\\"Ronnie Spector and The Ronettes 'Love Power' Premiere\\", People.com. Awards and recognition The Ronettes were nominated for a Grammy Award in 1965 for \\"Walking in the Rain\\". They were inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for \\"Be My Baby\\" in 1999. The Ronettes were also inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 and the People's Hall of Rock and Roll Legends in 2010. The Ronettes' influence on music was significant. In addition to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen have both cited Ronnie Bennett as an influence. The Ronettes' fashion style was emulated by British musician Amy Winehouse. It was reported that Phil Spector, in his capacity as a member of the Board of Governors, resisted the Ronettes (and Darlene Love) being nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, although they had been eligible for a considerable length of time. The alleged reasons included the acrimonious divorce of Ronnie and Spector, in addition to the group's having successfully sued Spector for back royalties. Spector claimed that, apart from Ronnie, the other group members did not appear on their records, and that they did not make the contribution required for induction.\\"Phil Spector blasts The Ronettes' Hall Of Fame induction\\", NME, March 7, 2007. Retrieved August 28, 2014. While Spector was awaiting trial on a murder charge and out on $1 million bail, the Ronettes were finally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 12, 2007, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. Keith Richards, a longtime fan, inducted the trio. Ronnie Bennett (Spector) and Nedra Talley performed \\"Baby, I Love You\\", \\"Walking in the Rain\\", and \\"Be My Baby\\". Estelle Bennett was present to accept her award, but was not well enough to perform, so Tricia Scotti (a regular backup singer with Ronnie) took her place behind the microphone.

History The group was formed in Nashville, Tennessee in 1964 when Bill Justis (best known for his hit \\"Raunchy\\") became their manager and formed Buckhorn Music with the help of Wilkin's mother, Marijohn Wilkin, a country music writer. Signed to Mala Records, a sublabel of Bell Records, their primary contribution to popular music was in injecting country-sounds into the burgeoning surf rock scene. Their 1964 debut single \\"G.T.O.\\" reached No. 4 on the Billboard Pop Singles chart. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. A subsequent single, \\"Bucket T\\" reached No. 54 on the Billboard chart that same year. After an album and tour in 1964, Ronny & The Daytonas had another hit in 1965 with a ballad, \\"Sandy\\", and an album that reflected a similar country- inflected surfer sound. In 1966 Ronny and The Daytonas switched to RCA Records and released a romantic ballad called \\"Diane, Diane\\" and the upbeat \\"All American Girl\\", both of which had some success on the charts. The band toured for a short time after this before disbanding. In 1965, Buzz Cason and John \\"Bucky\\" Wilkin recorded the single \\"Bay City\\" / \\"Tiger A-Go-Go\\" as Buzz and Bucky. The single did not enter the Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The mid-1980s saw some interest in re-uniting various band members for a few engagements. The last known appearances of The Daytonas were at a concert in upstate New York on July 4, 1995, at the Woodward Dream Cruise in Michigan in 2000 and 2002, and at The Baby Boomer Legends concert at \\"The Factory\\" in Franklin, Tennessee on April 24, 2015. , Buck Wilkin Music publishing was licensing Ronny & The Daytonas songs for the U.S. and Canada, and occasionally published their music on 180 gram vinyl media in limited production runs.

The Surfaris were inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in 2019 for their hit instrumental song, \\"Wipe Out\\". Career The original band members were Ron Wilson (drums, vocals), Jim Fuller (lead guitar), Bob Berryhill (rhythm guitar), and Pat Connolly (bass). In the fall of 1962, Southern California high school students Jim Fuller and Pat Connolly were a guitar duo before founding The Surfaris in high school after meeting drummer Ron Wilson at a high school dance. After practicing at fellow student Bob Berryhill's house, they added him as the fourth member. \\"Wipe Out\\" was written and recorded by the quartet later that winter, with the song reaching #2 nationally in 1963 before becoming an international hit. Saxophone player Jim Pash joined after their \\"Wipe Out\\" / \\"Surfer Joe\\" recording sessions at Pal Studios. Ken Forssi, later of Love, played bass with The Surfaris after Pat Connolly. \\"Wipe Out\\" Wilson's energetic drum solo made \\"Wipe Out\\" one of the best-remembered instrumental songs of the period. \\"Wipe Out\\" is also remembered particularly for its introduction. Before the music starts, Berryhill's dad broke a board (imitating a breaking surf board) near the mic, followed by a maniacal laugh and the words \\"Wipe Out\\" spoken by band manager Dale Smallin. \\"Wipe Out\\" was written in the studio by the four original members (Berryhill, Connolly, Fuller, and Wilson). It was initially issued on the tiny DFS label (#11/12) in January 1963. It was reissued on the tiny Princess label (#50) in February 1963. It was picked up by Dot (45-16479) in April 1963, and later reissued as Dot 45-144 in April 1965. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. Following the death of television personality Morton Downey Jr., news reports and obituaries incorrectly credited him as the composer of \\"Wipe Out\\" (as well as the Chantays' \\"Pipeline\\"). , Downey's official website continued to make this claim but it has been changed to state he \\"also played major roles in the production of the hit surf music-era songs \\"Pipeline\\" and \\"Wipeout\\".\\" Disbanding and reformation The band released a series of records, with two other singles, \\"Surfer Joe\\" (written and sung by Wilson) and \\"Point Panic\\" (another group- composed instrumental), having an impact on the charts. Point Panic is a renowned surfing venue in Hawaii after which the song was named. The original 1963 membership remained intact until August 1965 when Connolly departed before their Japanese tour. Ken Forssi replaced him on bass for the tour. Fuller resigned after the tour and the band folded in early 1966. Forssi died from a brain tumor in 1998. Bob Berryhill currently performs worldwide as The Surfaris who started performing in the 1990s. In 2015, he released a critically acclaimed album entitled The Surfaris Hurley Sessions. Pat Connolly left the music business in 1965. Ron Wilson died of a brain aneurysm on May 12, 1989, one month short of his 45th birthday. Wilson had released an album of his songs, entitled Lost In The Surf, on Bennet House Records of Grass Valley, California, which was recorded in June 1987. A very small number of cassettes of this album were produced. Lost in the Surf included a cover of \\"Louie Louie\\", complete with Scottish bagpipes. Jim Pash, who played saxophone in the earlier formation and was later a guitarist, died April 29, 2005 of heart failure at age 56. Jim Fuller played with main band, The Surfaris band that reformed in the 1980s with Pash. After Berryhill was released from the band in the mid-'80s, new members joined such as Kelly Lammers, Robert Watson, Jay Truax, Paul Johnson (Mr. Moto), and Dave Raven, among others all concurrent with his own band, Jim Fuller and the Beatnik until his passing on March 3, 2017 in Monrovia, California at age 69.https://ultimateclassicrock.com/surfaris-jim-fuller-dead/ On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Surfaris among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The assertions made in the work are thus understood to be factual. While memoir has historically been defined as a subcategory of biography or autobiography since the late 20th century, the genre is differentiated in form, presenting a narrowed focus. A biography or autobiography tells the story \\"of a life\\", while a memoir often tells the story of a particular event or time, such as touchstone moments and turning points from the author's life. The author of a memoir may be referred to as a memoirist or a memorialist. Early memoirs Memoirs have been written since the ancient times, as shown by Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico, also known as Commentaries on the Gallic Wars. In the work, Caesar describes the battles that took place during the nine years that he spent fighting local armies in the Gallic Wars. His second memoir, Commentarii de Bello Civili (or Commentaries on the Civil War) is an account of the events that took place between 49 and 48 BC in the civil war against Gnaeus Pompeius and the Senate. The noted Libanius, teacher of rhetoric who lived between an estimated 314 and 394 AD, framed his life memoir as one of his literary orations, which were written to be read aloud in the privacy of his study. This kind of memoir refers to the idea in ancient Greece and Rome, that memoirs were like \\"memos\\", or pieces of unfinished and unpublished writing, which a writer might use as a memory aid to make a more finished document later on. The Sarashina Nikki is an example of an early Japanese memoir, written in the Heian period. A genre of book writing, Nikki Bungaku, emerged during this time. In the Middle Ages, Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Jean de Joinville, and Philippe de Commines wrote memoirs, while the genre was represented toward the end of the Renaissance, through the works of Blaise de Montluc and Margaret of Valois, that she was the first woman to write her Memoirs in modern-style. Viennot, √âliane, Marguerite de Valois et l'√©criture de l'histoire, 1574-1614, √âtudes √âpist√©m√®, 17, spring 2010. Until the Age of Enlightenment encompassing the 17th and 18th centuries, works of memoir were written by Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury; Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld, Prince de Marcillac of France; and Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon, who wrote Memoirs at his family's home at the castle of La Fert√©-Vidame. While Saint-Simon was considered a writer possessing a high level of skill for narrative and character development, it wasn't until well after his death that his work as a memoirist was recognized, resulting in literary fame.Saintsbury, George (1911). Saint-Simon, Louis de Rouvroy, Duc de, In Chisholm, Hugh. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 24 (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press, pp. 47, 48. From the eighteenth century An excerpt from the manuscript \\"Memoires on Napoleon's campaigns, experienced as a soldier of the second regiment\\", written by Joseph Abbeel, 1805-1815. Over the latter half of the 18th through the mid-20th century, memoirists generally included those who were noted within their chosen profession. These authors wrote as a way to record and publish their own account of their public exploits. Authors included politicians or people in court society and were later joined by military leaders and businessmen. An exception to these models is Henry David Thoreau's 1854 memoir Walden, which presents his experiences over the course of two years in a cabin he built near Walden Pond. Twentieth- century war memoirs became a genre of their own, including, from the First World War, Ernst J√ºnger (Storm of Steel) and Frederic Manning's Her Privates We. Memoirs documenting incarceration by Nazi Germany during the war include Primo Levi's If This Is a Man, which covers his arrest as a member of the Italian Resistance Movement, followed by his life as a prisoner in Auschwitz; and Elie Wiesel's Night, which is based on his life prior to and during his time in the Auschwitz, Buna Werke, and Buchenwald concentration camps. Memoirs today In the early 1990s, memoirs written by ordinary people experienced a sudden upsurge, as an increasing number of people realized that their ancestors‚Äô and their own stories were about to disappear, in part as a result of the opportunities and distractions of technological advances. At the same time, psychology and other research began to show that familiarity with genealogy helps people find their place in the world and that life review helps people come to terms with their own past. With the advent of inexpensive digital book production in the first decade of the 21st century, the genre exploded. Memoirs written as a way to pass down a personal legacy, rather than as a literary work of art or historical document, are emerging as a personal and family responsibility. The Association of Personal Historians was a trade association for professionals who assisted individuals, families, and organizations in documenting their life stories. It dissolved in 2017.  Collections  With the expressed interest of preserving history through the eyes of those who lived it, some organizations work with potential memoirists to bring their work to fruition. The Veterans History Project, for example, compiles the memoirs of those who have served in a branch of the United States Armed Forces ‚Äì especially those who have seen active combat.  Academia  The term 'memoir' has been used in an academic context to describe an essay on a learned subject. Examples include explanatory texts accompanying geologic maps.https://www.worldcat.org/title/amani-memoirs-a-provisional-soil-map-of- east-africa-kenya-uganda-tanganyika-and-zanzibar-with-explanatory- memoir/oclc/6022506 See also * Diary * Fake memoirs * Histoire de ma vie * Last will and testament References Category:Non-fiction genres Category:Works about history ","title":"Memoir"},{"id":"167390","text":"The Twin Earth thought experiment posits a second Earth which is identical in all ways except one Twin Earth is a thought experiment proposed by philosopher Hilary Putnam in his papers \\"Meaning and Reference\\" (1973) and \\"The Meaning of 'Meaning (1975). It is meant to serve as an illustration of his argument for semantic externalism, or the view that the meanings of words are not purely psychological. The Twin Earth thought experiment was one of three examples that Putnam offered in support of semantic externalism, the other two being what he called the Aluminum-Molybdenum case and the Beech-Elm case. Since the publication of these cases, numerous variations on the thought experiment have been proposed by philosophers.  The thought experiment  Putnam's original formulation of the experiment was this: > We begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet > exactly like Earth in virtually all aspects, which we refer to as \\"Twin > Earth\\". (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly > the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly > like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every > person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets > is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that > is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not > of H2O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as > \\"XYZ\\". The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as \\"English\\" call XYZ > \\"water\\". Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several > centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no > means of knowing that the liquids they called \\"water\\" were H2O and XYZ > respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those > on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical. > Now the question arises: when an Earthling (or Oscar for simplicity's sake) > and his twin on Twin Earth say 'water' do they mean the same thing? (The > twin is also called 'Oscar' on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the > inhabitants of that planet call their own planet 'Earth'. For convenience, > we refer to this putative planet as 'Twin Earth', and extend this naming > convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring > to Oscar's twin as Twin Oscar.) Ex hypothesi, they are in identical > psychological states, with the same thoughts, feelings, etc. Yet, at least > according to Putnam, when Oscar says 'water', the term refers to H2O, > whereas when Twin Oscar says 'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is > that the contents of a person's brain are not sufficient to determine the > reference of terms they use, as one must also examine the causal history > that led to this individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, > learned the word 'water' in a world filled with H2O, whereas Twin Oscar > learned 'water' in a world filled with XYZ.) This is the essential thesis of semantic externalism. Putnam famously summarized this conclusion with the statement that meanings' just ain't in the head.\\"Putnam 1975/1985, p. 227 Criticism In his original article, Putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins' \\"water\\" varied even though their psychological states were the same. Tyler Burge subsequently argued in \\"Other Bodies\\" (1982) that the twins' mental states are different: Oscar has the concept H2O, while Twin Oscar has the concept XYZ. Putnam has since expressed agreement with Burge's interpretation of the thought experiment. (See Putnam's introduction in Pessin and Goldberg 1996, xxi.) A number of philosophers have argued that \\"water\\" for both Oscar and Twin Oscar refers to anything that is sufficiently water-like (i.e. the term's extension includes both H2O and XYZ). They reject, therefore, the contention that \\"water\\" is a rigid designator referring to H2O. John Searle, for example, argues (Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind) that, once we discover that our water is H2O, we have the choice of either redefining it as H2O (a classical reduction redefinition) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water (transparency, wetness, etc.). Searle suggests that in the Twin-Earth example, the second seems more plausible, since if Twin Earth doesn't have water, then all its water-based products will also be different. Twin ice cream, for example, will be constitutionally different, yet we will still be tempted to call it ice cream. Searle, along with others, considers this sufficient argument to \\"solve\\" the thought experiment altogether; others, such as Donald Davidson, feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions. Paul Boghossian raised an objection to the class of Twin-Earth-style arguments for externalism in the form of an argument that aims to show that externalism is incompatible with privileged self-knowledge. Here, privileged self-knowledge is taken to be the idea that one can know the content of one's thoughts without having to investigate the external world (for empirical evidence). Although this type of argument does not directly disprove externalism, it is pressing because of the intuitive plausibility of privileged self-knowledge's existence.Boghossian (1998): \\"What the externalist can know a priori\\". Some philosophers believe that such science-fiction thought experiments (like the Twin-Earth) should be examined carefully. They argue that when a thought experiment describes a state of affairs that is radically different from the actual one (or what we think it to be), our intuitions can become unreliable, and hence the philosophical conclusions drawn from them may also be unreliable. Daniel Dennett calls Twin Earth and other experiments like it \\"intuition pumps\\", as they are designed in such a way to allow the thinker to use their intuition to guide them through the problem. Some philosophers take the Twin-Earth thought experiment/intuition pump to engage faulty intuitions, and hence lead to faulty conclusions. Phil Hutchinson,Hutchinson (2008): 'Shame and Philosophy (chapter 1, section 2). for example, notes that a) if one looks at Putnam's own later criticisms of others (for example his criticisms of Jaegwon Kim in his book The Threefold Cord) one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self; and b) that the persuasive power of the Twin Earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which Putnam claims it to. In short, the thought experiment is set up in such a way that one's intuitions will be pumped in the desired direction. John McDowell, in his paper \\"Putnam on Mind and Meaning\\",see John McDowell (1998): \\"Putnam on Mind and Meaning\\". In: id., Mind, Meaning and Reality. criticised Putnam for still having in play a latent commitment to a picture of the mind as modelled on the brain and located in the head. Putnam has since conceded the point and subscribes to McDowell's neo-Wittgensteinian therapeutic invocation of the mind as a structured system of object involving abilities (what Putnam has since defended as a neo-Aristotelian picture of mindSee his papers \\"Changing Aristotle's Mind\\" and \\"Aristotle after Wittgenstein\\", both reprinted in Putnam (1994): Words and Life.). Phil Hutchinson has since argued that this concession to McDowell means that the distinction which Putnam wishes to operationalize, between intension and extension, is now problematized.Hutchinson (2008): Shame and Philosophy (chapter 1). John Dupr√©, in a number of papers and mainly in his paper \\"Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa\\",Reprinted in John Dupre (2002): Humans and Other Animals. has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds, which many have taken to be established and/or supported by Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification. Avrum Stroll has produced probably the most comprehensive critique of the program of natural kind semantics (both Putnam's and Kripke's) in his book Sketches of Landscapes.Avrum Stroll (1998): Sketches of Landscapes. Putnam, who is well known for changing his philosophical positions on a variety of issues, criticized the experiment later in life because it is anti-functionalist.

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of gospel music varies according to culture and social context. Gospel music is composed and performed for many purposes, including aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, and as an entertainment product for the marketplace. Gospel music usually has dominant vocals (often with strong use of harmony) with Christian lyrics. Gospel music can be traced to the early 17th century. Hymns and sacred songs were often repeated in a call and response fashion. Most of the churches relied on hand clapping and foot stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. Most of the singing was done a cappella.Jackson, Joyce Marie. \\"The changing nature of gospel music: A southern case study.\\" African American Review 29.2 (1995): 185. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. Web. October 5, 2010. The first published use of the term \\"gospel song\\" probably appeared in 1874. The original gospel songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. Gospel music publishing houses emerged. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music. Following World War II, gospel music moved into major auditoriums, and gospel music concerts became quite elaborate. Black gospel, by far the most well-known variant, emerged out of the African-American music tradition and has evolved in various ways over the years, continuing to form the basis of Black church worship even today. It has also come to be used in churches of various other cultural traditions (especially within Pentecostalism) and, via the gospel choir phenomenon spearheaded by Thomas Dorsey, has become a form of musical devotion worldwide. Southern gospel used all male, tenor-lead-baritone-bass quartet make-up. Progressive Southern gospel is an American music genre that has grown out of Southern gospel over the past couple of decades. Christian country music, sometimes referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair. It peaked in popularity in the mid-1990s. Bluegrass gospel music is rooted in American mountain music. Celtic gospel music infuses gospel music with a Celtic flair, and is quite popular in countries such as Ireland. British black gospel refers to Gospel music of the African diaspora produced in the UK. Some proponents of \\"standard\\" hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Today, with historical distance, there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals.  History  According to Yale University music professor Willie Ruff, the singing of psalms in Gaelic by Presbyterians of the Scottish Hebrides evolved from \\"lining out\\"‚Äîwhere one person sang a solo and others followed‚Äîinto the call and response of gospel music of the American South. Another theory notes foundations in the works of Dr. Isaac Watts and others. Moreover, the genre arose during a time when literacy was not a guarantee, utilizing a great deal of repetition (which, unlike more traditional hymns, allowed those who could not read the opportunity to participate). = 18th century = Perhaps the most famous gospel-based hymns were composed in the 1760s and 1770s by English writers John Newton (\\"Amazing Grace\\") and Augustus Toplady (\\"Rock of Ages\\"), members of the Anglican Church. Starting out as lyrics only, it took decades for standardized tunes to be added to them. Although not directly connected with African-American gospel music, they were adopted by African-Americans as well as white Americans, and Newton's connection with the abolition movement provided cross-fertilization. = Holiness-Pentecostal era (19th century) = Philip Paul Bliss The first published use of the term \\"Gospel song\\" probably appeared in 1874 when Philip Bliss released a songbook entitled Gospel Songs. A Choice Collection of Hymns and Tunes. It was used to describe a new style of church music, songs that were easy to grasp and more easily singable than the traditional church hymns, which came out of the mass revival movement starting with Dwight L. Moody, whose musician was Ira D. Sankey, as well as the Holiness-Pentecostal movement. Prior to the meeting of Moody and Sankey in 1870, there was an American rural/frontier history of revival and camp meeting songs, but the gospel hymn was of a different character, and it served the needs of mass revivals in the great cities. The revival movement employed popular singers and song leaders, the most famous of them being Ira D. Sankey. The original \\"gospel\\" songs were written and composed by authors such as George F. Root, Philip Bliss, Charles H. Gabriel, William Howard Doane, and Fanny Crosby. As an extension to his initial publication Gospel Songs, Philip Bliss, in collaboration with Ira D. Sankey issued no's. 1 to 6 of Gospel Hymns in 1875.Benson, Louis F. The English Hymn: Its Development and Use in Worship. New York: George H. Doran Co., 1915, p. 486. Several sources cite the Bliss and Sankey 1875 publication as the first to use the word \\"gospel\\" in this sense. For example, . Sankey and Bliss's collection can be found in many libraries today. The popularity of revival singers and the openness of rural churches to this type of music (in spite of its initial use in city revivals) led to the late 19th and early 20th century establishment of gospel music publishing houses such as those of Homer Rodeheaver, E. O. Excell, Charlie Tillman, and Charles Tindley. These publishers were in the market for large quantities of new music, providing an outlet for the creative work of many songwriters and composers.Hall, Jacob Henry. Biography of Gospel Song and Hymn Writers. New York: Fleming H. Revell Company, 1914, provides contemporary information about songwriters, composers and publishers. The advent of radio in the 1920s greatly increased the audience for gospel music, and James D. Vaughan used radio as an integral part of his business model, which also included traveling quartets to publicize the gospel music books he published several times a year.See also Charles Davis Tillman. Virgil O. Stamps and Jesse R. Baxter studied Vaughan's business model and by the late 1920s were running heavy competition for Vaughan. The 1920s also saw the marketing of gospel records by groups such as the Carter Family. = Emergence of Black gospel (1920s-1970s) = Mahalia Jackson has been called the \\"Queen of [Black] Gospel\\". The Pentecostal movement quickly made inroads with churches not attuned to the Europeanized Black church music that had become popular over the years since Emancipation. These congregations readily adopted and contributed to the gospel music publications of the early 20th century. Sister Rosetta Tharpe, pioneer of rock and roll, soon emerged from this tradition as the first great gospel recording artist. The first person to introduce ragtime to gospel (and the first to play piano on a gospel recording) was Arizona Dranes. The 1930s saw the rise of Black gospel quartets such as the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi and the Five Blind Boys of Alabama. In addition to these high-profile quartets, there were many Black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing in the streets of Southern cities. In the 1930s, in Chicago, Thomas A. Dorsey turned to gospel music, establishing a publishing house. It has been said that 1930 was the year traditional black gospel music began, as the National Baptist Convention first publicly endorsed the music at its 1930 meeting. Dorsey was responsible for developing the musical careers of many African-American artists, such as Mahalia Jackson (best-known for her rendition of his \\"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\\"). Meanwhile, radio continued to develop an audience for gospel music, a fact that was commemorated in Albert E. Brumley's 1937 song, \\"Turn Your Radio On\\" (which is still being published in gospel song books). (In 1972, a recording of \\"Turn Your Radio On\\" by the Lewis Family was nominated for Gospel Song of the Year.)\\"The Gospel Music Association's Dove Awards Nominations for the Gospel Song of 1972,\\" Canaan Records (Waco, TX) CAS-9732-LP Stereo. In 1964, the Gospel Music Association was established, which in turn began the Dove Awards (in 1969) and the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (in 1972). Both of the latter two groups began primarily for Southern gospel performers, but in the late-1970s, began including artists of other sub-genres, which brought in many Black artists. Also in 1969, James Cleveland established the Gospel Music Workshop of America, a Black gospel outlet. Late 20th-century musicians such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, and the Blackwood Brothers were also known for their gospel influences and recordings. = Contemporary Black gospel and gospel rap (1970s-present) = Urban contemporary gospel emerged in the late 70s, with artists such as the Clark Sisters and Andrae Crouch crossing over musically and gaining notoriety, and this pattern would repeat itself in subsequent decades, with new artists like Yolanda Adams and Kirk Franklin making increasingly more bold forays into the secular world with their musical stylings. The current sphere of Black gospel recording artists is almost exclusively of the urban contemporary bent. Also of note is the rise of Christian (or gospel) rap/hip-hop, which has gained increasing popularity since the days of the Gospel Gangstaz and The Cross Movement. Often considered a subgenre of urban contemporary gospel, Christian rap has become dominated in present times by artists from Reach Records, who have seen perhaps the most commercial success of any artists in the gospel genre; Lecrae (the label's founder and preeminent artist) has charted in the top 10 of on the Billboard 200 three times, with his 2014 album \\"Anomaly\\" debuting at #1.  Subgenres = Black gospel = Traditional  Traditional Black gospel music is the most well-known form, often seen in Black churches, non-Black Pentecostal and evangelical churches, and in entertainment spaces across the country and world. It originates from the Southeastern United States (\\"the South\\"), where most Black Americans lived prior to the Great Migration. This music was highly influenced by the hymnody of the spirituals and of Watts and, later, the musical style and vision of Dosey. Whereas northern Black churches did not at first welcome Dorsey's music (having become accustomed to their own more Eurocentric flavorings), after the Southern migrants' new churches became more popular, so did gospel music, gospel choirs, and the general trend toward exclusive use of this music in Black churches. Dorsey, Mahalia Jackson, the Mississippi Mass Choir, and the Georgia Mass Choir are but a few notable examples.  Urban contemporary  Developing out of the fusion of traditional Black gospel with the styles of secular Black music popular in the 70s and 80s, Urban Contemporary gospel is the most common form of recorded gospel music today. It relies heavily on rhythms and instrumentation common in the secular music of the contemporary era (often including the use of electronic beats), while still incorporating the themes and heritage of the traditional Black gospel genre. Kirk Franklin is the foremost (and by far the best-selling) individual this genre, while Andrae Crouch, the Clark Sisters, and Yolanda Adams are also very popular and noteworthy.  British  British black gospel refers to gospel music of the African diaspora in the UK. It is also often referred to as \\"UK gospel\\". The distinctive sound is heavily influenced by UK street culture with many artists from the African and Caribbean majority black churches in the UK. The genre has gained recognition in various awards such as the GEM (Gospel Entertainment Music) Awards, MOBO Awards, Urban Music Awards and has its own Official Christian & Gospel Albums Chart. = Southern gospel music = Southern gospel music comes from the Southeastern United States and is similar in sound to Christian country music, but it sometimes known as \\"quartet music\\" for its traditional \\"four men and a piano\\" set up. It has evolved over the years into a popular form of music across the United States and overseas, especially among baby boomers and those living in the South. Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of southern gospel varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. = Christian country music = Christian country music, sometimes referred to as country gospel music, is a subgenre of gospel music with a country flair, is also known as inspirational country. Christian country over the years has progressed into a mainstream country sound with inspirational or positive country lyrics. In the mid-1990s, Christian country hit its highest popularity. So much so that mainstream artists like Larry Gatlin, Charlie Daniels and Barbara Mandrell, just to name a few, began recording music that had this positive Christian country flair. These mainstream artists have now become award winners in this genre.  Comparison to other hymnody  Some proponents of \\"standard\\" hymns generally dislike gospel music of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For example, Patrick and Sydnor complain that commercial success led to a proliferation of such music, and \\"deterioration, even in a standard which to begin with was not high, resulted.\\" They went on to say, \\"there is no doubt that a deterioration in taste follows the use of this type of hymn and tune; it fosters an attachment to the trivial and sensational which dulls and often destroys sense of the dignity and beauty which best befit the song that is used in the service of God.\\" Gold reviewed the issue in 1958, and collected a number of quotations similar to the complaints of Patrick and Sydnor. However, he also provided this quotation: \\"Gospel hymnody has the distinction of being America's most typical contribution to Christian song. As such, it is valid in its inspiration and in its employment.\\"Stevenson, Robert. Religion in Life, Winter, 1950‚Äì51Gold, Charles E. \\"The Gospel Song: Contemporary Opinion,\\" The Hymn. v. 9, no. 3 (July 1958), p. 70. Today, with historical distance, there is a greater acceptance of such gospel songs into official denominational hymnals. For example, the United Methodist Church made this acceptance explicit in The Faith We Sing, a 2000 supplement to the official denominational hymnal. In the preface, the editors say, \\"Experience has shown that some older treasures were missed when the current hymnals were compiled.\\"Hickman, Hoyt L., ed. \\"Introduction,\\" The Faith We Sing (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 2000).

The scream is often used when someone is shot, falls from a great height, or is thrown from an explosion. The sound is named after Private Wilhelm, a character in The Charge at Feather River, a 1953 Western in which the character gets shot in the thigh with an arrow, and is believed to be voiced by actor and singer Sheb Wooley. This was its first use from the Warner Bros. stock sound library, although The Charge at Feather River is believed to have been the third film to use the effect. The effect gained new popularity (its use often becoming an in-joke) after it was used in the Star Wars franchise, the Indiana Jones films, and animated Disney and Pixar films such as the Toy Story and Cars series, Up, Monsters University, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Hercules, and Game of Thrones. Many other blockbuster films, television programs, cartoons, and video games have also made use of the scream. History The Wilhelm scream originates from a series of sound effects recorded for the 1951 movie Distant Drums. In a scene from the film, soldiers are wading through a swamp in the Everglades, and one of them is bitten and dragged underwater by an alligator. The scream for that scene was recorded later in a single take, along with five other short, pained screams, which were labelled \\"man getting bit by an alligator, and he screamed.\\" The fifth scream was used for the soldier in the alligator scene‚Äîbut the fourth and sixth screams recorded in the session were also used earlier in the film ‚Äî reportedly when three Native Americans are shot during a raid on a fort. Although takes 4, 5, and 6 are the most recognizable, all the screams are referred to as \\"Wilhelm\\" by those in the sound community. The Wilhelm scream's major breakout in popular culture came from motion picture sound designer Ben Burtt, who discovered the original recording (which he found as a studio reel labeled \\"Man being eaten by alligator\\") and incorporated it into a scene in Star Wars in which Luke Skywalker shoots a Stormtrooper off of a ledge, with the effect being used as the Stormtrooper is falling. Burtt is credited with naming the scream after Private Wilhelm (see The Charge at Feather River). Over the next decade, Burtt began incorporating the effect in other films on which he worked, including most projects involving George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, notably the rest of the subsequent Star Wars films, as well as the Indiana Jones movies. In February 2018 it was announced Star Wars will no longer use the Wilhelm scream, with The Force Awakens (2015) being the last film in the series to use it. Other sound designers picked up on the effect, and inclusion of the sound in films became a tradition among the community of sound designers. A scene in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom features a man being eaten by a crocodile accompanied by the scream. Sound designer Gary Rydstrom included the effect for his 2006 directorial debut in Pixar's short, Lifted. Research by Burtt suggests that Sheb Wooley, best known for his novelty song \\"The Purple People Eater\\" in 1958 and as scout Pete Nolan on the television series Rawhide, is likely to have been the voice actor who originally performed the scream. This has been supported by an interview in 2005 with Linda Dotson, Wooley's widow. Burtt discovered records at Warner Brothers from the editor of Distant Drums including a short list of names of actors scheduled to record lines of dialogue for miscellaneous roles in the movie. Wooley played the uncredited role of Private Jessup in Distant Drums, and was one of the few actors assembled for the recording of additional vocal elements for the film. Wooley performed additional vocal elements, including the screams for a man being bitten by an alligator. Dotson confirmed Wooley's scream had been in many Westerns, adding, \\"He always used to joke about how he was so great about screaming and dying in films.\\" Despite the usage of the sound, no royalties are paid. Additionally, the sound can be heard in the video game Red Dead Redemption (2010) during gunfights. It is also featured in Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto IV (as an easter egg during the mission Final Interview), Grand Theft Auto V (also as an Easter egg in the mission Father/Son when a character is thrown from a boat that is on the back of a speeding truck) and in Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, when a random character kills himself. In Halo: Reach, the scream can be briefly heard after a trio of soldiers fail to land a jump in their Warthog during the beginning cutscene of the mission \\"Tip of The Spear.\\" In Borderlands 3 it can be rarely heard when hijacking a vehicle. Additionally, the scream can faintly be heard in a Halo 4 trailer. The sound was also heard in the movie Paul, which is an homage full of Easter egg references to many science fiction film franchises, including Star Wars, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Star Trek, Back to the Future, Alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Ice Age and more.

It was founded by Berry Gordy Jr. as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959, and incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960. Its name, a blend of motor and town, has become a nickname for Detroit, where the label was originally headquartered. Motown played an important role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved crossover success. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most successful proponents of the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. During the 1960s, Motown achieved 79 records in the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 between 1960 and 1969. Following the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967 and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland the same year over pay disputes, Gordy relocated Motown to Los Angeles, California. Motown expanded into film and television production, remaining an independent company until 1988, when it was sold to MCA Records. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group when it acquired PolyGram in 1999. Motown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H. Wright Museum. History=Beginnings of Motown= Berry Gordy's interest in the record business began when he opened a record store called the 3D Record Mart, a shop where he hoped to \\"educate customers about the beauty of jazz\\", in Detroit, Michigan. (The Gordys were an entrepreneurial family.) Although the shop did not last very long, Gordy's interest in the music business did not fade. He frequented Detroit's downtown nightclubs, and in the Flame Show Bar he met bar manager Al Green (not the famed singer), who owned a music publishing company called Pearl Music and represented Detroit-based musician Jackie Wilson. Gordy soon became part of a group of songwriters‚Äîwith his sister Gwen Gordy and Billy Davis‚Äîwho wrote songs for Wilson. \\"Reet Petite\\" was their first major hit which appeared in November 1957.Flory, p. 24. During the next eighteen months, Gordy helped to write six more Wilson A-sides, including \\"Lonely Teardrops\\", a peak-popular hit of 1958. Between 1957 and 1958, Gordy wrote or produced over a hundred sides for various artists, with his siblings Anna, Gwen and Robert, and other collaborators in varying combinations.Flory, p. 25. The Hitsville U.S.A. Motown building, at 2648 West Grand Boulevard in Detroit, Motown's headquarters from 1959 to 1968, which became the Motown Historical Museum in 1985 Smokey Robinson first met Gordy in 1957; he was little more than a local seventeen-year-old who fronted a vocal harmony group called the Matadors. At the time, Gordy was interested in the doo-wop style that Robinson sang. In 1958, Gordy released \\"Got a Job\\" (an answer song to \\"Get a Job\\" by the Silhouettes) for Robinson by leasing the record to a larger company outside Detroit called End Records, based in New York. The practice was common at the time for a small-time producer. \\"Got a Job\\" was the first single by Robinson's group, now called the Miracles. Gordy recorded a number of other records by forging a similar arrangement, most significantly with United Artists.Flory, p. 26. In 1958, Gordy wrote and produced \\"Come to Me\\" for Marv Johnson. Seeing that the song had great crossover potential, Gordy leased it to United Artists for national distribution but also released it locally on his own startup imprint. Needing $800 to cover his end of the deal, Gordy asked his family to borrow money from a cooperative family savings account. After some debate, his family agreed, and in January 1959 ‚ÄúCome to Me‚Äù was released regionally on Gordy's new Tamla label.Flory, p. 27. Gordy originally wanted to name the label Tammy Records, after the hit song popularized by Debbie Reynolds from the 1957 film Tammy and the Bachelor, in which Reynolds also starred. When he found the name was already in use, Berry decided on Tamla instead. In April 1959, Gordy and his sister Gwen founded Anna Records which released about two dozen singles between 1959 and 1960. The most popular was Barrett Strong's \\"Money (That's What I Want)\\", written by Gordy and a secretary named Janie Bradford, and produced by Gordy. Many of the songs distributed locally by Anna and Tamla Records were nationally distributed by Chess Records (sometimes with Anna and Tamla imprints). Gordy's relationship with Chess fostered closer dealings with Harvey Fuqua, nephew of Charlie Fuqua of the Ink Spots. Harvey Fuqua later married Gwen Gordy in 1961.Flory, p. 28. Gordy looked toward creative self- sufficiency and established publishing firm Jobete, incorporated to the state of Michigan in June 1959. He applied for copyrights on more than seventy songs before the end of 1959, including material used for the Miracles and Frances Burnett records that were leased to Chess and Coral Records. The Michigan Chronicle of Detroit called Gordy an \\"independent producer of records\\", as his contributions to the city were beginning to attract notice. By that time, he was the president of Jobete, Tamla, and Rayber, a music writing company.Flory, p. 29. Gordy worked in various Detroit-based studios during this period to produce recordings and demos, but most prominently with United Sound Systems which was considered the best studio in town. However, producing at United Sound Systems was financially taxing and not appropriate for every job, so Gordy decided it would be more cost effective to maintain his own facility. In mid-1959, he purchased a photography studio at 2648 West Grand Boulevard and converted the main floor into a recording studio and office space. Now, rather than shopping his songs to other artists or leasing his recordings to outside companies, Gordy began using the Tamla and Motown imprints to release songs that he wrote and produced. He incorporated Motown Records in April 1960.Flory, p. 31. Smokey Robinson became the vice president of the company (and later named his daughter \\"Tamla\\" and his son \\"Berry\\"). Several of Gordy's family members, including his father Berry Sr., brothers Robert and George, and sister Esther, were given key roles in the company. By the middle of the decade, Gwen and Anna Gordy had joined the label in administrative positions as well. Gordy's partner at the time (and wife from 1960‚Äì64), Raynoma Liles, also played a key role in the early days of Motown, leading the company's first session group, The Rayber Voices, and overseeing Jobete. =West Grand Boulevard= Also in 1959, Gordy purchased the property that would become Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. studio. The photography studio located in the back of the property was modified into a small recording studio, and the Gordys moved into the second-floor living quarters. Within seven years, Motown would occupy seven additional neighboring houses: *Hitsville U.S.A., 1959 ‚Äì (ground floor) administrative office, tape library, control room, Studio A; (upper floor) Gordy living quarters (1959‚Äì62), artists and repertoire (1962‚Äì72) *Jobete Publishing office, 1961 ‚Äì sales, billing, collections, shipping, and public relations *Berry Gordy Jr. Enterprise, 1962 ‚Äì offices for Berry Gordy Jr. and Esther Gordy Edwards *Finance department, 1965 ‚Äì royalties and payroll *Artist personal development, 1966 ‚Äì Harvey Fuqua (head of artist development and producer of stage performances), Maxine Powell (instructor in grooming, poise, and social graces for Motown artists), Maurice King (vocal coach, musical director and arranger), Cholly Atkins (house choreography), and rehearsal studios *Two houses for administrative offices, 1966 ‚Äì sales and marketing, traveling and traffic, and mixing and mastering *ITMI (International Talent Management Inc.) office, 1966 ‚Äì management Motown had hired over 450 employees and had a gross income of $20 million by the end of 1966. =Detroit: 1959‚Äì1972= Early Tamla/Motown artists included Mable John, Eddie Holland and Mary Wells. \\"Shop Around\\", the Miracles' first number 1 R&B; hit, peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1960. It was Tamla's first million-selling record. On April 14, 1960, Motown and Tamla Records merged into a new company called Motown Record Corporation. A year later, the Marvelettes scored Tamla's first US number-one pop hit, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\". By the mid-1960s, the company, with the help of songwriters and producers such as Robinson, A&R; chief William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, and Norman Whitfield, had become a major force in the music industry. From 1961 to 1971, Motown had 110 top 10 hits. Top artists on the Motown label during that period included the Supremes (initially including Diana Ross), the Four Tops, and the Jackson 5, while Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Marvelettes, and the Miracles had hits on the Tamla label. The company operated several labels in addition to the Tamla and Motown imprints. A third label, which Gordy named after himself (though it was originally called \\"Miracle\\") featured the Temptations, the Contours, Edwin Starr, and Martha and the Vandellas. A fourth, V.I.P., released recordings by the Velvelettes, the Spinners, the Monitors, and Chris Clark. A fifth label, Soul, featured Jr. Walker & the All Stars, Jimmy Ruffin, Shorty Long, the Originals, and Gladys Knight & the Pips (who had found success before joining Motown, as \\"The Pips\\" on Vee-Jay). Many more Motown-owned labels released recordings in other genres, including Workshop Jazz (jazz) Earl Washington Reflections and Earl Washington's All Stars, Mel-o-dy (country, although it was originally an R&B; label), and Rare Earth, which featured the band Rare Earth themselves. Under the slogan \\"The Sound of Young America\\", Motown's acts were enjoying widespread popularity among black and white audiences alike. Smokey Robinson said of Motown's cultural impact: > Into the 1960s, I was still not of a frame of mind that we were not only > making music, we were making history. But I did recognize the impact because > acts were going all over the world at that time. I recognized the bridges > that we crossed, the racial problems and the barriers that we broke down > with music. I recognized that because I lived it. I would come to the South > in the early days of Motown and the audiences would be segregated. Then they > started to get the Motown music and we would go back and the audiences were > integrated and the kids were dancing together and holding hands.Ron > Thibodeaux, \\"My Smokey Valentine\\", The Times-Picayune (New Orleans, La.), > February 14, 2009. Berry Gordy House, known as Motown Mansion in Detroit's Boston-Edison Historic District In 1967 Berry Gordy purchased what is now known as Motown Mansion in Detroit's Boston-Edison Historic District as his home, leaving his previous home to his sister Anna and then-husband Marvin Gaye (where photos for the cover of his album What's Going On were taken). In 1968, Gordy purchased the Donovan building on the corner of Woodward Avenue and Interstate 75, and moved Motown's Detroit offices there (the Donovan building was demolished in January 2006 to provide parking spaces for Super Bowl XL). In the same year Gordy purchased Golden World Records, and its recording studio became \\"Studio B\\" to Hitsville's \\"Studio A\\". In the United Kingdom, Motown's records were released on various labels: at first London (only the Miracles' \\"Shop Around\\"/\\"Who's Lovin' You\\" and \\"Ain't It Baby\\"), then Fontana (\\"Please Mr. Postman\\" by the Marvelettes was one of four) and then Oriole American (\\"Fingertips\\" by Little Stevie Wonder was one of many). In 1963, Motown signed with EMI's Stateside label (\\"Where Did Our Love Go\\" by the Supremes and \\"My Guy\\" by Mary Wells were Motown's first British top-20 hits). Eventually EMI created the Tamla Motown label (\\"Stop! In the Name of Love\\" by the Supremes was the first Tamla Motown release in March 1965). =Los Angeles: 1972‚Äì1998= After the songwriting trio Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland left the label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, Norman Whitfield became the company's top producer, turning out hits for The Temptations, Marvin Gaye, Gladys Knight & the Pips and Rare Earth. In the meantime Berry Gordy established Motown Productions, a television subsidiary which produced TV specials for the Motown artists, including TCB, with Diana Ross & the Supremes and the Temptations, Diana! with Diana Ross, and Goin' Back to Indiana with the Jackson 5. The company loosened its production rules, allowing some of its longtime artists the opportunity to write and produce more of their own material. This resulted in the recordings of successful and critically acclaimed albums such as Marvin Gaye's What's Going On (1971) and Let's Get it On (1973), and Stevie Wonder's Music of My Mind (1972), Talking Book (1972), and Innervisions (1973). Motown had established branch offices in both New York City and Los Angeles during the mid-1960s, and by 1969 had begun gradually moving more of its operations to Los Angeles. The company moved all of its operations to Los Angeles in June 1972, with a number of artists, among them Martha Reeves, the Four Tops, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and many of the Funk Brothers studio band, either staying behind in Detroit or leaving the company for other reasons. By re- locating, Motown aimed chiefly to branch out into the motion-picture industry, and Motown Productions got its start in film by turning out two hit-vehicles for Diana Ross: the Billie Holiday biographical film Lady Sings the Blues (1972), and Mahogany (1975). Other Motown films would include Scott Joplin (1977), Thank God It's Friday (1978), The Wiz (1978) and The Last Dragon (1985). Ewart Abner, who had been associated with Motown since the 1960s, became its president in 1973. By the 1970s, the Motown \\"hit factory\\" had become a target of a backlash from some fans of rock music. Record producer Pete Waterman recalls of this period: \\"I was a DJ for years and I worked for Motown ‚Äì the press at the time, papers like NME, used to call it Toytown. When I DJ'd on the Poly circuit, the students wanted me to play Spooky Tooth and Velvet Underground. Things don't change. Nowadays, of course, Motown is hip.\\" Despite losing Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland, Norman Whitfield, and some of its other hitmakers by 1975, Motown still had a number of successful artists during the 1970s and 1980s, including Lionel Richie and the Commodores, Rick James, Teena Marie, the Dazz Band, Jose Feliciano and DeBarge. By the mid-1980s Motown had started losing money, and Berry Gordy sold his ownership in Motown to MCA Records (which began a US distribution deal with the label in 1983) and Boston Ventures in June 1988 for $61 million. In 1989, Gordy sold the Motown Productions TV/film operations to Motown executive Suzanne de Passe, who renamed the company de Passe Entertainment and continues to run it . During the 1990s, Motown was home to successful recording artists such as Boyz II Men and Johnny Gill, although the company itself remained in a state of turmoil. MCA appointed a series of executives to run the company, beginning with Berry Gordy's immediate successor, Jheryl Busby. Busby quarreled with MCA, alleging that the company did not give Motown's product adequate attention or promotion. In 1991, Motown sued MCA to have its distribution deal with the company terminated, and began releasing its product through PolyGram. PolyGram purchased Motown from Boston Ventures three years later. In 1994, Busby was replaced by Andre Harrell, the entrepreneur behind Uptown Records. Harrell served as Motown's CEO for just under two years, leaving the company after receiving bad publicity for being inefficient. Danny Goldberg, who ran PolyGram's Mercury Records group, assumed control of Motown, and George Jackson served as president. =Final years of the Motown label: 1999‚Äì2005= By 1998, Motown had added stars such as 702, Brian McKnight, and Erykah Badu to its roster. In December 1998, PolyGram was acquired by Seagram, and Motown was absorbed into the Universal Music Group. Seagram had purchased Motown's former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram). Universal briefly considered shuttering the label, but instead decided to restructure it. Kedar Massenburg, a producer for Erykah Badu, became the head of the label, and oversaw successful recordings from Badu, McKnight, Michael McDonald, and new Motown artist India.Arie. Diana Ross, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, and the Temptations had remained with the label since its early days, although all except Wonder recorded for other labels for several years. Ross left Motown for RCA Records from 1981 to 1988, but returned in 1989 and stayed until 2002, while Robinson left Motown in 1991 (although he did return to release one more album for the label in 1999). The Temptations left for Atlantic Records in 1977, but returned in 1980 and eventually left again in 2004. , Wonder is the only artist from Motown's early period still on the label. =Universal Motown: 2005‚Äì2011= In 2005, Massenburg was replaced by Sylvia Rhone, former CEO of Elektra Records. Motown was merged with Universal Records to create the Universal Motown Records and placed under the newly created umbrella division of Universal Motown Republic Group. Notable artists on Universal Motown included Drake Bell, Ryan Leslie, Melanie Fiona, Kelly Rowland, Forever the Sickest Kids, The Veer Union and Four Year Strong. Motown celebrated its 50th anniversary on January 12, 2009. =Relaunch: 2011‚Äìpresent= In the Summer of 2011, Universal Motown reverted to the Motown brand after having been separated from Universal Motown Republic Group, hired Ethiopia Habtemariam as its Senior Vice President, and operated under The Island Def Jam Music Group. Artists from Universal Motown were transferred to the newly revitalized Motown label. On January 25, 2012, it was announced that Ne-Yo would join the Motown label both as an artist as well as the new Senior Vice President of A&R.; On April 1, 2014, it was announced that Island Def Jam will no longer be running following the resignation of CEO Barry Weiss. In a press release sent out by Universal Music Group, the label will now be reorganizing Def Jam Recordings, Island Records and Motown Records all as separate entities. Motown would then begin serving as a subsidiary of Capitol Records. In late 2018, Motown began celebrating its 60th anniversary by reissuing numerous albums from their catalog. Motown UK launched in September 2020 under Universal UK's EMI Records (formerly Virgin EMI Records) division. Motown Sound Motown specialized in a type of soul music it referred to with the trademark \\"The Motown Sound\\". Crafted with an ear towards pop appeal, the Motown Sound typically used tambourines to accent the back beat, prominent and often melodic electric bass-guitar lines, distinctive melodic and chord structures, and a call-and- response singing style that originated in gospel music. In 1971, Jon Landau wrote in Rolling Stone that the sound consisted of songs with simple structures but sophisticated melodies, along with a four-beat drum pattern, regular use of horns and strings, and \\"a trebly style of mixing that relied heavily on electronic limiting and equalizing (boosting the high range frequencies) to give the overall product a distinctive sound, particularly effective for broadcast over AM radio\\". Pop production techniques such as the use of orchestral string sections, charted horn sections, and carefully arranged background vocals were also used. Complex arrangements and elaborate, melismatic vocal riffs were avoided.Chin, Brian & David Nathan, \\"Reflections Of...\\" The Supremes [CD boxed-set liner notes] (New York: Motown Record Co./Universal Music, 2000). Motown producers believed steadfastly in the \\"KISS principle\\" (keep it simple, stupid).Williams, Otis & Patricia Romanowski, Temptations (Lanham, MD: Cooper Square, 1988; updated 2002). , p. 157. The Motown production process has been described as factory-like. The Hitsville studios remained open and active 22 hours a day, and artists would often go on tour for weeks, come back to Detroit to record as many songs as possible, and then promptly go on tour again. Berry Gordy held quality control meetings every Friday morning, and used veto power to ensure that only the very best material and performances would be released. The test was that every new release needed to fit into a sequence of the top five selling pop singles of the week. Several tracks that later became critical and commercial favorites were initially rejected by Gordy; the two most notable being the Marvin Gaye songs \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and \\"What's Going On\\". In several cases, producers would re-work tracks in hopes of eventually getting them approved at a later Friday morning meeting, as producer Norman Whitfield did with \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" and The Temptations' \\"Ain't Too Proud to Beg\\". Many of Motown's best-known songs, including all the early hits for the Supremes, were written by the songwriting trio of Holland‚ÄìDozier‚ÄìHolland (Lamont Dozier and brothers Brian and Eddie Holland). Other important Motown producers and songwriters included Norman Whitfield, William \\"Mickey\\" Stevenson, Smokey Robinson, Barrett Strong, Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson, Frank Wilson, Pamela Sawyer & Gloria Jones, James Dean & William Weatherspoon, Johnny Bristol, Harvey Fuqua, Gil Askey, Stevie Wonder, and Gordy himself. The style created by the Motown musicians was a major influence on several non-Motown artists of the mid-1960s, such as Dusty Springfield and the Foundations. In the United Kingdom, the Motown Sound became the basis of the northern soul movement. Smokey Robinson said the Motown Sound had little to do with Detroit: =The Funk Brothers= In addition to the songwriting process of the writers and producers, one of the major factors in the widespread appeal of Motown's music was Gordy's practice of using a highly- select and tight-knit group of studio musicians, collectively known as the Funk Brothers, to record the instrumental or \\"band\\" tracks of a majority of Motown recordings. Among the studio musicians responsible for the \\"Motown Sound\\" were keyboardists Earl Van Dyke, Johnny Griffith, and Joe Hunter; guitarists Joe Messina, Robert White, and Eddie Willis; percussionists Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown and Jack Ashford; drummers Benny Benjamin, Uriel Jones, and Richard \\"Pistol\\" Allen; and bassists James Jamerson and Bob Babbitt. The band's career and work is chronicled in the 2002 documentary film Standing in the Shadows of Motown, which publicised the fact that these musicians \\"played on more number-one records than The Beatles, Elvis, The Rolling Stones, and The Beach Boys combined.\\" Ashford later played on Raphael Saadiq's 2008 album The Way I See It, whose recording and production were modelled after the Motown Sound. Much of the Motown Sound came from the use of overdubbed and duplicated instrumentation. Motown songs regularly featured two drummers instead of one (either overdubbed or in unison), as well as three or four guitar lines. Bassist James Jamerson often played his instrument with only the index finger of his right hand, and created many of the basslines apparent on Motown songs such as \\"Up the Ladder to the Roof\\" by The Supremes. Artist development Artist development was a major part of Motown's operations instituted by Berry Gordy. The acts on the Motown label were fastidiously groomed, dressed and choreographed for live performances. Motown artists were advised that their breakthrough into the white popular music market made them ambassadors for other African-American artists seeking broad market acceptance, and that they should think, act, walk and talk like royalty, so as to alter the less-than-dignified image commonly held of black musicians by white Americans in that era.Pitts, Leonard, Jr. ‚ÄúThe Motown Factor‚Äù. Jazziz. Issue 20.12. Dec. 2003. 60-62. Print. Given that many of the talented young artists had been raised in housing projects and lacked the necessary social and dress experience, this Motown department was not only necessary, it created an elegant style of presentation long associated with the label. The artist development department specialized primarily in working with younger, less-experienced acts; experienced performers such as Jr. Walker and Marvin Gaye were exempt from artist-development classes. Many of the young artists participated in an annual package tour called the \\"Motortown Revue\\", which was popular, first, on the \\"Chitlin' Circuit\\", and, later, around the world. The tours gave the younger artists a chance to hone their performance and social skills and learn from the more experienced artists. Motown subsidiary labels In order to avoid accusations of payola should DJs play too many records from the original Tamla label, Gordy formed Motown Records as a second label in 1960. The two labels featured the same writers, producers and artists. Many more subsidiary labels were established later under the umbrella of the Motown parent company, including Gordy Records, Soul Records and VIP Records; in reality the Motown Record Corporation controlled all of these labels. Most of the distinctions between Motown labels were largely arbitrary, with the same writers, producers and musicians working on all the major subsidiaries, and artists were often shuffled between labels for internal marketing reasons. All of these records are usually considered to be \\"Motown\\" records, regardless of whether they actually appeared on the Motown Records label itself. =Major divisions= * Tamla Records: Established 1959, Tamla was a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&B;/soul music. Tamla is the company's original label: Gordy founded Tamla Records several months before establishing the Motown Record Corporation. The label's numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Gordy in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Tamla artists included Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, and the Marvelettes. Tamla was briefly re- activated in 1996 as a reggae label, but only released a 12\\" single by Cocoa Tea called \\"New Immigration Law\\". Tamla also had a sub-label called Penny Records in 1959; artists on that label included Bryan Brent And The Cut Outs, who recorded a single for the label entitled \\"Vacation Time\\" b/w \\"For Eternity\\" (2201). Tamla Records slogan: \\"The Sound that Makes the World Go 'Round\\". * Motown Records: Established 1960, Motown was and remains the company's main label for mainstream R&B;/soul music (and, today, hip-hop music as well). The label's numbering system was combined with those of Tamla and Gordy in 1982, and the label (and company) was purchased by MCA in 1988. Notable Motown artists have included Mary Wells, the Supremes, Four Tops, the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, Jermaine Jackson, Boyz II Men, Commodores, Lionel Richie, Dazz Band, Brian McKnight, 98 Degrees, and Erykah Badu. Motown Records slogan: \\"The Sound of Young America\\". * Gordy Records: Established 1962, Gordy was also a primary subsidiary for mainstream R&B;/soul music. Originally known as Miracle Records (slogan: \\"If It's a Hit, It's a Miracle\\"), the name was changed in 1962 to avoid confusion with the Miracles singing group. The label's numbering system was combined with those of Motown and Tamla in 1982, and the label was merged with Motown in 1988. Notable Gordy artists included the Temptations, Martha and the Vandellas, the Contours, Edwin Starr, Rick James, The Mary Jane Girls, Teena Marie, Switch, and DeBarge. Gordy Records slogan: \\"It's What's in the Grooves that Counts\\". * Tamla Motown Records: Motown's non-US label, established in March 1965 and folded into the regular Motown label in 1976. Distributed by EMI, Tamla Motown issued the releases on the American Motown labels, using its own numbering system. In some cases, Tamla Motown would issue singles and albums not released in the United States (for example, the singles \\"I Second That Emotion\\" and \\"Why (Must We Fall in Love)\\" by Diana Ross & the Supremes with the Temptations, as well as the successful Motown Chartbusters series of albums). =Secondary R&B; labels= * Check-Mate Records: Short-lived (1961‚Äì1962) R&B;/soul subsidiary, purchased from Chess Records. Notable artists included David Ruffin and The Del-Phis (later Martha and the Vandellas). * Miracle Records: Short-lived (1961) R&B;/soul subsidiary that lasted less than a year. Some pressings featured the infamous tagline, \\"If it's a hit, it's a Miracle.\\" Renamed Gordy Records in 1962. Notable releases included early recordings by Jimmy Ruffin and the Temptations. * MoWest Records: MoWest was a short-lived (1971‚Äì1973; 1976 in UK) subsidiary for R&B;/soul artists based on the West Coast. Shut down when the main Motown office moved to Los Angeles. Notable artists included G. C. Cameron, the Sisters Love, Syreeta Wright, the Four Seasons, Commodores (their first two singles in 1972 and 1973), and Los Angeles DJ Tom Clay. Unlike other Motown releases in the UK that were released by Tamla Motown, MoWest retained its US label design and logo for its UK releases as well. In fact, MoWest lasted longer in the UK up until 1976. * Motown Yesteryear: a label created in late 1970s and used through the 1980s for the reissues of 7-inch singles from all eras of the company's history, after printing in the initial label has ceased. One Motown Yesteryear single made Billboard‚Ä≤s Top 40 ‚Äì the Contours' \\"Do You Love Me\\", in 1988, when its inclusion in the film Dirty Dancing revived interest. * Soul Records: Established in 1964, Soul was a R&B;/soul subsidiary for releases with less of a jazz feel and/or more of a blues feel. Notable Soul artists included Jr. Walker & the All-Stars, Shorty Long, Gladys Knight & the Pips, the Originals, the Fantastic Four, and Jimmy Ruffin. The label was dissolved in 1978. This label has no affiliation with the short- lived S.O.U.L. Records- an early 1990s imprint that was founded by the production team the Bomb Squad. * V.I.P. Records: Established in 1964, V.I.P. was an R&B;/soul subsidiary. Notable artists included the Velvelettes, the Spinners, the Monitors, the Elgins and Chris Clark. V.I.P. also was the outlet for pop records that were leased to Motown by EMI (the distributor of Tamla- Motown in Europe). The label was dissolved in 1974. * Weed Records: A very short-lived subsidiary. Only one release, Chris Clark's 1969 CC Rides Again album, was issued. This release featured the tongue-in-cheek tagline: \\"Your Favorite Artists Are On Weed\\". The logo was a parody of the \\"Snapping Fingers\\" logo for Stax Records, but the hand in this case is holding up a peace sign. The name \\"Weed Records\\" is now owned by the Tokyo/New York-based Weed Records. =Additional genre labels=Country * Mel-o-dy Records.: Established in 1962 as a secondary R&B;/soul music subsidiary, Mel-o-dy later focused on white country music artists. Notable Mel-o-dy artists include Dorsey Burnette. The label was dissolved in 1965. * Hitsville Records.: Founded as Melodyland Records in 1974. After the Melodyland Christian Center threatened legal action, the name was changed to Hitsville in 1976. Like Mel-o-dy before it, Hitsville focused on country music. Run by Mike Curb and Ray Ruff, Hitsville's notable artists included Ronnie Dove, Pat Boone, T. G. Sheppard and Jud Strunk. The label was dissolved in 1977. In the UK, Melodyland/Hitsville material was released on MoWest. * M.C. Records: Operated 1977 to 1978 as a continuation of the Hitsville label. A joint venture between Gordy and Mike Curb. The Mel-o-dy, Hitsville, and M.C. catalogs are now managed by Mercury Nashville Records. Hip hop/rap * Wondirection Records.: A record label owned by Stevie Wonder, it had one 12-inch dance release, the 10' 35\\" rap track \\"The Crown\\" by Gary Byrd and the G.B. Experience. * Mad Sounds Recordings.: Short-lived hip-hop/rap subsidiary label, released five albums in the mid-1990s- including Zig Zag by Tha Mexakinz, Trendz by Trendz of Culture and Rottin ta da Core by Rottin Razkals. Jazz * Workshop Jazz Records.: Motown's jazz subsidiary, active from 1962 to 1964. Notable Workshop Jazz artists included the George Bohannon Trio, Earl Washington All Stars, and Four Tops (whose recordings for the label went unissued for 30 years). The Workshop Jazz catalog is currently managed by Verve Records. * Blaze Records.: A short-lived label featuring a Jack Ashford instrumental released in September 1969, \\"Do The Choo-Choo\\" with b-side \\"Do The Choo-Choo Pt II\\" written by L. Chandler, E. Willis, J. Ashford, with label number 1107. * Mo Jazz Records.: Another jazz label created in the 1990s, this was Motown's most successful jazz imprint. Notable artists included Norman Brown, Foley, Norman Connors, and J. Spencer. It also reissued instrumental albums like Stevie Wonder's 1968 album Eivets Rednow and Grover Washington Jr.'s CTI/Kudu albums under the Classic Mo Jazz subsidiary. This label (including its roster and catalog) was folded into Verve Records after the PolyGram/Universal merger. Rock * Rare Earth Records.: Established in 1969 after the signing of Rare Earth (after whom the label was named), Rare Earth Records was a subsidiary focusing on rock music by white artists. Notable acts included Rare Earth, R. Dean Taylor, the Pretty Things, Love Sculpture, Kiki Dee, Toe Fat, The Cats and Shaun Murphy (both solo and her collaborations with Meat Loaf). The label also was the subsidiary to house the first white band signed to Motown, the Rustix. * Prodigal Records.: Purchased by Motown in 1976, Motown used Prodigal Records as a second rock music subsidiary; a successor label to Rare Earth Records. The Rare Earth band moved over to the label following the Rare Earth label's demise. Pop singer Charlene's #3 pop single for Motown I've Never Been To Me was originally released and charted on this label in 1977 (#97). Prodigal was dissolved in 1978. * Morocco Records.: Acronym for \\"MOtown ROCk COmpany\\". As the name suggests, Morocco was a rock music subsidiary. Active from 1983 to 1984, it was a short-lived attempt to revive the Rare Earth Records concept. Only seven albums were released on the label. Its two most promising acts, Duke Jupiter and the black new wave trio Tiggi Clay (via their lead singer, Fizzy Qwick) eventually moved to the parent label. Other * Divinity Records.: Short-lived (1962‚Äì1963) gospel subsidiary. With five releases by artists- Wright Specials, Gospel Stars, Bernadettes, and Liz Lands. Label sequence starts at 99004 to 99008, the final recording being \\"We Shall Overcome\\" (for label number 99008) that was recorded in the Graystone Ballroom, was withdrawn and transferred to GORDY 7023B as the \\"I Have A Dream\\" speech by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. * Black Forum Records.: Short-lived (1970‚Äì1973) spoken-word subsidiary that focused mainly on albums featuring progressive political and pro-civil rights speeches/poetry. Black Forum issued recordings by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael, Elaine Brown, Langston Hughes, Margaret Danner, and others.Rickey Vincent, \\"Louder Than a Bomb: On The Sounds of Black Power\\" (review of Pat Thomas, Listen, Whitey!: the Sights and Sounds of Black Power 1965-1975) , Los Angeles Review of Books, October 17, 2012. * Natural Resources: This label was active from 1972 to 1973 and in 1976 as a minor subsidiary for white artists and instrumental bands. It later served as a label for Motown, Tamla and Gordy reissues and Motown compilation albums in 1978 and 1979. * Motown Latino Records.: Short-lived (1982) subsidiary for Spanish-language Latin American music. Its only artist was Jose Feliciano. * Gaiee Records.: Only one single was released on this label, in 1975; Valentino's \\"Gay/Lesbian\\" anthem \\"I Was Born This Way\\", which was later covered by fellow Motown artist Carl Bean in 1977. =Independent labels distributed by Motown= * Biv 10 Records: A hip-hop/R&B; label that was founded by Bell Biv Devoe/New Edition member Michael Bivins. The label operated throughout most of the 1990s.

Manticore released albums by ELP and various other Progressive rock artists. Manticore was originally distributed in the U.S. by Atlantic Records from 1973 to 1975 but switched to Motown distribution until the label folded in 1977. =Miscellaneous labels associated with Motown= * Groovesville Records * Inferno Records * IPG Records * Rayber Records * Ric-Tic Records * Rich Records * Summer Camp Records * Tabu Records British (pre-Tamla Motown) labels * London American Records issued the releases for Motown from 1960 to 1961. * Fontana Records issued the releases for Motown from 1961 to 1962. * Oriole American Records issued the releases for Motown from 1962 to 1963. * Stateside Records issued the releases for Motown from 1963 to 1965, when the Tamla Motown label was created.

The message was approved by D√°il √âireann on 21 January 1919. It asked nations to recognise Ireland as a separate nation, free from British rule. It was adopted in three languages: Irish, English and French. Little attention was paid to it by the free nations as World War I was ending. An Armistice had been signed, but the war technically ended with the Treaty of Versailles which was signed in June 1919. Britain assured its fellow-victors that the situation in Ireland would be dealt with under the new principles of self-determination, and so significant Irish support in America was negated by President Wilson who would not recognise the sovereignty of the Irish Republic. The British solution was enacted in 1920 as the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The Irish Republic was not recognised by any other state. The text of the Message to the Free Nations of the World (English) To the Nations of the World‚ÄîGreeting The Nation of Ireland having proclaimed her national independence, calls, through her elected representatives in Parliament assembled in the Irish Capital on January 21, 1919, upon every free nation to support the Irish Republic by recognising Ireland's national status and her right to its vindication at the Peace Congress. Naturally, the race, the language, the customs and traditions of Ireland are radically distinct from the English. Ireland is one of the most ancient nations in Europe, and she has preserved her national integrity, vigorous and intact, through seven centuries of foreign oppression; she has never relinquished her national rights, and throughout the long era of English usurpation she has in every generation defiantly proclaimed her inalienable right of nationhood down to her last glorious resort to arms in 1916. Internationally, Ireland is the gateway to the Atlantic; Ireland is the last outpost of Europe towards the West; Ireland is the point upon which great trade routes between East and West converge; her independence is demanded by the Freedom of the Seas; her great harbours must be open to all nations, instead of being the monopoly of England. To-day these harbours are empty and idle solely because English policy is determined to retain Ireland as a barren bulwark for English aggrandisement, and the unique geographical position of this island, far from being a benefit and safeguard to Europe and America, is subjected to the purposes of England's policy of world domination. Ireland to-day reasserts her historic nationhood the more confidently before the new world emerging from the war, because she believes in freedom and justice as the fundamental principles of international law; because she believes in a frank co-operation between the peoples for equal rights against the vested privileges of ancient tyrannies; because the permanent peace of Europe can never be secured by perpetuating military dominion for the profit of empire but only by establishing the control of government in every land upon the basis of the free will of a free people, and the existing state of war, between Ireland and England, can never be ended until Ireland is definitely evacuated by the armed forces of England. For these among other reasons, Ireland‚Äîresolutely and irrevocably determined at the dawn of the promised era of self-determination and liberty that she will suffer foreign dominion no longer‚Äîcalls upon every free nation to uphold her national claim to complete independence as an Irish Republic against the arrogant pretensions of England founded in fraud and sustained only by an overwhelming military occupation, and demands to be confronted publicly with England at the Congress of the Nations, that the civilised world having judged between English wrong and Irish right may guarantee to Ireland its permanent support for the maintenance of her national independence.

The trail's southern terminus is just south of Campo, California by the U.S. border with Mexico, and its northern terminus is on the Canada‚ÄìUS border on the edge of Manning Park in British Columbia; it passes through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington. The Pacific Crest Trail is long and ranges in elevation from just above sea level at the Oregon‚ÄìWashington border to at Forester Pass in the Sierra Nevada. The route passes through 25 national forests and 7 national parks.\\"Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail.\\" Parks Directory of the United States. 2004 ed. Its midpoint is near Chester, California (near Mt. Lassen), where the Sierra and Cascade mountain ranges meet. It was designated a National Scenic Trail in 1968, although it was not officially completed until 1993. The PCT was conceived by Clinton Churchill Clarke in 1932. It received official status under the National Trails System Act of 1968. The Pacific Crest Trail, the Appalachian Trail, and the Continental Divide Trail form what is known as the Triple Crown of Hiking in the United States. The Pacific Crest Trail is also part of the 6,875-mile Great Western Loop. Route The route is mostly through National Forest and protected wilderness. The trail avoids civilization and covers scenic and pristine mountainous terrain with few roads. It passes through the Laguna, Santa Rosa, San Jacinto, San Bernardino, San Gabriel, Liebre, Tehachapi, Sierra Nevada, and Klamath ranges in California, and the Cascade Range in California, Oregon, and Washington. PCT overview from Forest Service brochure A parallel route for bicycles, the Pacific Crest Bicycle Trail (PCBT) is a route designed closely parallel to the PCT on roads. The PCT and PCBT cross in about 27 places along their routes. History The Pacific Crest Trail was first proposed around 1932 by Clinton C. Clarke as a trail running from Mexico to Canada along the crest of the mountains in California, Oregon, and Washington. The original proposal was to link the John Muir Trail, the Tahoe‚ÄìYosemite Trail (both in California), the Skyline Trail (in Oregon) and the Cascade Crest Trail (in Washington). The Pacific Crest Trail System Conference was formed by Clarke to both plan the trail and to lobby the federal government to protect the trail. The conference was founded by Clarke, the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, and Ansel Adams (amongst others). From 1935 through 1938, YMCA groups explored the 2,000 miles of potential trail and planned a route, which has been closely followed by the modern PCT route. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson defined the PCT and the Appalachian Trail with the National Trails System Act. The PCT was then constructed through cooperation between the federal government and volunteers organized by the Pacific Crest Trail Association. In 1993, the PCT was officially declared finished. The Trust for Public Land has purchased and conserved more than along the Pacific Crest Trail in Washington. Consolidation of this land has allowed for better recreational access as well as greater ease to manage conservation lands. Thru hiking Thru hiking is a term used in referring to hikers who complete long-distance trails from end to end in a single trip. Thru-hiking is a long commitment, usually taking between four and six months, that requires thorough preparation and dedication. The Pacific Crest Trail Association estimates that it takes most hikers between six and eight months to plan their trip. While most hikers travel from the southern terminus at the Mexico‚ÄìUS border northward to Manning Park, British Columbia, some hikers prefer a southbound route. In a normal weather year, northbound hikes are most practical due to snow and temperature considerations. Additionally, some hiker services are seasonal and may be better timed for northbound hikers. If snowpack in the Sierra Nevada is high in early June and low in the Northern Cascades, some hikers may choose to 'flip-flop.' Flip- flopping can take many forms but often describes a process whereby a hiker begins at one end (on the PCT, usually the southern end) of the trail and then, at some point, like reaching the Sierra, 'flips' to the end of the trail at the Canada‚ÄìUS border and hikes southbound to complete the trail. However, it is not currently possible to legally enter the United States from Canada by using the Pacific Crest Trail. Hikers also have to determine their resupply points. Resupply points are towns or post offices where hikers replenish food and other supplies such as cooking fuel. Hikers can ship packages to themselves at the U.S. Post Offices along the trail, resupply at general and grocery stores along the trail, or any combination of the two. The final major logistical step is to create an approximate schedule for completion. Thru hikers have to make sure they complete enough miles every day to reach the opposite end of the trail before weather conditions make sections impassable. For northbound thru-hikers, deep snow pack in the Sierra Nevada can prevent an early start. The timing is a balance between not getting to the Sierra too soon nor the Northern Cascades too late. Most hikers cover about 20 miles (32 km) per day. In order to reduce their hiking time and thereby increase their chances of completing the trail, many hikers try to substantially reduce their pack weight. Since the creation of the Pacific Crest Trail there has been a large movement by hikers to get away from large heavy packs with a lot of gear. There are three general classifications for hikers: Traditional, Lightweight, and Ultralight. Notable hikers Before the PCT became an official trail, Martin Papendick was the first known person to hike across three states of the PCT in 1952. After being one of the first to finish the Appalachian trail in 1951, Papendick hiked between July 4 and December 1, 1952, from British Columbia to the Mexico‚ÄìUS border over the crests of the mountains along the Pacific Coast, a feat he reported in a periodical under the title \\"Pacific Crest Trails\\". On October 16, 1970, Eric Ryback, an 18-year-old student, completed the first PCT thru-hike. His personal congratulations came by telegram from Edward P. Cliff, Chief of the U.S. Forest Service. Ryback is credited, recognized, and has been honored by the Pacific Crest Trail Association as the official first thru-hiker of the entire trail. Ryback completed the Appalachian Trail in 1969 (as a 16-year-old); the Pacific Crest Trail in 1970; and a route approximating today's Continental Divide Trail in 1972. Ryback's 1971 book The High Adventure of Eric Ryback: Canada to Mexico on Foot focused public attention on the PCT. Ryback carried an 80-pound pack on his 1970 thru-hike. He had only five resupply packages on the entire trip and was loaded with 40 pounds of food at the start of each leg. He often ran out of food and foraged or went hungry. Ryback also helped the Forest Service lay out future plans for the PCT. However, Ryback's claim is disputed. When the guidebook publisher, Wilderness Press, stated that Ryback had used motor transport in places along the PCT, Ryback sued for $3 million but withdrew the suit after Wilderness Press revealed statements from the people who claim to have picked up the young hiker along highways parallel to the 2,600-mile trail. Ryback is in Smithsonian's top 9 list of people Cheating Their Way to Fame though it notes that \\"the claims that Ryback 'cheated' are still doubted by some.\\" The first person to hike the PCT from south to north was Richard Watson, who completed the trail on September 1, 1972. Watson was often credited as the first PCT thru-hiker, because Papendick was generally unknown and Ryback may have accepted rides. The first woman to complete the PCT was Mary Carstens, who finished the journey later in 1972, accompanied by Jeff Smukler. The first person to thru-hike the entire PCT both ways in a single continuous round-trip was Scott Williamson, who completed the \\"yo-yo\\" circuit on his fourth attempt in November 2004. Williamson traveled a total of in 197 days, covering an average of per day when not in snow ‚Äì an overall average of per day ‚Äì wearing an extremely ultra-lightweight pack, which \\"without food, weighed about \\". Williamson then went on to complete a second round trip on November 28, 2006, cutting two weeks off his 2004 time. In 2014, Olive McGloin (from Ireland) became the first woman to thru-hike the PCT both ways in a single continuous round-trip. The youngest person to hike the trail is Christian Thomas Geiger, who at the age of 6 completed the trail with his parents Andrea Rego and Dion Pagonis. Christian, also known by his trail name Buddy Backpacker, is also the youngest person to hike the Appalachian Trail Other notable young hikers include Sierra Burror and Reed Gjonnes. Sierra Burror, who completed a continuous thru-hike of the trail in 2012 at the age of 9, is the youngest girl to thru-hike the trail. She completed her hike with her mother, Heather Burror.Burror, Heather (March 29 & 30, 2014) \\"Adventures on the Pacific Crest Trail\\" Inyo Register p. 15.See also Heather and Sierra's PCT Thru Hike Journal Reed Gjonnes, who thru-hiked the trail in 2011 at age 11, went on to complete the Triple Crown of Hiking, becoming the youngest person ever to do so. Teddi Boston hiked from Canada to Mexico on the PCT in 1976 at age of 49. She was one of the first women to hike the trail alone. An autobiographical account of a woman hiking a portion of the PCT alone in 1995 at age 26 was written by Cheryl Strayed. Her memoir Wild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail was published in 2012 and reached #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers list. Her hike is the subject of the 2014 film Wild, starring Reese Witherspoon. The first two reported deaths on the Pacific Crest Trail were in November 1995, when thru-hikers Jane and Flicka Rodman were killed during a detour down California State Route 138 in Southern California, when they were struck by a motorist who lost control of his vehicle. They were less than 400 miles from their goal of reaching the Mexico‚ÄìUS border. The oldest person to thru-hike the trail is not fully established, with multiple competing claims. On August 7, 2013, Heather \\"Anish\\" Anderson of Bellingham, Washington, set the current unsupported speed record. She completed the entire PCT in 60 days, 17 hours, 12 minutes,Doug Williams, Records set on Pacific Crest Trail , at ESPN Enduracne Sports, September 3, 2013 beating the previous record by almost 4 days. She documented this journey in her book, \\"Thirst\\". In 2018 she became the first woman to complete the Triple Crown of Hiking in a single calendar year. On August 10, 2014, Joseph McConaughy of Shoreline, Washington, and a former Boston College middle distance runner, set a new supported speed record and the overall fastest time for the PCT. The distance was covered in 53 days, 6 hours, and 37 minutes. This overcame the previous record of 59 days, 8 hours, 14 minutes, set by Josh Garret on August 8, 2013, by more than 6 days. Joe was supported by a team of three hikers, Jordan Hamm (a former Boston College distance runner), Michael Dillon, and Jack Murphy. McConaughy's record was broken on August 14, 2016 by Karel Sabbe, a 27-year-old dentist from Ghent, Belgium. He covered the distance in a total time of 52 days, 8 hours, and 25 minutes, averaging over 50 miles a day and shaving almost a day (22 hours) off the previous record set by McConaughy. Sabbe was supported by his friend Joren Biebuyck. With his run Sabbe was also awarded the official Guinness World Record for fastest completion of the Pacific Crest Trail. For their record runs, McConaughy as well as Sabbe had to take some official detours because of wildfires. Equestrian use Don and June Mulford made the first verifiable equestrian Thru-Ride of the PCT in 1959. In that year the Pacific Crest Trail stretched a poorly marked 2,400 miles from Mexico to Canada. More concept than footpath, the trail was an oft-broken, high-ridge track disappearing regularly from map and terrain. On April 19, 1959, on an empty scrub sage plain seven miles east of Tijuana, with four horses, Don and June Mulford began their journey north to the Washington‚ÄìCanada border. The Mulfords went to Hollywood for three months immediately after the ride and were featured on network television. June's old press book yields a half-dozen TV-Guide pages, and she recalls, \\"Art Linkletter was such a nice man. We appeared on his 'House Party' show and he had coffee with us afterward.\\" \\"High Road to Danger,\\" a syndicated TV show, made an episode on their ride. Even after they had returned home to the Northwest, there was continued TV coverage. A January 1961 TV Guide records their appearance on Portland's KOIN Red Dunning Show. The Mulfords even made a 90-minute movie and showed it around 12 western states for 10 years. The Murray family ‚Äì Barry, Bernice, Barry Jr. and Bennette ‚Äì completed the trek on horseback on October 7, 1970. Future ‚Ä¢ In 2008, an agreement for realignment through Tejon Ranch in Southern California was reached. This realignment would relocate 37 miles of the PCT from the Mojave Desert floor to the more scenic Tehachapi Mountains. While an agreement was reached, the realignment is a long-term project; many details remain to be determined, as well as an Optimal Location Review‚Äîa lengthy process through which the ideal path for the new section of trail is specified. Actual relocation of the trail is unlikely to happen before 2021. ‚Ä¢ Portland, Oregon's 40-Mile Loop proposes to extend the Springwater Corridor hiking and bicycling spur trail to connect the Pacific Crest Trail with the proposed Cazadero Trail. ‚Ä¢ Plans are currently in progress to add a dedicated pedestrian/equestrian lane to the Bridge of the Gods across the Columbia River. Currently, PCT hikers and equestrians must cross the bridge walking in vehicle traffic lanes‚Äîa potential danger which the new lane will eliminate. A completion date for this project is unknown.

The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, DIY ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music.di Perna, Alan. \\"Brave Noise‚ÄîThe History of Alternative Rock Guitar\\". Guitar World. December 1995. In September 1988, Billboard introduced \\"alternative\\" into their charting system to reflect the rise of the format across radio stations in the United States by stations like KROQ-FM in Los Angeles and WDRE-FM in New York, which were playing music from more underground, independent, and non-commercial rock artists. The genre can be found as early as the 1960s, with bands such as the Velvet Underground and other artists, continued to evolve alternative rock throughout the 1980s. Traditionally, alternative rock broadly consisted of music that differed greatly in terms of its sound, social context and regional roots. Throughout the 1980s, magazines and zines, college radio airplay, and word of mouth had increased the prominence and highlighted the diversity of alternative rock, helping to define a number of distinct styles (and music scenes) such as noise pop, indie rock, grunge, and shoegazing. Most of these subgenres had achieved minor mainstream notice and a few bands, such as H√ºsker D√º and R.E.M., were signed to major labels. But most alternative bands' commercial success was limited in comparison to other genres of rock and pop music at the time, and most acts remained signed to independent labels and received relatively little attention from mainstream radio, television, or newspapers. With the breakthrough of Nirvana and the popularity of the grunge and Britpop movements in the 1990s, alternative rock entered the musical mainstream and many alternative bands became successful. Origin of term In the past, popular music tastes were dictated by music executives within large entertainment corporations. Record companies signed contracts with those entertainers who were thought to become the most popular, and therefore who could generate the most sales. These bands were able to record their songs in expensive studios, and their works then offered for sale through record store chains that were owned by the entertainment corporations, along with eventually selling the merchandise into big box retailers. Record companies worked with radio and television companies to get the most exposure for their artists. The people making the decisions were business people dealing with music as a product, and those bands who were not making the expected sales figures were then excluded from this system. Before the term alternative rock came into common usage around 1990, the sorts of music to which it refers were known by a variety of terms.Azerrad (2001), p. 446. In 1979, Terry Tolkin used the term Alternative Music to describe the groups he was writing about.Azerrad (2001). In 1979 Dallas radio station KZEW had a late night new wave show entitled \\"Rock and Roll Alternative\\".\\"Are We Not New Wave Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s by Theo Cateforis University of Michigan Press 2011 p. 38 \\"College rock\\" was used in the United States to describe the music during the 1980s due to its links to the college radio circuit and the tastes of college students.Reynolds, p. 391 In the United Kingdom, dozens of small do it yourself record labels emerged as a result of the punk subculture. According to the founder of one of these labels, Cherry Red, NME and Sounds magazines published charts based on small record stores called \\"Alternative Charts\\". The first national chart based on distribution called the Indie Chart was published in January 1980; it immediately succeeded in its aim to help these labels. At the time, the term indie was used literally to describe independently distributed records.Stanley, Bob. \\"Will the indie chart rise again?\\". The Guardian. July 31, 2009. Retrieved July 20, 2012. By 1985, indie had come to mean a particular genre, or group of subgenres, rather than simply distribution status. The use of the term alternative to describe rock music originated around the mid-1980s;Thompson, Dave. \\"Introduction\\". Third Ear: Alternative Rock. San Francisco: Miller Freeman, 2000. p. viii. at the time, the common music industry terms for cutting-edge music were new music and post modern, respectively indicating freshness and a tendency to re contextualize sounds of the past.Reynolds, p. 338. In 1987, Spin magazine categorized college rock band Camper Van Beethoven as \\"alternative/indie\\", noting that their 1985 song \\"Where the Hell Is Bill\\" (from Telephone Free Landslide Victory) \\"called out the alternative/independent scene and dryly tore it apart.\\" David Lowery, then frontman of Camper Van Beethoven, later recalled: \\"I remember first seeing that word applied to us... The nearest I could figure is that we seemed like a punk band, but we were playing pop music, so they made up this word alternative for those of us who do that\\". DJs and promoters during the 1980s claim the term originates from American FM radio of the 1970s, which served as a progressive alternative to top 40 radio formats by featuring longer songs and giving DJs more freedom in song selection. According to one former DJ and promoter, \\"Somehow this term 'alternative' got rediscovered and heisted by college radio people during the 80s who applied it to new post-punk, indie, or underground-whatever music\\".Mullen, Brendan. Whores: An Oral Biography of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2005. p. 19. . At first the term referred to intentionally non‚Äìmainstream rock acts that were not influenced by \\"heavy metal ballads, rarefied new wave\\" and \\"high-energy dance anthems\\".Strauss, Neil. \\"Forget Pearl Jam. Alternative Rock Lives\\". The New York Times. March 2, 1997. Retrieved July 20, 2012. Usage of the term would broaden to include new wave, pop, punk rock, post-punk, and occasionally \\"college\\"/\\"indie\\" rock, all found on the American \\"commercial alternative\\" radio stations of the time such as Los Angeles' KROQ-FM. Journalist Jim Gerr wrote that Alternative also encompassed variants such as \\"rap, trash, metal and industrial\\". The bill of the first Lollapalooza, an itinerant festival in North America conceived by Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, reunited \\"disparate elements of the alternative rock community\\" including Henry Rollins, Butthole Surfers, Ice-T, Nine Inch Nails, Siouxsie and the Banshees (as second headliners) and Jane's Addiction (as the headlining act). Covering for MTV the opening date of Lollapalooza in Phoenix in July 1991, Dave Kendall introduced the report saying the festival presented the \\"most diverse lineups of alternative rock\\".Kendall, Dave. \\"MTV Week in Rock - Lollapalooza\\". youtube. July 1991. November 2, 2019. That summer, Farrell had coined the term Alternative Nation. In December 1991, Spin magazine noted: \\"this year, for the first time, it became resoundingly clear that what has formerly been considered alternative rock ‚Äì a college-centered marketing group with fairly lucrative, if limited, potential- has in fact moved into the mainstream\\". In the late 1990s, the definition again became more specific. In 1997, Neil Strauss of The New York Times defined alternative rock as \\"hard-edged rock distinguished by brittle, '70s-inspired guitar riffing and singers agonizing over their problems until they take on epic proportions\\". Defining music as alternative is often difficult because of two conflicting applications of the word. Alternative can describe music that challenges the status quo and that is \\"fiercely iconoclastic, anticommercial, and antimainstream\\", but the term is also used in the music industry to denote \\"the choices available to consumers via record stores, radio, cable television, and the Internet.\\"Starr, Larry; Waterman, Christopher. American Popular Music: From Minstrelsy to MTV. New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. p. 430. . However alternative music has paradoxically become just as commercial and marketable as the mainstream rock, with record companies using the term \\"alternative\\" to market music to an audience that mainstream rock does not reach. Using a broad definition of the genre, Dave Thompson in his book Alternative Rock cites the formation of the Sex Pistols as well as the release of the albums Horses by Patti Smith and Metal Machine Music by Lou Reed as three key events that gave birth to alternative rock. Until recent years (early 2000s) when indie rock became the most common term in the US to describe modern pop and rock, the terms \\"indie rock\\" and \\"alternative rock\\" were often used interchangeably;Fonarow, Wendy (July 28, 2011). \\"Ask the indie professor: why do Americans think they invented indie? For years, Americans never used the term 'indie', preferring to label the likes of Bush 'alternative'. But things changed\\". The Guardian. whilst there are aspects which both genres have in common, indie rock was regarded as a British-based term, unlike the more American alternative rock.Carew, Anthony. \\"Alternative Music 101 ‚Äì Is There a Difference Between 'Alternative' and 'Indie'?\\".

[ \\"American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved May 20, 2006. Throughout much of its history, alternative rock has been largely defined by its rejection of the commercialism of mainstream culture, although this could be contested ever since some of the major alternative artists have achieved mainstream success or co-opted with the major labels from the 1990s onwards (especially since the new millennium and beyond). Alternative bands during the 1980s generally played in small clubs, recorded for indie labels, and spread their popularity through word of mouth.\\"Rock Music\\". Microsoft Encarta 2006 [CD]. Redmond, WA: Microsoft Corporation, 2005. As such, there is no set musical style for alternative rock as a whole, although The New York Times in 1989 asserted that the genre is \\"guitar music first of all, with guitars that blast out power chords, pick out chiming riffs, buzz with fuzztone and squeal in feedback.\\"Pareles, Jon. \\"A New Kind of Rock\\". The New York Times. March 5, 1989. Retrieved July 19, 2009. More often than in other rock-styles since the mainstreaming of rock music during the 1970s, alternative rock lyrics tend to address topics of social concern, such as drug use, depression, suicide, and environmentalism. This approach to lyrics developed as a reflection of the social and economic strains in the United States and United Kingdom of the 1980s and early 1990s.Charlton, Katherine. Rock Music Styles: A History. McGraw Hill, 2003. P. 346‚Äì47. . History=Precursors (1960s and 1970s)= A precursor to alternative rock existed in the 1960s with the proto-punk scene. The origins of alternative rock can be traced back to The Velvet Underground & Nico (1967) by the Velvet Underground,BBC Culture \\"The Velvet Underground: As influential as The Beatles?\\" which influenced many alternative rock bands that would come after it.Britannica.com 60's eccentric and quirky figures, such as Syd Barrett have influence on alternative rock in general. =1980s= One of the first popular alternative rock bands, R.E.M. relied on college-radio airplay, constant touring, and a grassroots fanbase to break into the musical mainstream. The Dead Kennedys formed the independent record label Alternative Tentacles in 1979, releasing influential underground music such as the 1983 self-titled EP from the Butthole Surfers. By 1984, a majority of groups signed to indie labels mined from a variety of rock and particularly 1960s rock influences. This represented a sharp break from the futuristic, hyper-rational post-punk years.Reynolds, p. 392‚Äì93. Throughout the 1980s, alternative rock remained mainly an underground phenomenon. While on occasion a song would become a commercial hit or albums would receive critical praise in mainstream publications like Rolling Stone, alternative rock in the 1980s was primarily featured on independent record labels, fanzines, and college radio stations. Alternative bands built underground followings by touring constantly and by regularly releasing low-budget albums. In the case of the United States, new bands would form in the wake of previous bands, which created an extensive underground circuit in America, filled with different scenes in various parts of the country. College radio formed an essential part of breaking new alternative music. In the mid-1980s, college station KCPR in San Luis Obispo, California, described in a DJ handbook the tension between popular and \\"cutting edge\\" songs as played on \\"alternative radio.\\" Although American alternative artists of the 1980s never generated spectacular album sales, they exerted a considerable influence on later alternative musicians and laid the groundwork for their success.Azerrad (2001), p. 3‚Äì5. On September 10, 1988, an Alternative Songs chart was created by Billboard, listing the 40 most-played songs on alternative and modern rock radio stations in the US: the first number one was Siouxsie and the Banshees' \\"Peek-a-Boo\\". By 1989 the genre had become popular enough that a package tour featuring New Order, Public Image Limited and the Sugarcubes toured the United States arena circuit.\\"Review/Rock; Arena-Size Bill of Alternative Rock\\". The New York Times. July 21, 1989. \\"It was the final show on a package tour that brought what used to be post-punk alternative rock, the province of clubs and cult audiences, to the arena circuit across the United States.\\" In contrast, British alternative rock was distinguished from that of the United States early on by a more pop-oriented focus (marked by an equal emphasis on albums and singles, as well as greater openness to incorporating elements of dance and club culture) and a lyrical emphasis on specifically British concerns. As a result, few British alternative bands have achieved commercial success in the US. Since the 1980s alternative rock has been played extensively on the radio in the UK, particularly by disc jockeys such as John Peel (who championed alternative music on BBC Radio 1), Richard Skinner, and Annie Nightingale. Artists that had cult followings in the United States received greater exposure through British national radio and the weekly music press, and many alternative bands had chart success there.Charlton, p. 349. American underground in the 1980s Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth Early American alternative bands such as the Dream Syndicate, the Bongos, 10,000 Maniacs, R.E.M., the Feelies and Violent Femmes combined punk influences with folk music and mainstream music influences. R.E.M. was the most immediately successful; its debut album, Murmur (1983), entered the Top 40 and spawned a number of jangle pop followers. One of the many jangle pop scenes of the early 1980s, Los Angeles' Paisley Underground revived the sounds of the 1960s, incorporating psychedelia, rich vocal harmonies and the guitar interplay of folk rock as well as punk and underground influences such as the Velvet Underground. American indie record labels SST Records, Twin/Tone Records, Touch and Go Records, and Dischord Records presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.Reynolds, p. 390. Minneapolis bands H√ºsker D√º and the Replacements were indicative of this shift. Both started out as punk rock bands, but soon diversified their sounds and became more melodic. Michael Azerrad asserted that H√ºsker D√º was the key link between hardcore punk and the more melodic, diverse music of college rock that emerged. Azerrad wrote, \\"H√ºsker D√º played a huge role in convincing the underground that melody and punk rock weren't antithetical.\\" The band also set an example by being the first group from the American indie scene to sign to a major record label, which helped establish college rock as \\"a viable commercial enterprise.\\"Azerrad (2001), p. 159. By focusing on heartfelt songwriting and wordplay instead of political concerns, the Replacements upended a number of underground scene conventions; Azerrad noted that \\"along with R.E.M., they were one of the few underground bands that mainstream people liked.\\"Azerrad (2001), p. 196. By the late 1980s, the American alternative scene was dominated by styles ranging from quirky alternative pop (They Might Be Giants and Camper Van Beethoven), to noise rock (Sonic Youth, Big Black, the Jesus LizardErlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ \\"The Jesus Lizard Biography\\"]. AllMusic. Retrieved August 25, 2008.) and industrial rock (Ministry, Nine Inch Nails). These sounds were in turn followed by the advent of Boston's Pixies and Los Angeles' Jane's Addiction. Around the same time, the grunge subgenre emerged in Seattle, Washington, initially referred to as \\"The Seattle Sound\\" until its rise to popularity in the early 1990s. Grunge featured a sludgy, murky guitar sound that syncretized heavy metal and punk rock. Promoted largely by Seattle indie label Sub Pop, grunge bands were noted for their thrift store fashion which favored flannel shirts and combat boots suited to the local weather.Marin, Rick. \\"Grunge: A Success Story\\". The New York Times. November 15, 1992. Early grunge bands Soundgarden and Mudhoney found critical acclaim in the U.S. and UK, respectively. By the end of the decade, a number of alternative bands began to sign to major labels. While early major label signings H√ºsker D√º and the Replacements had little success, acts who signed with majors in their wake such as R.E.M. and Jane's Addiction achieved gold and platinum records, setting the stage for alternative's later breakthrough.Azerrad (1994), p. 160.Azerrad (1994), p. 4. Some bands such as Pixies had massive success overseas while they were ignored domestically. In the middle of the decade, H√ºsker D√º's album Zen Arcade influenced other hardcore acts by tackling personal issues. Out of Washington, D.C.'s hardcore scene what was called \\"emocore\\" or \\"emo\\" emerged and was noted for its lyrics which delved into emotional very personal subject matter (vocalists sometimes cried) and added free association poetry and a confessional tone. Rites of Spring has been described as the first \\"emo\\" band. Former Minor Threat singer Ian MacKaye founded Dischord Records which became the center for the city's emo scene. British subgenres and trends of the 1980s Robert Smith of the Cure Gothic rock developed out of late-1970s British post-punk. With a reputation as the \\"darkest and gloomiest form of underground rock\\", gothic rock utilizes a synthesizer-and-guitar based sound drawn from post-punk to construct \\"foreboding, sorrowful, often epic soundscapes\\", and the subgenre's lyrics often address literary romanticism, morbidity, religious symbolism, and supernatural mysticism. Bands of this subgenre took inspiration from two British post-punk groups, Joy Division and Siouxsie and the Banshees.Reynolds, p. 352. Bauhaus' debut single \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\", released in 1979, is considered to be the proper beginning of the gothic rock subgenre.Reynolds, p. 359. The Cure's \\"oppressively dispirited\\" albums including Pornography (1982) cemented that group's stature in that style and laid the foundation for its large cult following.Reynolds, p. 357‚Äì58. The key British alternative rock band to emerge during the 1980s was Manchester's the Smiths. Music journalist Simon Reynolds singled out the Smiths and their American contemporaries R.E.M. as \\"the two most important alt-rock bands of the day\\", commenting that they \\"were eighties bands only in the sense of being against the eighties\\". Reynolds noted that the Smiths' \\"whole stance was predicated on their British audience being a lost generation, exiles in their own land\\".Reynolds, p. 392. The Smiths' embrace of the guitar in an era of synthesizer-dominated music is viewed as signaling the end of the new wave era and the advent of alternative rock in the United Kingdom. Despite the band's limited chart success and short career, the Smiths exerted an influence over the British indie scene through the end of the decade, as various bands drew from singer Morrissey's English- centered lyrical topics and guitarist Johnny Marr's jangly guitar-playing style. The C86 cassette, a 1986 NME premium featuring Primal Scream, the Wedding Present and others, was a major influence on the development of indie pop and the British indie scene as a whole. Other forms of alternative rock developed in the UK during the 1980s. the Jesus and Mary Chain's sound combined the Velvet Underground's \\"melancholy noise\\" with Beach Boys pop melodies and Phil Spector's \\"Wall of Sound\\" production, while New Order emerged from the demise of post-punk band Joy Division and experimented with techno and house music. The Mary Chain, along with Dinosaur Jr., C86 and the dream pop of Cocteau Twins, were the formative influences for the shoegazing movement of the late 1980s. Named for the band members' tendency to stare at their feet and guitar effects pedals onstage rather than interact with the audience, shoegazing acts like My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive created an overwhelmingly loud \\"wash of sound\\" that obscured vocals and melodies with long, droning riffs, distortion, and feedback. Shoegazing bands dominated the British music press at the end of the decade along with the Madchester scene. Performing for the most part in the Ha√ßienda, a nightclub in Manchester owned by New Order and Factory Records, Madchester bands such as Happy Mondays and the Stone Roses mixed acid house dance rhythms with melodic guitar pop. =Popularization in the 1990s= Alanis Morissette By the start of the 1990s, the music industry was enticed by alternative rock's commercial possibilities and major labels had already signed Jane's Addiction, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Dinosaur Jr. In early 1991, R.E.M. went mainstream worldwide with Out of Time while becoming a blueprint for many alternative bands. Kurt Cobain (foreground) and Krist Novoselic with Nirvana live at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards. The first edition of the Lollapalooza festival became the most successful tour in North America in July and August 1991. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who caught it near Los Angeles in an open-air amphitheater, \\"it felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all\\". The tour helped change the mentalities in the music industry: \\"by that fall, radio and MTV and music had changed. I really think that if it weren‚Äôt for Perry [Farrell], if it weren‚Äôt for Lollapalooza, you and I wouldn‚Äôt be having this conversation right now\\". The release of the Nirvana's single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" in September 1991 \\"marked the instigation of the grunge music phenomenon\\". Helped by constant airplay of the song's music video on MTV, their album Nevermind was selling 400,000 copies a week by Christmas 1991.Lyons, p. 120. Its success surprised the music industry. Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established \\"the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general.\\" Michael Azerrad asserted that Nevermind symbolized \\"a sea-change in rock music\\" in which the hair metal that had dominated rock music at that time fell out of favor in the face of music that was authentic and culturally relevant.Azerrad (1994), p. 229‚Äì30. The breakthrough success of Nirvana led to the widespread popularization of alternative rock in the 1990s. It heralded a \\"new openness to alternative rock\\" among commercial radio stations, opening doors for heavier alternative bands in particular.Rosen, Craig. \\"Some See 'New Openness' Following Nirvana Success\\". Billboard. January 25, 1992. In the wake of Nevermind, alternative rock \\"found itself dragged-kicking and screaming ... into the mainstream\\" and record companies, confused by the genre's success yet eager to capitalize on it, scrambled to sign bands. The New York Times declared in 1993, \\"Alternative rock doesn't seem so alternative anymore. Every major label has a handful of guitar-driven bands in shapeless shirts and threadbare jeans, bands with bad posture and good riffs who cultivate the oblique and the evasive, who conceal catchy tunes with noise and hide craftsmanship behind nonchalance.\\" However, many alternative rock artists rejected success, for it conflicted with the rebellious, DIY ethic the genre had espoused before mainstream exposure and their ideas of artistic authenticity.Considine, J.D. \\"The Decade of Living Dangerously\\". Guitar World. March 1999 Grunge Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam Other grunge bands subsequently replicated Nirvana's success. Pearl Jam had released its debut album Ten a month before Nevermind in 1991, but album sales only picked up a year later. By the second half of 1992 Ten became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard 200 album chart.Pearlman, Nina. \\"Black Days\\". Guitar World. December 2002. Soundgarden's album Badmotorfinger, Alice in Chains' Dirt and Stone Temple Pilots' Core along with the Temple of the Dog album collaboration featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, were also among the 100 top- selling albums of 1992.Lyons, p. 136. The popular breakthrough of these grunge bands prompted Rolling Stone to nickname Seattle \\"the new Liverpool.\\" Major record labels signed most of the prominent grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of bands moved to the city in hopes of success.Azerrad (2001), p. 452‚Äì53. At the same time, critics asserted that advertising was co-opting elements of grunge and turning it into a fad. Entertainment Weekly commented in a 1993 article, \\"There hasn't been this kind of exploitation of a subculture since the media discovered hippies in the '60s.\\" The New York Times compared the \\"grunging of America\\" to the mass-marketing of punk rock, disco, and hip hop in previous years. As a result of the genre's popularity, a backlash against grunge developed in Seattle. Nirvana's follow-up album In Utero (1993) was an intentionally abrasive album that Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic described as a \\"wild aggressive sound, a true alternative record.\\"DeRogatis, Jim. Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. p. 18. . Nevertheless, upon its release in September 1993 In Utero topped the Billboard charts. Pearl Jam also continued to perform well commercially with its second album, Vs. (1993), which topped the Billboard charts by selling a record 950,378 copies in its first week of release. Britpop Liam and Noel Gallagher of Oasis With the decline of the Madchester scene and the unglamorousness of shoegazing, the tide of grunge from America dominated the British alternative scene and music press in the early 1990s. As a reaction, a flurry of British bands emerged that wished to \\"get rid of grunge\\" and \\"declare war on America\\", taking the public and native music press by storm.Youngs, Ian. \\"Looking back at the birth of Britpop\\". BBC News. August 14, 2005. Retrieved July 19, 2009. Dubbed \\"Britpop\\" by the media, this movement represented by Pulp, Blur, Suede, and Oasis was the British equivalent of the grunge explosion, in that the artists propelled alternative rock to the top of the charts in their home country. Britpop bands were influenced by and displayed reverence for British guitar music of the past, particularly movements and genres such as the British Invasion, glam rock, and punk rock.Harris, p. 202. In 1995 the Britpop phenomenon culminated in a rivalry between its two chief groups, Oasis and Blur, symbolized by their release of competing singles on the same day. Blur won \\"The Battle of Britpop\\", but Oasis soon eclipsed the other band in popularity with their second album, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? (1995),Harris, p. xvii. which went on to become the third best-selling album in the UK's history. Indie rock Pavement in 1993 Long synonymous with alternative rock as a whole in the US, indie rock became a distinct form following the popular breakthrough of Nirvana. Indie rock was formulated as a rejection of alternative rock's absorption into the mainstream by artists who could not or refused to cross over, and a wariness of its \\"macho\\" aesthetic. While indie rock artists share the punk rock distrust of commercialism, the genre does not entirely define itself against that, as \\"the general assumption is that it's virtually impossible to make indie rock's varying musical approaches compatible with mainstream tastes in the first place\\". Labels such as Matador Records, Merge Records, and Dischord, and indie rockers like Pavement, Superchunk, Fugazi, and Sleater-Kinney dominated the American indie scene for most of the 1990s.Azerrad (2001), pp. 495‚Äì97. One of the main indie rock movements of the 1990s was lo-fi. The movement, which focused on the recording and distribution of music on low-quality cassette tapes, initially emerged in the 1980s. By 1992, Pavement, Guided by Voices and Sebadoh became popular lo-fi cult acts in the United States, while subsequently artists like Beck and Liz Phair brought the aesthetic to mainstream audiences. The period also saw alternative confessional female singer-songwriters. Besides the aforementioned Liz Phair, PJ Harvey fit into this sub group.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ \\"PJ Harvey Biography\\"]. Billboard.com. Retrieved July 20, 2012.  Post-grunge  Creed in 2002 During the latter half of the 1990s, grunge was supplanted by post-grunge. Many post-grunge bands lacked the underground roots of grunge and were largely influenced by what grunge had become, namely \\"a wildly popular form of inward-looking, serious-minded hard rock.\\"; many post-grunge bands emulated the sound and style of grunge, \\"but not necessarily the individual idiosyncracies of its original artists.\\" Post-grunge was a more commercially viable genre that tempered the distorted guitars of grunge with polished, radio-ready production. Originally, post-grunge was a label used almost pejoratively on bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and emulated the grunge sound. The label suggested that bands labelled as post- grunge were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an \\"authentic\\" rock movement. Bush, Candlebox and Collective Soul were labelled almost pejoratively as post-grunge which, according to Tim Grierson of About.com, is \\"suggesting that rather than being a musical movement in their own right, they were just a calculated, cynical response to a legitimate stylistic shift in rock music.\\" Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands such as Foo Fighters, Creed and Nickelback emerged.  Post-rock  Post-rock was established by Talk Talk's Laughing Stock and Slint's Spiderland albums, both released in 1991. Post-rock draws influence from a number of genres, including Krautrock, progressive rock, and jazz. The genre subverts or rejects rock conventions, and often incorporates electronic music. While the name of the genre was coined by music journalist Simon Reynolds in 1994 referring to Hex by the London group Bark Psychosis, the style of the genre was solidified by the release of Millions Now Living Will Never Die (1996) by the Chicago group Tortoise. Post-rock became the dominant form of experimental rock music in the 1990s and bands from the genre signed to such labels as Thrill Jockey, Kranky, Drag City, and Too Pure. A related genre, math rock, peaked in the mid-1990s. In comparison to post-rock, math rock relies on more complex time signatures and intertwining phrases. By the end of the decade a backlash had emerged against post-rock due to its \\"dispassionate intellectuality\\" and its perceived increasing predictability, but a new wave of post-rock bands such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Sigur R√≥s emerged who further expanded the genre.  Other trends  Reel Big Fish performing in 2008 In 1993, Smashing Pumpkins album Siamese Dream was a major commercial success. The strong influence of heavy metal and progressive rock on the album helped to legitimize alternative rock to mainstream radio programmers and close the gap between alternative rock and the type of rock played on American 1970s Album Oriented Rock radio. In 1995, Smashing Pumpkins also released their double album Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness which went on to sell 10 million copies in the US alone, certifying it as a Diamond record. After almost a decade in the underground, ska punk, a mixture of earlier British ska and punk acts, became popular in the United States. Rancid was the first of the \\"Third Wave Ska Revival\\" acts to break. In 1996, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt, Sublime, Goldfinger, Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake and Save Ferris charted or received radio exposure.Thompson, Dave. Alternative Rock : Third Ear ‚Äì The Essential Listening Companion. Backbeat Books, 2000. p 112. Change in sound By the end of the decade, alternative rock's style changed due to a number of events, notably the death of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain in 1994 and Pearl Jam's lawsuit against concert venue promoter Ticketmaster, which in effect barred the group from playing many major venues around the United States. In addition to the decline of grunge bands, Britpop faded as Oasis's third album, Be Here Now (1997), received lackluster reviews and Blur began to incorporate influences from American alternative rock.Harris, p. xix. A signifier of alternative rock's changes was the hiatus of the Lollapalooza festival after an unsuccessful attempt to find a headliner in 1998. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, \\"Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now\\".Weisbard, Eric. \\"This Monkey's Gone to Heaven\\". Spin. July 1998. Despite a change in style, alternative rock still managed to be mainstream. Post-grunge remained commercially viable into the start of the 21st century, when bands like Creed and Matchbox Twenty became among the most popular rock bands in the United States. At the same time Britpop began to decline, Radiohead achieved critical acclaim with its third album OK Computer (1997), and its follow-ups Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), which were in marked contrast with the traditionalism of Britpop. Radiohead, along with post-Britpop groups like Travis and Coldplay, were major forces in British rock in subsequent years.Harris, p. 369‚Äì70. Emo band Jimmy Eat World performing in 2007 In the mid-1990s, Sunny Day Real Estate defined the emo genre. Weezer's album Pinkerton (1996) was also influential. By 2000 and on into the new decade, emo was one of the most popular rock music genres. Popular acts included the sales success of Bleed American by Jimmy Eat World (2001) and Dashboard Confessional's The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most (2003).. The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal amongst adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term \\"emo\\" expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion.. Emo's mainstream success continued with bands emerging in the 2000s, including multi-platinum acts such as Fall Out Boy. and My Chemical Romance. and mainstream groups such as Paramore and Panic! at the Disco.. =21st century= Muse performing in 2010 During the late 1990s and early 2000s, several alternative rock bands emerged, including the Strokes, Franz Ferdinand, Interpol and the Rapture that drew primary inspiration from post- punk and new wave, establishing the post-punk revival movement. Preceded by the success of bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes earlier in the decade, an influx of new alternative rock bands, including several post-punk revival artists and others such as the Killers, and Yeah Yeah Yeahs, found commercial success in the early and mid 2000s. Owing to the success of these bands, Entertainment Weekly declared in 2004, \\"After almost a decade of domination by rap-rock and nu-metal bands, mainstream alt-rock is finally good again.\\" Thirty Seconds to Mars experienced a notable rise in popularity during the latter half of the 2000s. American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers entered a new-found popularity in 1999 after the release of their album Californication (1999), with continued success throughout the 2000s. Arctic Monkeys were a prominent act to owe their initial commercial success to the use of Internet social networking,A. Goetchius, Career Building Through Social Networking (The Rosen Publishing Group, 2007), , pp. 21‚Äì2. with two UK No. 1 singles and Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), which became the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history. Twenty One Pilots performing in 2016 Most references to alternative rock music in the United States past 2010 are to the indie rock genre, a term that previously had limited usage on alternative rock channels and media. Radio Stations in the 2010s have been changing formats away from alternative rock, but this is mostly motivated by conglomeration efforts coupled with advertisers seeking more Top 40/Top 100 stations for sales. While there have been conflicting opinions on the relevance of alternative rock to mainstream audiences beyond 2010, Dave Grohl commented on an article from the December 29, 2013 issue of the New York Daily News stating that rock is dead: \\"speak for yourself... rock seems pretty alive to me.\\" Contemporary mainstream alternative rock bands tend to fuse musical elements of hard rock, electronica, hip-hop, indie and punk while placing emphasis on keyboards and guitar. In 2010s, British rock band Muse gained a worldwide recognition with their album The Resistance and Drones which won Grammy Awards. American alternative duo Twenty One Pilots blurs the lines between genres including hip hop, emo, rock, indie pop and reggae and has managed to break numerous records. They became the first alternative act to have two concurrent top five singles in the United States while their fourth studio album Blurryface (2015) was the first album in history to have every song receive at least a Gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Twenty One Pilots also became the first rock act to have a song reach a billion streams on Spotify. Their breakout hit single \\"Stressed Out\\" was the twenty-fifth song to achieve the rare feat of at least one billion plays on the streaming platform. The milestone comes at a time when music genres represented on streaming platforms like Spotify are fairly homogeneous, being dominated by genres such as hip hop, EDM, and adult contemporary-styled pop.

Victory over Napoleonic France left the British without any serious international rival, other than perhaps Russia in central Asia.Porter, p. 401. When Russia tried expanding its influence in the Balkans, the British and French defeated them in the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856), thereby protecting the Ottoman Empire. Britain's Royal Navy controlled most of the key maritime trade routes and enjoyed unchallenged sea power (in the latter part of the period such supremacy being protected by the \\"two-power standard\\"). Alongside the formal control exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled access to many regions, such as Asia and Latin America. The British also, much to the dismay of other colonial empires, helped the United States uphold the Monroe Doctrine which helped maintain peace within the Americas. British merchants, shippers and bankers had such an overwhelming advantage over everyone else that in addition to its colonies it had an \\"informal empire\\".Porter, p. 8.Marshall, pp. 156‚Äì57.Cameron, pp. 45-47. History After losing the American colonies in the American Revolution, Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the Second British Empire (1783‚Äì1815). The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain in the late 1700s and new ideas emerged about free markets, such as Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations (1776). Free trade became a central principle that Britain practiced by the 1840s. It played a key role in Britain's economic growth and financial dominance.Darwin, p. 391. Map of the British Empire (as of 1910) From the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 until World War I in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of global hegemon (most powerful actor). Imposition of a \\"British Peace\\" on key maritime trade routes began in 1815 with the annexation of British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka).Crawfurd, pp. 191‚Äì192: \\"...for what purpose was it conquered and is it now retained?' We endeavoured to explain, that during the wars, in which we were lately engaged with our European enemies who occupied the coast of the island, they harassed our commerce from its ports, and therefore, in self-defence, there was a necessity for taking possession of it.\\" Under the British Residency of the Persian Gulf, local Arab rulers agreed to a number of treaties that formalised Britain's protection of the region. Britain imposed an anti-piracy treaty, known as the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, on all Arab rulers in the region. By signing the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, Arab rulers gave up their right to wage war at sea in return for British protection against external threats. The global superiority of British military and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental Europe, and the presence of the Royal Navy on all of the world's oceans and seas. Even outside its formal empire, Britain controlled trade with many countries such as China, Siam, and Argentina. Following the Congress of Vienna the British Empire's economic strength continued to develop through naval dominancePugh, p. 83. and diplomatic efforts to maintain a balance of power in continental Europe.Thackeray, p. 57. In this era, the Royal Navy provided services around the world that benefited other nations, such as the suppression of piracy and blocking the slave trade. The Slave Trade Act 1807 had banned the trade across the British Empire, after which the Royal Navy established the West Africa Squadron and the government negotiated international treaties under which they could enforce the ban.Falola, pp. xxi, xxxiii-xxxiv. Sea power, however, did not project on land. Land wars fought between the major powers include the Crimean War, the Franco-Austrian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War, as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the First Opium War (18391842) and Second Opium War (18561860) against Imperial China. The Royal Navy was superior to any other two navies in the world, combined. Between 1815 and the passage of the German naval laws of 1890 and 1898, only France was a potential naval threat. The most decisive event emerged from the Anglo-Egyptian War, which resulted in the British occupation of Egypt for seven decades, even though the Ottoman Empire retained nominal ownership until 1914.M.W. Daly, ed. The Cambridge History Of Egypt Volume 2 Modern Egypt, from 1517 to the end of the twentieth century (1998) online Historian A.J.P. Taylor says that this \\"was a great event; indeed, the only real event in international relations between the Battle of Sedan and the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese war.\\"He adds, \\"All the rest were maneuvers which left the combatants at the close of the day exactly where they had started.\\" A.J.P. Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" in F.H. Hinsley, ed., The New Cambridge Modern History: XI: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870‚Äì98 (1962): 554. Taylor emphasizes the long-term impact: : The British occupation of Egypt altered the balance of power. It not only gave the British security for their route to India; it made them masters of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East; it made it unnecessary for them to stand in the front line against Russia at the Straits....And thus prepared the way for the Franco-Russian Alliance ten years later.Taylor, \\"International Relations\\" p 554 Britain traded goods and capital extensively with countries around the world, adopting a free trade policy after 1840. The growth of British imperial strength was further underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph, new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called All Red Line.Dalziel, pp. 88‚Äì91. The Pax Britannica was weakened by the breakdown of the continental order which had been established by the Congress of Vienna.Pugh, p. 90. Relations between the Great Powers of Europe were strained to breaking point by issues such as the decline of the Ottoman Empire, which led to the Crimean War, and later the emergence of new nation states in the form of Italy and Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. Both of these wars involved Europe's largest states and armies. The industrialisation of Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the United States contributed to the relative decline of British industrial supremacy in the late 19th century.

It became the nexus for those at the cutting-edge of art at the time, when Erik Satie, Henri Matisse, Nina Hamnett, Amedeo Modigliani, Ossip Zadkine, Olga Sacharoff, Juan Gris, and Chaim Soutine started dropping by in the evenings for conversation and occasionally to draw. Before long the walls of Marie Vassilieff's atelier held a collection of paintings by Marc Chagall and Modigliani, drawings by Picasso and Fernand L√©ger, and in a corner, sat a sculpture by Zadkine. By 1913, her studio was so widely known that Fernand L√©ger gave two lectures there on the topic of Modern art. What Marie Vassilieff is most remembered for, however, is her canteen that operated before and during World War I. She volunteered as a nurse in the French Red Cross and saw how badly the financial situation had become for many of the artists of Paris who were already struggling. Because many of her artist acquaintances frequently had little or nothing to eat, in 1915, she opened the canteen that provided a full meal and a glass of wine for only a few centimes. While her canteen provided a valuable service, during the war it became a popular gathering place for the artistic community. During the war a government curfew was put into place. The restaurants and caf√©s of Paris all were obliged to close early, however, Marie Vassilieff's canteen was licensed as a private club and, therefore, not subject to the curfew. As a result, soon her place became crowded and at night, filled with music and dancing. In January 1917, Georges Braque, who had been wounded fighting in World War I, was released from military service. Marie Vassilieff and Max Jacob decided to organize a dinner for Braque and his wife, Marcelle. Among the guests was Alfredo Pina with his new companion, Beatrice Hastings, who had recently ended her two-year relationship with Amedeo Modigliani. Knowing Modigliani's penchant for causing a disturbance when he drank, and that he drank often, Marie Vassilieff did not invite Modigliani to Braque's party. The art community was small, however, and word of the get-together soon reached Modigliani. An uninvited, and very drunk, Modigliani showed up, looking for a fight. A scuffle ensued, a pistol appeared, and Marie Vassilieff, all five feet of her, pushed Modigliani downstairs while Pablo Picasso and Manuel Ortiz de Zarate locked the door. Marie Vassilieff made what is now a very famous drawing depicting the events of the evening. Marie Vassilieff's own artwork is primarily in the Cubist style, her most interesting paintings are portraits of dancers as well as those of her friends, Jean Cocteau, Picasso, and Matisse. Known, too, for her decorative furniture pieces and her doll-portraits, Vassilieff's works remain very popular. Although her works never gained the lofty stature or astounding prices of some of her renowned contemporaries, today they may be found in museums and private collections worldwide. As both an artist and friend, Marie Vassilieff was an integral part of the great creative community of Montparnasse, where today one may still see her ornamental panels, created in 1927 for the pillars in the dining room of the La Coupole. After several exhibitions in London in 1928 and 1930, and in Italy in 1929, she opened the Vassilieff Museum. Friends with Alfred Jarry, she organized a homage to him. Marie Vassilieff died at a home for elderly artists in Nogent-sur-Marne, √éle- de-France, France. In 1998, the Mus√©e du Montparnasse was opened in Marie Vassilieff's old studio. The museum closed in 2015.

After having success in the minor leagues during the early 1920s, Grove became a star in Major League Baseball with the American League's Philadelphia Athletics and Boston Red Sox. One of the greatest pitchers in history, Grove led the American League in wins in four separate seasons, in strikeouts seven years in a row, and had the league's lowest earned run average a record nine times. Over the course of the three years from 1929 to 1931, he twice won the pitcher's Triple Crown, leading the league in wins, strikeouts, and ERA, while amassing a 79-15 record and leading the Athletics to three straight AL championships.Baseball Hall of Fame Overall, Grove won 300 games in his 17-year MLB career. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. Early life Grove was born in Lonaconing, Maryland, one of eight children of John Robert Grove (1865‚Äì1957) and Emma Catherine Beeman (1872‚Äì1959). His father and brothers mined coal. Grove was a sandlot star in the Baltimore area during the 1910s. Grove didn't play organized baseball until he was 19 years old. In 1920, he made his professional debut with the Martinsburg Mountaineers of the class-D Blue Ridge League, where he appeared in six games. In 59 innings pitched, Grove gave up just 30 hits, and he had an earned run average (ERA) of 1.68.Lefty Grove Minor League Statistics & History His performance attracted the attention of Jack Dunn, Sr. (1872‚Äì1928), the manager/owner of the minor league Baltimore Orioles, who also discovered Babe Ruth. Baltimore Orioles (minor league) Grove joined the Baltimore Orioles in 1920, while they were playing a half- century in the minor leagues of first the old Eastern League (1903‚Äì1914) and then after 1916, in the reorganized International League of AAA ball. Grove broke into the team's pitching rotation at midseason and had a 12-2 record the rest of the way. The Orioles were in the middle of winning six straight IL titles from 1919 to 1925. Over the next four seasons, Grove posted marks of 25-10, 18-8, 27-10 and 26-6, leading the International League in strikeouts each season. Grove remained in the minor leagues through 1924, as owner Jack Dunn refused several offers from the majors to acquire him. At the time, the Orioles were an independent operation with no major league affiliation and the International League had declared its players not subject to a major league draft. Since the reserve clause in all contracts was honored throughout organized baseball, this meant that Grove had no way to reach the majors until the Orioles became willing to trade or sell his contract. Finally, early in 1925, Dunn agreed to sell Grove's rights to Connie Mack (1862‚Äì1956) and his Philadelphia Athletics in the American League for $100,600 (equivalent to $ million in ), the highest amount ever paid for a player at the time. Philadelphia Athletics Grove battled injuries as a major league rookie and posted a 10-13 mark (which would prove his only losing record in 17 major league seasons), despite leading the league in strikeouts. Grove then settled down in 1926 and won the first of a record nine earned run average (ERA) titles with a mark of 2.51. In 1927, Grove won 20 games for the first time, and a year later he led the league in wins with 24. The Athletics won the AL pennant in three successive seasons from 1929 to 1931, as well as consecutive World Series championships in 1929 and 1930. During the Athletics' championship run, Grove led the way as the league's top pitcher, posting records of 20-6, 28-5 and 31-4. In 1931, Grove led the league in wins, ERA (2.06), strikeouts (175), winning percentage, complete games, and shutouts. His 2.06 ERA was 2.32 runs below the league average.Baseball's Top 100: The Game's Greatest Records, p. 51, Kerry Banks, 2010, Greystone Books, Vancouver, BC, He was also chosen as league MVP in 1931, making him one of only a handful of pitchers to achieve this honor. His MVP award is the only one not enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, instead being housed at the George's Creek Library in Lonaconing, Maryland. The Athletics contended for the next two seasons, but finished second to the New York Yankees in 1932 and third behind the Washington Senators and Yankees in 1933. In 1933, Grove became the first player in Major League Baseball history to strike out five times in a nine-inning game.Solomon, Abbot Neil, \\"Baseball Records Illustrated\\", Quintet Publishing, London, 1988 On December 12, 1933, team owner Connie Mack traded Grove, along with Max Bishop and Rube Walberg, to the Boston Red Sox for Bob Kline, Rabbit Warstler and $125,000. Boston Red Sox A 1933 Goudey baseball card of Grove. Grove was unable to contribute substantially during his first year in Boston, an arm injury holding him to an 8-8 record. In 1935, however, Grove returned to form with a 20-12 record and a league-leading 2.70 ERA. In the 1936 season, he had a 2.81 ERA (winning his 7th ERA title) while recording a 17-12 record and 130 strikeouts. Grove won his eighth ERA title a year later while having a 17-9 record along with 153 strikeouts. He pitched 262 innings for the season; this was his 11th and final season where he pitched over 200 innings. Grove continued to post outstanding records, including 14-4 in 1938 and 15-4 in 1939, as well as lead the AL in ERA four times between 1935 and 1939. He had a 7-6 record in 1940 while recording a 3.99 ERA with 62 strikeouts in 153.1 innings. In his last season, he won and lost 7 games, winning his 300th game on July 25 (giving up 6 runs on 12 hits, but winning 10-6), before losing his last three major league games, ending his career on September 28, pitching just one inning in the 2nd game of a doubleheader. Personal life Grove married his childhood sweetheart, Ethel Gardner, in 1921. They had two children, Robert and Doris. The couple would later divorce after Grove had an affair with another woman. Grove was elected to the town council in his native Lonaconing in the 1950s and also served as the town's police chief. During offseasons and after retiring, Grove operated a bowling alley in Lonaconing. Grove often donated equipment to local youth baseball players in his retirement. Legacy Grove retired in 1941 with a career record of 300-141. His .680 lifetime winning percentage is eighth all-time;Career Leaders & Records for Win-Loss % from Baseball-Reference however, none of the seven men ahead of him won more than 236 games. His lifetime ERA of 3.06, when normalized to overall league ERA and adjusted for the parks in which Grove played during his career, is fifth all-time among pitchers with at least 1,000 innings pitched (behind Mariano Rivera, Clayton Kershaw, Jim Devlin, and Pedro Mart√≠nez) at 48 percent better than average.Career Leaders & Records for Adjusted ERA+ from Baseball-Reference As a hitter, Grove posted a .148 batting average (202-for-1,369) with 119 runs, 15 home runs, 121 RBI and 105 bases on balls. From 1929 through 1932, Grove had 56 RBI. Defensively, he recorded a .954 fielding percentage. Grove was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1947. He died in Norwalk, Ohio, on May 22, 1975 and was interred in the Frostburg Memorial Cemetery in Frostburg, Maryland. In 1969, Grove was voted the left handed starting pitcher for Major League Baseball's 100th anniversary team. In 1999, Grove was ranked number 23 on The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players.Baseball's 100 Greatest Players by The Sporting News He ranked second, behind only Warren Spahn, among left-handed pitchers. That same year, Grove was elected to the Major League Baseball All- Century Team. In the 2001 book The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, Bill James ranked Grove as the 19th best baseball player of all time and the second-best MLB pitcher of all time. = Memorial Park = The objective of the Lefty Grove Memorial Committee is to preserve the memory of Grove.

The text of the prayer book is seen from top to bottom, the original Archimedes manuscript is seen as fainter text below it running from left to right Discovery reported in the New York Times on July 16, 1907 The Archimedes Palimpsest is a parchment codex palimpsest, originally a Byzantine Greek copy of a compilation of Archimedes and other authors, containing two unknown works of Archimedes (the \\"Stomachion\\" and the \\"Method of Mechanical Theorems\\") and the only surviving original Greek edition of his work \\"On Floating Bodies.\\" The first version of the compilation is believed to have been produced by Isidorus of Miletus, the architect of the geometrically complex Hagia Sophia cathedral in Constantinople, sometime around 530 AD. The copy found in the palimpsest was created from this original, also in Constantinople, during the Macedonian Renaissance (c. 950 AD), a time when math in the capital was being revived by the former Greek Orthodox bishop of Thessaloniki Leo the Geometer, a cousin of the Patriarch.Reviel Netz, William Noel and Nigel Wilson. The Archimedes Palimpsest, Vol. 1. Catalogue and Commentary, Cambridge University press, 2011. Following the sack of Constantinople by Western crusaders in 1204 AD, the manuscript was taken to an isolated Greek monastery in Palestine, possibly to protect it from occupying crusaders, who often equated Greek script with heresy against their Latin church and either burned or looted many such texts (including at least two other copies of Archimedes). The complex manuscript was not appreciated at this remote monastery and was soon overwritten (1229 AD) with a religious text. In 1899, nine hundred years after it was written, the manuscript was still in the possession of the Greek church, and back in Istanbul, where it was catalogued by the Greek scholar Papadopoulos-Kerameus, attracting the attention of Johan Heiberg. Heiberg visited the church library and was allowed to make detailed photographs in 1906. Most of the original text was still visible, and Heiberg published it in 1915. In 1922 the manuscript went missing in the midst of the evacuation of the Greek Orthodox library in Istanbul, during a tumultuous period marked by the genocide of the Greek population in Turkey. Concealed for over 70 years by a Western businessman, forged pictures were painted on top of some text to increase resale value. Unable to sell the book privately, in 1998 the businessman's daughter risked a public auction in New York contested by the Greek church; the U.S. court ruled for the auction, and the manuscript was purchased by a wealthy American. The texts under the forged pictures, and previously unreadable texts, were revealed by analyzing images produced by ultraviolet, infrared, visible and raking light, and X-ray. All images and transcriptions are now freely available on the web at the Archimedes Digital Palimpsest (see External Links), under the Creative Commons License CC BY. alt= The Archimedes Palimpsest History=Early= Archimedes lived in the 3rd century BC and wrote his proofs as letters in Doric Greek addressed to contemporaries, including scholars at the Great Library of Alexandria. These letters were first compiled into a comprehensive text by Isidorus of Miletus, the architect of the Hagia Sophia patriarchal church, sometime around 530 AD in the then Byzantine Greek capital city of Constantinople. A copy of Isidorus' edition of Archimedes was made around 950 AD by an anonymous scribe, again in the Byzantine Empire, in a period during which the study of Archimedes flourished in Constantinople in a school founded by the mathematician, engineer, and former Greek Orthodox archbishop of Thessaloniki, Leo the Geometer, a cousin to the patriarch. This medieval Byzantine manuscript then traveled from Constantinople to Jerusalem, likely sometime after the Crusader sack of Byzantine Constantinople in 1204. There, in 1229, the Archimedes codex was unbound, scraped and washed, along with at least six other partial parchment manuscripts, including one with works of Hypereides. Their leaves were folded in half, rebound and reused for a Christian liturgical text of 177 later numbered leaves, of which 174 are extant (each older folded leaf became two leaves of the liturgical book). The palimpsest remained near Jerusalem through at least the 16th century at the isolated Greek Orthodox monastery of Mar Saba. At some point before 1840 the palimpsest was brought back by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem to its library (the Metochion of the Holy Sepulcher) in Constantinople. =Modern= The Biblical scholar Constantin von Tischendorf visited Constantinople in the 1840s, and, intrigued by the Greek mathematics visible on the palimpsest he found in a Greek Orthodox library, removed a leaf of it (which is now in the Cambridge University Library). In 1899 the Greek scholar Papadopoulos-Kerameus produced a catalog of the library's manuscripts and included a transcription of several lines of the partially visible underlying text. Upon seeing these lines Johan Heiberg, the world's authority on Archimedes, realized that the work was by Archimedes. When Heiberg studied the palimpsest in Constantinople in 1906, he confirmed that the palimpsest included works by Archimedes thought to have been lost. Heiberg was permitted by the Greek Orthodox Church to take careful photographs of the palimpsest's pages, and from these he produced transcriptions, published between 1910 and 1915 in a complete works of Archimedes. Shortly thereafter Archimedes' Greek text was translated into English by T. L. Heath. Before that it was not widely known among mathematicians, physicists or historians. The manuscript was still in the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem's library (the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre) in Constantinople in 1920. Shortly thereafter, during a turbulent period for the Greek community in Turkey that saw a Turkish victory in the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì22) along with the Greek genocide and the forced population exchange between Greece and Turkey, the palimpsest disappeared from the Greek church's library in Istanbul. Sometime between 1923 and 1930 the palimpsest was acquired by Marie Louis Sirieix, a \\"businessman and traveler to the Orient who lived in Paris.\\" Though Sirieix claimed to have bought the manuscript from a monk, who would not in any case have had the authority to sell it, Sirieix had no receipt or documentation for a sale of the valuable manuscript. Stored secretly for years by Sirieix in his cellar, the palimpsest suffered damage from water and mold. In addition, after disappearing from the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate's library, a forger added copies of medieval evangelical portraits in gold leaf onto four pages in the book in order to increase its sales value, further damaging the text. These forged gold leaf portraits nearly obliterated the text underneath them, and x-ray fluorescence imaging at Stanford would later be required to reveal it. Sirieix died in 1956, and in 1970 his daughter began attempting quietly to sell the valuable manuscript. Unable to sell it privately, in 1998 she finally turned to Christie's to sell it in a public auction, risking an ownership dispute. The ownership of the palimpsest was immediately contested in federal court in New York in the case of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem v. Christie's, Inc. The Greek church contended that the palimpsest had been stolen from its library in Constantinople in the 1920s during a period of extreme persecution. Judge Kimba Wood decided in favor of Christie's Auction House on laches grounds, and the palimpsest was bought for $2 million by an anonymous American buyer. Simon Finch, who represented the anonymous buyer, stated that the buyer was \\"a private American\\" who worked in \\"the high-tech industry\\", but was not Bill Gates. =Imaging and digitization= After imaging a page from the palimpsest, the original Archimedes text is now seen clearly At the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, the palimpsest was the subject of an extensive imaging study from 1999 to 2008, and conservation (as it had suffered considerably from mold while in Sirieix's cellar). This was directed by Dr. Will Noel, curator of manuscripts at the Walters Art Museum, and managed by Michael B. Toth of R.B. Toth Associates, with Dr. Abigail Quandt performing the conservation of the manuscript. A team of imaging scientists including Dr. Roger L. Easton, Jr. from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Dr. William A. Christens-Barry from Equipoise Imaging, and Dr. Keith Knox (then with Boeing LTS, now retired from the USAF Research Laboratory) used computer processing of digital images from various spectral bands, including ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths to reveal most of the underlying text, including of Archimedes. After imaging and digitally processing the entire palimpsest in three spectral bands prior to 2006, in 2007 they reimaged the entire palimpsest in 12 spectral bands, plus raking light: UV: 365 nanometers; Visible Light: 445, 470, 505, 530, 570, 617, and 625 nm; Infrared: 700, 735, and 870 nm; and Raking Light: 910 and 470 nm. The team digitally processed these images to reveal more of the underlying text with pseudocolor. They also digitized the original Heiberg images. Dr. Reviel Netz of Stanford University and Nigel Wilson have produced a diplomatic transcription of the text, filling in gaps in Heiberg's account with these images.Reviel Netz, William Noel and Nigel Wilson. The Archimedes Palimpsest, Vol. 1. Catalogue and Commentary; Vol. 2. Images and Transcriptions, Cambridge University press, 2011. Sometime after 1938, a forger placed four Byzantine- style religious images in the manuscript in an effort to increase its sales value. It appeared that these had rendered the underlying text forever illegible. However, in May 2005, highly focused X-rays produced at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, California, were used by Drs. Uwe Bergman and Bob Morton to begin deciphering the parts of the 174-page text that had not yet been revealed. The production of X-ray fluorescence was described by Keith Hodgson, director of SSRL: \\"Synchrotron light is created when electrons traveling near the speed of light take a curved path around a storage ring‚Äîemitting electromagnetic light in X-ray through infrared wavelengths. The resulting light beam has characteristics that make it ideal for revealing the intricate architecture and utility of many kinds of matter‚Äîin this case, the previously hidden work of one of the founding fathers of all science.\\" In April 2007, it was announced that a new text had been found in the palimpsest, which was a commentary on Aristotle's Categories running to some 9 000 words. Most of this text was recovered in early 2009 by applying principal component analysis to the three color bands (red, green, and blue) of fluorescent light generated by ultraviolet illumination. Dr. Will Noel said in an interview: \\"You start thinking striking one palimpsest is gold, and striking two is utterly astonishing. But then something even more extraordinary happened.\\" This referred to the previous discovery of a text by Hypereides, an Athenian politician from the fourth century BC, which has also been found within the palimpsest. It is from his speech Against Diondas, and was published in 2008 in the German scholarly magazine Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 165, becoming the first new text from the palimpsest to be published in a scholarly journal.Carey, C. et al., \\"Fragments of Hyperides‚Äô Against Diondas from the Archimedes Palimpsest\\", \\"Inhaltsverzeichnis\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, vol. 165, pp. 1‚Äì19.

In his other works, Archimedes often proves the equality of two areas or volumes with Eudoxus' method of exhaustion, an ancient Greek counterpart of the modern method of limits. Since the Greeks were aware that some numbers were irrational, their notion of a real number was a quantity Q approximated by two sequences, one providing an upper bound and the other a lower bound. If you find two sequences U and L, with U always bigger than Q, and L always smaller than Q, and if the two sequences eventually came closer together than any prespecified amount, then Q is found, or exhausted, by U and L. Archimedes used exhaustion to prove his theorems. This involved approximating the figure whose area he wanted to compute into sections of known area, which provide upper and lower bounds for the area of the figure. He then proved that the two bounds become equal when the subdivision becomes arbitrarily fine. These proofs, still considered to be rigorous and correct, used geometry with rare brilliance. Later writers often criticized Archimedes for not explaining how he arrived at his results in the first place. This explanation is contained in The Method. The method that Archimedes describes was based upon his investigations of physics, on the center of mass and the law of the lever. He compared the area or volume of a figure of which he knew the total mass and center of mass with the area or volume of another figure he did not know anything about. He viewed plane figures as made out of infinitely many lines as in the later method of indivisibles, and balanced each line, or slice, of one figure against a corresponding slice of the second figure on a lever. The essential point is that the two figures are oriented differently, so that the corresponding slices are at different distances from the fulcrum, and the condition that the slices balance is not the same as the condition that the figures are equal. Once he shows that each slice of one figure balances each slice of the other figure, he concludes that the two figures balance each other. But the center of mass of one figure is known, and the total mass can be placed at this center and it still balances. The second figure has an unknown mass, but the position of its center of mass might be restricted to lie at a certain distance from the fulcrum by a geometrical argument, by symmetry. The condition that the two figures balance now allows him to calculate the total mass of the other figure. He considered this method as a useful heuristic but always made sure to prove the results he found using exhaustion, since the method did not provide upper and lower bounds. Using this method, Archimedes was able to solve several problems now treated by integral calculus, which was given its modern form in the seventeenth century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Among those problems were that of calculating the center of gravity of a solid hemisphere, the center of gravity of a frustum of a circular paraboloid, and the area of a region bounded by a parabola and one of its secant lines. (For explicit details, see Archimedes' use of infinitesimals.) When rigorously proving theorems, Archimedes often used what are now called Riemann sums. In \\"On the Sphere and Cylinder,\\" he gives upper and lower bounds for the surface area of a sphere by cutting the sphere into sections of equal width. He then bounds the area of each section by the area of an inscribed and circumscribed cone, which he proves have a larger and smaller area correspondingly. He adds the areas of the cones, which is a type of Riemann sum for the area of the sphere considered as a surface of revolution. But there are two essential differences between Archimedes' method and 19th- century methods: # Archimedes did not know about differentiation, so he could not calculate any integrals other than those that came from center-of-mass considerations, by symmetry. While he had a notion of linearity, to find the volume of a sphere he had to balance two figures at the same time; he never figured out how to change variables or integrate by parts. # When calculating approximating sums, he imposed the further constraint that the sums provide rigorous upper and lower bounds. This was required because the Greeks lacked algebraic methods that could establish that error terms in an approximation are small. A problem solved exclusively in the Method is the calculation of the volume of a cylindrical wedge, a result that reappears as theorem XVII (schema XIX) of Kepler's Stereometria. Some pages of the Method remained unused by the author of the palimpsest and thus they are still lost. Between them, an announced result concerned the volume of the intersection of two cylinders, a figure that Apostol and Mnatsakanian have renamed n = 4 Archimedean globe (and the half of it, n = 4 Archimedean dome), whose volume relates to the n-polygonal pyramid. =Stomachion= Ostomachion is a dissection puzzle in the Archimedes Palimpsest (shown after Suter from a different source; this version must be stretched to twice the width to conform to the Palimpsest) In Heiberg's time, much attention was paid to Archimedes' brilliant use of indivisibles to solve problems about areas, volumes, and centers of gravity. Less attention was given to the Stomachion, a problem treated in the palimpsest that appears to deal with a children's puzzle. Reviel Netz of Stanford University has argued that Archimedes discussed the number of ways to solve the puzzle, that is, to put the pieces back into their box. No pieces have been identified as such; the rules for placement, such as whether pieces are allowed to be turned over, are not known; and there is doubt about the board. The board illustrated here, as also by Netz, is one proposed by Heinrich Suter in translating an unpointed Arabic text in which twice and equals are easily confused; Suter makes at least a typographical error at the crucial point, equating the lengths of a side and diagonal, in which case the board cannot be a rectangle. But, as the diagonals of a square intersect at right angles, the presence of right triangles makes the first proposition of Archimedes' Stomachion immediate. Rather, the first proposition sets up a board consisting of two squares side by side (as in Tangram). A reconciliation of the Suter board with this Codex board was published by Richard Dixon Oldham, FRS, in Nature in March, 1926, sparking a Stomachion craze that year. Modern combinatorics reveals that the number of ways to place the pieces of the Suter board to reform their square, allowing them to be turned over, is 17,152; the number is considerably smaller ‚Äì 64 ‚Äì if pieces are not allowed to be turned over. The sharpness of some angles in the Suter board makes fabrication difficult, while play could be awkward if pieces with sharp points are turned over. For the Codex board (again as with Tangram) there are three ways to pack the pieces: as two unit squares side by side; as two unit squares one on top of the other; and as a single square of side the square root of two. But the key to these packings is forming isosceles right triangles, just as Socrates gets the slave boy to consider in Plato's Meno ‚Äì Socrates was arguing for knowledge by recollection, and here pattern recognition and memory seem more pertinent than a count of solutions. The Codex board can be found as an extension of Socrates' argument in a seven-by- seven-square grid, suggesting an iterative construction of the side-diameter numbers that give rational approximations to the square root of two. The fragmentary state of the palimpsest leaves much in doubt. But it would certainly add to the mystery had Archimedes used the Suter board in preference to the Codex board. However, if Netz is right, this may have been the most sophisticated work in the field of combinatorics in Greek antiquity. Either Archimedes used the Suter board, the pieces of which were allowed to be turned over, or the statistics of the Suter board are irrelevant.

It has approximately 39,000 enrolled students. History=Beginnings= Although certain academies (notably of philosophy and theology) were established as Jesuit higher education in what is now Slovenia as early as the seventeenth century, the first university was founded in 1810 under the √âcoles centrales of the French imperial administration of the Illyrian provinces. The chancellor of the university in Ljubljana during the French period was Joseph Walland (a.k.a. , 1763‚Äì1834), born in Upper Carniola. That university was disbanded in 1813, when Austria regained territorial control and reestablished the Imperial Royal Lyceum of Ljubljana as a higher-education institution. =Quest for a national university= During the second half of the 19th century, several political claims for the establishment of a Slovene-language university in Ljubljana were made. They gained momentum in the fin de si√®cle era, when a considerable number of renowned Slovene academians worked throughout Central Europe, while ever more numerous Slovenian students were enrolled in foreign-language universities of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, particularly in the Austrian and Czech lands. Notable examples are the Charles University in Prague and the University of Olomouc, the latter of which Slovene philosopher Franc Samuel Karpe became the chancellor of in 1781. In the 1890s, a unified board for the establishment of a Slovenian university was founded, with Ivan Hribar, Henrik Tuma, and Ale≈° U≈°eniƒçnik as its main leaders. In 1898, the Carniolan regional parliament established a scholarship for all students who were planning a habilitation under the condition that they would accept a post at Ljubljana University when founded. In this way, a list of suitable members of faculty started to emerge. Nevertheless, unfavorable political circumstances prevented the establishment of the university until the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the establishment of the short-lived State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in 1918, the founding of the university became possible. On November 23, 1918, the first meeting of the Founding Board of Ljubljana University was called, presided over by Mihajlo Rostohar, professor of psychology at the Charles University in Prague. Together with Danilo Majaron, Rostohar convinced the central government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in Belgrade to pass a bill formally establishing the university. The bill was passed on July 2, 1919; in late August, the first professors were appointed, and on September 18, the full professors established the University Council, thus starting the normal functioning of the institution. The first lectures started on December 3 of the same year. =First decades= University administrative building in 1929 In 1919, the university comprised five faculties: law, philosophy, technology, theology and medicine. The seat of the university was in the central Congress Square of Ljubljana in a building that had served as the State Mansion of Carniola from 1902 to 1918. The building was first designed in 1902 by Jan Vladim√≠r Hr√°sk√Ω, and was later remodelled by a Czech architect from Vienna, Josip Hudetz. In the mid-1920s, the university was renamed the \\"King Alexander University in Ljubljana\\" (Universitas Alexandrina Labacensis) and continued to grow despite financial troubles and constant pressure from Yugoslav governments‚Äô centralist policies. In 1941, Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik's National and University Library was completed, as one of the major infrastructure projects of the university in the interwar period. After the invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, the university continued to function under the Italian and Nazi German occupation, despite numerous problems and interference in its autonomous operation. Several professors were arrested or deported to Nazi concentration camps and large numbers of students joined either the Liberation Front of the Slovenian People or the Slovenian Home Guard. =1945 and later= Following the end of the Second World War, the first and only foreigner elected to hold the office of chancellor was the Czech professor Alois Kr√°l, who had lectured at Faculty of Technical Sciences since 1920 and also held the position of dean thereof four times. After the establishment of Communist Yugoslavia in 1945, the university was again put under political pressure: numerous professors were dismissed, some were arrested and tried, and the theological faculty was excluded from the university. Some of the most brilliant students emigrated. Nevertheless, the university maintained its educational role and regained a limited degree of autonomy from the mid-1950s onward. It suffered a serious setback in autonomy from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s, when some professors were again dismissed by the authorities. In 1979 it was renamed \\"Edvard Kardelj University in Ljubljana\\" after the Communist leader. In 1990, with the fall of Yugoslavia, it was regiven its original name. Organization=Faculties and academies= Academy of Music , the university has 23 faculties and three academies, situated throughout urban Ljubljana: * Academy of Theatre, Radio, Film and Television * Academy of Fine Arts and Design * Academy of Music * Faculty of Administration * Faculty of Architecture * Faculty of Arts * Biotechnical Faculty * Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology * Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geodesy * Faculty of Computer and Information Science * Faculty of Economics * Faculty of Education * Faculty of Electrical Engineering * Faculty of Law * Faculty of Maritime Studies and Transport * Faculty of Mathematics and Physics * Faculty of Mechanical Engineering * Faculty of Medicine * Faculty of Natural Sciences and Engineering * Faculty of Pharmacy * Faculty of Social Sciences * Faculty of Social work * Faculty of Sport * Faculty of Theology * Veterinary Faculty * Faculty of Health Sciences The university was initially located in the centre of Ljubljana where the central university building and the majority of its faculties are located. Later on, some new, modern buildings and a small scale campus were constructed in other parts of the city (Be≈æigrad, Viƒç, Brdo). =Libraries= The University of Ljubljana has two university libraries. The National and University Library of Slovenia is the national library of Slovenia and the university library of the University of Ljubljana. It contains about 1,307,000 books and numerous text, visual and multimedia resources. Another university library is the Central Technological Library, which is also the national library and information hub of natural sciences and technology. There are over 30 libraries at individual faculties, departments, and institutes of the University of Ljubljana. The largest among them are the Central Humanist Library in the field of humanities, the Central Economic Library in the field of economics, the Central Medical Library in the field of medical sciences, and the Libraries of the Biotechnical Faculty in the field of biology and biotechnology. =Gallery= The university operates an art gallery, open since 18 June 2012. Profile The University of Ljubljana practices research in science and the arts, such as the humanities, social sciences, linguistics, arts, medicine, natural sciences and technology. The University of Ljubljana used to house the permanent seat of the International Association for Political Science Students (IAPSS), an international academic group consisting of 10,000 political science graduate and undergraduate students worldwide from 2004 to 2013. In March 2013 the Permanent Seat was relocated to Nijmegen (Netherlands).IAPSS Prominent faculty and alumni Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek is a Slovenian psychoanalytic philosopher, cultural critic, and Hegelian Marxist.

BusSongs.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-15. Distribution and habitat The groundhog prefers open country and the edges of woodland, and is rarely far from a burrow entrance. Marmota monax has a wide geographic range. It is typically found in low-elevation forests, small woodlots, fields, pastures and hedgerows. It constructs dens in well-drained soil, and most have summer and winter dens. Human activity has increased food access and abundance, allowing M. monax to thrive. Survival Groundhogs can climb trees to escape predators In the wild, groundhogs can live up to six years with two or three being average. In captivity, groundhogs reportedly live up to 14 years. Human development, which often produces openings juxtaposed with second growth trees that are incidentally also favored by groundhogs, often ensures that groundhogs in well-developed areas are nearly free of predators, beyond humans (through various forms of pest control or roadkills) or mid-to-large sized dogs.Lehrer, E. W., Schooley, R. L., & Whittington, J. K. (2011). Survival and antipredator behavior of woodchucks (Marmota monax) along an urban‚Äìagricultural gradient. Canadian Journal of Zoology, 90(1), 12-21. Wild predators of adult groundhogs in most of eastern North America include coyotes, badgers, bobcats and foxes (largely only red fox). Many of these predators are successful stealth stalkers so can catch groundhogs by surprise before the large rodents can escape to their burrows; badgers likely hunt them by digging them out from their burrows. Coyotes in particular are sizable enough to overpower any groundhog, with the latter being the third most significant prey species per a statewide study in Pennsylvania.Witmer, G. W., Pipas, M.

Golden eagles can also prey on adult groundhogs, but this seldom occurs in the range of this marmot.

Young groundhogs (usually those less than a couple months in age) may also be taken by an American mink, perhaps other smallish mustelids, cats, timber rattlesnakes and hawks. Red-tailed hawks can take groundhogs at least of up to the size of yearling juveniles, and northern goshawks can take them up to perhaps weak emergent-adult groundhogs in the Spring.Becker, T.

Beyond their large size, groundhogs have several successful anti-predator behaviors, usually retreating to the safety of their burrow which most predators will not attempt to enter, but also being ready to fight any of those who press the attack off with their sharp claws and large incisors. They can also scale trees to escape a threat.Beer, Encyclopedia of North American Mammals: An Essential Guide to Mammals of North America. Thunder Bay Press (2004), .Watson, E. L. (2010).

Occasionally, woodchucks may suffer from parasitism and a woodchuck may die from infestation or from bacteria transmitted by vectors.The Wild Mammals of Wisconsin, Charles A. Long, p 162, In areas of intensive agriculture and the dairying regions of the state of Wisconsin, particularly the southern parts thereof, the woodchuck by 1950 had been almost extirpated. Jackson (1961) suggested that, although the amount of damage done by the woodchuck had been exaggerated, the excessive persecution by people pursuant thereto had substantially reduced its numbers in Wisconsin. In some areas marmots are important game animals and are killed regularly for sport, food, or fur.

Despite their heavy-bodied appearance, groundhogs are accomplished swimmers and occasionally climb trees when escaping predators or when they want to survey their surroundings. They prefer to retreat to their burrows when threatened; if the burrow is invaded, the groundhog tenaciously defends itself with its two large incisors and front claws. Groundhogs are generally agonistic and territorial among their own species and may skirmish to establish dominance. Outside their burrow, individuals are alert when not actively feeding. It is common to see one or more nearly-motionless individuals standing erect on their hind feet watching for danger. When alarmed, they use a high-pitched whistle to warn the rest of the colony, hence the name \\"whistle-pig\\".Hinterland Who's Who (\\"Canadian Wildlife Service: Mammals: Woodchuck\\"). Hww.ca.

David P. Barash wrote he witnessed only two occasions of upright play- fighting among woodchucks and that the upright posture of play-fighting involves sustained physical contact between individuals and may require a degree of social tolerance virtually unknown in M. monax. He said it was possible to conclude, alternatively, that upright play-fighting is part of the woodchuck's behavioral repertory but rarely shown because of physical spacing and/or low social tolerance.Marmots, Social Behavior and Biology, 1989, David P. Barash, Stanford University Press, p. 97. alt= =Diet= Mostly herbivorous, groundhogs eat primarily wild grasses and other vegetation, including berries and agricultural crops, when available. In early spring, dandelion and coltsfoot are important groundhog food items. Some additional foods include sheep sorrel, timothy-grass, buttercup, tearthumb, agrimony, red and black raspberries, mulberries, buckwheat, plantain, wild lettuce, all varieties of clover, and alfalfa.Schoonmaker, W. J. (1966) The World of the Woodchuck, p. 93 Groundhogs also occasionally eat grubs, grasshoppers, insects, snails and other small animals, but are not as omnivorous as many other Sciuridae. Groundhogs will occasionally eat baby birds they come upon by accident.Canadian Wildlife Federation, Groundhog An adult groundhog can eat more than a pound of vegetation daily.DNR, Indiana Department of Natural Resources, Groundhog In early June, woodchucks' metabolism slows, and while their food intake decreases, their weight increases by as much as 100% as they produce fat deposits to sustain them during hibernation and late winter.Woodchucks Are in the Lab, but Their Body Clocks Are Wild, The New York Times, Les Line, January 29, 1997 Instead of storing food, groundhogs stuff themselves to survive the winter without eating.Discovery Nature Encyclopedia, Groundhog Thought not to drink water, groundhogs are reported to obtain needed liquids from the juices of food-plants, aided by their sprinkling with rain or dew.Schoonmaker, W.

W. J. Schoonmaker excavated 11 dens finding the earth removed from these averaged six cubic feet or four and eight-tenths bushels per den. The longest burrow was 24 feet plus 2 short side galleries. The amount of soil taken from this den was eight bushels and it weighed 640 pounds. The average weight of the earth taken from all eleven dens was 384 pounds.Schoonmaker, W. J., The World of the Woodchuck p. 108-109 Though groundhogs are the most solitary of the marmots, several individuals may occupy the same burrow. Groundhog burrows usually have two to five entrances, providing groundhogs their primary means of escape from predators. Burrows can pose a serious threat to agricultural and residential development by damaging farm machinery and even undermining building foundations. In a June 7, 2009, Humane Society of the United States article, \\"How to Humanely Chuck a Woodchuck Out of Your Yard\\", John Griffin, director of Humane Wildlife Services, stated you would have to have a lot of woodchucks working over a lot of years to create tunnel systems that would pose any risk to a structure. Groundhog with mouthful of burrow material The burrow is used for safety, retreat in bad weather, hibernating, sleeping, love nest, and nursery. In addition to the nest, there is an excrement chamber. The hibernation or nest chamber is lined with dead leaves and dried grasses. Kwiecinski, G. (1998). Marmota monax. Mammalian Species, (591) pg 6 doi:10.2307/3504364 The nest chamber may be about twenty inches to three feet below ground surface. It is about sixteen inches wide and fourteen inches high. There are typically two burrow openings or holes. One is the main entrance, the other a spy hole. Description of the length of the burrow often includes side galleries. Excluding side galleries, Schoonmaker reports the longest was twenty-four feet, and the average length of eleven dens was fourteen feet.Schoonmaker, W. J., The World of the Woodchuck, p. 104-105 W. H. Fisher investigated nine burrows, finding the deepest point forty-nine inches down. The longest, including side galleries, was forty-seven feet, eleven and one half inches.Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 306 Numbers of burrows per individual groundhog decrease with urbanization.Effects of Urbanization on Survival Rates, Anti-Predator Behavior, and Movements of Woodchucks (Marmota monax), Elizabeth L.

Whittington Bachman mentioned that when the young groundhogs are a few months old, they prepare for separation, digging a number of holes in the area of their early home. Some of these holes were only a few feet deep and never occupied but the numerous burrows gave the impression that groundhogs live in communities.Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 318 =Hibernation= Groundhogs are one of the few species that enter into true hibernation, and often build a separate \\"winter burrow\\" for this purpose. This burrow is usually in a wooded or brushy area and is dug below the frost line and remains at a stable temperature well above freezing during the winter months. In most areas, groundhogs hibernate from October to March or April, but in more temperate areas, they may hibernate as little as three months.Woodchucks in Rhode Island . (PDF) dem.ri.gov.

One litter is produced annually, usually containing two to six blind, hairless and helpless young. Groundhog mothers introduce their young to the wild once their fur is grown in and they can see. At this time, if at all, the father groundhog comes back to the family.Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, Volume IV. Doubleday, Doran & Company.

They will eat many commonly grown vegetables, and their burrows can undermine foundations. Very often the dens of groundhogs provide homes for other animals including skunks, red foxes, and cottontail rabbits. The fox and skunk feed upon field mice, grasshoppers, beetles and other creatures that destroy farm crops. In aiding these animals, the groundhog indirectly helps the farmer. In addition to providing homes for itself and other animals, the groundhog aids in soil improvement by bringing subsoil to the surface. The groundhog is also a valuable game animal and is considered a difficult sport when hunted in a fair manner.Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, pp. 129‚Äì131 In some parts of the U.S., they have been eaten. A report in 1883 by the New Hampshire Legislative Woodchuck Committee describes the groundhog's objectionable character:Seton, Ernest Thompson, Lives of Game Animals, p. 328 The committee concludes that \\"a small bounty will prove of incalculable good; at all events, even as an experiment, it is certainly worth trying; therefore your committee would respectfully recommend that the accompanying bill be passed.\\"Schoonmaker, W.J., The World of the Woodchuck, 1966, p. 133 Groundhogs may be raised in captivity, but their aggressive nature can pose problems.

The 1993 comedy film Groundhog Day references several events related to Groundhog Day, and portrays both Punxsutawney Phil himself, and the annual Groundhog Day ceremony. Famous Southern groundhogs include General Beauregard Lee, based at the Dauset Trails Nature Center outside Atlanta, Georgia. Groundhogs are used in medical research on hepatitis B-induced liver cancer. A percentage of the woodchuck population is infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), similar to human hepatitis B virus. Humans do not receive hepatitis from woodchucks with WHV but the virus and its effects on the liver make the woodchuck the best available animal for the study of viral hepatitis in humans. The only other animal model for hepatitis B virus studies is the chimpanzee, an endangered species.Segelken, Roger Cornell (February 1, 1966) \\"At Cornell, groundhog is harbinger of health\\".

The game is designed for 2 or more players and details the battle primarily at the squadron level. The object of the game rests on the shoulders of the Japanese player, who must successfully invade the island of Midway with the heavy cruiser Atago within the time frame of the game. The United States player seeks to prevent this from happening. Components The game is played with two playing boards and counters representing the naval fleets and air forces of the two combatants. =Boards= The two boards used are the search board and the battle board. The bulk of the game takes place on the search board with combat being resolved on the battle board. The search board is actually two identical boards separated by a divider. In this way, the players can see only their own fleet's location and movements, while the opponent's operations remain hidden. The search board is divided by large square zones which are further divided into smaller square spaces. The battle board uses long rectangular spaces to fit the shape of a to-scale ship. =Counters= Counters represent individual ships and squadrons of planes. Each ship actually has two counters, one fitted for the 1/2 inch squares of the search board and a larger one for the rectangular grid of the battle board. The 1/2 inch plane counters are divided into three types: dive bombers, torpedo bombers, and fighters. Gameplay Gameplay in Midway has two distinct segments, corresponding to the two boards: a search segment and a battle segment. =Search= In the search segment, players send out search planes (these are abstract planes and not represented by any counters) to search zones of sea for the enemy fleet. If the zones searched contains enemy ships, the ships' owner must inform his opponent of the exact location, number, and types of ships found there. After the search has been conducted, players can now send out combat squadrons to intercept enemy ships. For each space in which ships and enemy planes now exist, a battle is conducted on the battle board. After all battles are resolved, the squadrons return to their carriers to undergo a turn of refitting. =Battle= When planes successfully intercept an enemy fleet, the combat is resolved on the battle board. The owner of the ships first place their ships on the board in any desired formation he deems most advantageous. The attacker then places his planes around the ships to indicate which squadrons are attacking which ships. Dive bombers must be placed on top the ship being attacked, and torpedo bombers must be placed in the space either to port or starboard of the ship being attacked. The defender then indicates which ships will attack which squadrons. Each ship may attack any squadron within a two space range, not just the one attacking itself. Then through comparison of various factors printed on the counters, and the roll of the die, hits are recorded, and losses are taken. After this one round of combat the ships and planes are removed from the board, and additional combats are resolved, as required.

The Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco mints each produced these 1943 Lincoln cents. The unique composition of the coin (low-grade steel coated with zinc, instead of the previously 95%-copper-based bronze composition) has led to various nicknames, such as wartime cent, steel war penny, and steelie. The 1943 steel cent features the same Victor David Brenner design for the Lincoln cent which had been in use since 1909.  History  Due to wartime needs of copper for use in ammunition and other military equipment during World War II, the United States Mint researched various ways to limit dependence and meet conservation goals on copper usage. After trying out several substitutes (ranging from other metals to plastics) to replace the then-standard bronze alloy, the one-cent coin was minted in zinc-coated steel. This alloy caused the new coins to be magnetic and 13% lighter. They were struck at all three mints: Philadelphia, Denver, and San Francisco. As with the bronze cents, coins from the latter two sites have respectively \\"D\\" and \\"S\\" mintmarks below the date. However, problems began to arise from the mintage. Freshly minted, they were often mistaken for dimes. Magnets in vending machines (which took copper cents) placed to pick up steel slugs also picked up the legitimate steel cents. Because the galvanization process did not cover the edges of the coins, sweat would quickly rust the metal. After public outcry, the Mint developed a process whereby salvaged brass shell casings were augmented with pure copper to produce an alloy close to the 1941‚Äì42 composition. This was used for 1944‚Äì46-dated cents, after which the prewar composition was resumed. Although they continued to circulate into the 1960s, the mint collected large numbers of the 1943 cents and destroyed them. The steel cent is the only regular-issue United States coin that can be picked up with a magnet. The steel cent was also the only coin issued by the United States for circulation that does not contain any copper. (Even U.S. gold coins at various times contained from slightly over 2% copper to an eventual standard 10% copper). Related variations= 1943 copper cent = 1943 copper cent Far ahead of the 1955 doubled die cent in rarity, the 1943 copper cent is one of the notable rarities of the Lincoln cent series. An estimated 40 examples are believed to have been struck, with 13 confirmed to exist. The error occurred when copper planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines during the changeover from copper to steel blanks. Examples were discovered after the War, with the first two in 1947, and another in 1958. That example appeared in a 1958 Abe Kosoff sale, but was withdrawn prior to the sale; one mint condition Denver Mint specimen sold for over $1.7 million in 2010. Many people have counterfeited the coin by either copper- plating normal 1943 cents (sometimes as novelties with no intent to defraud), or altering cents from the period, usually 1945, 1948, or 1949-dated coins. The copper cents differ from their steel counterparts in four ways: * Genuine 1943 copper cents will not be attracted to a magnet. Copper-plated steel cents will exhibit a strong magnetic attraction. * Copper cents weigh 3.11 grams. Steel cents weigh 2.702 grams. * The numeral 3 in 1943 has the same long tail as the steel cents. Alterations from later-dated copper cents will be noticeable when compared side-by-side with genuine cents with years ending in 3. * The quality of the strike is exceptionally sharp, especially around the rim, because the soft copper planchets were struck with the same (higher) pressure used for the steel cents. = 1943 tin cent = left { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" +1943 tin cent composition ! Tin  86.41% - ! Antimony  8.37% - ! Copper  1.75% - ! Vanadium  1.02% } In 2019, the Numismatic Guaranty Corporation authenticated a worn 1943 cent composed of 86.41% tin and 8.37% antimony with other trace metals. The coin was discovered by a coin collector in the state of Oregon, who found it in his father's yard and realized it was not attracted to a magnet while searching his coin collection for 1943 copper cents in 2019. It is likely that the coin is an error or was intentionally struck as a pattern in late 1942 using an obverse die intended for the following year, though no documented evidence of a pattern with this composition has been found. The coin was found in a badly damaged state, with two large gashes and a slight bend. Believing it to be a steel cent, the discoverer straightened the coin in a bench vise so that it would fit inside a coin album. The coin weighs 2.702 g. = 1944 steel cent = 1944 steel cent In an error similar to the 1943 cents, a few 1944 cents were struck on steel planchets left over from 1943. There are two explanations given for why this happened. One explanation is that steel planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines from the previous year mixed in with copper planchets. Another explanation credits the error to the production of 25 million Belgian two franc pieces by the Philadelphia mint after that country's liberation from the Nazis. These coins were of the same composition and the same planchets as the 1943 cents, but they differed slightly in weight. In all, 1944 steel cents are fewer in number than their 1943 copper counterparts, and are even more valuable; one such example minted in San Francisco sold for $373,750 in an August 2008 auction held by Heritage Auctions; this was the highest auction price ever for a Lincoln cent until September 23, 2010, when it was superseded by a 1943-D bronze penny.  Novelty coins  Since many steel cents corroded and became dull soon after entering circulation, some dealers who sold the coins as novelties improved their appearance by \\"reprocessing\\" ‚Äì stripping off the old zinc coating and then replating them with zinc or chrome. These reprocessed coins are sometimes described as brilliant uncirculated, or similar terms, by ignorant or unscrupulous online sellers.
