It is in the Amazon biome. The climate is hot and humid, with two rainy seasons each year. As of 1996 the tropical rainforest habitat was relatively intact, although there were mounting threats from illegal logging and gold mining. Location The Guianan moist forests ecoregion covers most of Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. It covers part of eastern Venezuela and parts of the north of the Brazilian states of Par√° and Amap√°. It has a total area of . Along the Atlantic coast to the east and northeast the ecoregion adjoins strips of Guianan freshwater swamp forests, Amazon-Orinoco-Southern Caribbean mangroves and Orinoco Delta swamp forests. To the northwest it adjoins the Llanos ecoregion, the Guianan piedmont and lowland moist forests and Guianan Highlands moist forest. Scattered patches of this last ecoregion are found on higher ground within the Guianan moist forests ecoregion. To the southwest and in places along its southern border it adjoins large areas of Guianan savanna. Most of the southern border adjoins the Uatuma-Trombetas moist forests. Physical The ecoregion lies to the east of the lower Orinoco basin and covers about 65% of the northeast part of the ancient Guiana Shield. It is bounded to the south by the line of the Acarai and Tumuk Humak mountains, which defines the rim of the Amazon basin and the northern border of Brazil. A small part of the ecoregion in the east is in the lower Amazon basin. The Essequibo, Courantyne, Maroni and Oyapock rivers run through the region to the Atlantic Ocean. The terrain is mostly plains or low hills, with some steep slopes in river valleys and the bases of tepuis. In the west-central area the ecoregion surrounds the Pacaraima Mountains, a sandstone plateau with an average elevation of . It also surrounds tepuis, or tabletop mountains, the highest being Mount Roraima with an elevation of . The highlands and tepuis have a distinct tepui ecosystem. Ecology The Guianan moist forests ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. The ecoregion is part of the Guianan Moist Forests Global Ecoregion, which also includes the Paramaribo swamp forests and the Orinoco Delta swamp forests. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. The northeastern trade winds carry humidity from the Atlantic Ocean, fluctuating annually due to the effects of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (doldrums). Annual rainfall ranges from , with two rainy seasons in December‚ÄìJanuary and May‚ÄìAugust. At a sample location () in the Central Suriname Nature Reserve temperatures vary little throughout the year, slightly warmer in October and slightly cooler in January. Yearly average temperatures are minimum and maximum with a mean of . Annual rainfall is . Monthly rainfall varies from in October to in May. =Flora= The ecoregion is mainly covered by lowland or submontane rainforest, including marsh forest along the rivers. There are an estimated 8,000 vascular plant species, of which half may be endemic. The plant species in the forests change from east to west, with species dominant in one area completely missing from another. There are also patches of savanna, and the coastal lowlands have patches of herbaceous swamp. The flora is diverse. The upper tiers of the forest may reach a height of . The trees are mainly evergreen, but may shed leaves in the dry season. The trees hold many epiphytes and parasites, and shrubs and herbaceous plants cover the forest floor. The main plant families are Bignoniaceae, Bombacaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Moraceae, Sterculiaceae, Lauraceae, Vochysiaceae, Sapotaceae, Lecythidaceae, Fabaceae, Combretaceae, Anacardiaceae, Rubiaceae, Meliaceae, Sapindaceae, Annonaceae and Arecaceae. Common species include Calophyllum brasiliense, Carapa guianensis, Ceiba pentandra, Couroupita guianensis, Eschweilera species, Guarea trichiloides, Luehea species, Parkia pendula, Pentaclethra macroloba, Protium species, Schwartzia species and Trichilia species. Cedrela fissilis, Coumourana punctata, Coumourana punctata and Warszewiczia coccinea are common in some areas but are not found in Suriname. There are centers of plant diversity in the south and in the Sa√ºl region of central French Guiana. The Saul region is a dry belt of semi-open forest and patches of savanna that are more characteristic of the Guayana Lowland province. This region has more than 150 endemic vascular plants, with plants adapted to moderate temperatures in the higher areas and along watercourses. There are many palm species including Astrocaryum mumbaca, Astrocaryum munbaca, Maximiliana maripa, Iriartea excrrhiza and Bactris sphaerocarpa, which is not found in Suriname. The forests contain patches of savanna, particularly in Suriname, which may be remnants of the savanna that covered all of Suriname in the Pleistocene epoch apart from the river valleys and the high-altitude refugia of rainforest. In the early Holocene epoch the climate changed to favor the present rainforest, and remnants of savanna now cover just 1% of Suriname. There are more than 800 species of savanna plants. The Neotropical pygmy squirrel (Sciurillus pusillus) is endemic. =Fauna= More than 220 species of mammals have been identified in Guyana alone, of which more than 100 are bats. Endemic species include rufous mouse opossum (Marmosa lepida), six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus), red-handed tamarin (Saguinus midas), white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), red-faced spider monkey (Ateles paniscus), Neotropical pygmy squirrel (Sciurillus pusillus), delicate pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys delicatus), Guiana bristly mouse (Neacomys guianae), Bahia porcupine (Coendou insidiosus), white-faced spiny tree-rat (Echimys chrysurus), Schultz's round- eared bat (Lophostoma schulzi), and rufous dog-faced bat (Molossops neglectus). Endangered mammals include the black bearded saki (Chiropotes satanas) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). There are many birds species, often the same as in the Guyana Highlands and northern Andes, such as Guianan cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola), or the Amazon lowlands, such as hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin). Raptors include harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis). Endangered birds include the sun parakeet (Aratinga solstitialis) and yellow-bellied seedeater (Sporophila nigricollis). Reptiles include the threatened black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) and yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis). There are diverse amphibians in the families Hylidae, Dendrobatidae and Leptodactylidae. Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". As of 1996 relatively little deforestation had occurred, and conservation efforts were being made, but apart from Suriname there were few conservation areas and rising human pressure on the environment. Guyana is a major exporter of wild birds. The main threats come from illegal gold mining and logging along the unpoliced borders between the Guyanas and Venezuela and Brazil. A mounting drive to promote tourism might motivate the people to preserve the environment as a source of revenue. IUCN protected area category II (National Park) conservation units include the Kaieteur National Park in Guyana and the Brownsberg Nature Park in Suriname. Other protected areas include the Imataca Forest Reserve, Iwokrama Forest Reserve and Raleigh Falls - Voltzberg Nature Reserve.

He is seen as one the fathers of modern botany in Italy.  Early career  He was the son of a physician and a close friend of his fellow citizen Niccol√≤ Tommaseo. After finishing his studies in his hometown and the seminary in Split, he entered in 1817 the University of Padua, from which he graduated in Medicine in 1822. Since he was a boy he had various interests, from literature to science, but his predilection went immediately to botany, at the time considered a branch of medicine: in Padua his interest focused on the local botanical garden, to which he devoted himself as a student. After serving as a university assistant, he returned to Dalmatia in 1827 to work as a doctor (in ≈†ibenik, Drni≈°, Kotor and Budva). At the same time, he maintained a correspondence with his Paduan master, professor Giuseppe Antonio Bonato who during the same years tried to establish the autonomous teaching of botany in the Paduan university. De Visiani wrote of some plants to the director of the \\"Gazzetta Botanica\\" (\\"Botanische Zeitung\\") of Regensburg, and shortly thereafter he was invited to collaborate with the magazine. Between 1828 and 1830 he published the classification and description of over fifty species discovered by him.

Of the 98 people on board, 77 perished in the crash.  Aircraft involved  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Ilyushin Il-18V, registered CCCP-75520 to Aeroflot. In 1963, the aircraft was transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which sent it to the Tashkent Air Division of the Uzbek Civil Aviation Administration. The cabin had a capacity of 89 seats, but 92 passengers were permitted on the aircraft. At the time of the accident the aircraft had 29,443 flight hours and 10,817 pressurization cycles.  Passengers and crew  On board flight 5003 were 92 passengers, of which 4 were children. Six crew members were also aboard the flight, led by pilot in command N. A. Konovalenko (–ù. –ê. –ö–æ–Ω–æ–≤–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∫–æ) and joined by first officer B.V. Polyakov (–ë.–í. –ü–æ–ª—è–∫–æ–≤), flight engineer N.I. Sorokin (–ù. –ò. –°–æ—Ä–æ–∫–∏–Ω), and navigator A.P.

At the time of the accident the weather conditions at Mineralnye Vody Airport were reported to be low-level clouds and fog less than 100 meters above the ground, ice was present on the ground, and visibility ranged between 1020‚Äì1180 meters. The aircraft approached the airport at a heading of 117¬∞. While preparing for landing the crew lowered the flaps and reduced the speed of the aircraft from 290 to 260 km/h; during the approach the crew was distracted monitoring instruments and searching for landmarks, resulting in their failure to notice the flight drifting slightly off course. At 1.5 kilometers from the airport, the pilots realized the deviation and changed the heading to 127¬∞, but the pilot in command realized the landing was impossible and proceeded to go-around for a second approach. The flight, while attempting to disengage the first approach, did not climb 300 meters in a straight line, but instead turned right at 80‚Äì90 meters above the ground, losing altitude; placing it in a 4-5¬∞ roll. The speed of the aircraft reached 270 km/h, and then at an altitude of 120‚Äì130 meters the crew adjusted the flaps too quickly at the same time. The pilot in command pulled the nose up until the aircraft was pitched 11¬∞, which led to an overload of 1.64 gs. The excessive g force damaged the ailerons, rudder, and other control surfaces. The aircraft continued turning to the right despite the crews attempts to adjust the ailerons. In just eight seconds the flight rolled from a heading of 165¬∞ to 205¬∞. The aircraft entered a right bank of 10-30¬∞ Il-18 flew at a heading 102¬∞ towards the airport, to which the pilots attempted to correct; The pilots tried to gain altitude, but at 23:17:44, flying at a speed of 285 km/h at a heading of 216¬∞ and with a left bank of 5-8¬∞, the aircraft hit the ground, damaging a railroad.  Causes  The investigation attributed the accident to crew error. The pilots missed the approach, and when aborting the landing put the aircraft at too sharp angle of attack, causing a stall and damaging the control surfaces.

Around the area are several buildings registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List.  Location  Ko≈õcielecki Square is located in the historical part of Old Bydgoszcz. It has a rectangular shape (√ó), with an east-west orientation, which central part is full of greenery. On the east, it is bordered by Bernardy≈Ñska Street, on the west by Przy Zamczysku street and its southern edge is lined up to the west with D≈Çuga street. The main edifice in the area is Saint Andrew Bobola's Church, standing on the northern edge. The southern side displays a frontage of buildings, among which the ancient Hospital for infants () at No.7, and the former school for girls () both dating back from the beginning of the 20th century. To the west is being constructed a modern business project, ImmobileK3.  History  From the 11th to the 14th century, the area north of the square was occupied by a small city castle, destroyed in July 1330, by the Teutonic Knights. At its place, in accordance with the wishes of Casimir the Great, was built from 1347 to 1360 a royal castle. It played an important defense role during the 15th century Polish-Teutonic War but was pulled down during the 17th century Swedish invasion. From that time until 1895, the place was a wasteland, partly used by inhabitants as gardens. The castle moat, no longer needed, was filled in the 18th century. In 1899, the Prussian authorities began to work on the revitalisation of this area on the eastern outskirts of the Old Town which remained so far out of any city urban planning: * To the east, on the place of the old Protestant temple from the 18th century (disbanded in 1903), was constructed the Municipal Market Hall (today at Podwale Street No.4); * To the south of the castle area was built a new evangelical church (Holy Cross, today Saint Andrew Bobola's parish) on a design by Heinrich Seeling; * Kirchen stra√üe (Church Street, today Teofila Magdzi≈Ñskiego street) was extended to the west, to complete the perspective on the new church; * A new street was created, Wiese Stra√üe (today Przy Zamczysku street) to link Grodzka Street in the north to the square (then Hann-von-Weyhern Platz) to the south; * On the southern side of the square were built two edifices designed by Carl Meyer, the Hospital for infants and the school for girls. In the late 19th-early 20th century, the place was known as the city meat market (). In 1908, the square was planted with four rows of chestnut trees, with carriage alleys on both sides. In 1937, 67 chestnut trees were reported on Ko≈õcielecki Square, while lawns and flower beds were laid in the middle of the square, divided by alleys. From 1935 until the mid 1970s, on Ko≈õcielecki Square was located the main city bus station. After transferring the buses hub to the newly built terminal at Jagiello≈Ñska street (No.58), the area was rebuilt between 1978 and 1980 into a rectangular shape with flower beds. However, the square kept a busy bus traffic from January 1976, with 5 lines (51, 56, 58, 66 and 101) interconnecting there. In August 2015, the former station pavilion was torn down to give way to a new office building project, ImmobileK3, to be delivered in the first quarter of 2018; works started on June 7, 2016. In January 2017, 6 chestnut trees were cut down and removed from the square due to infection. = Naming = In the past, Ko≈õcielecki Square bore the following names: * 1899-1920, Hann von-Weyhern Platz, from Benno Hann von Weyhern (1808-1890), a Prussian cavalry general; * 1920-1939, Plac Ko≈õcieleckich; * 1939-1945, Hann von-Weyhern Platz; * 1945-1949, Plac Ko≈õcieleckich; * 1949-1956, Plac Rewolucji Pa≈∫dziernikowej (Square of the October Revolution); * Since 1956, Plac Ko≈õcieleckich. The current namesake of the square commemorates the Ko≈õcielecki family, whose members had an active role during Bydgoszcz Golden Age (1457-1600), as starosta (e.g. Andrzej Ko≈õcielecki, Stanis≈Çaw Ko≈õcielecki, Miko≈Çaj Ko≈õcielecki).  Main places and buildings  = Tenement at No.4 = 1927-1928 This building was designed to house personnel of close by shelter for poor infants (at No.6), from the director to servants (). In the late 1930s, an additional building has been constructed on the right, close to D≈Çuga street (today at No.5). The building has a terrace surrounded by a balustrade adorned by ornamental urns on its top. The facade displays a nice wrought iron balcony. File:Building at N4.jpgView from the square = Kuyavia-Pomerania Cultural Centre, at No.6 = Registered on Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List (No.723990, Reg. A/1397), December 1, 2008 1908-1909, by Carl Meyer Neo-Gothic The building was erected in 1908, at the initiative of the Patriotic Association of Women (), as an Infant Dispensary. Indeed, in the early 20th century, infant mortality in Bromberg was extremely high (22% in 1928), mostly caused by acute infectious diseases, pneumonia and diarrhea. Hence the urgent need to improve medical care. Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, first wife of Wilhelm II, German Emperor, had appealed for the construction of special homes for young children () in largest cities of Prussia. A special foundation was set up in Bromberg, so as to build an infant hospital with a kitchen for the poor. The municipality donated the plot of land to the foundation, at the time located on Hann von-Weyhern Platz, next to recently constructed School for girls and Evangelical church. Together with the plot assignment, a construction project was realized by architect Carl Meyer. The main donator (60 000 German gold mark), Julius Berger, expressed the wish to have the facility named after the empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein, as Auguste-Viktoria-Heim. Julius was a Jewish property developer and city councillor. On the ground floor stood a kitchen for the poor, with a room for 100 people. On the first floor, there were a nursing home, a small 25-bed hospital with three sick rooms, a glassed veranda, a terrace, a kitchen, a bathroom, a flat for a sister and a nurse. The attic housed a laundry room, a drying room and an auxiliary room. The opening ceremony took place on April 2, 1909, and on July 1, the facility started operating. At the hospital, which soon became known as the Kleinkinder Clinic (Toddler clinic), young infants were coming not only from Bromberg city but also from other regions (e.g. Silesia, Brandenburg). Approximately 130 patients were cared for each year, and the institution soon set up a clinic for young mothers in the premises. During World War I, nursing courses were also organized by city doctors like Elimar Schendell (living at Gda≈Ñska Street 42) and Hermann Dietz (living at Gda≈Ñska Street 88/90). After the war, the need of a separate hospital for infants no longer necessary, its functions were taken over by the pediatric ward of the Provincial Hospital for Infectious Diseases set on Saint Florian Street. The facility on Plac Ko≈õcielecki, managed by Dr. Hermann Dietz, survived until 1926, when the municipal authorities purchased the property from the Deutscher Frauenverein to create there a shelter for young orphans (up to 2 years old) (). Personnel comprised in particular six sisters from the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul, five servants, two schoolgirls and later wet nurses. The shelter welcomed about 140 children each year. In 1939, German forces restored the Infant Dispensary in the building, and just after World War II, the edifice resumed its medical purposes. From 1945 to 1946, there was a Maternity and Children Care Station. Following a couple-of- months occupation by the army, the building became for a few years a residential area. But in 1951, a Special Child Counseling Clinic reopened in the premises, operating till the end of the 20th century within the Central Regional Child Motherhood and Child Health Counseling Center. Since 2000, the building has been housing the Kujawsko-Pomorskie Culture Centre in Bydgoszcz (). In 2014, a thorough renovation has been carried out, including the construction of a new wing, accommodating a spectacle hall. After overhaul, a plaque was set near the main entry to recall the memory of Julius and Flora Berger, main funders of the edifice in the early 20th century. Since 2015, it houses also an amateur and professional art gallery. The facade is characteristic of the Hanover school of architecture which influenced Carl Meyer works.

A/888), June 21, 1993 Neo-Gothic The building was constructed from 1890 to 1892, on a design by architect Carl Meyer. By 1920, it served as the first school for girls ( Erste M√§dchen von Volkschule). In 1921, the building housed a Polish primary school K. Piramowicz. It was a 7-class, primary school, for which headmaster in 1925 was Father Smarzyk, and in 1933 Father Menzel. By 1930, it functioned together with the German, evangelical primary school, located in a wing of the building. In 1933 were created two schools of mixed (girls and boys) pupils. During German occupation, the edifice accommodated for some time a prison, then in 1945 a military hospital. After World War II, it housed primary school No. 8 Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko. With the school No.8 in 2004, and after considering to lodge there city's appeal court, it has been eventually decided to put a Secondary School of Organization and Management. Since 2007, the building also houses the Museum of Freedom and Solidarity in Bydgoszcz. In 2010, the building has been transferred to the ownership of Bydgoszcz's University \\"Casimir the Great\\". The building's architecture is characteristic of 19th century's public buildings in Bydgoszcz, with references to the neo-gothic and Neo-Romanesque. The designer Carl Meyer has been influenced by the Hanover school of architecture, characterized by brick facades and absence of exterior plaster, decorative sculptures and colored surface. Carl Meyer also realised several other edifices in downtown Bydgoszcz, among others: * House at Gdanska Street 60; * House at August Cieszkowski Street No.6; * Bydgoszcz Water supply station, along with architect Marshall. The building has a \\"L\\" shape with wings, two-storey, a basement and an attic. The elevation is divided by pilasters and adorned with brick-made friezes running under the cornice, like dentils. Avant-corps are topped with crow-stepped gable, typical of Carl Meyer's works.

Orientalist Reinhold Rost (1822-1896), headlibrarian to the India Office Library, about 1890 Life He was the son of Christian Friedrich Rost, a Lutheran minister, and his wife Eleonore Glasewald, born at Eisenberg in Saxen-Altenburg on 2 February 1822. He was educated at the Eisenberg gymnasium school, and, after studying under Johann Gustav Stickel and Johann Gildemeister, graduated Ph.D. at the University of Jena in 1847. In the same year he came to England, to act as a teacher in German at the King's School, Canterbury. After four years, on 7 February 1851, he was appointed oriental lecturer at St. Augustine's Missionary College, Canterbury, founded to educate young men for mission work. This post he held for the rest of his life. In London, Rost met Sir Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, and was elected, in December 1863, secretary to the Royal Asiatic Society, a post he held for six years. Through Rawlinson he became on 1 July 1869 librarian at the India Office, on the retirement of FitzEdward Hall, and imposed order on its manuscripts. He secured for students free admission to the library. He retired in 1893 after 24 years of service at the age of 70. His successor as head librarian of the India Office Library became the Orientalist and Sanskritist Charles Henry Tawney (1837-1922). Rost gained many distinctions and awards. He was created Hon.

All four people on board, including two executives of the Hooters restaurant chain, were killed. Kulwicki was being transported from a promotional appearance in Knoxville, Tennessee to the Bristol Motor Speedway for the running of the 1993 Food City 500 on April 4. An investigation determined that the probable cause of the accident was the pilot's failure to operate the engine inlet anti-ice system properly. Accident At 14:21 local time the pilot filed a series of instrument flight plans with the Georgia Automated Flight Service Station at Macon, Georgia. At 20:58 the flight departed McGhee Tyson Airport near Knoxville, Tennessee, on a business flight bound for Tri-Cities Regional Airport at Blountville, Tennessee, with a valid instrument flight clearance. At 21:10 while cruising at 7,000 feet the flight was contacted by Tri-City Airport TRACON and notified to anticipate an instrument landing system (ILS) approach to Runway 23. At 21:28 the pilot reported \\"We are outside the marker\\" and was cleared to land by air traffic control. At 21:29 radio contact between the air traffic controller and the pilot was lost. Following an uncontrolled descent the aircraft impacted the downhill side of a meadow 5.5 miles northeast of the airport, approximately 0.5 miles from the outer marker beacon. The main wreckage of the aircraft came to rest approximately 60 feet from the initial impact point on a heading of 240 degrees. All four people on board were killed in the crash. A post crash fire consumed the cockpit, center section and the left wing. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Fairchild SA227-TT Merlin pressurized, twin turboprop business aircraft, serial number TT-527, and was equipped with Garrett TPE331 engines. The aircraft was issued an FAA airworthiness certificate on 6 September 1985 and registered number N500AK. At the time of the accident the airframe had accumulated 2,294 hours and had its last inspection 50 hours prior. The Fairchild was listed as doing business for Eastern Foods Inc. as a Hooters corporate aircraft and the registered owner/operator was Robert H. Brooks. Crew The pilot and sole crew member was 48-year-old Charlie Campbell, hired by Eastern Foods Inc. on January 27, 1992 as their primary pilot. Campbell held a valid FAA Certificate as an Airline Transport/Commercial pilot and had a total flight time of 19,105 hours including 235 hours in the Fairchild Merlin. Campbell was type rated in the accident aircraft as well as the Beechjet 400 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9. Investigation The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigated the accident and released its report on March 16, 1994. During a post accident interview the air traffic controller stated he had watched the aircraft on final approach until it disappeared from view, then heard a pilot make a radio transmission that he could not understand, then witnessed the aircraft lights in a steep spiral falling from the bottom of the cloud level. The aircraft experienced icing conditions before approaching the airport and radar information showed the aircraft slowed substantially and began a rapid descent before the crash. From examination of the physical evidence it was discovered that neither engine was functioning and that both propellers were feathered at the time of impact. No evidence of any aircraft system failure before the crash was found. The NTSB report stated in part that \\"There was evidence that engine inlet anti-ice annunciator lights were illuminated during impact\\" which lead to the determination that the probable cause of the accident was \\"Failure of the pilot to follow procedures concerning the use of the engine inlet anti- ice system and/or continuous ignition while operating in icing conditions.\\" =Additional information= The NTSB also discovered an operating information letter sent to all owner/operators of aircraft equipped with TPE331 engines by Garrett Engine Division Of Allied Signal in February 1988. The letter outlined instances in which the TPE331 engines had flamed out during icing conditions while descending into warmer air. The engine manufacturer suggested using engine inlet anti-ice whenever moisture is encountered at or below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. In June 1988 Fairchild revised the SA227-TT Merlin flight manual regarding engine flameouts. It instructed that the continuous ignition system was designed to help the engines quickly relight if air or fuel flow is temporarily interrupted and provided a check list to be used if icing conditions were experienced with the icing protection system not turned on. Following the check list, both ignition mode switches would be switched to \\"override heat\\" or continuous ignition. Then the left engine heat switch would be switched to \\"engine & prop heat\\". It should then be determined if the left engine operates satisfactorily before selecting engine and prop heat for the right engine. However, the flight manual does not advise or warn the pilot, in this section, of a possible flameout if the above-mentioned procedures are not followed.

Life Charles was born in Dublin and went to school in Enniskillen before his father died when Charles was twenty. When this happened, he went with his mother to Liverpool, where he found work as a clerk for the Church Missionary Society. He decided to seek new horizons and trained as a lay evangelist with the Society in Reading. In May 1878 he arrived in Zanzibar. His first act was to set up a 300-strong vehicle caravan to the Great Lakes, because he wanted to Christianise Buganda. He was a skilled organizer and increasingly undertook expeditions. In January 1883 he married in the Cathedral of Zanzibar with Ellen Sherratt, one of the nurses who were sent to him by the mission. She gave birth to their daughter Ellen Louise in March 1884, but died a week later. The following year Stokes married again, to an African woman named Limi relative of the chief of the Wanyamwesi, a tribe that supplied many of the bearers in his caravans. This was highly unusual at the time. He also had two African concubines, Nanjala and Zaria, with whom he had two children. He was excommunicated by the Protestant Church and became a trader around central Africa, selling goods such as ivory.Nicholas Harman, Bwana Stokesi and his African Conquests, Jonathan Cape, London, 1986 Stokes was on good terms with the Arabo-Swahili and the British, and since 1890 with the Germans, trading with all of them. In 1894 he went for the first time with a large expedition to north-eastern Congo, with thousands of carriers and large quantities of guns and ivory. The Arabo-Swahili who he was trading with were at war with the Congo Free State at the time and desperately needed weapons. Arrest, trial, execution Through intercepted letters, Captain Hubert-Joseph Lothaire, the commander of the Belgian forces in the region, learned that Stokes was coming to the Congo to trade weapons. He sent Lieutenant Josu√© Henry with 70 men ahead to capture him. Henry took advantage of the absence of a large part of Stokes' caravan, who were scattered in the forest searching for food, and arrested him in his tent (December 1894). He was taken to Lothaire in Lindi, who immediately formed a Drumhead court- martial. Stokes was found guilty of selling guns, gunpowder and detonators to the Belgians' Afro-Arab enemies (Kilonga Longa, Said Abedi and Kibonge). He was sentenced to death and was hanged the next day (hoisted on a tree). The procedure is said to have had many irregularities, including false statements. There was no penal code, no clerk, the verdict was not read, and Stokes did not appeal, although as a citizen he was entitled to. Aftermath In August 1895, the press began to report in detail on this case, including in the Pall Mall Gazette by journalist Lionel Decle. As a result, the case became an international incident, better known as the Stokes Affair. Together, Britain and Germany pressured Belgium to put Lothaire on trial, which they did, in Boma. The Free State paid compensation to the British (150,000 francs) and Germans (100,000 francs) and made it impossible by decree martial or death sentences against Europeans. Stokes's body was returned to his family. In April 1896 the court of Boma acquitted Lothaire after a short trial, in what is considered a questionable verdict. The appeal was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Congo in Brussels in August 1896, paving the way for the rehabilitation of Lothaire. The Stokes Affair mobilized British public opinion against the Congo Free State. It also damaged the reputation of King Leopold II of Belgium as a benevolent despot, which he had cultivated with so much effort. The case helped encourage the foundation of the Congo Reform Association and the annexation of the Congo by the Belgian state in 1908.

These sources constituted the basis for a series of studies about the trade routes of \\"new Christians\\" who returned to Judaism at the end of the 16th century in Livorno in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and from there dispersed to the trade centers of the Ottoman Empire in the Levant and North Africa. This research, among the first to be based on the combination of Rabbinical sources and European sources, unearthed the existence of a Jewish- Portuguese trading diaspora in the Mediterranean, which competed with the national trading companies of Britain and France as though they were supported by their own nation state. Her studies dealing with later periods showed how these trade communities, which were numerically small, influenced the processes of secularization and modernization in Istanbul and Thessaloniki. Between 1987 and 1990, Rozen conducted a large-scale documentation expedition in Turkey, where she documented and photographed 61,000 Jewish gravestones dated 1583‚Äì1900, over 40,000 of them in Istanbul. This digital collection is now being uploaded (2017) to the website of the Goldstein-Goren Diaspora Research Center at Tel Aviv University. This is the largest digital collection of Jewish gravestones in the world. Because the collection documents a societal group that maintained continuity for 450 years, it allows to follow the community's multifaceted history and its relations with the surrounding Ottoman culture. Upon the completion of this documentation project, Rozen incorporated it into an in-depth study of the history of Muslim Ottoman burial culture and art. In a book published in 1994 she showed how from the 17th century, the Jewish community in Istanbul accepted the social, aesthetic, and spiritual values of the surrounding Muslim society. In parallel with documenting the cemeteries, Rozen conducted a far-reaching survey of the protocol books documenting the decisions of the Rabbinical Courts of the Jewish community in Istanbul in the years 1701‚Äì1931. Rozen used these materials, along with the results of the survey of the \\"complaint books\\" (≈ûikayet defterleri) of the Ottoman Empire's subjects against institutions and officials of the Empire, and collections of printed Ottoman sources, to examine the historical processes experienced by the Jewish community in Istanbul. Her studies showed how the Romaniote Greek Jews integrated into the Sephardic Jewish majority, how a society formed that was highly polarized in terms of social class, where most of the capital was concentrated in the hands of the few people who were close to the Sultan's court in various ways, and how the values of the dominating Muslim society were gradually accepted by the Jewish Istanbul community. In 1991, Rozen traveled to Moscow on a mission to locate the archives of the Thessaloniki Jewish community, which had been stolen by Nazi Germany and had reached Moscow with the victorious Red Army. The Russian State Archive permitted Rozen to photocopy the part of the archive that was preserved in the KGB archives, about 250,000 documents, and so far about one quarter of them have been coded into a custom-made computer program. During the work on the documents of this archive, it became apparent that other parts of the community's archives had been scattered over the world, and the part preserved in the Central Archive for the History of the Jewish People in Jerusalem turned out to be particularly large. This archival research uncovered previously unknown aspects of the Thessaloniki Jewish community in the twentieth century. The Thessaloniki Jewish community, known as \\"Jerusalem of the Balkans\\", which was remembered as a city of scholars, international traders, and large industrialists, was revealed as a society whose core during the 19th and 20th centuries were impoverished workers and small artisans living from hand to mouth. Prof. Rozen's students, Dr. Gila Hadar and Dr. Shai Srougo, placed the lives and struggles of the simple Thessaloniki Jews, the female tobacco workers, the port stevedores, and their families on the historiographical agenda. The discovery of these archives led to research in contemporary Greek archives, and to shining a new light upon the annihilation of the Jews of Thessaloniki in 1943 by the Nazis. The few remnants of the community and some of its descendants shifted the blame from Nazi Germany to the community's last Rabbi, Rabbi Zvi Koretz, who died of typhoid fever two weeks after the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where he was imprisoned with his family. The new sources in Rozen's study show how Thessaloniki's transition from the Ottoman Empire to the Greek nation-state in 1912 led to a drop in the community's political status, and a severe decline in the condition of the lower classes. The heads of the community, who were unable to handle the Greek state, took a decision that was unanimous among all the political factions in the city to bring in a Chief Rabbi from outside, after the community had been without such an office-holder for ten years. The chosen Rabbi was Dr. Zvi Koretz, a young man with a PhD in Oriental Studies from Vienna University, who was also a graduate of the Rabbinical Seminar in Berlin. The community's heads hoped that he would know how to deal with the Greeks, which he did, but at the same time he tried to introduce order into the community's convoluted affairs, and acquired many opponents who saw him as an outsider trying to displace them. After the war, when the community's tragedy was revealed in full, Rabbi Koretz became the scapegoat in two ways. The Germans lacked faces and identities, and it was impossible to avenge them, while the memory of the Rabbi and his family was within reach. He was a classic scapegoat: a foreigner, not a Sephardi Jew, and unable to respond. Greek society, too, found him very convenient to condemn. Greek society and the Greek state have trouble to this day in recognizing that during the war the Greek government collaborated with the Germans, and despite the heroic struggle of the communist partisans against the Nazi occupiers, the fate of Thessaloniki's Jews was to them, and particularly to the Christian residents of Thessaloniki, the concern of others rather than part of Greek society. The blaming of Rabbi Koretz clears their conscience to this day, and the minuscule Jewish community remaining in Thessaloniki has had to fall in line with this approach. Deepening the research dealing with Greece's modern history led to a study comparing the Greek diaspora with the Jewish diaspora over the generations, whose results led Rozen to study theories of diaspora and migration, which have interested Rozen during the second decade of the twenty- first century. Teaching During her years of employment at the University of Haifa, Rozen has introduced to the curriculum of the Jewish History Department the teaching of the Ladino culture. She set up the Modern Greek Studies program, and introduced the teaching of the philosophy of history into the School of History at the University of Haifa.

Mikreh Isha) is a 1969 black and white Israeli independent underground experimental dramatic art film, the first Israeli film to be screened at the Venice Film Festival, directed by Jacques Katmor, and, usually, categorized as belonging to the bohemian/counterculture and anarchistic movement. The film was released on DVD by NMC Music. Cinematographer and coscreenwriter Amnon Salomon stated, during an interview, held late in life, that the film's origin is in Katmor's early exhibition, dealing with the female body, and, that no commercial motivations were held by the filmmakers. Synopsis This modernist and non-linear film, influenced by the French New Wave, and, especially, by films such as Jules and Jim and Breathless, tells the story of an advertiser (Yossi Spector), in his forties, who, meets Helit (), a model, in her twenties, and, together, the two spend a day in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, The model leads the advertiser into caf√©s and drug-fueled orgies, while, he leads her into the workshops of sculptors, so, that they could create sculptures, modeled on her body, out of gypsum. While she tries to liberate his mind, he attempts to stay where he is. The film ends with the advertiser strangling Helit to death, during a sadomasochistic session. Reception Maariv compared the film to the works of James Joyce, Jean-Luc Godard, and, Michelangelo Antonioni, with the acting of being compared to that of Monica Vitti, writer Yoram Kaniuk wrote that the film is a critique of the horrors of the modern world, and, Davar compared the film to painting. The film, however, was a commercial failure, with only 38,000 tickets sold, due to its highly avant-garde nature. University of Haifa sociologist, Prof. Dr. , wrote that film's main theme is the independent woman's, unsuccessful, attempt to free the man, from the shackles of his masculinity, and, noted that it was one of the first Israeli films to express their director's personal view.

Born in Magdeburg, Germany as the first child to Jewish parents on March 11, 1914, Kr√ºger grew up taking photographs. As her family fled from rising Nazi sentiment in Germany, Lore Kr√ºger and her camera captured emigration and resistance in a turbulent pre-World War II Europe. She was influenced by Marxism and German Expressionism, such as New Objectivity.  Early Years  Born as Lore Heinemann on March 14, 1914, her father, Ernest Heinemann, was an engineer, and for her tenth birthday, gave her a camera. After her father lost his job at a bank, her parents relocated. Kr√ºger travelled to London, Mallorca, Barcelona, Paris, Marseille, Trinidad, New York, Wisconsin, and Berlin. This was all in escape of Nazi sentiment as well as the second World War. Lore Kr√ºger brought her camera with her and took pictures in all of these places. She became an icon of the emancipated women in the avant-garde movement of the 1930s and 1940s. = Career = Kr√ºger fled Germany in 1933 to move to London. While there, she worked as an au pair. After London, she followed her parents to Mallorca where they had relocated after her father lost his job. Next, she moved to Barcelona where she studied photography with Zerkowitz. The next move was to Paris, where she studied in a Bauhaus studio under Florence Henri. While in France, she practiced her photography and was shown to excel in portraits. She worked to perfect her trade and soon entered into the group of great female photographers of the time. She stood with the anti-Nazi agitators at this time as well. However, Kr√ºger was still a German in France, while France was at war with Germany. She was therefore was considered an enemy. Kr√ºger was sent to an internment camp in 1940 where she stayed for six months. After being released, she fled with her fianc√©, Ernst Kr√ºger, on a ship destined for Mexico. With both Mexican as well as U.S. visas, Kr√ºger, her fianc√©, and her sister, Gisela, hoped to gain refuge in North America. Unfortunately, on the journey, the ship was seized by the Dutch army. The three were placed in a British internment camp outside in Trinidad. After released, Kr√ºger emigrated to New York. Lore Heinemann married Ernst Kr√ºger in New York in 1942. Her and her new husband founded a newspaper called the German-American Newspaper. This was all done while still in exile from Nazi Germany. She worked primarily as an interpreter and translator, but also was a portrait photographer. Kr√ºger and her family returned to Germany after the war in 1946 in hopes it would they would be able to \\"create anew\\" after the war. She worked as a translator of prolific American literature during this time to include the authors Mark Twain, Joseph Conrad, and Henry James. = After death = Kr√ºger's photography career basically ended upon her return to Germany in 1946. Throughout her travels during her exile, she had collected 250 photographs ranging from gypsies to farms to prolific lawyers in New York. Irja Kratke and Cornelia Bastlein viewed her work shortly before Kr√ºger's death, however Kr√ºger was not interested in the publicity of an exhibition. After Kr√ºger's death in 2009, Kratke and Bastlein worked hand in hand with C/O Berlin to be the first institution to exhibit this artist's work.

They are the toughest of the plant fibers which is most likely due to their increased lignin content when compared to the other groups of plant fibers. They are typically characterized as being very tough and rigid lending them towards being used in rope production over clothing or paper like other plant fibers. Leaf fibers can be found in the vascular bundles of plant leaves and therefore consist of both phloem and xylem tissues and any other vascular sheathing tissues (for example sclerenchyma cells). More specifically, leaf fibers are typically found in monocotyledonous leaves. The fibers are harvested from plants in long, thin bundles mainly through the process of decortication which is where the non-fibrous tissues are scraped away from the plant fibers by hand or in a machine. For the majority of cases, the leaves must be hand-picked from the plant at maturity before undergoing decortication which causes the harvesting of hard fibers to be a very energy and time intensive task. Sisal and abaca are the primary leaf fibers that are harvested and sold. These are both mainly used to make rope or matting but, as technology continues to advance these, and other, hard fibers are being able to be broken down and pulped to be used in paper products. Not much research is being looked into the possibilities and abilities of leaf fibers as they are very hard to harvest and process so synthetic fibers are more commonly used in their place.

Early life  Hillinger was born to Jewish parents in the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary, in what was known at that time as the Kingdom of Hungary. He intended to study architecture at the University of Budapest following the completion of his military service during World War I. Due to violent, anti-Semitic demonstrations and subsequent calls for bans on Jewish enrolment and the enactment of restrictive legislation curtailing the Jewish student population, Hillinger instead went to Germany and studied architecture at the Technical University of Berlin from 1919 to 1922. He met his Protestant wife, Grete, in Berlin. Until 1924, he mainly designed detached, single-family homes for private owners. His first project was a house for Grete's parents on a rural estate on the outskirts of Berlin.  Neues Bauen  Carl Legien housing estate (constructed 1928-1930) In 1924, Hillinger became head of the design office at the Gemeinn√ºtzige Heimst√§tten-, Spar- und Bau-Aktengesellschaft (GEHAG), a position he held for nearly ten years; there he collaborated on several projects with Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner, who designed buildings for GEHAG as independent architects. Hillinger's most significant achievement from this period is the Carl Legien Estate, a Berlin modernist housing estate in the Prenzlauer Berg subdivision, which he developed for GEHAG between 1928 and 1830 in collaboration with Bruno Taut. In 1925, Hillinger envisioned a model community of in the Neues Bauen style consisting of 1,145 apartments of 1¬Ω to 3¬Ω rooms each, all with central heating, and each with an ample balcony or loggia. An integral part of his concept for this housing estate were several shops, a communal laundry with childcare, a management office, and large open areas and interior courtyards lush with greenery. Hillinger found inspiration for his endeavor in the Tusschendijken housing project in Rotterdam, built in 1920/21 by Jacobus Johannes Pieter Oud; for this reason, the Carl Legien Estate is sometimes referred to as the \\"Flemish Quarter.\\" Because of the Great Depression and the seizure of power by the National Socialists, who rejected the Neues Bauen style, only the first two construction phases were realized according to plan; the third, delayed until the end of the 1930s, was made to conform with the conventional Mietskaserne or rental-barracks style. From 1931 to 1932, Hillinger was also a lecturer in architecture at the Technical University of Berlin as Bruno Taut's assistant.  Exile  With the rise of National Socialism to power in 1933, Hillinger was forced to surrender his position with the GEHAG. In the period immediately following, he worked as an architect only in the underground, designing houses for private owners in Berlin. In 1937, because of his Jewish origins and his membership in the SPD, Hillinger was excluded from the Reichskammer der Bildenden K√ºnste [Reich Chamber of Fine Arts], effectively barred from practicing his profession. Consequently, he emigrated to Turkey in 1937, initially without his family, and joined the German exile community there. His mentor, Bruno Taut, had been living there since 1936, along with a number of prominent exiled architects and city planners. His wife and children were able to join him. His brother, however, perished in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In Turkey, Hillinger was employed as a design architect for the Building Department of the Ministry of Culture, and he began to hold lectures at the Academy of Fine Arts (today Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University) in Istanbul. From 1940 to 1943 he was head of the School of Architecture in Ankara. After the death of Bruno Taut in 1938, Hillinger worked with Taut's staff to complete several works in progress. In 1948, Hillinger's wife and children emigrated to the United States permanently. In 1951, Hillinger traveled to Canada and from there unsuccessfully tried to enter the United States for the first time. From 1953 to 1956, he was in Ankara supervising construction of the new Parliament building, started in 1939 based on a design by the Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister.

It was led by the marine biologist Carl Chun and the expedition ran from 1898-1899 with the purpose of exploring the depths of the oceans below 500 fathoms, which had not been explored by the earlier Challenger Expedition. The Challenger Expedition was the expedition that established modern Oceanography, prompting many other expeditions, nationally or privately funded, which would dredge the deep-sea in search of new and exotic species. This late 19th Century fascination with organisms found at great depths was unsurprising, because in the mid-19th century most scientists followed Abyssal Theory which stated that it was not possible for life to exist below 300 fathoms depth. Carl Chun, a famed teuthologist, held a deep conviction that there must be life, in abundance, which existed in the unknown abyssal regions of the oceans, a belief he shared with an increasingly large number of marine scientists. This conviction along with his desire to further explore the areas of the oceans which were not covered by the Challenger Expedition that led him to propose that the German Empire organise its own expedition which was to be nationally funded with the approval of the Kaiser. SS Valdivia thumb Conception and preparation Chun proposed to the Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und √Ñrzte (Society of German Naturalists and Doctors ), which was the German equivalent of the Royal Society, that a German deep sea expedition be funded and equipped to explore the deep oceans. His proposal was well received and a resolution to approve the plan and recommend it to the German government was unanimously adopted on 24 September 1897. It was originally conceived as purely zoological expedition but Friedrich Ratzel suggested that chemical and physical observations be included in the expedition's remit and this was accepted. The German government approved the proposal and granted the expedition 300,000 marks in initial funding with promises of further grants to cover the expenses of the expedition and the publication costs of its findings. The ship, the SS Valdivia, was chartered from the Hamburg-Amerikanischen Packetfahrt-Actien- Gesellschaft (HAPAG), which fitted the ship out with equipment such as dredging gear, specimen jars, deep sea traps and oceanographic equipment, also outfitting the laboratories, while also providing the crew and provisions, all for a sum equivalent to ¬£17,000, a sum which covered the company's expenses but did not allow for any profit. Chun was the overall leader of the expedition. A captain of whaling ships, Adalbert Krech, was appointed the ship's captain while the navigator was Walter Sachse who was an employee of HAPAG's. The scientific staff was made up of the botanist Professor W. Schimper of Bonn, the zoologists Carl Apstein, Ernst Vanh√∂ffen and Fritz Braem, the oceanographer Gerhardt Schott, the chemist Paul Schmidt and Dr M. Bathman who was a bacteriologist and the ship's doctor, who died on the voyage. August Brauer and Otto zur Strassen who were zoologists by profession and Fritz Winter who was an artist and photographer, but these had no official status recorded. Adalbert Krech 1898 The Voyage Map of the route taken by the Valdivia Expedition The Valdivia set sail from Hamburg on 1 August 1898 and made its first call into the harbour of Granton, Edinburgh, where the scientists visited the offices of The Challenger Expedition Commission and were entertained by Sir John Murray. The expedition then sailed north, entering the Atlantic between the Faroe Islands and the Shetland Islands and then turning south towards the Canary Islands and the west coast of Africa, reaching Cape Town on 26 August. They then explored a major part of the Indian Ocean and the Antarctic Ocean, covering a total of 32,000 nautical miles. The Valdivia was among the Antarctic ice for almost four weeks in November and December 1898 in the sea between Bouvet Island, which was rediscovered by the expedition, and Enderby Land. During this time the crew observed around 180 icebergs many of which they sketched and photographed, however as the Valdivia was an ordinary steel hulled vessel the ship had to remain clear of the pack ice. As well as the biological, geological and geographic findings the expedition was also able to make significant meteorological observations. The Valdivia returned to Hamburg on 30 April 1899. Publication of results The main aims of the expedition were to collect as many biological specimens as they could while focussing on how organisms adapted to the extreme conditions of the environment of the deep oceans. One result of this was that a number anatomical studies of light organs were carried out. One of the best known publications is Volume 15: Die Tiefsee-Fische by Brauer which has an editorial review by Chun consisting of a systematic and anatomical study of the deep sea fish specimens they collected on their voyage aboard the Valvidia which were illustrated by Friedrich Wilhelm Winter. Winter's illustrations make it clear that these deep sea fish are heavily reliant on senses other than their vision. Many are bioluminescent and in numbers these animals have the effect of making the deep, dark sea look like a night sky filled with stars. The expeditions findings took 4 decades to be published, and they were published in 24 volumes as Wissenschaftliche Ergebnisse der Deutschen Tiefsee-Expedition auf dem Dampfer \\"Valdivia\\" 1898‚Äì1899 (Scientific results of the German deep- sea expedition on the steamer \\"Valdivia\\" 1898‚Äì1899). Another much admired volume is Chun's own Die Cephalopoden in which Chun describes the vampire squid Vampyroteuthis infernalis the scientific name meaning \\"the vampire squid from hell\\".

At the end of the 19th century, the area underwent massive industrialization becoming the first industrial part of Bratislava. In the 1950s to 1970s, the area was redeveloped into a residential suburb. At the end of the 20th century large-scale construction of office buildings started again to change the character of the neighborhood and in the 21st century, Nivy became the location of the emerging new city centre of Bratislava. It is an important transport hub featuring the Bratislava Central Bus Station.

It stars Aaron Poole, Kenneth Welsh, Daniel Fathers, Kathleen Munroe, and Ellen Wong. The plot follows a small group of people who become trapped in a hospital by a gathering of hooded cultists, and by grotesque creatures. The creature effects were crowdfunded on Indiegogo and raised $82,510, while the film's funding was done through traditional channels by the production company. It premiered at the 2016 Fantastic Fest and later at the Toronto After Dark Film Festival. The film was given a limited theatrical release on May 21, 2017 in the United Kingdom and the United States, and on April 17 in Canada, initially opening in 31 theaters before expanding to 50. It earned approximately $55,000 on its opening weekend, and grossed $149,365 during its release. The Void received positive reviews from critics, with many citing comparison to horror films from the 1980s. Plot James flees from a farmhouse and escapes into the woods. A screaming woman tries to follow, but is wounded by a gunshot. Lying on the ground, she is doused with gasoline and set on fire by Vincent and Simon. Deputy Sheriff Daniel Carter is on duty, sitting in his patrol car when he finds James crawling along the road and rushes him to the local hospital, which has been largely abandoned following a fire, where his estranged wife Allison Fraser works as a nurse. At the hospital are Dr. Richard Powell, nurse Beverly, intern Kim, pregnant patient Maggie, her grandfather Ben, and patient Cliff; with the staff at the hospital working as a skeleton crew. Daniel discovers an entranced Beverly murdering Cliff, her face flayed of skin. Beverly moves toward Daniel who shoots her dead. Daniel collapses due to a seizure and experiences a strange vision. State trooper Mitchell enters the hospital to collect James after discovering the bloody scene at the farmhouse. Daniel goes outside to call in Beverly's death from his patrol car, but is confronted by a robed cultist who wounds him. He manages to return to the hospital as cultists surround the building. James, Daniel and Mitchell find Beverly's corpse has transformed into a tentacled creature. Vincent and Simon enter the lobby and hold the group at gunpoint, demanding to get to James. James takes Maggie hostage to protect himself and stabs Powell, who falls to the floor. The Beverly-Creature appears and takes Mitchell, its tentacles penetrating his body. Vincent and Simon kill the Beverly-Creature and regroup with the others in the lobby, setting Mitchell's body on fire. Vincent and Simon accompany Daniel to retrieve a shotgun from a patrol car, while Allison ventures into the basement to collect medical supplies for delivering Maggie's baby. Powell manages to capture Allison. Daniel and Vincent go to search for her and find photographs and files indicating Powell was the cult's leader. Powell phones Daniel, taunting him and mentioning the vision Daniel experienced while unconscious. Kim and Ben stay with Maggie while Daniel, Vincent, and Simon interrogate James. James explains that Powell has the power to transform people. The three men force James to come with them downstairs. Allison regains consciousness on an operating table where Powell explains he has found a way to defy death after the loss of his daughter Sarah. Having flayed off his face, Powell shows Allison that something now grows inside her. Daniel, Vincent, Simon, and James find a hidden area in the basement and end up surrounded by deformed corpses brought back to life. One of the creatures kills James as the other three men get separated. As Maggie enters labor, Kim hesitates to perform a C-section. As Ben pleads with Kim, Maggie stands and slits his throat, revealing she is carrying Dr. Powell's child. Kim hides as cultists enter the building and Maggie leaves. Daniel finds Allison in the operating room pregnant. He sees a tentacled creature extending from her body. Powell's voice speaks to Daniel, who attacks his wife's mutated remains with an axe. Daniel is transported to a morgue room with a glowing triangle on the wall. Powell's voice tells Daniel that he found the ability to conquer life and death. Powell promises that Daniel can have his child back if he is willing to die first. Maggie appears and stabs Daniel. Powell appears skinless and partly mutated in front of the triangle as Maggie kneels before him. Powell recites an incantation before the triangle as a now frightened Maggie's torso explodes, birthing the Sarah- Creature. Vincent and Simon arrive and battle it. The Sarah-Creature overcomes Vincent, but he covers it in isopropyl alcohol, allowing Simon to set them both on fire with a flare. Powell tells Daniel he can be with Allison if he stops resisting and \\"lets go\\". Daniel refuses and tackles him, leading both men to tumble into the void. Meanwhile, the Sarah-Creature pursues Simon, who escapes and is teleported back to the hospital to reunite safely with Kim. Daniel and Allison are shown holding hands in another world beneath a black pyramid.

Their films included Manborg, Father's Day and The Editor. The Void differed from the previous films being serious in tone, which led the group to not present it under the Astron-6 name. Jeremy Gillespie was initially working at Pinewood on a floor below where Guillermo del Toro was working on the unfinished film At the Mountains of Madness, recalling hearing him state that he wanted to do a HP Lovecraft film in a way that hadn't been done before. After hearing this, Gillespie felt that this \\"sort of got the wheels in my mind working, trying to think of what that might be. So that was sort of where the imagery was birthed. All of this stuff relating to pyramids and triangles is left ambiguous, for the audience to interpret as they would, intentionally.\\" Gillespie and Kostanski managed to crowdfund the money they needed to build the practical creatures that appear onscreen effects. Other assistance came from the team working on David Ayer's Suicide Squad which was shooting in Toronto. Gillespie served as assistant art director and Kostanski as a special makeup effects artist on the film, which led to members of the special effects team on Suicide Squad to work on The Void. Gillespie later declared The Void as a difficult production, noting that \\"Every single thing was the biggest challenge. It was a soul-crushing nightmare. Everybody was pushed to the limit on this movie. The one ray of hope we got was the cast, which came together at the last second. They were easy to deal with.\\" The Void was set to shoot in Canada on November 17, 2015. At the American Film Market, XYZ Films and CAA were set to handle the North American deals. Release The Void had its world premiere at Fantastic Fest on September 22, 2016. The film received its Canadian premiere at Toronto After Dark Film Festival on October 17. Screen Media Films negotiated the deal with XYZ Films and CAA for both theatrical and video on demand day-and-date release of The Void in the United States on April 7, 2017. The Void opened in Winnipeg on March 31, Toronto on April 1, Ottawa and Calgary on April 7 and Vancouver on April 8 where it was distributed by D Films. The soundtrack of The Void was released by Death Waltz Recordings on 4 October 2017. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 78% approval rating based on 73 reviews, and an average rating of 6.11/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Void offers a nostalgic rush for fans of low-budget 1980s horror ‚Äî and legitimate thrills for hardcore genre enthusiasts of all ages.\\" On Metacritic, The Void received a rating of 62 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Fangoria gave the film a positive review, specifically praising that \\"practical effects are not obscured, not glimpsed partially through a flashing light or a shaky handicam. They‚Äôre showcased front and center, with the confidence of a team that knows their monsters have more weight and impact than the myriad CGI scares that have become the standard in modern horror.\\" and that it was a film that \\"demands multiple viewings.\\" Kim Newman of Screen Daily compared the film to previous works Bio-Cop from ABCs of Death 2 and Manborg, stating that the directors \\"remain in pastiche mode, but tone down the humour to try for serious suspense and Lovecraftian horror - with a pleasing reliance on memorably gruesome physical effects rather than CGI.\\" Newman concluded that the film \\"offers good shock/uck moments and a nicely unpredictable plot, even if a few crucial relationships are sketchily established, slightly undermining audience investment in the horrors.\\" Empire gave the film a 3 stars out of 5, stating that the \\"central story hinges on a series of outlandish coincidences, too many of the cast of characters struggle to make an impact, and the pacing is a tad too ponderous to really grip.\\" The review found that as the film became more close to a creature feature, \\"the directors‚Äô love of old-school, honest-to-goodness, practical FX is a huge boon\\" and the directors are \\"worth keeping an eye on\\", as they \\"know their way around an arresting image, whether it‚Äôs a group of masked figures eerily lit by the cold, flashing light of a cop car, or a killer nonchalantly sliding a scalpel into someone‚Äôs eye\\". The Globe and Mail gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, calling the plot \\"hard to follow\\" and that the creatures in the film \\"are low-lit, which probably has more to do with budget realities than aesthetic choice\\" and that the film was \\"unsettling and not jokey at all, the hell of The Void will be heaven to some.\\" Now found that the directors were still \\"operating in their referential comfort zone\\" with the film being \\"a savvy mashup of at least four John Carpenter pictures.\\" and that it was still \\"its own entity: an effective, resourceful nightmare that convinces you the apocalypse is clawing just out of sight, beyond the edge of the screen.\\" Giving the film 1.5 stars out of 5, Simon Abrams was disappointed with a film he thought he should like. Calling the plot \\"wafer- thin\\", and the style \\"patchy and flimsy\\", and \\"a work by a group of young, unformed voices.\\" See also * List of Canadian films of 2016 * List of horror films of 2016 Notes External links * The Void at Indiegogo  2016 films 2016 horror films 2010s supernatural films English-language films Crowdfunded films Indiegogo projects Canadian films Canadian supernatural horror films Films based on works by H.

Early and family life Giesen was born in Radford, Virginia on August 8, 1932 to Arthur Rossa Giesen and his wife Charlotte Caldwall Giesen during the Great Depression. He attended Yale University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1954. He then went on to earn his MBA from Harvard Business School in 1956. Both of his parents served on the Radford city council, with his father serving as Radford's mayor for a time. During the Massive Resistance crisis, the Democratic Byrd Organization proposed the closure of Virginia's public schools in an effort to prevent racial desegregation required by the United States Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Giesen's mother was editor of the Women's page in the local newspaper, ran against the incumbent Byrd Democrat, and won election to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1958. Pete Giesen married Dorthy, with whom he had three sons and three daughters, but later divorced her and married Patricia Elliot.Bruce F.

He later formed the New Options Group, Inc. in Waynesboro, Virginia and served on the executive boards of both the Augusta Steel Corporation and the Virginia- Central Valley Bank (that merged into Crestar Bank). Active in his Lutheran Church, he served on the national executive council from 1978 to 1982 as well as helped found the Innsbrook Kiwanis Club in 1990 (having previously been a member of the Verona Kiwanis Club).1981 published legislative bio He continued the family's political tradition by running for the Virginia House of Delegates as a Republican in 1961 to represent Waynesboro, but initially came in third in a two-member district. Two years later, in 1963, he came in second, since Democrat Felix E. Edmunds, who had come in second the previous election (and had only lost in 1955 because the district had briefly become a single-candidate one), had decided to concentrate on his legal practice. While Giesen still couldn't outpoll Democrat George M. Cochran (who had bucked the Byrd Machine during Massive Resistance), he did outpoll Harry L. Nash Jr. and was seated in the House of Delegates. Voters re-elected Giesen multiple times.Cynthia Miller Leonard, General Assembly of Virginia 1619‚Äì1978 (Richmond, Virginia State Library 1978) pp. 735, 740, 746, 752, 758, 765, 772 Initially Waynesboro area voters elected Giesen from what was numbered the 10th District, but which became the 15th after the 1970 census reapportionment, and was briefly the 10th district again in 1981, but finally became the 25th district. Giesen had risen to assistant minority leader and then minority leader. On September 11, 1974, he resigned his House seat and leadership position, hoping to win the special election to succeed H. Dunlop Dawbarn in the state senate. Thanks in part to another redistricting and the Watergate Scandal, which led to the Democratic landslide of 1974, engineer Frank W. Nolen defeated Giesen by 405 votes. Giesen subsequently ran successfully for his old House seat in 1975. He served during most of the 1970s with Bath County's former Commonwealth attorney, Democrat Erwin S. Solomon, in a two-member district. Giesen handily defeated Democrat Thomas E. Roberts in 1985, and faced no opposition in 1982, 1983, 1987, 1991 or 1993 as his district became the 25th (and Solomon remained in the single-member 15th).

They initiated Czech national program, forming of modern national through Czech National Revival and better position of Bohemia within the Habsburg Monarchy. An important event in the history of the party were split of Young Czech wing of the party, in 1874 formed Young Czech Party led by Karel Sladkovsk√Ω.Garver, Bruce M.: \\"The Young Czech Party 1874-1901 and the emergence of a multi-party system.\\", Yale University Press., 1978  Background  The 1848 Revolutions, starting in Sicily before spreading to the rest of Europe, led to the formation of the first Czech political parties in the Austrian Empire. Upon the resignation of State Chancellor Klemens von Metternich, the new Austrian government under Prime Minister Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky finally ceded to the provisional Bohemian \\"national assembly\\" (Svatov√°clavsk√Ω v√Ωbor roku 1848) the right to hold elections for a Landtag parliament in the Lands of the Bohemian Crown. Though initially backed by the Austrian governor Count Leopold von Thun und Hohenstein, the attempt failed due to disagreement with Moravian and Austrian Silesian representatives as well as the resistance of the German-speaking minority. In June 1848 the Prague Slavic Congress, led by the historian Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, who had rejected his mandate to the Frankfurt Parliament, demanded a federation of the Austrian states and the withdrawal from the German Confederation. The succeeding \\"Whitsun Riot\\" from 12 to 17 June 1848 aimed at the independence of the \\"Czech lands\\" of Bohemia, Moravia and Austrian Silesia, similar to the Hungarian Revolution; it was crushed by Austrian troops under Field Marshal Prince Alfred I of Windisch-Gr√§tz. The Czech people were given a taste of freedom of assembly and government only to experience defeat, which was completed with the failed Vienna Uprising and the dissolution of the Kremsier Parliament in 1849. Despite this defeat and its implications, the 1848 experience boosted ethnic nationalism in the Habsburg lands, and activists looked upon the Czech National Revival with pride. 450pxthumbrightLanguages in northern Austria-Hungary according to 1910 census As a result of the failed revolution, in 1851 the decreed March Constitution was abolished and a non- constitutional system was put in place under Interior Minister Baron Alexander von Bach, deemed \\"Bachist neo-absolutism\\".Frantisek Kavka, An Outline of Czechoslovak History (Prague: Orbis, 1960) After the defeat of Austira in the Second Italian War of Independence in 1859 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria was forced to revoke absolutist policies i an attempt to pacify internal dissent by means of the October Diploma which included the implementation of an Imperial Council parliament. Immediately, a Czech National Party (N√°rodn√≠ strana, \\"Old Czech\\" party) was formed under the guidance of Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω and his son-in-law, Franti≈°ek Ladislav Rieger. The National Party sought to achieve a large measure of political and cultural autonomy for the Czech people within a federated Austria. The February Patent of 1861 from Interior Minister Anton von Schmerling marked an abrupt reversion to centralized ideas applied to the Czech lands. Imperial recognition of an autonomous Bohemian kingdom did not come to pass despite continued efforts by the National Party to receive formal recognition of their autonomy. Nationalities assigned to second class status by the constitutional arrangements of the monarchy in the 1860s could do no more than work for reform within the oppressive and bureaucratic framework of the dual monarchy. Action was dependent on the occurrence of another international crisis which would compel the Habsburgs to initiate real reform and liberalize the constitution. This state of inaction proved to be a long struggle by the Czechs against the authoritarian Habsburg Empire.  Emergence  By 1863, two clearly defined factions within the Czech National Party had emerged: the Old Czechs and the Young Czechs. Their major areas of contention were: the extent to which the party should cooperate with the conservative landowners, how best to define and advance Bohemian state rights, whether or not to passively resist centralization of the monarchy, and their difference of opinion with the Polish insurrection in Russian Poland. The conflict within the National Party that led most directly to the creation of an independent Young Czech Party in 1874 was the issue of passive resistance. The Old Czech faction, under the leadership of Palack√Ω and Rieger, sought to act conservatively against the monarchy through working with the great landowners to achieve greater political influence and by refusing to attend the imperial council (Reichsrat) meetings. The Young Czechs, on the other hand, felt that Czech national interests would be best served by participating actively in all forms of government. Two events in particular display the effects of the Old Czechs' policy of passive resistance and cooperation with the nobility. The war in 1866 between the monarchy and Prussia displayed how the Old Czechs' policy of loyalty and cooperation backfired. With the war, the monarchy sought the financial aid of its lands and Hungary, also seeking imperial recognition of its autonomy, refused to provide assistance as long as their demands for self-government were not fulfilled. Meanwhile, the Czechs remained loyal to the monarchy but due to fear of further disobedience, the monarchy complied with Hungarian demands and created the December Constitution of 1867 which enacted a dual monarchy. Rieger reacted by advocating a boycott of participation in the Reichsrat until the Emperor suspended the February Patent. Further passive action was taken in withdrawing from the Bohemian Diet with the Declaration of 1868 that called for a tripartite monarchy. The Young Czechs reluctantly upheld the party‚Äôs boycott of the Reichsrat but seven young delegates defied the party‚Äôs policy by returning to the Bohemian Diet in September, 1874. This defiance, led by Alois Pravoslav Trojan and Edvard Gr√©gr, heralded the decision to form an independent Young Czech party in December of the same year. The N√°rodn√≠ Listy (National Paper) saluted the ‚Äúseven Maccabees who unsheathed the sword of political activism to defend their homeland‚Äù while the loyal Old Czech newspapers decried ‚Äúthe seven Krauts who carried the national cross to Golgotha.\\" After eight years (1871‚Äì79) of boycotting the Reichsrat in protest against the collapse of a negotiated agreement with Emperor Franz Joseph, the Young Czech chose to compromise. Their reentry into legislative politics marked the end of German Reichsrat majority. The Young Czechs held 85 to 87 of the 425 seats in the Reichsrat by 1900.Leff, Carol Skalnik.: \\"National Conflict in Czechoslovakia.\\", p 24. Princeton University Press., 1988 In 1891, the end of the Old Czech predominance in Czech politics helped to disrupt the conservative ‚Äúiron ring‚Äù parliamentary coalition with whose help Count Taaffe had governed since 1879, and marks the beginning of the modern era of Czech political parties. In February 1918, the party formally merged with a new coalition, the Czech State Right Democratic Party, which later, under the Republic, became the party of Czechoslovak National Democracy headed by former Young Czech leader Karel Kram√°≈ô.

This practice has been present since the sixteenth century and was influenced by contemporary practices, and it is a very longstanding and controversial topic. Skin bleaching is a practice where women and men use various chemical and cosmetics products to attempt to lighten or whiten the color of the skin. These products often contain one or both of two chemicals: hydroquinone and mercury and can sometimes lead to negative physical effects, such as cancer and can cause rash and flaky skin, as well as uneven light and dark patches on the skin. Because of the health risks involved with skin lightening, Ghana has implemented legislation against the use of skin lightening products. Though the products have recently been banned, Ghanaian women can still acquire them through illegal means or use homemade skin lightening chemicals. Light skinned is frequently marketed via billboards and posters that feature light skinned models, playing on the public perception that looking multiracial or having lighter skin makes one more attractive. Some Ghanaians also believe that if a lighter-skinned person is in a position of power, that they bleached to get into that position and is bleaching to maintain it. Historians such as Jemima Pierre theorize that the desire for lighter colored skin stem from apartheid and the British colonization of West Africa. White skin asserted class privilege and distinct racial privilege, prompting many Ghanaians to bleach their skin to achieve a similar color. Over time this also became a major determinant of beauty, especially among Ghanaian women, and by the 1980s skin bleaching had spread throughout all socioeconomic classes of women. Despite being a common practice among Ghanaians, lower-class people are often openly ridiculed for skin bleaching. Blacks who bleach their skin (regardless of socioeconomic status) are often ridiculed for aspiring and ultimately failing to become white.

Larry D. Nichols, born 1939 in the United States, is a puzzle designer. He grew up in Xenia, Ohio, and studied chemistry at DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, before moving to Massachusetts to attend Harvard Graduate School. He is best known for the invention of mechanical puzzles including 'The Nichols Cube Puzzle' (1974), patent US365520.Pattern forming puzzle and method with pieces rotatable in groups US 3655201 A He has lived with his wife Karen in Arlington, Massachusetts since 1959. The Nichols Cube Puzzle (Twizzle) In 1957, 17 years before Dr. Rubik‚Äôs invention popularly known as the ‚ÄúRubik's Cube‚Äù, Dr. Nichols conceived of a twist cube puzzle with six colored faces. It was a 2√ó2√ó2 cube assembled from eight unit cubes with magnets on their inside faces, allowing the cubes to rotate in groups of four around three axes. The object of the puzzle was to mix the colors on the faces of the cube and then restore them. After making many preliminary models, in 1968 a working prototype was constructed, and on April 11, 1972, U.S. patent 3,655,201 was issued covering the Nichols' Cube. The patent focused on the 2√ó2√ó2 puzzle but mentioned the possibility of larger versions. Nichols' patents became the subject of a court hearing, between his employer, and the Ideal Toy Company.The Legal Puzzle of the Rubik‚Äôs CubeNY Times: Cube Is A Problem To CBSFirst Version In 1985 a U.S. District Court ruled that Rubik‚Äôs Cube infringed the Nichols patent, but in 1986 the Court of Appeals ruled that only the smaller 2√ó2√ó2 Rubik‚Äôs Pocket Cube was guilty of infringement, and not the popular 3√ó3√ó3 Rubik's Cube.Age of Puzzles = Analogues of the invention = * Manipulative toy William O Gustafson 1960 Patent US3081089: 'Manipulatable toy' by William O Gustafson 1960 * Rubik's Cube 1974 Patent US4378117: 'Spatial intelligent toy' by Erno Rubik 1974 * Frank Fox got a British patent for a spherical sliding puzzle in 1974 Patent GB1344259: 'Amusement device' by Frank Fox 1974 * Terutoshi Ishige received a Japanese patent for a 3x3x3 in 1976 WIRED: Rubik Applies for Patent on Magic Cube Career Nichols received a degree in chemistry in 1958 from DePauw University, where he was a Rector Scholar, and went on to earn a doctorate at Harvard.

Nevertheless, it has been rarely reported, only from the southern part of the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, Sardinia and Sicily.  Morphology  The body is mainly brown- orange, slightly darker on the head and the most posterior part of the body, including the ultimate pair of appendages. Conversely, the antennae and the walking legs are paler. The body length may surpasses 12 cm, which is the maximum measured from the anterior margin of the head to the posterior tip of the trunk, among the few specimens collected. Even higher measures have been reported in the past. P. zwierleini is fully blind, without trace of eyes. As in all other centipedes, the first appendages of the trunk are a pair of piercing fangs, which are used to grasp and poison prey. Two denticulate plates project forwards between the fangs, which have also a small tubercle on their mesal side. leftthumb268x268pxP. zwierleini, from Trecastagni, Sicily. Poison fangs, ventral view A total of 20 walking legs are present on both sides of the body. In addition to short setae that are sparse on the entire body surface, including the appendages, the ventral side of the basal articles of the legs are covered with remarkably dense and long setae, which is unusual among centipedes. The function of these unusual setae is unknown. The tergites covering the body trunk, one every pair of legs, are alternatively slightly longer and slightly shorter, as common in scolopendromorph centipedes.thumbP. zwierleini, from Trecastagni, Sicily. Posterior part of body, dorsal view 222x222px The most posterior tergites are particularly broader and more sclerotized, and the last one is conspicuously elongate. A longitudinal series of 19 spiracles is present on each side of the body, one spiracle per walking leg, close to the leg attachment, to the exclusion of the first pair of legs. Such arrangement of the spiracles is unique to P. zwierleini in comparison to all other scolopendromorphs. The ultimate pair of appendages resembles the anterior fangs in size, shape and mechanics: they are basally very swollen and bear elongate blade-edged claws. During locomotion, the ultimate appendages are kept aligned longitudinally at the end of the body. However, after disturbance, they are often raised and splayed, apparently assuming a warning posture. The ultimate appendages are possibly employed in defence against predators and it has also been speculated that they could be used to catch and hold prey, but observations are lacking. Juveniles are similar to adults, and there no significant differences between males and females. The few specimens found insofar are quite variable in the elongation of the antennae and the walking legs, but it is unclear whether this is associated with habitat differences or some geographic differentiation.  Distribution and habitat  P. zwierleini was first described upon specimens collected around year 1878 near Taormina, in Sicily. Soon after, the species was reported also from Sardinia and near Sorrento in the Italian peninsula. However, despite the large size and the distinctive morphological characters, P. zwierleini has been found only rarely. Up to 2017, less than 50 records have been documented. Dedicated field campaigns carried on by different zoologists turned out often unsuccessful, while most records have been obtained by occasional findings by speleologists, amateurs and common citizens. thumbP. zwierleini, from Massa Lubrense, Campania. 30 August 2008, photo Gaspare Adinolfi 261x261pxAs far as known, P. zwierleini lives in four separate areas of southern Europe: in the southern Iberian Peninsula, between Malaga and Granada; in Sardinia, mainly in the eastern part; in some Tyrrhenian coastal areas of the southern part of the Italian peninsula, especially the Sorrento peninsula; and in Sicily, mainly in the north-eastern part. Specimens of P. zwierleini have been found both in epigeic habitats (rocky debris, woods, maquis, pastures and also urban settlements and cultivated land) and in hypogeic sites (in natural caves, at least in the Iberian peninsula and in Sardinia, but also inside buildings, especially basements and ground floors). All records have been between a few tens of metres above sea level to 1220 m, in Sardinia.  Evolutionary relationships  Both morphological and molecular analyses suggest that P. zwierleini belongs to the so-called ‚Äúblind clade‚Äù of scolopendromorph centipedes (including Plutoniumidae, Cryptopidae and Scolopocryptopidae) and is strictly related to Theatops. In the past, the evolutionary affinities of Plutonium have been a matter of speculations, within the more general debates on the evolution of the segmental anatomy of the Arthropoda.

He was educated at Batley grammar school and was then apprenticed to Mr. Hall, a general practitioner at Wortley. He finished his medical training in Leeds, Paris, and London‚Äîin Paris he studied under Claude Bernard. He graduated M.B. at London University in 1845, and M.D. in 1851. Radcliffe became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1848, and was elected a Fellow in 1858. He was Gulstonian lecturer in 1860, and Croonian lecturer in 1873. He subsequently became a councillor of the College of Physicians, and in 1875‚Äì6 he acted as its censor. In 1853, Radcliffe was appointed assistant physician to Westminster Hospital, where he succeeded to the office of full physician 25 April 1857, and was elected to the consulting staff on 27 May 1873. He lectured on botany and materia medica, in the medical school attached to the hospital. In 1863 he was appointed physician to the National Hospital for the Paralysed and Epileptic in Queen Square, as successor to Charles Brown- S√©quard, and it was there that he made a reputation for work on the diseases of the nervous system. Radcliffe died very suddenly on 18 June 1889, and was buried in Highgate cemetery. Works Radcliffe was one of the early British investigators of the electrical physiology of muscle and nerve: John Burdon- Sanderson called him a vitalist, for whom electricity took the place of the \\"vital principle\\". He published: * Proteus, or the Law of Nature, London, 1850. * The Philosophy of Vital Motion, 1851. * Epilepsy and other Affections of the Nervous System marked by Tremor, Convulsion, or Spasm, 1854; 2nd edit. 1858; 3rd edit. 1861. * Lectures on Epilepsy, Pain, Paralysis, and certain other disorders of the Nervous System, 1864. * Articles in Reynolds's System of Medicine, 1868 and 1872. * Dynamics of Nerve and Muscle, 1871. * Vital Motion as a Mode of Physical Motion, 1876. * The Connection between Vital and Physical Motion: a Conversation, privately printed, 1881. * Behind the Tides, privately printed. Radcliffe was joint editor with William Harcourt Ranking from 1845 to 1873 of Ranking's Abstract of the Medical Sciences. Family Radcliffe married, in 1851, Mary Reece Urling, daughter of George Frederick Urling, but left no issue.

S. Robinson is an associate professor and the Dorothy J. Wingfield Phillips Chancellor's Faculty Fellow in the Department of Chemistry at the Vanderbilt University, where she is the principal investigator of the RASR Laboratory. Robinson is recognized as an emerging leader in proteomics and the study of Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and aging. She has developed a novel multiplexing strategy for quantitative proteomics called cPILOT. She has received a number of awards, including the 2017 Pittsburgh Conference Achievement Award. Education and early research Born Rena A. Sowell, Ren√£ A. S. Robinson is married and has two children. Robinson completed her B.S. in Chemistry at the University of Louisville in 2000. She received her Ph.D. in Analytical Chemistry in 2007 from Indiana University Bloomington where she worked with David E. Clemmer. While still a Ph.D. student, she pioneered work that combined techniques for ion-mobility spectrometry and time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify proteins in fruit flies and study aging. These proteomics methods were used to identify over 1,600 proteins. Results indicated connections between metabolic and defense-response proteins and aging. Robinson then worked with Allan Butterfield at the University of Kentucky, receiving two postdoctoral fellowships: the Lyman T. Johnson fellowship and the UNCF/Merck Postdoctoral Fellowship. With Butterfield, she used proteomics methods to study Alzheimer's disease in animals and humans. Her research was important in the laboratory's discovery that free radical oxidative stress affects Alzheimer's brains. Scientific career From 2009 to 2017, Robinson was an assistant professor in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, and a faculty member of the Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Center at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer Disease Research Center. At the end of 2017, she joined Vanderbilt University where she now leads the RASR Laboratory as an Associate Professor of Chemistry, in the Department of Chemistry, Department of Neurology and faculty member of the Department of Chemical Biology, and Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer‚Äôs Center. Robinson's research focuses on how changes in the brain and the rest of the body are related in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. Of particular interest, is the molecular basis of racial disparities in age-related diseases whereby certain populations of people have higher incidences and risk of disease. For example, Black and Hispanic populations develop Alzheimer's at a rate two to three times higher than the majority of the US population. While many factors can contribute to health disparities, Robinson uses a variety of high-throughput analytical methodologies and novel proteomics approaches to determine if molecular differences can help explain disparities in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and sepsis. One of the questions she studies is whether changes external to the brain, such as oxidative stress or metabolic alterations, occur before or after changes within the brain. Proteins are involved in major functions throughout the body, including communication between cells. Changes in protein function, or in expression level of a protein, may cascade from one protein to another throughout a system. Protein behavior changes as people age, but scientists do not yet know why: is it a result of incremental damage over time, from oxidative stressors or other causes; or is there some inherent signal that triggers changes with age, and if so, what purpose does it serve? By studying immunosenescence, Robinson hopes to relate early changes in the immune system to changes in molecular systems and the development of Alzheimer's and other age-related diseases. Robinson continues to develop novel equipment and techniques for Ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and mass spectrometry (MS). She develops new proteomics techniques which are used to study the molecular basis of aging throughout the body, particularly the production of Amyloid precursor proteins and Amyloid beta peptides in organs beyond the central nervous system. Robinson has developed a novel multiplexing strategy for quantitative proteomics called \\"combined precursor isotopic labeling and isobaric tagging\\" or cPILOT, that can examine 12 or 16 samples at a time. By replacing specific precursor atoms by their isotope, monitoring reactions, and tracking the passage of an isotope within the body, Robinson identifies proteins that have been modified. Better understanding the changes that take place in Alzheimer's disease, may lead to the development of new treatments. Robinson was elected President Elect of the National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers (NOBCChe) for the 2019-2021 term. She will become President in 2021.  Public science and mentorship  In addition to her dedication to improving human health through scientific research, Robinson also focuses on providing professional and scientific development activities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researches as well as engaging in community outreach activities for K through 12 students. Robinson was the Associate Director of Outreach, Recruitment and Education at the University of Pittsburgh, Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Research Center and has continued to provide mentorship within and outside her academic lab at Vanderbilt. As a Vanderbilt Global Voices Fellow, Robinson continues to build public awareness for her body of work related to racial and ethnic disparities in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease as well as risk factors impacting the disproportionate affect of COVID-19 in communities of color in the USA.

Local residents gathered to see Beachey's flying machine on July 8, 1911 where it took off from the Kenmore Land Co. field which is where East Third Street and Northway Road are today. Despite the actions of the Burn brothers, August Kuntz and Beachey the region was not struck by the aviation boom until local pilots Captain Cleo Francis Pineau and A.W. Hinaman paved the way. Pineau served with the Royal Air Force during World War I. After which he returned to Williamsport where he helped form the airport. Hinaman was an instrumental in local aviation, eventually heading up Hinaman Aircraft Corp., which sponsored the first commercial flight to New York City. Hinaman also started the regions first flight school which trained pilots during World War IIMaurer, Maurer (1983). Air Force Combat Units of World War II.

About two years prior the city had bought 161 acres from local farmers for about $75,000. Where they constructed a hangar, and a x style cross runway for about $30,000. The airport was dedicated on July 20, 1929 and was heralded as one of the great leaders of the aviation movement on the east coast. An estimated crowd of 30,000 people was believed to be in attendance which is the largest gathering in Lycoming county history.Airports Council International Final statistics for 2005 traffic movements The Airport held its first flight earlier that year and was operational ever since. The first ever commercial flight from New York City to Williamsport occurred in 1931. And passenger service has continued ever since. On April 25, 1993, Thomas L. Knauff set an FAI world record flying a glider on an out-and-return course of , releasing from tow over this airport, then flying along the Appalachian Mountains to Corryton, Tennessee, and returning for a landing 10 hours later.

They are notable for their small size, and for being among the oldest known crocodylomorph eggs. Description Suchoolithus is known from a single, well-preserved egg clutch of 13 eggs. The eggs have a blunt, ellipsoid shape, and are quite small (measuring only long by across). All but two of the eggs are arranged horizontally in the clutch. The eggshell is only 163 Œºm thick, and is sculpted with tiny, irregular bumps on its outer surface. Like other crocodylian eggs, its shell is composed of thousands of tiny calcium carbonate crystal units; in S. portucalensis, these eggshell units are trapezoidal, tightly packed, and wider than they are tall. Russo et al. 2017 did not observe any pores openings on the eggshell's surface, though a possible pore canal was observed in one section of the shell. History Fossil crocodylian eggs are generally rare, though they have been discovered worldwide (excepting Antarctia and Australia). In 2008, the Portuguese paleontologist Oct√°vio Mateus discovered a fossilized egg clutch at the Lourinh√£ Formation of Portugal that would later become holotype of Suchoolithus. These eggs were first described in 2014 by Russo, Mateus, Balbino, and Marzola, who at the time tentatively referred them to Krokolithes, but noted their similarities to the Krokolithid Bauruoolithus. In 2016, Jo√£o Russo, working with Oct√°vio Mateus as his supervisor and Balbino as co-supervisor, completed his Master's Thesis at Faculdade de Ci√™ncias e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, in which he named the oogenus and oospecies Suchoolithus portucalensis (meaning \\"crocodile egg stone from Portugal\\"). The next year, Russo, Mateus, Marzola, and Balbino published the description of Suchoolithus in PLOS One. Paleobiology and paleoecology Bernissartia, a crocodylomorph from the Lourinh√£ Formation, and possibly the parent of Suchoolithus Suchoolithus is known exclusively from the upper Tithonian of the Late Jurassic Lourinh√£ Formation of Portugal, making it (alongside Krokolithes dinophilus) the oldest known crocodylomorph egg. This formation, representing the deposits of river deltas and alluvial fans, has similar fauna and flora to the contemporaneous Morrison Formation in the United States and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Several types of crocodylomorphs are known from the late Jurassic of Portugal, but given the small size of the eggs, it is most likely that Suchoolithus were laid by one of the smaller species (perhaps less than long), such as Bernissartia, cf. Alligatorium, Lisboasaurus, Lusitanisuchus, or Theriosuchus.

The songwriter, Michael Timmins, \\"started to think in terms of an album of songs reflecting on the lives of characters I'd written about early in the bands career and bringing those characters 20 years into the future to see where their lives were at now. Some of those songs have little touch points where, if you're a real freak and analyze the music, you can see how they connect to earlier songs -- even character's names and stuff pops into them, and that's intentional. It was fun to sit and go over those older songs and some of the ideas I was thinking about and exploring and believed in and seeing 20 years later where I sit with some of those ideas. It's always fascinating to do that with yourself and with the songs. It's a treat for me, anyway.\\" The style of the songs on the album resemble earlier Cowboy Junkies music more than the other albums in the Nomad series.

It was named for John Burroughs, the naturalist, who visited the mountain several times. The mountain was first called John Burroughs Mountain. Burroughs was born near Roxbury, New York, in April 1837, and died in 1931. He wrote extensively about his travels and was associated with the conservation movement. He became a well known \\"character\\" and is best remembered for his \\"Nature Essay.\\" Dictionary of American Biography, II, 330- 334. Burroughs Mountain is a high ridge formed from an ancient lava flow. Its three summit plateaus get progressively higher. The mountain, located within Mount Rainier National Park, is notable for alpine tundra, with plants typically seen at much higher latitudes. The tundra ground cover hugs the barren rocky plateau and has a short growing season because snow covers the ridge for much of the year in the harsh alpine climate. The unique fragile alpine tundra can be easily destroyed by people walking off the established trail. The mountain is a popular hiking destination with grand close-up views of the Emmons Glacier, Winthrop Glacier, Inter Glacier, Fryingpan Glacier, Little Tahoma Peak, and views in all directions because most of the trail is above tree line. The trail starts at the Sunrise Historic District and loops up to First Burroughs Mountain (elevation 7160 feet) and Second Burroughs Mountain (elevation 7402 feet). Third Burroughs Mountain (7828 feet) is off- trail and about another mile beyond Second Burroughs. The loop trail is about 6.2 miles and part of this loop trail includes a short section of the Wonderland Trail. Access is limited by snow closing the Sunrise Road much of the year, and even more by ice blocking the trail above Frozen Lake. July, August, and September are the months when the Sunrise Road is seasonally open for vehicle traffic. Geology Burroughs Mountain, situated at the northeast foot of Mount Rainier, WA, exposes a large-volume (3.4 km3) andesitic lava flow, up to 350 m thick and extending 11 km in length. Two sampling traverses from flow base to eroded top, over vertical sections of 245 and 300 m, show that the flow consists of a felsic lower unit (100 m thick) overlain sharply by a more mafic upper unit. The mafic upper unit is chemically zoned, becoming slightly more evolved upward; the lower unit is heterogeneous and unzoned. The lower unit is also more phenocryst-rich and locally contains inclusions of quenched basaltic andesite magma that are absent from the upper unit. Widespread, gabbronorite-to-diorite inclusions may be fragments of shallow cumulates, exhumed from the Mount Rainier magmatic system.Origin and emplacement of the andesite of Burroughs Mountain, a zoned, large-volume lava flow at Mount Rainier, Washington, USA Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research By: K.R.

Deer and the American black bear (Ursus americanus) can be found lower on the mountain in Berkeley Park. Climate Burroughs Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.

It is owned and managed by Earley Town Council. Geography and site The nature reserve consists of areas of ancient and secondary woodland, grassland, a large lake, a brook, an old woodland pond and surrounding wetland habitat. The reserve supports a large amount of wildlife including over a 100 species of butterflies and moths, more than 50 species of birds, 50 species of fungi and over 20 species of trees. The site features a lake which is 2.4 hectares in area and up to 2 meters deep. The lake features two islands, which birds use as nesting places. The reserve features woodlands that contain a small pond which is the last remaining remnant of a second lake that used to occupy much of this copse area. On the south side of the lake is more woodland, plus a wildflower meadow and butterfly garden. =Features= On the island within the lake known as Swan Island a statue made out of a tree that had fallen in 2007 was revealed to the public in 2009. History The area of the reserve called Oak Wood dates from at least the 16th century and contains some 18 indicator species associated with old woodlands. The lake area which was once a wet woodland is believed to have been created, by damming the area, sometime between the Middle Ages to the 18th century to create fishponds, provide ice and create a landscape feature. The 1820 maps of enclosures and the tithe map of 1844 both show the woodlands and lake, within Maiden Erlegh Park, as being almost the same size and shape as today. The lake and surrounding site was purchased by Solomon Joel in 1903, where it is believed he had the larger of the two islands in the lake created. In response to the demands of local residents Coopers Estates agreed to sell Maiden Erlegh Lake and the surrounding woodland to Earley Parish Council in return for being allowed to build on another greenfield site in 1965 for a sum of ¬£8,500. The land sold in 1965 consisted of the lake itself, plus Oakwood, Old Pond Copse and a small part of Moor Copse. In 1991 Old Lane Wood was acquired from Wokingham Borough Council for ¬£1. In 1996 the area was then declared a local nature reserve by Earley Town Council.

He is Emeritus professor of the School of Planning and Landscape Architecture of the Universite de Montreal, Emeritus Chair of the Commission on Environmental Planning of the International Union for the conservation of nature (IUCN), Past President of the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects (CSLA), Chair of the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission (from 1979) and a Member of the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts.  Biography  Jacobs was born in Montreal on 3 December 1939. His parents were both natives of New York City: Jacob Joseph Jacobs graduated from New York University as a chemical engineer and Francis Alexander graduated from Barnard College in ancient languages. His interest in nature and the landscape was nurtured during summer family trips to the ocean and others in the northern boreal forest. His commitment to the urban landscape was derived from his experience of the cultural diversity and convivial social energy of Montreal. He is married to Ellen Vineberg Jacobs, distinguished professor emerita of Concordia University in Montreal. Jacobs graduated from Antioch College with a bachelor's degree (1961) in engineering and fine arts. He continued his studies at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where he obtained a Masters of Architecture degree (1964) followed by a Master of Landscape Architecture degree (1968). He then pursued a program of special studies in human ecology at Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia. Following his studies, Jacobs pursued both an academic and professional career. After first practicing architecture, he concentrated on landscape planning and urban design. In 1971 he was promoted to associate professor and in 1979 to full professor in the School of Landscape Architecture, Universite de Montreal. He was the school's first director (1978) and the first associate dean of research of the Faculte de l‚ÄôAmenagement (1977‚Äì1984). He was named Emeritus professor in 2016. Peter Jacobs is Fellow and past president of the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects (CSLA) (1978‚Äì1980), Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA), and served as the Canadian delegate to the International Federation of Landscape Architects (IFLA) (1986‚Äì1995). In 2016, he was named Chair of the Montreal Heritage Council.  Main achievements and contributions  = Pedagogical development of a new field of studies = Jacobs' teaching is based on the structure and meaning of the urban and rural landscape as well as the use of criteria such as belonging, equity, and integrity in the design of landscape form. Due to his expertise, Peter Jacobs has been invited to evaluate numerous academic programs in Canada, Israel, Columbia, France, China and Spain. He has also given intensive courses and design studios in more than 50 universities around the world. His research and community activities have focused on the sustainable and equitable development and conservation of the landscape in association with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission as Chair of the Commission (KEQC) since 1979, and as Chair of the Public Advisory Council for the Canadian State of the Environment Report (1991). = Early stages of environmental evaluation = Jacobs was one of the early participants in a variety of environmental evaluation formats related to urban development and the North, both as a chair and a member of numerous public commissions. He chaired the public consultation process on the future of Lancaster Sound in the Canadian arctic (1980) and has Chaired the Kativik Environmental Quality Commission in Nunavik (since 1981). He also co-Chaired the public hearings related to the environmental impacts of the Great Whale Hydoelectric Project flowing into James Bay, Quebec (1992‚Äì1994). In the urban context, he has participated as a commissioner for the Bureau de consultation de Montreal and the Office de consultation Publique de Montreal on files related to the development of urban neighborhoods, urban infrastructure, and the planning and design of large metropolitan parks and nature reserves. In 1990, as a member of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Research Council (CEARC), he co- edited and was one of the chief architects of a research report on Sustainable Development and Environmental Assessment : Perspectives on Planning for a Common Future. Internationally, he has served as a consultant for programs sponsored by UNESCO, MAB, UNU, and IUCN. = Relationship of landscape and culture = One of the principal research fields developed by Jacobs is linked to the impact of culture and cultural values to the perception and management of landscapes. Numerous international missions in Africa, Latin America, Australia, and Europe as well as the arctic landscapes of Northern Quebec have provided a rich array of conditions and experiences that contribute to a diversity of cultural perspectives as to how the landscape is perceived and managed. His prolonged research visits to Dumbarton Oaks as chair of the Senior Fellows of the Landscape and Garden Studies program and subsequently as Beatrix Farrand Distinguished Fellow provided further material with which to evaluate the diverse cultural visions of the landscape. = Community service = Jacobs' commitment to the community is marked by his desire to integrate professional practice with academic research in the service of community growth and development. As chair of the Environmental Planning Commission from 1978‚Äì1990, he helped formulate nature conservation programs and action plans for numerous countries. His environmental activities have focused on nature conservancy, the preservation of urban open space, and the development of policy, programs, and plans in support of equitable and sustainable development. He has served as vice-president of the Solomon Schecter Academy (1973‚Äì1976), advisor to the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, member of the intercultural advisory committee of the City of Montreal, and president of the Jewish Public Library of Montreal(1996‚Äì2000) He has also served as Chair of the community planning and allocations committee and as a Director of the Federation of Jewish Community Agencies, the United Israel Agencies of Canada and the Canadian Jewish National Fund.

It is a political party registered in terms of ZEC requirements in Zimbabwe. Its ability to contest the next election in Zimbabwe in 2018 is unknown. In 2016 it petitioned the Zimbabwean Embassy in Pretoria over the spending of US$800,000 on Robert Mugabe's birthday when many Zimbabweans were starving. The Liberal Democrats have raised various issues about Zimbabwe including their claim that Mr Mugabe, the President of Zimbabwe and the ruling party ZANU PF in Zimbabwe was being abused and his rights as an elderly person being violated by those close to him who were using him for their personal gains. The Liberal Democrats of Zimbabwe appear to be following hard on the issue of individual rights as enshrined or shown in the website and evidenced by this claim on Mr Mugabe who is seen by many as the one violating their rights; yet they ironically contend his rights are being violated instead. In 2017 the Liberal Democrats of Zimbabwe raised a number of issues including the political state of affairs in Zimbabwe through its Chairperson. The open letter appeared to be lamenting the inability to act by the Zimbabwean people and the lack of coherence in political activities. It made mention of the failures of many political parties including the major opposition parties like the MDCT which has always been seen as the contender to political office. The Liberal Democrats weighed in on the Zimbabwean appointment of the Chief Justice again coming in with views about how Mr Mugabe had been forced to appoint the Chief Justice who was not likely to have been his first choice due to the ZANU PF factional wars. Mr Mugabe at the end of March 2017 appointed Justice Luke Malaba as the Chief Justice replacing Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku who had been at the helm of the country of Zimbabwe's legal system for 17 years and was retiring as he had reached his retirement age, the age of 70 as per the Constitution of Zimbabwe. Justice Luke Malaba, who at his appointment was 66, would only serve for 4 years and yet many Zimbabweans had pinned their hopes on the man to change the judiciary having managed some award-winning judgments such as on child marriages. He had outdone two other favoured contenders for ZANU PF in the form of Justice Rita Makarau who is the country's ZEC Chairperson and Judge Paddington Garwe. The Liberal Democrats partnered with other political parties in South Africa in April 2016 while the country was due to commemorate its 36th independence demanding the diaspora vote. The Liberal Democrats is part of a network of political parties and Civic Society Organisations in South Africa that formed the Zimbabwe Diaspora Vote Coalition to lobby for the Zimbabweans in the diaspora to be allowed to vote in Zimbabwe a country that only allows only government employees to vote from outside Zimbabwe. In 2017 during Zimbabwe's independence day celebration the Liberal Democrats wrote an article in which it spoke about what they think independence means in light of the political situation in Zimbabwe. In this document they sought to explain the difference between independence and freedom. Prior to this document the Liberal Democrats published another opinion piece on which it called on ZImbabweans to wake up to their civic duties and responsibilities. In that document it widely spoke about the fallen heroes of Zimbabwean politics from pre-independence to current individuals that are fighting the government of Mr Mugabe. The article highlighted what it viewed as failures by political parties such as MDC-T, which was tipped to win Zimbabwean elections after it won the elections in 2008 but was cheated out of government by ZANU-PF. In March 2018 the Liberal Democrats approached the Zimbabwean Constitutional Court claiming that the actions on the army in November 2017 were unconstitutional. They further claimed in their court papers that the change in power or government was as a result of that coup and therefore prayed the Zimbabwean Apex Court to declare such actions unconstitutional, the resultant government unconstitutional and therefore not worthy to oversee the forthcoming elections in 2018 because it was tainted with illegality and unconstitutionalism. In 2018 the Liberal Democrats did not participate in the national elections citing that the plsying ground was skewed and the elections were a mere facade to endorse the ZANU candidates. This was seen in August 2018 as soldiers killed six people in Harare before election results were announced. Thank country further plunged into worse chaos and food riots in January 2019 and the MDC Alliance list its Constitutional Court bid to have election results overturned. The MDC Alliance also in 2019 and 2020 findinf itself faced with more adverse court decisions and arbitrary ones. All this points to a judiciary that is not independent and works to pkease the appointing authority but not serving as a balancing Act in the trais politica.

Biography  She was born to a middle-class family and received her first art training from the landscape painter, Friedrich Wilhelm Schwinge (1852‚Äì1913). Later, she studied in Hannover, but did not become seriously interested in an artistic career until she was thirty. In 1896, she went to Munich, where she enrolled in the private painting school operated by Ludwig Schmid-Reutte. After completing her studies there, she moved to the artists' colony at Dachau and worked with Adolf H√∂lzel. While there, she became friends with Emil Nolde and travelled to Paris with him, by way of Amsterdam, where she took classes at the short-lived Acad√©mie Carmen; making friends with Alphonse Mucha, Paula Becker and Clara Westhoff. After 1900, she spent time at the artists' colonies in Concarneau and Worpswede; staying with Becker, who had married the painter, Otto Modersohn.

It is the franchise's third television series, after the Western animated Lilo & Stitch: The Series and the Japanese Stitch! anime series. The thirteen-episode series features a Chinese girl named Wang Ai Ling in place of the original 2002‚Äì06 Western continuity's Lilo Pelekai and the anime's Yuna Kamihara, and is set in Huangshan, Anhui. The series first aired in China with a Mandarin Chinese dub from March 27 to April 6, 2017. The original English- language version first aired from February 5 to 27, 2018, in Southeast Asia on that region's Disney Channel. Twelve episodes of the series later received a free digital streaming release in the United States via DisneyNow on December 1, 2018, although it was later removed from the service in June 2019. Plot Stitch & Ai follows the events of Lilo & Stitch and its subsequent film and television sequels up to and including Leroy & Stitch. The series shows Stitch kidnapped by the Jaboodies, a faction of alien criminals who want to use him to have their own destructive genetic experiment. However, thanks to a rival faction called the Woolagongs trying to kidnap Stitch themselves by stealing him from the Jaboodies, Stitch escapes back to Earth, ending up on China's Huangshan mountains. There he befriends Ai, a spirited local girl who is at risk of being separated from her older sister Jiejie. Stitch becomes Ai's \\"dog\\", and the two help one another dealing with the other's problems; Ai helps Stitch deal with the space criminals, while he helps her stay in the mountains with her family. Jumba and Pleakley later show up initially trying to bring Stitch back to the United Galactic Federation, but Ai and Jiejie convince the two aliens to let Stitch stay with them. Although Jumba and Pleakley also stay to keep a watch on Stitch and to help out him and his new family, Jumba gets concerned that a previously-unrevealed metamorphosis function that he secretly programmed in Stitch‚Äîa function that, among other possible transformations, causes the experiment to grow into a giant beast when his destructive programming is triggered in a large city‚Äîcould be unleashed if the space criminals figure out how to subconsciously manipulate Stitch into triggering it. =Continuity= The series has various flashbacks to key scenes in the franchise which appear in episodes 1, 2, and 13. The flashbacks consist of closely re-animated sequences, copying the originals to the best of their ability. Flashback scenes include: * \\"Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride\\" from Lilo & Stitch * \\"Jumba's Trial\\" from Lilo & Stitch * \\"Stitch's Escape\\" from Lilo & Stitch * \\"The Birth of Stitch\\" from Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch * \\"626 Simulation\\" from The Origin of Stitch * \\"Jumba & Stitch\\" from The Origin of Stitch In co-ordinance with this, there are occasional cameos from previous characters of the Lilo & Stitch franchise, including Captain Gantu, the Grand Councilwoman, Cobra Bubbles, and the Ice Cream Man. Characters * Stitch () ‚Äì An alien genetic experiment also known as Experiment 626. He was kidnapped by space criminals who want to use him so they can have their own evil genetic experiment, but he manages to escape back to Earth, ending up in China.

Her aunt wants to move her to the city, but she wants to stay in the mountains. Ai befriends Stitch, taking him in as her \\"dog\\", and helps him ward off the space criminals that want him. She serves as this series's counterpart to Lilo Pelekai. She is voiced in English by Erica Mendez, who tweeted that she is a fan of Stitch and getting to voice his companion in a series was \\"a dream come true\\" for her. In Mandarin, the character is voiced by Jiang Sunwei. * Wang Jiejie () ‚Äì A young Chinese woman who tries to take care of her younger sister Ai after their parents' death.

Episodes Production Stitch & Ai is produced by Anhui Xinhua Media and Panimation Hwakai Media in association with Disney with additional work by Showfun Animation, Shanghai Fire & Ice Media, and Shanghai Aoju Media. The series began broadcast on CCTV-14 on March 27, 2017. Unlike Stitch!, this series was produced in co-operation with American Disney animators to maintain a sense of visual continuity to the original American- produced films and TV series. The series was produced as part of an effort by Disney to enter the Chinese animation market. It was originally produced in English then dubbed into Mandarin Chinese. Tony Craig, an executive producer of Lilo & Stitch: The Series who directed two episodes of the show (\\"Spike\\" and \\"Shoe\\"), and directed and produced its respective pilot and finale films Stitch! The Movie and Leroy & Stitch, served as director for Stitch & Ai. Victor Cook, who was a director for both seasons of Lilo & Stitch: The Series, was initially signed onto the Chinese series and even visited China to assist making the eighth episode. At first, Cook contacted Craig to storyboard the first episode, but when Cook had to drop out due to other commitments, he had Craig take over directing. Craig joined during pre-production, and had to delay joining in full due to a prior employment issue, although Panimation waited for him. Craig oversaw the storyboards, animatics, animation, most of the designs, and all the editing sessions, but he was not involved with the dialogue recordings, which happened in Los Angeles while Craig lives in North Carolina. The show made its English premiere on Disney Channel Asia on February 5, 2018. The series (except for the ninth episode \\"The Phoenix\\") later became available in the United States for free streaming on DisneyNow on December 1, 2018. It was later removed from the service in June 2019.

She earned her B. A. in chemistry from Brandeis University in 1962 and her M. A. in biochemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1964. She has been co-author on over 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals and an invited speaker at scientific meetings including Woods Hole and Cold Spring Harbor courses as well as at professional mycology societies.  Early life and education  Born Beatrice Eve Buten in Merion, Pennsylvania to parents known for their collection of Wedgwood porcelain, Magee grew up in a home which served as the Buten Museum, displaying what was then the largest collection of Wedgwood porcelain in the US. After graduating from Lower Merion High School, she attended Brandeis University majoring in chemistry, where she undertook research into crustacyanin in the laboratory of William Jenks. Her work on this protein, responsible for the red formation of lobsters when cooked, resulted in an early scientific publication. She graduated in 1962. She earned her Master of Science degree in Biochemistry at the University of California Berkeley in 1964. After she married fellow scientist Paul T. Magee, they moved to Paris for 2 years where she attended lectures at the Coll√®ge de France and Le Cordon Bleu. Returning to the U.S., Magee spent the next 6 years working in the laboratory of Edward Adelberg and also gave birth to 2 sons. Magee then formed what has been a more than 35-year scientific collaboration with her husband at Michigan State University and then the University of Minnesota in the College of Biological Sciences. Magee has been a guest lecturer at the Woods Hole Molecular Mycology Course and Cold Spring Harbor courses. Magee and her husband have worked on the human fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and particularly their discovery of sexual mating in this fungus that had been thought to not have a mating cycle. They also made significant contributions to elucidate the genomic sequence and single nucleotide polymorphism mapping for this fungus.  Personal life  While Magee retired as a Senior Scientist from the University of Minnesota in 2007, she remains active singing and rowing. She sings in the second oldest feminist chorus in the U.S., the Calliope Women's Chorus where she served as president for 4 years.

Schneiderman, 581 U.S. _ (2017), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that price controls, when used to prohibit the communication of prices of goods with regards to a surcharge, was a regulation of speech and required an analysis of the First Amendment's protections for freedom of speech. In a five-Justice majority, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, joined by Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Kennedy, Thomas, Ginsburg, and Kagan, wrote that, \\"In regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, ¬ß518 regulates speech.\\", slip op. at 10.  Background  In contracting with credit card companies, retailers are typically assessed a fee whenever a credit card is used.Expressions Hair Design, 581 U.S. _ (2017), slip op. at 1. In order to compensate for these losses in revenue, merchants are given two options: either charge the customer a surcharge based on their use of credit cards, or provide a discount to customers paying with cash. In regards to the former option‚Äîcharging the customer a surcharge‚Äîthe New York Legislature enacted a law, ¬ß518, which banned this practice, in that, \\"[n]o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\\"\\"Credit card surcharge prohibited\\", 2010 New York Code, General Business, Article 29-A¬ß518 Additionally, the New York Legislature was not the only legislative body which had banned surcharges before.

SHRI RATNESHWAR MAHADEV MANDIR Architecture The temple is elegantly constructed in the classical style with a nagara shikhara and phamsana mandapa.Temples Styles in North India (Nagara Style) The site of the temple is very unusual. Unlike all other temples in Varanasi on the coast of Ganga, the temple is built at a very low level. In fact, the water level can reach the shikhara part of the temple.Kashi Vishwanath JyotirLinga Temple Darshan in Varanasi - Part 1, at 8:28 It is constructed at a very low spot; the builder must have known that its garbhagriha would be underwater for much of the year. In spite of much of the temple being underwater during most of the year, it is well preserved, except for the lean that can be noted in 20th century photos. Legend According to a popular legend, it was built by an unnamed servant of Raja Man Singh for his mother Ratna Bai about 500 years ago. After having built the temple, he proudly boasted that he paid his debt to his mother (Matru-rin). However, since the debt to one's mother can never be repaid, the temple started leaning because of a curse by the mother. That is the reason for the alternative name of the temple: Matru-run (Mother's debt). According to another story, it was built by a female servant of Ahilya Bai of Indore, named Ratna Bai. Ahilya Bai cursed it to lean because her servant had named it after herself. History Some sources claim that was built by Queen Baija Bai of Gwalior in the 19th century. The Leaning Temple of Varanasi, 10 October 2020 According to the revenue records, it was constructed during 1825-1830. However, according to Dr. Ratnesh Varma of District Cultural Committee, it was constructed by the Amethi royal family in 1857. ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡§ï‡•á ‡§∂‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§™ ‡§∏‡•á ‡§ü‡•á‡§¢‡§º‡§æ ‡§π‡•Å‡§Ü ‡§•‡§æ ‡§Ø‡§π ‡§Æ‡§Ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§∞, ‡§≠‡§∞‡§æ ‡§∞‡§π‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§ï‡•Ä‡§ö‡§°‡§º, ‡§™‡§¢‡§º‡•á‡§Ç 5 MYTHS, dainikbhaskar.com  14 March 2016 James Prinsep, who was an assay master at the Banaras Mint during 1820-1830,James Prinsep, ENGLISH ANTIQUARIAN, Encyclopaedia Britannica created a series of drawings, one of which includes the Ratneshwar Mahadev temple. He commented that when the temple entrance was underwater, the priest used to dive in the water to conduct worship. Photographs from 1860s do not show the building leaning. Modern photographs show a lean of about 9 degrees (the Leaning Tower of Pisa leans about 4 degrees). The building is likely leaning because it is sinking into silt or due to a faulty foundation. A lightning strike in 2015 caused slight damage to some of the elements of the shikhara.

During World War II, she was one of only two women camera operators allowed on the front lines. Her work was recognized by the Stalin Prize twice, in 1949 and 1951. Early life Ottilia Boleslavovna Reizman, known as \\"Otya\\" was born on 24 September 1914 in Minsk, in the Russian Empire, now Belarus. In 1927, Reizman began working for Belarusfilm. She attended VGIK's camera school at a time when very few women were allowed to enter the field. As it was the only school which trained camera operators, competition for entrance was difficult and there were only a handful of women besides Reizman, including Antonina Egina, Galina Monglovskaya, and , who had been admitted. Career Graduating from VGIK in 1935, Reizman began working at the Moscow Newsreel Studio. She also worked at the Soyuzkinochronika, both were precursors to the current Central Studio for Documentary Film (CSDF), as an assistant camera operator. Reizman took part in the filming of the Great Women's Automobile Race of 1936 and filming of the miners in Kuzbass. The CSDF employed ninety-eight cameramen and only two women, Reizman and Masha Sukhova (ru). In 1938, she was arrested and charged with counter-revolutionary activities (ru) under Article 58 of the Penal Code, but after examination of the evidence, the charges were dismissed. When World War II began, both Reizman and Sukhova asked to be sent to film the action, but were relegated to film behind the German lines accompanying the partisan units under the command of \\"Batya\\", a pseudonym for Grigory Linkov (ru). During a German offensive against the partisans Sukhova was killed, when the camera operators were surrounded and had to break through the lines to run for cover. Upon her return to Moscow, Reizman was decorated with two military honors, Medal \\"Partisan of the Patriotic War\\" and Order of the Patriotic War, both in the second degree. After Belarus was liberated, she was sent to Hungary to film military action there. Some of Reizman's 1944 footage from Budapest was used in the Nuremberg Trials. She worked with the group filming the 2nd Ukrainian Front, the Far Eastern Front and the arrival of the Russians in Czechoslovakia after the German capitulation. In 1947, Reizman was part of the crew which filmed a full-length documentary, Moscow is the Capital of the USSR (), which gave the history of the city during the Russian Revolution, the Great Patriotic War and reconstruction in the post-war period. The following year, she participated in the creation of another full-length film, Guardian of the World (). She received the Stalin Prize in the second degree for these two works. In 1949, Reizman filmed Glory of Labor (), receiving a second Stalin Prize; this one in the third degree. Between 1965 and 1973, Reizman was the director of the CDFS newsreel series Pioneering (). The most noted films of this series were the tenth and eleventh films which featured the Orlyonok's All-Union Children's Arts Festival of 1967. After his breakup with Klavdiya Shulzhenko, and Reizman married, but he returned to Shulzhenko in 1976. Death and legacy Reizman died on 22 April 1986 in Moscow, USSR. In 2014, ARTE France and Melisande Films produced the film Shoah, the Forgotten History () under the direction of Veronique Lagoarde-Segot, using images created by Roman Karmen, Reizman and on the front lines of World War II.

This library, aptly named the Towns-Union Regional Library, was founded in 1946 by both the counties, as well as Young Harris College who agreed to sponsor and provide space for the library in its infancy. The library thus was originally set up in the Rich Building on Young Harris College's campus. By 1957, Fannin County was added to the regional library changing its name to the lengthy Fannin-Towns-Union Regional Library. In the following year, 1958, this name was shortened to the current Mountain Regional Library System. The Fannin branch built their new facility in the library system in 1973 in Blue Ridge, Georgia.

He served as the first Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to Bangladesh from 1976 to 1979, Ambassador to Iran from 1980 to 1982 in the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and Ambassador of Greece from 1983 to 1985. Chinese diplomat Jiao Ruoyu was Ambassador to Iran at the time of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 which overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and established the Islamic Republic of Iran. In August 1979, months after the revolution, Ambassador Jiao returned to China after the Chinese government refused to apologize to Iran for its relations with Pahlavi. China declined to send a new Ambassador to Iran for the remainder of 1979, marking a period of strained relations between the two countries. In April 1980, China appointed Zhuang Yan as its new Ambassador to Iran. Diplomatic experts viewed Zhuang's appointment as a small gesture by the Chinese to improve relations with Iran. In May 1980, Zhuang Yan arranged the first high-level meetings between officials from the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Iran while both delegations were attending the funeral of Josip Broz Tito in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Zhuang went on to serve as Ambassador to Greece from May 1983 to May 1985, his last diplomatic posting as an ambassador. Zhuang Yan died on March 5, 2017, at the age of 99.

Aguacate is also a station on the main line of the Cuban National Railway. History  Royal palms near Aguacate, 1913, at a time when sugar plantations were an important part of the local economyThe town was founded in 1796 by some neighbors who settled in el corral de los Siete Pr√≠ncipes. This community was divided in 1803. That same year the first church was constructed, being auxiliary of Jibacoa. Later an oratorio consecrated to Our Lady of the Carmen was constructed, replacing the first church. The community was severely damaged in the 1846 Havana hurricane. The municipal council dates from 1879. In 1919 Aguacate had a population of 2557 people, increasing to 2895 in 1931 and reaching 3324 in 1943. In 2002 it surpassed 5,000 inhabitants.

Excavations carried out on an ongoing basis since then, have uncovered more than 160 skeletons and more than 70 square barrows thought to date to the Middle Iron Age that are attributed to the Arras culture, an ancient British culture of East Yorkshire. A variety of grave goods have been found along with the human remains, including weapons, beads, pots, and a rare chariot burial. Description The burial ground consists of several dozen barrows located off Burnby Lane on the southeastern edge of Pocklington. They were discovered during the construction of a new housing development by David Wilson Homes. The area is known for previous Iron Age discoveries, so as a condition of planning permission, the developer was required to fund archaeological fieldwork. An initial geophysical survey of the site was carried out by the Malton-based MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd in 2014, which identified at least ten square burial mounds, each of which was situated within a small enclosure. A double-ditched trackway also was identified by an aerial survey; it is associated with eight probable square barrows and a square enclosure located north of the site. Excavations have continued since then, unearthing more than 160 skeletons and more than 74 square barrows. Finds A number of notable discoveries have been made at the site, including weapons, brooches, pots, and hundreds of amber and glass beads buried alongside human remains. In one barrow the remains of a warrior were found. He had been placed on top of his shield ‚Äì the first example of a shield burial to have been found in Britain. In 2016, the well-preserved remains of another warrior aged between 17 and 23 years old were discovered. A broken sword had been placed by his side, which had probably been broken as part of a funeral ritual. The skeleton also was interred with five spears that had been used ritually to pierce the warrior's body. Four had been placed along his spine and another in his groin, probably as part of a ritual to release his spirit. Another skeleton was found with severe injuries inflicted by at least two weapons, buried face-down, and at an unusual depth. The uncommon nature of this burial may have been intended to prevent an unquiet spirit from rising to haunt the living. In 2017, the ongoing excavations uncovered a rare chariot burial comprising an Iron Age chariot and two horses dated to about BC 320 to 174. Although chariot burials have been found elsewhere in the UK, the one at Pocklington is the first to have been found with horses also interred. The remains of the presumed driver, most likely a high-status individual, also were found, along with iron fragments from the chariot's body. The wooden elements of the chariot had rotted away, but had mostly been preserved as stains in the ground. One wheel had been destroyed, probably by ploughing. A bronze shield in the grave was exceptionally well preserved. The shield's boss bears a resemblance to the Wandsworth shield boss (circa BC 350 to 150), owned by the British Museum. One design element on the Pocklington shield, a scalloped border, \\"is not comparable to any other Iron Age finds across Europe, adding to its valuable uniqueness\\", said Paula Ware, managing director at MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd. \\"The discoveries are set to widen our understanding of the Arras (Middle Iron Age) culture and the dating of artefacts to secure contexts is exceptional,\\" Ware added. Dating and analysis The burial grounds in Pocklington are believed to date to some time between the eighth to the third or fourth centuries BC. The finds have been ascribed to the Arras culture, an archaeological culture of the Middle Iron Age that is known mainly from East Yorkshire. Previous Arras culture burial sites have been typified by burials in round and square enclosures, as well as chariot burials. The area is known to have been inhabited by a Celtic tribe called the Parisi, so it is possible that the Pockington burials represent either the Parisi or their ancestors.

She is currently a sculptor who has exhibited in Mexico, the U.S. and Europe. She is also known for working to establish physiognomy as a field in Mexico. Early life Pombar was born in Detroit, Michigan, the daughter of Cuban parents who immigrated to the United States, Thomas A Pombar and Olga Cabrera Guimera. She has Spanish grandparents on her father's side. She considers herself to be Cuban, Spanish and American by heritage, with her Cuban heritage evident still by making Cuban coffee the way her father taught her. She graduated Pershing High School in Detroit and worked as a receptionist for the North Detroit General Hospital along with part-time modeling and hostess jobs during her beauty pageant years. In an interview in 1966, she stated that she wanted to study psychology, but would settle for marriage. In 1971, Pombar moved to Mexico and has lived in the country ever since. This long residency, as well as her Mexican citizenship, gives her Mexican identity as well. Career as beauty queen Her interest in beauty pageants began young. She studied modeling at the Patricia Stevens Career College and Finishing School, and started doing modeling jobs by age 14. Pombar began entering beauty pageants at age 15, entering any and all contests, becoming professional. The rigor of this life left little time for socializing or dating. Pombar's crowns include Miss Metropolitan Beach (1964), Miss Suburban Architectural Bowling League (1965), Miss Autorama 1966, Miss Detroit AMVET (1966), and a finalist for Miss Michigan Universe (1966). Her aim was Miss Universe. Her wins led to work in modeling and commercials. Her participation in this field also allowed her to meet and work with various local celebrities such as Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels, as well as international figures. At a Detroit radio station, she met Mick Jagger as both were scheduled to be interviewed. He asked her out, but her father would not permit it, concerned about drugs. She introduced the Beatles at their first performance at Detroit in 1964 at the Olympic Arena. In a later interview she stated, \\"It was strange at that time because the Motown sound was big then and the Beatles seemed just like any other group. At that time I didn‚Äôt realize who I was really with. During the performance girls started throwing things, then all of a sudden it got really wild, everything sort of went out of control and we were all literally carried off stage ‚Äì and that was it. Everything was a mess. It wasn‚Äôt until later, looking back, that I completely understood the phenomena.\\" Career as a sculptor Pombar working on a bust of one of the Beatles at her workshop in Mexico City In several interviews she stated that she had an interest in beauty and its composition from a young age and had always worked with her hands. However, it was not until later in life that she began an artistic career. She was working as a translator for PEMEX in Mexico when she decided to study art. Initially, she was interested in carving wood, and took a class. The instructor asked the class to copy a piece, and Pombar was the only one who made an exact copy. Despite this, she still did not realize she had talent. She also took some classes for beginners with the Escuela de Artesan√≠as Mexicanas and Academy of San Carlos. At a sculpture workshop, she learned that there were names for the techniques that she was developing on her own. Ultimately, she asked Mexican artist Gabriel Ponzanelli to teach her, but he refused, stating that she had her own style and should work on developing that. He has supported her work in other ways, such as exhibitions. She belongs to no group, gallery or movement, but feels accomplished for what she has created. Pombar has exhibited her work in collective and individual shows since 1977. Main shows include: Centro Iberoamericano de Convenciones (1977) Escuela de Artesanias Mexicanas (1978) American Embassy in Mexico (1980) Centro Americano Ejecutivo de Idiomas y Murguia Garcia SA La Piramide Cultural Center (1984) Forma, Color y Movimiento in El Pedregal restaurant in Tamaulipas (1986). Dos pinceles, dos cinceles at the Galeria Art Centrum in Polanco (1991) Sentimientos in Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Mexico City (1995), Temperamento y Bronce in Mexico City (1997) and Las Jaulas in Polanco, Mexico City. She placed first at the Ventrina degli Artisti Latinoamericani Biennale in 2001 in Florence, Italy. where she identified as a Mexican artist. Pombar created a monumental work for the ASPCA of Missouri displayed in Memorial Park, and her work is promoted in Spain by the Grif√© y Escoda Gallery in Barcelona. Her apartment in Mexico City also serves as a gallery and workshop. Pombar has stated in interviews that as a beauty queen the attention she received was superficial, focused only on her exterior. However, work in sculpture brings respect for her mind and allows people to appreciate her for who she is. Working at her home studio (which also serves as a gallery), she creates works exclusively in bronze, preferring its hardness and durability. She makes her models first with clay, with the final product cast with the lost wax method. For her, art is a means of communication, with most of her pieces figures of men and women conveying attitudes and emotions through their body language and facial expressions. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt write poems, I model them.‚Äù she states. She does not do self-portraits, and her figures look neither at each other (even if intertwined) or at the observer. Instead, they seem introspective. Her non-artistic work in physical fitness, and psychology and physiognomy are evident as well, as she focuses on muscle structure, stating that in the face muscles are actors which control expression. Texture is also important to her work, often a study in contrasts. Pombar's work allows her to express the sadness she has experienced in her life as well as the strength to continue. One episode in her life which is prominent in a number of her work is her battle with breast cancer, which led to reconstructive surgery on one side. The art for her has been therapeutic, as well as a basis for raising awareness of breast cancer through exhibitions and giving talks on health to various groups. Pieces related to her cancer experience include Intruso (Intrusion), Mi Matador (My Matador), Clemencia (Clemency), Templo (Temple), Inerte (Inert), La mutilaci√≥n (Mutilation), Renacimiento (Rebirth), Despu√©s de Ti (After You) and Sue√±os (Dreams). Pombar considers her works as her children, as they are born on her emotions and experiences. At the 1986 exhibition Forma Color y Movimentos she refused to sell her work saying that ‚Äúone becomes possessive with their works, they are like children and have to find their own way without their parents.‚Äù Life in Mexico Pombar moved to Mexico in 1971, not long before her 30th birthday. Before and in addition to sculpture, she has been involved in a number of projects and activities, stating as a youth that she gets bored easily, and today still works constantly. She worked as a translator for various Mexican government agencies and ran the Centro Din√°mico de Idiomas language school in Mexico City from 1975 to 1985. In the latter 1980s, she started a gym in her home in Tamaulipas as a hobby. Soon someone asked her to train them and she eventually became certified in both the US and Tamaulipas as a fitness instructor. She founded the Women to Women, Professioal Health and Fitness Center in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas in 1985 which she ran until 1991. Here she worked almost exclusively with women, noting that many felt \\"dead\\" by the age of forty. In 1991, she moved the business to the Polanco neighborhood in Mexico City after her divorce, making it a mixed sex gym, working with many men with sedentary computer/desk jobs. At its peak, the business had 245 clients but her breast cancer battle in this decade caused her to lose the business. Her interest in physical structure/fitness and psychology has led her to regularly give talks on health in Mexico City. It has also led to studies in justice and criminality studies. Combing these with psychology and art, she has made herself an expert in physiognomy, focusing on the face in particular. This is not a well-developed field in Mexico, so she was worked training public officials and presented af various psychology conferences in Mexico. She has been consulted to analyze faces of notable suspects, political candidates and other famous people.

He was also an orchid enthusiast. Born the second son of William Smee, accountant-general to the Bank of England, Alfred Smee entered in November 1829 St Paul's School, London and in October 1834 became a medical student at King's College, London. During most of his student life, he lived at his father's official residence within the Bank of England and there did research on chemistry and electro-metallurgy which made him famous a few years later. After King's College, he entered St Bartholomew's Hospital, became a surgical assistant to Sir William Lawrence, 1st Baronet, and received in April 1840 his diploma as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons. Smee became a consulting surgeon at the London Institution and specialised in diseases of the eye. During this time as a consulting surgeon he also continued his chemical and electro-metallurgical research and developed the Smee's battery (zinc plate and silver plate, coated with platinum black, in sulphuric acid), for which he was awarded the gold Isis medal from the Society of Arts. In 1840 he published a valuable treatise on electro-metallury dealing with the principles of reduction of metals in different states. His 1849 treatise Elements of Electro-Biology was a pioneering effort in electrical physiology and in 1850 a popular version was published with the title Instinct and Reason. At the London Institution he helped to establish in 1854 a long-lived system of educational lectures. Smee is credited with the first sighting (29 June 1861) of the Great Comet of 1861 in the northern hemisphere (previously discovered on 13 May 1861 in the southern hemisphere by John Tebbutt). In the later part of his life Smee maintained an experimental garden at Wallington Bridge, in the hamlet of Wallington, in the parish of Beddington, in the county of Surrey; the garden covered 7.925 acres of land and water. He married Elizabeth Hutchison on 2 June 1840 in London. They had a son and two daughters. Elizabeth Mary Smee (1843-1919) married William Odling and published a memoir of her father in 1878. Alfred Hutchison Smee (1841‚Äì1901) became a physician who was elected a Fellow of the Chemical Society and a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society.

Of these six songs, \\"Don Juan's Serenade\\" was the most successful, becoming one of the best-known works among the approximately 100 romances that Tchaikovsky composed during his lifetime.Schweitzer, Vivian. \\"Russian Romances, Lovelorn Variety\\", The New York Times (April 5, 2008). At this point in his life, the composer was rebounding from a personal crisis, having married and quickly separated the year before. Tchaikovsky characterized the creation of this opus as \\"something between relaxation and work\\".To my best friend: correspondence between Tchaikovsky and Nadezhda von Meck, 1876-1878, pp. 229-233 (Oxford U. Press, 1993). List of six songs Opus 38 consists of the following six songs, with tempo indicated in Italian: #Don Juan's Serenade (–°–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∞–¥–∞ –î–æ–Ω-–ñ—É–∞–Ω–∞), Allegro non tanto (B minor, 164 bars) #It was in the Early Spring (–¢–æ –±—ã–ª–æ —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–µ—é –≤–µ—Å–Ω–æ–π), Allegro moderato (E‚ô≠ major, 101 bars) #Amid the Din of the Ball (–°—Ä–µ–¥—å —à—É–º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –±–∞–ª–∞), Moderato (B minor, 99 bars) #O, If Only You Could (–û, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –± —Ç—ã –º–æ–≥–ª–∞), Allegro agitato (D major, 38 bars) #The Love of a Dead Man (–õ—é–±–æ–≤—å –º–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–µ—Ü–∞), Andante non tanto (F major, 129 bars) #Pimpinella: Florentine Song (–ü–∏–º–ø–∏–Ω–µ–ª–ª–∞: –§–ª–æ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è), Allegretto molto moderato (G major, 135 bars) Origin of lyrics The lyrics of the first four songs are from writings of Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy (1817 ‚Äì 1875), the Russian poet, novelist and playwright.Brown, David. Tchaikovsky: The final years, 1885-1893, p. 501 (W. W. Norton & Company, 1991). For example, the first song is based on Tolstoy's 1862 drama Don Juan. The lyrics for \\"The Love of a Dead Man\\" are from Mikhail Lermontov (1814 ‚Äì 1841), the Russian writer, poet and painter. And, the lyrics for \\"Pimpinella\\" are by Tchaikovsky, based upon a Florentine popular song. Composition and dedication The six songs are not in chronological order of composition. He wrote the last two (\\"The Love of a Dead Man\\" and \\"Pimpinella\\") while visiting Florence in February and March 1878, respectively.To my best friend: correspondence between Tchaikovsky and Nadezhda von Meck, 1876-1878, pp. 177-179 (Oxford U. Press, 1993).Chaaeikovskiaei, P. and Sylvester, Richard. Tchaikovsky's Complete Songs: A Companion with Texts and Translations, pp. 111, 125 (Indiana University Press, 2004). Later, he wrote the first four songs (based on Tolstoy) in May 1878 while visiting the Ukrainian estate of his benefactor, Nadezhda von Meck (1831 ‚Äì 1894), who previously suggested he might want to put Tolstoy to music. The opus was dedicated to Anatoly, one of the composer's brothers, in gratitude for helping Tchaikovsky through a difficult emotional period in 1877. It was during that year when the composer married and separated from Antonina Miliukova (1848 ‚Äì 1917).Wiley, Roland. Tchaikovsky, p. 197 (Oxford University Press, 2009).
