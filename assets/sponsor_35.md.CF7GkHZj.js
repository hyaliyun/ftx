Career Born in Rio de Janeiro, he was a talented midfielder, who played for Clube de Regatas do Flamengo between 1975 and 1987, during the most glorious years in the history of the G√°vea club. During those years, he won virtually every competition he disputed: the Rio State Championship in 1978, 1979 (twice), 1981 and 1986; the S√©rie A in 1980, 1982, 1983 and 1987; the 1981 Libertadores Cup, and the Intercontinental Cup, when he scored one of the goals of Flamengo's 3-0 victory against England's Liverpool. Ad√≠lio played 181 S√©rie A games for Flamengo, scoring 26 goals, and played 11 S√©rie A games for Coritiba, without scoring a goal. Ad√≠lio also played for Coritiba in 1987 and 1988, Barcelona de Guayaquil of Ecuador, in 1989, Alianza Lima of Peru, in 1991 and 1992, and Borussia Fulda of Germany in 1996, besides some smaller clubs in Rio de Janeiro state, like Am√©rica de Tr√™s Rios in 1994, Barreira in 1995 and in 1996, Friburguense in 1996 and Barra Mansa in 1997. He played for Itumbiara in 1991, Santos-ES in 1993, and Bacabal and Serrano in 1995. Having played 611 matches for Flamengo, Ad√≠lio is the third player with most appearances for the club. =National team= Ad√≠lio played two games for the Brazilian national team. The first game was played on July 5, 1979, against a Bahia state combined team, while the last game was played on March 21, 1982, against West Germany. =As a coach= After retiring from playing, Ad√≠lio began to devote himself to coaching. His first experience was the front of Saudi Bahain, soon after, as Brown is affectionately called, took command of the CFZ, his companion of old Zico. In 2003 the former player accepted an invitation from Flamengo to take command of the basic categories. Back in her crib, Adilio played an enviable job in front of the red and black boys. In four years in junior, he was champion in Rio, OPG Cup double champion, champion of the Rio-S√£o Paulo and Belo Horizonte Cup, and placed third in the World Cup in Malaysia. Also helped form players of the caliber of Renato Augusto, Erick Flores, Thiago Sales, and midfielder R√¥mulo. In this work period at Flamengo, Adilio had one that was perhaps its greatest opportunity in the coaching career when he was driven to take the senior team in 2006. The team that had remained wildly in S√©rie A of 2005, thanks to the good offices of Joel Santana, had lost its commander and is now coached by Ad√≠lio. Experience, however, failed. The team played two matches Ad√≠lio and lost to both New Delhi and Cabofriense respectively. After this, the former player came back to coach the team base. In 2008, after spending a season in white, Adilio was passed over the post and gave way to Rog√©rio Louren√ßo.

In late 1789, de Ribas's grenadiers captured Khadjibey (the village on the future site of Odessa) without a battle: \\"It was, in fact, one of the great non-battles of the war. The entire affair lasted no more than half an hour. The Ottoman garrison, a few-dozen startled soldiers and their senior officer, surrendered on the spot.\\"King, Odessa, p. 48. His greatest deed was the storming of Izmail in 1790 under the supreme command of Alexander Suvorov. De Ribas proposed a plan of attack, which was approved by Suvorov, and led both Russian navy and land forces to capture the mighty fortress. The defeat was seen as a catastrophe in the Ottoman Empire, while in Russia it was glorified in the country's early, unofficial national anthem, \\"Let the thunder of victory sound!\\". In 1791 de Ribas was promoted to rear admiral and commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. He was promoted to vice admiral in 1795 and to full admiral in 1796. Shortly after the end of the war, he proposed a plan to Catherine of transforming the Ottoman garrison town of Khadjibey into a major Russian port with an ice-free harbor; she accepted the idea, and on 27 May 1794 she issued an edict ordering its development as a commercial and shipping center and naming de Ribas the chief administrator (glavnyi nachal'nik) of the project. He began constructing stone houses and administrative buildings and may have been the one to suggest naming the city after the ancient Greek town of Odessos (though Catherine is said to have insisted on a feminine ending, making it Odessa).King, Odessa, pp. 51-52. As a son-in-law of Ivan Betskoy and a secretary to Prince Potemkin, he became one of the earliest administrators of the New Russia. He may have been involved in the conspiracy to overthrow Emperor Paul, but died several months before the coup took place.

Another source gives an estimate of some 800,000 Brazilians living in the U.S. in 2000, while still another estimates that some 1,100,000 Brazilians live in the United States, 300,000 of them in Florida. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, There are a total of 42,193,781 foreign born persons in the United States. From the 42.2 million immigrants, 350,091 are Brazilians, corresponding 0.83% (350,091/42.2million) of the foreign born population. While the official United States Census category of Hispanic or Latino includes persons of South American origin, it also refers to persons of \\"other Spanish culture,\\" creating some ambiguity about whether Brazilians, who are of South American origin but do not have a Spanish culture, qualify as Latino, and they are not \\"Hispanic\\" (although the term encompasses the entire Iberian Peninsula but usually refers a culture derived from Spain as in Spanish language), they are \\"Latino\\" (which is short for latinoamericano). Other U.S. government agencies, such as the Small Business Administration and the Department of Transportation, specifically include Brazilians within their definitions of Hispanic and Latino for purposes of awarding minority preferences by defining Hispanic Americans to include persons of South American ancestry or persons who have Portuguese cultural roots.  History  People from what is now Brazil (from ancient Jo√£o Pessoa and Recife under Dutch control in Northeast Brazil - Para√≠ba and Pernambuco states) are recorded among the Refugees and Settlers that arrived in New Netherland in what is now New York City in the 17th Century among the Dutch West India Company settlers. The first arrivals of Brazilian emigres were formally recorded in the 1940s. Previously, Brazilians were not identified separately from other South Americans. Of approximately 234,761 South American emigres arrived in the United States between 1820 and 1960, at least some of them were Brazilian. The 1960 United States Census report recorded 27,885 Americans of Brazilian ancestry. From 1960 until the mid-1980s, between 1,500 and 2,300 Brazilian immigrants arrived in the United States each year. During the mid-1980s, economic crisis struck Brazil. As a result, between 1986 and 1990 approximately 1.4 million Brazilians emigrated to other parts of the world. It was not until this time that Brazilian emigration reached significant levels. Thus, between 1987 and 1991, an estimated 20,800 Brazilians arrived in the United States. A significant number of them, 8,133 Brazilians, arrived in 1991. The 1990 U.S. Census Bureau recorded that there are about 60,000 Brazilians living in the United States. However, other sources indicate that there are nearly 100,000 Brazilians living in the New York City metropolitan area (including Northern New Jersey) alone, in addition to sizable Brazilian communities in Atlanta, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Miami, Houston, and Phoenix. There are many hypothesis regarding the formation of Brazilian migration to the United States. Ana Cristina Martes, a professor of sociology at Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas Brazil, helped explain the first few migratory trips to the U.S. which took place in Boston. She noticed a series of six events that could have led the cycle of migration: # During World War II, American engineers from the Boston area travelled to Governador Valadares [a city in Minas Gerais, Brazil] ‚Ä¶to work on the region‚Äôs mineral extraction and railroad‚Ä¶When they came back to the States, many of them brought their Brazilian domestic employees. # After the war, some Bostonians strengthen the relationship with Valadares [by coming back on more trips for more precious stones]. # In the 1960s, newspapers from Rio [De Janeiro] and Sao Paulo published a number of ads offering jobs to Brazilian women interested in working as maids in Boston. # [During the same time period, a business man from Massachusetts] hired twenty soccer players from Belo Horizonte to form a soccer team. Many of them stayed permanently and helped their family join them in the States. # At the end of the decade, a group of more than ten young people from Governador Valadares decided to come to the States to spend more time on ‚Äòan adventurous trip‚Ä¶in a country of their dreams‚Äô. They also settled permanently and helped their families join them. # ‚Ä¶several Brazilians came to study in Boston and decided not to return to Brazil. Before the 1960s there was insignificant movement from Brazil to the United States. It was between the 1960s through 1980s that some Brazilians went to the United States as tourists to visit places such as Disney World, New York and other tourist destinations. Brazilians travelled during that time because the country was growing at an average 7% annually and projecting 4% annual increase in GDP per capita. After the 1980s, the peak of the economic cycle quickly dropped to a long lasting through. The Brazilian Federal Police reported that in the 1980s about 1.25 million people (1% of the population) emigrated to countries such as the U.S. This was the first time Brazilians emigrated in significant numbers. They wanted to stay in the States until the crisis was over. They also had some work connections and known opportunities in the East Coast, which increased facilitated the move. In 1980, there were 41,000 Brazilians and 82,000 by 1990. Neoclassical Economics Theory explains the beginning flow of migration in 1980 indicating that individuals were rational actors who looked for better opportunities away from home to improve his/her lifestyle. Since the crisis hit the Brazilian middle class hard, many chose to leave to optimize their income, find better jobs, and more stable social conditions by doing marginal benefit analysis.UN Human Development Report, 2009, Chapter 2, sections 2.1 and 2.2 There was another wave of emigration in 2002 where Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimated that 1.96 million Brazilians had left again as the country continued to lack economic stability. This number reflected another 1% of the Brazilian population 22 years later (‚ÄúPopulation, total‚Äù). This wave of migration was different from the one in the 1980s. As shown by Martes‚Äô research, migration evolved even more with a creation and better establishment of social networks. When Bostonians first brought back a wave of Brazilian domestic workers, Brazilians would send information to their homes about their experiences and opportunities. This connection is what Douglas Massey defined as Social Capital Theory. Migrants create social ties in the host country facilitating the move at lower cost and creating an incentive to join their community in another country.Massey, Douglas S. 1999. ‚ÄúWhy Does Immigration Occur? A Theoretical Synthesis.\\" Pp. 34-52 in The Handbook of International Migration: The American Experience, edited by C. Hirschman, P. Kasinitz and J. DeWind. New York: Russell Sage Foundation. Legal migrants who had entered the U.S. brought their immediate relatives resulting in an increase of the Brazilian immigrant population.  Lawful Permanent Resident Status  The figure portrays a historical pattern of Brazilians obtaining lawful permanent resident status. Each bar represents a 10-year fiscal period. The last 6 years accumulated 80,741 persons obtaining permanent status. The number of persons from 2010-2020 will more likely reflect the 10-year fiscal period from 2000-2009. However, the number of people will increase slightly at a much lower rate than from 1990-1999 to 2000-2009. Source: Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2016. Brazilians obtained the highest number of lawful permanent residence status between 2000 and 2009 and many were eligible to naturalize. During that time, 115,404 Brazilians received permanent status and from 2010 through 2016, already 80,741 persons had received theirs. Still, it seems as if many received status, but if you compare to the total foreign born Brazilian population, the numbers are small. In 2010 the Brazilian foreign born population was 340,000 and only 12,057 (or 4% of) persons obtained legal status. Of the 336,000 foreign born Brazilians in 2014, only 10,246 (or 3%) received permanent status in the same year. Even though few people are obtaining permanent status, there was a noticeable spike previously mentioned between 2000-2009. The increase in acceptance was due to two main factors: the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act and economic and political turmoil in Brazil. The top three classes of admissions for Brazilians obtaining lawful permanent status in the U.S. in 2016 was family-sponsored, employment, and immediate relatives of U.S. citizens. Each category of admissions makes up of 4%, 25%, and 68% respectively of the total individuals.  Socioeconomics  = Education = The 2000 U.S. Census showed that 34.5 percent of Brazilians had completed four or more years of college, while the corresponding number for the general U.S. population is only 24.4 percent. However, although effectively many Brazilian immigrants in the United States are university educated, most of these immigrants fail to get well-qualified jobs and have to get lower-status jobs because the United States doesn't recognize their qualifications and also because many of them do not speak English. Second-and third-generation Brazilian Americans tend to have better jobs; they have been educated in the United States, speak English, and have citizenship.  Culture  = Religion = Although the majority of Brazilian Americans are Roman Catholic, there also significant numbers of Protestants, Mormons, Brazilian Catholics not in communion with Rome, Orthodox, Irreligious people (including atheists and agnostics), followed by minorities such as Spiritists, Buddhists, Jews and Muslims. As with wider Brazilian culture, there is set of beliefs related through syncretism that might be described as part of a Spiritualism‚ÄìAnimism continuum, that includes: Spiritism (or Kardecism, a form of spiritualism that originated in France, often confused with other beliefs also called , distinguished from them by the term ), Umbanda (a syncretic religion mixing African animist beliefs and rituals with Catholicism, Spiritism, and indigenous lore), Candombl√© (a syncretic religion that originated in the Brazilian state of Bahia and that combines African animist beliefs with elements of Catholicism), and Santo Daime (created in the state of Acre in the 1930s by Mestre Irineu (also known as Raimundo Irineu Serra) it is a syncretic mix of Folk Catholicism, Kardecist Spiritism, Afro-Brazilian religions and a more recent incorporation of Indigenous American practices and rites). People who profess Spiritism make up 1.3% of the country's population, and those professing Afro-Brazilian religions make up 0.3% of the country's population.  Demographics  Brazilians began immigrating to the United States in large and increasing numbers in the 1980s as a result of worsening economic conditions in Brazil at that time. However, many of the Brazilians who have emigrated to the United States since this decade have been undocumented. More women have immigrated to the United States from Brazil than men, with the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Censuses showing there to be ten percent more female than male Brazilian Americans. The top three metropolitan areas by Brazilian population are New York City (72,635), Boston (63,930), and Miami (43,930). Brazilians obtaining lawful permanent resident status by the top 6 states in the United States. Source: Yearbook of Immigration Statistics 2016 =Racial stereotype and Representation in the media= Like ethnic terms Hispanic and Latino, in popular use, Brazilian is often mistakenly given racial values, usually non- white and mixed race, such as half-caste or mulatto, in spite of the racial diversity of Brazilian Americans. Brazilians commonly draw ancestry from European, Indigenous populations, and African populations in different proportions; many Brazilians are largely of European ancestry, and some are predominantly of Native Brazilian Indian origin, or African origins, but a large number of Brazilians are descended from an admixture of two, three or more origins. Paradoxically, it is common for them to be stereotyped as being exclusively non-white due merely to their Latin background of country of origin, regardless of whether their ancestry is European or not. On the other hand, the white Brazilian Americans who are perceived by Americans as \\"Brazilian\\" usually possess typical Mediterranean/Southern European pigmentation - olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes - as most white Brazilian immigrants are and most white Brazilian Americans are; the same situation happens for Portuguese Americans who are perceived by Americans as such, as most Portuguese immigrants are. Because Americans associate Brazilian origin with brown skin, Hollywood typically casts Brazilian Americans with conventionally Mediterranean features as non-Brazilian white. = Brazilian American communities = * New York City is a leading point of entry for Brazilians entering the United States. West 46th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Manhattan has been designated Little Brazil has historically been a commercial center for Brazilians living in or visiting New York City. Another NYC neighborhood home to many Brazilian Americans is located in Astoria, Queens. Newark, New Jersey is also home to many Brazilian and Portuguese-Americans, most prominently in the city's Ironbound district. *Massachusetts, particularly the Boston metropolitan area, has a sizable Brazilian immigrant population. Framingham has the highest percentage of Brazilians of any municipality in Massachusetts. Somerville has the highest number of Brazilians of any municipality in Massachusetts. Large populations also exist in Everett, Barnstable, Lowell, Marlboro, Malden, Shrewsbury, Worcester, Milford, Fitchburg, Leominster, Falmouth, Hudson, Revere, Edgartown, Lancaster, Dennisport, Chelsea, Lawrence, Vineyard Haven, Oak Bluffs, Millbury, and Leicester. * Florida's large Brazilian community is mostly centered around the southeastern corridor, particularly the islands and northeastern section of Miami-Dade County (North Bay Village, Bay Harbor Islands, Miami Beach, Surfside, Key Biscayne, Aventura, and Sunny Isles Beach) with the exception of Doral. In Broward County, the population is centered on the northeastern part as well (Deerfield Beach, Pompano Beach, Oakland Park, Coconut Creek, Lighthouse Point, and Sea Ranch Lakes), with some living on the border of Palm Beach County. There are also many Brazilians living in Orange County and Osceola County, particularly in the cities of Orlando and Kissimmee. * Philadelphia, Pennsylvania has a vibrant Brazilian community, mostly settling in the Northeast section of the city, in communities such as Oxford Circle, Summerdale, Frankford, Juniata Park, Lawndale, Fox Chase, and Rhawnhurst. Many of the Brazilian residents started to come to Philadelphia during the early 2000s, opening restaurants, boutiques, supermarkets, and other stores along Bustleton, Castor, and Cottman Avenues. There's also smaller, but highly concentrated Brazilian communities such as Riverside, Delran, Cinnaminson, Palmyra, Delanco, Beverly, Edgewater Park, and Burlington. * Los Angeles, California's Brazilian residents have tended to settle, if not form distinct ethnic enclaves in, the county's southern beach cities (Venice, Los Angeles; and suburbs of Lawndale; Long Beach; Manhattan Beach; and Redondo Beach) and Westside neighborhoods near and south of the 10 (Palms, Los Angeles; Rancho Park, Los Angeles; and West Los Angeles; and the suburb of Culver City). The city's greatest concentration of Brazilian American businesses began appearing in the late 1980s along Venice Boulevard's north border between Culver City and Palms (between Overland Avenue and Sepulveda Avenue). * Chicago, Illinois' Brazilian population began with the migration of Portuguese Sephardi Jews who had fled to Brazil during the World War II era. After World War II, many Sephardim successfully circumvented restrictive U.S. immigration laws, to join the large and largely Ashkenazi population in the Chicago area. However, it was not until the 1970s, did a visible Brazilian community begin to develop in Chicago. The Flyers Soccer Club was founded by a group of young men who desired to bring Brazilian soccer culture to the Chicago area. The Flyers Soccer Club eventually transformed into a multifaceted community organization called the Luso-Brazilian Club. The group was headquartered in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood. The group declined in the late 1980s. As Brazilians emigrated to the United States in large numbers in the 1980s and 1990s, Chicago's Brazilian population remained comparatively small, numbering no more than several thousand people by 2000. The FIFA World Cups have attracted the attention of Chicago's Brazilian population through the years, leading to the development of some Brazilian soccer-interested gatherings in the area. =U.S. communities with high percentages of people of Brazilian ancestry= According to ePodunk, a website, the top 50 U.S. communities with the highest percentages of people claiming Brazilian ancestry are: # North Bay Village, Florida 6.00% # Riverside, New Jersey 5.00% # Danbury, Connecticut 4.90% # Harrison, New Jersey 4.80% # Framingham, Massachusetts 4.80% # Somerville, Massachusetts 4.50% # Kearny, New Jersey 3.70% # Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts 3.60% # Deerfield Beach, Florida 3.50% # Everett, Massachusetts 3.20% # Marlborough, Massachusetts 3.10% # Long Branch, New Jersey 2.80% # Edgartown, Massachusetts 2.70% # Newark, New Jersey 2.50% # Doral, Florida 2.50% # Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts 2.50% # Miami Beach, Florida 2.20% # Hillside, New Jersey 2.20% # Hudson, Massachusetts 2.20% # Oakland Park, Florida 2.10% # South River, New Jersey 2.10% # Cliffside Park, New Jersey2.10% # Tisbury, Massachusetts 2.10% # Fairview, New Jersey 2.00% # Aventura, Florida 1.90% # Lauramie, Indiana 1.80% # Revere, Massachusetts 1.70% # Malden, Massachusetts 1.70% # Sea Ranch Lakes, Florida 1.70% # Surfside, Florida 1.60% # Barnstable, Massachusetts 1.60% # Lowell, Massachusetts 1.60% # Ojus, Florida 1.60% # Washington, Ohio 1.60% # Naugatuck, Connecticut 1.60% # Milford, Massachusetts 1.50% # Dennis Port, Massachusetts 1.50% # Keene, Texas 1.50% # Key Biscayne, Florida 1.50% # Mount Vernon, New York 1.50% # Avondale Estates, Georgia 1.50% # Sunny Isles Beach, Florida 1.50% # Riverside, New Jersey 1.40% # Trenton, Florida 1.40% # South Lancaster, Massachusetts 1.30% # Great River, New York 1.30% # Port Chester, New York 1.30% # Coconut Creek, Florida 1.20% # Belle Isle, Florida 1.20% # Big Pine Key, Florida 1.20% # Chelsea, Massachusetts 1.20% =U.S. communities with the most residents born in Brazil= According to the social networking and information website City-Data, the top 25 U.S. communities with the highest percentage of residents born in Brazil are: # Loch Lomond, Florida 15.8% # Bonnie Loch-Woodsetter North, Florida 7.2% # North Bay Village, Florida 7.1% # East Newark, New Jersey 6.7% # Framingham, Massachusetts 6.6% # Harrison, New Jersey 5.8% # Danbury, Connecticut 5.6% # Somerville, Massachusetts 5.4% # Sunshine Ranches, Florida 5.1% # Flying Hills, Pennsylvania 5.1% # Deerfield Beach, Florida 4.7% # Fox River, Alaska 4.5% # Edgartown, Massachusetts 4.4% # West Yarmouth, Massachusetts 4.4% # Marlborough, Massachusetts 4.4% # Kearny, New Jersey 4.4% # Doral, Florida 4.1% # Everett, Massachusetts 4.0% # Long Branch, New Jersey 3.7% # Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts 3.4% # Hudson, Massachusetts 3.2% # Miami Beach, Florida 3.1% # Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts 3.0% # Oakland Park, Florida 3.0% # Pompano Beach Highlands, Florida 3.0% Some City-Data information contradicts official government data from the Census Bureau. It is important to be mindful that Brazilian Americans sometimes decline to identify as Latino. Therefore, the above estimates may outnumber the Census data figures for Hispanics and/or Latinos for the above Census areas.  Relations with Brazil  Voting Brazilian Americans and Brazilians abroad heavily favored the opposition's Aecio Neves and his pro-business centre to centre-right Brazilian Social Democracy Party in Brazil's 2014 general election. Aecio Neves and the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, or PSDB, were narrowly defeated in the 2014 runoff. Brazilian Americans represent a large source of remittances to Brazil. Brazil receives approximately one quarter of its remittances from the U.S. (26% in 2012), out of a total amount of $4.9 billion received in 2012.

He was the Member of Parliament for Edmonton Centre from 2006 until 2015. He served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence from October 10, 2007 until May 24, 2011. Hawn announced in March 2014 that he was not running for re-election.  Early life and career  Hawn joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1964 and received his pilot wings at Gimli, Manitoba in January 1967. He flew the Canadair T-33 Silver Star as an instructor pilot and as a tactical fighter pilot and instructor on the Canadair CF-104 Starfighter and was among the first Canadian military pilots to fly the McDonnell Douglas CF-18 Hornet fighters. In thirty years in the Air Force, Hawn rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and he then served an additional five years as honorary colonel of 417 Combat Support Squadron. Hawn commanded a Hornet equipped tactical fighter squadron at CFB Cold Lake. When he retired in 1994 Hawn entered the financial services business where he opened and managed branch offices. Hawn is a founding member of the Investment Advisors Association of Canada. Hawn is married; they have two children, and two grandchildren. Member of Parliament In January 2004 Hawn stood for election as a Member of Parliament in the constituency of Edmonton Centre. His opponent in the 2004 election was the sitting Member of Parliament and Deputy Prime Minister, Anne McLellan, but Hawn failed to get elected by a few hundred votes. He continued to campaign and maintain an interest in politics in the 2006 election he stood again against McLellan. On January 23, 2006, he was elected as the representative of Edmonton Centre. Hawn was appointed to the standing committee on National Defence, as well as the committee on Public Safety and National Security. In October 2007 Hawn was appointed the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Peter MacKay. In the Canadian parliamentary system, Parliamentary Secretaries act as a liaison between the government and House of Commons. Laurie Hawn was a Canadian representative and a co-chair of the Permanent Canada-United States Joint Board of Defence as of 2012. Also, Hawn sat on the Treasury Board sub-committee on the Strategic and Operating Review. Hawn has also won subsequent elections for Edmonton Centre in 2008 and 2011. Hawn chose not to run for re-election in the 2015 Federal Election. In January 2016, Laurie Hawn was appointed to the Edmonton Police Commission. Honours On October 1, 2010, Hawn was appointed to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada in recognition of \\"many years of dedication and hard work in the House of Commons, including on Canada‚Äôs engagement in Afghanistan\\". For his military service he received the Canadian Forces Decoration with 2 Bars.

It does some symbolic calculus (derivative, extrema, Taylor series, and polynomial integration and Laplace transforms), numerical integration, and handles all elementary algebra except logarithms. Trigonometric functions can be entered and manipulated using complex exponentials, with the GNU m4 preprocessor. Not currently implemented are general functions like f(x), arbitrary-precision and interval arithmetic, and matrices. Features Mathomatic excels at solving, differentiating, simplifying, calculating, and visualizing elementary algebra. It also does summations, products, and automated display of calculations of any length by plugging sequential or test values into any formula, then approximating and simplifying before display. Intermediate results (showing the work) may be displayed by previously typing \\"set debug 1\\" (see the session example); this works for solving and almost every command in Mathomatic. \\"set debug 2\\" reveals even more details about the work done. The software does not include a GUI except with the Mathomatic trademark authorized, versions for smartphones and tablets running iOS or Android. The free Mathomatic software, available on the official Mathomatic website, is authorized for use in any other type of software, due to its permissive free software license (GNU LGPL). It is available as a free software library, and as a free console mode application that uses a color command-line interface with pretty-print output that runs in a terminal emulator under any operating system. The console interface is very simple and requires little more than learning the basic algebra notation to get started. All input and output is line-at-a-time ASCII text. By default, input is standard input and output is standard output. Mathomatic is typically compiled with editline or GNU readline for easier input. There is no programming capability; the interpreter works like an algebraic calculator. Expressions and equations are entered in standard algebraic infix notation. Operations are performed on them by entering simple English commands. Because all numeric arithmetic is double precision floating point, and round-off error is not tracked, Mathomatic is not suitable for applications requiring high precision, such as astronomical calculations. It is useful for symbolic-numeric calculations of about 14 decimal digits accuracy, although many results will be exact, if possible. Mathomatic can be used as a floating point or integer arithmetic code generating tool, simplifying and converting equations into optimized assignment statements in the Python, C, and Java programming languages. The output can be made compatible with most other mathematics programs, except TeX and MathML format input/output are currently not available. The ASCII characters that are allowed in Mathomatic variable names is configurable, allowing TeX format variable names. The Mathomatic source code can be compiled as a symbolic math library with a very simple API, which can be linked to C compatible programs that need to use the Mathomatic symbolic math engine.

Afterwards it was released as shareware and then emailware, with a 2D equation graphing program. At the turn of the century, Mathomatic was ported to the GNU C Compiler under Linux and became free software. The graphing program was discontinued; 2D/3D graphing of equations is now accomplished with gnuplot. The name \\"Mathomatic\\" is a portmanteau of \\"math\\" and \\"automatic\\", and was inspired by the naming and automation of Rog-O-Matic, which was an early experiment in artificial intelligence.

There is a port to JavaScript using Emscripten, allowing Mathomatic to run in a web browser. The ports are all maintained by separate individuals. Requirements Building from source requires a C compiler with the standard POSIX C libraries. If Mathomatic is compiled with the GCC C compiler or the Tiny C Compiler for a Unix-like operating system, no changes need to be made to the source code. Mathomatic uses no special GCC only code, so it will usually compile easily with any C compiler. Use of the Mathomatic Symbolic Math Library allows mixing programming languages and is operating system independent. Mathomatic can be ported to any computer with at least 1 megabyte of free RAM. The Mathomatic standard distributionFound on the Mathomatic website. Mathomatic.org. Retrieved on 29 November 2011. memory requirement defaults to a maximum of 400 megabytes, depending on the size of the equation spaces and how many expressions have been entered. Equation spaces are fixed size arrays that are allocated as needed, the size of which is set during compilation or startup. Each algebraic expression or equation entered at the main prompt is stored in an equation space. Mathomatic is written to do most symbolic manipulations with memory moves, like an assembly language program. This causes Mathomatic to crash when used with the new LLVM backend, which doesn't seem to like the standard C library function memmove(3). To use Mathomatic with a C compiler that uses an LLVM backend, disable all optimizations with \\"-O0\\" on the C compiler command line. Otherwise the regression tests will loop endlessly. This is most certainly an optimization bug in LLVM. To help those trying to debug this optimization error, Mathomatic will fail when LLVM optimizes the simplification of (32^.5) to 4*(2^.5), and the like, going into an endless loop every time.

It has dialects across Brazil reflecting regional and sociocultural differences. A strong sign language law was passed by the National Congress of Brazil on April 24, 2002, and (in 2005) is in the process of being implemented.LIBRAS law (in Portuguese) The law mandates the use of Brazilian Sign Language in education and government services. Signwriting used on outside of school for deaf in Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul Educational approaches have evolved from oralism to Total Communication and bilingualism. Alphabet BSL fingerspelling uses a one-handed manual alphabet similar to that used by the French Sign Language family.LIBRAS manual alphabet There are 44 distinct handshapes used in the language. Writing Sutton SignWriting is the dominant writing system in Brazil. A master's in linguistics dissertation titled \\"A arte de escrever em Libras\\" by Gabriela Otaviani Barbosa found that SignWriting is used in 18 Federal Universities and in 12 public schools in Brazil. The History of SignWriting in Brazil appeared on TV INES in 2017: \\"A Vida em Libras ‚Äì SignWriting ‚Äì Escrita de Sinais\\". Historical efforts were commonly transcribed using Portuguese words, written in upper case, to stand for each equivalent BSL morpheme. Transcription of BSL signs using SignWriting has been in place since at least 1997 with the SignNet Project in Porto Alegre and Fernando Capovilla's dictionaries in S√£o Paulo. The University of Santa Catarina at Florianopolis (UFSC) has required courses in SignWriting as the preferred form of LIBRAS transcription. SignWriting is cited as being useful in the pedagogy of young children. http://www.signwriting.org/archive/docs6/sw0580_BR_Aquisicao_Escrita_Sinais_2007.pdf The Federal University of Santa Catarina has accepted a dissertation written in Brazilian Sign Language using Sutton SignWriting for a master's degree in linguistics. The dissertation \\"The Writing of Grammatical Non-Manual Expressions in Sentences in LIBRAS Using the SignWriting System\\" by Jo√£o Paulo Ampessan states that \\"the data indicate the need for [non-manual expressions] usage in writing sign language\\". Deaf and sign language organizations The most important deaf organization is FENEIS, the Federa√ß√£o Nacional de Educa√ß√£o e Integra√ß√£o dos Surdos (National Federation of Deaf Education and Integration). There are a number of regional organizations in Curitiba, Caxias do Sul and Rio Grande do Sul.

The facility features nearly 100 aircraft, as well as engines, models, artifacts, photographs, and paintings. In addition, the Southern Museum of Flight is home to the Alabama Aviation Hall of Fame, which presents Alabama Aviation History through collective biography. Overview Notable aircraft on display include a Wright Flyer, Curtis Pusher, Fokker D-VII, Alexander Eaglerock, F-4 Phantom, F-86 Sabre, AH-1 Cobra, Soviet-built MiGs, Mi-24 Hind, A-12 Blackbird spy plane, the \\"Lake Murray\\" B-25, and an array of experimental aircraft. The Lake Murray B-25C Mitchell bomber crashed in South Carolina during a 1943 training exercise. The right engine was torn off during the crash but the crew was able to escape unharmed before she sank to a depth of 150 feet (46m). The aircraft became a dive site for local technical divers until she was raised from the depths of the lake in September 2005. Dr. Bob Seigler who spearheaded the project, John Hodge and Dr. Bill Vartorella, formed the Lake Murray B-25 Rescue Project to salvage the aircraft from the bottom of Lake Murray. After recovery the remains of the aircraft were moved to the Southern Museum of Flight in Birmingham, Alabama for conservation and museum display. A video crew, including maritime video experts from Nautilus Productions, documented the recovery for the Mega Movers series on the History Channel. Featured on display is a diorama exhibit honoring Alabama's famed Tuskegee Airmen, as well as the Korean War Jets Exhibit and Vietnam War Helicopters Exhibit.

Design and development The single engine, tandem, two seat I-12 was a development of the similarly laid out I-11, strengthened for aerobatics. It was an all wood low wing monoplane, entirely plywood covered apart from the tail control surfaces and with a fixed, conventional undercarriage. Its cantilever wing was built around a main and an auxiliary box spar, both made from spruce and plywood. The short wing centre section was integral with the fuselage, with the main undercarriage legs on it. These and the wheels, fitted with brakes, were faired. Outboard, the wing panels tapered to rounded tips, carrying both the balanced and slotted differential ailerons and hand-operated camber-changing split flaps. The fuselage was a rectangular box formed from spruce longerons, with a ply roof behind the cabin, where a long, multipart canopy enclosed the pilot and passenger's seats. The pilot sat at the rear; both had removable sections for access. In front of them the Blackburn Cirrus four cylinder in-line, inverted engine was mounted on steel bearers, driving a wooden propeller. At the rear of the fuselage the empennage was conventional, with the tailplane mounted on the fin above the fuselage line and braced from below with a steel strut on each side. The elevators were hinged forward of the rudder, which carried a trim tab, but were shaped to allow its movement as it extended to the keel. Operational history The I-12 first flew on 26 June 1937, the first of twelve examples built. The first prototype, on a European tour begun in July 1937, made several demonstrations in Paris. In the UK it raced at Ramsgate, coming fifth in the handicapped Thanet Air Race at Ramsgate, as well as winning first prize for the best turned out aircraft. Late in August it came in second in the Cinque Ports Wakefield Cup races at Lympne. Its tour ended the following July, flown back to Riga by P. Avery in a record nine hours, non-stop from London. Avery flew another I-12 in 1939, coming fifth in the London to Isle of Man race and competing in the Isle of Man competition in May. The I-12 was enthusiastically reviewed by the British aeronautical press and Rollasons were designated as distributors after the I-12 had been adjusted to met UK certification requirements. It was also offered on sale in the UK by D.R.P. Engines at ¬£750 but no examples reached the UK civil register. At least four were purchased as trainers by the Aizsargi in early 1938, most surviving to the Soviet occupation of 1940.

It is thought to have originated in the 16th or 17th century. The word \\"fum\\" means smoke in Catalan, and it may simply refer to the smoke rising from a chimney as seen from afar, or, as indicated in the New Oxford Book of Carols, \\"may imitate the sound of a drum (or perhaps the strumming of a guitar)\\".New Oxford Book of Carols It is not typical of Spanish tradition but rather of Catalan tradition. Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) defines \\"fum\\" as \\"to play upon a fiddle,\\" quoting Ben Jonson, \\"Follow me, and fum as you go.\\"Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary (1913) One source, the Musical Heritage Society insert 3428 (Christmas Songs From Around the World), indicates that \\"fum, fum, fum\\" is an onomatopoeia imitating the noise of a rocking cradle, and that the rhythms come from the Sardana, a courtly dance which originated in Catalonia and the Provence.  Lyrics  The English version is not really a translation but a version based on the traditional Catalan carol, created by Alice Parker and Robert Shaw in 1953.

Red Arrows air display team 2005 X Games parachutist of the UK Lightning Bolts Army Parachute Display Team Colored smoke can be used for smoke signals, often in a military context. It can be produced by smoke grenades, or by various other pyrotechnical devices. The mixture used for producing colored smoke is usually a cooler-burning formula based on potassium chlorate oxidizer, lactose or dextrin as a fuel, and one or more dyes, with about 40-50% content of the dye. About 2% sodium bicarbonate may be added as a coolant, to lower the burning temperature. Coloured smoke was first used in 1967 during an American burnout competition by a small contestant, as a means to wow the crowd. Smoke released from aircraft was originally based on a mixture of 10-15% dye, 60-65% trichloroethylene or tetrachloroethylene, and 25% diesel oil, injected into the exhaust gases of the aircraft engines. Most commonly, teams now use specifically prepared liquid dyes and only gas oil, light mineral oil or a food grade white oil without harmful chlorinated solvents.

Meyer (born 1956) is an American producer and writer. Meyer is best known for his work on The Simpsons, where he led the group script rewrite sessions. He has been publicly credited with \\"thoroughly shap[ing] ... the comedic sensibility\\" of the show. Raised in Tucson, Meyer attended Harvard University. There, after becoming president of the Harvard Lampoon, he graduated in 1978 with a degree in biochemistry. Abandoning plans to attend medical school, Meyer attempted to make money through dog racing but failed after two months. After a series of short-term jobs he was hired in 1981 by David Letterman, on the advice of two of Meyer's Harvard Lampoon cowriters, to join the writing team of his show Late Night with David Letterman. Meyer left after two seasons and went on to write for The New Show, Not Necessarily the News and Saturday Night Live. Tired of life in New York, Meyer moved to Boulder, Colorado where he wrote a screenplay for a film for Letterman to star in. The project fell through and Meyer then founded the humor zine Army Man which garnered a strong following, although Meyer ended it after three issues. The producer Sam Simon was a fan and he hired Meyer to write for the animated sitcom The Simpsons in 1989. He has held a number of positions on the show and also cowrote The Simpsons Movie. Meyer is in a relationship with the writer Maria Semple and the two have a daughter. Early life and education Born in Pennsylvania, United States in 1956, Meyer grew up in Tucson, Arizona. He is the eldest of eight children in a Roman Catholic family of German ancestry. His parents both worked in the real estate business. Meyer has made jokes about his somewhat unhappy childhood, stating that one common argument in his household was \\"which family member ruined a holiday\\",The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season. DVD commentary for Episode 7F07 \\"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\\" while his sister noted Meyer was frequently blamed for the family's problems. Due to its size, family activities were limited so Meyer watched lots of television and read Mad magazine. He is an Eagle Scout and an altar boy and wrote for the student newspaper. He grew up hoping to one day become either a priest or ballplayer. He was uninterested in television, only finding humor in Get Smart and Batman, where he appreciated its \\"loopy, irreverent humor.\\" Meyer attended Harvard University, where he served as president of the Harvard Lampoon. The fact that people took humor \\"very seriously\\" at the Lampoon \\"changed [Meyer's] life\\". In 1977, he and several other Lampoon staffers wrote The Harvard Lampoon Big Book of College Life (), a volume commissioned by Doubleday. Aside from the Lampoon, his grades at Harvard were average and he suffered several bouts of depression. He graduated in 1978 with a degree in biochemistry and was accepted into medical school, but decided not to enroll. Meyer commented on his Roman Catholic upbringing in a 2000 New Yorker profile: > People talk about how horrible it is to be brought up Catholic, and it's all > true. The main thing was that there was no sense of proportion. I would chew > a piece of gum at school, and the nun would say, 'Jesus is very angry with > you about that,' and on the wall behind her would be a dying, bleeding guy > on a cross. That's a horrifying image to throw at a little kid. You really > could almost think that your talking in line, say, was on a par with killing > Jesus. Career After college, Meyer moved to Denver, Colorado, planning to \\"scientifically\\" win a fortune through dog racing. However, he ran out of money after two weeks. He then worked in a variety of jobs including as a substitute teacher, and a salesman in a clothing store, and also won $2,000 on the game show Jeopardy!. He at one point worked in a research lab as an assistant, studying glycoproteins \\"in the hope that they would prove the key to cell-cell recognition.\\" Meanwhile, fellow Lampoon writers Tom Gammill and Max Pross suggested Meyer to comedian David Letterman who, along with head writer Merrill Markoe, hired him as a member of the writing staff on Letterman's new late night show. Letterman noted: \\"Everything in his submission, down to the last little detail, was so beautifully honed.\\" Meyer wrote several recurring gags for the show, including \\"Crushing Things With A Steamroller\\". His ambitions for the show were grandiose; \\"I wanted to challenge the audience every night, stagger them with brilliance, blast them into a higher plane of existence,\\" he later explained. Meyer left to write for The New Show in late 1983, a short-lived variety series from Saturday Night Live creator Lorne Michaels. He shared an office with writer Jack Handey, whom he credited with giving him comedy advice. Following this, he joined the writing teams at Not Necessarily the News, and Saturday Night Live beginning in 1985. He later called working on SNL an \\"exhilarating, frustrating, stressful, and indelible experience.\\" Meyer's work was not well regarded among the SNL writers and producers. He said: \\"My stuff wasn't very popular at Saturday Night. It was regarded as really fringey, and a lot of times my sketches would get cut. Sometimes they would get cut after dress rehearsal, and I would have the horrible experience of looking out and seeing a painter carefully touching up my set and getting it all ready to be smashed to pieces and sent to a landfill in Brooklyn. It was just a mismatch, although I didn't realize it at the time.\\" He left the show in 1987. Meyer moved to Boulder, Colorado because he \\"just wanted to get as far from the New York environment as [he] could.\\" There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time \\"skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado.\\" He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he \\"tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh.\\" He claimed that \\"[he] didn't know what [he] was doing,\\" and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: \\"I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine.\\" Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stone's \\"Hot List\\" in 1989. Meyer noted: \\"The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of how Americans see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that.\\" Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: \\"In comedy circles, [Army Man has] taken on almost mythological proportions.\\" This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt \\"embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined.\\" Sam Simon hired Meyer for The Simpsons after being impressed by Army Man. One reader was Sam Simon, a producer of the animated sitcom The Simpsons. He sent Meyer a compilation reel of Simpsons shorts from Fox variety show The Tracey Ullman Show that preceded the development of the series. Meyer turned down the job initially, but was offered a second chance to work as a creative consultant in the fall of 1989, which he accepted. Simon hired Meyer along with Army Man contributors Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti. Meyer often played an active role in the show's extensive group script rewriting sessions in the \\"rewrite room\\", a role he performed more than solo script work; indeed he has only been credited for writing twelve episodes. A. O. Scott described him as the \\"guru\\" of the room. In the room, according to Mike Reiss, writers would \\"involuntarily glance at Meyer for approval when they pitch lines of their own\\". By 1995, Meyer became tired of the show's lengthy writing schedule and decided to leave after the sixth season to work on a film or TV pilot script. He soon returned, however, as a consultant and later as a part of the writing staff again and an executive producer. In 2004 he noted: \\"It's hard to leave The Simpsons. Every once in a while I get romantic notions that I should be doing something much more subterranean. Something like Army Man, or maybe guerrilla filmmaking.\\" He has attempted several TV projects that were not picked up. He left the show in 2006, and received his final credits in season 17. Meyer returned to co-write the 2007 film adaptation of the show, The Simpsons Movie, On the main page, click on \\"About the DVD\\" then on \\"Production Notes\\". which he later had mixed feelings about: \\"We worked so hard, and people liked it, but it still feels slapdash to me.\\" Meyer has been publicly credited with \\"thoroughly shap[ing] ... the comedic sensibility\\" of The Simpsons; in 2000, Mike Scully, the show runner for the series at the time, called him \\"the best comedy writer in Hollywood.\\" Scully said he was \\"the main reason\\" why The Simpsons [was] still so good after all these years.\\" Vitti has said Meyer's \\"fingerprints are on nearly every script\\" and he \\"exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without being one of the creators,\\" while recounting how \\"a show that you have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will come up to you and tell you how great it was. Then they'll mention their two favorite lines, and both of them will be George's.\\" Bill Oakley noted Meyer has \\"been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant. Meyer has a \\"deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general,\\" which has affected the writing of his own episodes of The Simpsons such as \\"Homer the Heretic\\", \\"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington\\" and \\"Bart vs. Thanksgiving\\". For his work on The Simpsons, Saturday Night Live and Late Night with David Letterman, Meyer has won and received multiple Primetime Emmy Award nominations, including the award for Outstanding Writing in a Variety Or Music Program in 1989. In addition to his work on The Simpsons, Meyer wrote, directed, and starred in his own play, Up Your Giggy, which ran for two weeks at a West Hollywood theater in 2002. In 2005, Meyer cowrote the TBS special Earth to America. Personal life Meyer is in a relationship with the writer Maria Semple. They lived together during the 1990s and broke up in 1999, but later got back together. Their child, named Poppy Valentina after Valentina Tereshkova, was born in 2003; being a father gave Meyer a \\"sense of hopefulness\\". They live in Seattle. Although raised a Catholic, Meyer hated it and later became agnostic. While working at The Simpsons he became an atheist, taking the advice of fellow writer Mike Reiss. He is a vegetarian, gambler, collector of space program memorabilia and practices yoga. Meyer is a fan of the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia being the \\"closest thing in Meyer's life to a spiritual figure.\\" His sister Ann is married to Jon Vitti. Meyer has a strong interest in the environment and notes that \\"the only organization that I really care about these days\\" is Conservation International. In 2005, a newly discovered species of moss frogs from Sri Lanka was named Philautus poppiae after Meyer's daughter Poppy, a tribute to Meyer's and Semple's dedication to the Global Amphibian Assessment. In 2006 he wrote a comic, cautionary opinion piece about the environment for BBC News. It begins: > Are you a hypocrite? Because I certainly am. I'm an animal lover who wears > leather shoes; a vegetarian who can't resist smoked salmon. I badger my > friends to see the Al Gore movie, but I also fly on fuel-gulping jets. Great > clouds of hypocrisy swirl around me. But even a fraud has feelings. And this > summer, I'm feeling uneasy; I'm starting to think that our culture's > frenzied and mindless assault on the last shreds of nature may not be the > wisest course.

A bomb went off at the church on September 15, 1963. -- (HABS photo) Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is a large interpretive museum and research center in Birmingham, Alabama that depicts the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and 1960s. The Institute is located in the Civil Rights District, which includes the historic 16th Street Baptist Church, Kelly Ingram Park, Fourth Avenue Business District, and the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame located in the Carver Theatre. The Institute opened in November 1992, and had more than 25,000 visitors during its first week. Exhibits The Institute showcases a walking journey through the \\"living institution\\", which displays the lessons of the past as a positive way to chart new directions for the future. The permanent exhibitions are a self-directed journey through Birmingham's contributions to the Civil Rights Movement and human rights struggles. Multimedia exhibitions focus on the history of African-American life and the struggle for civil rights. The Oral History Project, one of the museum's multimedia exhibits, documents Birmingham's role in the Civil Rights Movement through the voices of movement participants. The museum is an affiliate in the Smithsonian Affiliations program. Through this program the museum can acquire long-term loans and is currently hosting the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service exhibition \\"Let Your Motto Be resistance.\\" The archives of the Institute serve as a national resource for educators and researchers. They are a repository for the collection and preservation of civil rights documents and artifacts. The archival information system is computer-linked to the Birmingham Public Library and is a vital component of the Archives Division. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is also a community resource for meetings, seminars and workshops. A Community Meeting Room is available to local organizations. The museum is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.

The Lithuanian ANBO 41 was far ahead of the most modern foreign reconnaissance aircraft of that time in structural features, and most importantly in speed and in rise time. All ANBO 41 aircraft were likely destroyed during World War II. Development The ANBO IV was developed from the ANBO III trainer. The design was supervised by colonel Antanas Gustaitis. The first flight took place on July 14, 1932, and the prototype was powered by a Wasp engine. After successful trials, series production began. Thirteen series-built aircraft were powered by British Bristol Pegasus engines and were manufactured by Lithuanian Aircraft State Factory. It could be armed with two pairs of light machine guns and could carry 200 kg of bombs. Operational history ANBO IVs were introduced into Lithuanian Air Force in 1934 and shortly before that a few aircraft made demonstration flights in a few European countries: Soviet Union, France, United Kingdom and most Scandinavian countries. Between June 25 and July 29, 1934, three aircraft commanded by colonel Gustaitis flew 10,000 km route. ANBO IV and ANBO 41 aircraft equipped one and two reconnaissance squadrons respectively in Lithuanian Air Force, at the time of the Soviet Occupation of Baltic Republics in the summer of 1940.

The settlement at the head of the bay is at the southern end of a thin strip of land or causeway connecting Pepin Island with the South Island. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"red glow of sunset on the water\\" for . The bay itself is a wide, northwest-facing bay in the Tasman Bay. It lies just north of the Horoirangi Marine Reserve, between the tidal island Pepin Island and the mainland. It provides a natural boulder barrier from the sea for the Wakapuaka estuary. Looking down on the beach at Cable Bay, with Pepin Island beyond  History  There is evidence that MƒÅori used the area around Cable Bay from about 1150 for fishing and camping. There was also a pƒÅ on Pepin Island near the end of the causeway linking the island to the mainland. Both the pƒÅ and the bay itself were known as Rotokura. European settlers named the bay Schroders Mistake following an incident in April 1843. A cutter owned by Schroder, a Nelson merchant, was taking a survey party led by John Barnicoat to Marlborough, but it became stranded on the sand bar. The general locality is known as Wakapuaka. The name Cable Bay arose from New Zealand's first overseas cable link, to Australia, which was opened on 21 February 1876. The international telegraph cable established a connection with the worldwide telegraph network via Sydney. The cable came ashore into a timber building, continuing through a cedar-topped cable, a stone-cemented passage and underground to the cable house. From the cable station, messages were sent to Nelson via telegraph wire. This new service meant communications to Europe only took four days instead of up to six months for letters. With a population of about 30, the cable station was a self-contained village. The company's offices and sleeping quarters burned down in 1914. The cable station remained in operation until 1917, when the cable was shifted to Titahi Bay near Wellington due to the increasing economic importance of the North Island. The place name changed to Cable Bay in 1926.Information contained on an information panel at the Cable Bay camp ground In March 2001, Telecom installed a 200 km long submarine cable system between Cable Bay and Hokio Beach near Levin. The cable has 24 fibre-optic strands with no intermediate repeaters and provides a communications cable between the South Island and the North Island that is physically diverse from the existing Cook Strait communications cables. The terminal stations are located at Nelson and Levin.Information contained on an information panel up Sentinel Hill south of Cable Bay In August 2014 the name of the bay officially became Rotokura / Cable Bay, following the Treaty of Waitangi settlement between the Crown and NgƒÅti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu.  Recreation  Rotokura / Cable Bay The sheltered beach at Cable Bay has sandy patches but is mostly a shingle beach. The thin land connection to Pepin Island forming the crest of the beach is the result of a rare combination of strong currents and a rock source. The area is part of the Cable Bay Recreation Reserve, managed by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. It offers ample parking, toilets, and picnic tables, but no rubbish facilities. Overnight staying is not permitted on the reserve. The adjacent marine reserve offers recreational opportunities such as kayaking and snorkelling. There are also sea kayak trip ranging from half-day to day-trips around Pepin Island departing at Cable Bay. The three-hour Cable Bay Walkway leads over farmland south to Glenduan, offering coastal views of the Boulder Bank. The track is a tramping track and crosses private farmland. It is closed during lambing season in spring, and no dogs are allowed.

A rural hamlet today, St. Johns prospered as a commercial and industrial centre during the 19th century. History Benjamin Canby built a sawmill on nearby Twelve Mile Creek in 1792. The creek was noted for its consistent flow, even during dry summers. Several more mills were soon built in St. Johns, and the settlement flourished as the most important industrial centre on the Niagara Peninsula. Another early settler, John Darling, built a log cabin in 1799, which was used as a home until 1803. In 1804, the cabin was converted to a public school. Known as St. Johns Common School, it was the first non- denominational free school in Upper Canada, and remained in use until 1844, when a new school was built nearby. The cabin continues to be used for educational purposes, and is the oldest extant public school in Ontario. St. Johns prospered during the 1830s, when it had churches, a tannery, woolen factory, fulling mill, flour mill, potashery, iron foundry, brickyard, hat factory, and several grist and sawmills. A post office was established in 1831. In December 1837, following the failed Toronto Rebellion, rebel leader William Lyon Mackenzie escaped to the United States with the help of Samuel Chandler, a wagon maker from St. Johns. The following June, a group of rebels, including Chandler, travelled from Grand Island, New York, to St. Johns, where they participated in the Short Hills raid, attacking 10 Queen's Lancers stationed at John Osterhout's Tavern near St. Johns. The raid was successful, though most of the attackers were later captured and put on trial. Chandler was convicted of treason and sent to Van Diemen's Land. A monument to Chandler is located in St. Johns. Decline Mr. and Mrs. F. N. Pitts in front of their store in St. Johns, 1919 The opening of the nearby Welland Canal in 1829 led to rapid development of industry in St. Catharines, Thorold, and Welland, and encouraged people and commercial enterprises to re-locate from St. Johns to those settlements. The canal also drew water from headwaters of Twelve Mile Creek, thus reducing its flow through St. Johns. By 1850, the industries in St. Johns were in decline, and its population was reduced from 250 to 150 between 1851 and 1857. When the Great Western Railway and Welland Railway were completed through the region between 1853 and 1859, St. Johns was bypassed. By 1900, St. Johns contained only a blacksmith shop, a cooper shop, a post office, a church, two stores, and a school. The post office was later closed in 1914. In 1992, on the 200th anniversary of the settling of St. Johns, a granite marker was placed at the settlement. St. Johns Centre In 1958, the Union School in St. Johns closed and was converted to the St. Johns Outdoor Studies Centre (now called St. Johns Centre). The centre is operated by the Niagara Peninsula Conservation Authority, and serves 10,000 students per year. Outdoor programs are conducted at nearby St. Johns Conservation Area and Short Hills Provincial Park, and some classes are taught in the historic St. Johns Common School.

It had an instruction set that was optimized for manipulating audio data, which has typical sample rates of between 10 kHz and 50 kHz. The ESP was capable of creating a wide range of digital effects including reverb, delay, echo, flanging, chorusing, harmonizing, equalization, and distortion, and was capable of generating multiple effects simultaneously. The ESP was a VLSI device designed in a 1.0 micrometre double-metal CMOS process. The multiplicity and flexibility of the data paths in the ESP allowed many DSP operations to be accomplished in a minimum number of microinstructions steps. Its nominal instruction cycle was 250 ns, yielding program lengths from about 64 to 160 microinstructions at typical sample rates. Because the ESP chip was fully programmable, the range of effects was unlimited. The major features of the ESP chip were: *48 Pin DIP or 52 Pin PLCC *Separate Address Generator ALU *4 Programmable Serial I/O Channels (I¬≤S or Sony Format) *On-Chip Data and Microprogram Memory *8-Bit Address/Data Multiplexed Host CPU Interface *External Sample Rate Synchronization *Multiplexed Addressing for Simple DRAM Interface *Host Access to ESP DRAM The architecture of the ESP chip was implemented by the following major components: *ALU - 24-bit wide, capable of 16 different instructions *Multiplier - 24x24 bit with dedicated 48 bit accumulator *Separate Address Generator ALU *Microinstruction Memory Array (160 x 45 bits) *General Purpose Register Array (192 x 24 bits) *23 Special Purpose Registers *Three 24-bit wide data paths *Serial Digital I/O (4 stereo channels, I2S or Sony) *Host interface References * Sound cards ","title":"Ensoniq Signal Processor"},{"id":"3527516","text":"Moacir Bastos, usually known simply as Tuta (born 20 June 1974) is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a striker.

On January 24, 1999, he became well known after scoring a goal in the last minute in the 2-1 S.S.C. Venezia victory against Bari. Many Venezia players did not celebrate the goal or the victory, raising suspicions that the match was fixed to end in a draw. Tuta told the press that he had suspected a deal to end the match in a draw. However, on January 27, he denied his previous affirmation, justifying it as a misinterpretation by the press due to his limited capacity of speaking the Italian language.

Wild populations have been found in the United States in California and Utah, but were likely introduced anthropogenically and naturalized. Taxonomy and history  The history of the Ganoderma lucidum taxon is tied to the history of the erection of Ganoderma as a genus. Karsten first described the Ganoderma in 1881 and included only one species in the genus, G. lucidum (Curtis) Karst. Previously, it was called Boletus lucidus Curtis (1781) and then Polyporus lucidus (Curtis) Fr. (1821). Patouillard revised Karsten‚Äôs genus Ganoderma to include all species with pigmented spores, adhering tubes and laccate crusted pilei, which resulted in a total of 48 species classified under the genus Ganoderma in his 1889 monograph. Despite this recognition of additional species and subsequent discoveries of new Ganoderma species, such as 17 new North American species identified by Murrill North in 1902, the taxonomy of Ganoderma species has remained chaotic, and the species name Ganoderma lucidum continues to be used for most laccate Ganoderma species, including commonly misidentifying Ganoderma lingzhi (also known as reishi mushroom (Japan) or lingzhi/ling chih (China)), the sought-after red laccate Ganoderma species used in traditional Asian medicine. It is important to note that G. lucidum is not a synonym for G. lingzhi and is not in the same clade: based on molecular phylogenetic analyses, G. lucidum is more closely related to North American species Ganoderma tsugae and Ganoderma oregonense than to G. lingzhi, whose sister taxa include Ganoderma curtisii and Ganoderma ravenelii. These genetic analyses tested species concept hypotheses to determine how the laccate Ganoderma taxa are related. One such study found six major clades among the 29 samples studied. Samples labeled as G. lucidum were found in five of the six clades, showing the extent of the confusion around species identification. Another study found similar results, and also showed that Ganoderma resinaceum from Europe and the North American sample wrongly labeled G. lucidum were sister taxa and were also more closely related to each other than the European G. lucidum sensu stricto. A recent multilocus phylogeny, using ITS, tef, rpb1, and rpb2, revealed that the global diversity of the laccate Ganoderma species included three supported major lineages. These results agree with several of the earlier works focusing mostly on morphology, geography and host preference, but with statistical support separating the European and North American taxa. The phylogenetic species concept using a multilocus approach is currently the most robust and accepted method for designating species ranks for the fungi.  Ganoderma lucidum in the marketplace: Medicinal products and tissue culture samples  The confusion surrounding the taxonomy of Ganoderma species has nonetheless persisted, causing confusion and inaccuracies when labeling medicinal and manufactured products containing Ganoderma species, as well as \\"grow your own\\" (GYO) kits and other tissue samples sold for cultivation of Ganoderma species. Products typically carry a label of G. lucidum, very often along with the words \\"reishi\\" and \\"lingzhi/ling chih\\" (which most typically refer to Asian Ganoderma species used in traditional medicine, such as G. lingzhi and Ganoderma sinense) merely because they contain a laccate Ganoderma species. These products and GYO kits sold as Ganoderma lucidum very often do not contain G. lucidum sensu stricto: one study showed through DNA analysis that 93% of GYO kits and half of the dried mushroom products studied that were labeled \\"G. lucidum\\" contained G. lingzhi in actuality, a happy result for those wanting the Asian medicinal mushroom but inaccurate labeling nonetheless. The study also found that no manufactured reishi product and only one GYO kit actually contained G. lucidum sensu stricto. Other species present in these products included Ganoderma applanatum, Ganoderma australe (potentially a species complex), Ganoderma gibbosum, Ganoderma sessile, and G. sinense.  Description of Ganoderma lucidum sensu stricto  Ganoderma lucidum sensu stricto has a limited distribution in Europe and parts of China, where it grows on the decaying hardwood trees. It almost always has a stipe present, which is tawny to russet colored and 1.5 times the diameter of the cap. Context tissue (sterile tissue inside the fruiting body between the pileus crust and the initiation of the tubes) is pink-buff to cinnamon-buff and corky, showing concentric growth zones and no resinous or melanoid deposits. The hymenium displays 4-5 pores per millimetre. Chlamydospores are absent. Basidiospores are 8.2-12.1Œºm (average 10.7) long, 4.8-8.9Œºm (average 7.1) wide, a spore shape index (SSI) of 66.2 and a Q ratio of 1.5.

Stanly (January 10, 1810 ‚Äì July 12, 1872) was a North Carolina politician and orator who represented the southeastern portion of the state in the United States House of Representatives for five terms. In 1857, Stanly ran for Governor of California, but lost to John B. Weller. Politicians of the mid-nineteenth century remarked that Stanly bore a strong physical resemblance to William H. Seward, though this resemblance lessened over time. Biography Stanly was born in New Bern, North Carolina, on January 10, 1810. He was a son of U.S. Rep. John Stanly of New Bern and a cousin of U.S. Senator George Edmund Badger. Stanly attended New Bern Academy and graduated from the American Literary, Scientific and Military Academy, Norwich University in 1829. He then studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1832. He settled in Beaufort County and began to practice law. Four years later, he successfully ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives on the Whig ticket. He served in the Twenty-fifth, Twenty-sixth and Twenty- seventh congresses from March 4, 1837 to March 3, 1843. Stanly earned his reputation as North Carolina's greatest orator of his generation during his first term in Congress. Throughout his service in Congress, Stanly was a leader of the Southerners who emphasized the Union over states' rights. He won the nickname the 'Conqueror' during his re-election campaign of 1839. After an unsuccessful bid for re-election in 1843 due to unfavorable redistricting, Stanly returned to North Carolina, where he served as a member of the House of Commons from 1844 to 1846 and again in 1848. He was speaker of the State House from 1844 to 1846, and his impartial presiding was hailed by Commoners of both parties as returning dignity to the chamber in the place of the former political rancor. Stanly served briefly as attorney general of North Carolina in 1847-1848. In 1849, Stanly was again elected to the U.S. House, serving two terms from March 4, 1849 to March 3, 1853. He declined to run for a sixth term in the elections of 1853 and instead moved to California and practiced law in San Francisco. He was the Republican Party‚Äôs unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1857. Abraham Lincoln appointed Stanly military governor of eastern North Carolina with the rank of brigadier general on May 26, 1862. Stanly resigned this office less than a year later on March 2, 1863, in a dispute with President Lincoln over the Emancipation Proclamation. He returned to California and resumed his law practice. He died in San Francisco on July 12, 1872. He is buried in the Stanly family plot at Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland, California. Personal life On May 11, 1859, in San Francisco, Stanly married Cornelia Baldwin, the sister of Joseph G. Baldwin, a Virginia- born attorney who served on the California Supreme Court. She died April 13, 1903, in San Francisco. Stanly had a very colorful nephew who fought on the Confederate side during the Civil War, Brigadier General Lewis Armistead. Armistead led the Confederate Army at Pickett‚Äôs Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg. Stanly and Armistead were born in the same house in New Bern, North Carolina. The home stands today.

Whitney was involved in nationwide legal battles to regulate tobacco advertising, on behalf of the public health community, including the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and Public Citizen. Whitney also is one of the founding members of the Illinois Green Party and wrote a significant portion of the Party's platform. 2002 and 2004 Campaigns for State House of Representatives In both 2002 and 2004, Whitney ran for the Illinois House of Representatives for the 115th District (Carbondale) seat. In 2002 Whitney finished 3rd of 3 running for one seat gaining 2,150 votes for 6% of the total vote. In Whitney's second attempt for elected office he managed 3,859 votes for 8.3% of the total vote. 2006 run for Governor On June 26, 2006, the Illinois Green Party filed a nominating petition including signatures of more than 39,000 Illinois voters, collected within a 90-day period. New political parties are required to collect 25,000 signatures within this period to get onto the ballot in Illinois, while established parties need only 5,000 according to state law. The petition measured approximately 19 inches thick. According to the Illinois State Board of Elections, within 2 hours of filing, a copy of the petition was requested by Mike Kasper, General Counsel and Treasurer of the Democratic Party of Illinois, at 6:00pm. One week later, on July 3, objections to the petition were filed, claiming that many of the signatures were not genuine or did not belong to registered voters. Green Party officials stated that the objections seemed to have been made at random, without actual examination of any records. The objections included signatures that the Greens had already crossed out; and in some cases objections were made to the 11th signature on a page, even though each page contained only 10 signatures. Even Whitney's own signature on the petition was challenged. The hearing process involved 12 or more election judges consistently working full- time for several weeks. Each party also provided a matching number of members to sit with the election judges, during the workday, as they examined thousands of signatures, either overruling or sustaining each objection. Objections were assumed valid, and automatically sustained, unless a Green Party representative was present before each election judge to compare signatures and present a defense. Following the hearing, the State Board of Elections' Hearing Officer, Barbara Goodman, recommended that the Green Party's candidates be placed on the ballot and stated that the case was \\"extremely straightforward.\\" The Board's examination confirmed that the Greens collected thousands more than the required number of signatures for ballot access. On Election Day, Whitney ran third, receiving, 361,336 votes for 10.4%. Incumbent Governor Rod Blagojevich won the election, receiving 1,736,731 votes, for 49.8%. State Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka ran second, with 1,369,315 votes for 39.3%. By receiving more than 5% of the total vote, Whitney's candidacy allowed the Green Party to become an established political party statewide, according to Illinois state election law. This status provided the party with several new advantages, such as lower signature requirements for ballot access, primary elections, free access to additional voter data, the ability to elect precinct committeemen, run a partial slate of candidates at any jurisdictional level, and slate candidates without petitioning. The only other statewide established political parties are the Democratic and Republican parties. It is rare for a new political party to become established statewide in Illinois, the last to do so being the Solidarity Party in 1986 and the Progressive Party before that. 2010 run for Governor On July 15, 2009, Whitney announced his candidacy for the Green Party's nomination for governor in 2010.Blackwell, Thomas. The Southern Illinoisan, July 16, 2010 Whitney's campaign platform included raising income taxes, lowering property taxes, legalizing and taxing marijuana, and putting a tax on some of the trades at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange. Whitney said even a tiny tax on the billions of dollars traded on the Exchange could amount to big money for the state. In a March 2010 interview, Whitney stated, \\"I think most people in Illinois are actually in favor of an income tax increase.\\"Riopell, Mike. The Pantagraph, Thursday March 11, 2010 Like California Green Party gubernatorial candidate Laura Wells, Whitney also proposed putting state tax revenues and pension contributions into a state bank. In a March 11, 2010, article in The Nation, Whitney said, \\"Instead of using state funds as a means to further enrich private banks, a state-owned bank could earn additional revenue for the state while at the same time help spur economic development in Illinois.\\"Nichols, John. The Nation, Thursday March 11, 2010 According to a poll conducted from June 12‚Äì13, Whitney was at 9%, Public Policy Polling, June 15, 2010 and by August a poll showed that 11% of respondents approved of him. But a poll in September showed a decline to 8%, and by late October his numbers were as low as 4%. FOX News, October 23, 2010 (Poll results are summarized in the article Illinois gubernatorial election, 2010.) Whitney called for open debates to include all candidates, and stated in an interview: > \\"The idea of debate is to get all of the points of view on the table, and > let the voters decide,\\" Whitney said. \\"I'm very happy to put my ideas to the > test of more than just two opponents. Again, I think the public is the > winner when that happens.\\"Crow, Rob. The Southern, Wednesday, June 23, 2010 In October 2010, CBS News reported that Whitney's name was misspelled on electronic ballots as \\"Rich Whitey\\". The problem affected 20 Chicago wards that were predominantly African-American. It was estimated that 10% of all votes would be cast electronically. Results in the 2010 election showed that Whitney finished with 99,625 votes (2.7% of the total), placing fourth: ahead of Libertarian Lex Green but behind Scott Lee Cohen, who ran as an Independent.

Plot summary Griffin, an accomplished inline skater, works as a delivery boy in near-future Los Angeles. The city is overrun with crime and drug use, in the wake of \\"The Great Crash\\": an economic catastrophe triggered by the greed of previous generations. The film includes ominous events, including: news reports of riots in Washington D.C. (due to the Armed Forces going on strike); a television ad announcing that Harvard University was moved to Japan, followed by a question from one of the characters if \\"there will be any Universities left in America\\"; a newspaper headline that proclaims \\"GERMANY BUYS POLAND\\"; and references to the Vatican hiring the Israeli Defense Forces to \\"clean up\\" Northern Ireland. A heavily-armed white supremacist conglomerate known as the Rollerboys fight for control of the decaying city. Their director is charismatic narcotics-kingpin Gary Lee: a childhood neighbor of Griffin's, who's also rumored to be the great-grandson of Adolf Hitler. The Rollerboys carry out their mission of restoring Anglo-America's former greatness, through violent battles with other gangs...and through the distribution of \\"Heaven Mist\\", a designer drug. Griffin's younger brother Miltie, who idolizes the Rollerboys, takes a job with them pushing mist on the streets; eventually, Miltie starts using it himself. Then Casey, an undercover cop, recruits Griffin to join the Rollerboys as a mole...in exchange for a better life. Griffin is initiated but his loyalty to the Rollerboys is soon called into question. In order to prove himself, he unknowingly pummels Speedbagger, his and Miltie's Afro-American landlord, nearly to death. Shortly thereafter, Griffin discovers the chilling truth behind the Rollerboys' mantra \\"The Day of the Rope is coming\\". Rope turns out to be a toxic mist-additive, developed by the Rollerboys, which gradually renders its users sterile; the purpose of this is to \\"eliminate the weak\\", removing future generations of the \\"junkie\\" population, thus giving the Rollerboys free rein over their concepts of a thriving American society.

On September 6, 2007, the company did a 1:1000 reverse split of its stock and changed its ticker symbol from \\"GZFX\\" to \\"GMZN.\\"Company information The company's home page went dark in November 2008. GameZnFlix operated in much the same fashion as other DVD-by-mail subscription services such as Netflix, although it rented both movies and video games and thus also competed with game-only services such as GameFly. Subscribers could also buy selected DVDs or games at a reduced price, should they choose to keep the movie or game. GameZnFlix also acted as a traditional online retailer and offered new copies of DVDs and video games for sale. Circuit City (now defunct) offered one month prepaid subscriptions of GameZnFlix for new customers, and gift certificates that could be sent to friends and family. Rental offerings and memberships  GameZnFlix offered online rental of video games for the PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii and movies in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc formats. They did not offer cartridge-based gaming formats such as those used for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. GameZnFlix offered three monthly subscription plans, which allowed the customer 1, 2, or 3 video games or movies at a time. All plans were of the unlimited variety. 14-day free trials of most of the plans were available with a restricted selection of titles. Members of the U.S. military received discounted pricing (roughly 10% off) on these plans, and GameZnFlix shipped to foreign military bases through the APO/FPO military mail service.  Financials  According to the last available SEC filings, GameZnFlix discontinued operations in the video rental business in November 2008. The filing states that the company will look for other business ventures to be acquired. The company had net losses of $1.1 million on revenue of $931,000 in 2008 versus losses of over $10 million on revenue of $3.6 million in 2007.  Distribution centers  According to the GameZnFlix 2007 Annual Report, the company used warehouses in Colorado and Kentucky to service its customers.  Marketing  From February 2004 through the 2005 Super Bowl GameZnFlix maintained a television advertisement campaign, some of which featured the actor Ben Curtis (best known as \\"The Dell Dude\\" in advertisements for Dell, Inc.). A pilot marketing program with electronics retailer Circuit City from November 2005 to March 2006 was extended to a full co-marketing agreement with all US stores offering prepaid subscriptions and other promotional efforts by Circuit City (flyers, online, etc.). All stores were participating as of December 2006. Throughout 2006, GameZnFlix sponsored of a bicycle racing team in and around Tennessee and several watercraft competitions throughout the United States. They increased Internet advertising with Internet service providers and started an affiliate program. They also teamed up with McDonald's and ClickCaster in a cross-country series of promotional events featuring tour buses, Ridge Racer 6 gaming competitions, outdoor movie showings, and other activities. Other tie-ins included Circuit City stores, ClickCaster broadcasts from on-site locations, and contributions to the Ronald McDonald House and other local charities.  Legal proceedings  From the GameznFlix 2008 Annual Report ‚Äì Item 3. Legal Proceedings: :On February 8, 2008, an action was filed in the United States District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania, entitled Mobile Satellite Communications v. GameZnFlix, Inc. et al.

A judgment in the amount of $350,000 has been rendered to the Plaintiff. :On February 28, 2008, an action was filed in the Simpson Circuit Court, Franklin, Kentucky, entitled CNET Networks, Inc v. GameZnFlix, Inc., D/B/A GameZnFlix.com. In this action, the plaintiff claims that it was damaged as a result of not being paid for online advertising requested by GameZnFlix, Inc. in the amount of $96,000. A judgment in the amount of $67,038 has been rendered to the Plaintiff. :On July 17, 2008, an action was filed in Simpson Circuit Court, Franklin, Kentucky, entitled Ingram Entertainment, Inc. v.

A judgement in the amount of $45,940 plus interest until settled was rendered on November 24, 2008.  Name change  Eight months after shutting down its DVD and game rental website (without notice to customers), GameznFlix announced that it has changed its corporate name to TBC Global News Network, Inc. and their stock trading symbol to TGLN. The change is to reflect a change in its business model from Online Video Rental to become a media organization concentrating on news and information about the second and third tier of American business. GameznFlix CEO John Fleming states \\"Between CNBC, Fox Business Network and Bloomberg, the market is pretty well saturated with information about Fortune 500 companies. We intend to focus on the companies you rarely hear about, those trading on the NASDAQ Small Cap, OTCBB, Pink Sheets and some interesting privately held firms that aren't publicly traded at all.\\" In October 2015, the company changed its name once again to InCapta Inc (stock symbol INCT).

An Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative , he played his entire NRL career for the Sea Eagles, with whom he won the 2008 and 2011 Premierships. Background Stewart was born and raised in Wollongong, New South Wales, Australia. Playing career Brett and his older brother Glenn Stewart played their junior football for the Western Suburbs Red Devils, the same Illawarra Rugby League club that produced Manly-Warringah legend and rugby league Immortal Bob Fulton. =2000s= Brett Stewart made his NRL debut for Manly on 6 July 2003 in round 17 of the 2003 NRL season as a replacement for injured fullback Brendon Reeves. In his only first grade game of the season, Manly were defeated 24-16 by the Parramatta Eels at Brookvale Oval. After playing from the bench in a 30‚Äì22 loss to the Wests Tigers at Leichhardt Oval in Round 7 of the 2004 NRL season, rookie coach and dual Manly premiership player Des Hasler moved former dual international Andrew Walker from fullback to to bring Stewart in as the Sea Eagles fullback in Round 9 against the St. George Illawarra Dragons at Brookvale Oval. Stewart was second on the top try scorer list with 21 tries for the 2006 NRL season, one behind the South Sydney Rabbitohs' winger Nathan Merritt. In his first representative match playing for the Prime Minister's XIII against Papua New Guinea, he contributed to Australia's 28‚Äì8 win with a try. He made his State of Origin debut in Game 2 of the 2007 series, replacing injured Anthony Minichiello at late notice, and scored a try. Stewart played in the 2007 NRL Grand Final for Manly against the Melbourne Storm, and was knocked out while contesting a bomb with Storm forward Michael Crocker in the early minutes of the 2nd half. Stewart was selected as fullback for Australia's end of season test against New Zealand in Wellington, and contributed with a try in Australia's record 58‚Äì0 victory over the Kiwis. Stewart playing for the Sea Eagles in 2008 After being overlooked for the Centenary Test against the Kiwis at the Sydney Cricket Ground in favour of Storm and Queensland fullback Billy Slater, and again representing NSW in the 2008 State of Origin series, Stewart was one of the form players for Manly in their run to the 2008 NRL Grand Final, and was the NRL's leading try scorer of the season with 22 tries from 24 appearances. In the Grand Final, Manly faced Melbourne for the second year running. 2008 would be very different to the previous season, however, as the Sea Eagles recorded the largest ever GF win of 40‚Äì0. While Stewart did not cross for a try in the GF, he provided the last pass on a couple of occasions for teammates to score, including the last try of the game for departing , Steven Bell. In August 2008, Stewart was named in the preliminary 46-man Kangaroos squad for the 2008 Rugby League World Cup, and in October 2008 he was selected in the final 24-man Australia squad alongside other Manly players Brent Kite, Josh Perry, Anthony Watmough, David Williams, and his brother Glenn. Unfortunately however, Stewart was forced to withdraw with a shoulder injury before the competition had begun. Stewart travelled with Manly-Warringah to England to face the Super League champions Leeds for the 2009 World Club Challenge at the Elland Road stadium in Leeds. Manly showed their class with a 28‚Äì20 win over Leeds, with both Stewart and Anthony Watmough crossing for two tries. In the lead-up to the WCC, Manly became the first Australian side travelling to England to actually play a warm-up game, defeating the Harlequins RL at The Stoop in London, winning 34‚Äì26. Stewart featured in the NRL's 2009 television advertising campaign, alongside Storm player Greg Inglis as the \\"faces of rugby league\\". The campaign was launched in The Domain with Stewart declaring the start of the 101st season of rugby league in Australia. Legal issues then saw Stewart suspended from the opening four rounds of the 2009 NRL season. Without Stewart at fullback, Manly opened their premiership defence with four straight losses. The rot stopped when Stewart returned in Round 5 against the Wests Tigers at Brookvale, scoring 3 tries as Manly won 23‚Äì10. He scored another two at Brookvale the next week against South Sydney before a knee injury forced him to miss the next 19 games. He made his return in Round 25 against Cronulla. In 2011, Stewart won his second premiership as Manly defeated New Zealand 24‚Äì10 in the 2011 NRL Grand Final with Stewart scoring a try in the match. In 2013, Manly made the grand final again and Stewart played at fullback in their 26‚Äì18 defeat by the Sydney Roosters.https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/manly-sea-eagles- celebrate-their-2011-nrl-grand-final-win-at-beachside-apartments/news- story/a2c120022994d90b1dd706491b26af99http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-06/nrl- grand-final-20133a-live-blog/5001498 Recurring injuries forced Stewart to retire in the pre-season of 2017, finishing his career as the 6th highest try scorer in NRL history and sea eagles legend. =Suspensions= Stewart was charged with sexual assault on 10 March 2009. The NRL said it was \\"making no judgement\\" and announced it would suspend the 2009 commercial which featured Stewart until further information became available. Despite the Manly board's decision to select Stewart for round one of the 2009 season, the NRL on 11 March suspended Stewart for the first four rounds for drunkenness, reportedly stating that \\"its decision to stop Stewart playing was not intended to reflect any judgment regarding the police investigation into the alleged assault.\\" = Career highlights = *Junior Club: Wests (Wollongong) *First Grade Debut: Manly v Parramatta Eels at Parramatta Stadium, 6 July 2003 (Rd 17) (Parra 27 d Manly 16) *State of Origin Debut:NSW vs Queensland at Telstra Stadium, 13 June 2007 (Qld 10 d NSW 6 ‚Äì 1 try) *Test Debut: Australia vs New Zealand at Westpac Stadium (Wellington, NZ), 21 October 2007 (Aus 58 d NZ 0 ‚Äì 1 try).

Following his injury forced retirement from playing in 2016 (though he was still a contracted Manly player in 2017), Stewart divides his time between his home in Sydney and the Toko Japanese restaurant (of which he is a 1/3 part owner) in Melbourne.Brett Stewart may never play in the NRL again Legal Investigation He was accused of assaulting a 17-year-old girl following the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles' season launch on 6 March 2009. Stewart denied the allegation and was granted bail to appear in Manly Local Court on 7 April. Stewart was charged with sexual assault on 10 March 2009. On 7 April 2009, Stewart entered a plea of not guilty to the charges at Manly Local Court and the matter was adjourned until 26 May, on which date Stewart's case was again mentioned in court, although Stewart was not present. The case was further adjourned to 23 June as his lawyer stated that he was still waiting on documents. When the court reconvened on 23 June 2009, his lawyers requested access to further documents, including psychiatric evaluations, and the matter was adjourned until September. The court met once again on 28 September, and there they found that Stewart had a case to answer. As a result, he was ordered to attend a committal hearing in February 2010. The committal hearing commenced on 4 February 2010, at Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court. Stewart was represented by Clive Steirn, with Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran presiding. He was accompanied by a number of supporters, including his ex-girlfriend Jamie Baker, family members, and Manly coach Des Hasler. His charges are sexual intercourse without consent, involving digital penetration, and assault with an act of indecency. Stewart continued to strongly deny the allegations, with the hearing temporarily adjourned for one hour while Cloran read evidential documentation. The tendered documentation included medical evidence, psychiatric reports, and statements from the alleged victim and her family. The alleged victim's former psychiatrist gave evidence for the hearing, these details were suppressed by Cloran. The hearing was adjourned until 22 March 2010, in order for the alleged victim's father to give evidence, as he was overseas. =Acquittal= On 22 March 2010, Deputy Chief Magistrate Paul Cloran determined that there was enough evidence for the case to proceed to trial. His trial commenced on Monday 13 September 2010 and concluded on 29 September 2010 with a jury who deliberated for 50 minutes to return a verdict of not guilty. At the opening and closing of his trial, jurors were told by the judge that Stewart deserves the presumption of innocence despite the high number of sexual assault cases involving high-profile players that have received media attention in Australia in recent years.http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/15/3012352.htm?section=justin On June 16 2012, The Sydney Morning Herald and Age newspapers published a lengthy investigation by journalist Mark Whittaker asserting that the father of the alleged victim had a long history of fraud. The \\"victim's\\" sister was quoted saying, \\"I'm not a footy fan but I felt for Brett Stewart because I felt, 'My father's tearing another innocent person's life apart.' He sees money signs around Brett. A perfect target ... My father just screws everyone's life that walks past him. It's terrible.\\"  References   External links  *NRL Profile *Brett Stewart Official Profile *Brief Analysis of Culture of Criminal Sexuality by NRL Players (Sydney Anglican) 1985 births Australian rugby league players Australia national rugby league team players Manly Warringah Sea Eagles players Manly Warringah Sea Eagles captains Country New South Wales Origin rugby league team players New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Prime Minister's XIII players Rugby league fullbacks People acquitted of sex crimes Sportspeople from Wollongong Living people ","title":"Brett Stewart (rugby league)"},{"id":"3527668","text":"SSPC may refer to: * Samar State Polytechnic College, predecessor of the Samar State University in the Philippines * Scottish School of Primary Care, an academic institution * Slope Stability Probability Classification, a classification system for slope engineering * Society for Protective Coatings, a professional organization for the industrial coatings industry * Solid State Pharmaceutical Cluster, ‚ÄúResearch Cluster‚Äù * Southern Sudan Peace Commission, a government organization in South Sudan * Statewide Suicide Prevention Council, an advisory body in Alaska ","title":"SSPC"},{"id":"3527677","text":"William Julian Albert (August 4, 1816 ‚Äì March 29, 1879) was a U.S. Congressman from the fifth district of Maryland, serving from 1873 to 1875.

He is considered one of the founders and principal representatives of ego psychology. Life Hartmann was born to a Jewish familyAbraham Ascher, A Community Under Siege: The Jews of Breslau Under Nazism, Stanford University Press (2007), p. 40 known for producing writers and academics. His own father was a professor of history, and his mother was a pianist and sculptor. After completing secondary school he entered the University of Vienna, where he received his medical degree in 1920. His interest was in Freudian theories. The death of Karl Abraham prevented Hartmann from following the training analysis he had envisioned with him, and instead he undertook a first analysis with S√°ndor Rad√≥. In 1927 he published Grundlagen der Psychoanalyse (The Fundamentals of Psychoanalysis) foreshadowing the theoretical contributions to ego psychology he would later make.Peter Gay, Freud: A Life for Our Time (London 1988) p. 540. He also participated in the creation of a manual of medical psychology. Sigmund Freud offered him free analysis if he stayed in Vienna just as he was offered a position at the Johns Hopkins Institute. He chose to enter into analysis with Freud and was noted as a shining star amongst analysts of his generation, and a favourite pupil of Freud's.Ernest Jones, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (Penguin 1964) p. 651. In 1937, at the Viennese Psychological Society, he presented a study on the psychology of ego, a topic on which he would later expand on and which became the foundation for the theoretical movement known as ego-psychology. In 1938 he left Austria with his family to escape the Nazis. Passing through Paris and then Switzerland, he arrived in New York in 1941 where he quickly became one of the foremost thinkers of the New York Psychoanalytic Society. He was joined by Ernst Kris and Rudolph Loewenstein, with whom he wrote many articles in what was known as the ego-psychology triumvirate.Janet Malcolm, Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession (London 1988) p. 4. In 1945 he founded an annual publication The Psychoanalytic Study of the Child with Kris and Anna Freud; while in the 1950s he became the president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA) and after several years of his presidency, he received the honorary title of lifetime president. Writings and influence 1922 saw the publication of Hartmann's first article, on depersonalization,Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 623 which was followed by a number of studies on psychoses, neuroses, twins, etc. In 1939, Hartmann, in what Otto Fenichel called \\"a very interesting paper, tried to show that adaptation has been studied too much from the point of view of mental conflict. He points out that there is also a 'sphere without conflict' \\"Otto Fenichel, The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis (London 1946) p. 52. ‚Äì something that would be repeatedly emphasized in ego-psychology. In the same year, in \\"Psychoanalysis and the Concept of Health\\", he made an impressive contribution to defining normality and health in psychoanalytic terms.Fenichel, p. 581. The subsequent development of ego- psychology within psychoanalysis, with its shift from instinct theory to the adaptive functions of the ego has been seen as allowing psychoanalysis and psychology to move closer to each other.Richard Gregory, ed., The Oxford Companion to the Mind (Oxford 1987) p. 211. Ego-psychology became in fact the dominant psychoanalytic force in the States for the next half-century or so, before object relations theory began to come to the fore.Gregory ed., p. 270‚Äì271. It formed the basis and starting-point for the self psychology of Heinz Kohut, for example, which both opposed and was rooted in Hartmann's theory of libido.Neville Symington, Narcissism: A New Theory (London 1993) p. 107. =Criticism= Jacques Lacan focused much of his ire on what he called \\"'ego psychology' √† la Hartmann...as a repudiation of psychoanalysis\\"Jacques Lacan, Ecrits: A Selection (London 1997) p. 238 and p. 127. ‚Äì taking issue with its stress on the conflict-free zone of the ego and on adaptation to reality.David Macey, \\"Introduction\\", Jacques Lacan, The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis (Penguin 1994) p. xxi.

In 2019, most of its functions were absorbed by a new Department of Communities and Justice. The Department was responsible for the State's justice system ‚Äì courts, prosecutions, prisons, sheriffs ‚Äì and most emergency service agencies. The Department was known as the Department of Justice and Attorney General (2009‚Äì11), the Department of Attorney General and Justice (2011‚Äì4), the Department of Police and Justice (2014) and finally the Department of Justice (2014‚Äì9). History The re-organisation of the legal system of Colonial New South Wales led to the creation of the Attorney- General, an appointed law officer. Following the creation of self-government in 1856, the position of Attorney-General became an officer appointed by the Government of the day from within the membership of the Parliament of New South Wales. In 1901, the Department of Attorney General and the Department of Justice were amalgamated into the Department of the Attorney General and Justice. In 1911, two separate branches of the Department were established, later called divisions which continued until the 1970s. Responsibility for police and corrective services were removed from the Department in the 1970s; and by 1991 the Department of Courts Administration was split out of the Department. Some four years later, the two Departments were merged to reform the Attorney General's Department. The Justice portfolio was re-established in 2009 through the creation of a new Department of Justice and Attorney General, abolishing the old Attorney General's Department. The headquarters of the department was at the Goodsell Building in Chifley Square. In 2008 the department's main business centres were relocated to newer offices in Parramatta. Following the 2011 state election the department was merged with Corrective Services and renamed to its current name. On 23 April 2014 it was decided that the department would be renamed the Department of Police and Justice. Subsequent government initiatives lead to the department becoming the Department of Justice. Following the 2019 state election the department merged with the Department of Family and Community Services and most of the functions of both departments were transferred to the newly formed Department of Communities and Justice.

Moon, Roy Wilkins, and Thurgood Marshall Herbert Hill (January 24, 1924 - August 15, 2004) was the labor director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for decades and was a frequent contributor to New Politics as well as the author of several books. He was later Evjue-Bascom Professor of Afro-American Studies and Industrial Relations at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and eventually emeritus professor. He played a significant role in the civil rights movement in pressuring labor unions to desegregate and to seriously implement measures that would integrate African Americans in the labor market. He was also famous for his belief that American trade unions had downplayed the history of racism that tarred their reputations, before and after the Jim Crow era. Early years Herbert Hill was born into a Jewish family on January 24, 1924, in Brooklyn, New York. He was educated in the public school system. Hill earned a B.A. from New York University in 1945 and attended the New School for Social Research from 1946 until 1948 where he studied under the distinguished political theorist, Hannah Arendt. [ http://biography.yourdictionary.com/herbert-hill biography.yourdictionary.com] Activism During the 1940s, Hill was a member of the Socialist Workers Party. Hill (although white) was appointed Labor Director of the NAACP in 1951 where he worked until 1977 when he departed for a professorship at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He was highly critical of the practice of nepotism in many unions whereby relatives of members were hired. Hill criticized labour relations practices in numerous industries including the film industry as well as the progress of the Kennedy Administration on issues of racial equality in the workplace. Among the many unions he criticized for their record on racial equality were the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, the United Auto Workers, the United Federation of Teachers and the United Steelworkers of America as well as the AFL-CIO federation itself. Hill particularly objected to the AFL-CIO position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 should not interfere with existing seniority systems. He was also a strong supporter of affirmative action. According to a New Politics article by Stephen Steinberg, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once described Hill as \\"the best barbershop lawyer in the United States\\". He also organized pickets to raise awareness of racial discrimination in the construction industry. His conduct was so controversial that some unions threatened to withhold funding of the NAACP unless Hill was fired, but the NAACP leadership under Roy Wilkins supported Hill. Hill published over one hundred articles in journals, anthologies and newspapers and was also known for polemics against labor historian Herbert Gutman as well as debates in New Politics (magazine) with union leader Al Shanker and Nelson Lichtenstein, an academic and biographer of Walter Reuther. Hill was especially sharp against Lichtenstein's support for the allegedly racist Reuther and the UAW's activities to betray the civil rights movement. He also served as a consultant for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the United Nations. =ILGWU Campaign= One of the most important campaigns led by Hill was his campaign against the discriminatory practices of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU). Despite the fact that the ILGWU had cooperated with the NAACP with respect to desegregation of union locals in the South, as late as the early 1960s, there were still no African-American nor Puerto Rican officers or executive board members in the ILGWU in its New York City base. The ILGWU was of particular importance because of its major role in the Liberal Party of New York. Hill played a key role in taking on a complaint against Local 10 of the ILGWU of an African American cutter, Ernest Holmes, who had been repeatedly prevented from joining the cutters' union, thereby receiving lower wages and denied the health and welfare benefits associated with union membership. Hill alleged that the ILGWU restricted African American and Puerto Rican workers to low paying jobs. In 1962, the New York State Commission for Human Rights found that Local 10 had violated the state antidiscrimination law. The ILGWU launched a public relations campaign alleging partisanship on the part of the Republican appointed Commission in response and did little to solve the problem. Writing in New Politics, a leading ILGWU official, Gus Taylor, attempted to show that there were African Americans and Puerto Ricans in the union. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. held Congressional hearings in the House Committee on Education and Labor on the ILGWU practices in 1962. Hill testified at the hearings, criticizing David Dubinsky for his governance of the ILGWU. Even though Hill was Jewish, allegations of anti-semitism were made with respect to the NAACP critique of the ILGWU. Changes to the ILGWU only came about slowly, especially after the retirement of Dubinsky in 1966. Alleged FBI informant Research published in Labor History by historian Christopher Phelps holds that Hill was an informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation on socialists he knew in the 1940s. Documents between high-level FBI officials referred to a male subject with a short redacted surname in New York who was an \\"SWP member during the period 1943-1949,\\" the period in which Hill belonged to the Socialist Workers Party, and who in 1962 was \\"currently employed by the NAACP as a labor relations official,\\" when there was no other labor official at the NAACP. The FBI documents state that the subject was \\"contacted on several occasions by New York Agents and has been cooperative\\" and furnished \\"information on individuals that were in the SWP during the time he was a member.\\"\\"1960s US civil rights official revealed as FBI informer,\\" University of Nottingham, Media Relations Other prominent NAACP officials, Phelps states, including Thurgood Marshall, Walter White, and Roy Wilkins are known to have cooperated with the FBI in its actions against the Civil Rights Congress and Communist Party. However, the allegations against Hill have been seriously disputed by many academics. Death Hill died on August 21, 2004 after a long illness. His death was announced by the University of Wisconsin. It was at the University of Wisconsin where Hill was an emeritus professor of Afro-American studies. Hill was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Lydon, in 2001.

Arlington was used by Union troops while planning the burning of the University of Alabama. The property went through several owners and in 1902 became the home of Robert S. Munger. Over the next twenty years he did many renovations including plumbing and electric lights. He had another structure moved across the street behind the main house which was used for a kitchen, dining room, sun parlor and sleeping quarters.

In this episode, a vision from Cordelia leads Angel to Bethany, a runaway teen who possesses barely controlled telekinetic powers. Unbeknownst to Angel, Lilah has brought Bethany to Los Angeles, hoping to groom her into being an assassin for Wolfram & Hart. Lilah attempts to provoke violent episodes in Bethany in order for Wolfram and Hart to gain control of the teen. First she has her cornered in an alley by potential rapists hired by Wolfram and Hart, and then she has her sexually abusive father appear and try to take Bethany back home. Meanwhile, Darla continues to plague Angel's dreams and Angel finds himself sleeping longer and longer hours. Plot Lilah sneaks into Lindsey's office to rifle through his papers, but Darla is there. Darla reveals she has been using a drug called Calynthia powder to keep Angel asleep while she manipulates his dreams. Angel wakes to find Cordelia and Wesley bickering about whether they should offer to pay Gunn. Angel and Wesley begin to discuss Angel's sleeping habits, but Cordelia suddenly gets a vision that sends Angel out to save a young girl from two potential rapists. As two men are about to attack the girl, she telekinetically slides a dumpster across the alleyway and smashes the men against a wall. At the crime scene, Angel pretends to be a detective in order to get information about the crime from an officer. He wanders inside an old building and finds the young girl from the alley. Scared, she sends a rebar through Angel's chest, although upon realizing that she didn't kill him, she seems a little less afraid. The girl returns to the apartment she's staying at, revealing her roommate to be Lilah. Gunn arrives to offer his help and Angel sends him out to find information on the men Bethany hurt. As Bethany drifts to sleep, she dreams of her abusive childhood and unintentionally sends a bedside lamp flying into Lilah, who was watching her fitful sleep. Terrified, Bethany flees from the apartment, throwing on a jacket. Bethany seeks Angel's help and they discuss her lack of control over her telekinetic powers. Holland stresses that if Lilah's work with Bethany is unsuccessful it could damage their other projects. Wesley deduces that Bethany has been sexually abused; when he pointedly mentions her father she loses control, sending both him and Angel flying through the air. That night, Bethany finds Angel in his bed and she offers herself to him, as the abuse she has suffered has led her to believe that she is just an object for use. He declines, and after they talk, he sends her back to her own bed. After Angel helps Bethany work to control her power, he meets Gunn at one of the potential rapists' apartment. He brings up the payment idea and Gunn agrees, meaning that Gunn is now officially part of Angel Investigations. They find evidence that someone paid for the attack on Bethany. Cordelia talks to Bethany over lattes until she is kidnapped by Wolfram & Hart's men. Angel and Gunn go after the men and Angel is able to get Bethany back from them. At the hotel, Bethany's father is used as a weapon to set her off and, as her control breaks, she causes serious structural damage to the building and lifting her father off his feet as she begins to telekinetically damage his body. Angel is able to break through to her, however and Bethany reveals that she has gained control over her powers by telling her father \\"Goodbye\\" before hurling him out of the window and allowing him to fall until she stops his descent five feet from the ground, letting him land unharmed. Her independence regained and her self-confidence increasing, Bethany calmly confronts Lilah and packs up her things, striking out on her own. Lilah and Angel speak on the doorstep as Lilah reminds him that he is not invited in. In a last-ditch effort to stop Bethany from trusting Angel, Lilah reveals that Angel is a vampire ‚Äì to which an unfazed Bethany merely replies; \\"weird.\\" As Bethany walks away, Angel says to Lilah, \\"It looks like you're going to have to find someone else's brain to play with,\\" to which Lilah replies, \\"Yeah, we have someone in mind.\\" Angel tells Lilah \\"Goodnight,\\" and, while he's walking away, Lilah snidely mutters \\"Sweet dreams.\\" Production details The shot in which Bethany telekinetically explodes every window in the hotel was done using special effects, says production designer Stuart Blatt. The Angel production department built a set matching the superficial layout of the outside of the hotel, and filmed a window of the set exploding. The visual effects designer took that image and tiled it over the intact windows: \\"Through the magic of digital medium.\\" Blatt says, \\"[we] created a whole wall of the hotel exploding.\\" Continuity *Cordelia refers to the Buffy episode \\"Lovers Walk\\" when she was impaled by a piece of steel rebar. *This episode marks Gunn's official, paid association with Angel Investigations, and introduces his signature weapon -- a large axe fashioned for him by some of his street crew from a hub cap and an axle -- which would remain with him until it is destroyed in season four. *Lilah's response to Angel's remark about playing with someone else's brain (\\"Yeah, we have someone in mind') is a reference to the resurrection of Darla, which is intended to emotionally devastate Angel, as well as to the upcoming 3rd season episode \\"That Vision Thing\\" wherein Wolfram & Hart do as much to Cordelia.

Prior to Fubon Group's acquisition of IBA, the primary shareholders of International Bank of Asia were Arab Banking Corporation (ABC) and China Everbright Group. History International Bank of Asia (IBA) was originally established as Sun Hung Kai Finance Company, the financing arm of Sun Hung Kai Securities. The name Sun Hung Kai Bank was adopted in 1982, when it received a multi-branch banking licence. The original Sun Hung Kai Bank shareholders included Banque Paribas, Merrill Lynch, and the family of Fung King-Hey (founder of Sun Hung Kai Securities). In 1985, Ahmet D. Arsan, Asia Head of Arab Banking Corporation (ABC), arranged for ABC to acquire 75% of Sun Hung Kai Bank, which, at the time, was suffering from sub-optimal results and was ripe for a take-over. Arsan was an influential Turkish-American banker who ABC had recruited in 1982 to head ABC Asia Pacific, after his success, years earlier, in establishing the Asia Pacific arm of First Chicago (now JPMorgan Asia). Immediately following the 1985 acquisition of Sun Hung Kai Bank by ABC, Arsan made sweeping changes in the bank, ranging from the executive management team and most of the bank's staff, to the bank's entire set of operating procedures, on which all employees were trained. In 1986, Arsan changed the institution's name and re-branded the organisation as International Bank of Asia (IBA); (Ê∏ØÂü∫ÂúãÈöõÈäÄË°å). Ahmet D. Arsan was the founding chief executive officer and managing director of International Bank of Asia (IBA) from 1985 to 1989, after which Arsan left IBA and established a private Hong Kong based trading firm. In 1990, following Arsan's departure, ABC acquired the remaining 25% of IBA shares, making IBA a wholly owned subsidiary of ABC, until October 1993 when China Everbright Group became a 20% stake holder. In November 1990, IBA was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In February 2004 Fubon Financial Holding Co., Ltd., a member of Taiwanese financial institution Fubon Group, in an acquisition of IBA shares from both ABC and China Everbright Group, acquired a 75% stake in IBA. The M&A; advisor was Citigroup Global Markets. At the 2005 Fubon Group annual general meeting, the Fubon board approved for IBA to adopt the Fubon name. On 6 April 2005, IBA was renamed Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited. Fubon Bank (Hong Kong) Limited operates 25 retail outlets in Hong Kong including 22 branches and 3 Securities Services Centers, and provides a wide range of financial services encompassing consumer and wholesale banking, wealth management, financial markets, hire purchase, securities brokerage and investment services. Fubon Bank is listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (stock code: 636) and holds an A-2 short-term, BBB+ long-term rating from S&P.; The rating reflects Fubon Bank's strong capitalisation, good liquidity and sound asset quality.

Summary After Angel finally meets Darla outside of his dreams, she kicks her mind games into full force in order to turn him back over to the dark side, while Wesley and Cordelia fear for Angel‚Äôs sanity. Meanwhile, Lindsey plans to have Darla, who turns out to be a perfectly normal human resurrected, frame Angel for a string of murders, and have Kate Lockley track Angel down for them hoping to either turn him, or kill him. Also, a flashback to 1860 England shows Angel and Darla as a wandering vampire couple who target a wealthy noblewoman named Drusilla with psychic abilities, and who goes insane after Angel kills her whole family. Expanded overview Angel wakes up to even more bickering from Cordelia and Wesley then Cordelia gets a vision with sketchy details. While Cordelia and Wesley try to find the demon and location from Cordelia's vision, Angel daydreams of Darla. The entire gang arrive at a convent where two groups of cloaked men are fighting in front of a Thrall demon. The men then attack Angel and friends. Gunn uses his new ax to destroy the demon and all the cloaked men stop fighting. Walking home, Angel is shocked to see Darla walking the streets. In the past, Angel walks through the streets until he finds Darla, after she killed two people. She points out a young woman to Angel, who we recognize as Drusilla. Angel takes the young woman, pure and with the gift of visions, as a challenge. A potential paying customer presents a case to Cordelia and Wesley about his wife who is cheating on him with another man. Angel tells Wesley and Cordelia about seeing Darla in his dreams and in real life but they think he's starting to lose his sanity. Lindsey and Darla talk about Angel and how he's progressing. At a police station, Kate works a desk job where she receives notice from a friend that Angel has moved his company into the old Hyperion Hotel. Angel Investigations spy on a woman having an affair, but Angel spoils their cover by confronting the woman and telling her to talk to her husband. As they're leaving, Angel spots Darla but when he confronts her, she's human and claims to be DeEtta Kramer. Angel sings \\"Everybody Have Fun Tonight\\" at the demon bar in order to get information about Darla from The Host but gets no answers. Angel finds the Kramer home and lurks outside while inside, Darla waits for the plan to take form. Stephen reveals himself to be nothing more than an actor, posing as a husband for Darla. Meanwhile, Cordelia and Wesley warn Gunn about the dangers of an evil Angel and Darla combined. In a flashback, Angelus and Darla fool around while a frightened human Drusilla watches on. Although Darla doesn't seem to approve, Angel announces that he'll make Drusilla a vampire. Darla and Lindsey's plan goes into effect when Angel breaks into her home in time to find himself setup for murdering Darla's supposed husband. The police arrive on scene, but Angel is able to escape without getting captured. Kate talks with Darla on the scene, but when Kate turns her back, Angel grabs Darla and takes her away to the convent. He does everything he can to bring the real Darla to the fore and with some persuasion, she does. The two kiss and Darla tries to convince Angel to let her make him happy. He tells her she never made him happy, but still she persists and tries to bring his demon out. With plenty of backup, Kate breaks into the hotel to search for Angel. She's determined to believe that Angel is and always will be evil. Cordelia and Wesley try to convince Kate that Darla was once a vampire and that Angel didn't kill anyone. Darla refuses to give up on Angel, but she leaves him underground until sunset. Angel broods in his room until Cordelia and Wesley confront him to make sure he's not evil. He tells them that much trouble is on the way, and he's looking forward to it. Writing *While David Greenwalt is the credited writer for this episode, significant scenes between Angel and Darla were actually written by Marti Noxon. *The conversation Wesley and Cordelia have about Cordelia's visions (and how they affect Wesley's salary) mirrors one between Cordelia and Doyle at the end of the season one episode \\"I Fall to Pieces.\\" =Arc significance= *Wolfram & Hart's plan to turn Angel over to their side becomes more clear as Darla's manipulation has a strong effect on him. *The Angel Investigations team and Kate all find out Darla has been brought back by Wolfram and Hart, albeit as a human. *Angel learns that Darla was actually present during the dreams he had about her in previous episodes.

Written by Jane Espenson and directed by Krishna Rao, it was originally broadcast on November 7, 2000 on the WB network. In \\"Guise Will Be Guise\\", Angel seeks out the guidance of a swami, while Wesley is forced to impersonate Angel when a powerful businessman demands that Angel guard his daughter Virginia. However, the swami is an impostor trying to keep Angel away from Los Angeles so that one of Virginia's father's competitors can capture her. He wants to do this so she can't be ritually sacrificed, which would give her father great power. Plot Angel tries to hunt down Darla at Wolfram & Hart, but Cordelia and Wesley stop him. Angel consults the demon Host at the karaoke bar Caritas, who refers him to Swami T'ish Magev for help. Cordelia and Wesley hold down the office while Angel is away, both glad that he is seeking help to calm his obsession with Darla. At the office, a thug holds Cordelia at gunpoint, demanding to see Angel, and Wesley is forced to pose as their vampire boss in order to save her. Magnus Bryce, a shrewd and rich businessman, is in need of Angel's services to protect his daughter from assassins from a rival corporation fronted by Paul Lanier. He offers Wesley blood that he forces down, to keep from ruining his cover. Wesley meets Mr. Bryce's daughter, Virginia, and then the two go shopping. Virginia and Wesley talk about how she wants freedom from the prison her father's created for her, then the two kiss. Virginia initially stops, believing Angel's curse is an obstacle, but Wesley claims it is more of a 'recommendation' than anything else ‚Äî and the two have sex. Meanwhile, at a quiet cabin, Angel talks with the normal-looking Swami about his choice of clothing, style of car, and brand of hair gel. The Swami advises Angel to find a blond woman and break her heart, so he will feel better about his situation with Darla. Later, the Swami talks to Paul Lanier over the phone, revealing that he's an imposter (one of the bartenders at Caritas overheard Angel and the Host's conversation and tipped Lanier off about Angel's destination). Through their conversation, in which they both believe Angel is with them, they deduce that Wesley is not Angel. Lanier informs Bryce that there is a fake protecting Virginia - a bodyguard who is able to have sex with his virgin daughter. Gunn sets off to find Angel, but when he arrives at the cabin the fake swami knocks him out. Angel witnesses this, and uses a fishing pole to pull the man out of the sun and into his grasp. Cordelia arrives at the Bryce home, but before she can rescue Wesley, Virginia finds out that he's not really Angel. In order to get a significant amount of power from a demon, Bryce plans to sacrifice his daughter as the demon will grant immense power to anyone who sacrifices a virgin on their 50th birthday (hence why Bryce chose Angel to be her bodyguard, as the curse would have prevented the two from having sex). Angel and Wesley conclude that Lanier was trying to prevent the sacrifice so that Bryce wouldn't get the power. Bryce starts the sacrificial ritual, but Angel and crew interrupt. The demon appears, but won't take Virginia as a sacrifice because she is not a virgin. Furious about her father's actions, Virginia punches him and disassociates herself from him, revealing that she hasn't been a virgin since she was sixteen. After reading an article in a magazine, both Cordelia and Angel are jealous that Wesley is getting so much publicity as Virginia's bodyguard. Production Alexis Denisof enjoyed playing Angel in this episode, although when the BBC asked him what the props team used for the fake blood he had to drink, he was unsure. \\"I should find out,\\" he says. \\"I haven‚Äôt been feeling well ever since.\\" =Acting= While Cordelia is looking through the criminal database, series producer Kelly A. Manners can be seen on a photo under the name Irwin Oliver. =Writing= In an essay comparing the character of Angel to \\"melancholy loner\\" Lord Byron, Amy-Chinn points out that Angel's obsession with his appearance - a running joke in the series - is overtly mocked in this episode, when the swami asks Angel why he dresses in black and drives a black convertible, despite the LA heat and his vampire sensitivity to sunlight. =Arc significance= *This marks the start of Wesley becoming a more fully developed, independent demon fighter in his own right, rather than simply providing the team with information and getting in the way of his allies. *This episode marks the first appearance of Virginia Bryce, who appears in three other episodes.

The Carro di Tespi lirico brought opera to many Italian cities that did not have regular opera seasons, as well as some that did. It normally toured in July, August and September to about forty locations with two or three operas. Troupes occasionally would perform directly from the back of their traveling trucks or wagons.

Biography Van Beinum was born in Arnhem, Netherlands, where he received his first violin and piano lessons at an early age. He joined the Arnhem Orchestra as a violinist in 1918. His grandfather was conductor of a military band. His father played the double bass in the local symphony orchestra, the Arnhemse Orkest (later Het Gelders Orkest). His brother Co van Beinum was a violinist, and the two brothers performed as a violin-piano duo in concerts. As a student at the Amsterdam Conservatoire, he gained conducting experience with several concerts by amateur ensembles in Schiedam and Zutphen. He also conducted concerts by the choir of the church of St. Nicholas in Amsterdam. = Concertgebouw Orchestra = Van Beinum was the conductor of the Haarlem Orchestral Society from 1927 to 1931. He first conducted the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam, in 1929. He became second conductor of the orchestra in 1931, under the supervision of Willem Mengelberg. In 1938 he was named co-principal conductor, alongside Mengelberg. After World War II, Mengelberg was dismissed as principal conductor because of controversy over his (still-disputed) behavior and attitude towards the Nazi occupiers in the Netherlands. According to Kees Wisse, van Beinum \\"detested the Nazis and kept himself as aloof as he could.\\"Wisse, Kees (translated Lodewijk Od√©, Ko Kooman and Chris Gordon), Liner notes to Q-Disc Issue \\"Eduard Van Beinum: The Radio Recordings\\", Q-Disc 97015. Van Beinum refused to conduct a 1943 benefit concert for the Nazis, and threatened to resign as co-principal conductor if forced to conduct that event. Van Beinum did receive a reprimand after the post-war de-Nazification activities, but this was not so severe as to keep him from his post with the Concertgebouw. Van Beinum remained as sole principal conductor of the orchestra after the war. In 1947, van Beinum became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), but left after two successful seasons. According to Michael Kennedy in his biography of Sir Adrian Boult, van Beinum was \\"not well\\", which led the LPO to seek Boult as a successor to him. In general, van Beinum suffered from health problems, including a heart condition, which left him unable to conduct for much of the 1950‚Äì1951 season of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Van Beinum made his US guest- conducting debut in 1954, with the Philadelphia Orchestra. He took the Concertgebouw Orchestra on its first U.S. tour later in 1954. In 1956, the year of van Beinum's 25th anniversary with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, he was invested as a Grand Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau, and also received an honorary doctorate from the University of Amsterdam.Obituary for Eduard van Beinum (1959). The Musical Times, 100 (1396), p. 346. Van Beinum's recordings with the Concertgebouw Orchestra are available on the Philips and Decca labels. Outside of the Netherlands, he also served as music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1956 to 1959. Van Beinum suffered a fatal heart attack on 13 April 1959, on the Concertgebouw podium while rehearsing the orchestra for a performance of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 1. He was buried in Garderen, in the Veluwe region, where he maintained a residence. After his death, the Eduard van Beinum Foundation was established in 1960. Van Beinum was married to Sepha Jansen, a violinist with the Concertgebouw Orchestra. In 2000, their son, Bart van Beinum, published a book about his father, Eduard van Beinum, over zijn leven en werk. In 2004, Truus de Leur published her biography of van Beinum, Eduard van Beinum, 1900-1959 - Musicus tussen musici ('Eduard van Beinum, 1900-1959 - Musician among musicians'). In the course of her research, de Leur commented on her research to look for negative as well as positive aspects about van Beinum's personality: : \\"Ik heb echt gezocht, ook al omdat mijn redacteuren mij waarschuwden dat het geen hagiografie mocht worden.

Written and directed by Tim Minear, it was originally broadcast on November 14, 2000 on the WB television network. In this episode, Angel tries to rescue Darla from the clutches of Wolfram & Hart and Lindsey's affections, as she suffers guilt of her demonic past. Flashbacks show Darla as a syphilis-stricken prostitute being transformed into a vampire by the demonic Master, her retaliation when the Gypsies cursed Angelus with a soul, and the Boxer Rebellion in China. Many of the flashback scenes echo the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode \\"Fool for Love\\", which was originally broadcast earlier the same night. Plot Angel sits alone drawing pictures of Darla, when Wesley appears in the doorway and expresses his concern that Angel has become obsessed. Angel brushes him off. Meanwhile, Lindsey comes into a room to find Darla curled in a corner, bleeding, haunted by memories of her past. In 1609, Colony of Virginia, the human prostitute Darla lies in her deathbed, covered in sores from the syphilis that is killing her. She receives a visit from the Master, who takes her life and makes her a vampire. Back in the present, Angel is trying to locate Darla, over the objections of the group, who suggest Wolfram and Hart may just be trying to keep him distracted. Gunn suggests that they probably have connections to the place where she's staying, and Angel gives criteria for the kind of place she would want to live. They go off to check into it. In 1760 Darla brings Angelus before the Master, bragging about her wonderful new creation. Angelus is less impressed, and his disrespect gets him beaten up. Nevertheless, Darla chooses Angelus over the Master, and goes with him. In 1880, while strolling the streets of London, Angelus, Darla, and Drusilla bump into a man named William, later known as Spike. In need of companionship, Drusilla makes him into a vampire. The team at Angel investigations has found a likely location for Darla's new home, and Cordelia confirms it by playing a sob story for a clerk. Angel starts to rush off, but Wesley stops him, saying that he and Gunn will look into the situation and they'll make any decisions later as a group. Angel starts to object until Cordelia points out that it's one in the afternoon, and the area doesn't have good sun cover. Meanwhile, Darla receives another visit from Lindsey. She is visibly upset, shaken by her memories and disturbed by the experience of having a soul and being human again. She expresses confusion about who she is now, then asks Lindsey why he hasn't kissed her - he obviously wants to. He said he didn't know what she wanted, and she asks why he should care; she never considered anyone else. In 1898 Darla threatens a Gypsy, wanting him to revoke the curse on Angelus in exchange for not killing his family. Unfortunately before he can answer Spike emerges from the caravan, having already slaughtered his wife and daughter. Frustrated, Darla snaps the man's neck. Angel looks at pictures of the room where Darla was staying. All the reflective surfaces are smashed, but there is no sign of forced entry - or wasn't until Gunn and Wesley broke in. Angel says she is feeling the weight of her soul. Cordelia points out that Angel doesn't run around smashing mirrors, and he answers that he doesn't have to face himself in them. He insists they have to help her, brushing off Cordelia when she tries to hand him the phone until she tells him it's Darla on the other end. Darla asks him to help, and tells Lindsey that Angel is the only one who can do anything for her. When a security guard tries to stop her from leaving, a shot is heard, and he falls. A later discussion between Lindsay and Holland indicates the guard is dead, and that Darla has been caught. Lindsey is told he is off the project. Angel leaves to go find Darla and help her. Wesley tries to warn him to be careful, telling him he should know what Darla was. Angel corrects him, saying it was what they both were - and that having been through it, he might be able to help her. When Wesley reminds him that he went over a century without seeking redemption, Angel replies that he sought Darla instead. During the Boxer Rebellion in China, Angel tracks down Darla, and - despite being cursed with a soul - asks her for a second chance to rule at her side. Angel attacks Lindsey in a parking garage. Lindsey tells him Darla is in trouble, that they plan to kill her. Angel promises to come back and kill him if he's lying. Angel, back in the Boxer Rebellion, comes upon a terrified family of missionaries and distracts his companions from them. Drusilla tells them that Spike has killed his first Slayer. Angel tries to act excited, but drops the act when Drusilla fixates on the alley where he left the family and instead tries to convince the others to leave. Angel returns to Darla after going out to feed on animals. She tells him she noticed that he only killed the guilty in the riots, and demands he prove he's truly evil. She says she went back and killed the family in the alleyway, but kept their baby, which she wants him to kill. Darla sits up suddenly, staring in fear at three people in white with guns as Angel's car appears behind her. She is thrown aside, and after defeating the three men, Angel runs to her. In the lobby of Wolfram and Hart, Lindsey sees the supposedly murdered guard very much alive. He talks to Holland, accusing him of playing him. Holland says they had to make the crisis real. Lindsey speaks derisively of the idea that Angel would achieve his moment of perfect happiness with Darla under the circumstances, but Holland tells him he doesn't understand the plan - that they expect Angel to save the dying woman - by turning her into a vampire. Darla wakes up, and whispers \\"Angelus\\" when she sees Angel. Cordelia corrects her. She says she's lucky to have someone who understands - something Angel never had. She wants him to turn her back, saying she can't bear to feel her own heartbeat. Angel tells her it's a gift to be human, but she disagrees, and demands he \\"return the favor\\" for turning him into a vampire. Angel backs away, stunned that she still considers what she did to him a gift. When she instead tries to convince him to turn her as revenge, he refuses. Looking down at the baby, Angel confesses he can't pretend to be who he's not. She says she's disgusted with him. He takes the baby and jumps through a window. Darla runs out of the office, telling Angel not to look for her again, mirroring the words of a century ago. Production Composer Robert J. Kral says this is his favorite episode to have scored, as he was able to write several different themes for the character of Darla. He was asked by director Tim Minear to write music that was \\"epochy. Something with horns...something Wagnerish.\\" Kral and Buffy composer Thomas Wanker deliberately choose not to collaborate, so that the cross-over scenes would \\"maintain a different perspective,\\" Kral says. Production designer Stuart Blatt says the Boxer Rebellion flashback scenes in this episode and \\"Fool for Love\\" were filmed at a movie ranch with a standing set for a Mexican village. \\"Through our research,\\" Blatt says, \\"we realized that a lot of Chinese towns looked very similar to small Mexican villages...clay adobe structures with either thatched or tower roofs.\\" Gaffer Dan Kerns explains that to simulate the burning streets, his crew set up numerous 'flicker boxes' that \\"pulse like a flame\\", in addition to simulated moonlight from \\"cherry picker\\"-like machines. =Acting= Actress Julie Benz says the flashback scenes are \\"the high points\\" of playing Darla; her favorite scene is the Boxer Rebellion. Gaffer Dan Kerns' girlfriend Heidi Strickler appears in that scene, playing the frightened mother in the alley whom Angel attempts to shelter. =Writing= This episode was writer Tim Minear's directorial debut. He says he felt it was time to explore Darla's history, which \\"should really be her story with Angel throughout the 150 years that they were together.\\" When Joss Whedon pointed out that they were already doing a Spike origin story on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Minear suggested they do both. Although this episode shows Angel and Darla's romantic history, Minear cautions, \\"at no time was I trying to play this as being Angel's true love. It's more like the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?; this troubled, old married couple with secrets. I wasn't trying to take Buffy's place in his heart by any stretch of the imagination. But here's a guy who's been around for a couple of hundred years before he ever met Buffy and certainly he was shaped in some way.\\" He explains that despite cries of retconning from fans ‚Äî who saw in the Buffy episode \\"Becoming, Part One\\" that Angel was living on the streets of New York in the early 1990s ‚Äî he doesn't believe Angel was \\"thrown out of that room in Romania by Darla in 1898 and has been on the street ever since.\\" Minear likens the storytelling approach in this episode to the non- linear, looping technique exhibited by Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction: \\"It's a different story happening in the same universe.\\" Reception This episode won \\"Best Period Hair Styling in a Series\\" at the Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards. Joss Whedon stated this episode as his all-time favorite episode, during an \\"Attack of the Show\\" interview.

Written by Jim Kouf and directed by David Grossman, it was originally broadcast on November 21, 2000 on the WB network. In this episode, Angel and Charles Gunn go undercover as part of a group of demonic thieves in order to foil the theft of a demonic burial shroud at a museum, unaware that the garment has supernatural mind-altering properties. Plot Two detectives interrogate Wesley about an attempted murder. Wesley tells them everything just went very wrong. Without revealing the vampire's name, Wesley explains disjointedly that Angel wasn't supposed to be there, that Wesley would have stopped him if they'd \\"found out sooner\\". Earlier, Wesley stops by the Hyperion and talks with Cordelia. He notices she's changed her hair, and she tells him she did it ten days ago. Cordelia and Wesley go to a movie premiere, while Angel and Gunn meet with Gunn's cousin, Lester, who asked for their help. Lester is supposed to be a driver for a demonic robbery but he wants nothing to do with it. A vampire Angel knows by reputation, Jay-Don, is being brought in to help. To Gunn's dismay, Angel takes charge of the case and tells Gunn he'll handle it by himself. Angel returns to the hotel and finds Kate in his room. She wants information on Darla and despite the cross she carries, Angel is not threatened and warns her to back off before she is killed. Angel meets Jay-Don at the bus station and kills him, taking his place on the robbery. A demon named Menlow meets with Angel, who he thinks is Jay- Don, and takes him to the others. Another demon, Vyasa, and a human security guard, Bob, are already present, waiting for Lester. Gunn shows up in Lester's place. Angel is annoyed that Gunn didn't listen to him, but can't do anything about it without blowing their cover. The robbery team runs over the plan, explaining that they'll be stealing the Shroud of Rahmon. Jay-don - now Angel - is there to get past sensors that detect changes in body heat. Angel, trying to get a chance to talk privately with Gunn, picks a fight with him, but the others stop him before he can get outside. Cordelia researches museums to find which one may be the location of the robbery, learning the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles temporarily contains the Shroud of Rahmon, intended to prevent the insanity-creating Rahmon from being resurrected. Instead, the shroud absorbed the power to make people around it insane. Meanwhile, the thieves break into the museum. Angel tries to keep Gunn outside, but they others insist he come in. They break into the vault holding the shroud, where the Shroud's presence begins to cause the group to act erratically. Wesley and Cordelia enter the building and are immediately affected as well. The robbery group carries the consecrated box with the enclosed shroud on a path out of the building, becoming more violent towards each other. Vyasa kills Bob by ripping off his head. Wesley encounters Kate at the building and has trouble keeping focused on his mission to help Angel. Wesley finds Angel and tries to warn him about the shroud. Kate finds Angel and the others and pulls a gun on them. Angel knocks her gun out of the way and bites her neck, and she falls to the ground, motionless. A police team arrives and finds Wesley leaning over Kate's body. The shroud box is carried to another building and the shroud's effect on the group leads them all to fight over it, breaking the box open and grabbing the shroud. Gunn and Angel play tug of war with the shroud until Angel manages to come to his senses enough to convince Gunn to let go. After taking the shroud outside and dousing it in alcohol, Angel sets it aflame, stopping its effects. In the interrogation room, the detectives are convinced that Wesley is the killer. As they're about to arrest him, Kate shows up and tells them to let him go. She remembers that Angel did bite her briefly, but it was actually a ruse to prevent her from being killed by the demons. Wesley and Cordelia think about what happened, and Wesley worries that Angel's bloodlust has been reawakened by the taste of human blood. Angel sits in his room, his thoughts focused on biting Kate.

The episode was written by Doug Petrie and Tim Minear with a story from David Greenwalt and directed by Bruce Seth Green, this episode was originally broadcast on November 28, 2000 on the WB network. In \\"The Trial\\", Darla discovers that she is again terminally ill with syphilis, which was killing her before she was made a vampire in 1609. She begs Angel to turn her back into a vampire to halt the disease's progress, but instead he engages in a series of mysterious trials to attempt to win Darla a second chance at life. Summary After Darla discovers that she is terminally ill with syphilis once again and will die soon, she tries to get vampires to feed off her in order to become a vampire again. Unsuccessful, Darla contacts Angel to help her. Angel, following the guidance of the Caritas Host, enters into a series of three mysterious trials in an attempt to save her life. But the downside is that he could get both of them killed in the process. Meanwhile, Lindsey decides to try and turn Darla back to the dark side. =Expanded overview= Cordelia and Wesley talk about Angel while Angel is down in the basement, doing his laundry. Gunn has located Darla at the Royal Viking Motel, but Lindsey has gotten to her first. Lindsey and Holland confront Darla with information about her health. Angel and Gunn check out the motel room, but find little information. In France, 1765, Angelus and Darla run from a vampire hunter and hide in a barn. As the mob closes in, Darla knocks Angelus down and leaves on the only horse. In present time, Darla tries to talk a young male vampire into making her a vampire. Outside, in an alley, Angel stakes the vampire before he can bite Darla. They talk and Darla reveals that she is terminally ill and only has a few months left to live. Angel brings Darla to the hotel and expresses that he doubts the truth of the records Wolfram and Hart showed her. Angel visits Lindsey and finds that Darla really is dying. Lindsey reveals that Darla is dying from syphilis, the same disease that was killing her when she was first sired by the Master. Angel takes Darla to the demon karaoke bar where she sings beautifully while the Host talks to Angel. He tells Angel of the only way to save Darla, but it may mean Angel's death. Angel dives into an empty pool and into an underground location where he must survive three trials to save Darla's life. Angel is advised by a valet before being left in a room to fight unarmed against a large demon that has weapons. Angel eventually slices the demon in two, and chains the pieces to opposite sides of the room. From the safety of another room, Darla watches. Angel moves onto another room that consists of crosses covering the walls and floors. After crossing the burning ground, Angel must fish a key out of a bowl filled with holy water. Chained spread-eagle before a wall of wooden stakes, Angel finds that the third trial requires him to die in order for Darla to live. The valet presents Angel with his options, but Angel is willing to give his life, and that enough to pass the test. The valet gives Angel and Darla bad news though as it is revealed that Darla is already living her second chance at life. Furious, Angel violently attacks the room that surrounds them, truly distraught that after everything he went through, he couldn't save Darla. Upon returning to the surface, Darla is accepting of her fate and Angel is there to support her. Lindsey and several large men break into the room and restrain Angel and Darla. Drusilla makes a shocking return and while Angel watches, she makes Darla a vampire, again.

Plot synopsis Angel tells his associates that Drusilla has returned and, working with Wolfram and Hart, has made Darla a vampire again. Wesley and Cordelia investigate the law firm's plans for Drusilla and Darla as Angel prepares to stake the two vampires. Angel tracks down Lindsay, who has been sheltering Drusilla and Darla. He attempts to stake the unconscious Darla, but Drusilla attacks him. Darla revives as Angel and Drusilla struggle; she escapes and Drusilla disappears. At Wolfram and Hart, Holland and Lindsey are discussing the evening's planned party when Drusilla arrives to update them on recent events. Darla appears and drags Drusilla off. As Angel races to the W&H; offices, Cordelia has a vision which sends them elsewhere. The angry Darla and Drusilla quarrel; Drusilla reveals why Darla was resurrected, and Darla, after bloodsucking and killing a fresh victim, has her old personality restored. Darla and Drusilla go shopping. Angel brusquely completes the mission from Cordelia's vision, then heads back toward Wolfram & Hart. Holland unleashes Darla and Drusilla on Los Angeles; they begin by raiding a clothing store for new wardrobes, killing two salespeople. Angel forces his way into Wolfram and Hart, demanding information. Lindsey refuses; Angel is arrested and taken into custody by Kate. She releases him, hoping he can stop Darla and Drusilla's killing spree. Holland hosts a wine tasting party for his colleagues in his home's wine cellar. As he makes a speech, Darla and Drusilla appear, intent on slaughter. Holland attempts to convince the two that he and his associates are their allies, to little effect. Angel finds a survivor at the clothing store and learns where Darla and Drusilla have gone. When he arrives at Holland's home, however, he refuses to stop Darla and Drusilla, instead locking the wine cellar to prevent the lawyers from escaping the vampires. When Angel tells his associates what he has done, they object, fearing that Angel is descending into corruption and \\"darkness.\\" He fires them and leaves.

In this episode, demon snitch Merl reveals Wolfram & Hart is scheming to steal money from contributions made to a shelter for runaways, prompting Angel to investigate the shelter's owner, Anne Steele. Meanwhile, Cordelia, Wesley, and Gunn, still fighting demons without Angel, decide to form their own detective agency. Plot At Cordelia's apartment, Wesley and Gunn play the board game Risk, until Cordelia tries to kick them out so she can sleep. They discuss plans to start their own company without Angel until Cordelia gets a vision about a large two-headed, fire- breathing demon. Angel bumps into a woman, Anne Steele, who runs a local teen center. Back at the Hyperion, Angel takes out her wallet, which he had stolen from her during their encounter and observes a board filled dozens of pictures of Anne, including shots of her with Lindsey McDonald. Wesley and Gunn slowly approach the demon from Cordelia's vision in the sewers and find a 20-foot demon. After some hesitation, they charge at it. Angel confronts Merl in his apartment, demanding information about Anne. She's connected to Wolfram & Hart but despite a couple of name changes in the past, the woman herself is clean, so Angel visits the shelter and talks to her. Anne raves about Wolfram & Hart's help with the shelter and the plans for a charity fundraiser named the Highway Robbery Ball to gather money with the help of celebrities. A large demon named Boone confronts Merl for information on Angel and Merl is persuaded to provide that information. Angel surprises Lilah in her car and threatens her. Lilah tells Lindsey how worried she is about Angel, but their discussion is cut short as Boone arrives unannounced, wanting to deal with a grudge against Angel. Boone explains his past with Angel: In 1916, in a skirmish regarding a woman, they fought for hours until sunrise approached; knowing the sun would kill Angel, Boone, who considers himself an honorable warrior, let Angel depart. He has longed for a rematch ever since, in order to learn which of them is the better warrior. Wesley and Gunn rave about slaying the demon and despite their incredible fear, they're excited about their victory. The group leaves to look at a prospective location for their new business while arguing over its name. Angel shows up at the shelter late at night, and Anne jokingly asks if he is stalking her. Angel offers all the evidence necessary to confirm that he is, and then tries to warn her that Wolfram & Hart are going to steal money from the fundraiser. Lindsey arrives and pretends to be protecting Anne, bringing Boone with him to fight with Angel. Lindsey tries to defend the law firm to Anne but the information Angel's provided her worries Lindsey, and he discusses the dangerous possibilities with Lilah. Wounded from the fight, Angel returns to the shelter and Anne expresses that she is willing to ignore the source of the money if it means aid to the shelter. Angel gives her a tape to play at the fundraiser, but Anne refuses to risk the shelter. At the Ball, a prerecorded video of Holland plays. Lilah introduces Anne to one of her bosses, Nathan Reed, while Lindsey reviews the security plans for the ball. While actors collect the donations from the rich attendees, Angel reveals his presence, which leads to a fight between him and Boone on the balcony, and they eventually fall to the main floor. Lindsey searches for the incriminating tape, but it is revealed that Angel is not in possession of the tape and Boone is actually working with him. Lindsey and Lilah desperately attempt to stop Anne from playing the tape Angel gave her, but it only contains goofy clips of Cordelia and Wesley, as Angel never had anything to incriminate the lawyers in the first place. To add even more embarrassment to the situation for Wolfram & Hart, Boone has taken off with the donations. The next day Lindsey confronts Reed about not being able to kill Angel, and Reed explains that Angel is an important figure in the upcoming apocalypse, and because his role, he must remain untouched as long as there is a chance Wolfram & Hart can win him to the side of evil. Boone confronts Angel at the hotel, offering up the 2.5 million dollars in charity donations as the stakes for a fight between the two of them. Again wounded from battle with Boone (it is unclear if Angel, who clearly won the fight, killed Boone or not), Angel presents the money and jewelry to Anne for the shelter, who is undisturbed by the real and metaphorical blood on the money.

In it, Angel and the Host must stop a man who wishes to stop time itself after he learns his girlfriend is about to break up with him. Meanwhile, Wesley, Gunn and Cordelia attempt to find clients for their new detective agency without Angel. Plot synopsis Wesley and Cordelia, cleaning up their new office, discuss their future as investigators without Angel, and most likely without enough clients to keep their business running for long. At the hotel, Angel awakes to the sounds of the Host singing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" down in the lobby. He tells Angel about a man who came to sing at Caritas, and that when he read the man's aura, the Host was knocked out when he realized the world would be ending. Unfortunately, the man left before the Host came around and the Host currently has no idea who or where the man is. The man singing at the bar was actually a physicist named Gene Rainey, who is working on a formula to stop time. His girlfriend, Denise, visits him and they talk of their plans for their first anniversary. Without any other leads on Gene, Angel and the Host check out karaoke bars and are pointed towards the college that Gene attends. After an unsuccessful attempt to test his formula, Gene leaves his work area and two Lubber demons emerge from the shadows to alter the formula Gene has been working on. Wesley, Gunn and Cordelia mope about their job troubles but Virginia stops by with food, champagne, and a case they can take to earn a lot of money. Gene is successful with the initial test of his equipment. Angel and the Host check out yearbooks at the college library to look for the name of the man. Denise confesses to her friend that she has to break up with Gene because things aren't working out, and plans to break up with him that night after sleeping with him. Gene overhears this and returns to the lab, dejected. While getting directions to Gene and the physics lab, Angel is attacked by the Lubber demons. Finally, at the physics lab, it is discovered that Gene is gone and so is his equipment. He has plans to freeze time during a moment of love between him and Denise. Gunn kills the demon that he and the others were hired to protect a rich family from. Wesley discovers the real truth behind the murder, that one of the family hired the demon to kill one of the men and gain control of the family money. Angel and the Host take care of several Lubber demons who tried to stand in the way, then rush to stop Gene before it is too late. Gene freezes Denise and himself in a moment of passion, but Angel is able to get past several more Lubber demons then stop the machine and undo the whole process. Gene says he didn't know the overall effects of his actions; he just didn't want to lose his love. However, Angel and the Host tell Gene that things need to keep moving on, otherwise it wouldn't be interesting. As Gene goes to get some beer, the Host tells Angel that this is the first time in a long time that he is connecting with someone. Angel reflects on how he treated his team, and feels bad knowing he left them out in the cold. At their new office, Wesley, Cordelia and Gunn party in celebration of their success until a man shows up in need of their services. Arc Significance Angel reveals to the Host that he fired his team and cut off all ties to keep them away from consequences they couldn't handle (like forcing them to do terrible things to destroy Wolfram & Hart with them), even if it meant mistreating them. Notes The physics building featured in the episode where Gene Rainey's lab is located shows the exterior of the Valley Life Sciences Building at the University of California, Berkeley.

Co-written by Jim Kouf and Shawn Ryan and directed by Scott McGinnis, it was originally broadcast on February 13, 2001 on the WB network. In \\"The Thin Dead Line\\", Anne, the administrator of a homeless shelter, asks Gunn to investigate a squad of zombie policemen who have been assaulting street kids. While Angel teams up with Detective Kate Lockley to investigate the source of the undead cops, Wesley ends up getting shot by one of the policemen and Gunn, Anne and some street kids hole up in the shelter while the zombie policemen try to claw their way in. Plot A friend of Virginia brings her daughter to the soon- to-be-renamed Angel Investigations, asking them to remove the eye that grew out of the back of her head after she was attacked by an unseen assailant. Wesley assures the mother that they will find a way to get rid of the eye. Meanwhile, Angel is feeling the increasing weight of his self-imposed solitude. As he walks round the hotel lobby and stands at the desk where his team used to gather, he can't help but feel lonelier than ever and in a fit of anger he shoves a pile of papers off the desk. At a teen shelter, two teens show up after curfew in search of safety, and their fear convinces shelter administrator Anne to make an exception to the rules. Kenny explains that he and Len were unfairly attacked by a policeman, which has been happening to other street kids as well. Anne takes the problem to Gunn at Angel Investigations. He accompanies her back to the shelter and questions the kids about the incidents with the police. Angel, who has surreptitiously trailed Gunn, is attacked by a policeman while standing outside. Angel fights back, but the officer rises every time he's knocked down, until the vampire kicks the cop's head completely off and even then, the head keeps talking for a moment. When Angel asks Detective Kate Lockley to look up the dead cop's badge, she finds that he's been dead for six months. More sleuthing reveals that someone is putting dead cops back on the streets as zombies. Cordelia rants about Gunn's decision to call in several members of his old crew to deal with the police, but she and Wesley resolve to go back him up anyway. They find Gunn and his friends secretly filming their exchange with a police officer, to demonstrate that cops are reacting violently without just cause. Wesley tries to save Gunn, but the cop turns and shoots him. A struggle takes place and George shoots the cop. The three men move Wesley to safety as the cop sits up, seemingly unaffected by the bullets. Gunn and friends get Wesley into an ambulance, but as they're driving away, several police cars get in the way. When the driver is shot, Gunn is forced to drive the ambulance. He eventually stops at the shelter and carries Wesley inside with the EMT, who warns that Wesley needs to get to a hospital fast. The teens barricade the shelter with everything they can find as an army of dead cops gather outside. The zombie cops force their way inside the shelter through the windows and doors, hurting several teens in the process. Angel visits the precinct where the zombie cops were from. The police captain confesses that he has been using supernatural means to return good cops to the streets and protect previously violence-ridden neighborhoods. Angel finds a zombie statue and smashes it, returning all the zombie cops to their former dead, decaying states. Kate and Angel discuss the ambiguous ramifications of their victory for the neighborhood‚Äîalthough the killer zombies are gone, the criminals that they drove out are now free to return‚Äîand Kate confides in Angel that the job is making her crazy. While standing outside Wesley's hospital room as he recovers from his gunshot wound, Angel encounters Cordelia, who tells him he should just stay away from them.

Production In an essay examining the use of cinematic effects of time on Angel, Tammy Kinsey points out the cut sequence in this episode when Gunn pulls up to the shelter after Wesley has been shot. Although upon normal viewing it appears to simply be a few flashes of color, when played slowly it reveals itself as a shot of lightning over a field, a negative image of the scene itself, a flash of light, then a return to the positive image of the scene. The effect, Kinsey argues, is that the viewer experiences a \\"forced pause, not unlike the musical notation of a beat\\" which gives an unconscious impression of the following material.

Fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) is one of the most important conversion processes used in petroleum refineries. It is widely used to convert the high-boiling, high-molecular weight hydrocarbon fractions of petroleum crude oils into more valuable gasoline, olefinic gases, and other products. Cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons was originally done by thermal cracking, which has been almost completely replaced by catalytic cracking because it produces more gasoline with a higher octane rating. It also produces byproduct gases that have more carbon-carbon double bonds (i.e. more olefins), and hence more economic value, than those produced by thermal cracking. The feedstock to FCC is usually that portion of the crude oil that has an initial boiling point of or higher at atmospheric pressure and an average molecular weight ranging from about 200 to 600 or higher. This portion of crude oil is often referred to as heavy gas oil or vacuum gas oil (HVGO). In the FCC process, the feedstock is heated to a high temperature and moderate pressure, and brought into contact with a hot, powdered catalyst. The catalyst breaks the long-chain molecules of the high- boiling hydrocarbon liquids into much shorter molecules, which are collected as a vapor. Economics Oil refineries use fluid catalytic cracking to correct the imbalance between the market demand for gasoline and the excess of heavy, high boiling range products resulting from the distillation of crude oil. As of 2006, FCC units were in operation at 400 petroleum refineries worldwide and about one-third of the crude oil refined in those refineries is processed in an FCC to produce high-octane gasoline and fuel oils. During 2007, the FCC units in the United States processed a total of per day of feedstockU.S. Downstream Processing of Fresh Feed Input by Catalytic Cracking Units (Energy Information Administration, U.S. Dept. of Energy) and FCC units worldwide processed about twice that amount. FCC units are less common in EMEA because those regions have high demand for diesel and kerosene, which can be satisfied with hydrocracking. In the US, fluid catalytic cracking is more common because the demand for gasoline is higher. Flow diagram and process description The modern FCC units are all continuous processes which operate 24 hours a day for as long as 3 to 5 years between scheduled shutdowns for routine maintenance. There are several different proprietary designs that have been developed for modern FCC units. Each design is available under a license that must be purchased from the design developer by any petroleum refining company desiring to construct and operate an FCC of a given design. There are two different configurations for an FCC unit: the \\"stacked\\" type where the reactor and the catalyst regenerator are contained in two separate vessels, with the reactor above the regenerator, with a skirt between these vessels allowing the regenerator off-gas piping to connect to the top of the regenerator vessel, and the \\"side-by-side\\" type where the reactor and catalyst regenerator are in two separate vessels. The stacked configuration occupies less physical space of the refinery area. These are the major FCC designers and licensors: Side-by-side configuration: *CB&I; *ExxonMobil Research and Engineering (EMRE) *Shell Global Solutions *Axens / Stone & Webster Process Technology ‚Äî currently owned by Technip *Universal Oil Products (UOP) ‚Äî currently fully owned subsidiary of Honeywell Stacked configuration: *Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) Each of the proprietary design licensors claims to have unique features and advantages. A complete discussion of the relative advantages of each of the processes is beyond the scope of this article. =Reactor and Regenerator= The reactor and regenerator are considered to be the heart of the fluid catalytic cracking unit. The schematic flow diagram of a typical modern FCC unit in Figure 1 below is based upon the \\"side-by-side\\" configuration. The preheated high-boiling petroleum feedstock (at about 315 to 430 ¬∞C) consisting of long-chain hydrocarbon molecules is combined with recycle slurry oil from the bottom of the distillation column and injected into the catalyst riser where it is vaporised and cracked into smaller molecules of vapour by contact and mixing with the very hot powdered catalyst from the regenerator. All of the cracking reactions take place in the catalyst riser within a period of 2‚Äì4 seconds. The hydrocarbon vapours \\"fluidize\\" the powdered catalyst and the mixture of hydrocarbon vapors and catalyst flows upward to enter the reactor at a temperature of about 535 ¬∞C and a pressure of about 1.72 bar. The reactor is a vessel in which the cracked product vapors are: (a) separated from the spent catalyst by flowing through a set of two- stage cyclones within the reactor and (b) the spent catalyst flows downward through a steam stripping section to remove any hydrocarbon vapors before the spent catalyst returns to the catalyst regenerator. The flow of spent catalyst to the regenerator is regulated by a slide valve in the spent catalyst line. Since the cracking reactions produce some carbonaceous material (referred to as catalyst coke) that deposits on the catalyst and very quickly reduces the catalyst reactivity, the catalyst is regenerated by burning off the deposited coke with air blown into the regenerator. The regenerator operates at a temperature of about 715 ¬∞C and a pressure of about 2.41 bar, hence the regenerator operates at about 0.7 bar higher pressure than the reactor. The combustion of the coke is exothermic and it produces a large amount of heat that is partially absorbed by the regenerated catalyst and provides the heat required for the vaporization of the feedstock and the endothermic cracking reactions that take place in the catalyst riser. For that reason, FCC units are often referred to as being 'heat balanced'. The hot catalyst (at about 715 ¬∞C) leaving the regenerator flows into a catalyst withdrawal well where any entrained combustion flue gases are allowed to escape and flow back into the upper part to the regenerator. The flow of regenerated catalyst to the feedstock injection point below the catalyst riser is regulated by a slide valve in the regenerated catalyst line. The hot flue gas exits the regenerator after passing through multiple sets of two-stage cyclones that remove entrained catalyst from the flue gas. The amount of catalyst circulating between the regenerator and the reactor amounts to about 5 kg per kg of feedstock, which is equivalent to about 4.66 kg per litre of feedstock.Fluid Catalytic Cracking Thus, an FCC unit processing will circulate about 55,900 tonnes per day of catalyst. Figure 1: A schematic flow diagram of a Fluid Catalytic Cracking unit as used in petroleum refineries =Main column= The reaction product vapors (at 535 ¬∞C and a pressure of 1.72 bar) flow from the top of the reactor to the bottom section of the main column (commonly referred to as the main fractionator where feed splitting takes place) where they are distilled into the FCC end products of cracked petroleum naphtha, fuel oil, and offgas. After further processing for removal of sulfur compounds, the cracked naphtha becomes a high-octane component of the refinery's blended gasolines. The main fractionator offgas is sent to what is called a gas recovery unit where it is separated into butanes and butylenes, propane and propylene, and lower molecular weight gases (hydrogen, methane, ethylene and ethane). Some FCC gas recovery units may also separate out some of the ethane and ethylene. Although the schematic flow diagram above depicts the main fractionator as having only one sidecut stripper and one fuel oil product, many FCC main fractionators have two sidecut strippers and produce a light fuel oil and a heavy fuel oil. Likewise, many FCC main fractionators produce a light cracked naphtha and a heavy cracked naphtha. The terminology light and heavy in this context refers to the product boiling ranges, with light products having a lower boiling range than heavy products. The bottom product oil from the main fractionator contains residual catalyst particles which were not completely removed by the cyclones in the top of the reactor. For that reason, the bottom product oil is referred to as a slurry oil. Part of that slurry oil is recycled back into the main fractionator above the entry point of the hot reaction product vapors so as to cool and partially condense the reaction product vapors as they enter the main fractionator. The remainder of the slurry oil is pumped through a slurry settler. The bottom oil from the slurry settler contains most of the slurry oil catalyst particles and is recycled back into the catalyst riser by combining it with the FCC feedstock oil. The clarified slurry oil or decant oil is withdrawn from the top of slurry settler for use elsewhere in the refinery, as a heavy fuel oil blending component, or as carbon black feedstock. =Regenerator flue gas= Depending on the choice of FCC design, the combustion in the regenerator of the coke on the spent catalyst may or may not be complete combustion to carbon dioxide . The combustion air flow is controlled so as to provide the desired ratio of carbon monoxide (CO) to carbon dioxide for each specific FCC design. In the design shown in Figure 1, the coke has only been partially combusted to . The combustion flue gas (containing CO and ) at 715 ¬∞C and at a pressure of 2.41 bar is routed through a secondary catalyst separator containing swirl tubes designed to remove 70 to 90 percent of the particulates in the flue gas leaving the regenerator. This is required to prevent erosion damage to the blades in the turbo-expander that the flue gas is next routed through. The expansion of flue gas through a turbo-expander provides sufficient power to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor. The electrical motor- generator can consume or produce electrical power. If the expansion of the flue gas does not provide enough power to drive the air compressor, the electric motor/generator provides the needed additional power. If the flue gas expansion provides more power than needed to drive the air compressor, then the electric motor/generator converts the excess power into electric power and exports it to the refinery's electrical system. The expanded flue gas is then routed through a steam-generating boiler (referred to as a CO boiler) where the carbon monoxide in the flue gas is burned as fuel to provide steam for use in the refinery as well as to comply with any applicable environmental regulatory limits on carbon monoxide emissions. The flue gas is finally processed through an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) to remove residual particulate matter to comply with any applicable environmental regulations regarding particulate emissions. The ESP removes particulates in the size range of 2 to 20 ¬µm from the flue gas. Particulate filter systems, known as Fourth Stage Separators (FSS) are sometimes required to meet particulate emission limits. These can replace the ESP when particulate emissions are the only concern. The steam turbine in the flue gas processing system (shown in the above diagram) is used to drive the regenerator's combustion air compressor during start-ups of the FCC unit until there is sufficient combustion flue gas to take over that task. Feedstock Mechanism and products of catalytic cracking Figure 2: Diagrammatic example of the catalytic cracking of petroleum hydrocarbons The fluid catalytic cracking process breaks large hydrocarbons by their conversion to carbocations, which undergo myriad rearrangements. Figure 2 is a very simplified schematic diagram that exemplifies how the process breaks high boiling, straight-chain alkane (paraffin) hydrocarbons into smaller straight-chain alkanes as well as branched-chain alkanes, branched alkenes (olefins) and cycloalkanes (naphthenes). The breaking of the large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller molecules is more technically referred to by organic chemists as scission of the carbon-to-carbon bonds. As depicted in Figure 2, some of the smaller alkanes are then broken and converted into even smaller alkenes and branched alkenes such as the gases ethylene, propylene, butylenes, and isobutylenes. Those olefinic gases are valuable for use as petrochemical feedstocks. The propylene, butylene and isobutylene are also valuable feedstocks for certain petroleum refining processes that convert them into high-octane gasoline blending components. As also depicted in Figure 2, the cycloalkanes (naphthenes) formed by the initial breakup of the large molecules are further converted to aromatics such as benzene, toluene, and xylenes, which boil in the gasoline boiling range and have much higher octane ratings than alkanes. In the cracking process carbon is also produced which gets deposited on the catalyst (catalyst coke). The carbon formation tendency or amount of carbon in a crude or FCC feed is measured with methods such as Micro Carbon Residue, Conradson Carbon Residue, or Ramsbottom Carbon Residue. =Catalysts= Modern FCC catalysts are fine powders with a bulk density of 0.80 to 0.96 g/cm3 and having a particle size distribution ranging from 10 to 150 ¬µm and an average particle size of 60 to 100 Œºm. The design and operation of an FCC unit is largely dependent upon the chemical and physical properties of the catalyst. The desirable properties of an FCC catalyst are: * Good stability to high temperature and to steam * High activity * Large pore sizes * Good resistance to attrition * Low coke production Structure of aluminosilicate cage in faujasite. Vertices are occupied by aluminium or silicon, the connecting struts are occupied by oxide (O2-) or hydroxide (OH‚àí) centers. Special modifications of faujesite are strong solid acids, which at high temperatures induce the rearrangements of C-C bonds that occur in FCC units. A modern FCC catalyst has four major components: crystalline zeolite, matrix, binder, and filler. Zeolite is the active component and can comprise from about 15 to 50 weight percent of the catalyst. Faujasite (aka Type Y) is the zeolite used in FCC units. The zeolite are strong solid acids (equivalent to 90% sulfuric acid). The alumina matrix component of an FCC catalyst also contributes to catalytic activity sites. The binder and filler components provide the physical strength and integrity of the catalyst. The binder is usually silica sol and the filler is usually a clay (kaolin). The major suppliers of FCC catalysts worldwide include Albemarle Corporation, W.R. Grace Company, and BASF Catalysts (formerly Engelhard). The price for lanthanum oxide used in fluid catalytic cracking has risen from $5 per kilogram in early 2010 to $140 per kilogram in June 2011.Chu, Steven. Critical Materials Strategy page 17 United States Department of Energy, December 2011. Accessed: 23 December 2011. FCC units continuously withdraw and replace some of the catalyst in order to maintain a steady level of activity. History The first commercial use of catalytic cracking occurred in 1915 when Almer M. McAfee of Gulf Refining Company developed a batch process using aluminum chloride (a Friedel Crafts catalyst known since 1877) to catalytically crack heavy petroleum oils. However, the prohibitive cost of the catalyst prevented the widespread use of McAfee's process at that time.Pioneer of Catalytic Cracking: Almer McAfee at Gulf Oil (North American Catalysis Society website) In 1922, a French mechanical engineer named Eugene Jules Houdry and a French pharmacist named E.A. Prudhomme set up a laboratory near Paris to develop a catalytic process for converting lignite coal to gasoline. Supported by the French government, they built a small demonstration plant in 1929 that processed about 60 tons per day of lignite coal. The results indicated that the process was not economically viable and it was subsequently shut down. Houdry had found that Fuller's earth, a clay mineral containing aluminosilicates, could convert oil derived from the lignite to gasoline. He then began to study the catalysis of petroleum oils and had some success in converting vaporized petroleum oil to gasoline. In 1930, the Vacuum Oil Company invited him to come to the United States and he moved his laboratory to Paulsboro, New Jersey. In 1931, the Vacuum Oil Company merged with Standard Oil of New York (Socony) to form the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. In 1933, a small Houdry unit processed of petroleum oil. Because of the economic depression of the early 1930s, Socony-Vacuum was no longer able to support Houdry's work and gave him permission to seek help elsewhere. In 1933, Houdry and Socony-Vacuum joined with Sun Oil Company in developing the Houdry process. Three years later, in 1936, Socony-Vacuum converted an older thermal cracking unit in their Paulsboro refinery in New Jersey to a small demonstration unit using the Houdry process to catalytically crack of petroleum oil. In 1937, Sun Oil began operation of a new Houdry unit processing in their Marcus Hook refinery in Pennsylvania. The Houdry process at that time used reactors with a fixed bed of catalyst and was a semi-batch operation involving multiple reactors with some of the reactors in operation while other reactors were in various stages of regenerating the catalyst. Motor-driven valves were used to switch the reactors between online operation and offline regeneration and a cycle timer managed the switching. Almost 50 percent of the cracked product was gasoline as compared with about 25 percent from the thermal cracking processes. By 1938, when the Houdry process was publicly announced, Socony-Vacuum had eight additional units under construction. Licensing the process to other companies also began and by 1940 there were 14 Houdry units in operation processing . The next major step was to develop a continuous process rather than the semi-batch Houdry process. That step was implemented by advent of the moving-bed process known as the Thermofor Catalytic Cracking (TCC) process which used a bucket conveyor- elevator to move the catalyst from the regeneration kiln to the separate reactor section. A small semicommercial demonstration TCC unit was built in Socony-Vacuum's Paulsboro refinery in 1941 and operated successfully, producing . Then a full-scale commercial TCC unit processing began operation in 1943 at the Beaumont, Texas refinery of Magnolia Oil Company, an affiliate of Socony-Vacuum. By the end of World War II in 1945, the processing capacity of the TCC units in operation was about . It is said that the Houdry and TCC units were a major factor in the winning of World War II by supplying the high-octane gasoline needed by the air forces of Great Britain and the United States for the more efficient higher compression ratio engines of the Spitfire and the Mustang. In the years immediately after World War II, the Houdriflow process and the air-lift TCC process were developed as improved variations on the moving-bed theme. Just like Houdry's fixed-bed reactors, the moving-bed designs were prime examples of good engineering by developing a method of continuously moving the catalyst between the reactor and regeneration sections. The first air-lift TCC unit began operation in October 1950 at the Beaumont, Texas refinery. This fluid catalytic cracking process had first been investigated in the 1920s by Standard Oil of New Jersey, but research on it was abandoned during the economic depression years of 1929 to 1939. In 1938, when the success of Houdry's process had become apparent, Standard Oil of New Jersey resumed the project as part of a consortium of that include five oil companies (Standard Oil of New Jersey, Standard Oil of Indiana, Anglo-Iranian Oil, Texas Oil and Dutch Shell), two engineering-construction companies (M.W. Kellogg Limited and Universal Oil Products) and a German chemical company (I.G. Farben). The consortium was called Catalytic Research Associates (CRA) and its purpose was to develop a catalytic cracking process which would not impinge on Houdry's patents. Chemical engineering professors Warren K. Lewis and Edwin R. Gilliland of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggested to the CRA researchers that a low velocity gas flow through a powder might \\"lift\\" it enough to cause it to flow in a manner similar to a liquid. Focused on that idea of a fluidized catalyst, researchers Donald Campbell, Homer Martin, Eger Murphree and Charles Tyson of the Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon-Mobil Company) developed the first fluidized catalytic cracking unit. Their U.S. Patent No. 2,451,804, A Method of and Apparatus for Contacting Solids and Gases, describes their milestone invention. Based on their work, M. W. Kellogg Company constructed a large pilot plant in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana refinery of the Standard Oil of New Jersey. The pilot plant began operation in May 1940. Based on the success of the pilot plant, the first commercial fluid catalytic cracking plant (known as the Model I FCC) began processing of petroleum oil in the Baton Rouge refinery on May 25, 1942, just four years after the CRA consortium was formed and in the midst of World War II. A little more than a month later, in July 1942, it was processing . In 1963, that first Model I FCC unit was shut down after 21 years of operation and subsequently dismantled.Eger Murphree and the Four Horsemen: FCC, Fluid Catalytic Cracking (North American Catalysis Society website) In the many decades since the Model I FCC unit began operation, the fixed bed Houdry units have all been shut down as have most of the moving bed units (such as the TCC units) while hundreds of FCC units have been built. During those decades, many improved FCC designs have evolved and cracking catalysts have been greatly improved, but the modern FCC units are essentially the same as that first Model I FCC unit.

West River is the portion of the state of South Dakota located west of the Missouri River with well over one-half of the land area and between one-quarter and one-third of the population of the state. The contrast between the two regions is striking. While East River is predominantly a corn- and wheat-growing region, with large numbers of pigs and poultry operations, West River is predominantly ranching with some dryland farming. Population has decreased as family farms declined due to the harsh conditions and industrialization of agriculture. Other than aggregates, all mining in South Dakota (including gold and other precious metals, industrial minerals, iron ore, and coal) is located in West River, which includes the Black Hills. Both areas were occupied for thousands of years by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. The historical Great Plains tribes, especially the Lakota or Sioux groups, held most of the territory west of the river. Moreover, the Badlands are located here, a vast expanse of rugged, unusable land designated a national park in 1939. Badlands in Jackson County, South Dakota While European-American settlement of East River was largely by homesteaders moving west from Iowa and Minnesota, or immigrants arriving by train from eastern US seaports, those who went to West River were first gold- seekers and miners; many from older gold rush locations to the west, such as Montana and Colorado. They were followed by ranchers from Texas, Kansas, and Colorado. As a result, while East River has a high Scandinavian and German- descended population and a culture similar that of Minnesota, the majority population of West River is more generally European American, with a culture similar to the Mountain states. Nearly 10% of South Dakota's total population is Native AmericanSouth Dakota QuickFacts from the US Census Bureau and Indian reservations are located in both sides of the state. Five are located west of the Missouri River, the area of the former Great Sioux Reservation established in 1868. More than 30% of the population of West River is of Native American descent; this includes primarily Lakota residents of the reservations, as well as populations in urban centers such as Rapid City. Since the 1960s and the rise of Indian activism, numerous Native Americans have returned to the reservations. Native Americans make up the fastest-growing segment of the population in the state as a whole.Herbert T. Hoover, \\"South Dakota: Modern Indian Tribes\\", The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia], edited by Andrew R. L. Cayton, Richard Sisson, Chris Zacher, Indiana University Press, 2006, p. 50 In the 1990s, Bennett County's population became majority Native American. From 2000 to 2010, the total Native American population in the state grew by 15 percent.Mary Garrigan, \\"State's Native American population grows 15 percent\\", Rapid City Journal, 17 February 2011; accessed 16 August 2016 Since the late 20th century, Native Americans have become more engaged in local, state and federal politics.

Written by Tim Minear and directed by James Whitmore, Jr., it was originally broadcast on February 20, 2001 on the WB network. In this episode, Angel learns that during the impending Wolfram & Hart 75-Year Review, the firm is visited by one of the demonic Senior Partners. The demon wears a ring with the power to transport to the firm‚Äôs hellish Home Office, which Angel steals with the aid of a magically protective glove. When Angel travels to the Home Office, he learns it is on Earth, and depressed, seeks solace in Darla's arms. Meanwhile, Kate's life falls apart when she is fired from the police force. Plot Angel prevents a sacrificial ritual from being performed by two Wolfram & Hart employees, who are nervous about something called \\"the Review\\". He asks Kate for information about the Review, but Kate - under investigation due to her involvement with odd cases - bitterly refuses, showing him crime scene photos from Holland Manners' wine cellar illustrating his involvement in the slaughter. Angel turns to Lorne, who is having a busy night as Caritas is full of Wolfram & Hart lawyers wanting to have their destinies read. Lorne tells Angel that a Wolfram & Hart Senior Partner (manifesting in the form of a lower demon) is coming to earth for the historically deadly Review, and that the sacrifices and rituals are simply the lawyers trying to get brownie points with the Senior Partner before he shows up. Lorne also tells Angel that anything that can manifest itself in our dimension can be killed and that something called the Band of Blacknil is important. Angel goes to leave but Lorne stops him and tells him one last thing... that pretty much every lawyer in the club really wants to see him dead, but you don't need to be a psychic to know that, given that everyone in the club is giving Angel hostile stares. Meanwhile, at Angel Investigations, the team have successfully removed the third eye from the back of Stephanie Sharp's head. However Mrs. Sharp tells the gang that she has no intention of paying the bill and that as far as she is concerned Angel Investigations are running a scam since it is 'impossible' for a third eye to grow out the back of a skull, despite the fact that it was she who approached them with the problem. She and her daughter leave having successfully stiffed the gang for payment and an exasperated Gunn leaves. Lindsey finds Darla waiting for him at home and she weakly tells him that Drusilla is not returning to L.A.. He gives her a container of human blood; she stops feigning weakness and searches his briefcase while he is in the shower. Meanwhile, at the hotel Angel attempts to look up the Band of Blacknil but doesn't have much research material given that it all left along with Wesley. Angel then shows up at the office of his former employees uninvited and unwelcome, barely acknowledges his former friends and helps himself to a book. Cordelia refuses to let him take it and grabs it off him, but Angel grows cold and deadly and it is clear he is willing to use force to get the book back. Wesley rises from his wheelchair and tells Cordy to let Angel have the book so he can remove himself from the premises. She finally gives him the book and Angel leaves without a second thought. Cordelia vents about Angel until Wesley catches her attention: stitches from his healing gunshot wound have torn in the confrontation. Angel returns to the bookstore he visited fifty years ago in search of information on the Senior Partner. A decades-older Denver tells Angel that it wears a ring that allows passage to Hell. To take the ring, Angel needs a one-of-a-kind magic glove that would allow him to strangle the Senior Partner without being incinerated. Denver gets the glove from the back room, but before he can give it to Angel, Darla stabs him with a sword and takes the glove. Facing a review board during an Internal Affairs investigation, Kate is unceremoniously fired. She self-destructively deals with her dismissal by drinking and knocking her accolades to the floor, pausing to cry at a picture of her father. Virginia talks with Wesley about how much danger he's always in. With heartbreaking insight, Wesley acknowledges how difficult it must be for her - to break up with him. Wesley and Cordelia talk on the phone, both depressed about their lives and lack of work. Wesley tells Cordy that things are going to get better, but it is clear neither believes it. Cordelia gets a call from Mrs. Sharp, claiming to have changed her mind and offering to pay; what Cordelia doesn't know is that Mrs. Sharp was threatened into calling by a demon that kills her after she tells him Cordelia is on her way. Angel arrives at the Review, and when he spots Darla in the crowd the two fight while the Senior Partner materializes. Security guards attack Darla after Angel exposes her as a vampire by dousing her with holy water. In the confusion, Angel gets the glove away from Darla, dons it and flies at the Senior Partner's throat. The Senior Partner implodes, but the force of Angel's leap carries him crashing out the window. When he hits the ground, Angel puts on the ring, causing elevator doors to open in the foundation of the Wolfram & Hart building. Holland (whose contract extends well beyond death) offers Angel a one-way trip down to the \\"Home Office,\\" which Angel assumes is Hell. After passing through nether realms of darkness and fire, the elevator comes to a stop and its doors open - right back where they started. The \\"Home Office\\" is Earth, the implication being that Angel can never rescue humanity because humanity is its own worst enemy. Angel walks away, witnessing the despair around him. Returning to the hotel, he hangs up on a message from Kate, who is drunk and overdosing on pills. Angel finds Darla waiting for him and, realizing that he wants to feel something, anything, Angel kisses her. At first, she pushes him away, but he takes her roughly and soon the two are having sex. Later, as a storm crashes outside, Angel wakes with a gasp. Production The Wolfram & Hart exterior is an office building in downtown Culver City, located across the street from the main Sony Studios lot. =Acting= One of the people sacrificing goats at the beginning of the episode is writer/producer David Fury, who later has a larger acting role in the fifth season episode \\"Smile Time\\". =Writing= In her essay entitled \\"Why We Love Lindsey,\\" M.S.

Despairing, Angel edges closer to his Angelus side, which is explicitly noted by Cordelia in this episode after Angel threatens her over a book: \\"I don't even know what you are anymore.\\" He continues to search for meaning by deciding to destroy Wolfram & Hart - he tells Lorne, \\"Getting to these Senior Partners... that's my destiny\\" - but once again loses meaning after being shown that hell is on Earth, which causes him to reach the peak of his existential misery. In this episode, Angel's metaphorical descent becomes a literal one, via the elevator to the Home Office. *Angel kills one of Wolfram & Hart's Senior Partners. *Angel learns that Wolfram & Hart's Home Office, the hell from which the Senior Partners supposedly come, is actually everyday life on Earth. *Kate is fired from the LAPD, and apparently attempts suicide with booze and pills. *Wesley and Virginia end their relationship.

Written by Tim Minear and directed by Thomas J. Wright, it was originally broadcast on February 27, 2001 on the WB network. After spending an evening of empty passion with Darla, despite knowing that any moment of true happiness will make him lose his soul, Angel wakes up with his soul intact and realizes that being evil to combat evil is not all it‚Äôs cracked up to be. Now, Angel needs to regain the trust of Wesley, Cordelia and Gunn who have been taken hostage by a group of murderous, revenge-seeking Skilosh demons who are looking for human hosts to spread their kin. Meanwhile, a jealous Lindsey learns that Darla has had sex with Angel, and goes looking to kill Angel himself. Also, Kate recovers and sees a new light to her life after Angel saves her from a suicide attempt. Plot Angel pulls on some clothes and struggles to the balcony, falling to his knees in pain as Darla looks on, waiting for him to become Angelus. Angel apologizes for not being able to save her, revealing that he never lost his soul: instead of experiencing the \\"perfect happiness\\" that would release it, he realizes his surrender to her was instead an act of perfect despair. Darla can't accept that she failed in ridding him of his soul, but the sex has reawakened the good in Angel, making him realize his recent mistakes. Darla is devastated that she wasn't able to reawaken Angelus, and her words remind him of Kate's phone message. Angel throws Darla out telling her he'll be forced to kill her if he sees her again, and then rushes over to Kate's place and revives her from her drug and alcohol induced unconsciousness. Lindsey returns to his apartment to find Darla who tells him of her night with Angel. Angel shows up at the bar after hours and wakes the Host for advice. He's confused about his future and the Host warns him that his friends are in danger. Cordelia arrives at the Sharp home, finding all of the family dead. She receives a vision about a demon attacking her, only to have it occur moments later. Cordelia realizes that the demons have an eye on the back of their heads and they want her friends destroyed in retaliation for destroying their spawn in Stephanie Sharp. Wesley hears noises in his apartment and just before one of the Skilosh demons attacks, Angel arrives. The two manage to destroy the demons and both share a brief moment of camaraderie before the walls go up again. Angel tries to explain his return to helping his friends. Wesley tells everything he knows about the demons, their reproduction through human hosts, and the destruction of the demon in Stephanie. The Skilosh demons, upset about losing two more of their kind, use Cordelia as bait to bring new hosts. Arriving at Angel Investigations, Angel and Wesley are dismayed to find Cordelia missing. Angel suggests Cordelia has gone out partying, but Wesley tells Angel harshly that Cordelia is not the same woman she was, the visions have turned her into a solitary person, a far cry from the carefree girl she used to be, and that while Angel was more than happy to turn his back on the visions, that's not a luxury Cordelia has. Angel is left feeling ashamed, and this deepens his resolve to her save her, something Wesley does agree with. Hearing a noise outside, the two arm themselves, but find it only to be Gunn checking out why the lights are on. Angel notes the strong bond that's developed between Wesley and Gunn. Setting off for the Sharp residence, Angel volunteers to take care of some Skilosh demons waiting for them telling the others that Cordelia is the only thing that matters. As Angel's about to start fighting with the demons they suddenly flee. Angel is confused, until Lindsey drives a truck full-speed down the street, repeatedly running Angel down. Lindsey beats Angel with a sledgehammer, demanding to know what happened with Darla. Angel turns the tables on Lindsey, and starts to beat him all the while apologizing that Darla will never love him and that he didn't try harder to save Lindsey when he came to him for help. In the end he smashes Lindsey's prosthetic hand with the sledgehammer and steals Lindsey's truck, telling the lawyer that he could have smashed the other hand if it wasn't for the epiphany. Gunn and Wesley try to sneak into the Sharp home but are caught. Angel crashes Lindsey's truck through the Sharp house, rescuing his friends, but he's hurt emotionally when they aren't willing to accept him back into the fold. After finding his damaged truck returned by Angel, Lindsey discovers that Darla has moved out of his apartment and has left L.A.. Angel talks with Kate about his new look on life; how he's realized that he should help people for the sake of helping them instead of for his own redemption and that if there is no bigger meaning then the small acts of kindness are the greatest things in the world. Kate says a higher power must be watching over them, because she never invited him into her home but he was able to enter regardless and save her life. Angel appears at the Angel Investigations office and apologizes to his friends. Wesley tells Angel that the three of them have talked and have decided they're not ready to return to working for him, however Angel responds that he doesn't want them to work for him - he wants to work for them, and accepts that he will have to work hard to regain their trust. A vision from Cordelia puts their doubts on the back burner and the reunited team head out to help the helpless.

However, as it becomes clear that Angel's soul is intact, he rushes to save Kate in a blur of quickly cut scenes.

History Pinelands Regional High School officially opened on September 5, 1979, as a Junior-Senior High School, originally housing students in seventh through twelfth grades from Tuckerton, Little Egg Harbor, Bass River, and Eagleswood. Prior to the opening of the school, students from those communities had attended Southern Regional School District in the Manahawkin section of Stafford Township, which had been dealing for years with overcrowding.The History of SRHS, Southern Regional School District. Accessed January 22, 2020. \\"But eventually the high school had to go into split sessions due to over-crowding again. That problem was finally solved in 1979 with the opening of Pinelands Regional High School in Tuckerton. All mainland students south of Manahawkin would no longer be attending Southern Regional.\\" The building originally held grades 7-8 on the third floor, 9-10 on the second, and 11-12 on the first. The building featured an experimental \\"open classroom\\" design, where a large group of students of varying skill levels would be in a single, large classroom with several teachers overseeing them; and contained no interior walls. However, this format didn't last long, and in the 1980s, the rooms were walled off and separated by floor-to-ceiling folding partitions. In 1991, Pinelands Middle School opened across the street for students in grades 7-8. Also in the 1990s, a new building was completed next to the high school, which houses a daycare center called \\"Rainbow Express\\". Students taking childcare classes attend class in this building to help with the daycare kids. In 2002, the Middle School was expanded and the 9th grade was moved there. When the expansion was completed at the Middle School, it was renamed \\"Pinelands Regional Junior High School\\" while the high school was formally renamed the \\"Senior High School\\". In 2017, voters approved a bond referendum for renovations to both schools, including new roofing, bathrooms, new masonry in the High School building, and other cosmetic and safety upgrades. Renovation work on the High School was halted after workers discovered asbestos and roofing nails dislodged in the commons area. The high school building was closed for the entirety of the 2018-2019 school year while renovations were completed; portable classrooms were installed at the junior high school to accommodate five grades of students, while 7th graders attended the nearby Frog Pond Elementary School.Lowe, Claire. \\"Construction to close Pinelands Regional High School for 2018-19 school year\\", The Press of Atlantic City, March 21, 2018.

Plot synopsis The Angel Investigations team celebrates at an expensive restaurant for Cordelia's role in a national commercial. Cordelia expresses her worries about leaving the team temporarily while Wesley and Gunn are sure they can handle things while she's working on her career. Angel continues to feel left out of the group and worries about the prices of their meals. Angel attacks a woman wearing a shawl that he mistakes as a witch's garb, making an unnecessary scene. Moments later, Cordelia discovers that the food is not all that great as she throws it up on the floor of the restaurant. The next day, Wesley speaks with his parents on the phone. After wishing his father a happy birthday, his spirits are lowered, as his father puts down everything Wesley tells him. Angel makes an appearance at the set where Cordelia's commercial is being shot, enjoying the fake sunlight effect of the beach scene. When Cordelia comes up to him and asks him why he is there, Angel starts to question her about the Haklar demon she saw in her vision, but they are interrupted by the arrival of Seth, the commercial director. As Angel watches, Seth, who appears to be deeply frustrated, becomes irritated at Cordelia when he has to ask her twice to see her bikini costume, and after studying her, notices that there are circles under her eyes from where she had suffered from food poisoning the previous night and asks his assistant when she is scheduled to go to the makeup department, only for Cordelia to tell him she has already been. Irate at their incompetence, Seth tells his assistant to take her back and then, in anger, makes some flippant, rude comments about her appearance, diet, and desirability. Angel is furious and, after confronting Seth, threatening him with his body language and coming very close to attacking him, asks Cordelia if she wants him to rip Seth's head off for offending her, but she just wants him to leave and stop damaging her career. Gunn's friends, George and Rondell, arrive at the hotel, requesting Gunn's assistance with a vampire problem. Gunn is more than willing to help, but Angel returns with news on the Haklar demon they're tracking and Gunn's friends are put on hold. Angel expresses his worry for Cordelia to Wesley and Gunn, telling them about the way she had endured the bullish, surly, combustible, abrasive, boorish Seth's derogatory treatment of her, and wondering why she would want to work in an environment with someone who would treat her so badly. At Caritas, an ugly gray demon enters through a portal that opened up in the club. Angel and Wesley return to the hotel after killing the Haklar demon to find Cordelia in the aftermath of her embarrassing job experience. Out of frustration during an argument with her after she messed up at one point during the shooting of the commercial, an exasperated Seth had made it clear that she was really just there for visual purposes, not her acting abilities. The Host visits the hotel, requesting the aid of Angel Investigations to kill the Drokken demon that arrived unexpectedly at Caritas. He stresses the importance of killing the demon, as it is a man-eating demon and probably very hungry. Cordelia gets a vision about a woman in a library and a portal opening up behind her. Gunn returns to the hideout of his gang only to find that George has been bitten and they don't know if he'll be coming back undead or not. At the library, a description of the woman and pendant Cordelia saw in her vision is given to a woman there. The woman recognizes it, but says that its owner, a woman named Fred (short for Winifred), has been missing for five years. While investigating the area where Fred disappeared, Cordelia finds a book in an odd language and reads some of it aloud. The Host is worried as she sounds out the text and he tries to say something a few times, but doesn't. Another portal appears in the library and a large green demon, similar to the Host appears. The Host recognizes the demon as Landok, but he isn't excited about it in the least. Landok identifies the Host as Krevlornswath of the Deathwok Clan and the Host admits that the two demons are cousins. Landok questions the Host's disappearance from their home dimension, but the Host has no interest in returning. The Drokken demon becomes the focus again as Landok offers his help and expertise on tracking it and killing it. On the streets, Gunn confronts Rondell about waiting for him, but Rondell makes it clear that they've been waiting for him for far too long. While searching for the Drokken, the Host tells Angel about his homeland, painting a very interesting picture. With the help of Landok, the gang is able to locate the Drokken and Angel and Landok go after it. The demon has a woman he's holding for food, and the gang must save. Landok is fatally bitten, the bite being venomous to his kind. A big fight ensues with the demon as it runs off after the woman. Wesley and Angel battle as best they can against the demon and Angel finally kills it by throwing a sword through its throat. Outside, Cordelia reveals that they can get Landok back home for a cure by reading from the book. She's not sure how she's positive about it, but she is. Gunn and Rondell burn George's body on top of a stack of wood, sad for the loss of their friend. At Caritas, Landok reads from the book and after a portal opens and closes, Landok is gone. As the gang muse over the latest adventure, they find that Cordelia has vanished. Cordelia wakes up in unfamiliar territory, realizing she's in a whole new world.

This episode begins immediately where the previous ends: Cordelia has been inadvertently sucked into a dimensional portal. She ends up as a slave in an alternate world called Pylea, until her owners learn of her precognitive visions. Back in Los Angeles, Angel, Wesley and the Host attempt to rescue Cordelia, while Gunn discovers he has alienated his old street gang. Plot The group realizes Cordelia has been sucked into Lorne's home dimension of Pylea, which Lorne says he was glad to leave. Caritas, the bar he runs, was once the abandoned building where the portal from Pylea opened up. Angel reads from the book to reopen the portal, but it fails to open; Wesley's researching discovers that the portal can only open in hot spots and Caritas is currently cold. Lorne seeks help from a psychic friend in order to find a hot spot, but she won't provide the information until he agrees to go with the others to finish his business in Pylea. Two lawyers from Wolfram & Hart appear at Angel's hotel, informing Angel that the law firm plans to buy the hotel when the current lease expires. Angel vamps out and lawyers take their leave, but not before threatening to make Angel's life difficult. Angel leaves a message on an answering machine with information about saving the hotel in case they don't make it back from Pylea. Cordelia finds herself in a new dimension, where she is chased down and captured by a demon who declares her a \\"cow\\", or human slave. Her demon owner forces her into a collar that can be used to shock her when she doesn't obey. As she later mucks out the stables, wondering aloud if she can remove the collar, a runaway slave warns her through a hole in a wall that she shouldn't bother fighting. Cordelia is unable to see that the woman is Fred from her vision, crazy after all her years in Pylea. Before any more information can be exchanged, Fred is caught and taken away. Later, Cordelia follows her owner, carrying purchases from the market, until a vision causes her to fall and drop everything. She reveals she saw a villager being attacked by a Drokken in her vision, and a crowd draws, declaring her cursed. Cordelia is brought before Constable Narwek and explains she has precognitive visions. Angel pulls his car up to the gate of a movie studio lot, following Lorne's information that it is a psychic hot spot. Although Gunn had earlier stated that George's death made him realize he's needed in this dimension, Angel's depressing phone message persuades him to join the mission. Wesley reads from the book, and with final good-byes to L.A., Angel drives his car through the portal. The book falls onto the sidewalk as the car vanishes. As the car arrives in daytime Pylea, Angel rushes to cover himself before realizing the two suns are not fatal to vampires. Happy and amazed, Angel goes off to gather branches to hide the car while enjoying the rare opportunity to be in sunlight. After covering the car, the guys realize that the book is gone and that they'll have to find another way to get back home. In town, Lorne advises that they stay to the shadows, as humans are treated as slaves. The Host tries to get help from an old friend but is met with bad reception. Chased by villagers, the gang is eventually caught and tied up in the middle of town. After the Constable arrives, Lorne is taken away for questioning while the rest are chained in a dungeon until they are sentenced. In the dungeon, the guys brainstorm for escape plans and then with his vampire hearing, Angel overhears a conversation about Cordelia and her \\"sight.\\" Guards bring Angel, Gunn, and Wesley to the Constable, who announces they will all be killed. For their death sentence, they are brought before the Princess of Pylea...Cordelia. Production details Production designer Stuart Blatt says the Angel location department had found a movie ranch with a standing set for a \\"Tijuana town,\\" which they dressed for the Boxer Rebellion scenes of \\"Darla\\" and used again for the village of Pylea. He says, \\"it just so happens that the Chinese province town which looked a lot like Mexico also happens to look a lot like England, or Pylea or any other medieval pseudo Euro-space, alternative dimension with two suns kind of world\\". The set designers added timbers to the existing clay buildings, put thatching on the roofs, and created stalls for merchants and vendors. Blatt says their animal wranglers brought in \\"medieval chickens and goats and pigs and yaks\\" and old chariots were reconstructed to create the vehicles. The scene in which Angel opens the portal to Pylea was shot outside Paramount Pictures, where the series is filmed. =Alternate version= The opening scene for this episode is missing on the Region 1 DVD release: The \\"Previously On Angel\\" segment led directly into the teaser for this episode, and featured Angel, Wesley and The Host surprised to find Cordelia has vanished into the portal with Landok. They immediately begin searching for her, and the scene cuts to Cordelia's current location on Pylea. This scene is missing because the Region 1 DVD release of season 2 does not feature any of the \\"Previously On Angel\\" segments, but the scene and segments are intact on the Region 2 and Region 4 DVD releases. =Writing= Despite fan speculation that the Pylea episodes were due to Julie Benz being unavailable for the conclusion of the Darla storyline, writer Tim Minear says the writers decided they were \\"weary of the Darla drama\\" and wanted the finale to be something \\"totally unexpected\\" instead. Julie Benz confirmed that she left because the writers had \\"played out the storyline as much as possible.\\" =Acting= This episode is the first appearance of eventual Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim as Gavin Park, who became a recurring character in the third and fourth seasons. =Cultural references= * Over the Rainbow: The episode's title is a reference to the famous song written for The Wizard of Oz. * After arriving in Pylea, Cordelia taps the heels of her shoes together three times, which is what Dorothy did when she was sent home, in the movie, The Wizard of Oz *Among the things he lists as things he'd rather have to do instead of return to his home dimension, Lorne says \\"I'd rather sit through a junior high school production of Cats.\\" Lorne's dislike for the works of Andrew Lloyd Webber was made known in Reprise. Reception and reviews The \\"Pylea\\" arc, which begins with this episode and concludes with the season finale, \\"There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb\\", appears ninth on Slayage.com's list of the top 10 episodes of Angel. Charisma Carpenter was praised for demonstrating \\"true strength as a comedic actress.\\" However, UGO Networks felt that the episodes were \\"something of a disappointment\\" because the \\"Dungeons & Dragons style world\\" of Pylea broke the dark tone that had been established.

Written and directed by Tim Minear, it was originally broadcast on May 15, 2001 on the WB network. It is the second episode in a three-part arc. In \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", Angel and the others are still trapped in the Pylea dimension. Cordelia finds herself appointed ruling princess of Pylea by an order of priests and ordered to mate with a human-like creature called the Groosalugg, while Angel seeks to help Lorne the Host bond with his estranged family, which takes a turn when Angel saves a runaway human slave, named Winifred \\"Fred\\" Burkle, the same L.A. librarian who was sucked into Pylea five years earlier. Also, Wesley and Gunn manage to escape from the castle only to end up as captives of human Pylean rebels plotting to overthrow the monarchy. Plot Angel, Wesley, and Gunn are shocked to see Cordelia has been crowned princess of Pylea. She jokingly demands their heads be cut off, but quickly restates herself. After she dismisses the guards, Cordelia recounts how she became princess due to her visions. Lorne confirms his people have been waiting for one cursed with the sight that will save them all. Lorne takes Angel to his family's house, where Lorne's cousin Landok identifies Angel as a hero. Angel, who is made the special guest of their upcoming village feast, tells stories to the people of Pylea while Lorne is ignored. Landok offers Angel the honor of \\"swinging the crebbil in the Bach-nal,\\" and Angel agrees to take part - before he learns it means beheading a human so the people of Pylea can feast on it. Winifred ‚ÄúFred‚Äù Burkle is brought forth, but Angel refuses to kill her. The two are able to make an escape when Lorne begins to sing, causing severe pain to the Pyleans. While perusing the castle library, Wesley discovers \\"the cursed one\\" will have to perform something called a \\"com-shuk\\" with a Groosalugg. He considers asking the priests to translate the book, until he realizes it is part of a trilogy marked with three animals - wolf, ram and hart - linking the priests to the evil law firm back in Los Angeles. Silas, one of the priests, arrives to inform Cordelia that the Groosalugg has been summoned and that the \\"com-shuk\\" is a mating ritual. Wesley, Gunn, and Cordelia try to escape through a sewer tunnel, but Cordelia is caught by the priests and dragged back to her throne. Heavily guarded, Cordelia worries about mating with the demon, until Silas introduces the Groosalugg, who is a handsome and muscular young male. Fred leads Angel to a cave where she has been staying for a long while. Fred talks nervously as she crazily scribbles on the cave walls. Angel finds Fred's driver's license and realizes she is the girl from Cordy's vision. She doesn't believe him when he tells her of her life in LA and how she got to Pylea because it's been so long, she's doesn't want to believe. Angel is attacked by guards as he tries to lead Fred to the castle, and when he tries to shift into his vampire face, instead he becomes pure demon and brutally rips through the guard's body with his super-sized teeth. The other runs and Angel takes off as well, leaving Fred frightened and alone. Wesley and Gunn wander lost, until the demon Angel attacks them. It takes a while before Wesley can recognize Angel's tattoo. A short distance away, Fred coats her hand in blood and is able to lure Angel away from his friends with the smell. Demon Angel sees his reflection in water at Fred's cave and is suddenly motivated to switch back to human form. Gunn and Wesley are surrounded and tied up by rebels who want to send a message to the castle. Gunn and Wesley try to convince the rebels that they know the princess and suggest they use them to contact her. The rebels agree, but their idea involves decapitation. Fred comforts Angel as he painfully deals with the aftermath of being controlled by the demon inside of him. He concludes that his friends saw what he really was and now he can never go back to them. The Groosalugg tells Cordelia that his human qualities make him unappealing to his people, so he battled with demons to end his existence, but after defeating them earned the name for bravery and strength. Lorne is brought before Cordelia for judgment and he is almost sentenced to death, but Cordelia pardons him and then kicks him out so she can be alone with her future mate. Cordelia explains to the Groosalugg that she is not a princess, but he doesn't believe her because of what he was told. Silas tells his fellow priests that the princess has requested paper so she can write proclamations and do good for Pylea. He doesn't like the fact that she has not taken part in the com- shuk yet. Cordelia's proclamation writing is interrupted by Silas who brings forth a large platter and orders Groosalugg out of the room. He tells her she and Groosalugg are just tools and she will do what she is told. Cordelia refuses to accept that, until she is shocked into silence as Silas reveals Lorne's head displayed on the platter. Production details Makeup Artist Dayne Johnson says that this episode was one of the most time-consuming for the makeup department. The full-body green makeup used to transform Andy Hallett into a Pylean took three hours, and the dozens of Pylean extras required 14 makeup artists beginning at 2:30am. =Acting= Series creator Joss Whedon briefly appears in this episode playing Lorne's Pylean brother, \\"Numfar\\". Whedon wanted his appearance to be a big surprise, and so had his make-up done in another make-up trailer. When Andy Hallett, the actor who played Lorne, saw Whedon doing a \\"Dance of Joy\\" at rehearsal, he thought the unknown actor was \\"trash\\". =Continuity= * Angel tells children stories of his adventures in \\"To Shanshu in L.A.\\" such as when he cut Lindsey's hand off. Later, Landok asks Angel to tell a story about the events of \\"I Fall to Pieces\\". * After learning of the mating ritual, Cordelia tells Wesley, \\"I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with its spawn. Is that just too much to ask?\\" Cordelia was impregnated with the spawn of a Haxil demon in \\"Expecting\\" and was impregnated with the spawn of a Skilosh demon in \\"Epiphany.\\" *This episode reveals that the powers of Wolfram and Hart extend far beyond the human dimension when their animal symbols‚Äîa wolf, a ram, and a deer (hart)‚Äîare seen by Wes, Gunn, and Cordy in Pylea. In Season Five, Illyria remembers \\"the Wolf, Ram, and Hart\\" of her long-ago era, indicating this was the organization's original name. *As was pointed out as recently as \\"Disharmony,\\" in the Buffyverse, soulless vampires are not truly humans who have been transformed into vampires, but demons who inhabit the bodies of dead humans to become vampires, their personas shaped by the humans' memories. Prior to regaining his soul, Angel, originally named Liam, was such a being, a demon who, in combination with Angel's original personality, became Angel's evil persona Angelus; only the restoration of Angel's human soul (e.g. the original Liam whom the demon supplanted) suppressed the demon/Angelus. Angel's demonic form in this episode, which he inadvertently assumes when displaying his vampiric nature, is thus presumably the demon who originally possessed Liam's dead body, looking as it would without the human influence that originally caused it to become Angelus. =Cultural references= * Through the Looking-Glass: The episode's title is taken from the children's book by Lewis Carroll. * Durdane series : Also notable is a flavor of imagery, gadgetry and some plot devices from the books of Jack Vance's Durdane series, the first being 'The Faceless Man'. * Lorne calls Angel \\"Hans Christian Tarantino\\" at the conclusion of Angel's storytelling session about the events in To Shanshu in L.A., presumably because Hans Christian Andersen was a storyteller, and Quentin Tarantino is known for directing action/graphic movies. *When Gunn and Wesley are in the woods, Wesley shushes him because he hears something. Gunn asks him if he's having a \\"Blair Witch moment\\", referring to the cult film The Blair Witch Project.

Among the earliest works to enter the collection were paintings by significant Alabama artists including the miniaturist Hannah Elliott and the landscapist Carrie Hill. Throughout its history, the Museum has continued its commitment to the arts of Alabama. In 1995, it organized Made in Alabama, a groundbreaking survey of artistic production in the state during the 19th century. In addition to collecting the works of academically trained native artists, the Museum has built an impressive collection of folk art, including painting, sculpture, quilts, and pottery.

The Chellis Wedgwood Collection, the largest and most comprehensive special collection in the world related to Josiah Wedgwood and his manufactures, along with the Beeson rare book holdings, make this the U.S. center for the study of Wedgwood. Among these holdings are letters from John Flaxman and Benjamin West, and Sir William Hamilton‚Äôs Collection of Engravings from Antique Vases, known as the Hamilton Folios, the first European color- plate books. History =Birmingham Art Club= The roots of the museum date back to 1908 and the founding of the \\"Birmingham Art Club\\" which endeavored to amass a public art collection for the benefit of the citizens of Birmingham, which had been founded as a new industrial city only 37 years prior. In 1927 they were able to display their collection in the galleries of the new Birmingham Public Library. Over the next two decades the club continued to add to the collection and raise support in the press and in City Hall for the concept of a new building. =First exhibition= In September 1950 a governing board was created to oversee the creation of a museum as \\"an institution of public service, educational and recreational, with all the people welcome.\\" The following February the board hired Richard Foster Howard to serve as the first museum director. In April 1951 the newly established \\"Birmingham Museum of Art\\" presented a public \\"Opening Exhibition\\" housed in five unused rooms in City Hall. The exhibition included some pieces from the existing Art Club collection as well as a large number of loaned works from museums across the Eastern half of the United States. The result was considered to be \\"the finest showing of great objects of art in the South to date.\\" =New building= North public entrance off the west wing of the Birmingham Museum of Art. The publicity created by the exhibition led to several important gifts, notably of Chinese ceramics and textiles, Japanese prints, Old master prints, costumes, glass, and oil paintings. In 1952 the Samuel H. Kress Foundation presented 29 paintings from the Italian Renaissance as a long-term loan to the new museum, forming the core of the collection of European paintings. A large bequest in 1954 made possible a new museum building. Land was purchased the following year and a design commission for a new museum building was given to the office of Warren Knight & Davis. The \\"Oscar Wells Memorial Building\\" opened to the public on May 3, 1959. In the following years the Kress Foundation made two important gifts to the museum: the trusteeship of a collection of Renaissance furniture and decorative objects in 1959, and the deed to the Italian paintings already on loan, along with eight additional works from the same period. The following year, the American Cast Iron Pipe Company loaned its Lamprecht Collection of German cast-iron objects (the largest in the world). =Expansions= A level of upper floor galleries was added to the building's west wing in 1965, and the following year, the Clarence B. Hanson Jr. Library was opened on the building's first floor. In 1967 a new east wing was completed. Additional land was purchased in 1969, and in 1974 another addition included a three-story rebuilding of the east wing. Further reworking of the east wing added a conservation lab, loading dock, and a second public entrance to the building in 1979, and the following year, gallery space was expanded by 28,000 square feet (2,600 m¬≤). In 1986 another expansion project was planned and architect Edward Larrabee Barnes, in conjunction with local architect KPS Group, Inc., was selected to oversee the design, which included provision for a new outdoor sculpture garden and 50,000 square feet (5,000 m¬≤) of exhibition space bringing the total to 180,000 square feet (15,400 m¬≤).

Written and directed by David Greenwalt, it was originally broadcast on September 24, 2001 on the WB network. In this episode, Angel's former traveling companion James seeks revenge against Angel for staking his lover, Elisabeth. Plot Wesley, Cordelia and Gunn discuss their recent addition at the Hyperion Hotel, Winifred \\"Fred\\" Burkle, who has spent the last three months in her room (except when she enters the lobby for a few seconds before scurrying back). They note her bravery at surviving five years in Pylea. Also cause for concern is Angel, who has also spent the summer away from the group by spending time at a monastery in Sri Lanka since learning of Buffy's death. Wesley notes that all Angel needs is peace and quiet. Angel's mourning, however, is anything but peaceful as the monks turn out to be demons and Angel must kill them all. Angel returns to Los Angeles and is eagerly greeted by his friends. He gives Cordelia a necklace, Wesley an historical dagger and Gunn a shrunken head (all three gifts are greatly appreciated). Angel asks after Fred, and despite Cordelia's attempt to cover, Angel guesses she hasn't left her room. He decides to go and talk to her; upon hearing a knock on the door, Fred tries to get rid of whoever is on the other side until she hears it's Angel, then she trips over herself to see him. Invited into Fred's room, Angel finds the walls covered in writing, similar to Fred's cave in Pylea, mostly filled with arcane mathematical formulae. Upon seeing a section with the words \\"LISTEN LISTEN LISTEN\\", Angel asks what she's listening for, and Fred responds, \\"The click in my head when everything makes sense.\\" Angel invites her downstairs, but a scream from Cordelia shatters her sense of security. Cordelia's vision (which have grown increasingly painful over the last few months) sends the guys after a party crashed by vampires. They intercept the vampires and Angel stakes a beautiful blonde, and at the last second recognizes her by her locket as Elisabeth. Meanwhile, Cordelia recovers from her vision with the help of Dennis, a relaxing bath and some powerful painkillers. A flashback to Marseille, France, in 1767 reveals that Darla and Angelus once traveled with Elisabeth and James. Angelus is annoyed with the loving relationship between the other couple, as James steals a locket from a store window for Elisabeth. He is also concerned with escaping the vampire hunter, Daniel Holtz, who has been tracking him since Angelus killed the man's entire family. In the present, James learns about Elisabeth's death, and that Angel was responsible. He charges into the office of a special demon doctor, demanding the ultimate \\"cure\\" for vampirism. The demon, a skin-molting creature named Dr. Gregson, questions James's ability to accept the consequences, but agrees. At Caritas, Lorne sings, while Wesley and Gunn grill Merl for information. Merl reveals James visited Dr. Gregson earlier. At the Hyperion Hotel, James emerges from the basement and attacks Angel, demanding to know why he took Elisabeth from him. Fred chooses that moment to emerge, and Angel yells at her to stay in her room, causing the girl to lose what little confidence she had gained. The two continue to fight, and Cordelia manages a good hit to James with a fire extinguisher then tosses Angel a stake. Angel manages to stake James, but he is unaffected; Angel throws him outside, but he doesn't set on fire. Realising he has been made invincible, Angel and Cordelia run for the sewers. A call from Wesley reveals that James is now invincible after having his heart removed, but it's not permanent and he will die when it wears off. Angel tries to throw James off temporarily with the scent of his blood, but James eventually finds them in a subway train. As they fight inside the train, James questions Angel's knowledge of true love. Angel assures him he understands what it is like to lose someone he loves. Soon, the effects of the cure wear off, and James crumbles into dust. Angel allows James' comments about not being able to exist after losing the person he loved to upset him, but Cordelia convinces him that he honors Buffy by going on. At a cantina in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, a man presents contact information for a shaman to Darla and proceeds to flirt with her, offering her a drink and saying he sees her as a woman with a surprise or two. Darla retorts by showing him surprise #1: sinking her fangs into him. As he falls to the floor, Darla leaves the bar, revealing surprise #2: her incredibly pregnant belly. Acting Amy Acker joins the regular cast and opening credits as of this episode, and returning actress Julie Benz is billed as a special guest star again.

However, the film crew didn't begin shooting for a letterbox format until \\"That Old Gang of Mine\\"; this episode was originally filmed with a shorter aspect ratio and had to be re-transferred to the wider format before being aired. Adam Ward, the first assistant/focus puller, says the show has always framed for letterboxing so the transfer process went smoothly. \\"We were really happy to do it because it made everything a lot more cinematic,\\" he says. The outside shots of the Buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka is actually footage of a castle in Austria called Castle Hohenwerfen. Production designer Stuart Blatt says the Angel location department extensively researched monasteries from all over Asia before settling on a design for the set for the inside scenes; it was \\"one of the most fun things so far this year\\" to create. =Arc significance= * Angel's retreat destination, Sri Lanka, was previously mentioned in the Buffy episode \\"Phases\\", when werewolf hunter Cain revealed Sri Lanka has a profitable market for werewolf pelts. * This episode marks the first appearance of Holtz, who will become a major villain for the rest of the season. * In the flashbacks, Darla and Angel reminisce on the events of the flashback from season two's \\"The Trial\\", where Darla left Angel to fend for himself in a burning barn after Holtz cornered them in France. * Darla is revealed to be pregnant and in Central America.

He is best known as the composer of Jamaican Rumba (1938) and of the Storm Clouds Cantata, featured in both versions of the Alfred Hitchcock film The Man who Knew Too Much (1934), (1956). Biography Arthur Benjamin was born in Sydney on 18 September 1893 into a Jewish family, although he was a non-practicing Jew.http://www.musicweb- international.com/classrev/2002/Jun02/Arthur_Benjamin.htm His parents moved to Brisbane when Arthur was three years old. At the age of six, he made his first public appearance as a pianist and his formal musical training began three years later with George Sampson, the Organist of St John's Cathedral and Brisbane City Organist. In 1911, Benjamin won a scholarship from Brisbane Grammar School to the Royal College of Music (RCM), where he studied composition with Charles Villiers Stanford, harmony and counterpoint with Thomas Dunhill, and piano with Frederic Cliffe.Benjamin, Arthur. 'A Student in Kensington' in Music and Letters, July 1950, p 196-207 In 1914 he joined the Officer Training Corps, receiving a temporary commission in April 1915. He served initially in the infantry as 2nd Lieutenant with the 32nd Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers and in November 1917 he was attached to the Royal Flying Corps. On 31 July 1918 his aircraft was shot down over Germany by the young Hermann G√∂ring, and he spent the remainder of the war as a German prisoner of war at Ruhleben internment camp near Berlin. There he met the composer Edgar Bainton, who had been interned since 1914, and who was later to become director of the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. The manuscript of the unpublished Violin Sonata in E minor bears the date 1918, the only surviving work of that year and one of very few to be written by Benjamin during the war. He returned to Australia in 1919 and became piano professor at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, Sydney. He returned to England in 1921 to become piano professor at the RCM. Following his appointment in 1926 to a professorship which he held for the next thirteen years at the RCM, Benjamin developed a distinguished career as a piano teacher. His better-known students from that era include Muir Mathieson, Peggy Glanville-Hicks, Miriam Hyde, Joan Trimble, Stanley Bate, Bernard Stevens, Lamar Crowson, Alun Hoddinott, Dorian Le Gallienne, Natasha Litvin (later Stephen Spender's wife and a prominent concert pianist), William BlezardOxford Dictionary of National Biography and Benjamin Britten, whose Holiday Diary suite for solo piano is dedicated to Benjamin and mimics many of his teacher's mannerisms. He continued writing chamber works for the next few years ‚Äì Three Pieces for violin and piano (1919‚Äì24); Three Impressions (voice and string quartet, 1919); Five Pieces for Cello (1923); Pastoral Fantasy (string quartet, 1924), which won a Carnegie Award that year; Sonatina (violin and piano, 1924). Orchestral works became more common after 1927 ‚Äì Rhapsody on Negro Themes (MS 1919); Concertino for piano and orchestra (1926/7); Light Music Suite (1928); Overture to an Italian Comedy (1937); Cotillon Suite (1938). There also appeared over twenty meticulously crafted songs and choral settings. He was also an adjudicator and examiner for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, which led him to places such as Australia, Canada and the West Indies. It was in the West Indies that he discovered the native tune (Mango Walk) on which he based his best-known piece, Jamaican Rumba, one of Two Jamaican Pieces, composed in 1938, for which the Jamaican government gave him a free barrel of rum a year as thanks for making their country known.Boosey & Hawkes biography of Arthur Benjamin The Violin Concerto of 1932 was premiered by Antonio Brosa with Benjamin conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra. In 1935 he accompanied the 10-year-old Canadian cellist Lorne Munroe on a concert tour of Europe. Three years later he wrote a Sonatina for Munroe, who later became the principal cellist with the Philadelphia Orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, and also recorded the piece. His Romantic Fantasy for Violin, Viola and Orchestra was premiered by Eda Kersey and Bernard Shore in 1938, under the composer.David CF Wright; Eda Kersey Its first recording was by Jascha Heifetz and William Primrose. He resigned from his post at the RCM and left to settle in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he remained for the duration of the war. In 1941 he was appointed conductor of the newly formed CBC Symphony Orchestra, holding the post until 1946. During this time he gave \\"literally hundreds\\" of Canadian first performances.\\"Benjamin ‚Äì Australian Symphonist\\" by Robert Barnett After a series of radio talks and concerts in addition to music teaching, conducting and composing, he became a major figure in Canadian musical life. He frequently visited the United States, broadcasting and arranging many performances of contemporary British music. He was also Resident Lecturer at Reed College, Portland, Oregon between 1944 and 1945. Notable students include composer Pamela Harrison. The Elegiac Mazurka of 1941 was commissioned as part of the memorial volume 'Homage to Paderewski' in honour of the Polish pianist who had died that year. In 1945 a shortened piano solo arrangement of the Jamaican Rumba was published. The other major original works written during the 1950s were the Harmonica Concerto (1953), written for Larry Adler, who performed it many times and recorded it at least twice; the ballet Orlando's Silver Wedding (1951), Tombeau de Ravel for clarinet and piano, a second string quartet (1959) and the Wind Quintet (1960). He had a lasting admiration for Maurice Ravel, whose influence is most obvious in Tombeau de Ravel and the much earlier Suite of 1926 for piano solo. He was honoured by the Worshipful Company of Musicians by the award of the Cobbett Medal later that year (1957). His private students included John Carmichael. Arthur Benjamin died on 10 April 1960, at the age of 66, at the Middlesex Hospital, London, from a re-occurrence of the cancer that had first attacked him three years earlier. An alternative explanation of the immediate cause of death is hepatitis, contracted while Benjamin and his partner, Jack Henderson, a Canadian who worked in the music publishing business,Michael Green (2004) Around and About, Memoirs of a South African Newspaperman, New Africa Books (Pty) Ltd. were holidaying with the Australian painter Donald Friend in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). =Operas= Benjamin wrote four operas. The one-act opera The Devil Take Her, to a libretto by Alan Collard and John B. Gordon, was first produced at the RCM on 1 December 1931, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham. Another one-acter, Prima Donna (1932) had to wait until 23 February 1949 for its premiere, at the Fortune Theatre in London. Its libretto was by Cedric Cliffe, son of Benjamin's piano teacher at the RCM, Frederic Cliffe. A Tale of Two Cities (1950), and Ma√±ana were full-length operas. The librettist for the former was again Cedric Cliffe. First produced by Dennis Arundell during the Festival of Britain in 1951, it won a gold medal and was later broadcast in a live performance by BBC Radio 3 on 17 April 1953. After this performance, Benjamin revised the piece into its final version. The opera was successfully produced in this form in San Francisco in April 1960, only days before his death. Ma√±ana was commissioned in 1955 and produced by BBC television on 1 February 1956. Unfortunately, it was judged a flop at the time and never revived. A fifth opera, Tartuffe, with a libretto by Cedric Cliffe based on Moli√®re, was unfinished at Benjamin's death. The scoring was completed by the composer Alan Boustead and the work produced by the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells on 30 November 1964, conducted by Boustead. This appears to have been this opera's only performance. =Films= Benjamin was equally active as a writer of music for films, beginning in 1934 with The Scarlet Pimpernel, an adaptation of music from the Napoleonic era, and Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934, remade 1956), for which Benjamin composed the Storm Clouds Cantata. Other scores included those for Alexander Korda's 1947 film of An Ideal Husband, The Conquest of Everest, The Cumberland Story (1947), Steps of the Ballet (British Council/Central Office of Information 1948), Master of Bankdam (Holbein Films 1947), Above Us the Waves (1955) and Fire Down Below (1957). While most of his music scores are archived in the British Library, his film scores are completely lost. Apart from the Boosey & Hawkes edition of An Ideal Husband the only surviving score is the Storm Clouds Cantata. =Premieres as pianist= Arthur Benjamin gave a number of important premieres including: * Herbert Howells' Piano Concerto No. 1 (1913) * Arthur Bliss's suite Masks for solo piano by (2 February 1926) * Constant Lambert's Concerto for piano and 9 players (18 December 1931, Lambert conducting) * the British premiere of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue =Tributes from other composers= Herbert Howells wrote an orchestral suite The Bs, in five movements, each celebrating a close friend. The work was first performed in 1914, and ends with an heraldic march movement entitled \\"Benjee\\", saluting Arthur Benjamin, who the previous year had given the premiere of Howells' Piano Concerto No. 1. Howells' orchestral piece Procession (written for the 1922 Proms) is dedicated to Benjamin. Benjamin, in turn, later dedicated the three-page Saxophone Blues (1929) to Howells. The Australian pianist and composer Ian Munro, who has a special affinity with Arthur Benjamin and has recorded many of his piano works, has written a small biography of Benjamin.Tall Poppies Records References External links * *Biography, Boosey & Hawkes * 1893 births 1960 deaths 20th-century classical composers Jewish Australian musicians Jewish classical composers Light music composers Australian male classical composers Alumni of the Royal College of Music Academics of the Royal College of Music Piano pedagogues Musicians from Brisbane Musicians from Sydney Pupils of Charles Villiers Stanford Australian military personnel of World War I World War I prisoners of war held by Germany LGBT classical musicians LGBT composers LGBT Jews LGBT musicians from Australia Australian expatriates in the United Kingdom Australian expatriates in Canada Benjamin Britten Australian prisoners of war Australian classical composers Australian military musicians ","title":"Arthur Benjamin"},{"id":"3528070","text":"\\"Carpe Noctem\\" is episode 4 of season 3 in the television show Angel. Plot synopsis Fred shares her admiration for Angel in front of the rest of the team as she theorizes what he is reading upstairs. Angel comes down from his room with a newspaper and invites everyone to a Charlton Heston double feature, which only Fred is delighted to accept. The next evening, Fred gushes about her date to Wesley and Cordelia. Concerned, Cordelia instructs Angel to have a talk with besotted Fred, which Angel avoids by bringing up a string of deaths in hotels which involved melted bodies and insists he needs to investigate right away. The team find out that the men killed were all members of the same gym. Angel and Cordelia arrive there and Cordelia promptly interviews the muscled men and questions them - for their phone numbers. Angel notices a retirement home across the street where an old man is seen peering at them with binoculars. He leaves Cordelia and confronts the old man, Marcus, who recites a spell that switches their bodies. While Marcus enjoys himself in Angel's vampiric body, Angel tries to leave the retirement home in the frail Marcus's body to warn the gang of the impostor in their midst. Meanwhile, Lilah continues to clash with her co-worker Gavin over their tactics to take down Angel and his group. She goes to Angel with documents that would foil Gavin's attempt to evacuate the hotel since it wasn't \\"up to code\\" to one-up him. Marcus in Angel's body tells her she is a very beautiful woman and they start kissing each other furiously. Fred, who was given the same line by Marcus earlier and instructed her to wear something pretty to go out, sees them and runs away in tears. Marcus vamps out in his passion and bites Lilah. who is furious with him for playing games and runs out. Marcus tries to find out what happened and is shocked to find he doesn't have a reflection. He spends the night shredding contents of files related to his murders and goes through books researching vampires, realizing this body will never give out on him and planning to kill Angel in his old one. Cordelia finds Fred sobbing in the elevator and finds out about \\"Angel\\"'s actions. Wesley finds the office littered with the books and correctly theorizes that Angel's body has been taken over. He, Gunn, Cordelia, and Fred rescue Angel from being killed and he is returned to his own form. Marcus angrily tells him he wastes his life instead of taking advantage of what he has. Angel tells him his heart is weak because he doesn't use it. An upset Marcus has an onset of a fifth heart attack as Angel and his team walk out together. Back at the Hyperion, Angel finally sits down with Fred for the long-overdue talk however she stops him, as Cordelia has already explained to her about Angel's curse as well as his having no romantic feelings for her. As Fred notes that Angel will probably be better off without love in his life, Willow calls the hotel to tell the group that Buffy has been revived, five months after her death. Writing =Arc significance= *Angel and his team learn that Buffy is alive again through a phone call by Willow. *Crossover with Buffy: Buffy meets Angel immediately after this episode. Although this meeting is the subject of Jane Espenson's Buffy/Angel comic, Reunion, the real events which occurred at the meeting are never revealed, as the comics only depict the speculations made by the Scoobies about it. *Cordelia's mentioning of Angel doing the \\"mystery dance with a cheap blonde\\" is a reference to Angel's previous relationships with Buffy and Darla, both of whom are blondes. *Fred's feelings towards Angel, that have been building up ever since their first meeting in Pylea, are addressed by Cordelia and Angel, making it clear to Fred that it won't work out. = Critical reception = Noel Murray of The A.V. Club wrote his opinion that it \\"was entertaining in spots but largely struck me as a missed opportunity ‚Äî one that was over before it really began. The main purpose of the episode seemed to be to defuse any growing romantic feelings Fred might have for Angel, by letting her see why Angel's not the relationship type.\\" Ryan Bovay of Critically Touched likewise gave it a lukewarm review: an episode with \\"some fun qualities but not a great deal to talk about,\\" succeeding \\"where it does because of the considerable talents of the main cast, who really know how to live their characters in each of their own subtle, loving ways\\" though with \\"sub-par writing\\" to make \\"the episode watch- able and even enjoyable.\\" References External links Angel (season 3) episodes 2001 American television episodes Buffyverse crossover episodes Fiction about body swapping ","title":"Carpe Noctem (Angel)"},{"id":"3528082","text":"\\"Fredless\\" is episode 5 of season 3 in the television show Angel. Written by Mere Smith and directed by Marita Grabiak, it was originally broadcast on October 22, 2001 on the WB network. Fred's parents, Roger and Trish Burkle, arrive in town from Texas to take her home with them, prompting Fred to run away. Angel learns that Fred's problems with her mother and father are purely emotional while Mr. and Mrs. Burkle prove themselves to be formidable fighters against demons. Meanwhile, the gang is unknowingly in danger after Angel beheads a vicious demon whose head is the breeding ground for a strain of insect demons, causing a swarm of giant cockroaches to lay siege to the hotel in order to retrieve their offspring. Plot Fred asks about Angel's relationship with Buffy, curious because he left so abruptly to meet her at the end of the previous episode. Cordelia and Wesley put on an overly- dramatic, humorous play that summarizes what Angel and Buffy's off-screen reunion might have been like. When Angel returns, he invites Fred out to ice cream, but ends up tracking a Durslar demon into the sewers. Fred notices some crystal formations on the sewer wall before Angel sends her back to the Hyperion Hotel for safety. The gang reorganize the weapons cabinet, bored and anxious for a job. Cordelia discovers an object that could be a weapon or a toaster that Fred was making. A couple, Roger and Trish Burkle, enter the hotel searching for assistance in finding their lost daughter, Fred, whom another private detective traced to Angel Investigations. The Burkles are oblivious to the supernatural so Cordelia, Wesley, and Gunn lie about Fred's disappearance and their work. When Fred returns and sees the couple in the lobby, she dashes upstairs unseen. She tries to erase the writing she scribbled over her bedroom walls, then leaves the hotel. Angel returns with the severed head of the Durslar demon and is introduced to the Burkles as their associate who also works in movies, hence the \\"fake\\" demon head. They all head upstairs, but find her room empty. While the Burkles wait out in the lobby, Angel and crew converse about the possible reasons for Fred to run away from her parents and whether the Burkles are being completely honest. They join the Burkles again and everyone splits up to find her. After roaming the streets alone, Fred ends up at Caritas and tries to get help from Lorne, who is bitter about the recent fight that destroyed much of his bar. She sings without provocation and exposes her obvious fear and panic to him. He knows what she's running from and she doesn't realize she's strong enough to face it. Eventually, the rest of the gang end up at Caritas, but Lorne refuses to play along with attempts to keep the Burkles oblivious to demonic activity and expresses his distaste for being used all the time. Finally, Lorne reveals that Fred is at the bus station. When her family and friends show up, Fred doesn't want to admit that her parents are real because it means her awful experience in Pylea was real, but finally breaks down. Just then, a giant bug demon that followed Angel from the sewers attacks the group. Weaponless, Angel tries to handle the demon alone; all attempts to hide the truth from the Burkles are forgotten as the group rushes to Gunn's truck for fighting tools. Angel continues the fight with the bug demon until Trish Burkle kills it by driving a bus into it. Back at the hotel, Fred notices the crystals she saw in the sewers on the Durslar's head. Fred wonders about her place in the gang while her parents are just grateful to have their daughter back. They reveal how they were prepared to call the police, thinking Angel and friends kidnapped their daughter. She decides that she wants to go home with her parents because she doesn't really belong with the rest of the group. As Fred packs, she tells Angel she wrote her life story on her bedroom wall. After Fred leaves with her parents, many bug demons begin to show up at the hotel. Fred, who has realized in the cab that the cockroach demons would return, rushes back to deploy her toaster weapon, sending an ax flying at the severed demon head. The head splits open, releasing little bugs that the other demons collect before departing. Fred explains how she realized the little crystals were dried ichor from the bug demon, indicating a connection between it and the severed head. Fred decides she does have a place at Angel Investigations after all, and invites everyone up to her room, where they help her paint the walls. Fred paints over a picture she drew of her and Angel on the horse from Pylea. Production Fred's mother mentions her husband fell asleep while watching the film Alien: Resurrection, which was written by series creator Joss Whedon. =Arc significance= * This episode marks Fred's cementation into the main group. Up until this point, it was uncertain if Fred's run on the show would mimic Doyle's, in which Joss Whedon had Glenn Quinn in the title credits only for 10 episodes until he let Doyle's character go. * Angel and Buffy's meeting, which is never shown on screen, is the subject of a comic by Buffy writer Jane Espenson called Reunion. Cultural References * Near the end of the episode Fred's mother is talking to Cordelia about how Fred's father loves the Alien movies, then she says \\"Except for the last one, I think he dozed off\\" She's referring to Alien Resurrection which was written by Joss Whedon.

Written by Tim Minear and Jeffrey Bell and directed by David Grossman, it was originally broadcast on October 29, 2001 on the WB television network. In this episode, Angel investigates a wave of violence against women throughout Los Angeles, caused by Billy's ability to infect men with murderous misogyny. Cordelia seeks the aid of Lilah, who is a victim of Billy‚Äôs power, while Fred finds herself in danger from an infected Wesley. Plot Angel teaches Cordelia how to sword fight so that she can defend herself if Angel isn't there to protect her. Due to her cheerleading experience, she is a fast study. Lilah finds Billy (the man Angel was forced to rescue from a fiery hell dimension by the lawyers of Wolfram & Hart in \\"That Vision Thing\\") in her office talking with Gavin Park. The influential Congressman Blim, Billy's uncle, arrives to take the young man home. After Billy and the congressman leave, Lilah tells Gavin to stay away from her clients. Gavin isn't interested in her suggestions and suddenly attacks her, smashing her head into a glass case and strangling her. Cordy and Wesley discuss Cordelia's training with Angel, and Wesley suggests he train Fred, leading Cordelia to inquire about his romantic feelings for Fred. She suggests that he ask her out, but their conversation is cut short by a vision of a woman being beaten by her husband in a convenience store. Strangely, the event occurred a week ago and the woman is now dead. Wesley learns that the husband's explanation for killing his wife was simply that \\"she wouldn't stop talking\\" and gets surveillance photos from the crime, in which they spot Billy. After learning that Angel freed Billy to save her, Cordelia feels responsible for the woman's death, but Angel assures her the blame belongs to Lilah. He visits Lilah at her apartment and is shocked to find her badly beaten. She says Billy is untouchable due to his political connections. Wesley, Gunn, and Angel track down Billy; however, the police arrive first to take Billy into custody for phoning in a tip on the location of a murder victim. Before he's taken away, Billy touches one of the officers on the arm. Later in the squad car, Sanchez's female partner doesn't take the route he tells her to, causing him to get angry and hit her repeatedly. Fred relays information from a police scanner, saying that Billy got away before arriving at the station. It is later discovered that after being hit by her partner, the female cop shot him and is now resting in the hospital. At the scene of the crime, Angel realizes that some of the blood is Billy's, and Wesley takes a sample of his blood to examine at the hotel. Cordelia goes to Lilah's to demand information, and Lilah explains that Billy's touch turns men into vicious misogynists, though the effect varies from male to male. Wesley returns to the hotel and Fred helps him examine Billy's blood cells through the microscope and observes that his power is in his blood, saliva, and sweat. Wesley begins to act hostile towards Fred, and when she runs from the office, he catches her and tosses her face-first into the stairs. He stalks her through the hotel with an axe in his hand. As she runs, she is caught by Gunn and taken into one of the bedrooms. Following reports of misogynistic violence, Angel tracks Billy's last location to a party at his cousin's house, where he discovers that Billy's entire family is aware of his situation and want him gone. Cordelia finds Billy waiting for a private plane at the airport. He's not interested in talking with her, and she isn't either, debilitating him with a stun gun to his groin. Angel arrives to help Cordelia, and Billy touches Angel's face. In the bedroom, Gunn realizes that he too has been infected after touching the bloody paper down in the lobby. He tries to leave, but Wesley is blocking the door, so Gunn has Fred knock him unconscious. Wesley breaks into the room, insulting Fred as he advances toward her. She pulls a rope which sends a fire extinguisher flying down to hit Wesley in the face and send him falling through a hole in the floor. Meanwhile, at the airport, Angel turns on Billy and hits him, explaining that Billy's power doesn't affect him. As Angel and Billy fight, Lilah shoots Billy dead before Cordelia can get a clear shot with her crossbow. Days later, Cordelia and Angel continue with their training, as Angel reveals that the reason he wasn't affected by Billy's touch was that he left behind the capacity to hate long ago. Meanwhile, Wesley, who has kept to himself since the incident, receives a visit from Fred. She doesn't blame him for what happened, but he blames himself. Concerned that violence is a part of him, he doesn't know who he is or how to return to life as it was before. Fred says he's needed at the office and insists that she knows he had no control over what happened. Fred leaves when Wesley agrees to return to the office. As the door closes, she can hear him crying on the other side. Production The episode invokes the Kennedy Family---who also have prominent political connections.

International career In September 2006, Hampshire's Australian county captain Shane Warne publicly highlighted Mascarenhas' tremendous ability and issued a call for him to be rewarded with selection for the England One Day International (ODI) team. On 13 September 2006 he wrote in The Times: \\"It amazes me that England have never given him a chance in the one-day side. He is the best finisher with the bat in all situations in the country and his bowling is clever and accurate\\". He subsequently made his ODI debut on 1 July 2007 at Lord's against the West Indies, scoring 2 runs and completing 4 overs for 18 runs. On 5 September 2007, in an ODI against India, he hit consecutive sixes off the final five balls of England's innings, which were bowled by Yuvraj Singh.

He was fined ¬£1000 by Hampshire and ¬£500 by the ECB. The panel considered this to be a serious breach of the regulations, particularly given his status as a senior cricketer and club captain. Mascarenhas also stated that he tweeted this after a night out and his actions were stupid and irresponsible and that he regretted any offence it may have caused and that his tweet didn't reflect his true views on Miller.  Coaching  He has completed an ECB level-three coaching qualification and held player-coach roles with Hampshire, Rajasthan Royals and Hobart Hurricanes. In June 2015 Mascarenhas was appointed as New Zealand's full-time bowling coach having been head coach of New Zealand domestic side Otago since 2014.

Written by David Greenwalt and directed by Turi Meyer, it was original broadcast on November 5, 2001 on the WB television network. While Angel and the crew research a prophecy predicting the imminent arrival of a being who may have a profound impact on the world, Darla, pregnant and angry, arrives at the hotel looking for Angel, who is shocked to learn that he is Darla's unborn child's father. Baffled by Darla's condition, Angel turns to Lorne for some insight on this situation while Darla gets a sympathetic ear from Cordelia, who forgets in her compassion that Darla is still very evil, while Angel struggles to discover the nature of their unborn child. Plot In a flashback to Rome, 1771, Angelus flees through the sewers from a group of priests, but is eventually cornered and then Daniel Holtz arrives. He appreciates the priest's assistance in capturing and chaining Angelus, then begins to torture the vampire for his murderous crimes against Holtz's family. Holtz continues his torture as he carries on a conversation with Angelus about his family, Darla and their attempts to hide. Darla eventually arrives with more vampires who kill the priests, rescue Angelus and leave Holtz hurt, but alive, as they ride away hidden by a blanket on a cart. Darla gets off of a bus, leaving behind mostly dead passengers. Cordelia and Angel continue with their training and Cordelia has now begun to work on fighting without weapons. He says she can't hurt him, but Cordelia hits him in the face and clearly causes a little bit of pain. They talk about Wesley and Gunn, who are investigating a Nyazian scroll that could forecast the end of the world. Meanwhile,Wesley and Gunn enter a guarded building and find a room with countless artifacts and expensive items. An armed man catches them and threatens to call the police, but Wesley and Gunn threaten the artifacts and the man lets them get what they came for. Fred walks in on Cordelia and Angel's training session just as Cordelia ends the session. After Cordelia leaves, Fred mentions that she thinks there is some kind of physical attraction between Angel and Cordelia, which Angel quickly refutes. Just then, Wesley pulls Fred away from Angel to work on deciphering the scrolls. Fred's math skills are useful but she has some difficulty figuring out the proper date for the world's end. Wesley explains the text and the bringing of a \\"Tro-klon\\" being that will end mankind, and with Cordelia's help retells the results of their last scroll investigation for Fred's purpose. Angel, thinking about his earlier conversation with Fred, watches Cordelia as she works. When she asks him about his strange behavior, he starts awkwardly mentioning their history together. She gets freaked out at first, but then starts a chain of professing love between all of the gang, thinking Angel fears the world ending and wants to express his love to her and all of his friends. Angel uses her misinterpretation to get out of the awkward situation and the subject is dropped. Darla arrives at the hotel and shocks the whole gang with her very pregnant state. Darla accuses Angel of causing her pregnancy deliberately, but he's just as shocked as she is of them somehow being able to conceive in addition to being embarrassed and distressed by the whole situation. Both Darla and Angel want to find out what's inside of the former, in addition Darla wants to terminate her pregnancy while Angel initially denies of his forthcoming fatherhood; he ultimately become fearful of both it and his unborn child's nature. In need of answers, the gang find Lorne in the process of rebuilding the club and the Furies casting a new spell to prevent all violence in the club. After a brief, but unnecessary line of song from Darla, Lorne reveals that he's just as stumped as the rest of them about the creature inside of her. Darla starts to cry out in pain and is escorted back to Lorne's room where Cordelia, keeps her company. Angel still denies the possibility of Darla's pregnancy and questions the baby's connection to the prophecy. He doesn't know whether his purpose was supposed to bring forth the evil or destroy it. Cordelia talks to Darla about being pregnant. Cordelia brings up Darla's ability to drink blood, which leads to the vampire attacking Cordelia as she reveals her hunger is constant and uncontrollable. Cordelia fights back with a few hits, but Darla is stronger and bites her. A powerful vision hits Cordelia which allows her to push Darla away from her neck long enough for Angel to show up and intervene. Darla biting Cordelia has motivated him enough to kill his sire, but she's already gone. Cordy is taken to a safe place to rest where she blames herself for trusting Darla and tells Angel about her vision. She reveals how hungry Darla is and that she might be at an arcade with many children to feed from. Angel leaves her to get weapons and find Darla. Wesley is worried about Darla's new and improved strength that's a result of her unborn child, but Angel feels responsible and refuses help, and Fred understands that Angel do not wish to kill his offspring yet he hopelessly feels that he has no choice, due to likelihood that the child would be born as a vampire. Cordelia gets another vision about Darla's baby and goes to talk to Wesley and the rest of the gang about it. Angel stops Darla from killing a young boy and tries to stake her, but she stops him and taunts him. The two fight viciously and Angel ends up in a position to stake her, but he hesitates and later realizes the baby inside of Darla has both a heartbeat and a soul, which is what's driving her so crazy and making her so hungry for the pure blood of children. Darla denies the truth and Angel does everything he can to comfort her while having hope for his child. Back at the hotel, Darla has returned with Angel and rests in one of the bedrooms. She rejects the animal blood Angel offers her and tells Angel to leave her alone. Downstairs, research on the prophecy continues as Angel instructs the women to stay away from Darla unless he or Gunn are with them. Angel and Cordy discuss the baby and Angel's feelings towards it, and Angel begins to take responsibility for it as a father. Fred finally deciphers the text of the prophecy; she reveals that this being is arriving right then while unbeknownst to the gang, a demon is performing a ritual underground in front of a large stone. The ritual complete, the stone crumbles away, revealing a newly revived Holtz, eager to find Angelus. Production In an essay examining cinematic effects on Angel, Tammy Kinsey points out how this episode uses \\"several excellent examples of cinematic experimentation\\", such as when Darla attacks Cordelia while she is having a vision. Although the scene only lasts about twenty seconds, Kinsey argues that the use of slow motion and repetition \\"makes it seem to go on much longer.\\" The flashes of light and movement \\"press the viewer into a space of anxiety and terror\\", Kinsey writes, \\"reminiscent of the paintings of Francis Bacon\\". Another avant-garde technique is used when Cordelia later has a vision about Darla's baby; a lab process called bleach bypass, which leaves silver deposits on the film stock, intensifies the blacks while desaturating the colors. This gives the scene \\"a creepy uncertainty\\", Kinsey says. \\"We do not know whether this is visionary or a daydream, and the shift in formal design elements here enhances the surreal feeling.\\" =Continuity= *Lorne acts surprised as he finds out that Angel slept with Darla, even though Angel went to see him afterwards and said, \\"Okay keep your pants on (Angel walks into Lorne's view). Well I think we're too late for that.\\" This does not necessarily indicate that Lorne knew whom Angel had slept with, merely that he had recently had sex. =Arc significance= *Holtz is awakened in the present. *Sahjhan appears for the first time. *Darla returns to Angel Investigations to bring Angel the news that he is going to be a father. *Angel Investigations not only learn about Darla's pregnancy but also finally discover Angel and Darla slept together recently. *Lorne starts rebuilding Caritas and the Furies once again turn it into a sanctuary. * Fred points out for the first time the mutual attraction between Angel and Cordelia. This attraction will continue to develop throughout the series till Cordelia's departure. * Cordelia appears to be hurt and betrayed by the fact that Angel slept with Darla even though she knew about it in \\"Disharmony\\".

Plot synopsis In York, England, 1764, Holtz pursues Angelus and Darla, following a trail they left for him. Meanwhile, Angelus and Darla make their way into the Holtzs' house and kill his wife and two children. Holtz arrives at his house, but the vampires are gone and his family is dead. In the present, Angel visits Darla as she sleeps in his room, dreading yet maintaining hope that their child is not evil. Holtz learns about the present day through numerous television screens which play out different historical events that Holtz has missed during his sleep. Sahjhan is the demon that brought Holtz back and has been keeping an eye on Angelus for the hunter for 227 years, ever since Holtz was first preserved. Angel and Darla reminisce about the night that got them into the whole parent mess in the first place. The rest of the gang interrupt with new information about the scrolls and prophecies. They have discovered that instead of the \\"tro-klon\\" being a person's arrival, it is instead interpreted as different events. The gang begin to discuss possible ways to destroy the baby, whether it be evil or not, but Angel wants his child protected and refuses to let anyone hurt it, before or after it is born. Cordelia is reluctant to protect Darla or the baby but is more willing after she gets her delayed revenge by punching Darla in the face. Almost immediately after though, Darla begins to feel the pain of contractions. Lilah signs a document in blood and offers it to a mailroom employee. The employee, Cyril, offers her a disk in exchange which contains pictures of Angel and Lilah making out in his office from when he was possessed. Cyril says that he is on her side willing to work against Gavin Park, who had bugs planted at the hotel by supposed exterminators. Lilah confronts Gavin about it and finds that Cyril was just playing her. Gavin has video cameras and audio transcripts from the daily activities at the hotel and just wanted to brag to Lilah about his accomplishments. Together, they look at some of the video and are both shocked to see a very pregnant Darla on the screen. Since it is impossible for a vampire to get pregnant, Lilah is quickly on the phone. Darla's contractions are still far apart, but the pain is the kind she doesn't like and she wants the baby out. The gang discusses doctor options and agree that need access to medical equipment that will allow them to see what is actually inside of the vampire. Lilah and Gavin talk with Linwood, whom Lilah has called to notify about Darla's development. They discuss how no one at Wolfram & Hart saw it coming and that the Senior Partners need to be kept in the dark. Meanwhile, a spying Cyril makes a call to a Master Tarfall and informs him that the predictions were correct and the word must be spread to the others. Nine years after losing his family, Holtz thinks back, but his thoughts are interrupted by the demon, Sahjhan. The first encounter between the two has Sahjhan knowing Holtz's future and predicting just when the hunter will face and destroy Angelus and Darla. Holtz is reluctant to believe the demon or accept his aid at first, but soon agrees to be brought two-hundred plus years into the future for his one opportunity to finally destroy the vampires who took away his family. Darla is brought to a hospital where the gang uses an empty examining room to ultrasound Darla's womb. Her contractions have stopped, perhaps temporarily, but she is no less eager to rid her body of the baby inside. Holtz is tired of waiting to take out Angel and Darla, but Sahjhan insists on his patience if Holtz is to succeed. Switching to a human appearance, Sahjhan leads the way out of the underground space as they are about to make a move with the aid of some others. At Wolfram and Hart, the psychics are questioned by Linwood and then killed because of their inability to predict Darla's pregnancy. The lawyers know that the baby of two vampires is the desired possession of many groups. Linwood informs Lilah that she will receive the blame in the case that the Senior Partners discover their mistake. Despite some confusion, the gang is able to identify Darla's baby as a human and a boy, which pleases Angel and he fully accepts his coming fatherhood, though Darla is preoccupied with her pain. A large group of vampires begin to line the room and fill the observation area above, but they are there to protect the baby, not hurt it. However, Cordelia, Wesley, Gunn and Fred are classified as food for Darla and her child and orders are given to kill them. Sahjhan brings Holtz to a gym where their \\"minions\\" await for Holtz's instruction. The lawyers at Wolfram and Hart plan their attack on the hotel to acquire the baby from Darla. Gavin works with a military leader on getting into the hotel and Lilah arranges for a special doctor who will do the actual delivery. When her own life is threatened Darla is forced to help in the fight that is about to erupt at the hospital between the vampires and the gang. Fred holds a knife to Darla's stomach which holds the vampires off temporarily, but Fred unintentionally informs the other vampires that the knife can't hurt the baby and the fight starts. The gang is able to escape unharmed despite the vampires and military men throughout the hospital. Darla tries to hide her true feelings, but Angel senses her human-like feelings towards her unborn child. The gang make plans for a quick stop at the hotel for the scrolls but intend to get out of town. Holtz attacks the military men guarding the hotel and proceeds inside where the doctor and others are waiting for Angel and Darla to return. Holtz disposes of the men and doctor, much to the surprise of Wolfram and Hart's lawyers who watch and listen to the battle with the surveillance equipment. Angel leaves Darla and his friends parked in an empty alley while he goes for the scrolls. He directs them to leave without him if he doesn't return in five minutes. He finds the hotel a mess and his old enemy, Holtz, waiting for him. Darla screams as her water has broken and she's gone into active labor, but Angel still hasn't returned. Production details In the scene where Wolfram and Hart's surveillance tapes from the hotel are being transcribed, the dialogue being typed up by the man monitoring the cameras is from the previous episode, but it doesn't match up exactly. For example, after being hit by Cordelia in the previous episode, Angel tells her, \\"You can't hurt me - I'm a vampire,\\" but in the transcription on-screen his line is recorded as, \\"No, no, that's good.\\" =Continuity= *Wolfram & Hart learn of Darla's return and pregnancy through the videocameras Gavin Park had installed a few episodes earlier (which is only revealed in this episode). *Linwood Murrow makes his first appearance on the show. *Sahjhan brings Holtz up to date about the two hundred years he missed and also shows he can take human form. *Lilah can be seen talking to the two mind-readers who helped Holland to discover Lee Mercer's betrayal in the first season. *We witness the murder of Holtz's wife and children, which although talked about in earlier episodes had not been shown so far.

Written and directed by Tim Minear, it was originally broadcast on November 19, 2001 on the WB network. Vampire hunter Holtz‚Äôs rekindled crusade to kill Angel and Darla complicates the impending birth of the couple‚Äôs baby, while the rest of the group seeks sanctuary at Caritas. Meanwhile, Lilah Morgan employs a scroll translator to help out with an ominous prophecy concerning the birth of Angel's son. Plot At the Hyperion Hotel, Angel is shocked that Holtz is really in front of him, concluding Holtz was the darkness prophesied. Several of Holtz's minions take Angel captive, binding him by metal contraptions so that Holtz can torture him with holy water while discussing their long history together, with Angel trying to resolve their feuds. Holtz sends some of his minions to find Darla, who is screaming her way through her pre-labor while the gang worries about Angel and try to think of a plan to deliver the baby without the scrolls. In a flashback to 1764, after Angelus kills Holtz's family, Holtz mourns over his wife's body and hears the voice of his daughter as she approaches with her doll. He discovers from the bite mark on her neck that she was made into a vampire. She still seems to be an afraid little girl (however she is incapable to grieve over the deaths of her mother and brother due to the loss of her soul) and Holtz offers comforts and a lullaby to her, even though he knows his daughter is now dead. He pulls her outside the next day and throws her into the sunlight, where she shows her vampire face before she is destroyed. In the present, Holtz reminisces about his pursuit of Angelus and Darla through the years. Angel wants to know how Holtz is alive two hundred years later, and tries to persuade Holtz that he now has a soul, but Holtz is uninterested. Lilah arrives at the hotel with intentions to do business with Holtz, but she's willing to wait until Angel has been sufficiently tortured. She informs Holtz of Angel's soul, which Holtz finds intriguing and confusing. Angel locates a hand grenade left by the military men and removes the pin. The resulting explosion sends Angel flying through the elevator doors and giving him an escape. Holtz informs Lilah of his claim on Angel's unlife, and Lilah mentions Darla, unlike Angel, is still evil. After Holtz leaves, Lilah discovers a burnt piece of the scroll, which she takes. Meanwhile, Holtz's minions have arrived to threaten Darla and the others, until Darla runs over the demons with Angel's car then takes off. Angel leaves to find Darla while Lilah provides the piece of scroll and Wesley's notes to a translator at the law firm. After studying it, the translator informs Lilah that the prophecy does not predict birth, it predicts death at the time of the rain storm. Holtz discusses with Sahjhan how Angel's curse was wrongfully left out of the information Holtz was provided with. Sahjhan saw no importance in it, but Holtz explains that the game is different now as is the prey. Angel finds Darla on a rooftop; she ponders the world and the reasons for bringing a child into it. Without a doubt, Darla loves her unborn child, but only feels that love because of the soul within her child. She knows there's nothing she has to give to the child and fears what will happen when it has left her. Meanwhile, Lorne is testing the mystical \\"no violence\\" security system at the rebuilt demon bar Caritas by having Fred slap Gunn, proving that it still needs work. Wesley calls Angel to tell him that Caritas is a suitable location for Darla to deliver. As a storm brews, the expecting vampire parents arrive at the club. As Darla is taken back to Lorne's bedroom, Fred notices blood on the seat the female vampire vacates. A fired construction worker from Caritas reports to Holtz, recounting what he overheard at the bar. While Darla rests, Wesley tells Angel of the danger the baby is in and that Darla's dead body isn't meant to deliver the child; a Caesarean section is impossible due to the forces protecting Darla. Distraught that his son is dying, Angel doesn't want anything to happen to Darla or the child and doesn't want to accept that the child could be evil. Gunn offers some brutal honesty, which upsets Angel even more, but when Cordy tries to slap him for it, the violence barrier finally works. Angel tries to encourage Darla to keep fighting despite the weakening life force within her. Holtz arrives at the bar and starts to sing as he leaves which alerts Lorne to the future danger and he encourages everyone to get out, fast. A barrel of explosives and a grenade roll down the stairs entering the club and send the place up in flames. With the spell having no effect on explosives that didn't start inside of the club, the gang run downstairs and escapes through a passage hidden in Lorne's bedroom. Darla is finally told about Holtz's return and recalls all she and Angelus did to hurt the man. She suspects that Holtz was probably brought back for revenge, and both Darla and Angel, as parents whose child is dying, realize the irony. Outside, Darla collapses in the alleyway. Admitting that creating life with Angel was the only good thing they ever did together, Darla makes sure Angel will relay that to their child before she stakes herself through the heart, sacrificing her life for the baby. Darla turns to dust, but the baby remains, leaving Angel in shock over Darla's sacrifice before his fascination with his son's birth. Angel picks their child up, wrapping him in his coat. Immediately after his son is brought into the world, Holtz is there with a crossbow pointed at Angel and others surround the vampire and Fred. After seeing Angel's love for his newborn son, Holtz chooses to let them go, and Sahjhan is appalled until Holtz states that he intends to keep his promise of showing no mercy towards Angel. Production David Boreanaz became a father in real life several months after the filming of this episode. \\"My son is not going to be in that environment,\\" he says. \\"He won't have broadswords hanging in the cabinet.\\" =Arc significance= * Darla sacrifices herself so that her son, Connor, may be born. Connor will remain at the center of the storyline involving Sahjhan and Holtz this season. * This is the last episode that Caritas is seen. Lorne moves into the Hotel after it is destroyed a third time. The first was by Angel's car in the season 2 finale There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb, the second was by Gio and his gang in \\"That Old Gang of Mine,\\" and now by Holtz. Reception Actress Julie Benz was delighted with how Darla's life ended. She says. \\"I really think it was one of the most beautiful gifts I‚Äôve ever received as an actor. The last three episodes of her life are so wonderful. They were such a gift to play. It was really amazing.\\" Benz felt this episode gave closure to the relationship between Darla and Angel.

With three major water systems (Croton, Catskill, and Delaware) stretching up to away from the city, its water supply system is one of the most extensive municipal water systems in the world. New York's water treatment process is simpler than most other American cities. This largely reflects how well-protected its watersheds are. The city has sought to restrict development surrounding them. One of its largest watershed protection programs is the Land Acquisition Program, under which the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has purchased or protected, through conservation easement, over 130,000 acres (53,000 ha) since 1997. With all the care given, the city's water supply system is exempted from filtration requirements by both the federal and the state government, saving more than \\"$10 billion to build a massive filtration plant, and at least another $100 million annually on its operation\\". Moreover, the special topography the waterways run on allows 95% of the system's water to be supplied by gravity. The percentage of pumped water does change when the water level in the reservoirs is out of the normal range. History =Early years= A 1798 watercolor of Collect Pond. Bayard's Mount, a hillock, is in the left foreground. Prior to being levelled around 1811 it was located near the current intersection of Mott and Grand Streets. New York City, which then extended to a stockade which ran approximately north‚Äìsoutheast from today's Chambers Street and Broadway, is visible beyond the southern shore. Until the eighteenth century, New York City solely depended on primitive means such as wells and rainwater reservoirs to collect water for daily use. The first public well was dug in Bowling Green, New York, in 1677, and the first reservoir was built on the east side of New York in 1776 after the population grew up to 22,000. Collect Pond, or \\"Fresh Water Pond\\",Jackson, Kenneth T., ed. (1995), The Encyclopedia of New York City, New Haven: Yale University Press, , p. 250. was a body of fresh water in what is now Chinatown in Lower Manhattan. For the first two centuries of European settlement in Manhattan, it was the main water supply system for the growing city. Later, the City was aware of its deteriorated water quality, owing to its rapid population growth (60,000 to 200,000 from 1800 to 1830), which had a considerable danger of causing epidemics. In April 1831, a new water supply and distribution system opened, for fighting fires. It included a well and cistern on 13th Street between Bowery (today 4th Avenue) and Third Avenue, which was then at the northern fringes of the city. The well was immense‚Äî16 feet across and 112 feet deep‚Äîblasted largely through rock, resulting in a quarry of over 175,000 gallons of water. A steam engine had the capacity to lift nearly half a million gallons a day. An octagonal iron tank, 43 feet in diameter and 20 feet high was installed atop a 27-foot high stone tower. Mains under Broadway and the Bowery delivered the water to hydrants on Pearl, William, Hudson, and a dozen other major streets, in six-, ten-, and 12-inch pipes, delivering water to a height of 60 feet above the highest streets. The Old Croton Aqueduct was established in 1842, and apart from a few inspections during the Civil War era the system has been running unceasingly ever since.. In the late 1800s, Additional aqueducts were systematically installed in New York City to fit the demand. =Old and New Croton Aqueducts= In 1842, the City's first aqueduct, the Croton Aqueduct, was built from the Croton River along a section within Westchester County, down to Manhattan. According to New York City‚Äôs website, the Old Croton Aqueduct's capacity was around 90 million gallons per day. To meet growing needs, the New Croton Aqueduct project was launched in 1885 and established in 1890, running with a capacity of 300 million gallons per day. =Catskill Aqueduct= In 1905, the City's newly-established Board of Water Supply launched the Catskill Aqueduct project, which would play an additional role in supplying the City's ever-growing population of residents and visitors. In 1915, Ashokan Reservoir and Catskill Aqueduct were established. As the additions to the original, Schoharie Reservoir and Shandaken Tunnel was put into use 13 years later in 1928. The Catskill System has an operational capacity of approximately 850 million gallons per day. To be noted, Catskill aqueduct is the furthest away from the City in the water system. The distance is approximately 125 miles. =Delaware Aqueduct= The Board of Water Supply submitted a request to the Board of Estimate and Apportionment in 1927 to use the Delaware River as an additional water source for New York City. Even though the request was approved, the Delaware Aqueduct project was delayed due to a Supreme Court case filed by the State of New Jersey to prevent the State of New York from using the Delaware River as a water source. New York won the case in May 1931 and construction of the Delaware Aqueduct was initiated in March 1937. The Aqueduct was completed in 1944 and from 1950 to 1964, Rondout, Neversink, Pepacton, and Cannonsville Reservoirs were established successively to complete the Delaware System. The Delaware Aqueduct supports half of the whole City's water usage by supplying more than 500 million gallons of water daily.  Responsible agencies  Responsibility for the city water supply is shared among three institutions: the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (\\"DEP\\"), which operates and maintains the system and is responsible for investment planning; the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority (\\"NYW\\"), which raises debt financing in the market to underwrite the system's costs; and the Water Board, which sets rates and collects user payments. =New York City Department of Environmental Protection= The DEP has a workforce of over 7,000 employees. It includes three bureaus in charge of, respectively, the upstate water supply system, New York City's water and sewer operations, and wastewater treatment: * The Bureau of Water Supply manages, operates, and protects New York City's upstate water supply system to ensure the delivery of a sufficient quantity of high quality drinking water. The Bureau is also responsible for the overall management and implementation of the city's $1.5 billion Watershed Protection Program. * The Bureau of Water and Sewer Operations operates and maintains the water supply and sewerage system. It is also responsible for the operation of the Staten Island Bluebelt, a natural alternative to storm sewers, which occupies approximately of land in the South Richmond area of Staten Island. This project preserves streams, ponds and other wetland (\\"bluebelt\\") areas, allowing them to perform their natural function of conveying, storing and filtering storm water. * The Bureau of Wastewater Treatment operates 14 water pollution control plants treating an average of of wastewater a day; 95 wastewater pump stations; eight dewatering facilities; 490 sewer regulators; and of intercepting sewers. =New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority= The NYW finances the capital needs of the water and sewer system of the city through the issuance of bonds, commercial paper, and other debt instruments. It is a public-benefit corporation created in 1985 pursuant to the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority Act. The Authority is administered by a seven-member Board of Directors. Four of the members are ex officio members: the Commissioner of Environmental Protection of the City, the Director of Management and Budget of the City, the Commissioner of Finance of the City, and the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation of the State. The remaining three members are public appointments: two by the Mayor, and one by the Governor. =New York City Water Board= The New York City Water Board was established in 1905. It sets water and sewer rates for New York City sufficient to pay the costs of operating and financing the system, and collects user payments from customers for services provided by the water and wastewater utility systems of the City of New York. The five Board members are appointed to two-year terms by the Mayor.  Infrastructure  New York City's water system consists of aqueducts, distribution pipes, reservoirs, and water tunnels that channel drinking water to residents and visitors. A comprehensive raised-relief map of the system is on display at the Queens Museum of Art. Until the early 21st century, some places in southeastern Queens received their water from local wells of the former Jamaica Water Supply Company. = Reservoirs and aqueducts = The water system has a storage capacity of and provides over per day of drinking water to more than eight million city residents, and another one million users in four upstate counties bordering on the system. Three separate sub-systems, each consisting of aqueducts and reservoirs, bring water from Upstate New York to New York City: * The New Croton Aqueduct, completed in 1890, brings water from the New Croton Reservoir in Westchester and Putnam counties. * The Catskill Aqueduct, completed in 1916, is significantly larger than New Croton and brings water from two reservoirs in the eastern Catskill Mountains. * The Delaware Aqueduct, completed in 1945, taps tributaries of the Delaware River in the western Catskill Mountains and provides approximately half of New York City's water supply. The latter two aqueducts provide 90% of New York City's drinking water, and the watershed for these aqueducts extends a combined . Two-fifths of the watershed is owned by the New York City, state, or local governments, or by private conservancies. The rest of the watershed is private property that is closely monitored for pollutants; development upon this land is restricted. The DEP has purchased or protected over of private land since 1997 through its Land Acquisition Program. Water from both aqueducts is stored first in the large Kensico Reservoir and subsequently in the much smaller Hillview Reservoir closer to the city. The water is monitored by robotic buoys that measure temperature as well as pH, nutrient, and microbial levels in the reservoirs. A computer system then analyzes the measurements and makes predictions for the water quality. In 2015, the buoys took 1.9 million measurements of the water in the reservoirs. = Disinfection and filtration = The water from the reservoirs flows down to the Catskill- Delaware Water Ultraviolet Disinfection Facility, located in Westchester. The facility was built because chlorinated water might have unintended side effects when mixed with certain organic compounds, and ultraviolet was seen as the least risky way to clean the water of any microorganisms. The UV facility opened on October 8, 2013, and was built at a cost of $1.6 billion. The compound is the largest ultraviolet germicidal irradiation plant in the world; it contains 56 UV reactors that could treat per day. While all the water goes through the disinfectant process, only 10% of the water is filtered. The Croton Filtration Plant, which was completed in 2015 at a cost of over $3 billion, was built under Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx and filters water from the Croton River. The plant, which is bigger than Yankee Stadium, is New York City's first water filtration plant. It was built after a 1998 lawsuit by the presidential administration of Bill Clinton, which Mayor Rudy Giuliani settled under the condition that the city of New York would build the plant by 2006. The city had been studying possible sites for such a plant for more than 20 years in both the Bronx and Westchester. = Tunnels and distribution system = Tunnels From the Hillview reservoir water flows by gravity to three tunnels under New York City. Water rises again to the surface under natural pressure, through a number of shafts. The three tunnels are: #New York City Water Tunnel No. 1, completed in 1917. It runs from the Hillview Reservoir under the central Bronx, Harlem River, West Side, Midtown, and Lower East Side of Manhattan, and under the East River to Brooklyn where it connects to Tunnel 2. It is expected to undergo extensive repairs upon completion of Tunnel No. 3, in 2020. #New York City Water Tunnel No. 2, completed in 1935. It runs from the Hillview Reservoir under the central Bronx, East River, and western Queens to Brooklyn, where it connects to Tunnel 1 and the Richmond Tunnel to Staten Island. When completed, it was the longest large diameter water tunnel in the world. #The uncompleted New York City Water Tunnel No. 3, the largest capital construction project in New York City's history (see below). It starts at Hillview Reservoir in Yonkers, New York then crosses under Central Park in Manhattan, to reach Fifth Avenue at 78th Street. From there it runs under the East River and Roosevelt Island into Astoria, Queens. From there it will continue on to Brooklyn. Distribution The distribution system is made up of an extensive grid of water mains stretching approximately . , it costs the city $140 million to maintain these mains. There are 965 water sampling stations in New York City. The water-sampling system has been in use since 1997. They consist of small cast-iron boxes with spigots inside them, raised above the ground. Scientists from the city measure water from 50 stations every day. The samples are then tested for microorganisms, toxic chemicals, and other contaminants that could potentially harm users of the water supply system. In 2015, the DEP performed 383,000 tests on 31,700 water samples. Ongoing repairs and upgrades In order to comply with federal and state laws regarding the filtration and disinfection of drinking water, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the New York State Department of Health called on the city to create a treatment plan to serve the Croton System. The underground filtration plant is under construction in Van Cortlandt Park. While the Bloomberg administration originally budgeted the project at $992 million in 2003, an audit by the city's comptroller placed the actual costs at $2.1 billion in August 2009. In 2008, the New York City water supply system was leaking at a rate of up to per day. A complex five-year project with an estimated $240 million construction cost was initiated in November 2008, to correct some of this leakage. The construction of Water tunnel No. 3 is intended to provide the city with a critical third connection to its Upstate New York water supply system so that the city can, for the first time, close tunnels No. 1 and No. 2 for repair. The tunnel will eventually be more than long. Construction on the tunnel began in 1970, and its first and second phases are completed. The latter opened with a ceremony under Central Park, in 2013. Completion of all phases is not expected until at least 2020. In 2018, New York City announced a US$1 billion investment to protect the integrity of its municipal water system and to maintain the purity of its unfiltered water supply. A significant portion of the investment will be used to prevent the turbidity that might be caused by climate change, including relocating the residents and cleaning up decaying plantations near the watersheds, and conducting flood-preventing research for infrastructures near the watersheds. According to Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council: \\"This is no time to let down one‚Äôs guard\\".

This issue escalated while he was on a political trip to the United States and on 9 January 1964 riots broke out across the country that left at least 25 people dead including three U.S. soldiers. Biography Born in Fort Robinson in Nebraska on January 13, 1907 to Augusta and Robert John Fleming. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, graduating in 1928 before earning an M.S. in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1931. He remained in the United States Army as an engineering officer until 1954, his World War II service including duty in the Pacific Theater before a series of staff posts in Washington D.C. and Virginia. After a period in public service that included a three-year sojourn in public service in France, Fleming was appointed by President John F. Kennedy as Governor of the Panama Canal Zone in 1962. In 1964 Fleming watered down a directive issued by Kennedy stipulating that the Panamanian national flag should be flown alongside that of the American flag on public buildings within the zone. Fleming, in an effort to defuse the tensions caused by this ruling, changed it so that no flags would be flown. This move angered more people than the previous one, and when Fleming was on board a flight over the Caribbean, students at Balboa high school raised the American flag over their school and resisted efforts to either remove it or add the Panamanian one alongside. From these beginnings began a riot partly caused by the over-reaction of the local Zonian police who were without guidance from the Governor's office on how to proceed. The army were eventually called in to calm the situation, but not before 25 people were dead. This is now known as Martyr's Day in Panama and is a public holiday. Fleming was not held responsible for the events and remained in place until 1967 when he retired to take up a position as Executive Vice President for a company in Boston, Massachusetts. His tenure in charge had also seen the most comprehensive survey of the canal with the intention of widening it, the inauguration of the Panama Canal Spillway newspaper and the opening of the Thatcher Ferry Bridge. He died on the July 14, 1984. Awards and decorations His years of military and public service came with several awards. He was given the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, the Army Commendation Medal, the Order of the White Lion from Czechoslovakia, the L√©gion d'honneur from France and the Grand Cross Nu√±ez de Balboa from Panama for his various and varied public services.

Written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, it was originally broadcast on February 4, 2002 on the WB network. In \\"Waiting in the Wings\\", Angel takes the gang out for an evening at the ballet but becomes suspicious when the prima ballerina (Summer Glau) is the same one he saw dance more than 100 years ago. When Cordelia and Angel sneak backstage to investigate, they are consumed by overwhelming passion for each other as they are possessed by spirits of unrequited ballet lovers held captive by the sinister ballet troupe leader. Also, Fred finds that both Wesley and Gunn have feelings for her too, but she must eventually choose one of them. Plot Wesley researches a demon from one of Cordelia's visions while Cordelia questions Wesley about his romantic feelings towards Fred. After Gunn and Fred return from breakfast, Angel announces he is taking them all to a ballet production of Giselle, by the same company he witnessed perform in 1890. At the theater, the company's owner, Count Kurskov, promises the theater manager an unforgettable show while a shadowed figure watches from above the stage and laughs. In preparation for their glamorous night at the ballet, Fred and Cordelia shop for new dresses, which they intend to return after wearing them for the night. Subtly, Cordelia broaches the subject of Fred's romantic interests, but Cordelia thinks Fred's mind is on Wesley, when it's really on Gunn. Compliments are directed to everyone as their attire is revealed at the hotel, and they depart together. At the theater, Cordelia is literally bored to sleep while the others enjoy the show. Angel finds the dancers familiar since he saw the same people perform the first time he saw the show. During intermission, Angel tells his friends about his revelation. He and Cordelia sneak backstage to investigate, where they discover they are mystically trapped in a maze of corridors. Looking through the prima ballerina's dressing room, Angel observes that the dressing room hasn't changed in two hundred years as Cordelia examines a cross necklace from a table. Both feel the room warm, and Cordelia suddenly asks Angel to undress her. Soon they find themselves possessed by spirits in love and are unable to keep their hands off each other, until Cordelia accidentally burns Angel with the cross. Both come to their senses and leave the dressing room before things go too far. Worried, Fred encourages the guys to help her look for the missing Angel and Cordelia. The Count directs his demon minions to deal with those sneaking around backstage. While trying to escape the backstage halls, Cordelia recalls an element of fear she felt while possessed. She convinces Angel to reenter the dressing room so that they can break the spell holding them backstage, where they are possessed by the spirits again with wild passion for each other. Cordelia calls Angel \\"Stefan\\" and confesses her fears of another man who is controlling her life. They kiss, and \\"Stefan\\" offers to take her away, but she wants him to help her deal with the problem instead. As Fred tends to a wound Gunn received in the battle with the Count's minions, he jokes about his injury, and Fred gets emotional because she thought he was seriously hurt. The two kiss as Wesley quietly discovers them and walks away sadly. The ballet continues on stage as the gang gathers backstage. Wesley explains that the Count was a wizard who discovered the prima ballerina whom he adored had a lover. To repay her for her betrayal, the count forced her into a temporal shift where she would dance for only him, forever. As Angel searches for the Count's power center, he finds the prima ballerina waiting in the wings, resigned to perform the same dance for the rest of eternity. Angel tells her to break the magic holding her prisoner, she has to change the dance. She dances on stage using her own steps. Angel attacks the Count and, guessing the power center is in a medallion the count wears, smashes it with a powerful punch, finally releasing the ballet dancers. Wesley dresses Gunn's injury and watches on in emotional agony as Fred and Gunn exchange loving looks. Angel and Cordelia agree that they are embarrassed about what happened between them while they were possessed. As Angel is about to declare his feelings for Cordelia, the Groosalugg from Pylea appears on the stairs, drawing Cordelia's attention. Groo and Cordelia kiss as Lorne comes downstairs to inform Angel that Pylea has formed a republic; with no need for a monarch, Groo returned for his true love, Cordelia. Angel goes upstairs to check on Connor while Fred and Wesley watch on. Wesley realizes the path of love is not something that can be foretold. Production In the DVD commentary, writer/director Joss Whedon revealed that the main impetus for this episode was learning that Amy Acker danced ballet for fifteen years, although he also was excited to see the group dressed up. Whedon filmed a scene in which Amy Acker and Alexis Denisof dance in the ballet. The scene, which was ultimately cut, was a fantasy of Wesley's during the performance. In the scene, Amy Acker - who danced fifteen years - dances properly, while Alexis Denisof dances farcically.Whedon, Joss, \\"Waiting in the Wings (Commentary with Joss Whedon). Angel: Season Three on DVD, Twentieth Century Fox, 2003. The scene is included on the DVD as a bonus feature.\\"Deleted Scene With Optional Commentary by Joss Whedon\\", Angel: Season Three on DVD, Twentieth Century Fox, 2003. This episode was shot on location at the Orpheum Theater in downtown Los Angeles. =Acting= This episode features Summer Glau in her first acting role as a Prima Ballerina cursed to carry out the same performance over and over again. Glau, who is also a classically trained ballerina, would go on to star in Angel co-creator Joss Whedon's Firefly later that year as River Tam, and later have a recurring role in his show Dollhouse. Reception In her essay examining the maturation of Wesley's character over time, Stacey Abbott writes, \\"Denisof delivers a fearless comedic performance as he...prances across the stage with little grace and elegance\\", undercutting the romantic atmosphere of the ballet - which ultimately resulted in the scene being cut to maintain the more serious tone of the episode.

Plot synopsis At her apartment, Cordelia changes into something comfortable while Groo explains how he was dethroned in Pylea. They kiss, but after Cordelia sees a demon in Groo's place as a vision painlessly hits her, she's no longer in the mood. The next morning, Angel carries Connor around and talks with Wesley about investigating prophecies about Connor. Cordelia arrives with Groo in tow. She informs them about the demon from her vision and that it will be surfacing later that day. When the topic returns to Cordelia's lack of a sex life, she tells her friends about her worry of losing her visions to Groo if they did actually have sex. Meanwhile, Gunn and Fred have breakfast together and talk. As they lean in for a kiss, their beepers go off with calls from Wesley. While a picture of the demon, a Senih'd, is passed around, Wesley explains the plan. As Groo raises the subject of Cordelia's obvious sadness, Angel explains Cordelia's fear of losing something if she gets too close to Groo. Following a trail of blood, the two demon hunters find the demon and battle with it. The Senih'd breaks through a wall into the daylight, and only Groo can follow to destroy it. Cordelia and the others arrive just in time to congratulate him. While Groo recounts his battle to the others, Angel talks with a Ms. Frakes about investigating a witch who is supposedly seducing her fianc√©. Wesley assigns the job to Gunn, but Fred tags along too, much to Wesley's dismay. Wesley and Angel go to a bookstore for a supposedly rare text of commentaries on the scrolls about Connor. Back at the office, Groo agrees to let Cordelia give him a complete makeover, thinking that it will make her love him more. She explains that she already has strong feelings for him, and he then understands Cordelia is concerned about losing her visions. Jerry, the fianc√©, is tailed by Gunn and Fred who videotape the man as he waits beside a large tree. The two start kissing and distractedly miss the moment when Jerry disappears. Cordelia asks Angel for the favor of escorting Groo to a demon brothel where a magic potion is held which will allow her to have sex with Groo without losing her visions. Gunn and Fred refer to the videotape for evidence of Jerry's disappearance and watch him get sucked into the ground by the tree's roots a few seconds before they're sucked down as well. At the brothel, Angel and Groo follow Anita past tempting sights into a room where cash is exchanged for the potion. When Anita questions Angel's presence there, he gets a phone call from Gunn and Fred who are bound by tree roots underground. They explain that it is a living flesh tree with an internet connection which lures victims in order to suck the life out of them. Naturally, they avoid contacting Wesley and instead request the Groosalugg. Before reaching the underground spot where Gunn and Fred are held, Groo has Angel keep the potion safe and then rushes into battle, despite Angel's suggestions. The tree quickly sticks one of its fleshy roots deep into Groo's chest. The tree gets stronger as it feeds on Groo, so Angel questions the tree as he pounds Groo into unconsciousness. The tree impales Angel instead, and suddenly the tree begins to die as it feeds off of Angel's dead heart. The others break free, and Gunn finishes the tree demon off. Later that night, Wesley talks with Ms. Frakes on the phone, confirming that Jerry survived. Fred goes to get cleaned up while Gunn stays to talk with Wesley. Wesley expresses his concern for Fred and her feelings and although it takes a few moments, Gunn realizes the real reason for Wesley's worry. Cordelia tends to Groo's wounds, and Groo confesses his reckless behavior earlier that evening, but Cordy is only turned on more by his honesty. Eager for sex, Cordelia is about to rush out, when Angel stops her. He insists that she accept some money he has saved up so that she can take a sunny vacation with Groo. Lorne lays Connor down for bed and as soon as Angel arrives, leaves him to be alone with his son. Angel carries Connor downstairs and finds Wesley working in the office. As the two leave, Wesley looks down on his notepad where he has translated, \\"The Father will kill The Son.\\" Writing =Arc significance= *Wesley translates the text that will become pivotal in the future. \\"The Father Will Kill the Son\\" will lead Wes to eventually betray Angel and kidnap Connor. *Cordelia and the Groosalugg depart in this episode, and will not appear again until Double or Nothing. =Continuity= *During the teaser, Groosalugg is describing how he got deposed.

Plot synopsis Gunn and Fred arrive at the office to find Wesley asleep at his desk and wake him as they try to touch the papers he's been working with. Angel cheerfully comments about teaching Connor to die before he vamps and leans in to bite his son while the others watch on. Wesley sees his hands coated with blood against the book, and then he wakes up. Angel and Wesley take Connor to the doctor and while in the waiting room, Angel offers advice to some of the mothers waiting there. During the examination, the doctor informs Angel that his son is healthy and blood tests should be returned within the week to confirm nothing is wrong. After the room is cleared, one of the women from the waiting room enters and exchanges Connor's blood sample with a fake before a nurse discovers her.

Angel and Gunn play hockey together until Angel breaks a window with the puck. A woman in need of help, Aubrey, comes to Angel Investigations about her son who had run away and been turned into a vampire. Aubrey returns to Holtz, Justine and others, reporting back on the members of the Angel Investigations team. Human members of Holtz's team practice fighting vampires that are chained up in the hideaway. Sahjhan appears and questions the progress of Holtz's efforts to kill Angel. Holtz, however, refuses to speed up his timetable and isn't remotely concerned by Sahjhan's threats because he is immaterial and Holtz happens to be in possession of a special urn that can contain his essence. Sahjhan isn't happy, but leaves. Wesley talks on the phone with a wizard and directs him to do his job for the money he was paid. Fred shows up and suggests that Wesley hook up with Aubrey, but Wesley brushes it off and says the job is their purpose, not dating. Lilah talks with her sick mother on the phone until, Sahjhan shows up at Wolfram & Hart in Lilah's office. She is not shocked to see him, and she knows quite a bit about him already, right down to his need for the law firm's help in destroying Angel. Lilah states that she won't go against firm policy which is to keep Angel alive, but she writes on a piece of paper that he has her support. Sahjhan explains that he needs Connor's blood, and Lilah surprises him by explaining that it's already possessed by the firm since they stole it from the hospital where Connor was cared for. At a carnival on the pier, Fred tries to concentrate on work while Gunn is more interested in playing around and spending time with her. Wesley's knowledge of their relationship is discussed, and Gunn finds out that Wesley said something to Fred that led her to question the appropriateness of their relationship. Upset by that, he stresses that he won't let Wesley impede his efforts at a good personal and working relationship with Fred. Wesley drops in to check on the two of them. The vampire drinks from a glass of blood while his attention is divided between his son and his friend. Looking troubled, Wesley leaves for a little while. Back at the carnival, Fred spots a man breaking into a building and Gunn leads the way to follow him. Inside the building is a carousel, which turns on and as Gunn prepares for battle, he and Fred suddenly find themselves completely surrounded by vampires. Holtz's prot√©g√©, Justine, films the events with a man at her side. Fred runs away at Gunn's insistence and he takes all of the vampires on alone. Justine and the man watch, commenting on Gunn's chance at survival. Gunn holds his own for a short while before he's grabbed by a vampire and Fred returns in time to stake the vampire and save Gunn. As Justine and her friend depart, Gunn and Fred appreciate that they're both alive. Wesley follows a GPS unit to a precise location where he finds a hamburger-shaped speaker outside of a fast-food restaurant. He performs a ritual, calling on Alegba, and the plastic cartoonish hamburger comes to life. The Loa, as Wesley calls it, confirms his suspicion that Angel will \\"devour\\" his son and informs him that the prophecy cannot be stopped. It predicts a future of betrayal and agony for Wesley. The Loa finally reveals that when the earth shakes, the air burns and the sky turns to blood, the prophecy will come true. Lilah meets Sahjhan at a bar and ignores Sahjhan's attempts at small talk, informing him that arrangements have been made to deal with their Angel problem. Aubrey returns to the office and thanks Wesley for his help in destroying the monsters. Wesley is thrown by her identification of \\"monsters\\" and accepts her check in return for their services. She tries to come onto him and Wesley calls her on her attempt to play him. Angel appears behind her and makes it clear that he knows who she's working for and that no one will be harming Connor. As she runs away, a small earthquake shakes the ground and Wesley realizes that the first portent has come true. Holtz directs the humans to study the video of Fred and Gunn by the carousel. Aubrey returns, but much to her surprise, Wesley has followed her. Wesley explains that he is there in peace and tries to persuade Holtz that Angel is not the same vampire as Angelus. Holtz knows too much pain at Angelus's hands to care about the difference; he also knows why Wesley is there and suggests he prepare for what he'll feel when Connor is killed. Gunn and Fred have their regular meal together and talk about how right their relationship really is. He is worried that they can't do so many things at once and is worried about the consequences if things don't work out. She wonders what his decision would be if he had to choose between her and work, and he admits to choosing her. Wesley finds Angel with Connor in his room, preparing a meal for his child. They talk about Aubrey and her reasons for joining with Holtz and Angel's unconditional love for Connor. Wesley realizes that Angel would never harm his son, and finally feeling released from the prophecy, begins to laugh at the oddity that is life, and then a powerful earthquake begins to shake all of Los Angeles. The room goes up in flames as the gas stove explodes and beams come down from the ceiling. Angel rescues Connor and gets all three of them out of the room. A large cut on his forehead drips blood onto Connor's blanket, which is patterned with a blue sky and clouds. As the third of the portents comes true, Angel smiles and comments that if they had been trapped in there, he would have had a snack. Wesley, who a few seconds ago had dismissed the prophecy, is left more paranoid than ever.

As the battle ensues, Lorne wakes up and uses a high-pitched note to debilitate some of the attackers. Holtz and some of his men retreat, and Lorne reveals that Wesley has been seeing Holtz and has kidnapped Connor.

Numerical algorithms which calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix give only approximate results due to rounding and other errors. These errors can be described with the matrix E.

Plot synopsis Shortly after Daniel Holtz's abduction of baby Connor to the Hell dimension of Quor'Toth, Fred, Gunn and Lorne try to sort out why Wesley betrayed them and how to get Connor back. Angel is not interested in sympathy or pity, however, and is already mentally unbalanced and vengeful due to his loss. When it proves impossible to open a portal to Quor'Toth, he abducts Linwood, a lawyer with Wolfram & Hart, to force him to tell where Sahjhan is and how to open a dimensional rift to Quor'Toth. In an attempt to open a rift, Angel and Lilah use dark magic; this opens a tear in the fabric of reality. Sahjhan is revealed to have been a demon knight who had been made non- corporeal by an ancient curse hundreds of years ago, and who is now able to wander through time at will. When Sahjhan uncovered a prophecy that he would be killed by ‚Äòthe one sired by a vampire with a soul‚Äô he brought vampire hunter and Angel's old nemesis Daniel Holtz to the 21st century to kill Angel, Darla and the baby. However, Holtz did not follow Sahjhan's plan, so Sahjhan, using his time-shifting abilities, altered the prophecy to trick Wesley into believing that Angel would kill Connor. In the final confrontation, Angel makes Sahjhan corporeal once again to fight him, but discovers that he is more physically powerful than any of them had anticipated. Justine ends up trapping him in a special urn that Holtz had obtained previously. Wesley is later found and taken to a hospital. Angel pays him a visit, saying he would never kill his own son. He tells Wesley it's important that he knows it's not Angelus talking, but Angel. When Wesley nods, Angel simply says \\"good\\" then suddenly grabs a pillow and tries to smother Wesley with it. Filled with fury and rage, Angel screams that he will never forgive his former friend, and that he'll kill him for stealing his son.

During such drilling, data is acquired from the drilling rig sensors for a range of purposes such as: decision-support to monitor and manage the smooth operation of drilling; to make detailed records (or well log) of the geologic formations penetrated by a borehole; to generate operations statistics and performance benchmarks such that improvements can be identified, and to provide well planners with accurate historical operations- performance data with which to perform statistical risk analysis for future well operations. The terms measurement while drilling (MWD), and logging while drilling (LWD) are not used consistently throughout the industry. Although these terms are related, within the context of this section, the term MWD refers to directional-drilling measurements, e.g., for decision support for the wellbore path, (Inclination and Azimuth) while LWD refers to measurements concerning the geological formations penetrated while drilling. History Initial attempts to provide MWD and LWD date back to the 1920s, and attempts were made prior to WW2 with mud pulse, wired pipe, acoustic and electromagnetics. JJ Arps produced a working directional and resistivity system in the 1960s.J.J. Arps  J.L. Arps DOI https://doi.org/10.2118/710-PA Competing work supported by Mobil, Standard Oil and others in the late 1960s and early 1970s led to multiple viable systems by the early 1970s, with the MWD of Teleco Oilfield Services, systems from Schlumberger (Mobil) Halliburton and BakerHughes. However the main impetus to development was a decision by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate to mandate the taking of a directional survey in wells offshore Norway every 100 meters. This decision created an environment where MWD technology had an economic advantage over conventional mechanical TOTCO devices, and lead to rapid developments, including LWD, to add gamma and resistivity, by the early 1980s.http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-90/issue-7/in-this- issue/general-interest/advances-in-mwd-technology-improve-real-time- data.htmlhttps://www.onepetro.org/journal-paper/SPE-10053-PA https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS Measurement MWD typically concerns measurement taken of the wellbore (the hole) inclination from vertical, and also magnetic direction from north. Using basic trigonometry, a three-dimensional plot of the path of the well can be produced. Essentially, a MWD operator measures the trajectory of the hole as it is drilled (for example, data updates arrive and are processed every few seconds or faster). This information is then used to drill in a pre-planned direction into the formation which contains the oil, gas, water or condensate. Additional measurements can also be taken of natural gamma ray emissions from the rock; this helps broadly to determine what type of rock formation is being drilled, which in turn helps confirm the real-time location of the wellbore in relation to the presence of different types of known formations (by comparison with existing seismic data). Density and porosity, rock fluid pressures and other measurements are taken, some using radioactive sources, some using sound, some using electricity, etc.; this can then be used to calculate how freely oil and other fluids can flow through the formation, as well as the volume of hydrocarbons present in the rock and, with other data, the value of the whole reservoir and reservoir reserves. An MWD downhole tool is also \\"high-sided\\" with the bottom hole drilling assembly, enabling the wellbore to be steered in a chosen direction in 3D space known as directional drilling. Directional drillers rely on receiving accurate, quality tested data from the MWD operator to allow them to keep the well safely on the planned trajectory. Directional survey measurements are taken by three orthogonally mounted accelerometers to measure inclination, and three orthogonally mounted magnetometers which measure direction (azimuth). Gyroscopic tools may be used to measure azimuth where the survey is measured in a location with disruptive external magnetic influences, inside \\"casing\\", for example, where the hole is lined with steel tubulars (tubes). These sensors, as well as any additional sensors to measure rock formation density, porosity, pressure or other data, are connected, physically and digitally, to a logic unit which converts the information into binary digits which are then transmitted to surface using \\"mud pulse telemetry\\" (MPT, a binary coding transmission system used with fluids, such as, combinatorial, Manchester encoding, split-phase, among others). This is done by using a downhole \\"pulser\\" unit which varies the drilling fluid (mud) pressure inside the drillstring according to the chosen MPT: these pressure fluctuations are decoded and displayed on the surface system computers as wave-forms; voltage outputs from the sensors (raw data); specific measurements of gravity or directions from magnetic north, or in other forms, such as sound waves, nuclear wave-forms, etc. Surface (mud) pressure transducers measure these pressure fluctuations (pulses) and pass an analogue voltage signal to surface computers which digitize the signal. Disruptive frequencies are filtered out and the signal is decoded back into its original data form. For example, a pressure fluctuation of 20psi (or less) can be ‚Äúpicked out‚Äù of a total mud system pressure of 3,500psi or more. Downhole electrical and mechanical power is provided by downhole turbine systems, which use the energy of the ‚Äúmud‚Äù flow, battery units (lithium), or a combination of both. Types of information transmitted =Directional information= MWD tools are generally capable of taking directional surveys in real time. The tool uses accelerometers and magnetometers to measure the inclination and azimuth of the wellbore at that location, and they then transmit that information to the surface. With a series of surveys; measurements of inclination, azimuth, and tool face, at appropriate intervals (anywhere from every 30 ft (i.e., 10m) to every 500 ft), the location of the wellbore can be calculated. By itself, this information allows operators to prove that their well does not cross into areas that they are not authorized to drill. However, due to the cost of MWD systems, they are not generally used on wells intended to be vertical. Instead, the wells are surveyed after drilling through the use of multi-shot surveying tools lowered into the drillstring on slickline or wireline. The primary use of real-time surveys is in directional drilling. For the directional driller to steer the well towards a target zone, he must know where the well is going, and what the effects of his steering efforts are. MWD tools also generally provide toolface measurements to aid in directional drilling using downhole mud motors with bent subs or bent housings. For more information on the use of toolface measurements, see Directional drilling. =Drilling mechanics information= MWD tools can also provide information about the conditions at the drill bit. This may include: *Rotational speed of the drillstring *Smoothness of that rotation *Type and severity of any vibration downhole *Downhole temperature *Torque and weight on bit, measured near the drill bit *Mud flow volume Mud Motors Use of this information can allow the operator to drill the well more efficiently, and to ensure that the MWD tool and any other downhole tools, such as a mud motor, rotary steerable systems, and LWD tools, are operated within their technical specifications to prevent tool failure. This information is also valuable to geologists responsible for the well information about the formation which is being drilled. =Formation properties= Many MWD tools, either on their own, or in conjunction with separate LWD tools, can take measurements of formation properties. At the surface, these measurements are assembled into a log, similar to one obtained by wireline logging. LWD tools are able to measure a suite of geological characteristics including density, porosity, resistivity, acoustic-caliper, inclination at the drill bit (NBI), magnetic resonance and formation pressure. Taherdangkoo, R., & Abdideh, M. (2016). https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJPE.2016.084117. Fracture density estimation from well logs data using regression analysis: validation based on image logs (Case study: South West Iran). International Journal of Petroleum Engineering, 2(4), 289-301. The MWD tool allows these measurements to be taken and evaluated while the well is being drilled. This makes it possible to perform geosteering, or directional drilling based on measured formation properties, rather than simply drilling into a preset target. Most MWD tools contain an internal gamma ray sensor to measure natural gamma ray values. This is because these sensors are compact, inexpensive, reliable, and can take measurements through unmodified drill collars. Other measurements often require separate LWD tools, which communicate with the MWD tools downhole through internal wires. Measurement while drilling can be cost- effective in exploration wells, particularly in areas of the Gulf of Mexico where wells are drilled in areas of salt diapirs. The resistivity log will detect penetration into salt, and early detection prevents salt damage to bentonite drilling mud. Data transmission methods =Mud-pulse telemetry= This is the most common method of data transmission used by MWD tools. Downhole, a valve is operated to restrict the flow of the drilling fluid (mud) according to the digital information to be transmitted. This creates pressure fluctuations representing the information. The pressure fluctuations propagate within the drilling fluid towards the surface where they are received from pressure sensors. On the surface, the received pressure signals are processed by computers to reconstruct the information. The technology is available in three varieties: positive pulse, negative pulse, and continuous wave.https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS ;Positive pulse :Positive-pulse tools briefly close and open the valve to restrict the mud flow within the drill pipe. This produces an increase in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using line codes or pulse-position modulation.https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS Diagram showing the MWD ;Negative pulse :Negative pulse tools briefly open and close the valve to release mud from inside the drillpipe out to the annulus. This produces a decrease in pressure that can be seen at surface. The digital information can be encoded in the pressure signal using line codes or pulse- position modulation.https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-14071-MS ;Continuous wave :Continuous wave tools gradually close and open the valve to generate sinusoidal pressure fluctuations within the drilling fluid. Any digital modulation scheme with a continuous phase can be used to impose the information on a carrier signal. The most widely used modulation scheme is continuous phase modulation.https://www.onepetro.org/conference- paper/SPE-14071-MS When underbalanced drilling is used, mud pulse telemetry can become unusable. This is usually because, in order to reduce the equivalent density of the drilling mud, a compressible gas is injected into the mud. This causes high signal attenuation which drastically reduces the ability of the mud to transmit pulsed data. In this case, it is necessary to use methods different from mud pulse telemetry, such as electromagnetic waves propagating through the formation or wired drill pipe telemetry. Current mud- pulse telemetry technology offers a bandwidths of up to 40 bit/s. The data rate drops with increasing length of the wellbore and is typically as low as 0.5 bit/s ‚Äì 3.0 bit/s. (bits per second) at a depth of 35,000 ft ‚Äì 40,000 ft (10668 m ‚Äì 12192 m). Surface to down hole communication is typically done via changes to drilling parameters, i.e., change of the rotation speed of the drill string or change of the mud flow rate. Making changes to the drilling parameters in order to send information can require interruption of the drilling process, which is unfavorable due to the fact that it causes non- productive time. =Electromagnetic telemetry= These tools incorporate an electrical insulator in the drillstring, but due to the challenges of receiving data through a good conductor (Salt Water) this approach is largely confined to onshore areas without shallow saline aquifers. To transmit data, the tool generates an altered voltage difference between the top part (the main drillstring, above the insulator), and the bottom part (the drill bit, and other tools located below the insulator of the MWD tool). On surface, a wire is attached to the wellhead, which makes contact with the drillpipe at the surface. A second wire is attached to a rod driven into the ground some distance away. The wellhead and the ground rod form the two electrodes of a dipole antenna. The voltage difference between the two electrodes is the receive signal that is decoded by a computer. The EM tool generates voltage differences between the drillstring sections in the pattern of very low frequency (2‚Äì12 Hz) waves. The data is imposed on the waves through digital modulation. This system generally offers data rates of up to 10 bits per second. In addition, many of these tools are also capable of receiving data from the surface in the same way, while mud-pulse-based tools rely on changes in the drilling parameters, such as rotation speed of the drillstring or the mud flow rate, to send information from the surface to downhole tools. Compared to the broadly used mud-pulse telemetry, electromagnetic pulse telemetry is more effective in specialized situations onshore, such as underbalanced drilling or when using air as drilling fluid. It is capable of transmitting data faster at shallow drilling depths, onshore. However, it generally falls short when drilling exceptionally deep wells, and the signal can lose strength rapidly in certain types of formations, becoming undetectable at only a few thousand feet of depth. =Wired drill pipe= Several oilfield service companies are currently developing wired drill pipe systems, though wired systems have been trialled for many decades, and the Russians had a system in use in the 1960s. These systems use electrical wires built into every component of the drillstring, which carry electrical signals directly to the surface. These systems promise data transmission rates orders of magnitude greater than anything possible with mud-pulse or electromagnetic telemetry, both from the downhole tool to the surface and from the surface to the downhole tool. The IntelliServ wired pipe network, offering data rates upwards of 1 megabit per second, became commercial in 2006. Representatives from BP America, StatoilHydro, Baker Hughes INTEQ, and Schlumberger presented three success stories using this system, both onshore and offshore, at the March 2008 SPE/IADC Drilling Conference in Orlando, Florida. Cost for the drillstring, and the complexity of deployment, make this a niche technology compared to mud pulse. Retrievable tools MWD tools may be semi-permanently mounted in a drill collar (only removable at servicing facilities), or they may be self-contained and wireline retrievable. Retrievable tools, sometimes known as Slim Tools, can be retrieved and replaced using wireline through the drill string. This generally allows the tool to be replaced much faster in case of failure, and it allows the tool to be recovered if the drillstring becomes stuck. Retrievable tools must be much smaller, usually about 2 inches or less in diameter, though their length may be or more. The small size is necessary for the tool to fit through the drillstring; however, it also limits the tool's capabilities. For example, slim tools are not capable of sending data at the same rates as collar-mounted tools, and they are also more limited in their ability to communicate with, and supply electrical power to, other LWD tools. Collar-mounted tools, also known as fat tools, cannot generally be removed from their drill collar at the wellsite. If the tool fails, the entire drillstring must be pulled out of the hole to replace it. However, without the need to fit through the drillstring, the tool can be larger and more capable. The ability to retrieve the tool via wireline is often useful. For example, if the drillstring becomes stuck in the hole, then retrieving the tool via wireline will save a substantial amount of money compared to leaving it in the hole with the stuck portion of the drillstring. However, there are some limitations on the process. =Limitations= Retrieving a tool using wireline is not necessarily faster than pulling the tool out of the hole. For example, if the tool fails at while drilling with a triple rig (able to trip 3 joints of pipe, or about feet, at a time), then it would generally be faster to pull the tool out of the hole than it would be to rig up wireline and retrieve the tool, especially if the wireline unit must be transported to the rig. Wireline retrievals also introduce additional risk. If the tool becomes detached from the wireline, then it will fall back down the drillstring. This will generally cause severe damage to the tool and the drillstring components in which it seats, and will require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components; this results in a greater total cost than pulling out of the hole in the first place. The wireline gear might also fail to latch onto the tool, or, in the case of a severe failure, might bring only a portion of the tool to the surface. This would require the drillstring to be pulled out of the hole to replace the failed components, thus making the wireline operation a waste of time. Some tool designers have taken the retrievable 'slim tool' design and applied it to a non-retrievable tool. In this instance, the MWD maintains all of the limitations of a slim tool design (low speed, ability to jam on dust particles, low shock & vibration tolerance) with none of the benefits. Curiously, these tools still have a wireline spearpoint despite being lifted and handled with a plate.

It is part of the South East Sydney Local Health District and is an accredited principal teaching Hospital of the University of New South Wales. Overview As a major tertiary and teaching hospital, St George accepts patients from other parts of Sydney, NSW and beyond. It primarily serves about 250,000 residents of southern Sydney, in the St George area bounded by Botany Bay, Cooks River in the north, Georges River in the south and Salt Pan Creek in the west. Approximately 35% of the St George area's residents are from a non- English speaking background. The Hospital is also the nearest provider of specialist medical services for around 200,000 residents of the Sutherland Shire. The hospital has a designated medical trauma service and is the Medical Retrieval Service Coordination Centre for NSW. The Hospital's departments include anaesthesia, critical care, surgery, cancer care, medicine, women's and children's health, mental health, community health and medical imaging. In the 2002-2003 financial year there were more than 45,000 admissions (including day-only), and more than 723,000 outpatient treatments were administered. The Hospital has approximately 600 beds and more than 2500 staff (full-time equivalents) and is one of the largest in Sydney.About St George NSW Health Department History St George Hospital began operation in November 1894, as a cottage hospital. It became a district hospital in 1924 and began performing surgery. By 1934, it was equivalent to any other district hospital in metropolitan Sydney. In 1964, it became a teaching hospital with specialised departments and became known as The St George Hospital. In the late 1980s it underwent a A$200 million redevelopment into a tertiary teaching hospital, providing the people of southern Sydney with specialist healthcare services closer to home. In 1998, there was an unsuccessful attempt by the NSW government to transfer St Vincents Hospital from its site in Darlinghurst to the St George Hospital site. The plan was abandoned due to community opposition to the loss of the St George name, and uncertainties about the future of the obstetrics and gynaecology service under the St Vincents Catholic Church- run administration. In 2014 the hospital celebrated its 120th birthday.St George Hospital's 120th birthday stirs memories St George Leader 14 November 2014 St George Hospital School The Department of Education and Training operates a school within the hospital, known as St George Hospital School.

In this episode, the Hyperion Hotel is infested with silicone slug-like parasites that dry up their human hosts. When Fred becomes infected, Gunn turns to the angry and reclusive Wesley for help. Angel is stunned when his lost infant son reappears, now an adolescent boy calling himself the Destroyer. Plot As Angel tries to deal with the loss of his son while cleaning up the earthquake damage upstairs, a potential Angel Investigations client is infected by a transparent slug-like parasite in the hotel lobby. He goes to the juice bar across the street, where he chugs glass after glass of juice, saying, \\"We are thirsty.\\" When Lorne informs him of the disturbance at the juice bar, Angel brings the infected man back to the hotel, where he collapses into a pile of human dust. When a slug-creature exits from the dust, the gang realizes the man was actually a parasitic host. The hotel is locked up tight and Angel sends everyone out with weapons to hunt for the slug. As they search, they realize that the hotel is teeming with the parasites, which suck their human hosts dry. Angel suspects that the infestation is a result of \\"thaumogenesis\\", a price for the dark magics that Angel conjured to try to find his son. Meanwhile, at Wolfram & Hart, Lilah and Gavin once again quarrel with each other over their handling of Angel. Lilah and Gavin receive a top-secret e-mail about the consequences of Angel's dark magic at the hotel, which Lilah may also have to deal with since she was involved in the spell. She plans to rid the hotel of the slugs, until Gavin relays the message that Linwood wants Angel and the others to die for the torment he was put through. After learning the creatures glow in the dark, Angel shuts off all of the lights in the hotel and tracks the slugs by sound to a large ballroom. Researching by the light of a lantern, Fred is attacked by one of the slugs, which slithers into her mouth. Realizing Fred has been infected, Gunn brings her to the rest of the gang in the abandoned ballroom, saying they need to get her to a hospital; Angel stands in the way, determined to keep more innocents from dying. Groosalugg, hearing the slugs under the floor, breaks through the wood with an ax. Below, there is a hidden swimming pool, filled with the glowing slugs. They begin chasing after the gang. Everyone retreats to a kitchen and barricade themselves there, except for Gunn, who slips out to ask Wesley for help. Wesley is very bitter about his exile from the group and refuses until Gunn reveals that Fred has been infected. He tosses Gunn a bottle of alcohol and tells him he'll help this time, but he never wants to see any of his former friends again. Angel takes the water away from Fred until the slug confesses that a vicious killer called The Destroyer has chased the slugs into this dimension in search of Angel. They try to press Fred for more information, but her condition worsens. Gunn shows up and directs Groo and Lorne to hold Fred down while they force her to drink alcohol. As it dehydrates her, she coughs up the slug and Groo stabs it with a sword. Meanwhile, the slugs close in on Cordelia and Angel in the kitchen. Cordelia suddenly begins to glow a bright white, illuminating the entire hotel. This kills all the slugs and leaves everyone stunned by her new power. Lorne reminds the gang of the coming of \\"the Destroyer\\" and, almost immediately, lights flash and a big nasty demon appears, followed shortly by a young man who quickly slays the demon. He smiles and points a weapon at Angel, saying, \\"Hi Dad.\\" Production details According to the DVD commentary, the kitchen scenes in this episode were shot in the Ambassador Hotel in the kitchen area that Robert F.

Angel is happy in his newfound relationship with his son, but Connor is secretly waiting for revenge, mistakenly believing Angel killed Holtz - just as Holtz had planned as his final revenge on Angel. They train together at the hotel before going to a drive-in movie, where the pair fight off an armed hit group, sent by Linwood and Gavi] at Wolfram & Hart to abduct Connor. Meanwhile, Lilah continues to try to recruit Wesley by manipulation and seduction, and shows him that he is now very much like her: a human without a soul. The Groosalugg awaits Cordelia as she arrives to her apartment. He tells her he is leaving town because he knows that Angel is her priority. He tells her he will never be the man she loves, and she needs to go be with Angel. As they are having this conversation, Lorne and Angel are having a mirror conversation, where Lorne tells Angel Cordelia feels the same way about him as he does her.

She experiences a vision of herself, saying \\"I'm in love!\\" to which present day Cordelia questions \\"With Angel?\\" to which vision Cordelia replies \\"With Angel!\\" After the vision ends, Cordelia calls Angel to arrange a meeting at the beach \\"to talk about us\\".

Pero on drums for a while) and Fallen Angel featuring Ed Collins. Logan relates in Hell on Earth Part I how he met Joey DeMaio by almost running him over with his motorcycle, which is how the two hit it off. Logan is a fan of dirt biking. In 2006, he suffered an arm injury which delayed Manowar's \\"Demons, Dragons and Warriors\\" tour and the release of the band's new album \\"Gods of War\\". According to sources the injury was so severe that \\"it could have resulted in permanent nerve damage, ending his musical career\\", however Logan recovered and subsequently played with the band. More recently Logan has released a line of custom designed guitars which are sold through Manowar's website. In 2009, Logan accepted a limited number of students for one-to-one guitar lessons over Skype.http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID;=125495 Legal issues On August 9, 2018, Logan was arrested in Charlotte, North Carolina for allegedly possessing child pornography and was charged with six counts of third-degree exploitation of a minor.

Evidence revealed that Logan was in possession of several videos depicting young girls between ages 4 and 12 years old engaging in a variety of sexual acts with unidentified men. According to arrest warrants, the offenses took place between June 18 and August 2, 2018. His attorney Brad Smith said that he was \\"extremely cooperative with the investigation from the beginning, and he'll continue to do that.\\" Smith wouldn't comment on the details of the charges; however, he did say that there could be an explanation on the acts that Logan was accused of committing. Logan made his first court appearance on May 28, 2019 and was then booked into the Mecklenburg County Sheriff's Office thereafter, in which the federal magistrate judge ordered him to be held until his next hearing, which would possibly take place the next day.

In this episode, Wesley, now a hardened demon-hunter/killer with his own gang, leads the search to Denza who tells them that the Axis talisman will aid him in their search for Cordelia. Meanwhile, Gwen Raiden, a young mercenary with uncontrollable electrical abilities, is also looking for the talisman at the request of her employer, a wealthy businessman with connections to Wolfram & Hart. Plot In Wisconsin, 1985, a young girl named Gwen is dropped off at Thorpe Academy by her parents. Tightly wrapped up in thick clothes Gwen is discouraged from touching and finds it difficult to fit in with the other children. When a young boy approaches her at recess and offers her a toy car, she makes the mistake of touching him and shocking the boy with a fatal bolt of electricity. At Cordelia's apartment, Fred packs up Cordy's things because they can't afford to keep paying the rent. As Wesley and his gang fights off two large demons, Angel arrives and tries to thank Wesley for rescuing him, and to recant his promise never to forgive him for stealing Connor. Wesley however isn't interested in Angel's apologies. Wesley thinks Cordy is still alive, but in another dimension. Gwen, now a young woman, waltzes into a restaurant dressed in red leather, drawing the attention of all the men. She meets a businessman named Elliot, who wants Gwen to steal the Axis for his personal collection. Fred gives a presentation that explains the Axis of Pythia allows the user to see any person in the countless dimensions; her drawings are overshadowed by Angel's artistic abilities. They learn the Axis is located at an auction house with extensive security and gather the equipment they'll need while elsewhere, Gwen gets ready to steal the Axis herself. Lilah and Wesley share some small talk about work while they romp around his apartment together. Gwen expertly makes her way into the building where the Axis is held but only a short distance behind her, Angel, Gunn and Fred break into the building as well. Angel checks out the vault, but laser beams block his entrance and then a gate is dropped, completely blocking his path. Gwen drops down from the ceiling and manipulates the beams out of her way. While Angel questions who she is and her intentions, she steals the Axis and prepares to leave. Gunn shows up to help Angel while Fred triggers an alarm that encourages Gwen's fast retreat. Once the gate has been lifted out of the way, Gunn tries to grab Gwen before she gets away and instead is struck with a fatal blow by Gwen. Guilt-ridden at the thought of killing yet another innocent person, Gwen knocks Angel and a grieving Fred out of the way and shock-starts Gunn's heart. Later, Angel runs into Lilah while looking over Connor, who's now living outdoors with a bunch of homeless people. Angel threatens her into telling him which Wolfram & Hart client is buying the Axis of Pythia from Gwen. Gunn rests up in bed while Fred releases her feelings about the overwhelming elements of her life - Gunn's brief death and her constant responsibilities in the gang - as she yells at Gunn and finally breaks down into tears. Angel finds Gwen on the way to deliver the Axis and the two fight. Gwen repeatedly tries to shock Angel to death, which causes his heart to beat for a moment and the two kiss. Both are surprised by the sudden life to Angel's heart and then bars cover the elevator doorway and Elliot shows up. He explains that because of her terrible theft job, she has to be killed. He had the elevator changed so that Gwen could have no access to an electrical charge that would allow her to escape when the elevator is filled with gas. Once the door closes, Gwen struggles not to inhale while Angel punches a hole through a thick plastic wall until Gwen can reach the wires and the two are able to escape. Angel fights with Elliot's lackeys while Gwen focuses her attention on Elliot. Angel stops her from killing him and then she lets him have the Axis. Back at the hotel, one of the rooms glows a bright gold while Gunn and Fred wait impatiently outside the closed door. Angel exits the room, leaving a still slightly glowing Axis behind him. The three sit around the lobby and talk about what Angel saw and try to deal with her new role.

Production details Actress Alexa Davalos says she had \\"5 minutes of training\\" from stunt coordinator Mike Massa right before filming the fight scene with Angel. Tammy Kinsey comments on the cinematic experimentation in this episode, beginning with the close-up of Cordelia's eye that is reminiscent of the 1977 film Powers of Ten.

In \\"The House Always Wins\\", Angel Investigations takes a road trip to Las Vegas to enlist Lorne's help in returning higher being Cordelia to their dimension. While in Vegas, they learn the owner of the Tropicana Casino has been coercing Lorne into reading people's destinies, which the owner sells on the black market in a literal \\"futures\\" trading scheme. Angel falls under the influence of the house games, while back in Los Angeles Wesley tries to take advantage of Angel's absence to steal his clients. Plot As Angel watches Connor stake a vampire, Cordelia shouts he should focus on rescuing her from her boring life as a higher power. When Fred and Gunn confront Angel on the issues of Connor, Angel realizes he has made life difficult for his friends, and he takes them on a trip to Las Vegas. They arrive at the Tropicana Casino, where Lorne headlines, complete with scantily clad back-up singers known as the Lornettes. Lorne entices audience members to sing along and ignores Angel and the others. As Lorne rests in his private suite, he receives a visit from his employer and casino owner, Lee DeMarco. Lorne is forced to identify the futures of the people who sang in the audience. Gunn and Fred play Blackjack while Angel worries about Lorne. One of the Lornettes offers one of the singing audience members from Lorne's show, Vivian, a special chip to play in a Spin to Win game. Fred continues to worry about Angel and Lorne; they investigate Lorne's situation to help ease Fred's mind. To get past the guards at Lorne's door, Gunn has Fred dress as one of the Lornettes. Lorne takes a minute to recognize her but he is grateful to see her. He informs her Lee DeMarco is blackmailing him for his psychic abilities. Vivian walks in a trance-like state across the casino's driveway and is nearly run over by a taxi, but Angel rescues her. He sneaks into the special Spin to Win game area. Lee hands him a chip, which Angel tosses away, but it slides onto the table; when the house wins, Angel loses his destiny. Fred runs from Lorne's room and hysterically convinces the guards outside to enter the room. Lorne escapes, and the three run out into the casino to find Angel. He is playing slot machines in a zombie-like state and ask him to pose a distraction while they rescue Lorne. Angel is too entranced with his gambling to comprehend the plan. DeMarco is pleased when he receives information that Angel is a souled vampire, realizing Angel's destiny will be profitable. Lorne confesses he tells Lee about the people with bright futures so that they can be lured into the Spin and Win game. Their destinies are sucked into the chip they play and later sold on the black market. Guards spot them; to pose a distraction, Lorne sings a high-pitch noise into a microphone. After they escape, Gunn angrily assumes that Lorne told Lee about Angel. Lorne corrects him by revealing that he is being blackmailed, and if he refuses to cooperate, people will be killed. When Gunn realizes that Angel's destiny has been taken away, he returns to the casino and finds Angel at one of the slot machines. As Spencer arrives with Lorne and Fred held in the custody of his security guards, Angel resumes gambling. The rest of the group is brought into the back room, where Lee orders Fred and Gunn killed and Lorne to return to his work. Meanwhile, Cordelia manipulates Angel's slot machine to win a jackpot so he can be brought into the back room with the others. Lee is angered someone won, but Angel has no explanation. When one of the men pulls a gun on Fred, it brings out the demon in Angel. He beats up Lee's men, and during the distraction Lorne smashes the glass ball holding the chips, causing all of the destinies to return to their rightful bodies. Back in L.A., the gang is glad to be home, although Angel questions what caused his jackpot. As they head inside the hotel, they freeze when they see Cordelia standing in the middle of the lobby; she does not recognize them. Production details This episode was filmed on location in Las Vegas. \\"We shot from six at night to six in the morning for five nights,\\" recalls writer/producer David Fury. \\"It was like a movie shoot, we were real stars.\\" The Tropicana Casino at which Lorne headlines is an actual casino on the Strip, although creative license was taken with its location and history. For example, as the group flees the guards, they exit the casino onto Fremont Street (nicknamed Glitter Gulch), which is miles from the actual location of the Tropicana. In addition, Elvis and Priscilla Presley had their wedding reception at the Aladdin Casino, not the Tropicana as Angel claimed. While filming this episode, members of the crew took the opportunity to gamble; camera assistant Adam Ward won $10,000 in a Super Bowl bet. There are several inside jokes hidden in this episode. During the first shot into the audience during the scene where Lorne is on stage singing, David Fury and Angel script supervisor Petra Jorgensen are sitting in the first row. \\"I'm holding a little miniature Kelly Manners,\\" Fury says. One of the scrolling banners in the soul-trading room reads DEAL WITH DISNEY TO RUN NEW ABC SERIES, referring to co-creator David Greenwalt, who left Angel earlier that year to produce Miracles. =Writing= Writer/producer David Fury explains on the DVD commentary that early on, this episode emotionally establishes the characters, reminding viewers that Connor - although not integral to the story - is indeed \\"Angel Jr.\\" The scene in which Wesley has phone sex with Lilah was written by creator Joss Whedon when the episode came in short. Actor Alexis Denisof, who plays Wesley, explains that throughout this season his character is \\"flirting with and investigating the dark side of himself. He's looking at his relationships with all the people and with Angel, and he's definitely looking at his whole purpose and trying to figure out how he wants to be. There are going to be some things that really surprise the audience, that they'd never expect of Wesley.\\" In an essay linking themes in Angel to classic literature, Joshua Sherman points out that the motif of the stolen soul is dealt with elsewhere in mythology, such as the Soul Cage in Cornwall folklore, or Pakistani stories in which caged birds represent souls. =Acting= *Andy Hallett, who played Lorne, said this episode was his \\"favorite-favorite-favorite!\\" because the cast and crew got to go on location to Las Vegas. He said, \\"I've always wanted to have like a Vegas show, so it's like a real Vegas show...except that all the people sitting in the audience were getting paid to be there.\\" *Amy Acker had to dress as a Lornette for the scene in which she helps Lorne escape; Hallett says Acker kept joking, \\"Andy, I have to overact and act bad - can you give me any tips?\\" = Arc significance = *Cordelia finally returns from the higher plane without her memory. Her return plays a major role in the rise of Jasmine. *Lorne returns with Angel and co. to Los Angeles, after leaving at the end of Season 3. =Cultural references= * Name-dropping: Angel comments on his former friendships with Bugsy Siegel and the Rat Pack, and the fact that two members of the Blue Man Group are demons. He also attended Elvis and Priscilla Presley's wedding. =Music= *Actor Andy Hallett, who portrays Lorne, sings three songs in the episode‚Äî\\"It's Not Easy Being Green\\", \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Viva Las Vegas\\". Reception and reviews This episode was criticized for being a \\"throwaway\\" episode, serving mostly as a plot device to get Lorne and Cordelia back into the series, and for its \\"thinly veiled\\" and heavy-handed allegory using magic to show how people can lose their dreams and ambitions by throwing money away in the casinos.

The Scenic Area itself is at about . Its total land area is and approximately of the area is classified as virgin red spruce forest. Trees in this section range up to in diameter at chest height and are upwards of 300 years old. The remaining have only been subjected to selective timber harvesting, mostly for the task of removing broken limbs.

History The area surrounding the GSA was thoroughly clear-cut between about 1900 and 1920 by lumbermen of the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company, based at Cass. Maurice Brooks described the circumstances whereby a portion of the virgin forest was spared in his classic book on Appalachian natural history: > Some years before the Civil War a speculating land company bought a tract of > on the slope of Shavers Mountain.

The tract was eventually purchased by the Forest Service at the insistence of former MNF Supervisor Arthur A. Wood, who believed that future generations should know what an Appalachian spruce stand was like. In October 1964 the Regional Forester designated this area as a Scenic Area and the Forest Service began to manage it as such. In December 1974 the GSA was designated a National Natural Landmark for its exceptional value. In May 1983 it was registered by the Society of American Foresters as an outstanding example of a vegetative community in a near natural condition dedicated for scientific and educational purposes.

Written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain and directed by Bill L. Norton, it was originally broadcast on November 3, 2002 on the WB network. Plot Fred's article on superstring theory is published in an academic journal, and she is asked to present it at a physics symposium by her old college professor Seidel. Her presentation is interrupted when a dimensional portal opens and snake-like creatures emerge to kill her. Angel had spied Lilah during the speech and at first thinks she is behind it, but she was simply keeping an eye on Wesley. Gunn and Angel suspect another member of the audience, a comic book fanatic who seemed to be expecting the portal's appearance, but it turns out he's just following stories of strange disappearances and reading about Angel on internet forums. Fred learns that Professor Seidel is the one responsible and that he was the one who sent Fred into the Pylea dimension six years earlier. He felt Fred and other missing colleagues were competing for his job. Against Angel and Gunn's advice, Fred pursues vengeance against her former mentor. She asks for Wesley's help. When she is almost sucked into a portal opened by a text message from Seidel, Wesley agrees to help. Meanwhile, Cordelia is staying with Connor at his vast empty loft. He trains her to slay vampires while romance blossoms. Angel confronts Seidel (largely to protect him from Fred's vengeance), but Seidel releases a demon from a portal to attack Angel. Seidel tries to escape, but he encounters Fred. She opens her own portal, intending to send him to a hell dimension as punishment. As he is being sucked in, Gunn arrives. When he is unable to convince Fred to close the portal, Gunn snaps Seidel's neck and throws him into the portal. Fred and Gunn lie to Angel that Seidel fell victim to his own portal meant for Fred. Connor arrives at the Hyperion Hotel to pick up Cordelia's things because they have decided to live together. Connor and Cordelia battle a common vampire. Elated when she stakes it, Cordelia impulsively kisses Connor. Connor embraces her, but Cordelia is uncomfortable and pulls away. She explains that she still doesn't know who she is or where she belongs. Connor angrily realizes that she's going back to Angel. Cordelia arrives at the hotel to talk to Angel. She tells him that she is the same person she was before her amnesia, and that person doesn't need protecting. After Angel promises not to lie to her anymore, she asks him if they were in love. Production details =Arc significance= * This episode begins the breakup of Fred and Gunn's relationship, and indicates Connor's growing affection for Cordelia as the two share a kiss. * In addition, Wesley and Lilah's complicated relationship is further developed, as she brings him a gift and realizes that he is still attracted to Fred. * Angel demonstrates that he has photographic memory when he re-creates the auditorium environment with chairs and is able to recall exactly where every lecture attendee was seated and how each one responded to the portal. * Despite the story originally suggesting it was simply a coincidence that Fred came upon the book, it's revealed that Fred's college professor Seidel was responsible for her being sent to Pylea, as well as several other students. A later episode, \\"Inside Out,\\" implies Seidel himself was manipulated by the demon Skip as part of a long-term plan to assemble the members of Angel Investigations. =Cultural references= * The Incredible Hulk: After Angel threatens Lilah she responds with \\"Yeah, yeah, 'Hulk smash'\\" a common phrase from the Hulk comic books. * Daredevil, Elektra, and Bullseye: During the scene with comic book reader, Jared, Gunn references Bullseye killing Elektra in Daredevil #181. * Dark Horse Comics: During the same scene, Jared is wearing a Thwack! shirt, the comic book fan says, \\"we're kinda crushing the Dark Horses\\" when Gunn is pushing him up against the comic book rack, on which Dark Horse comics such as Usagi Yojimbo are visible.

Freed in 1807 after the death of his mistress, Pierre took the surname of \\"Toussaint\\" in honor of the hero of the Haitian Revolution which established that nation. In 1996, he was declared \\"Venerable\\" by Pope John Paul II. After his marriage in 1811 to Juliette Noel, Toussaint and his wife opened their home as an orphanage, employment bureau, and a refuge for travelers. He also contributed funds and helped raise money to build Saint Patrick's Cathedral on Mulberry Street. He was considered \\"one of the leading black New Yorkers of his day.\\" His ghostwritten memoir was published in 1854. Toussaint is the first layperson to be buried in the crypt below the main altar of Saint Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, normally reserved for bishops of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Life =Early life= Born on June 27, 1766, in modern-day Haiti, Pierre Toussaint was born a slave.Recent sources give his birth year as 1781; see discussion in Jones, Arthur. Pierre Toussaint: A Biography (Doubleday, 2003; Capparoe Books, 2020). Pierre was the son of Ursule at the Artibonite plantation, and owned by the B√©rard family. The plantation was located on the Artibonite River near Saint- Marc on the colony's west coast. His father's name is not known. He was known to have a sister Rosalie. His maternal grandmother, Zenobe Julien, was also a slave and was later freed by the B√©rards for her service to the family. His maternal great-grandmother, Tonette, had been born in Africa, where she was sold into slavery and brought to Saint-Domingue. He was raised as a Catholic.Couve de Murville, M.N.L., Slave from Ha√Øti: A Saint for New York?, London: Catholic Truth Society Pierre was educated as a child by the B√©rard family's tutors and was trained as a house slave. The senior B√©rards returned to France, taking Zenobe Julien with them, and their son Jean B√©rard took over the plantation. As the tensions rose which would lead to Haitian slaves and free people of color rising in rebellion, in 1787 B√©rard and his second wife left the island for New York City, taking five of their slaves with them, including Pierre and Rosalie.Recent sources state the B√©rards and their slaves arrived in New York City in 1797 - see Jones, Arthur. Pierre Toussaint: A Biography (Doubleday, 2003; Capparoe Books, 2020). =New York= Upon their arrival in New York, B√©rard had Pierre apprenticed to one of New York's leading hairdressers. The master returned to Saint-Domingue to see to his property. After Jean B√©rard died in St. Domingue of pleurisy, Pierre, who was becoming increasingly successful as a hairdresser in New York, voluntarily took on the support of Madame B√©rard. His master had allowed him to keep much of his earnings from being hired out. (Pierre's kindness to his mistress was noted by one of her friends, Mrs. Philip Schuyler, whose notes were a source for the 1854 memoir of Toussaint.) Madame B√©rard eventually remarried, to a Monsieur Nicolas, also from Saint-Domingue. On her deathbed, she made her husband promise to free Pierre from slavery. As a very popular hairdresser among the upper echelon of New York society, Toussaint earned a good living. He saved his money and paid for his sister Rosalie's freedom. They both still lived in what was then the Nicolas house. He was freed at age 45. Catherine (\\"Kitty\\") Church Cruger, two years older than Toussaint, would become one of his key clients and friends. She was the daughter of John Barker Church (who would give the pistols to Hamilton for the duel in Weehawken) and Angelica Schuyler, the muse and confidante of Hamilton and Jefferson. Due to connections among the French emigrant community in New York, Toussaint met people who knew the B√©rards in Paris. He began a correspondence with them that lasted for some decades, particularly with Aurora B√©rard, who had been his godmother. The B√©rards had lost their fortune in the French Revolution, during which Aurora's father died in prison and her mother soon after. Her other siblings had married in France. Toussaint also corresponded with friends in Haiti; his collected correspondence filled 15 bound volumes, as part of documentation submitted by the Archdiocese of New York to the Holy See to support canonization. =Marriage and family= In 1811 Toussaint married Juliette Noel, a slave 20 years younger than he, after purchasing her freedom. For four years they continued to board at the Nicolas house. They adopted Euphemia, the daughter of his late sister Rosalie who had died of tuberculosis, raising the girl as their own. They provided for her education and music classes. In 1815, Nicolas and his wife moved to the American South. Together the Toussaints began a career of charity among the poor of New York City, often taking baked goods to the children of the Orphan Asylum and donating money to its operations. =Charity= Toussaint attended daily Mass for 66 years at St. Peter's in New York.Deborah Sontag, \\"Canonizing a Slave: Saint or Uncle Tom?\\", New York Times, 23 February 1992, accessed 18 February 2012 He owned a house on Franklin Street, where the Toussaints sheltered orphans, and fostered numerous boys in succession. Toussaint supported them in getting an education and learning a trade; he sometimes helped them get their first jobs through his connections in the city. They also organized a credit bureau, an employment agency, and a refuge for priests and destitute travelers. Many Haitian refugees went to New York, and because Toussaint spoke both French and English, he frequently helped the new immigrants. He often arranged sales of goods so they could raise money to live on. He was \\"renowned for crossing barricades to nurse quarantined cholera patients\\" during an epidemic in New York. Toussaint also helped raise money to build a new Roman Catholic church in New York, which became Old St. Patrick's Cathedral on Mulberry Street. He was a benefactor of the first New York City Catholic school for Black children at St. Vincent de Paul on Canal Street. As Toussaint aged, he continued his charity. At his death, his papers included records of his many charitable gifts to Catholic and other institutions; his character was lauded by friends and acquaintances. He was \\"one of the leading black New Yorkers of his day\\", but his story became lost to history. =Later years= Euphemia died before her adoptive parents, of tuberculosis, like her mother. Juliette died in 1851. Two years later, Pierre Toussaint died on June 30, 1853, at the age of 87. He was buried alongside his wife and Euphemia, in the cemetery of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral on Mott Street. Juliette Noel Juliette Noel Toussaint was the wife of Pierre Toussaint and both consecrated their lives to helping the poor and doing charitable work. Juliette was born into slavery in 1786; she was held by a French family. Her freedom was purchased by Pierre before they married in 1811. They continued together the charitable works Pierre had begun. The couple helped refugees find jobs, cared for orphans, and opened a school to teach black children. They also provided financial help to the Oblate Sisters of Providence. When a plague struck the city of New York, they worked and cared for the victims. She died in 1851 in New York. Pierre was eighty-five years old at the time Juliette died. Some people support opening the beatification of Juliette, who they say served equally with Pierre. Veneration After the formal approval by the Holy See of the cause for Toussaint's canonization, his grave was located and identified in the cemetery where he had been buried. His remains were transferred to the crypt of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue, which serves as the seat of the Archbishop of New York. Legacy *1854, a biography, Memoir of Pierre Toussaint, Born a Slave in St. Domingo, was written by Hannah Farnham Sawyer Lee and published in Boston, one of the genre known as slave narratives.Hannah Farnham Sawyer Lee, Memoir of Pierre Toussaint, Born a Slave in St. Domingo, Boston: Crosby, Nichols, and Company, 1854; Documents of the American South, University of North Carolina *The Pierre Toussaint Haitian-Catholic Center in Miami, Florida, is named for him. *Toussaint Academy San Diego (formerly The Pierre Toussaint Academy of Arts and Sciences) is a residential secondary school for homeless 14-18 year old youth founded by Father Joe Carroll in 1992 and operated as a component of Father Joe's Villages (formerly Saint Vincent de Paul Villages). Over 1100 youth have benefitted from a healthy, stable environment in which to develop identity, self-worth, a sense of belonging, and connection to community honoring the legacy of Pierre Toussaint. *Toussaint is remembered for his good works by a series of portraits in Gracie Mansion. Canonization process *In the 1950s, the John Boyle O'Reilly Committee for Interracial Justice, an Irish-American group devoted to social justice for blacks, began researching and publicizing Toussaint's life story. *Because of Toussaint's reputation of great charity, Cardinal Terence Cooke, then Archbishop of New York, authorized the formation of a canonization committee to study further. Based on their findings, in 1991 his successor, Cardinal John O'Connor, strongly supported Toussaint for sainthood and began the official process, according him the title of Servant of God. O'Connor sent the needed documentation to the Vatican for this process. As part of it, the cardinal had Toussaint's body exhumed and examined. He was reinterred in the main cathedral. *Toussaint was the first layman to be honored by burial in the crypt below the main altar of St Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The crypt is normally reserved for bishops of the Archdiocese of New York. *In 1996 Toussaint was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II, the second step toward sainthood.

Written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon, it was originally broadcast on November 10, 2002 on the WB television network. In \\"Spin the Bottle\\", Lorne performs a magic spell on Cordelia to help her regain her memory, but instead the spell causes all the Angel Investigations members to revert to their teenage personae. Plot After his rendition of \\"The Way We Were\\", Lorne addresses an unseen lounge audience. In an attempt to restore Cordelia's memory, Lorne obtains a bottle containing a memory-restoration spell, which Cordelia is eager to try. Wesley arrives, having been asked to help with the spell, and has an awkward meeting with Fred. She vaguely informs him that her mission was completed, as Gunn realizes that Wesley helped Fred try to kill her professor. When he confronts Wesley, he also threatens Wes to not pursue Fred, but Wes tries to dismiss the issue. Gunn asks what happened to Wesley. He reminds Gunn that \\"I had my throat cut and all my friends abandoned me.\\" The gang hold hands in a circle around the bottle as it starts to spin. The spell disorients everyone; Lorne passes out and the others stumble about the lobby as if very high. Cordelia accidentally smashes the bottle with her boot. All present are mentally regressed to the age of 17: Cordelia when she was the most popular girl at Sunnydale High, Wesley believes he is still a student at the Watcher's Academy, Gunn is once again a rebellious street kid, Fred is transformed into a younger and insecure girl who likes marijuana; and Angel has reverted to his teenaged pre-vampire self ‚Äî an Irishman named Liam (he was not sired until age 26). While Liam wonders what happened to his Irish accent, Gunn and Wesley butt heads on plans. When Wesley tries to demonstrate his toughness with a karate demonstration, he unintentionally activates the stake weapon up his sleeve. Gunn and Fred find Lorne passed out behind the counter, and are shocked to see a demon. Meanwhile, Connor saves a young woman from two vampires. The woman offers her body in repayment, but only if he pays. Back at the hotel, Wesley duct tapes Lorne to the seat in the lobby while arguing with Gunn over whether to cut Lorne's head off or torture him for information. When Cordelia asks why they're not freaking out about wooden stakes or the sight of a green man with horns, Wesley and Gunn both reveal that vampires and demons are real and they both have experience with them. Fred examines an unconscious Lorne while Wesley shares his theory that they're being kept in the hotel with a vampire as a test. They all start to wonder why they don't look 17, and collectively decide to hunt for the vampire that will supposedly set them free once they kill it. Cordelia and Angel team up and go one way while the other three head in the other direction. Angel struggles to adjust to this strange world that is hundreds of years beyond his life. He and Cordelia sit on the bed, and after apologizing for acting so \\"womanish\\", Cordelia comforts him, and, feeling his muscles, begins to flirt with him. Angel vamps out and realizes he is a vampire and he will be killed if the gang finds out. Angel tries to leave the hotel, but panics when he spots the cars on the street and rushes back inside. As the group regathers in the lobby, Wesley introduces a new theory: the vampire may be one of them. He passes a cross around the group, but when it finally reaches Angel, he manages to hide his smoking hand until a distraction develops. Lorne wakes up, his memory unaffected, and identifies Angel as a vampire. Angel punches Lorne, knocking him out again. A fight breaks out between Angel, Wesley and Gunn, and the girls run in separate directions. Angel catches Cordelia, who screams loudly, drawing a lurking Connor out of the shadows. Angel rants to Connor about fathers as the two fight, while in the lobby, Lorne convinces Fred to release him, and he mixes together a concoction to restore their memories. After treating the others, Lorne puts a touch of the mixture on Cordy's tongue. She pauses and then runs off. Lorne finishes up his story at the lounge: describing what really happened was she was struck with a vision of a terrifying demon; Cordelia reveals to Angel that she remembers everything, and confirms that before she lost her memory she was in love with him. Lorne then walks off and the camera reveals an empty Lounge. Production details Writer/director Joss Whedon says this episode grew out of his desire to see Wesley returned to the \\"bumbling moron\\" of the past. \\"We were reminiscing about the days when he was a complete idiot, and so we thought we wanted to see old-school Wesley but also cool, new-school Wesley,\\" Whedon explains. Although the regression to a comedic figure contrasts his new, darker persona, Wesley still exhibits heroism during this episode, which is in line with the growth his character experienced over the last four years. Peggy Davis argues that \\"Wesley can embody masculine heroism or feminine comic figure, but not both\\"; however in this episode he demonstrates that his heroic masculinity allows for a comedic element as well. In addition to bringing back \\"classic Wesley\\", this episode also gave the opportunity to refresh viewers' memories of \\"teenage bitch queen\\" Cordelia from Buffy, whose character changed dramatically during her time on Angel. Whedon gave Lorne's spell the side-effect of making the gang \\"high\\" to differentiate this memory spell from a similar one used in the Buffy episode \\"Tabula Rasa\\", readily admitting the spell itself is \\"lazy writing,\\" meant only to set the plot in motion. The frame narrative established by Lorne in the night club was done to highlight the postmodern aspects of the episode, explains Whedon. The artificiality of the night club, and Lorne's breaking of the fourth wall when he comments on the commercials that played during the act break, provides a foreground for the alternate reality caused by the spell. Whedon notes that while writing this episode, he already knew that Connor and Cordelia were going to have sex, but the story had to move faster than he had originally planned because Carpenter became pregnant. =Acting= This episode took much longer to film due to the cast finding it difficult to stop laughing. Amy Acker and Andy Hallett ruined dozens of takes by giggling, and Alexis Denisof and David Boreanaz prolonged shooting for an hour and a half when they couldn't stop laughing. To get the scene, Denisof explains he and Boreanaz resolved not to look at each other; on the DVD commentary Whedon points out background shots where Boreanaz is still failing to keep a straight face. =Continuity= *This episode follows a similar plot to the Buffy episode \\"Tabula Rasa\\" where all the characters forget who they are because of a spell gone wrong. It also mirrors the Buffy episode \\"Band Candy\\" where all the adults are turned into teenager versions of themselves. *The age the characters regress to is unclear; Fred states \\"not one of y'all look 17\\", implying that would be the age they think they are, but Cordelia has no recollection of slayers or vampires nor does she recognize Angel. Cordelia initially believes herself to be the victim of a \\"sophomore hazing\\" prank, indicating she's regressed to sophomore year. She didn't meet Angel until towards the end of her sophomore year, and wasn't aware of the supernatural world until the very end of her sophomore year. Cordelia's reaction to Angel's entrance, \\"Hello salty goodness\\" is exactly the same as when she met him for the first time. *When Wesley says, \\"there are stories at the Watcher's Academy of a test. A secret gauntlet which only the most cunning can survive. You're locked in a house with a vicious, deadly vampire, and you have to kill him before he kills you. It's been done in the past with Slayers,\\" he is speaking of the Cruciamentum that Buffy had to undertake in \\"Helpless\\". *Fred speaks to a plant in this episode, as she previously did in \\"That Old Gang of Mine\\". Also, Spike mentions speaking to plants is one of Illyria's powers in \\"Origin\\". *Fred confuses a Slayer with the thrash band of the same name. This is the second time in Buffyverse that Slayer has been mentioned in association with Buffy's title. The first was by Forrest in the Buffy episode \\"Doomed\\". *Fred asks if anyone else took a personality test recently, with questions \\"about politics and your bowel movements and if you want to be a florist...\\" This would seem to be the same florist question test that was mentioned in \\"Doppelgangland\\". *Cordelia says Connor is 18 years old, the first time he is given a concrete age after returning from Quor'Toth in the third season. *Angel, in his 18th-century original identity of Liam, sees vehicles and runs into the hotel, believing them to be demons, as did Buffy when she believed herself to be an 18th-century maiden in the Buffy Episode \\"Halloween\\". *It is uncertain when the narration of the episode by Lorne takes place. It is assumed it takes place after the episode ends, but some comments imply he was aware of the ultimate consequences of the spell (Jasmine's emergence), placing it at the end of the season. *The Beast makes his first appearance in Cordelia's vision, but he does not fully appear until the next episode. *After losing her memory, Cordelia is extremely upset at the thought of missing her senior prom, which was depicted in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Three episode \\"The Prom\\". Though none of them were aware of it at the time that she made the comment, both Angel and Wesley were in attendance. The latter, who was then harbouring feelings for Cordelia, asked her to dance. * The song \\"The Way We Were\\" that Lorne sang in the opening, was also sung in the Season 2 \\"Disharmony\\" episode at Caritas by Harmony. Reception and reviews The DVD commentary for this episode, featuring writer/director Joss Whedon and actor Alexis Denisof, ranks 86th on the list of top 100 commentary tracks for DVD boxsets and movies on RateThatCommentary.com, and 3rd on Slayage.com. This episode is one of the more well regarded of the season, with UGO Networks commenting that it is \\"a bit of a high point\\" of the season and \\"great fun all around.\\" Pointing out that Whedon had previously explored amnesia on Buffy, here he \\"goes back to the well here with a twist.\\" Sci-fi.com calls it the best of the \\"light\\" episodes this season, due to the writing and directing credits of Joss Whedon. The Futon Critic named it the 33rd best episode of 2002, saying \\"it was particularly interesting in this episode to see Cordelia (along with the rest of the cast) forced to revisit their younger selves after a memory spell goes awry. How Chase, David Boreanaz, Alexis Denisof and company all step their characters back a few years without missing a beat is something that borders on extraordinary to watch.\\" References External links Angel (season 4) episodes 2002 American television episodes Television episodes written by Joss Whedon Fiction about memory erasure and alteration Television programs directed by Joss Whedon ","title":"Spin the Bottle (Angel)"},{"id":"3528299","text":"\\"Apocalypse, Nowish\\" is episode 7 of season 4 in the television show Angel. Written by Steven S. DeKnight and directed by Vern Gillum, it was originally broadcast on November 17, 2002 on the WB network. The WB referred to this episode as \\"Rain of Fire\\" when it was first aired, which DeKnight attributes to \\"legal issues\\" over the title's reference to the 1979 film Apocalypse Now. In \\"Apocalypse, Nowish\\", Angel Investigations deals with a sudden wave of paranormal activity all over Los Angeles, portending the rise of the apocalyptic beast of whom Cordelia has been experiencing visions. As the Beast rises from the bowels of the Earth to bring a rain of fire over the city, Cordelia and Connor make love. Plot Cordelia tells Angel that she still loves him, but that during her time as a higher power she saw and felt all the carnage he formerly wrought as Angelus. She now needs him to give her time to sort out her feelings. When Lorne wants to learn what Cordelia remembers about her time as a higher power, Angel insists that they wait. Connor comforts Cordelia after another nightmare featuring the demon from her visions. Meanwhile, as Angel Investigations is flooded with calls involving paranormal activity all over Los Angeles, Wesley returns home after fighting a bug infestation to find Lilah dressed as Fred for sexual role-playing. Suddenly, Cordelia starts breathing hard and her eyes turn white as she warns Angel that \\"he's coming.\\" Cordelia lies down and tells Angel and Connor what she remembers of her vision. Back at the hotel, Lorne picks up on the strained relationship between Fred and Gunn; since they jointly sought revenge on the man who sent Fred to a hell dimension, Fred has not been able to forgive Gunn for their actions. She leaves for the diner where she and Gunn are regulars. Angel goes to Wolfram & Hart to demand that Lilah return the information the law firm sucked out of Lorne's head about the impending apocalypse. Cordelia and Connor walk to an alleyway that Cordelia recognizes as the place where Connor was born, where Darla staked herself. A large, horned demon bursts from the ground before them, knocking them both down. Connor attacks, but he takes a brutal beating before the demon strides away. Cordelia tends to Connor's wounds and finds that he has broken ribs. At the diner, a waitress tries to advise Fred on her relationship troubles, until an earthquake shatters the diner's windows. Meanwhile, unable to locate Fred, Gunn is restless and tries to leave to find her, but Wesley appears and interrupts his departure. Aware of all the strange occurrences around town, he offers to work with them to deal with this problem, but Gunn's too angry with Wesley to even consider the idea. Angel stops them all from leaving because he has information from Lilah that they must study to prevent the end of the world. The trio examine the pages containing information stolen earlier from Lorne's brain. Another call is taken by Lorne and Angel instructs him to start mapping the locations from where the calls originate. The pages make no sense until Gunn sees that the pages fit together like a puzzle. Rearranging the sheets reveals a symbol shaped like a square with an \\"X\\" inside representing the \\"Eye of Fire.\\" Lorne makes another discovery: the mapped locations of strange occurrences form the same pattern. Angel and the gang determine that the location on the map that appears at the middle of the X is a popular club on a high rooftop. They arrive at the club to find a mass of dead bodies and the Beast waiting for them. Angel and the team take on the demon but are overpowered. Crossbows, axes, and swords don't have much impact, so Wesley tries a series of guns that also fail. Angel renews the battle and manages to send the demon to its knees, until the demon stakes him in the neck. The demon sends Angel flying off the roof to the city street. The demon forms the Eye of Fire using the dead bodies and sets them ablaze. Angel rips the stake from his neck and slowly begins to recover. The fire on the roof rises towards the sky and soon fire starts to rain down as Connor and Cordelia watch. Connor blames himself for the whole situation, but Cordelia comforts and reassures him that he's not to blame. Cordelia kisses Connor and offers him the chance to feel something real. While everyone else watches the fire, fearing the future that awaits them, Connor and Cordelia have sex. Connor is seeking comfort in her arms. Angel is shown to be observing through the window on top of a nearby building. Production Executive producer Jeffrey Jackson Bell employed the effects shop Almost Human to design Vladimir Kulich's costuming and make-up. Almost Human makeup designer Chris Burdett says it took 2‚Äì3 days for four people to sculpt the costume and another 7 hours to fill and shape the huge fiberglass mold; a life cast was made of Kulich so that the suit would fit him exactly. The night before shooting was to begin, the crew finally established the costume's paint scheme. Kulich went through an eight-hour make-up process to transform him into the character of the Beast, including prosthetics and fiberglass body suit, but \\"The worst part was the contact lenses...[that] cover the entire eyeball,\\" the actor said. However, the isolating nature of the 50 lb costume meant that \\"I was able to search a little deeper for material while I was in the character because I was cocooned off...It was liberating.\\" Writer Steven S. DeKnight says all the full-suit shots of the Beast feature stunt double Scott Workman. They cut to Kulich only for the close-ups. According to director Vern Gillum, \\"J. August Richards is terrified by rats, just like his character. This is the nicest guy in the world and it was just torment for him beyond anything you could imagine.\\" In the final fight scene, which took two full days to film, Charisma Carpenter had to be careful doing her stunts, as she was pregnant. =Arc significance= *After appearing for a split second in Cordelia's vision in the previous episode, the Beast fully appears in this episode and becomes one of Angel Investigations' most powerful foes. *Upon rising, the Beast reacts to Cordelia, foreshadowing her future role in the season. *Wesley officially rejoins the team, having been just the occasional helper since he kidnapped Connor in Season 3. *The Jasmine-possessed Cordelia's tryst with Connor will have severe ramifications, leading to her pregnancy, the eventual birth of Jasmine in embodied form, and ultimately, Cordelia's death. *Connor calls Angel \\"dad\\" for the second time, showing his growing affection for Angel (the first was his initial appearance from Quor- Toth, when he said \\"hi, dad\\") *Cordelia rejects Angel because of his actions as Angelus, but that was deception as she was had already put in motion her plans to be impregnated by Connor. =Continuity= *Gunn's fear of rats was first mentioned in \\"Heartthrob\\". *Fred previously went to the diner in \\"Couplet\\" and \\"Loyalty\\", both times with Gunn. *Gunn's home-made axe (made from a vehicle hubcap) is crushed by the Beast in the ensuing fight. The axe was first seen in the season 2 episode \\"Dear Boy\\" and made numerous appearances over the next two seasons. *Cordelia dreams about The Beast attacking her, even though she is actually possessed by Jasmine. * Two of the three prophecies given to Wesley by the Loa in the previous season are fulfilled at the end of the episode. The earth shakes and the air rains fire. The sky turning to blood is fulfilled a few episodes later when the Beast blots out the sun. =Cultural references= *Apocalypse Now: The name of this episode is a play on the name of the 1979 film, which the Scooby Gang watch in the Buffy episode \\"Restless.\\" *Jaws: Lorne's line, \\"I'm gonna need a bigger arrow\\" may be an allusion to Brody's line \\"You're gonna need a bigger boat\\" in the 1975 film. *The final fight scene with the Beast references many classic cinematic fighting styles, including The Matrix (the Beast deflecting arrows while the camera does a slow motion circular pan), the films of John Woo (Wesley firing two handguns while moving laterally), and Terminator 2: Judgment Day (Wesley pushing the Beast backwards with repeated shotgun blasts). Reception Writer Steven DeKnight says, \\"One of the biggest things this year has been the reaction to \\"Apocalypse, Nowish.\\" Everybody loved the show, basically giving it five stars then taking three away because of the very end.\\" When fans speculated why Cordelia would sleep with Angel's son, DeKnight cautions, \\"There is a bigger reason for it that will become apparent as well... You have to remember it's a long story arc.\\" Many people were disturbed that Cordelia slept with Connor, and Charisma Carpenter agrees: \\"I hear a lot of \\"ewwww,\\" and I agree. It is ewwwy. Only something deplorable and devilish and truly evil could do something so horrid.\\" References External links Angel (season 4) episodes 2002 American television episodes ","title":"Apocalypse, Nowish"},{"id":"3528307","text":"Parametric Stereo (PS) is lossy audio compression algorithm and a feature and an Audio Object Type (AOT) defined and used in MPEG-4 Part 3 (MPEG-4 Audio) to further enhance efficiency in low bandwidth stereo media. Advanced Audio Coding Low Complexity (AAC LC) combined with Spectral Band Replication (SBR) and Parametric Stereo (PS) was defined as HE-AAC v2. An HE-AAC v1 decoder will only give mono sound when decoding an HE-AAC v2 bitstream. Parametric Stereo performs sparse coding in the spatial domain, somewhat similar to what SBR does in the frequency domain. AAC HE v2 An AAC HE v2 bitstream is obtained by downmixing the stereo audio to mono at the encoder along with 2‚Äì3 kbit/s of side info (the Parametric Stereo information) in order to describe the spatial intensity stereo generation and ambience regeneration at the decoder. By having the Parametric Stereo side info along with the mono audio stream, the decoder (player) can regenerate a faithful spatial approximation of the original stereo panorama at very low bitrates. One channel Because only one audio channel is transmitted, along with the parametric side info, a 24 kbit/s coded audio signal with Parametric Stereo will be substantially improved in quality relative to discrete stereo audio signals encoded with conventional means. The additional bitrate spent on the single mono channel (combined with some PS side info) will substantially improve the perceived quality of the audio compared to a standard stereo stream at similar bitrate. Constraints However, this technique is only useful at the lowest bitrates (approx. 16‚Äì48 kbit/s) to give a good stereo impression, so while it can improve perceived quality at very low bitrates, it generally does not achieve transparency, since simulating the stereo dynamics of the audio with the technique is limited and generally deteriorates perceived quality regardless of the bitrate.

It was published by Suvini Zerboni and the first performance was given by Berio in Milan in 1953. The variations are based on a three-note melodic cell‚Äî\\"fratello\\"[014]‚Äîfrom the opera Il prigioniero by Luigi Dallapiccola, to whom the work is dedicated . Major changes between the two versions are indicated below, but many other small changes may be found, mostly additions to render the harmony more complex. * First variation: calmo e flessibile. No theme is stated in this piece. Like Webern's piano Variations a twelve-tone row stated at the beginning stands in for a theme. The first variation remains largely within the ppp‚Äìpppp range. It begins with a series of major ninths (the number nine plays a significant role in the structure of the piece) and gradually gains in rhythmic and harmonic complexity. * Second variation: (quarter note) poco meno del (eighth note) precedente. Mostly built on a sharp dotted motif but rapidly gains in speed and density, building up to a fff climax. * Third variation: prestissimo (e ben articulato). Fragments of motifs thrown around with rests and accents. A short cadenza (dotted quarter=104) intervenes (the designation \\"cadenza\\" is taken out in the revised version). Finally, a coda prestissimo, rapidly building up from very soft to extremely loud, closes this variation (the word \\"coda\\" is removed in the revised version). * Fourth variation: legatissimo e volante. Beginning pppp, with rapid, highly chromatic scale passages (sometimes divided between the hands) and fragments of motifs tossed around. Builds to several climaxes. The bottom score of page 13 and the first two scores of page 14 are new to the revised version. * Fifth variation: calmo. Return to the pensive mood of the first variation, but with an intensely lyrical melody set among a large number of ornaments. The original version of the piece lacks almost all of these ornaments and is rhythmically far more simple and static (all the nontuplets are only found in the revised version). * Coda: Return to the stationary, ninth-dominated motives of the start, mostly in the ppp range with much pedal.

Angel is preoccupied with the indestructible Beast storms through Wolfram & Hart, leaving a trail of destruction and reanimated zombies in his wake. Plot synopsis Fred waits impatiently at the hotel, and Wesley, Gunn and Lorne return, battered and bruised from their battle. Fred and Gunn embrace. Cordelia tries to tell Connor that the night before was a one-time deal, but he storms out, feeling the pain of her rejection and blaming himself for the Beast's intrusion. Wesley is visited by Lilah who's relieved to find him alive. Wesley's not as welcoming to her affections though, and he breaks off their relationship, choosing to fight for the good side. Connor sneaks into Lilah's office, but Lilah attempts to have him captured and tested for their purposes. Connor takes the situation into his own hands and orders Lilah to help him learn everything they do about the Beast. The lights flicker and turn off as Connor realizes the Beast has arrived, rampaging through the lobby and tearing lawyers apart. Connor sets out to take on the creature himself. The Beast finds Gavin in a closet, snaps his neck and tosses him effortlessly against a wall. The Beast then goes after Lilah who tries first to shoot the creature and then negotiate, but he stabs her with one of his clawed fingers. After a couple of failed attempts at hurting the creature, Connor is recognized by the Beast and tossed aside into a stone pillar. Wesley arrives to rescue Lilah, using a hand grenade to temporarily stun the fast-approaching demon. Lilah leads the way to a storage closet where one of the only two emergency exits can be found hidden behind some shelves. They escape through a small passage and into the sewers below the building. Wesley instructs her to start over a build a new life somewhere else before the Beast finds her. As he leaves, she informs him that Connor is trapped in the building. Wesley returns to the hotel, and immediately Angel is determined to rescue his son. Meanwhile, Connor returns to his search for the Beast. As he passes over Gavin's body, the former lawyer's eyes fly open. Cordelia stays at the hotel with Lorne, and Wesley leads the rest of the gang back through the sewers to the secret exit of Wolfram and Hart. The group walks through piles of dead lawyer bodies and then split up to speed up the search. Angel finds Connor, but before they can escape, Gavin attacks Angel. Angel quickly points out that Gavin's a zombie as he knocks the former lawyer aside. Connor and Angel make a break for it as the various dead bodies around the halls all start to awaken. Fred, Wesley and Gunn are soon attacked by zombies as well and barricade themselves in an office. The zombies prove too overwhelming and everyone needs to escape, but all of the routes are obstructed by the zombies. Angel suggests they try the Conduit of the White Room he was in once before, so they try to use the elevator. Gunn spots Gavin at the front and takes a moment to chop off the zombie's head, while Angel finally gets the secret access code to work, and they're transported to the special white room. Once there, they spot the little girl lying on the ground as the Beast kneels above her, extracting a black cloud of energy, or possibly her life, from her. She tells them, \\"The answer is among you\\" and then before the Beast can get his hands on them, the young girl mutters some words and transports the gang back into the hotel. Cordelia hugs Connor while Lorne questions the others about what happened. Soon afterward, Cordelia tells Angel that she was worried and he orders her to take her new boyfriend, i.e. Connor, and get out. Writing It is never established exactly why the Wolfram & Hart employees are re-animated as zombies. It is suggested that the Beast (or, by extension, anyone associated with it) was responsible, or alternatively that it is a mystical failsafe which is automatically activated at Wolfram & Hart during emergencies. However, in \\"Home\\" it is revealed that Lilah Morgan remains in the employ of Wolfram & Hart, even after her death. Lilah describes this as a \\"standard immortality clause\\", suggesting that all employees have such a contract. =Arc significance= *Wesley breaks up with Lilah after several episodes of an ongoing complicated relationship. Lilah hides her pain with callousness, and expresses her belief that he is joining Angel Investigations again because of Fred. *The Beast's massacre leaves the Wolfram & Hart building in shambles, and its employees dead, with Lilah being the only known exception. It remains this way until the season finale, when it appears to have been mystically restored and remodeled. *This episode also hints that the evil is among them- the group mistakenly believes soon after this that the little girl from Wolfram and Hart meant Angelus, but it appears she was actually referring to Cordelia/Jasmine's role in everything taking place. *Lorne mentioned to Angel about if he was a cool teacher. This referenced how he killed Jenny Calendar in \\"Passion\\" on Buffy. =Continuity= *Angel demonstrates his photographic memory, previously seen in \\"Supersymmetry\\". *The White Room was last seen in \\"Forgiving\\". *This episode marks the last appearance of Gavin and the second and last appearance of the Girl. =Cultural references= * Habeas Corpus: The episode's title refers to the legal action. * in Hebrew the episode was called \\"◊™◊ï◊ì◊î, ◊û◊ê◊í◊£ ◊î◊í◊ï◊ï◊ô◊î\\", \\"thanks; corpse department\\". sounded like \\"debts collecting department\\".

The electro-kinetic cat burglar-for-hire, Gwen Raiden, returns and reluctantly helps Angel and the group after they discover that the Beast is searching for five mystical Totems in order to block out sunlight from Los Angeles so that all demons and vampires can roam freely. Plot Lorne brings Angel some blood in his room. Gwen Raiden meets a client, Mr. Ashet. Just as the man suggests not killing her for canceling on him, the Beast shoves a fist through the man's chest, sending Gwen flying. Connor is restless in his warehouse. Cordelia gets a vision of the Beast and immediately rushes to talk to Angel. Gunn and Fred brainstorm the meaning of the little girl's words. Wesley reveals he has discovered the little girl was Wolfram & Hart's connection to the Senior Partners but she was also an entity named Mesektet. He explains that Mesektet was one of five totems in a group known as the Ra- Tet. Fred finds out it was Ma'at, another totem of the Ra-tet. she felt she was in the body of someone talking to the Beast. Gwen arrives at the hotel to mixed feelings about her presence, but her experience with the Beast proves to be useful to them. Fred discovers Gwen's client was another Ra-tet member, one composed of light. Needing to find and protect at least one of the two remaining totems, Angel suggests he and Gwen go find Semkhet in Death Valley. Angel and Gwen sneak into the cave holding Semkhet, but find they're too late and the body has already been destroyed. As Angel wonders about the reason for the Beast killing off the Ra-tet, a rather ordinary man appears and explains that the beast is trying to stop the light of the sun. The man reveals himself to be Manjet, or Manny, the only surviving member of the Ra-tet, and keeper of the orb. Manny explains that the Beast is planning a ritual using the Ra-tet to eventually black out the whole world from the sun and turn the earth into a land for demons. Angel brings Manny back to the hotel, but the gang quickly realizes the hotel is not the safest place for them to protect Manny. Angel mentions to Cordelia that Gwen's money came from the Axis of Pythia he used to track Cordelia and then gave to Gwen. The gang brainstorm about Manny being an orb keeper, and what could have been taken from him. Gwen reveals that the Beast took something out of the chest of the Shaman she was visiting, despite earlier having claimed to have seen nothing. The timing and stealthiness of the attack and the spiked drinks lead the gang to believe it was an inside job, but no definite suspect can be pinned down. They return to the hotel and find information about the ritual from Lorne's research. Wesley and Fred announce they've discovered what seems to be the only way to get rid of the Beast: opening a portal to send it through. Gunn reacts badly to this idea, but Fred reminds him it's their only option. Cordelia also senses she knew the person the Beast was talking to, leading them all to believe Connor is involved. The Beast finds Connor at his warehouse and promptly throws him out the window. Angel and the gang pull up just in time, charging upstairs to stop the ritual. Wesley and Fred work on opening the portal while the others attack the Beast, who has already started the ritual. While the portal opens behind the Beast upstairs, outside Cordelia gets to see more of her vision and the sun begins to darken. With several consecutive blows, Angel and the others manage to send the Beast through the portal and out of their world. Upstairs, the Beast reappears behind the gang and speaks, saying he met Angelus in the past, and again offering an alliance of their evil. The beast grabs the orb and swallows it whole, then flies out the window. Cordelia figures out her vision was actually a memory from when she was a higher power and saw all of Angelus's actions over time. Angel doesn't remember such a meeting in the past, and he states that it's not something he'd forget, but Wesley suspects the Beast has been able to control Angel in some way. Wesley announces that the only one who may have the knowledge they need to defeat the Beast is Angelus, so they need him back.

Comparative analysis of aligned protein sequences has led to the discovery of two conserved signature indels which are specific for the order Bifidobacteriales. The first indel, a 1 amino acid deletion in ribosomal protein L13, is found in all Bifidobacteriales species and no other Actinobacteria, providing a potential molecular marker for the entire Bifidobacteriales order. The second indel that has been identified is a 1 amino acid insertion in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase found in all Bifidobacterium species and G. vaginalis, but not in any other Actinobacteria. This indel is thus characteristic of the clade consisting of Bifidobacterium species and G. vaginalis and can be used to distinguish these genera from the rest of the order Bifidobacteriales. 16 conserved signature proteins have also been identified which are unique to the order Bifidobacteriales and can be used as molecular markers for this order.

As he loses his soul, it turns out that this all took place in Wo-Pang's illusion, designed to make Angel achieve perfect happiness, and thus Angelus is awoken. Production details =Arc significance= *Angel voluntarily gives up his soul and reverts to Angelus. He remains as such for the next several episodes. =Cultural References= *The group's adventure under the city bears many resemblances to scenes from the Indiana Jones saga, most obviously in Angel's utterance of \\"Wood. Why'd it have to be wood?\\" =Continuity= *This is the first true present-day appearance of Angelus since \\"Becoming\\", in season 2 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Angel had temporarily taken on the behavior of Angelus briefly during \\"Eternity\\", due to a drug-enhanced delusion of happiness, and had played the part of Angelus convincingly in \\"Enemies\\" in an orchestrated attempt to convince Faith that Angel had turned on Buffy. Other than Cordelia (and Wesley, if the incident from \\"Eternity\\" is considered), this is the first encounter any of the gang has had with Angelus' former self. *This episode marks the second time a mystic is called upon to remove Angel's restored soul, the first (unsuccessful) attempt being \\"Enemies\\" from season three of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. In both episodes the two mystics are dressed in similar robes.

Written by Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain and directed by actor Sean Astin, it was originally broadcast on February 5, 2003 on the WB network. In \\"Soulless\\", Angel‚Äôs soul has been locked away in an office safe so that his alter ego Angelus can be interrogated about the Beast. After taunting Wesley, Gunn, and Fred about their faults and revealing damaging secrets he, as Angel, knew, Cordelia strikes a deal with Angelus so that he will share information about the Beast. Plot At the Hyperion Hotel, the gang carefully put Angel's contained soul away in the safe, discussing the great risk they all face in dealing with Angelus. Meanwhile, an unchained Angelus sits alone in the basement cage. Wesley cautiously approaches the cage and starts up a discussion with Angelus. Angelus plays games with Wesley, avoiding the important information about The Beast in favor of taunting Wesley about his romantic interest in Fred while the rest of the gang watch the conversation from the lobby via video feed. Angelus continues to be difficult, raising issues of Wesley's failure with Faith and Connor. Connor returns to receive strange looks in the aftermath of Angelus's news, but misinterprets the looks as everyone still thinking he's connected to the Beast. Gunn and Fred bring Angelus a glass of blood and Angelus happily takes advantage of the opportunity to taunt the couple about the sounds Angel could hear coming from Fred's room at night. Fred pushes a cart towards the cage and Angelus takes the glass, but also shoves the cart into Fred and grabs her when she falls towards the cage. Gunn moves in to rescue Fred, but it's Wesley who shoots Angelus with tranquilizer darts, freeing Fred and knocking Angelus out cold. In Wesley's office, Fred thanks him for saving her, but the conversation takes a turn for the romantic as Wesley kisses Fred. Gunn walks in and, after realizing that something just happened between them, he gets furious. The two men begin to fight until Gunn accidentally hits Fred when she tries to stop them. Angelus is pleased with the discord he has created. Connor approaches Angelus, who tells Connor that his mother Darla and his adoptive father Holtz were eager to get away from Connor. Connor calmly replies that he knows that Angelus is his real father. Angelus thinks he can take advantage of this and encourages Connor to approach, but Cordelia interrupts and sends Connor away. She then turns off the video camera and offers herself in exchange for all of Angelus's information on the Beast. Angelus is reluctant to take her offer, but later Cordelia informs the gang that Angelus is willing to talk, although she refuses to tell them what she did to get Angelus to talk. Wesley goes downstairs and begins to ask questions. Angelus explains that in 1789, the Beast tried to bribe Angelus into helping him kill three priestesses who were attempting to banish the Beast. Angelus refused to help, and then the priestesses appeared and banished the Beast. Gunn finds that the women live nearby. Wesley, Cordelia, and Connor find the priestesses and their families have already been murdered by the Beast. After seeing a \\"Daddy's Birthday\\" reminder on the family's calendar, Connor runs outside to be sick. Cordelia chases after him and she tries to talk to him, but some vampires interrupt the moment, sending the gang into battle mode. Connor disposes of one and Wesley gets the car for them to escape in. They return to the hotel and everyone realizes that without useful information from Angelus, they need to turn him back into Angel. Cordelia goes downstairs and, despite Angelus's enthusiasm to have her, Cordelia tells him the deal is off since they didn't get to save the world and that they're putting his soul back. Angelus doesn't seem too worried about that, as he's confident he'll get to see the apocalypse come to life. Cordelia returns to the office only to find bad news: the container holding Angel's soul is gone. Production \\"Soulless\\" was directed by actor Sean Astin, who played Samwise Gamgee in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings. After Astin told writer/director and close friend Doug Petrie about his \\"fervent desire to be directing episodic television,\\" he shadowed producers David Greenwalt and Tim Minear for several weeks to get a feel for the series before he was given this episode to direct. \\"Television sort of mandates that you keep moving,\\" Astin says, \\"but you don't want to stop. Angelus [has] so many layers and so many different shades and qualities, you want to keep exploring them and mining them and pulling them out. It's such a rich, meaty character for him to do. He's good at evil. It's a little creepy.\\" Cultural references *Angelus refers to the Ancient Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex when he tells Connor, \\"I mean, when you think about it, the first woman you boned is the closest thing you've ever had to a mother. Doing your mom and trying to kill your dad. There should be a play.\\" *He also refers to Fred and Gunn as Othello and Desdemona, and the line \\"Bodies, bodies everywhere, and not a drop to drink,\\" is a reference to a similar line in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. *Angelus's reference to the \\"foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart\\" comes from the William Butler Yeats poem \\"The Circus Animals' Desertion\\", and that animalistic element is also present in his choice of music in his cage at the beginning, \\"The Teddy Bears' Picnic\\", a song which, later in the lyric, promises good things to the good, but also speaks of watching them (the bears) and \\"catch them unawares\\". *Angelus also wonders out loud why Angel is fond of Raiders of the Lost Ark, referring to his Indiana Jones-style adventure in the alternate reality in the previous episode.

The gang scrambles to locate Angel‚Äôs soul, while Angelus tells the group that the Beast is controlled by a higher being further up. Plot Connor, Wesley and Cordelia force their way into the Shaman's chambers and question him about Angel's soul, only to find that Angel's soul still remains in its container, although he warns them that if the container is broken and the soul isn't being controlled, the soul will cease to exist, Angelus will get out, and they'll \\"be screwed.\\" Angelus continues to taunt the gang, angering Gunn over his relationship with Fred. Lilah sneaks in, emerging from the sewers holding a crowbar and attempts a deal with Angelus, revealing that the Beast has murdered everyone affiliated with Wolfram & Hart except for her. Gunn finally spots Lilah on the video monitor and rushes downstairs to put a tranquilizer dart in Angelus, while Lilah runs off. While the others question Lilah's intentions, Wesley chases and catches her. He thumbs through her copy of Rhinehardt's Compendium, finding information his copy does not contain. Lilah had received her copy on the pan-dimensional black market, and Wesley determines someone had erased the information in this dimension. Angelus wakes up and informs the gang that the Beast actually works for someone or something. Wesley returns with Lilah, but the gang are extremely suspicious of her and drill her about her intentions. Gunn leaves to keep watch on Angelus, who pushes Gunn's buttons again over his relationship with Fred and the gang. He mentions Dr. Seidel's death (from \\"Supersymmetry\\"), which he knows about because \\"even Angel's not that stupid.\\" He offers to keep what Fred did a secret, but Gunn corrects him that Fred didn't kill Seidel, prompting Angelus to praise him for \\"steppin' up and bein' the man!\\" Angelus mock-commiserates with Gunn about Fred's affections shifting to Wesley, citing Wesley's recent descent into more violent behavior as the cause; \\"for once in your life,\\" Angelus teases, \\"you just weren't dark enough.\\" Gunn responds with a blast from his flame thrower, and Angelus crows that there's \\"hope\\" for Gunn yet. Fred informs Wesley that she's no longer with Gunn. Wesley takes the news as an opportunity to make another move on Fred, though he's interrupted by Cordelia and Lilah. Lilah and the gang argue about the possibility of saving the world, but then Cordelia gets a vision that allows her to see how to get Angel's soul back. Fred goes downstairs to inform Wesley about Cordy's vision, and she exchanges barbs with Angelus. While mock-praising Wesley, Angelus casually mentions his sexual liaisons with Lilah - another shock for Fred. Gunn and Connor dig up the grave of a soul eater, the skull of which is needed to return Angel's soul. Once they hit the coffin, the soul eater proves to be more active than dead and attacks the duo. With Connor incapacitated, Gunn is able to chop the demon to bits and retrieve the head. Meanwhile, the Beast offers a gift to its unseen master; a knife made of his bones. Cordelia and Fred present the talismans they built for the spell while Gunn and Connor return with the fresh demon head. The spell is set up in the basement while Angelus tries to discourage them from trying. Wesley chants and a white soul- like mist emerges from the skull, passes through the talismans and surrounds Angelus in the cage. Angel's soul seems to be returned and once Angel sings for Lorne, it's concluded that his soul really has returned. Still worried, Angel decides to stay in the cage and direct the others. Cordelia refuses to take his orders because he's acting like a coward and convinces him that he needs to be out of the cage. Free, Angel grabs Cordy, revealing that the spell did not work and that he is still Angelus. Cordy fights back and tries to hide in the cage, but Angelus knocks her out and heads upstairs to continue his Angel charade. Angelus drops in on Fred, and the others are still fooled by him, but they don't get long to chat as he leaves, spouting an excuse about going out to save the world. Spotting an unconscious Cordy in the cage, they realize Angelus lied and depart to find him. A consensus is reached that they won't be saving Angelus, they'll be killing him on sight now. Angelus roams the crazy streets of LA, but can't find anything but dead bodies and vampires, and he doubles back to the hotel. Lilah fires a round of bullets at him and Cordy tries to shoot him with the crossbow, but none of the attempts are successful. Angelus throws the crossbow bolt back at Cordelia's leg, taking her down and leaving him to deal with Lilah. Connor tracks Angelus back to the hotel. Angelus stalks Lilah until he finally finds her trying to hide. He takes her ax from her, but before he can kill her with it, she tosses him over a stair railing and runs off. Cordelia stabs Lilah in the neck (using the dagger the beast offered to its master earlier in the episode), informing a dying Lilah that she let Angelus out for a reason. Writing During the episode, Lilah references sending in the \\"cavalry\\" (a group of warriors), which is often confused with the episode's title, \\"Calvary.\\" The Calvary, or Golgotha, was the site near Jerusalem where Jesus was crucified. =Arc significance= * Lilah is murdered by Cordelia, who is under the possession of the being later known as Jasmine.

Ltd. () is a listed property developer in Hong Kong and a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. The company's principal activities are property development and investment, project management, construction, hotel operation, department store operation, finance, investment holding and infrastructure. It is the third largest Hong Kong real estate developer by market capitalisation. The company is controlled by Dr Lee Shau Kee, who speaks for approximately 70.17% of the share capital as at June 2015.  History  Founded by Li Shau-kee, the company was taken public in 1981 by Sun Hung Kai Securities. The shares were introduced at HK$4 by a novel, geared, method ‚Äì there was to be an initial downpayment of HK$1 per share upon subscribing to the offer, with cash calls of another HK$1 six months later. The final HK$2 instalment would be due at the year end. In 2006, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) found that Henderson had breached the foreign-exchange regulations in the amount of HK$565 million. Henderson allegedly engaged Shenzhen Zhaotian Investments, headed by Tian Chenggang ‚Äì whose father is former vice-premier Tian Jiyun ‚Äì to lobby for leniency from the potential fine of 150 million yuan, according to Tian. On 4 December 2006, the company was issued with a fine of 2.33 million yuan (HK$2.9 million), which the company paid. Zhaotian sued in Hong Kong in 2012, claiming an oral agreement between Tian Chenggang and CFO Alexander Au for a HK$43 million \\"consultation fee\\", and failed upon appeal in 2015 due to the absence of documentary evidence of the agreement.http://www.scmp.com/news/article/1736205/tian-jiyuns-son-loses- appeal-over-hk43m-payment-henderson Subsidiaries and associates The company's stakes in its principal associates as at 31 December 2014 were Towngas (41.51%), Miramar Hotel and Investment Co, Ltd (45.08%) and Hong Kong Ferry (33.33%). =Henderson Investment= As at 31 December 2014,Henderson Investment (\\"HI\\") was a 69.27% listed subsidiary of the Company (67.14% as at 30 June 2006), which previously held the group stakes in the Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Company, the Miramar Hotel Group, and The Hong Kong and China Gas Company. Its shares have been consistently trading at below NAV. Privatisation attempt In November 2002, the company attempted to buy out minority shareholders by making an all-cash offer of HKD 7.60, representing a 40% discount to NAV. The buyout offer fell when it was opposed by more than 14% of the holders of the outstanding shares. In November 2005, it made another attempt when it offered one share for every 2.6 share in HI, although the offer was subsequently sweetened to 2.5 shares. The revised deal valued HI at an 18% discount to its net asset value. The company had persuaded shareholder Templeton Investment to back the buyout. Nevertheless, this second offer was again rejected, more narrowly this time, by 10.94% of the minority vote. This was in excess of the statutory blocking vote of 10%. Asset sale to parent =Miramar and HK Ferry= When trading in both companies' shares were suspended on 26 March, there was speculation that the Company would launch another buyout attempt after the expiry of the one year legal moratorium. On 27 March 2007, it was reported that the Company would not make another privatisation bid for the time being, but offered HK$12.1 billion for some of its subsidiary's assets, principally the holdings in Miramar Hotel and Hong Kong Ferry held by Henderson Investment. HI would make a special distribution of HK$5 per HI after the sale. Net of the HKD10.35 billion special distribution for its 73.5% stake, Henderson's net cash outlay will be $1.75 billion. =Towngas= On 3 October 2007, the company proposed to pay market value only to gain control of Towngas. It would acquire the 39.06 percent stake in Towngas held by subsidiary Henderson Investment for HK$42.86 billion in cash and convertible notes. Minority shareholders of Henderson Investment, who together hold 30.73%, would receive 204.1 million Henderson Land shares and HK$1.19 billion in cash. The offer was considered by analysts to be favourable to the Company, and David Webb criticised the deal saying Henderson was acquiring the stake on the cheap, without paying any control premium to minority shareholders of Henderson Investment. Webb further criticised the nature of the offer as a back-door privatisation of Henderson Investment, which would virtually be a shell company after the transfer of the stake. On 7 November, Henderson sweetened the offer to appease minority shareholders (mainly Elliott Capital) by increasing the cash portion to HK$2.24 per share.Victor Cheung, \\"Henderson Land all set to take over Towngas\\" , The Standard, 9 November 2007 On 7 December 2007, Henderson secured shareholders' support for the usurpation.Victor Cheung, Henderson Land gets control of Towngas , The Standard, 8 December 2007 =Sunlight REIT= On 8 December 2006, the company spun off and listed 12 office and 8 retail properties in Hong Kong into a Real Estate Investment Trust, Sunlight. However, the issue fell by 6.5% on its market d√©but on 21 December, and as at March 2007 has fallen 16.2 percent (since the listing) due to investors' apprehension of financial engineering of the REIT. The estimated distribution yield stands at 10%, the highest among Hong Kong REITs. Yet, investors fear a decline of distribution after yield-boosting mechanisms, such as interest swaps. Henderson Land also offered a temporary dividend waiver as a sweetener. Yields are expected to fall in 2010, and again in 2012 as rental reversions come through. The issue's flop was cited as the reason Regal Hotels International chose to delay its own planned REIT offering. Development projects =Beverly Hill= Beverly Hill Beverly Hill () is an upper class private housing estate in Happy Valley, Hong Kong, jointly developed by Henderson Land Development and Hang Lung Properties in 1988. It has ten 37-storey residential blocks built at a very steep slope of Broadwood Road and Link Road.Beverly Hill = International Finance Centre = International Finance Centre 39 Conduit Road In a joint venture with Sun Hung Kai and MTR Corporation, the company developed the International Finance Centre complex, which includes the landmark waterfront property and then tallest building in Hong Kong, completed in 2003.

Soon after the development was launched in October 2009, the developer claimed to have sold a five bedroom duplex flat, on the \\"68th floor\\" of the 46-storey the building for HK$439 million (US$57m). The price, equating to US$9,200 per square foot, set the new world record for the most expensive apartment.

After discovering Lilah‚Äôs dead body, a grieving Wesley breaks rogue slayer Faith out of prison so she can help track down Angelus. Meanwhile, Lorne performs a sanctuary spell to keep Angelus out of the hotel while Cordelia‚Äîsecretly revealed to be the big evil controlling the Beast‚Äîconfides in Connor that she is pregnant. Plot Angelus, who has been stalking Lilah, is disappointed when he finds her already dead. Wesley and Gunn discover him holding her body, drinking whatever is left of her blood; he escapes through a window, allowing the two to assume he killed her. Downstairs, when Wesley and Gunn return to the lobby with news of Lilah's death, Lorne suggests protecting the hotel with the same magic that forbids violence at his club. When the group realizes that Angelus could have turned Lilah into a vampire, Wesley offers to prevent her potential rising. Angelus visits a demon bar‚Äîwhere he is raucously received‚Äîto question the patrons on the whereabouts of the Beast. In the basement, Wesley prepares to behead Lilah. After an imaginary conversation where he apologizes for their \\"not-a- relationship\\", he finally brings down the ax. Connor intends to destroy Angelus despite Cordelia's protests, but when he starts to leave, Cordelia faints mid-speech and Connor stops to care for her. Meanwhile, Slayer Faith works out in prison until another prisoner threatens her with a knife. Faith efficiently knocks the woman out. As the corrections officer hauls the other prisoner away, reassuring Faith they saw how she was attacked, Faith notices the ornate Bringer knife that was used. Angelus follows the scent of Lilah's blood to the weapon used to kill her, in the Beast's possession. The Beast says Angelus is a part of his master's plans, but Angelus refuses to take orders and leaves. Cordelia‚Äîrevealed as the Beast's master‚Äîis disappointed. The Beast apologizes for his failures and she forgives him, then the two kiss. Lorne performs the protection spell, and Wesley returns from the basement saying he intends to restore Angel's soul. Wesley visits Faith at the prison to ask for her help; although initially disinterested, upon learning that Angelus has \\"returned,\\" she crashes through the glass, knocks out the prison guards, and jumps out of the high window with Wesley. (The clear implication is that Faith could have escaped prison any time she liked and only remained there as part of her self-imposed redemption efforts.) Faith tells him that she won't kill Angelus because of Angel's crucial role in her life and Wesley admits that's precisely why he chose her for the job. When they arrive at the hotel, Faith asserts herself as commander. Connor is displeased with her decision to rescue Angelus, not kill him, but Faith makes it clear her plan is the only plan. Angelus, after overhearing a Slayer is in town, immediately calls Buffy Summers's house. When Dawn Summers confirms her sister is still in Sunnydale, he realizes Faith must be the Slayer on the loose. Connor leads Faith, Wesley and Gunn into a factory (where Angelus has, with typical sardonic intent, erected a \\"Welcome, Faith\\" banner) and despite Faith's orders, beheads the first vampire that crosses his path. Faith yells at the teen for disobeying her and then tells him to go home because he refuses to listen to her. The two fight, but Faith is clearly stronger and eventually holds a crossbow to Connor's throat in warning. Connor returns to the hotel with Gunn, as Wesley and Faith split up to search the factory. Faith finds Angelus with the Beast; she is badly beaten by the creature until Angelus stabs the Beast with a dagger made of the Beast's flesh, killing the demon and restoring the sun. Faith knocks out a large window, flooding the room with sunlight, forcing Angelus to keep his distance. At the hotel, the gang rejoices in the return of the sun and Connor goes upstairs to tell Cordelia. Connor sings Faith's praises until Cordy interrupts with news that she's pregnant with his child. Production details =Writing= Writer David Fury was pleased to write for Faith's character again: \\"I love her voice. And for whatever reason, her voice just comes to me,\\" he says. \\"She has an attitude that is fun to write, saying things that are provocative or dirty or slightly off-color... That's the stuff that's most comfortable for me to do.\\" However, he found writing the scene between Lilah and Wesley challenging because he'd never written for Lilah before, although it \\"turned out better than I imagined,\\" Fury says. =Arc significance= * Faith escapes from prison to help the Angel Investigations team find Angelus. * Angelus kills the Beast and the sun returns. * It is revealed that \\"Cordelia\\" is the master of the Beast, and she reveals to Connor that she is pregnant with his child. =Continuity= *Crossover with Buffy the Vampire Slayer: While in prison, Faith is attacked by an inmate hired by the Bringers, agents of the First Evil who try to eliminate the Slayer line in Season Seven of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The inmate, Debbie, is played by Spice Williams-Crosby, who previously played a human assassin working for the demonic Order of Taraka in \\"What's My Line, Part Two\\"; it could be inferred that the two demon-employed criminals are in fact the same person, but the episode offers no clarification on this point. *When Angelus calls Buffy's house, he talks to Dawn Summers. This phone call is not shown in any Buffy episode. Furthermore, the phone call represents the only interaction between Angel / Angelus and Dawn in either Buffy or Angel. *This episode also reconciles Wesley and Faith for the first time to finally work together as Watcher and Slayer. In Season Three of Buffy Wesley had been sent to Sunnydale to officially replace Rupert Giles as both Buffy and Faith's watcher, which never worked out as Faith never worked with him or Giles since she had her own agenda set up as a rogue Slayer, which later turned her into a rogue criminal for hire. Their other brief encounter since Sunnydale had seen Wesley abducted and brutally tortured by Faith when she was hired to kill Angel by Wolfram & Hart, and her departure in the next episode by voluntarily turning herself to the authorities in search of redemption.

At a demon bar, Angelus is spoken to by a deep disembodied voice, which turns out to originate from Cordelia, projecting from the hotel. Angelus then surprises Fred at the hotel, claiming he is immune to the sanctuary spell. He demands information on the Beast's master and steals her research materials. Fred tries to shoot him with a tranquilizer dart but accidentally hits Lorne instead. Connor attempts to stop Angelus, but is repelled by the demon protection spell. Angelus is contacted again by Cordelia telepathically, and this time she threatens to restore his soul if he refuses to help. Fred's mood worsens as she feels inadequate to fight Angelus. Fred and Gunn kiss, but part, unsure about their feelings. Meanwhile, Cordelia convinces Connor to keep her sudden pregnancy a secret from everyone else. Faith and Wesley try to track Angelus at the demon bar. There they encounter human junkies, who get high on the vampire bites.

Written by Mere Smith and directed by Terrence O'Hara, it was originally broadcast on March 19, 2003 on the WB network. \\"Orpheus\\" concludes the three-episode arc involving guest star Eliza Dushku reprising her role as the Slayer Faith, beginning immediately where the previous episode ended: Angelus starts to feed on Faith. However, she had deliberately poisoned her blood with a psychedelic drug, and the two pass out. In his coma, Angelus is forced to relive his alter ego Angel's good deeds with Faith at his side, as Cordelia attempts to stop Willow Rosenberg from re-ensouling Angel. Plot After drinking from Faith, Angelus pulls away in shock as she flashes back to earlier, when she injected herself with a drug stolen from a vampire junkie at the demon bar. Angelus and Faith both collapse, unconscious. Gunn drags Angelus's body to the Hyperion Hotel, where he and Connor shackle Angelus securely in the basement cage. Wesley brings a barely alive Faith to one of the hotel bedrooms. Knowing Faith injected herself with Orpheus, an enchanted psychedelic drug that poses a serious threat to her life, Lorne berates Wesley for allowing Faith to purposely get bit by Angelus. Connor updates Cordelia on Faith and Angelus' conditions. Suddenly, Cordelia brutally shoves Connor into a wall in response to his constant talk about Faith. He's shocked and she tries to cover her behavior by blaming it on the pregnancy and crazy hormones. Downstairs, Connor shouts at Fred and Wesley about the need for killing Angelus, when Willow Rosenberg appears at the door suggesting that she's a better alternative. Fred called Willow for help since she's the only one alive to have successfully restored Angel's soul. Willow wants to see Cordelia again and Connor reluctantly takes her upstairs. As Willow talks about the difficulties associated with ensouling Angelus, Cordelia secretly reaches for a large knife under her pillow and tries to get Willow close enough to strike. Willow realizes if they break the jar, they can avoid all the complications and free the soul. Willow rushes out of the room in time to unknowingly avoid the knife thrown at her, which hits the door instead. In their shared coma, Angelus and Faith witness the 1920s-version of Angel rescue a small puppy from an oncoming car. Angelus is infuriated at being subjected to the memory again, and Faith realizes with glee that they're experiencing Angel's good deeds of the past. Next, a hippie Angel walks into a diner and selects \\"Mandy\\" on the jukebox, as Angelus complains to Faith about watching Angel's self-induced misery. A man barges into the diner and asks for money, but shoots the cashier when he doesn't react quickly enough. The shooter runs away, and Angel struggles with his desire to feed on the cashier, which wins out. The bite marks on dream- Faith's neck begins to bleed and she realizes Angel could have saved the cashier. Angelus watches on as Angel suffers with the guilt of feeding, enjoying Faith's pain as well. Before Willow can begin her spell to locate the jar holding Angel's soul, the Beast Master's deep voice screams a warning to stop. Willow's magic overpowers the Master's, and Willow begins her spell as Cordelia works counter-magic from the bedroom. When Connor breaks Cordelia's concentration by trying to enter the bedroom, Willow is able to magically shatter the jar. Using the Orb of Thesulah, Willow and Fred begin the ritual that will give Angel back his soul. Dream-Faith finds herself in a dirty alley with Angelus again, watching past-Angel, having forsaken all human ties, feed on a rat (shortly prior to the events of the 1996 flashback in \\"Becoming, Part One\\", wherein the demon Whistler almost literally dragged Angel from the gutter‚Äîcommenting on his rat-feeding habits in the process‚Äîand set him on the path to his supposed destiny as Buffy's ally and a champion of the Powers That Be). In a twist, past-Angel turns and addresses the twosome. Angelus and Angel face-off and begin to exchange blows, as Angel convinces Faith that life is worth living and she has to wake up. Faith disappears. When Connor finally breaks into her barricaded bedroom, Cordy smashes a lamp over his head, then pretends not to have known it was him. Cordy deceives Connor into thinking Willow's magic is evil and threatens their unborn child. She tells him he has to kill Angelus to protect their family. Willow completes the restoration spell, pulling Angelus and Angel into one body, while Faith wakes up and rushes downstairs to the basement in time to stop Connor from staking Angel. She begins to beat up Connor until Angel wakes up and stops the fight. Later, Faith tells Angel that she is going back to Sunnydale with Willow to aid Buffy and her allies. After they leave, a very pregnant Cordelia comes downstairs and shocks the gang with the serious trouble they still have to deal with. Production The WB network cut short the final moments of the first airing of \\"Orpheus\\" for an emergency broadcast announcing that the United States had invaded Iraq. The episode was rerun the following Sunday. Director Terrence O'Hara says the fight scene at the end of the previous episode and the beginning of this episode is \\"probably my favorite just because of the content of the show and the difficulty.\\" The scene was shot in an abandoned bank in downtown Los Angeles and employed scaffolding to make the fight \\"more vertical\\" according to producer Jeffrey Bell. O'Hara explains that due to Alexis Denisof's bad back, the show-motion shot of Wesley carrying Faith was a difficult one. The fight scene between Angel and Angelus, which took two days to film, was something that Bell had \\"waited to do for four years.\\" It was made possible by a split screen and a camera lock-off, explains O'Hara. \\"We played back to match shot for shot. He was hitting space.\\" The scenes of Chicago in the 1920s were filmed on Universal Studios' back lot. O'Hara enjoyed the look of the classic cars, although many of the moving cars were actually being pushed by the grips \\"because they were very noisy,\\" O'Hara says. Additional scenes showing Angel and Faith reliving portions of the episode \\"Are You Now or Have You Ever Been\\" had to be cut due to length. Jeffrey Bell says, \\"we apologize for the big, stupid floaty head\\" that appeared during the magical battle between Willow and Cordelia. He explains, \\"We had really great hopes for it and it just became something you'd see on It's a Small World in Disneyland. Just not quite as scary as we had hoped.\\" During the final shot of Faith and Angel on the terrace, which Bell describes as \\"a hallmark of a Joss Whedon show - all the good-byes and the sentiments without anyone ever getting sentimental\\" - Eliza Dushku came to the set with laryngitis and could not speak. \\"This scene was supposed to be first up,\\" says O'Hara. \\"I begged (show runner) Kelly Manners to keep it to the end of the day and let her recover, and she did.\\" =Acting= Producer Tim Minear had the idea to bring back actress Alyson Hannigan as Willow Rosenberg to re-ensoul Angel. This episode is Hannigan's third crossover into Angel; she previously appeared on the phone to Cordelia in \\"Disharmony\\", and delivered the news of Buffy's death at the end of \\"There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb\\". Hannigan, involved in both American Pie and Buffy while this episode filmed, was excited to work with her fianc√©, Alexis Denisof, whom she met while the two were on Buffy. Denisof was also excited. \\"I feel like it's a play day. I have to keep reminding myself that I'm at work,\\" he said. \\"My girl is here... really all I want to do is run over and give her a hug.\\" Terrence points out in the donut shop scene with Angel and Faith that, \\"The gunman here is actually Eliza's brother Nate.\\" Charisma Carpenter is genuinely pregnant in this episode, and has been since Cordelia's return from the \\"higher plane\\". =Writing= The title refers to the Greek myth of Orpheus. A legendary musician, Orpheus followed his dead wife into the Underworld to beg for her return. Asked how prison has changed the angry, aggressive Faith, Eliza Dushku says, \\"How would prison change anyone? There was something about the fact that she's a Slayer, so she wouldn't really be there unless she wanted to be, because she's got superhuman strength. She could have busted out of that joint if she really wanted to. But she and Angel developed this relationship. He was leading her down the road to redemption, kind of facing the things she's done and recovering from that, and hopefully being a better her. She's been in there, doing the time, thinking. She's still a tough girl, but she really has to suppress her demons a little more. In these past few shows, that's what we're seeing‚Äîher teetering on the line between the old her and the new her.\\" \\"It's a big arc for us,\\" says David Boreanaz. He explains that Faith and Angel \\"really get along well together. They owe each other... That's why, when she hears Angelus is out, she automatically breaks out of prison. She doesn't even think it, she's out. Because of what he's done for her. And they share that common bond.\\" He adds, \\"It's going to be interesting to see how Angelus relates to Faith, because he's never met her before and this is going to be fun for him.\\" Willow and (evil) Cordelia's conversation about what they've been up to since they last communicated, is similar to a conversation Buffy Summers and Amy Madison have in the 6th season of Buffy. Willow: (sits on the bed beside Cordy) How've you been? Cordelia: Higher power. You? Willow: Ultimate evil. But I got better. Buffy: Hi. (awkwardly) How've you been? Amy: Rat. You? Buffy: Dead. Amy: Oh. = Arc significance = *Faith accompanies Willow back to Sunnydale in \\"Dirty Girls\\" to aid in the battle against The First Evil. *Willow restores Angel's soul for the second time, and magically battles Jasmine (in Cordelia's body). *Willow openly flirts with Fred. = Continuity = *In Angelus' flashback, Angel chooses \\"Mandy\\" by Barry Manilow, the same song he sings the first time he sings at Caritas in \\"Judgment,\\" another pivotal moment in his fall and rise to eventual hero status. \\"Mandy\\" was first released in 1974, meaning the flashback must occur at some point after that; later in the episode, Angelus remarks that Angel spent twenty years feeding on rats after this incident, placing it in 1976, since a flashback in the Buffy episode \\"Becoming\\" depicts Angel as being lifted from his rat-feeding days by Whistler in 1996 (see above). Angelus also mentions that Angel sometimes attended Manilow concerts, much to Angelus' disgust. **The lyrics to \\"Mandy\\" are unusually relevant to Angel's life; the singer/narrator first describes himself as \\"a shadow of a man... crying in the night,\\" reminiscent of Angel's post-ensoulment despair and isolation. The lyrics also describe how the man \\"walked away when love was\\" his to have, similar to Angel's departure from Sunnydale years before, at the end of \\"Graduation Day,\\" leaving Buffy despite their love for each other. *Crossover with Buffy: Willow received Fred's phone call in \\"Lies My Parents Told Me\\". Several references to past events in Buffy the Vampire Slayer are mentioned by Willow including being gay, dating Kennedy, and Willow's turn to the dark side at the end of Season 6. *Fred references Sunnydale's Hellmouth. *This episodes marks Willow's third and final appearance on Angel. It is also the last Angel episode in which Faith is seen. Reception The Faith trilogy (beginning with \\"Salvage\\" and ending with this episode) was generally well received. UGO Networks called this arc \\"truly the high point of the entire season,\\" although was disappointed in the frequent silences on the director's commentary. However, webzine PopMatters complained about the rapid resolution of seemingly unsolvable problems in the last quarter of this episode. \\"We're left thinking none of them is so terrible as they seemed,\\" the reviewer wrote. \\"'Apocalypse' can only be uttered so many times before it starts to lose its urgency.\\" References External links Angel (season 4) episodes 2003 American television episodes Buffyverse crossover episodes Television episodes about drugs Television episodes about telepathy ","title":"Orpheus (Angel)"},{"id":"3528378","text":"Colombia competed at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. 35 competitors, 32 men and 3 women, took part in 30 events in 7 sports.

When it launched in 2002 as the National College Sports Network (later College Sports Television also known as CSTV), it operated as a multi-platform media brand which also included its primary website, collegesports.com, and a network of websites operated for the athletic departments of 215 colleges and universities. After CSTV was acquired by CBS in 2006 (handed over from Viacom who purchased the network the previous year), the network was re-branded as the CBS College Sports Network in 2008. The network initially maintained its college sports focus, but in February 2011, the service was re-branded as CBS Sports Network to re-position it as a mainstream sports service. The network continues to have a particular focus on college sports, along with coverage of smaller leagues and events, simulcasts of sports radio shows from both the CBS Sports Radio network and Entercom's WFAN (formerly owned outright by CBS), and studio and analysis programming. As of May 2015, CBS Sports Network was available to approximately 61 million pay television households (66.1% of households with cable television) in the United States. History Logo used from 2011 to 2016 The network's roots began in 1999 when Chris Bevilacqua approached the co-founders of the Classic Sports Network, Brian Bedol and Stephen D. Greenberg (son of Hank Greenberg) ‚Äì at that time, running Fusient Media Ventures, a New York-based sports and media company ‚Äì with the idea for a subscription network featuring college sports 24 hours a day. Under the leadership of Bedol as CEO, the network was originally named the National College Sports Network in June 2002, was subsequently renamed College Sports Television (CSTV) and launched on February 23, 2003. From their headquarters and studio operations at Chelsea Piers in New York City, CSTV was the first independent pay-television channel to be distributed nationwide, having been carried on satellite provider DirecTV at launch. In November 2005, College Sports Television was purchased by Viacom for $325 million. CBS Corporation (Viacom's legal successor) took control of the network in January 2006. On January 3, 2008, it was announced that CSTV would be integrated into CBS Sports, with the sports division's executive vice president and executive producer, Tony Petitti, taking over day-to-day operational management of CSTV, which would be overseen by CBS News and Sports president Sean McManus. CSTV co-founder Brian Bedol would become a senior advisor to CBS Corporation president and CEO Leslie Moonves (Petitti has since left CBS to take on the same role for the MLB Network). In the fall of 2006, CSTV launched more than 100 broadband channels dedicated to college sports, which feature more than 10,000 live events. The subscription/pay-per-view service, called CBS College Sports XXL, and its portfolio of broadband channels in its All-Access suite, include coverage of Notre Dame, Southern California, Kansas, Ohio State and North Carolina. =CBS reorganization= On February 12, 2008, CBS Corporation announced that, as part of the ongoing integration of CSTV into CBS Sports, that the network would be renamed the CBS College Sports Network on March 16, coinciding with the start of CBS's coverage of the NCAA's basketball tournament. Studio shows moved from the original Chelsea Piers headquarters to the CBS Broadcast Center on West 57th Street in 2012. As part of the relaunch, the network added a new news program, College Sports Tonight. That program was canceled in 2010, however other studio shows (including Inside College Football and Inside College Basketball) still originate from the Chelsea Piers location. On February 15, 2011, CBS announced that the network would be relaunched as CBS Sports Network on April 4 (coinciding with the end of the 2011 NCAA basketball tournament), repositioning it as a mainstream sports network. High definition A high definition simulcast feed of the channel, broadcasting at 1080i, was launched in August 2008. Prior to the launch of the feed, the two NCAA basketball tournament games that aired in March 2008, which were presented in HD on CBS, were converted to a standard definition feed. CBS Sports Network uses the AFD #10 broadcast flag to present programming on its standard definition feed in letterboxed widescreen for viewers watching through 4:3 television sets. Programming CBS Sports Network televises original programming, features, talk shows and documentaries as well as extensive women's sports coverage. Its regular season and championship event coverage draws from every major collegiate athletic conference and division, in addition to nine NCAA championships. CBS Sports Network televises 35 men's and women's college sports including football, basketball, baseball, ultimate, hockey, lacrosse, soccer, wrestling and volleyball from every major conference. The network holds multi-media and marketing rights for the Mountain West Conference, the Atlantic 10 Conference, Conference USA, the Patriot League, Army football and Navy football. In April 2006, the network organized the first Collegiate Nationals, a festival of championships dedicated to crowning champions in a wide variety of collegiate action sports such as snowboarding, wakeboarding and beach volleyball. More than 1,000 competitors converged on Reno-Tahoe to compete, the largest number ever for an event of its kind. For its second installment in 2007, the Collegiate Nationals added sports and other events such as national film and music competitions, as well as a second venue ‚Äì San Diego. The third year, 2008, brought further changes, as the winter sports events were moved to the Keystone Resort near Boulder, Colorado and competitive eating was added. In the fall of 2006, CSTV and Comcast launched the MountainWest Sports Network (colloquially known as The Mtn.), a network focusing exclusively on the Mountain West Conference. The relation with the network also gave CSTV exclusive online and broadcasting rights to Notre Dame's game at Air Force on November 11, 2006 ‚Äì which caused controversy since CSTV did not have carriage as widely distributed as other networks that have aired Notre Dame games. The Irish did not revisit a Mountain West team until a 2013 game at Air Force, which once again aired on CBSSN. =2010s= On April 3, 2012, CBS Sports Network premiered Rome, a sports news and talk program hosted by nationally syndicated radio host Jim Rome; Rome had recently left ESPN and his previous show, Jim Rome Is Burning, after signing a new contract with CBS Sports. Rome ended in March 2015, but the channel subsequently announced in October 2017 that it will add a television simulcast of his radio program, The Jim Rome Show, beginning January 2, 2018. On June 7, 2012, CBS Sports Network began to air the remaining games of the American Hockey League's 2012 Calder Cup Final between the Norfolk Admirals and the Toronto Marlies, starting with Game 3. On July 26, 2012, the network signed a deal with the United Football League ‚Äì a second-tier professional football league that began play in October 2009 ‚Äì to televise its games for the 2012 season. The UFL paid for all production expenses and received no rights fee from CBS Sports Network for the broadcasts.\\"Agent: Three UFL players haven't been paid yet,\\" from The Virginian-Pilot, March 10, 2012 The league lasted approximately four weeks on CBS Sports Network before suspending operations halfway through the season. In September 2012, CBS Sports Network introduced NFL Monday QB, a weekly NFL recap show. In September 2013, the network expanded its supplemental NFL coverage with That Other Pre-Game Show, a four-hour \\"fan- focused\\" program positioned as an interactive, \\"casual\\" counterpart to other pre-game shows, hosted by Adam Schein, Bart Scott, Amy Trask, and Brandon Tierney. On April 26, 2013, the network announced that it had signed a deal with the GEICO Motorcycle AMA Pro Road Racing Series for the remainder of the 2013 and the 2014 seasons. The network aired flag to flag coverage for the races as well as live coverage for several of the races. The network broadcast the FIA WTCC Race of the United States from Sonoma Raceway on September 8, 2013. On December 2, 2013, CBS Sports Network announced that it was to begin simulcasting the Boomer and Carton (now Boomer and Gio) morning show from then co-owned sports talk radio station WFAN in New York City in January 2014. In October 2014, CBS Sports Network launched a new talk show, We Need To Talk, which became the first, and only, nationally televised all-female sports panel show. Regular panellists include former professional boxer Laila Ali, former professional basketball player Lisa Leslie and USTA President Katrina Adams. In August 2015, the network premiered Time to Schein, a new program hosted by Adam Schein. In July 2017, the network announced a new documentary series, Four Sides of the Story, to examine notable moments in sports from four perspectives each; the series premiere focused on the Villanova Wildcats' buzzer beater at the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game. CBS Sports Network was one of three cable broadcasters of the Alliance of American Football‚Äîa second-tier developmental football league, alongside NFL Network and TNT. A weekly game and one playoff game were assigned to CBSSN. As was the case with the UFL, the AAF paid CBS Sports Network for the airtime; the AAF abruptly ceased operations before the season ended. On April 4, 2019, the 3-on-3 basketball league Big3 announced that it would move to CBS and CBS Sports Network for its 2019 season. CBSSN will air at least 25 hours of coverage, including coverage of the league's draft. In November 2019, it was reported that CBS Sports had acquired the U.S. English-language broadcast rights to the UEFA Champions League beginning in the 2021-22 season, with CBS Sports Network expected to be incorporated into the coverage. =2020s= On January 9, 2020, the Mountain West Conference announced that it had reached a new six-year deal with CBS and Fox Sports for its top-tier basketball and football rights. CBS Sports Network will remain the conference's primary broadcaster with 23 football games and 23 men's basketball games per-season, and there will be an option for selected games and the conference men's basketball championship to air on CBS, and events in Olympic sports to air on CBS Sports Network beginning in 2021. The Mountain West football championship and Boise State home games will move to a Fox network. CBS Sports Network acquired a package of World of Outlaws events from June 20 to July 4. On September 11, 2020, Bellator MMA announced that its events would move to CBS Sports Network moving forward, after having previously aired on Paramount Network. Both are sisters to CBS Sports Network via the formation of ViacomCBS, while Paramount Network is in the process of abandoning non- scripted development in favor of films.

The film stars Walter Slezak as the titular Michael, the young assistant and model to the artist Claude Zoret (Benjamin Christensen). Along with Different From the Others (1919) and Sex in Chains (1928), Michael is widely considered a landmark in gay silent cinema. The film is based on Herman Bang's 1902 novel Mika√´l. It is the second screen adaptation of the book, the first being The Wings, made eight years prior by director Mauritz Stiller. Michael, however, follows Bang's storyline much more closely than the earlier film version. Plot A famous painter named Claude Zoret falls in love with one of his models, Michael, and for a time the two live happily as partners. Zoret is considerably older than Michael, and as they age, Michael begins to drift from him, although Zoret is completely blind to this. When a bankrupt countess comes to Zoret to have a portrait made ‚Äî with the real intent of seducing him and swindling his money ‚Äî she finds Michael to be more receptive to her advances. At her lead, the two quickly become a couple and she immediately begins using Michael to steal from Zoret. When Zoret discovers what has been going on, he is crushed and his work suffers terribly. Michael sells the painting of himself that Zoret made and gave to him as a gift, and steals and sells the sketches Zoret made of their time in Algiers, where they first fell in love. Zoret begins work on his masterpiece: a large-scale painting of a man lying on a beach, using Algiers as a background, depicting \\"a man who has lost everything\\", as one character put it on first sight of the work. After completing the painting, Zoret falls ill. Charles Switt sits beside Zoret on his deathbed. Switt had always loved Zoret, and has stayed with him throughout, never criticizing Michael for fear of hurting his unrequited love. Switt sends a message to Michael, telling him that Zoret is dying and to come at once, but the Countess prevents him from getting it. Zoret's last words, which also serve as the prologue to the film, are \\"Now I can die in peace, for I have seen true love.\\" Cast * Walter Slezak as Michael * Benjamin Christensen as Claude Zoret * Nora Gregor as Countess Lucia Zamikow * Robert Garrison as Charles Switt, journalist * Max Auzinger as Jules, principal steward of the house * Didier Aslan as Duke de Monthieu * Alexander Murski as Mr. Adelsskjold * Grete Mosheim as Mrs. Alice Adelsskjold * Karl Freund as LeBlanc, art dealer * Wilhelmine Sandrock as Widow de Monthieu Release Michael was shown in Berlin on 26 September 1924. Critical reception and legacy Initial responses to the film included some major objections. Film critic Mordaunt Hall, writing in December 1926 for The New York Times, pronounced: > \\"Chained\\" is a dull piece of work, redeemed only by some artistic scenes and > Benjamin Christensen's able portrayal of Claude Zoret, an artist...The > actress cast as a princess does not screen well, and Walter Slezak, who > figures as the youth, gives a stilted, amateurish impersonation.New York > Times film review of Michael, by Mordaunt Hall. December 15, 1926. He criticizes the film for what he perceived as opportunism for a German director to take a \\"fling at France\\" by filming less than favorable national figures on the screen (Zoret was purportedly based on French sculptor Auguste RodinMark Nash, Dreyer BFI Publishing (October 1977). p. 7). The homosexual undertones also upset reviewers, since \\"Michael [was] one of the very few big- budget mainstream studio productions from the silent period that [dealt] with homosexuality; although it remains implicit, it was readily apparent to many contemporaries.\\"Casper Tybjerg, The Makers of Movies: Authors, Subjects, Personalities, Agents? in Visual authorship: creativity and intentionality in media, Northern Lights vol. 3., Torben Kragh Grodal, Bente Larsen, Iben Thorving Laursen (ed.), Museum Tusculanum Press, 2005. pp. 58‚Äì59. After Dreyer had further established himself as a prominent director through his later films ‚Äì most notably The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), which is considered a masterpiece ‚Äì critics began to reevaluate Michael. From the perspective of auteur theory, this film exhibits many trademark elements of Dreyer's personal directorial style, such as his use of close-ups in a \\"way that... makes a tranquil picture of overwhelming feelings.\\"David Thomson, The New Biographical Dictionary of Film, 2002. It has also been suggested that the film reflects personal feelings harbored by Dreyer after a purported homosexual affair. The film has been cited to have influenced several directors. Alfred Hitchcock drew upon motifs from Michael for his script for The Blackguard (1925).Michael Walker, Hitchcock's Motifs, Amsterdam University Press (1 January 2006). p. 329 The film is considered an important early work in gay silent cinema.Vito Russo, The Celluloid Closet: Homosexuality in the Movies HarperCollins Publishers; 1st Edition (July 1981). p.22  Home media release  The film was released in Region 2 by Eureka Entertainment Ltd. as part of the Masters of Cinema Series on 25 October 2004 with the title Michael.Amazon.co.uk product details Two months later on 14 December, Kino International released a Region 1 version with the title Carl Theodor Dreyer's Michael.IMDb DVD release details Kino International retains the copyright in the United States.

The Leland Stanford Junior University, et al., No. 740309 (Cal. Super. Ct. Feb. 27, 1995), was a case in which the Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California ruled that Stanford University's speech code violated the freedom of speech rights of its students guaranteed under California's Leonard Law. Arguments On May 2, 1994, Robert J. Corry and nine other Stanford students filed suit arguing that Stanford's speech code violated California's Leonard Law. The 1992 law had applied the First Amendment to all of California's secular private colleges and universities. In addition to Stanford University itself, the defendants included Judicial Affairs Officer Sally Cole, President Gerhard Casper, and Board of Trustees President John Freidenrich. The defendants made two arguments in the suit. First, they argued that Stanford's speech code was protected under Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, as the code only prohibited fighting words. Secondly, they argued that the Leonard Law actually violated Stanford's First Amendment rights, as Stanford is a private entity. Ruling On February 27, 1995, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Peter G. Stone ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. Stone ruled that the Stanford speech code restricted more than just fighting words, by including insulting speech. Therefore, using the Leonard Law and Chaplinsky, the code was illegal. He ruled further that even if he accepted the argument that the speech code only restricted fighting words, it was still illegal using the Leonard Law and R. A. V. v. City of St. Paul as the code restricted speech based on content. Stone also ruled that the Leonard Law was constitutional, essentially because it did not in any way restrict the speech of the university as a corporate entity. The university remained free to express its abhorrence of racial and other forms of prejudice. He ruled that the law expanded, rather than contracted, the range of legally permissible speech by protecting the free speech rights of students without abridging those of the university itself. To be able to express its own opposition to prejudice, he ruled that it was not necessary for the university to have the power to prohibit speech with which it strongly disagreed.

It was initially developed by the group of Prof. Reinhart Ahlrichs at the University of Karlsruhe. In 2007, TURBOMOLE GmbH, founded by R. Ahlrichs, F. Furche, C. H√§ttig, W. Klopper, M. Sierka, and F. Weigend, took over the responsibility for the coordination of the scientific development of TURBOMOLE program, for which the company holds all copy and intellectual property rights. In 2018 David P. Tew joined the TURBOMOLE GmbH. Since 1987, this program is one of the useful tools as it involves in many fields of research including heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysis, organic and inorganic chemistry, spectroscopy as well as biochemistry. This can be illustrated by citation records of Ahlrich's 1989 publication which is more than 6700 times as of 18 July 2020. In the year 2014, the second Turbomole article has been published. The number of citations from both papers indicates that the Turbomole's user base is expanding. General features Turbomole was developed in 1987 and turned into a mature program system under the control of Reinhart Ahlrichs and his collaborators. Turbomole can perform a large-scale quantum chemical simulations of molecules, clusters, and later periodic solids. Gaussian basis sets are used in Turbomole. The functionality of the program concentrates extensively on the electronic structure methods with effective cost-performance characteristics such as density functional theory, second‚Äìorder M√∏ller-Plesset and coupled cluster theory. Aside from energies and structures, an assortment of optical, electrical, and magnetic properties are available from analytical energy derivative for electronic ground and excited states. However, up to the year 2000, Turbomole was only limited to the calculation of molecules in gas phase, thus, COSMO has been implemented in the Turbomole in a cooperative initiative of BASF AG and Bayer AG. Turbomole version 6.5 releasing in the year 2013, comes with post-Kohn-Sham calculations within the random-phase approximation. Turbomole also comes with another significant additions including nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, ultra-efficient higher order CC methods, new density functionals and periodic calculations. TmoleX is available as a graphical user interface for Turbomole allowing the user to perform the entire workflow of a quantum chemical investigation ranging from building of an initial structure to the interpretation of the results.

In 1943, Stravinsky had begun work on rescoring his ballet The Rite of Spring. Although the project was left incomplete, his revisit to this earlier composition appears to have influenced the symphony. The ostinatos and shock tactics of the last movement, for example, recalls the \\"Glorification of the Chosen One\\" and \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" from The Rite, and some woodwind passages are reminiscent of the ballet's introduction. On the other hand, there are passages forecasting the opera The Rake's Progress, notably the openings of the slow movement and the finale.Eric Walter White, Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works, 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), p. 435. A typical performance of the symphony lasts 20‚Äì25 minutes: The symphony is scored for an orchestra of piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 3 clarinets in B and A (3rd doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets in C, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, piano, harp, violins I & II, violas, cellos, and double basses. Stravinsky, who rarely acknowledged extramusical inspirations for his music, referred to the composition as his 'war symphony'.Charles M. Joseph, Stravinsky Inside Out (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2001), p. 120. He claimed the symphony as a direct response to events of the Second World War in both Europe and Asia. The first movement was inspired by a documentary on Japanese scorched earth tactics in China. The third movement deals with footage of German soldiers goosestepping and the Allied forces' mounting success.Michael Oliver, Igor Stravinsky (London: Phaidon Press Ltd, 1995), pp.152, 154‚Äì6. Material is drawn from projects that Stravinsky had abandoned or reorganized. The piano's presence in the first movement stems from a piano concerto that was left incomplete. Music for harp is prominent in the second movement, using themes he had written for the film adaptation of Franz Werfel's novel The Song of Bernadette. Stravinsky was initially informally approached for the writing of the film score. On 15 February 1943 he started writing music for the \\"Apparition of the Virgin\\" scene. In the event, no contract was ever signed with him, and the project went to Alfred Newman, who won an Oscar.Stephen Walsh. Stravinsky: The Second Exile: France and America 1934‚Äì1971, p. 144. Retrieved 1 November 2014 The third movement unites the first two movements by giving equal emphasis to piano and harp.Eric Walter White, Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works, 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), p. 429. In contrast to Stravinsky's earlier Symphony in C, the Symphony in Three Movements is much more turbulent and chromatic. While the Symphony in C is based on abstract ideas, his later symphony makes use of pressing social concerns. From a purely musical standpoint, the Symphony hearkens back to Stravinsky's earlier styles of composition while remaining an outstanding achievement of neoclassicism.Eric Walter White, Stravinsky: The Composer and his Works, 2nd edition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), p. 435.

This dye can be easily hydrolyzed with acids, splitting off the acetal group responsible for its solubility in nonpolar solvents, and yielding a water-soluble form which is easy to extract to water. Like a similar methyl orange dye, it changes color to red in acidic pH. It can be easily detected in the fuel at levels as low as 0.3 ppm by extraction to a diluted hydrochloric acid, allowing detection of the red diesel added into motor diesel in amounts as low as 2-3%. Solvent Yellow 124 is intended to be difficult to remove from the fuel in an economical way. The Customs, familiar with various tricks including dual fuel systems with hidden fuel tanks, will take samples from the fuel lines to the engine itself if such equipment is suspected in the car. As the amount of Solvent Yellow 124 added to the fuel is known, by measuring its content in the fuel it is possible to calculate how much of the low-taxed fuel was added to the legal one. Heating oil detection in Diesel fuel Concerns The UK government expressed concerns about the possibility of \\"laundering\\" the dye out of \\"illicit\\" fuel, hampering the detection. Denmark expressed concerns about the dye's toxicity. Euromarker is intended to be replaced later by newer technology markers, such as biological markers or fuel markers with non- destructive analytical methods.

An undrafted rookie for the New York Giants in 2005, Blackburn spent most of the season as a backup linebacker and special teamer. In Super Bowl XLII, Blackburn had a costly penalty on a punt return as he was the extra man on the field on a 12-man-on-the-field penalty. After the play, New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick challenged the play that the Giants had 12 men on the field and won. The penalty resulted in a first down, but the Patriots did not score on that drive after a failed 4th down conversion. As a result, the Giants improved their field position by 20 yards, so the penalty actually benefited the team. The Giants went on to win the game. For 2010, he was elected as a team captain by his teammates, representing special teams. After the season, he became an unrestricted free agent. He was re-signed on November 29, 2011. In Week 13 in a game against the Green Bay Packers, Blackburn recorded an interception against Aaron Rodgers in his own end. In the fourth quarter of Super Bowl XLVI, Blackburn recorded an interception against Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, the lone turnover of the game. The play was vital to winning the Super Bowl. He also had six tackles. =Carolina Panthers= Blackburn agreed to a two-year contract with the Carolina Panthers on March 27, 2013. Blackburn played a part in Carolina's defense in 2013, complementing Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly with 33 tackles and 2 stuffs in the regular season and playoffs. On March 10, 2015, Blackburn became a free agent. Coaching career During the off season before the 2016 season, Blackburn was brought in as a special teams coaching intern.

Program structure The program is built of two modules: crystal and properties. The crystal program is dedicated to perform the SCF calculations, the geometry optimizations, and the frequency calculations for the structures given in input. At the end of the SCF process, the program crystal writes information on the crystalline system and its wave function as unformatted sequential data in Fortran unit 9, and as formatted data in Fortran unit 98. One-electron properties and wave function analysis can be computed from the SCF wave function by running the program properties. The main advantage of the crystal code is due to the deep and optimized exploitation of symmetry, at all levels of calculation (SCF as well gradients and vibrational frequencies calculations). This allows significant reduction of the computational cost for periodic calculations. Note that while the symmetry generally reduces to identity in large molecules, large crystalline system usually show many symmetry operators.

Social disruption implies a radical transformation, in which the old certainties of modern society are falling away and something quite new is emerging. Social disruption might be caused through natural disasters, massive human displacements, rapid economic, technological and demographic change but also due to controversial policy-making. Social disruptions are for example rising sea levels that are creating new landscapes, drawing new world maps whose key lines are not traditional boundaries between nation-states but elevations above sea level. On the local level, an example would be the closing of a community grocery store, which might cause social disruption in a community by removing a \\"meeting ground\\" for community members to develop interpersonal relationships and community solidarity.  Results of social disruption  \\"We are wandering aimlessly and dispassionately, arguing for and against, but the one statement on which we are, beyond all differences and over many continents, to be able to agree on, is: \\"I can no longer understand the world\\". Social disruptions often lead to five social symptoms: Frustration, Democratic Disconnection, Fragmentation, Polarization and Escalation. Studies from the last decade show, that our societies have become more fragmented and less coherent (e.g. Bishop 2008), neighbourhoods turning into little states, organizing themselves to defend the local politics and culture against outsiders (Walzer 1983; Bauman 2017) and increasingly identifying through ways of voting, lifestyle or wellbeing (e.g. Sch√§fer 2015). Especially people on the more right and left political spectrum are more likely to say it is important to them to live in a place where most people share their political views and have similar interests (Pew 2014). Hence, citizens become alienated from democratic consensus (Foa and Munk 2016; Levitsky and Ziblatt 2018) and tend to assume that their opponents believe more extreme things than they really do (Iyengar et al. 2012). Moreover, fear of being identified as unqualified, denied value and dignity and for that reason marginalized, excluded or outcast, is giving rise to a widespread disenchantment with the idea that the future will improve the human condition and a mistrust in the ability of nation-states to make this happen (Pew 2015; Bauman 2017). At the same time, accelerations in liberal progression, globalization and migration flows have led to increasing polarized contestations about national identities - a volatile and critical social state, prone to conflict escalation (e.g. hate crimes after Brexit vote, incident at far-right rally in Charlottesville, USA).  Policy making  \\"It is unclear how to achieve policy changes of any kind in a polarized society that has few shared facts and whose civic muscles are atrophying.\\" International but also local challenges force our societies to find solutions and make decisions on controversial issues in an accelerated manner. The complexity of such decisions is not only mirrored in the aim to tackle a multi-causality of root causes, it also faces a high degree of uncertainty as regard to its impact. Hence, due to the growing separation between the world of public opinion on the one hand, and the world of problem solving on the other (Mair 2009), it is very likely that political decisions further polarize our societies. The explanation is that citizens evaluate disruptive developments and related policy changes on a two-way level, on the personal interests and comfort, as well on its perceived impact on their social identity and community (Ryan and Deci 2000; Haidt 2012). If a policy change reflects the substantive representation of the median voter, is something that just does not matter to citizens in regard to their acceptance of decisions (Esaiasson et al. 2017). This can produce multi facet conflicts over interests, facts and norms between supporters and opponents (Itten 2017). Simultaneously, the capacity of political parties and actors of civil society, to bridge that divide, is declining (Mair 2009). In such a situations, social psychology tells us that citizens who feel uncomfortable will hold tighter to the assumptions that make them feel secure (Podziba 2014). Especially in public policy disputes, parties are hardly giving up their assumptions voluntarily, and citizens begin to masquerade their true individual conflict of interest (e.g. devaluation of property; insecurity) with more normative conflict of interest (e.g. protection of nature; protection of culture). Such distorted behaviour remarkably increases at times citizens or communities feel that a policy change is threatening their way of living.  Bridging social capital  In the light of the increasing social divisions and democratic disconnection, Putnam and Feldstein (2004) foresaw the importance of creating ‚Äúbridging social capital‚Äù, e.g. ties that link groups across a greater social distance. As the authors elaborate, the creation of robust social capital takes time and effort. It develops largely through extensive and time- consuming face-to-face conversation between two individuals or small groups of people. Only then there is the chance to build the trust and mutual understanding that characterizes the foundation of social capital. In no way, Putnam and Feldstein write, it is possible to create social capital instantaneous, anonymous or en masse. Furthermore, building social capital among people who already share a reservoir of similar cultural referents, ethnicity, personal experience or moral identity etc. is qualitatively different. Homogeneity makes connective strategies easier, however, a society with only homogenous social capital risks looking like Bosnia or Belfast. Hence, bridging social capital is especially important for reconciling democracy and diversity. Yet, bridging social capital among diverse social group is intrinsically less likely to develop automatically.

Founded in 1952, this partnership of educational and professional institutions, social welfare agencies, and private citizens is recognized by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation as the sole accrediting agency for social work education in the United States.  History  The Summer School of Philanthropy was founded in 1898 by the Charity Organization Society of New York and was soon followed by additional training schools for social workers in Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, and Philadelphia. In 1919 the Association of Training Schools for Professional Social Workers was established (later the American Association of Schools of Social Work, or AASSW). It established formal accrediting procedures in 1932, although the American Association of Medical Social Workers and the American Association of Psychiatric Social Workers had accrediting processes in place for their particular specialties. In 1937 AASSW's move to limit its membership to graduate schools caused state higher education institutions to form the National Association of Schools of Social Administration (NASSA). NASSA representatives felt that social worker shortages demanded a more generalist approach to social work education. The two systems, however, frustrated the education community and resulted in the removal of accreditation authority from both groups. This move led AASSW, NASSA, and others to establish the National Council on Social Work Education in 1946. This group studied the issues and produced Social Work Education in the United States. This report recommended that a sole organization be founded that would permit the many elements within the social work profession to participate in setting and maintaining accreditation criteria. Thus, AASSW and NASSA were dissolved, and CSWE was born in January 1952 with the following statement of purpose: ‚Äúto promote the development of sound programs of social work education in the United States, its territories and possessions, and Canada‚Äù. Helen R. Wright, dean of the University of Chicago's School of Social Service Administration, became CSWE's first president, and Katherine A. Kendall, who had worked for the Children's Bureau, the United Nations, and AASSW, was appointed CSWE's executive secretary. In the beginning CSWE accredited only master's programs in social work, because a perception existed‚Äîalthough it was not universally supported‚Äîthat preparation for professional social work practice was the province of master's programs. CSWE also accredited Canadian master's of social work programs until the Canadian Association of Schools of Social Work (now known as the Canadian Association for Social Work Education) took over accreditation of those programs in 1970. However, CSWE continued to accredit Canadian MSW programs on request until 1983. In October 1961 the CSWE board adopted Social Welfare Content in Undergraduate Education as an aid to higher education institutions that wished to develop such programs. In 1973, CSWE issued accreditation standards covering content in the social work curriculum, staffing, and organization of social welfare programs at the undergraduate level, and in 1974, the National Commission on Accrediting formally authorized CSWE to accredit baccalaureate social work programs. It issued a revised curriculum policy statement in 1982 that included curriculum policy for BSW programs (CSWE, 1982). The CSWE Educational Policy and Accreditation Standards were last revised in 2015. Because CSWE's focus has been on the quality of education for individuals intending to engage in professional social work practice, it never has accredited social work programs at the associate's or doctoral level. The CSWE is the only organization that provides accreditation for all online baccalaureate and master's social work programs in the United States. The association was originally based in New York City, moving to Washington, DC, in 1984 and to Alexandria, Virginia, in 1990. Conferences In September 2013, Darla Coffey, CSWE President, organized the first White House Briefing for Social Work Education coordinated through the White House Office of Public Engagement. Presentations were given by federal officials from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

All of them belong in the subfamily Centropodinae and the genus Centropus. Unlike many Old World cuckoos, coucals are not brood parasites, though they do have their own reproductive peculiarity: all members of the genus are (to varying degrees) sex-role reversed, so that the smaller male provides most of the parental care. At least one coucal species, the black coucal, is polyandrous. Some species (Centropus phasianinus) have the male investing more in incubation and parental care. Recent DNA evidence suggests that they should be raised to family status, as Centropodidae. Description Many coucals have a long claw on their hind toe (hallux). The genus name from Greek kentron, a spike and pous for foot describe this hallux claw. The feet have minute spurs and this is responsible for the German term for coucals Sporenkuckucke. The common name is perhaps derived from the French coucou and alouette (for the long lark like claw). (Cuvier, in Newton 1896) The length of the claw can be about 68-76% of the tarsus length in the African black coucal C. grillii and lesser coucal C. bengalensis. Only the short-toed coucal C. rectunguis is an exception with the hallux claw of only 23% of the tarsus length. Thread like feather structures (elongated sheaths of the growing feathers that are sometimes termed trichoptiles) are found on the head and neck of hatchlings and can be as long as 20mm. Nestlings can look spiny. Many are opportunistic predators, Centropus phasianus is known to attack birds caught in mist nets while white-browed coucals Centropus superciliosus are attracted to smoke from grass fires where they forage for insects and small mammals escaping from the fire. Coucals generally make nests inside dense vegetation and they usually have the top covered but some species have the top open. Pheasant coucal Centropus phasianinus, greater coucal C. sinensis and Madagascar coucal C. toulou sometimes build an open nest while some species always build open nests (the bay coucal C. celebensis) Some coucal species have been seen to fly while carrying their young.

It is a small pie consisting of curry with chicken and potatoes in a deep-fried or baked pastry shell. The curry is quite thick to prevent it from oozing out of the snack. Although the origins of this snack are uncertain, the snack is believed to have originated in Malaya due in part to the various influences of the British Cornish pasty, the Portuguese empanada and the Indian samosa during the colonization era. The curry puff is one of several \\"puff\\" type pastries with different fillings, though now it is by far the most common. Other common varieties include eggs, sardines, and onions or sweet fillings such as yam. There are a few version of the curry puffs depending which ethnicity made them. Curry puffs are enjoyed throughout Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and Thailand. It also shares many similarities with the empanada , a popular pastry in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries. It is also very similar to the Chinese Crispy fry dumpling popular snack in Fujian filled with Chinese garlic chives or crush peanut at Guangdong eaten during Chinese New Year. The Chinese Malaysian applied the Chinese pastry method of the crispy dumpling replaced with the curry and created the spiral with multi-layer version. Indonesia Indonesian pastel with vegetables and beef inside In Indonesia, a curry puff is known as a pastel, although it does not necessarily contain any curry powder. Pastels are derived from the Portuguese influence in Indonesia. It refers to a pie of crust made from thin pastry, filled with meat (usually chicken) mixed with vegetables (chopped carrot and beans), rice vermicelli, and sometimes egg, then deep fried in vegetable oil. It is consumed as a snack and is commonly sold in Indonesian traditional markets. The similar North Sulawesi version replaces the thin flour pie crust with bread, and is filled with spicy cakalang (skipjack tuna). This variation of the snack is called panada. This snack is very popular during Ramadhan. The similar Riau Islands version of curry puff is called epok-epok. Malaysia In Malaysia, curry puffs are commonly known as karipap and sold freshly fried at many Malay, Chinese and Indian food stalls and even at trendy cafes. Another Malay version of this snack is known as epok-epok and teh-teh which is smaller than the curry puff. The curry puffs from Indian bakeries differ from epok-epok in the use of 'layered' pastry that creates a flaky crust. Other varieties of the epok epok are filled with a half boiled egg instead of chicken. Another alternative is tinned sardines. There are also vegetarian curry puffs that are in fact not spicy and made from shredded radish, tofu, potatoes and grated carrots. They are often eaten with sweet chili sauce. There is also relatively large and nice looking version of curry puff called shell curry puff sold in shopping malls of Isetan and AEON and others in Malaysia. Manufacturers have developed a version of the curry puff that can be frozen and later reheated by the consumer. These are suitable for the export market and can be produced in volume for shipment to various regions, such as the Middle East, where there is demand. In addition, new fillings have been experimented with, including tuna and black pepper. In Indian food stalls in Malaysia, it is quite common to find vegetarian curry puffs with potatoes, carrots and onions as fillings. Myanmar (Burma) The curry puff is a common snack sold in Chinatowns and tea shops throughout Myanmar, where is known as be tha mont (; lit. \\"duck pastry\\"). The traditional filling is duck meat and potato spiced with garam masala, onions, powdered chili peppers, garlic, and ginger. Singapore Curry puffs are commonly seen in Singapore's Pasar Malams and other stalls in shopping centres. Additionally, the aforementioned epok-epok is a popular variation in some of Singapore's hawker centres, usually amongst Malay stalls. Alternatively, the more common type of curry puff has a thick or flaky English-style crust, with a mixture of Chinese and Indian styles in the filling. They may also be categorised into hand-made or mass-produced machine-made puffs. Both variations are popular in Singapore, although some might argue that the former is typically more delicious. Other puff snacks modelled on the curry puff concept have also been introduced. For example, 1A Crispy Puff also sells puffs with yam, durian, corn, red bean, nata de coco, grass jelly, bird's nest and even custard fillings. Besides the more \\"exotic\\" fillings mentioned, there are also more conventional flavours which are quite popular with the locals. These puffs are readily available in Singapore, which include sardine, black- pepper chicken and tuna fillings. For example, Pie Connection sells these hand-made puffs. In Singapore, Old Chang Kee has been selling curry puffs for over 60 years and now has outlets all over Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia and UK. Other well-known brands include 1A Crispy Puff and Sim Sun Pastries. Polar Puffs and Cakes introduced a version of the curry puff that uses Western puff pastry, which has a different taste and shape. Thailand Thai karipap normally only contains chicken, potato, onion, and curry powder In Thailand, a curry puff is known as a karipap (‡∏Å‡∏∞‡∏´‡∏£‡∏µ‡πà‡∏õ‡∏±‡πä‡∏ö). Assumed to have been adapted from Portuguese cuisine pastel, it arrived in Thailand since the Ayutthaya period in the reign of King Narai (1633‚Äì1688) by Portuguese- Japanese-Bengali lady Maria Guyomar de Pinha like many kinds of Thai desserts such as thong yip, thong yot, foi thong and luk chup. Notable areas where karipap is popular are Amphoe Muak Lek, and Saraburi province in central Thailand, where durian filling is used.

However, with the discovery of Venus's extremely hostile surface environment, attention has largely shifted towards the colonization of the Moon and Mars instead, with proposals for Venus focused on colonies floating in the upper-middle atmosphereDaniel Oberhaus and Alex Pasternack, \\"Why We Should Build Cloud Cities on Venus\\", Motherboard, Feb 2 2015 (accessed March 26, 2017). and on terraforming. Reasons for colonization Space colonization is a step beyond space exploration, and implies the permanent or long-term presence of humans in an environment outside Earth. Colonization of space was claimed by Stephen Hawking to be the best way to ensure the survival of humans as a species. Other reasons for colonizing space include economic interests, long-term scientific research best carried out by humans as opposed to robotic probes, and sheer curiosity. Venus is the second largest terrestrial planet and Earth's closest neighbor, which makes it a potential target. Advantages Scale representations of Venus and the Earth shown next to each other. Venus is only slightly smaller. Venus has certain similarities to Earth which, if not for the hostile conditions, might make colonization easier in many respects in comparison with other possible destinations. These similarities, and its proximity, have led Venus to be called Earth's \\"sister planet\\". At present it has not been established whether the gravity of Mars, 0.38 times that of the Earth, would be sufficient to avoid bone decalcification and loss of muscle tone experienced by astronauts living in a micro-g environment. In contrast, Venus is close in size and mass to the Earth, resulting in a similar surface gravity (0.904 g) that would likely be sufficient to prevent the health problems associated with weightlessness. Most other space exploration and colonization plans face concerns about the damaging effect of long-term exposure to fractional g or zero gravity on the human musculoskeletal system. Venus's relative proximity makes transportation and communications easier than for most other locations in the Solar System. With current propulsion systems, launch windows to Venus occur every 584 days, compared to the 780 days for Mars.David S. F. Portree, Humans to Mars: Fifty Years of Mission Planning, 1950‚Äì2000, NASA Monographs in Aerospace History Series, Number 21, February 2001. Available as NASA SP-2001-4521. Flight time is also somewhat shorter; the Venus Express probe that arrived at Venus in April 2006 spent slightly over five months en route, compared to nearly six months for Mars Express. This is because at closest approach, Venus is from Earth (approximated by perihelion of Earth minus aphelion of Venus) compared to for Mars (approximated by perihelion of Mars minus aphelion of Earth) making Venus the closest planet to Earth. Venus's atmosphere is made mostly out of carbon dioxide. Because nitrogen and oxygen are lighter than carbon- dioxide, breathable-air-filled balloons will float at a height of about . At this height, the temperature is a manageable . At higher, it is a temperate (see ). The atmosphere also provides the various elements required for human life and agriculture: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. Additionally, the upper atmosphere could provide protection from harmful solar radiation comparable to the protection provided by Earth's atmosphere. The Atmosphere of Mars, as well as the Moon provide little such protection.  Difficulties  bar by 50 kilometers Venus also presents several significant challenges to human colonization. Surface conditions on Venus are difficult to deal with: the temperature at the equator averages around , higher than the melting point of lead, which is 327 ¬∞C. The atmospheric pressure on the surface is also at least ninety times greater than on Earth, which is equivalent to the pressure experienced under a kilometer of water. These conditions have caused missions to the surface to be extremely brief: the Soviet Venera 5 and Venera 6 probes were crushed by high pressure while still 18 km above the surface. Following landers such as Venera 7 and Venera 8 succeeded in transmitting data after reaching the surface, but these missions were brief as well, surviving no more than a single hour on the surface. Furthermore, water, in any form, is almost entirely absent from Venus. The atmosphere is devoid of molecular oxygen and is primarily carbon dioxide. In addition, the visible clouds are composed of corrosive sulfuric acid and sulfur dioxide vapor. Exploration and research Over 20 successful space missions have visited Venus since 1962. The last European probe was ESA's Venus Express, which was in polar orbit around the planet from 2006 to 2014. A Japanese probe, Akatsuki, failed in its first attempt to orbit Venus, but successfully reinserted itself into orbit on 7 December 2015. Other low-cost missions have been proposed to further explore the planet's atmosphere, as the area above the surface where gas pressure is at the same level as Earth has not yet been thoroughly explored. Aerostat habitats and floating cities Hypothetical floating outpost studying colonization of Venus around 50 km above the surface supported by a torus full of hydrogen At least as early as 1971 Based on Technica Molodezhi TM - 9 1971, the book references following link . Soviet scientists have suggested that rather than attempting to colonize Venus' hostile surface, humans might attempt to colonize the Venerian atmosphere. Geoffrey A. Landis of NASA's Glenn Research Center has summarized the perceived difficulties in colonizing Venus as being merely from the assumption that a colony would need to be based on the surface of a planet: Landis has proposed aerostat habitats followed by floating cities, based on the concept that breathable air (21:79 oxygen/nitrogen mixture) is a lifting gas in the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, with over 60% of the lifting power that helium has on Earth.; draft version of the full paper available at NASA Technical Reports Server (accessed 16 May 2012) In effect, a balloon full of human-breathable air would sustain itself and extra weight (such as a colony) in midair. At an altitude of above the Venerian surface, the environment is the most Earth-like in the Solar System ‚Äì a pressure of approximately 1 atm or 1000 hPa and temperatures in the range. Protection against cosmic radiation would be provided by the atmosphere above, with shielding mass equivalent to Earth's. At the top of the clouds the wind speed on Venus reaches up to , circling the planet approximately every four Earth days, in a phenomenon known as \\"super-rotation\\".Landis, Geoffrey A., Colozza, Anthony, and LaMarre, Christopher M., Atmospheric Flight on Venus (pdf), International Astronautical Federation Congress 2002, paper IAC-02-Q.4.2.03, AIAA-2002-0819, AIAA0, No. 5 Compared to the Venusian solar day of 118 Earth days, colonies freely floating in this region could therefore have a much shorter day-night cycle. Allowing a colony to move freely would also reduce structural stress from the wind than they would experience if tethered to the ground. =Advantages= Because there is not a significant pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the breathable-air balloon, any rips or tears would cause gases to diffuse at normal atmospheric mixing rates rather than an explosive decompression, giving time to repair any such damages. In addition, humans would not require pressurized suits when outside, merely air to breathe, protection from the acidic rain and on some occasions low level protection against heat. Alternatively, two-part domes could contain a lifting gas like hydrogen or helium (extractable from the atmosphere) to allow a higher mass density. Therefore, putting on or taking off suits for working outside would be easier. Working outside the vehicle in non-pressurized suits would also be easier. =Remaining problems= Structural and industrial materials would be hard to retrieve from the surface and expensive to bring from Earth/asteroids. The sulfuric acid itself poses a further challenge in that the colony would need to be constructed of or coated in materials resistant to corrosion by the acid, such as PTFE (a compound consisting wholly of carbon and fluorine). =Studies= In 2015, NASA developed the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC), exploring the possibility of setting up an atmospheric manned mission. Artificial mountains As an alternative to floating cities, it has been proposed that a large artificial mountain, dubbed the \\"Venusian Tower of Babel\\", could be built on the surface of Venus. It would reach up to into the atmosphere where the temperature and pressure conditions are similar to Earth's. Such a structure could be built using autonomous robotic bulldozers and excavators that have been hardened against the extreme temperature and pressure of the Venus atmosphere. Robotic machines would be covered in a layer of heat and pressure shielding ceramics, with internal helium-based heat pumps inside of the machines to cool both an internal nuclear power plant and to keep the internal electronics and motor actuators of the machine cooled to within operating temperature. These machines could be designed to operate for years without external intervention for the purpose of building colossal mountains on Venus to serve as islands of colonization in the skies of Venus.Multiplanetary Society: A New Approach to Terraforming Venus, vol. 12. March 2018 Terraforming Artist's conception of a terraformed Venus. The cloud formations are depicted assuming the planet's rotation has not been sped up. Venus has been the subject of a number of terraforming proposals.Fogg, Martin J. , Terraforming: Engineering Planetary Environments, SAE Press, 1995. , Paper AIAA-2011-7215, AIAA Space 2011 Conference & Exposition, Long Beach CA, Sept. 26-29, 2011. The proposals seek to remove or convert the dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, reduce Venus's surface temperature, and establish a day/night light cycle closer to that of Earth. Many proposals involve deployment of a solar shade or a system of orbital mirrors, for the purpose of reducing insolation and providing light to the dark side of Venus. Another common thread in most proposals involves some introduction of large quantities of hydrogen or water. Proposals also involve either freezing most of Venus's atmospheric CO2, or converting it to carbonates,The Terraforming of Venus urea or other forms.

Style Holsinger's music was characterized by having a variation of different time signatures. Works His works include: *Abram's Pursuit, an overture based on a story of Abram from the Book of Genesis *At The Strongholds of En Gedi *A Childhood Hymn, which is based on the hymnsong \\"Jesus Loves Me\\" *Adagio, composed in memory of a departed friend; an emotional synthesis of joy and pain. *American Faces, an overture celebrating the diversity of America *Ballet Exaltare, a Grade 5 piece written in a somewhat more classical style for Holsinger *Ballet Sacra, a 15-minute work that includes a short choir part in the middle section *Battle Music (2001), a work inspired by Revelations 12:7; ‚ÄúAnd there was war in Heaven ..‚Äù *The Case of the Mysterious Stranger *Cityscapes *Cluster Fluster Bluster March *Coal Mountain Portrait, commissioned by the WV Bandmasters Association for the 2010 WV All-State Band which he conducted in its debut on March 6, 2010 *Consider The Uncommon Man, a memorial work *Divertimented Dances, a series of seven dances composed for the 2006 Massachusetts All-State Festival *Deerpath Dances *The Easter Symphony, a three-movement, 55 minute chorale symphony based on the Passion of Christ *Elegy on an American Folktune: Remembering Erin Suzanne Hutchison *Every Morning New *Falcon Attack! *Fanfare for Brass and Tympani *Fantasy on a Gaelic Hymnsong *Festiva Jubiloso *Fort Canterbury March *The Gathering of the Ranks at Hebron *Gears Pulleys Chains (2005), a playful tribute to the mechanical history of Shelby, Ohio *Graysondance (1995), written for Holsinger's son, Grayson; the piece is characterized by a jazzy mood, featuring walking bass lines *Gmyway's Revenge! (1994) This piece is a three- movement work for symphonic band. It was written for the tenth anniversary of the Greater Milwaukee Youth Wind Ensemble, reflected in the name of the piece. The first movement of the piece is entitled \\"Alla Brashly Bravura: 'Enter the Hero, Sir Gmyway of Vordak,'\\" characterized by its rather whimsical nature. The second movement, \\"Intermezzo? Thoughtso!: 'The Beguiling Countess Adnil,'\\" is a considerable shift in character, beginning with a lonesome flute solo and slowly augmenting to include the rest of the band. The third, and perhaps most infamous (among band students, horn players, esp.), movement is entitled \\"Presto Zoomissimo-issimo-issimo!:'In Pursuit of Rattazinski, der Villain!'\\" It is perpetually kinetic, often characterized by a syncopated 5/4 rhythm. The names of these movements have significance in the context of the premiere of the piece. \\"Vordak\\" is a rearrangement of \\"Dvorak,\\" the surname of the conductor of this piece's premiere. \\"Adnil\\" is simply Dvorak's wife's first name (Linda) spelled backward. Finally, \\"Rattazinski\\" refers to a rival conductor. Gmyway's Revenge is considered a staple of the concert band literature. *Gypsydance *Havendance (1985) overture for concert band, written for Holsinger's daughter, Haven; the piece is arguably the most musically eclectic of the \\"Holsinger children\\" pieces *Helm Toccata *Hero Music (2005), commissioned to celebrate the life of a well loved Tennessee band director *Homage: Three Tapestries, Holsinger's tribute to composer Vaclav Nelhybel *In The Spring, at the Time When Kings Go Off to War A roughly 13 minute piece The composition is based on I Chronicles 20, verses 1 through 3. This short scripture tells of the gathering of King David‚Äôs armies under the command of Joab; the legions attack and siege of the land of the Amonites; the subsequent capture and execution of the Ammonite kings; the plunder and slavery of the surviving foe; and the triumphant return of David‚Äôs army to Jerusalem. This piece has the signature time variations with a main tune not dissimilar to his other work \\"To Tame the Perilous Skies\\" *Lake Canterbury Regatta *Liturgical Dances is subtitled Benedecamus Socii Domine which translates \\"Let us (all), as companions, Praise the Lord!\\" *The Maelstrom, Commissioned for the L'Anse Creuse High School Wind Symphony in Harrison Township, Michigan. *March of the Combat Patrol *Mobbusters! *Nilesdance (1987), written for Holsinger's son, Niles, characterized by a short repeating phrase *On an American Spiritual is based upon the African hymnsong \\"Were you there?\\" *On Ancient Hymns and Festal Dances *\\"On a Hymnsong of Lowell Mason\\" is based on Lowell Mason's 1832 work Olivet (My Faith Looks Up To Thee). *On a Hymnsong of Philip Bliss (1989) is Holsinger's translated American hymn ‚ÄúIt is Well with my Soul‚Äù. It is his largest selling work and has been used in several televised memorial performances in recent years, including commemorative services for the Challenger astronauts, Ronald Reagan, and the fallen heroes of the American armed forces. This piece was written to honor Rev. Steve Edel, the retiring principal of Shady Grove Christian Academy, and was presented to him as a gift by the academy's concert band. *On a Hymnsong of Robert Lowry *On a Southern Hymnsong *On The Grand Prairie Texas *On The Overland Stage to El Paso *One Day In a Small Town... (2004), a four-movement piece commissioned by the Fayette (Mo.) High School Music Boosters for director Roy \\"Skip\\" Vanedelicht after his 25th year at the school. First movement, titled \\"On a Breeze That Drifts About Courthouse Square\\" includes strains from \\"Barnum and Bailey's Favorite\\", the school song from Holsinger's alma mater, Central Methodist University. The song is played by marching band in all parades, and all parades will follow a route that goes around the courthouse square in Fayette. The second movement, titled \\"Dancing and Mischief in Liberty Park\\" is named for a city park located on the south side of the town. The third movement, titled \\"An Immeasurable Hero\\", is in reference to Vandelicht. The fourth movement, titled \\"Chasing the Band Bus on MO240\\" includes \\"Washington and Lee Swing\\", the fight song for Fayette High School. Missouri Route 240 goes through Fayette. *Partita Allegro, for woodwind choir *Peasant Dance Village *Prelude and Rondo (1966), his first published piece. *Prairie Dances It contains many alternating time signatures. *Praises, a six-movement ballet suite *Riding With the Frontier Battalion Commissioned by the Association of Texas Small School Bands for the 2000 ATSSB Symphonic Band. Holsinger conducted the premier performance. *Scaling the North Wall *Scootin‚Äô on Hardrock, a jazz suite for concert band. Commissioned by the Grand Island, NY music program for the Grand Island, NY High School Wind Ensemble. Holsinger conducted the premier performance. *Scrappy Bumptoe's Picture Cards and Ragtag Diary, composed for the Kansas Brass Quintet *Solemn Hymn & Rowdy Dance, debuted at the Virginia District 7 All-District Band Concert on February 5, 2011 by the Senior Symphonic Band *The Song of Moses, a four movement band/choral work premiered by the United States Air Force Band and Singing Sergeants and selected for broadcast nationally on a National Public Radio Special Project on Vocal Music in August 1997 *Sinfonia Voci for band and choir *Symphonic Movement, commissioned by the Missouri Bandmasters Association for the 25th Anniversary of the Missouri All-State Band in 2001. *Texas Promenade, celebrating the 50th Anniversary Convention of the Texas Bandmasters Association *To Tame the Perilous Skies was commissioned by the 564th Tactical Air Command Band, United States Air Force, located in Virginia, and received its premiere performance in the fall of 1990. Although it leaves the storyline completely to the listener's imagination, \\"Perilous Skies\\" was conceived as a programmatic work literally depicting two opposing forces colliding in battle. The elongated canonic introduction presents a six-pitch intervallic display that is used throughout the composition, both as an intact melodic statement and a fragmented germative device, to depict every extra- musical element from serenity to air war to triumphal deliverance. Little did Holsinger realize the prophetic nature of the work, when at the time of its premiere the United Nations forces were assembling in the Persian Gulf; it was only a few months later that the world watched as modern technological air power \\"tamed the perilous skies\\" over Iraq and Kuwait. Then, in retrospect, this work is dedicated not only to the exceptional men and women of the Tactical Air Command, but to the spirit of the modern military aviator, taming the perilous skies that all men might live free of tyranny and oppression. *The War Trilogy: 1971, a special edition of the Kent State University contest winner *‚ÄùZinphonia‚Äù, premiered by the Virginia Wind Symphony at the 2017 Midwest Clinic in honor of Dennis Zeisler.

As a burgraviate, it was a county seated in the town of Nuremberg; almost two centuries passed before the burgraviate lost power over the city, which became independent from 1219. Eventually, the burgraviate was partitioned to form Brandenburg-Ansbach and Brandenburg-Bayreuth.  History  Nuremberg was probably founded around the turn of the 11th century, according to the first documentary mention of the city in 1050, as the location of an Imperial castle between the East Franks and the Bavarian March of the Nordgau. N√ºrnberg, Reichsstadt: Politische und soziale Entwicklung (Political and Social Development of the Imperial City of Nuremberg), Historisches Lexikon Bayerns From 1050 to 1571, the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade routes. King Conrad III established the burgraviate and the first administration and courts over the surrounding Imperial territories. The first burgraves were from the Austrian House of Raabs but, with the extinction of their male line around 1190, the burgraviate was inherited by the last count's son-in-law, of the House of Hohenzollern. From the late 12th century to the Interregnum (1254‚Äì73), however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Staufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor () from 1173/74. This castellan not only administered the imperial lands surrounding Nuremberg, but levied taxes and constituted the highest judicial court in matters relating to poaching and forestry; he also was the appointed protector of the various ecclesiastical establishments, churches and monasteries, even of the Bishopric of Bamberg. The privileges of this castellanship were transferred to the city during the late-14th and early-15th centuries. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellan finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city. Nuremberg is often referred to as having been the 'unofficial capital' of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly because Imperial Diets (Reichstage) and courts met at Nuremberg Castle. The Diets of Nuremberg were an important part of the administrative structure of the empire. The increasing demand of the royal court and the increasing importance of the city attracted increased trade and commerce to Nuremberg, supported by the Hohenstaufen emperors. Frederick II (reigned 1212‚Äì50) granted the ' () in 1219, including town rights, Imperial immediacy (Reichsfreiheit), the privilege to mint coins and an independent customs policy, almost wholly removing the city from the purview of the burgraves. Nuremberg soon became, with Augsburg, one of the two great trade centers on the route from Italy to Northern Europe.

Jagraon is more than three centuries old. It has been thought that the city's original name was Jagar aon, meaning \\"a place of great flooding\\", although this flooding has since ceased. It could also be argued that Jagraon actually derives from a source with a suffix \\"-graon\\" being a development of the Sanskrit Grama, meaning \\"village\\" as found in the Hindi word Gaon . Jagraon is at almost the geographical centre of Punjab state, from the River Satluj. It is from its district headquarters Ludhiana, from Moga, from Nakodar and 54 miles from barnala. History and religious significance Jagraon is an important religious centre for Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims as well as Jains. Jagraon was founded by Rai Kamaluddin father of Rai Kalha III of Raikot in 1680 AD. Gurdwara Nanaksar Sahib is one of the important places of worship for Sikhs. Gurdwara Mehdiana Sahib is known for its unique depiction of scenes from Sikh history, especially those of atrocities committed against Sikhs by various Mughal rulers, in the form of life-sized statues. There are also many famous Hindu temples including Bhadra Kali Mandi and Pracheen Shiv Mandir. Muslim places of worship include the famous khanqah and the mausoleum of Mohkam Din, where a three-day annual fair, Roshni da mela is held in the third week of February. Mohkam Din had two wives, one named Sara Bibi and the other Jeena Bibi. Sara Bibi is buried next to Mohkam Din and Jeena Bibi is buried about one half a miles away from Mohkam Din's Mazaar and is beautifully built. Thousands of people pay their respects to her when attending Hazrat Baba Mohkam Din's annual Urs Mubarik, which is known as Roshni da mela. Before 1947 CE there was a large Muslim presence in this area. Right next to the mazaar of Hazrat Baba Mohkam Din there is the maqbara of Syed Hameeray Shah Sahib who was the adopted son of Mohkam Din because he had no child from either wife. Syed Hameeray Shah Sahib was also his great khalifa, matabanna and mutawalli of the property related to Mohkam Din. Mohkam Din died in February 1913 CE. He was initiated by his saint Murshid Muhammad Amin Sahib Sirhindi who was a saint and wali of the Naqshbandi Order established in India by Ahmad Sirhindi Mujaddid Alif Thani. Maulvi Mazhar Hassan Wakeel was the sajjada nishin and mutawalli of the Mazar Sharif. In 1947 he migrated to Pakistan. Gurudwara Nanaksar, a gurdwara built as a memorial for the saint, Nand Singh The Jain temple in Jagraon is considered as one of the most holy places for Jains in the region. Earlier the temple had quite a peaceful ambiance and a good garden. However presently its proximity to the bus stand, police station and the bazaar has made it quite a congested place full of the noise of urban life. Nevertheless, it attracts thousands of pilgrims from the Jain community all over the world, for the annual Diksha Mahotsav in the third week of March. The old walled city, with its four gates is known locally for its Mughal period architecture. Even the local market within the walled city is known as Anarkali bazaar, after the title of a beauty at Mughal Emperor Akbar's court. This bazaar is very congested. Despite all the congestion stray cows can be found in the narrow lanes bringing the traffic to a halt. Jagraon is also the home of Lala Lajpat Rai, a well-known figure in the Indian Independence movement, who greatly influenced Bhagat Singh. His house is now a municipal library. The chiefs of Jagraon according to Major Charles Francis Massy's 'Chiefs and Families of Note in the Punjab' were Chandravanshi Rajputs, the last being Rai Inayat Khan, the custodian of Guru Sahib's Ganga Sagar at the time of the Partition of India in 1947. Rai Aziz Ullah Khan ex-MP (MNA) in Pakistan is the grandson of Rai Inayat Khan.\\"Major Charles Francis Massy, Chiefs and Families of Note in the Punjab, 1890, 1909 and 1940.Ludhiana Dist.

This magnificent soldier braved the 10,000 Afghans with his team of 21 sikh sepoys. Akshay Kumar's movie \\"Kesari\\", an inspirational movie on the courage and sacrifice of Havildar Ishar Singh and his team of 21 sikhs reminds us of this forgotten historical event and sacrifices made by these brilliant soldiers at the cost of whose lives we enjoy the present day freedom. Geography and connectivity Jagraon is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Jagraon It has an average elevation of . Jagraon is rather hot in the summers and cold in the winters. The smog owing to the burning of paddy straw after harvesting spoils the charm of the autumn season which is otherwise balmy. For this reason, the NRI population of the area visits it mainly during winters. For the same reasons marriages are solemnised in the cold weather. The geographical center of the present-day Indian state of Punjab lies only around 8 miles north of the city. The tehsil of Jagraon is bound to the north by River Satluj, which separates it from District Jalandhar. To the west lies Moga district. Raikot lies to the south and Ludhiana city is east. Jagraon is well connected by Rail and road to Ludhiana, Firozpur and rest of the country. It is located at the junction of National Highways No. 95 and 71. The nearest domestic and defence airports are: Halwara (), Sahnewal () and Adampur (). The nearest international ports are Guru Ram Das International Airport, Rajasansi (), Wagah Landport (Border with Pakistan) () and Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi (). The construction of a four lane expressway on the National Highway 95 which connects the city to major cities like Ludhiana (), Chandigarh () in the east and Moga, Ferozepur in the west is stuck up now. It includes bypass flyovers over the cities falling on this stretch. This project was meant to give a boom to the real estate of the city as it is one of the nearest city to the Ludhiana Metro. This project which was intended to be completed by 2014 to reduce the 45 mins drive from Ludhiana to Jagraon to approximately 15-20 Mins is unfortunately in a state of Limbo at present. Several accidents occur due to the diversions caused by the construction work that is suspended since several months. Demographics As of 2001 India census, Jagraon had a population of 60, 106. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Jagraon has an average literacy rate of 68%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 71%, and female literacy is 65%. In Jagraon, 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. Besides this, the city has a large seasonal and migrant population which remains unaccounted.

The city has a good mix of people from many faiths, including Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Buddhists, s etc. Before the Partition of India in 1947, the city was home to a sizeable Muslim population. Legislative, executive and judicial set-up The city is a sub-division of the Ludhiana District which has five sub-divisions including the Jagraon. It is represented in the State legislative Assembly by the elected Member of Legislative assembly as a constituency No.71 and the current MLA is Mrs. Saravjit Kaur Manuke (AAP) Further the city is divided into a local body known as Municipal Council which constitutes 16 wards division and the elected councillors of the wards elect and appoint the President of the council. Mr Raj Kumar Malhotra and Baldev Dhir are former presidents of council. The areas falling out of the Municipal limits are politically administered by the Panchayats and there are roughly 80 villages under its jurisdiction. The executive structure is headed by the District Commissioner at the district level and pyramids to Sub-Divisional Magistrate as the highest officer of administration at the Sub-division level and further declines to Executive officer at Municipal Council, Tehsildars and patwaris at revenue department to Block Development Officers at the village level. The police chief of the city is ranked as the SSP(Senior Superintendent of Police) to Deputy Superintendents, Station House Officers, Assistant Sub Inspector, Constable and Home Guards.

Industry  The Jagraon is the third largest grain collection market of Asia after Khanna and Rajpura. The city's major industry, besides agriculture, is rice husking, with more than 100 rice shelling facilities. Jagraon hosts the second-largest animal market in Punjab, the largest being Vallah, near Amritsar. The proposed green field international airport project at Halwara was shelved owing to differences among the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Indian Air Force. In the recent times, the city has witnessed industrial units coming up in the area including the Mumbai-based corporate pharmaceutical company Wockhardt Limited, Ludhiana- based soap company Chhokra Soap, an edible oil refinery and a factory of the Adani Group adjoining to the city's jurisdiction. Due to industrialisation, closeness to largest metro of the state, agriculture and animal husbandry hub, centrally located in Punjab and good connectivity thou rail, road and air, the city is witnessing a boom in the real estate factor with sonic development in the residential and commercial area. However, in 2012 the city also witnessed the unauthorised residential colonies which were declared illegal by the state authorities. The Jagraon industry also includes clay brick factories, interlocking tile factories, agriculture tool manufacturers, cattle feed factories, gold and diamond ornaments manufacturing, commodities trading and electric equipment factories See also * Chakar * Ghalab * Ludhiana * Mullanpur Dakha * Sujapur village * S.

R., also credited by his initials STR or nickname Simbu, is an Indian film actor, director, writer, composer, dancer, lyricist and playback singer in the Tamil film industry. He began his career by playing roles as a child artist in films directed by his father T. Rajendar, before his first lead role in Kadhal Azhivathillai (2002), under his father's direction and produced by his mother Usha.  Early and personal life  Silambarasan was born in Thogarapalli Krishnagiri, Tamil Nadu, as the eldest child of T. Rajendar and Usha Rajendar. He has a younger brother Kuralarasan, and sister Ilakiya. He studied at the Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School. He Studied at Loyola College. Simbu entered the film industry from a young age and acted in many of his father's films until 2002, when he acted in Kadhal Azhivathillai, his first main role as a hero.  Film career  = 1984‚Äì2001 = Silambarasan made his acting debut Uravai Kaatha Kili.He further acted in his father's movies, including Thai Thangai Paasam, Oru Vasantha Geetham, En Thangai Kalyani, Enga Veetu Velan, Monisha En Monalisa, Oru Thayin Sabhatham, Samsara Sangeetham, Shanti Enathu Shanti, Pettredutha Pillai, Thiruvalla and Sabash Babu. In Samsara Sangeetham, Silambarasan danced to a song singing \\"I am a Little Star, Aaaven Naan Super Star\\". = 2002‚Äì2004 = Silambarasan played his first protagonist role in Kadhal Azhivathillai (2002), directed by his father. The movie had a successful run. His second film was Dum (2003), which was loosely based on Jagannadh's 2002 Kannada film Appu. It had mixed reviews but a good run at the theatres. His release, in 2003, Alai, which marked the first collaboration of Simbu and Trisha. This movie was eventually declared a flop by the critics. Silambarasan had three releases in 2004. The first was Kovil. This film, which deals with the relationship between a Hindu boy and a Christian girl, became a super hit, but Simbhu was praised due to his \\"restraint and matured\\" performance. It was a box office hit. After this, Silambarasan acted in a movie called Kuththu, a remake of the Telugu film Dil. It opened with mixed reviews, but had a successful run at the theatres. His final release in 2004 was Manmadhan. It was his first blockbuster hit movie. = 2005‚Äì2009 = In Thotti Jaya, Silambarasan played the role of an orphaned gangster who finds love. This movie was described by the critics as realistic. In 2006, he starred in Saravana, directed by K. S. Ravikumar. This was the second time that Simbu and Jyothika worked together after the success of Manmadhan (2004). He next starred in and directed Vallavan (2006), as well as writing its story, screenplay and co-dialogue. It was featured, prior to release, in \\"most awaited\\" lists from entertainment sites. The film got a grand release during Diwali, and was a box office hit. The song \\"Loosu penne\\" became a hit among the youths. In 2008, he starred in the action masala film Kaalai, which was a flop. Later that year, he appeared in another action masala film Silambattam. The film opened to mixed reviews but became a commercial success. = 2010‚Äì2015 = In 2010, his film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, directed and written by Gautham Menon, became a Tamil 'cult classic' film. Director K. Balachander in an open letter called Silambarasan's performance as his best in his career. The following year he appeared in two films. In early 2011, he appeared in the multi-starrer Vaanam (2011) as Cable Raja, a poor youngster. Malathi Rangarajan from The Hindu called it a significant film in his career. Later that year, his next release was Osthe (2011) in which Silambarasan played a police officer, had a decent box office run. After a year, Podaa Podi was released on 13 November 2012, and became a flop. After a sabbatical of three years, he acted in Vaalu, which was released on 14 August 2015 to mixed reviews. = 2016‚Äìpresent = In 2016, Idhu Namma Aalu became a super hit. The most expected project Achcham Yenbadhu Madamaiyada became an instant hit with much positive response. The background music by Oscar-winner A. R. Rahman adds to the intensity of the film and the songs are just the icing on the cake. Gautham said that Thalli Pogathey is the \\"best picturised song in a long time,\\" and is played at an unexpected moment in the film. In 2017, it was reported that Silambarasan had signed up for an English-language film. His film Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan was panned by critics and was commercially unsuccessful. It led to controversies that were reported in the media involving the film's producer Michael Rayappan blaming Silambarasan for being uncooperative during the film's production. In 2018, he appeared in Mani Ratnam's successful Chekka Chivantha Vaanam as part of an ensemble cast that included Arvind Swamy, Vijay Sethupathi and Arun Vijay. In 2019, STR acted in Vantha Rajavathaan Varuven. This movie created a lot of expectations for STR fans, because it was the first collaboration between him and Sundar.C. Unfortunately for STR fans, this movie turned out to be a flop at the box office.  Music  Silambarasan has frequently worked as a playback singer in the Tamil film industry. He first sang in Sonnal Thaan Kaadhala and went on to sing over 90 songs for various composers. He predominantly sings in his own films and has collaborated mostly with his friend and fellow composer Yuvan Shankar Raja. Silambarasan also wrote the lyrics for several songs of his films. On 27 December 2011, Silambarasan released the non-film single \\"Love Anthem For World Peace and Love\\" to promote world peace. In 2013, he sang Diamond Girl in Tollywood film Baadshah directed by Srinu Vaitla starring Jr. NTR and Kajal Aggarwal in lead roles.This marks his first venture in Telugu music. He stated in the summer of 2015 that he would collaborate with Yuvan Shankar Raja to release the non-film single titled \\"Karma\\". He Composed Music and Background score for the film Sakka Podu Podu Raja featuring Santhanam in the lead role.  Controversies  Silambarasan has been the subject of several controversies, primarily due to his outspoken nature. = Music = In 2010, Silambarasan sang and composed the song \\"Evan Di Unna Pethan\\" as a part of the soundtrack album for his film, Vaanam (2011) and the song faced severe opposition for its provocative lyrics. A women's rights organisation in Chennai criticised the lyrics and issued a statement to Silambarasan for the lyrics being \\"chauvinistic\\" that \\"demean women\\". Further it was argued that \\"music needs to appeal to larger sections than to the ‚Äòthrill-seeking‚Äô youth who are often misguided into ‚Äòcheap thrills‚Äô because of such songs\\", demanding censorship. However, several prominent people from the film industry came to support Silambarasan stating that there have been more objectionable scenes in films in the past and that there were \\"bigger issues in society\\" and applying censorship was not \\"the ideal way out in democracy.\\" After releasing a promotional version of \\"The Love Anthem\\" song in 2011, Silambarasan announced that a final version would be released thereafter and announced his desire to bring in international artists Akon and Rihanna for the venture. He subsequently headed to Los Angeles in January 2012 and recorded an original version of the song by himself at Studio Zappa with music producer Elan Morrison on the keyboards. The failure to sign in the international artists prompted the project's producer, Silambarasan's father T. Rajendar to lodge a police complaint against two agents who had misled his production company into supposed connections with the international artists concerned. Rajendar noted that the sound editor Ramji Soma and a Canadian entrepreneur Talvinder Bathh had charged Rs 12 million ($200,000) from his company and failed to return it despite promises made to sign on Akon, David Guetta and either Rihanna or Nicole Scherzinger for the project. In May 2013, Silambarasan was finally successfully able to bring in Akon to collaborate for an alternate version of the song, with the move being facilitated by Tracktical Entertainment. The latest version of the song is yet to be released, with Silambarasan hinting in early 2014 that the song may be launched before the end of 2014. In an interview in June 2015, he revealed that the venture would be resumed soon, though that he was busy with other commitments. In December 2015, a song, referred to by the media as the \\"Beep Song\\" was leaked online and was widely circulated. The song was initially reported to be written and sung by Silambarasan and composed by music director Anirudh Ravichander, and featured an expletive degrading women which had been beeped out. Subsequently, Anirudh denied any involvement in the song and Silambarasan clarified that he had written, composed and sung the song himself, stating he was unsure how the song was leaked and uploaded onto the internet. The song provoked widespread criticism from pressure groups and film personalities. Women activists organised protests in front of Silambarasan house in T. Nagar and other places. Meanwhile, the Left-wing of All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) alleged that the song was sexist and derogatory to women and filed a case against Silambarasan in Coimbatore. Based on the complaint, The Racecourse Police Station registered FIR against the actor and Anirudh. Likewise, the Cyber Crime Police in Egmore also registered a similar case against them. Silambarasan stated on his Twitter page that he will not hide anywhere and will face the course of law. However, he failed to appear in the Racecourse Police station on 19 December 2015 as per the summons sent to him. Fearing arrest, Silambarasan had moved the case to the Madras High Court for anticipatory bail. The Madras High Court consequently refused to issue an interim stay to arrest Silambarasan. In late February 2016, Silambarasan appeared before the Coimbatore City police in connection with the \\"Beep Song\\" case and claimed that he had composed the song long ago when he was depressed due to a love failure; he further stated that Anirudh had no role in it. = Relationship with directors = Silambarasan experienced difficulties with director A. J. Murugan during the making of his breakthrough film, Manmadhan (2004) and was widely reported by the media to have \\"ghost-directed\\" the project. Murugan later suggested that Silambarasan and his family then continually deprived him of royalties deriving from the film, such as the story credits, the Hindi remake rights and sequel rights.https://silverscreen.in/news/director-aj-murugan-says-manmadhan-script- was-his-not-simbus/ Murugan was later demoted and worked in Silambarasan's directorial venture, Vallavan (2006) as an associate director, and was consequently critical of the actor's insistence on interfering with the director's role. Another associate director of Silambarasan, G. T. Nandhu, also fell out with the actor during the making of Kettavan in 2007. The project was launched with Nandhu as the director but he later complained that Silambarasan actively encroached his role and subsequently left his name out of the film's promotional posters. Despite completing a schedule, the pair could not sort out their differences and the film was shelved. Soon after the failure of their collaboration in Kaalai (2008), director Tarun Gopi was critical of Silambarasan's involvement in the project and stated that the actor grossly interfered with his duties as a director. Gopi labelled the actor \\"unprofessional\\" and stated that he could not recognise the film from his original script. He later apologised for his remarks in late 2011. Cinematographer Madhi also had similar problems with the actor during the making of Silambattam (2008). In 2010, Linguswamy sacked Silambarasan from the production of Vettai (2012) after the actor suddenly began production on another film, Vaanam, without letting the director know. In reply, Silambarasan argued that Linguswamy had wasted hundred days of his time without telling him the script of Vettai and called the director \\"unprofessional\\". Silambarasan was later replaced in Vettai by Arya, while he chose to launch another new project titled Vettai Mannan immediately after his removal from Vettai and that movie was also shelved. During the making of Idhu Namma Aalu, the film's production delays meant that director Pandiraj and Silambarasan had difficulties. In July 2014, Silambarasan had changed his hairstyle in between schedule breaks, leaving Pandiraj unhappy. Silambarasan subsequently disclosed to the media that Idhu Namma Aalu was his production and that others should not question his involvement in the project. Pandiraj later also publicly clashed with Silambarasan's brother, the composer Kuralarasan, stating his annoyance at the delay in providing the film's music. He also defended actress Nayanthara against a complaint made by Silambarasan's father to be, producer T. Rajender, and stated the actress had wasted almost two years on the film due to the producers' poor organisation and was still yet to be paid for her work. He further stated that Silambarasan was insisting an extra \\"kuthu\\" number that the script did not warrant and that Rajender, Kuralarasan and Silambarasan were unnecessarily interested in making sure that the song was included against Pandiraj's wishes. Gautham Menon has also spoken out against the actor's lack of punctuality, revealing that the actor failed to turn up for a shoot abroad during the making of Achcham Enbadhu Madamaiyada, prompting a delay in the film's production. However he has also labelled Silambarasan as an \\"outstanding actor\\" and noted his high levels of comfort and trust in Silambarasan's ability. = Relationship with producers = Silambarasan's Anbanavan Asaradhavan Adangadhavan (2017) opened in June 2017 to negative reviews and became a box office failure. Several months after the release, the film's producer Michael Rayappan and director Adhik Ravichandran met the media to criticise the actor's unruly behaviour and interference during the course of the project. They alleged that during the first schedule, production was delayed by two months because several actresses refused to star opposite Silambarasan knowing his unprofessionalism and that later, the actor insisted that the team shift to a different town from the finalised town of Madurai, as he did not like the warm climate. After moving the shoot to Dindigul, he continued to refuse to shoot in public areas or on Sundays and regularly failed to turn up as per the agreed schedule. They alleged that during the first schedule, Silambarasan refused to film a song sequence, unfairly requested Shriya Saran to be replaced after she had finished her portions, demanded the shoot to be moved to London from Dubai and made false promises about reducing his body weight as required for the script. During the second schedule, it was alleged that he out-rightly refused to undergo makeup sessions, refused to turn up to shoot on time, demanded a hotel room on the East Coast Road, refused to provide hotel expenses and demanded that a production executive was sacked. Silambarasan also cancelled the third schedule and demanded that the film was released in two parts against the makers' wishes, while sending his team to Thailand to have leisure time on the producers' money. He later refused to coordinate when completing necessary scenes to make it a two-part film and also half-heartedly provided dubbing work. The producer revealed that out of an agreed schedule of seventy-six days, Silambarasan only worked on thirty-eight days, meaning that the dates of Tamannaah and Shriya Saran were widely wasted. As a result of the incident, Silambarasan was widely criticised by his peers in the Tamil film industry.http://www.thenewsminute.com/article/producers-council-serves-red- notice-actor-silambarasan-72077 In 2018, the Madras High Court ruled that Silambarasan had to pay back the money that he received as an advance from the producers at Passion Movie Makers. The ruling was in relation to the actor's failure to turn up for the shoot of a project titled Arasan, directed by Narayan Nagendra Rao, during the development of the film in 2015. Despite reluctance from the director to begin a civil suit, the producers filed a complaint and recovered the advance. In August 2019, producer Suresh Kamatchi announced that he had ousted Silambarasan from his film Maanaadu owing to the actor's failure to commit to dates properly. The film, which was directed by Venkat Prabhu, had undergone pre-production work for close to a year before Silambarasan's exit.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/maanaadu- not-dropped-str-will-be-replaced-with-another-actor-for-the- role/articleshow/70588026.cms Silambarasan later chose to launch another new project titled Maghaa Maanaadu immediately after his removal from Maanaadu.https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/after-being-dropped-maanadu- simbu-announces-mahaamaanaadu-107227 Along with Michael Rayappan and Suresh Kamatchi, several other producers came forward with an official complaint to the Tamil Film Producers Council about Silambarasan's poor punctuality during August 2019. Gnanavel Raja of Studio Green, Vijaya Raghavendra of All in All Pictures, and Madan of Escape Artists Motion Pictures were among those who were keen to get the body to compel the actor to return their advances. Gnanavel Raja had been making an untitled film with the actor directed by Narathar, while Raghavendra had paid the actor a deposit for Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa 2.https://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/040919/a-red-card- for-silambarasan-rajhendran.htmlhttps://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional- cinema/story/is-gnanavel-raja-s-mufti-dropped-because-simbu-didn-t-turn-up-on- sets-details-inside-1607433-2019-10-09 The actor's films have also languished in development hell since 2011, with the media widely labelling his interference as a reason behind the delays. Vignesh Shivan's Podaa Podi (2012) took four years to complete after production had started, while his next release Vaalu (2015) took three years. Another film, Nelson Dilipkumar's Vettai Mannan, began in November 2010 and was ultimately shelved, with the actor shooting for the film intermittently. Likewise Idhu Namma Aalu and Gautham Menon's Achcham Enbadhu Madamaiyada, began in 2013 and both were released in 2016 after publicised production delays. Silambarasan has also announced various directorial projects, which have failed to materialise, including Valiban in 2009, Manmadhan 2 in 2012 and an untitled English film in 2017. = Relationships with colleagues = Silambarasan has regularly had differences of opinions with fellow actors in the Tamil film industry. He has had a long-running rivalry with actor Dhanush, which has been widely reported in the media. Initial hostility between the pair began after certain punch dialogues from Silambarasan's Manmadhan (2004) had seemed to be directed at Dhanush, including a reference to his sudden rise to fame with Kadhal Kondein (2003) and his marriage to Aishwarya Dhanush, the daughter of leading actor Rajinikanth. When questioned about their rivalry in 2005, Silambarasan stated that the pair were not friends and that Dhanush failed to reciprocate his pleasantries at a wedding. Silambarasan continued to take shots at Dhanush through film dialogues in Kaalai (2008) and during the teaser trailer of Vaalu in 2012. Following the widespread acclaim of Dhanush's song, \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\" from 3 (2012), Silambarasan claimed that he began the trend of writing songs with simple lyrics and releasing single tracks for films, in reference to his \\"Evan Di Unna Pethan\\" from Vaanam (2011). He subsequently also recorded, filmed and released a promotional video to his \\"The Love Anthem\\" within a month of \\"Why This Kolaveri Di\\"'s release. The actor's actions and song were criticised by the media during the period, who felt he purely just wanted to compete with Dhanush. In 2012, the pair reconciled and sorted their difference during an awards ceremony held in Dubai, and later celebrated Dhanush's birthday together. Dhanush dismissed reports that the pair were rivals and stated that misunderstandings had grown as a result of their lack of interaction. Dhanush later offered Silambarasan the opportunity to feature in a cameo role in his production, Kaaka Muttai (2015). Silambarasan had a dispute with veteran comedian Goundamani following the release of Manmadhan (2004), with the comedian feeling that the actor had edited out too many of his scenes. In reply, Silambarasan noted that the cuts were necessary for the pace of the film, while adding that Goundamani as a senior actor, should have known better. During the making of Vallavan (2006), actress Reemma Sen threatened legal action against Silambarasan after he made changes to the scope of her role in the film. She later stated she regretted her claim and was proud to have won critical acclaim for the character. Actress Lekha Washington was also critical of her experience working with Silambarasan on the shelved film Kettavan, and noted that she faced harassment on the sets.https://www.indiatoday.in/movies/regional-cinema/story/did-lekha- washington-hint-that-simbu-sexually-harassed-her-1373467-2018-10-23 In 2007, Silambarasan had a televised spat with actor Babloo Prithiveeraj during the filming of the dance show Jodi Number One, in which Silambarasan appeared as a judge. The actor argued with Prithveeraj regarding his dancing ability and later stormed out of the sets in tears, before being brought back by the other judges. In early 2011, Silambarasan and actor Jiiva briefly displayed public enmity after Silambarasan had talked down the success of Jiiva's Ko (2011). Silambarasan had walked out of the production of Ko after a photoshoot in early 2010 over creative differences with director K. V. Anand, particularly on the issue of the casting of Karthika Nair as the lead actress. Jiiva publicly called Silambarasan a \\"back stabber\\", though soon both actors decided to stop their respective public name calling. Following the release of Vaanam (2011), actor Bharath expressed his disappointment at being largely left out of the film's promotions and alleged that Silambarasan had asked the producers to reduce publicity for the film's other actors. Bharath called the incident a \\"sad phase in his career\\" and stated he was unsure if he would work with Silambarasan again. In return, Silambarasan denied any involvement in the film's promotional strategy and hinted that the film's success was largely dependent on his star image. During the campaigning process for the 2015 Nadigar Sangam elections, Silambarasan launched a scathing personal attack on actor Vishal during a press conference. Silambarasan had run for the position of Vice-President as a part of Sarathkumar's team, and in a bid to denounce Vishal's credibility for the opposing party, the actor alleged that Vishal had a personal vendetta against Sarathkumar. He further added that Vishal was behaving like a \\"fox\\" and ridiculed Vishal's stature to be a part of the election. Silambarasan's actions were widely criticised, with Vishal subsequently thanking the actor for tilting public opinion further towards his team. Subsequently, Sarathkumar's team and Silambarasan unanimously lost in the election process.

Blown Away is a 1993 erotic thriller film directed by Brenton Spencer and starring Corey Haim, Nicole Eggert, and Corey Feldman. It is a direct-to-video film.Direct to Video Connoisseur: Blown Away (1993) Direct to Video Connoiseur  Plot  After her mother dies in a mysterious car accident, 17-year-old Megan (Nicole Eggert), daughter of a wealthy businessman, lives a reckless lifestyle. A year later, she is almost killed by a horse who has lost control, though she is rescued by Rich (Corey Haim), a young college dropout who works at the ski resort owned by her father Cy (Jean LeClerc). Grateful, she invites him to her party, where she thanks him again by being intimate with him in her father's bed. The next morning, Cy comes home and almost catches them. Even though he does not, he angers Megan by forbidding her to see any guys. Unlike Cy, Rich's girlfriend Darla (Kathleen Robertson) does find out about the affair, and dumps him. Rich wastes no time and enters into a passionate relationship with Megan. She soon introduces him to her father, but he disapproves of him, and Megan tells Rich that they cannot see each other any longer. Devastated, Rich turns to his womanizing older brother Wes (Corey Feldman) for comfort, who encourages him to do everything to get Megan back. He follows her to a bar, where she is seen giving a large sum of money to a criminal-looking man. Rich catches her getting intimate with the guy, and knocks him down as a response. Megan then apologizes to Rich, and claims that she did not think that he really loved her and was only testing him in order to see how much he would be willing to do for her. He immediately takes her back, and they accompany each other to a bar, where Wes always hangs out with his friends. While Rich is arguing with Darla, who accuses him of going out with her only because of her money, Megan is seen talking with Wes. As they go to their home together, they run into Cy, who calls his daughter a slut for bringing a boy home, resulting in a huge fight between them. Rich decides to go home, where he finds Wes sleeping with Darla. Enraged, he tries to beat up Wes, but Darla stops them by informing Rich that he does not own her; later, Rich apologizes to Wes, saying that he should not have taken his feelings of anger out on him, and Wes accepts (while remarking that it had been a while since they \\"had a few rounds\\" with each other), and then apologizes for what he did. Rich decides to return to Megan's place, where she ‚Äî fed up with fighting with her father ‚Äî convinces him that her father killed her mother and that they should kill him, and run off with the money. However, Rich, blinded by the potently sexual relationship, is in two minds about what to do. The next day, Rich and Wes are shocked to find out that Darla has been killed in a horse riding accident. Meanwhile, Megan turns out hospitalized and claims to Rich that her father is to blame. Rich, seeing how severely beaten up she is, fears losing her someday to Cy's abuse, and promises her to help her. As they return home, Megan tells Rich that she has placed a bomb in his bike, and that 'it will all be over soon'. The next morning, Rich is invited by Cy to accompany him on a bike ride, causing Rich to witness the explosion that throws him almost off a cliff. As Cy falls to his death, he tells Rich that he did not kill his wife. Rich starts to suspect that Megan may not be who he thinks she is, and meanwhile, he becomes the prime suspect in Cy's death in the investigation of Detective Anderson (Gary Farmer). Despite Anderson's attempts to make him turn in Megan, Rich denies any involvement in the entire ordeal, though evidence points against him. Wes is shocked that his brother would have killed anyone, and is mad at him for not having killed their own abusive father. Shortly later, Megan bails out Rich, and gives him her car to skip town with. She promises him that she will follow him soon after collecting her father's money. Rich drives off. However, now distrustful of Megan, he checks the car and finds a bomb in it. He is able to get away just in time for the explosion and immediately rushes to her house. There, it is revealed that Megan and Wes were lovers all along and planned the murders and schemes together in order to be together. Rich confronts his older brother, and Wes informs him that he tried to frame him because he has always hated him. As Wes is about to shoot Rich, Megan kills Wes. She tries to put the entire blame on Wes, but Rich does not believe her, prompting her to reveal that she was the mastermind behind it all. As she tries to shoot Rich, the police arrive, killing Megan immediately in self- defense; Rich was wired throughout the final scene, which clears him from all charges (although he has nobody important in his life anymore, leaving him empty inside).

It is located in Vhembe District, Limpopo. It is named for the salt pan (, or \\"place of salt\\")Located at located at its western end. The mountain range reaches the opposite extremityLocated at in the Matikwa Nature Reserve, some due east. The range as a whole had no Venda name, as it was instead known by its sub- ranges which include Dzanani, Songozwi and others. Of late it is however known as Tha vhani ya muno, meaning \\"mountain of salt\\". The Soutpansberg forms part of the 'Vhembe Biosphere Reserve', which was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO in 2009. The latter reserve also includes the Blouberg Range, Kruger National Park, Makgabeng Plateau, Makuleke Wetlands and the Mapungubwe Cultural Landscape.UNESCO - Biosphere Reserve Information Geography The mountain is intersected by two defiles, the Waterpoort in the west, containing the Sand River (Polokwane) and a railway line, and Wyllie's Poort, which allows N1 road traffic to pass from Louis Trichardt to Musina. Lajuma is the highest peak at . The Nzhelele River and its tributary the Mutamba, the Nwanedi River and its tributary the Luphephe River, as well as the Levubu River and its main tributaries, the Mutshindudi and Mutale Rivers, and the Letaba River rise in the slopes of the Soutpansberg Mountains. The Brak River, a tributary of the Sand River, flows diagonally at the western end of the Soutpansberg, separating it from the Blouberg further west.The Soutpansberg History =First Europeans= The first white person to reach, and name, the mountain was Coenraad de Buys, a colonist who fled from Graaff Reinet after a failed rebellion in 1795. He settled near the mountain in 1820 and was the patriarch of a half-caste clan, the \\"Buysvolk\\" or Buys People, who are still to be found at Buysdorp. De Buys was followed by voortrekker Louis Tregardt who sojourned at the salt pan from May to August 1836. In November 1836 Tregardt moved camp to the vicinity of the later Schoemansdal and Louis Trichardt town, where he stayed until June 1837. From June to August 1837 Tregardt's party camped at the Doorn River, on the current Doorn River farm, whereafter they departed for good to find a trading route to the sea. =Early settlement= Hanglip promontory, overlooking Louis Trichardt Eleven years later, in 1848, a settlement named Zoutpansbergdorp was established at the site of an earlier Tregardt camp. It was founded by Jan Valentyn Botha, who led a faction of Andries Potgieter's trek. Potgieter died at Zoutpansbergdorp in 1852, and his son shortly afterwards. In 1855 the town's de facto leader was Stephanus Schoeman who named the growing, though disorderly reed-hut settlement Schoemansdal, after himself. Augmented by renegades, the town was a successful ivory trading centre by 1855, when its population numbered 200. Venda hunters supplied the Voortrekkers with ivory, and were in return supplied with fire arms. Relations between the Voortrekkers and Venda soured due to taxation, cattle rustling and lax control over the supply of fire arms. Total discord broke out in 1866, when the voortrekkers intervened in a Venda succession dispute, and one claimant, Makhado, attacked an outlying voortrekker settlement. Despite the arrival of a relief commando, the Venda's mountain strongholds could not be taken. The voortrekkers abandoned the town on 15 July 1867 and established Pietersburg. An open-air museum was established to recreate the modest settlement. =First town= In October 1898 the Boere returned to regain control over the territory. General Piet Joubert's commando occupied a strategic position over the Doorn River in preparation. In November, Mphefu's kraal suffered a three-pronged attack and his royal village was torched. Mphefu's clan fled across the Limpopo River to Zimbabwe. The farms Rietvlei and Bergvliet were set aside in 1898 for a new town, and Trichardtsdorp was proclaimed the next year, named in honour of Louis Tregardt. Today the town commemorates his full name, Louis Trichardt. Ecology Composite image of landscape photographs from the Southern Soutpansberg. =Plant diversity= Approximately 2,500 to 3,000 vascular plant taxa, comprising 1,066 genera and 240 families are known to occur in the mountain. A species list from plots done at the Mutshidudi catchment area revealed 109 plant families, 397 genera and 619 species. 24 plant species are endemic to the mountain, and an additional 33 to the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve. 594 species of tree are native to the mountain or its direct vicinity. The Soutpansberg's immense floristic diversity can be attributed to several distinct floristic elements acting on it, namely Tropical, Mo√ßambique coastal, Lowveld, Afromontane, Bushveld, Waterberg, Kalahari and Limpopo Valley. Approximately 10% of Soutpansberg plants can be considered succulent, and 32% of the endemic flora can be regarded as succulents. Of the mountain's endemic flora, the Asclepiadaceae with 5 genera and 6 species displays a high generic diversity. Aloe presents the highest species diversity among native genera with 5 endemic species, and the monotypic Zoutpansbergia is the only endemic genus. The floral endemics include Encephalartos hirsutus, Duvalia procumbens, Euphorbia rowlandii, E. aeruginosa, E. zoutpansbergensis, Ceratotheca saxicola, Stapelia clavicorona, Tylophora coddii, Huernia nouhuysii, Aloe angelica, A. petrophila, A. soutpansbergensis, A. vossii, Combretum vendae, Blepharis spinipes, Mystacidium braybonae, Justicia montis-salinarum, Khadia borealis, Orbeanthus conjunctus, Streptocarpus parviflorus subsp. soutpansbergensis, Searsia magalismontana subsp. coddii, Vangueria soutpansbergensis and Pavetta tschikonderi. The tropical floristic element, which reaches its southern distribution within the Soutpansberg, accounts for the species Brackenridgea zanguebarica, Millettia stuhlmannii, Oxytenanthera abyssinica, Trilepisium madagascariense, Brachystegia utilis-torrei (assimilated into a dominant B. spiciformis genome) and Syzygium masukuense. These species are not associated with the central Zimbabwean Miombo floristic element, but rather with the Eastern Highlands floristic element, and particularly its foothills. =Reptile diversity= A total of at least 116 reptile species have been recorded in the Soutpansberg. This biodiversity is remarkably high for such a small area and makes up 36% of the total number of reptile species that have been recorded in South Africa. This is roughly the same number of species (119) that occur in the Kruger National Park. The diversity is high compared to biodiversity hotspots of the world and the species diversity per unit area is higher than that of most of these hotspots. The Soutpansberg rock lizard, Soutpansberg worm lizard, Soutpansberg dwarf gecko and the Soutpansberg flat lizard are all endemic and named after this range.I. G. Gaigher, Lajuma Research and Environmental Education Centre, http://www.soutpansberg.com/workshop/synthesis/reptiles.htm =Invertebrates= The Soutpansberg is known for a high level of endemism of its invertebrate fauna. =Conservation= Hikers in the central Soutpansberg In today‚Äôs world, natural areas are under a lot of pressure from human activity. Exploitation of natural resources, human encroachment due to expanding developments, poaching and general pollution ‚Äì these all affect the Soutpansberg in some way. At the moment the mountains are a World Heritage Site and they form part of the newly proclaimed Vhembe Biosphere reserve.http://vhembebiosphere.org/http://holocene- views.blogspot.com/2014_04_01_archive.html Gallery Organisms endemic to the Soutpansberg File:Searsia magalismontana subsp coddii, loof en vrugte, b, Walter Sisulu NBT.jpgSearsia magalismontana subsp. coddii File:Vhembelacerta rupicola.jpgSoutpansberg rock lizard, Vhembelacerta rupicola File:Platysaurus relictus1.JPGA male Soutpansberg flat lizard, Platysaurus relictus File:Soutpansberg Wormlizard (Chirindia langi subsp. occidentalis).JPGThe endemic Soutpansberg worm lizard, Chirindia langi subsp. occidentalis File:Lygodactylus ocellatus soutpansbergensis.jpgLygodactylus ocellatus soutpansbergensis, a gecko endemic to the Soutpansberg File:Hadogenes soutpansbergensis scbc.jpgHadogenes soutpansbergensis, a scorpion endemic to the Soutpansberg File:Opistophthalmus lawrencei soutpansberg.jpgOpistophthalmus lawrencei, a scorpion endemic to the Soutpansberg File:Soutpansberg Dung Beetle (Scarabaeus schulzeae).jpgSoutpansberg dung beetle, Scarabaeus schulzeae, a Soutpansberg endemic See also List of mountain ranges of South Africa * Nwanedi Provincial Park * Soutpansberg Conservancy Notes External links *The Soutpansberg *Soutpansberg Endemic Flora *Land of the Venda *Game & Nature Reserves in Soutpansberg, Limpopo Mountain ranges of Limpopo ","title":"Soutpansberg"},{"id":"3528734","text":"Jaguar is a computer software package used for ab initio quantum chemistry calculations for both gas and solution phases.

He served as the Member of Parliament for Vunjo constituency on multiple occasions until 2015 when he was defeated in the National election by Hon. James Mbatia of NCCR MAGEUZI. In early 2016 Mr. Mrema was appointed by President John Joseph Pombe Magufuli as the chairperson of Tanzania Parole Board. Mrema is a member of the Chaga tribe from Kiraracha Village near Mount Kilimanjaro. He is the second of five siblings. Education From 1955 until 1963, Mrema attended primary and secondary education at Moshi, thereafter joining St.Patrick Teachers training college also in Moshi where he finished his Secondary education in 1965. In 1968 Mrema sat for the Cambridge University O-level exams. He joined the Kivukoni Political Education College, after which he was sent to Marangu for further training. Government positions Mrema has been in the Tanzania Government, National Security Organisation and the CCM party since 1966; he has held the following 5 positions as follows: # Rural Civics Teacher 1974-1980 # Teacher at the National Security College 1980-1982 # Assistant Deputy for National Security in the Dodoma Region 1982-1984 # Chief Deputy for National Security in Dodoma Region 1983-1984 # Chief Deputy for National Security in Shinyanga Region 1985-1987 Political career Even though Mrema has contested every presidential election in Tanzania since the country instituted a multiparty system in the early 1990s, his political career started in 1985 when he tried to run for MP in his home district of Kilimanjaro. His candidacy was blocked by the High Court, and in 1987 he was officially announced as the winner after a lengthy appeals process. He was able to retain his seat in 1990 without stiff competition. The fact that he was an MP enabled the president to appoint him to various cabinet positions. From 1990 to 1995 Mrema held various cabinet and high level government positions: * Minister of Interior 1990-1994 * Minister of Labour, Development and Sports 1994-1995 Mrema left CCM in 1995 and joined a new political party National Convention for Construction and Reform-Mageuzi.

Early years Born in Kumamoto Prefecture, Mifune was married in 1908. It has been stated that she was deeply religious and, at times, was hypnotized by her brother-in-law. She allegedly developed her powers at the age of 24 by breathing and meditation exercises. Fukurai Tomokichi Fukurai Tomokichi Fukurai, Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of Tokyo, was deeply interested in the supernatural and desired to validate extra-sensory perception. Fukarai's supernatural interests were heavily criticized by his colleagues, but he was convinced Mifune's powers were genuine when he privately tested her in April 1910. A second, public test was conducted by Tokyo University president Baron Yamakawa Kenjir≈ç on 15 September 1910. She appeared to read messages written inside hidden envelopes, however, when these messages turned out to be not from Yamakawa but from Fukurai, she was widely seen as a charlatan and heavily criticized by the press. A modern researcher, Rodger Anderson has noted that the experiments were not properly controlled as Mifune \\"was often left alone with the test envelope, or insisted on turning her back to witnesses when attempting to psychically probe its contents.\\"Anderson, Rodger.

A few were identified and reburied by their families, but the rest were reinterred in a Hackensack cemetery. (The bodies were to be interred at Hoboken Cemetery, North Bergen, but when pits were dug for the bodies, human remains were found, in what was sold as virgin cemetery space. ) It is estimated that there are another 5,000 or so graves that have not been found, probably lying outside the Secaucus Junction projects construction areas. Some may lie underneath footings and embankments of the New Jersey Turnpike. The bodies were reburied at the Maple Grove Park Cemetery in Hackensack, New Jersey. The last body was removed from the cemetery on October 31, 2003. The remains of 4,572 were transferred. The Register of Burials listed interments between December 31, 1880, and April 12, 1962, but those within the removal area were from between 1920 and 1962.

It can be accessed through downloadable poker clients for the Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. It is the largest real money online poker site in the world, controlling over two-thirds of the total online poker market. A PokerStars.com online satellite tournament produced the 2003 World Series of Poker (WSOP) champion, Chris Moneymaker. As the first person to become a world champion by qualifying at an online poker site, Moneymaker's 2003 win was an important factor in catalyzing the poker boom of the mid-2000s. The press has called this the \\"Moneymaker effect.\\"PokerNews.com: The Moneymaker Effect: Five Years Later May 23, 2008 History PokerStars launched its beta play-money-only site on September 11, 2001. The company began offering real money wagering on December 12, 2001. PokerStars was originally a Costa Rican company, Rational Enterprises, which was majority owned by the Israeli Scheinberg family. The company was subsequently moved to Onchan, Isle of Man. The move was driven by the establishment of a 0% corporate tax rate and the removal of rules barring companies from accepting casino and poker bets from the United States of America. PokerStars holds its licence with the Isle of Man Gambling Supervision Commission and also holds numerous licences in other jurisdictions (see Regulated Markets below). On February 10, 2012, PokerStars acquired a European Union license granted by the Malta Lotteries and Gaming Commission. While privately owned, PokerStars had been the subject of financial media speculation regarding a possible initial public offering or merger with a publicly listed company. Analysts estimated its market value would have been approximately $2 billion (US) in 2006, which would have made the company one of the world's largest privately held gambling companies. PokerStars overtook PartyPoker as the world's largest online poker room after the U.S. Congress passed the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. Many sites, including PartyPoker, immediately suspended business with U.S. gamblers, while others, including PokerStars, did not. On December 27, 2009, PokerStars set the world record for the biggest online tournament. The tournament entry fee was $1, and the number of entrants reached 149,196. They broke that record on December 4, 2011, when 200,000 players played in a $1 buy-in tournament with a first prize of $50,000. PokerStars was so busy during the early stages of the tournament, all tournaments had to be stopped for 20 minutes because the heavy traffic crashed their servers. This record had been broken again at June 16, 2013, with 225,000 participants. The buy-in was $1 and went completely into the prize pool, with no rake. In January 2012, PokerStars introduced a downloadable mobile client for iOS from iTunes. In February 2012, the company also introduced a client for Android. On July 31, 2012, PokerStars bought its former competitor, Full Tilt Poker. The $731 million deal settled a civil lawsuit with the Department of Justice while giving ownership of Full Tilt Poker's assets to PokerStars. On June 12, 2014, The Stars Group, then known as Amaya Inc., agreed to buy PokerStars and its parent company for $4.9 billion in cash. The deal was completed on August 1, 2014.Wall Street Journal: Amaya Completes Acquisition of Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker As of April 6, 2016 they have reached an agreement with Netent to add desktop and mobile gambling games to its poker lobby in New Jersey and other locations. In February 2017, Microgaming announced a partnership with PokerStars, owned by parent company for the integration of its Quickfire platform. In July 2017, PokerStars agreed to a deal with bankruptcy administrators to acquire some of rival PKR.com's assets and in doing so will reimburse 60,000 PKR players 100% of their final balances. In December 2017, PokerStars unveiled a brand new player tournament called the PokerStars Players No Limit Hold'em Championship, which is to be held in January 2019. The tournament is expected to become one of the biggest events in the annual poker calendar with a twenty-five thousand dollar buy in and a $1 million bonus for the eventual winner. In March 2018, The Stars Group reached an agreement with gaming company Sugal & Damani to support the launch of its PokerStars brand in India.

PokerStars launched Zoom Poker in March 2012, with an official launch in May 2012. Zoom Poker is a fast fold ring game poker format where opponents change after every hand. The aim of Zoom poker is to offer players more hands of poker than in a regular ring game.

On July 31, 2012, the US government dismissed with prejudice all civil complaints against PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker after reaching a settlement with PokerStars which includes PokerStars purchasing Full Tilt. Under the terms of the settlement, PokerStars and Full Tilt Poker admitted no wrongdoing for their past U.S. activities. The U.S. Government acknowledged both companies can apply for licenses to operate online gaming in the U.S. when a legal framework for such licenses is offered. The settlement terms also called for PokerStars to acquire certain assets of Full Tilt Poker from the Government. On August 9, 2012, PokerStars paid $225 million to the U.S. Department of Justice, consummating the asset transfer of Full Tilt Poker. Full Tilt Poker was successfully relaunched on November 6, 2012.

He was regarded as a leader of the radical political faction within the Japanese military. Biography Born in Saga Prefecture in 1876, Masaki graduated from the 9th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1897 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the IJA 46th Infantry Regiment in June 1898. He was assigned to Tsushima Guard Battalion from May 1899 until November 1900, when he was promoted to lieutenant in the IJA 46th Infantry Regiment. He was sent to the front during the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, and served in Manchuria until December 1905. During this period, he was promoted to captain in June 1904; however, he found the war a highly traumatizing experience, and after his return to Japan, Masaki wrote that he had considered resigning from the Army and entering the Buddhist priesthood. Instead, Masaki entered the 19th class of the Army Staff College and graduated with honors at the top of his class in December 1905. An infantry officer, he was promoted to the rank of major in 1909 before being sent abroad as a military attach√© to Germany from 1911 to 1914. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in November 1914. After his return to Japan, Masaki was appointed as a staff officer in the Inspectorate General of Military Training where he served from 1916 to 1920, becoming a colonel in 1918. Appointed chief of Military Administration Bureau of the War Ministry in 1920, he was given command of the 1st Imperial Guards Regiment the following year. Upon his promotion to major general in 1922, Masaki served as a Brigade commander until becoming director of curriculum at the Japanese Army Academy, eventually becoming commandant by 1925. Promoted to lieutenant general in 1927, Masaki was placed in command of the IJA 8th Division and posted at Hirosaki, Aomori for two years before being transferred to IJA 1st Division in Tokyo until 1931. Serving as vice chief of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff, Masaki won promotion to full general in 1933 and appointed Inspector General of Military Education between 1934 and 1936. He retired from active military service in 1936.Ammenthorp, The Generals of World War II Masaki was active in the internal political factions within the Japanese Army. He was an early member of the radical Imperial Way Faction led by Sadao Araki. With Heisuke Yanagawa and Hideyoshi Obata, the group merged with the rival T≈çseiha faction under Kazushige Ugaki to dominate the Japanese army throughout the 1930s until World War II. A supporter of the Nazi Germany, Masaki continued his involvement with the Imperial Way Faction until his forced retirement though political maneuvers by General Tetsuzan Nagata. Dissatisfaction with Masaki's forced retirement resulted in the assassination of Nagata the following year which, in turn, led to the February 26 Incident of 1936. He returned to his native Saga Prefecture to serve on the Prefectural Board of Education in 1941.

The mountain is the third- highest in the Western Hemisphere, and is located about north of Aconcagua. Monte Pissis is named after Pedro Jos√© Amadeo Pissis, a French geologist who worked for the Chilean government. Due to its location in the Atacama Desert, the mountain has very dry conditions but there is an extensive glacier (with crevasses, which is unique in the region) Elevation A 1994 Argentine expedition claimed ‚Äîusing GPS technology available at the time‚Äî that the elevation of Monte Pissis was , higher than Ojos del Salado. Ten years later, with the use of higher precision systems, several other surveys proved that those measurements were inaccurate: in 2005, an Austrian team performed a DGPS survey of Pissis' summit and found the elevation to be . In 2006 an international expedition surveyed the height on the summit, and found results in agreement with an elevation around . This was later confirmed by a 2007 Chilean-Argentine-European expedition, which surveyed both Ojos del Salado and Monte Pissis and provisionally found the former to be and the latter .  Geology  Monte Pissis is a large andesitic-dacitic volcanic centre. It was formed between 6.6 and 6.2 million years ago. Like Cerro Bonete Chico it is one of the large volcanic complexes formed at that time over a deforming Nazca slab. Volcanism in the area ceased about 2 million years ago. Monte Pissis, Cerro Bonete Chico and Incapillo form a large volcanic complex that is among the highest in the world. Incapillo formed after Monte Pissis had ceased erupting, and hydrothermal activity at Incapillo may continue to this day.  Climbing  Until recently, this mountain had received very little attention. The first successful recorded ascent was achieved in 1937 by Polish climbers Osiecki and Szczepanski. The mountain was not climbed again until 1985. The opening of mining in the area has resulted in the construction of basic roads in the last 15 years. This has developed the tourism in the Atacama Desert and now more people ascend the mountain, usually with a previous stop in Fiambal√° to organise the climb. Approaching it from neighbouring Chile is also possible but involves a longer way. As the mountain is very high and remote, a long approach is required but the ascent is easy and does not require any specific climbing skill. Nevertheless, warm clothing and good shoes are required as temperature during the night can drop as low as and winds can be very strong. Usually most teams ascend the peak during December to March, the warmest period of the year. Main glacier on Monte Pissis.

He was the founder of Nawab, a local newspaper, and was a popular litigant who, through his prolific use of public interest litigation, helped bring many cases into public notice for nearly three decades, including a number of cases against late K. Karunakaran, former Union Minister of Commerce and Industries and Chief Minister of Kerala. Nawab Rajendran: Oru Manushyavakasa Porattathinte Charithram, a biography by Kamalram Sajeev, details Rajendran's social activism.  Biography  T. A. Rajendran was born in 1950 to Kunjirama Poduval and Bhargaviamma at Payyanur, in Kannur district in the South Indian state of Kerala. He started his career as a journalist by founding a local daily, under the title, Nawab and started publishing anti-corruption stories regularly which earned him enemies due to which he suffered several assaults and was remanded on many occasions. Soon, unable to stand against the opposition, he had to close down the daily permanently. However, the daily earned him the moniker Nawab Rajendran. Subsequently, he resorted to the use of public interest litigations to fight against corruption and social injustices and filed many cases against prominent personalities, starting with the infamous Thattil Estate Murder case against K. Karunakaran. He was involved in a number of cases against K. Karunakaran and his biography details the encounters, including allegations about how the political leader used the services of Jayaram Padikkal, then Deputy Inspector General of Kerala Police, took away documents supposedly incriminating K. Karunakaran. Rajendran, mostly seen in public wearing a knee-length kurtha and carrying a cotton shoulder bag, was diagnosed with cancer towards the later part of his life. On 10 October 2003, he was found unconscious in a lodge and was declared dead on arrival at the hospital. His body was cremated against his wish to donate his body to a medical college and the action of the authorities also generated public criticism. Rajandran once received an award for his social activism which carried a cash prize of of which he donated to the General Hospital, Ernakulam. The amount was used to form a charitable organization, The Manawa Seva Trust, and the organization collected additional funds to build a modern mortuary complex at the hospital. Vakkalathu Narayanankutty, a 2001 Malayalam film featuring Jayaram, was loosely based on Rajendran's life. His life has been documented by Kamalram Sajeev, in a biographical work, Nawab Rajendran: Oru Manushyavakasa Porattathinte Charithram, published in 2015.

It is one of the few Mel Brooks comedies that is not a parody, nor at any time does the film break the fourth wall. It co-stars Lesley Ann Warren, Howard Morris and Jeffrey Tambor. The original music score was composed by John Morris. The film was both a critical and a box-office flop. Plot Goddard Bolt (Mel Brooks) is the callous CEO of Bolt Enterprises. Bolt shows little regard for other people's needs, or for the environment. He has his eye on the slum of Los Angeles, with the intent of tearing it down. Bolt makes a bet with his biggest rival, Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor), who also has an interest in the property. Crasswell challenges Bolt to survive on the streets as if he were homeless for 30 days. Should Bolt lose, Crasswell owns the property, but should Bolt win, Crasswell will sell it for practically nothing. There are three conditions: (i) Bolt will be completely penniless; (ii) He must wear an electronic anklet that will activate if he leaves the boundaries, forfeiting the bet if he exceeds 30 seconds out of bounds; (iii) At no time can he reveal to any of the slum area residents that he is Goddard Bolt. To add to the look, Bolt has his mustache shaved off, then Crasswell confiscates his toupee and rips his jacket chest pocket. Bolt is taken to the slums, thrown out of the limo and begins the bet. Unbeknown to Bolt, Crasswell schemes to make Goddard's stay on the streets as bad as possible. Bolt, homeless, hungry and filthy, is befriended by skid-row inhabitants like Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Theodore Wilson) and given the nickname \\"Pepto\\" after falling asleep in a crate with a Pepto-Bismol logo on its side, having used the crate to urinate on mere moments before Sailor arrives. During the bet, he meets and eventually becomes attracted to Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on Broadway. During a scuffle with two muggers (including a chase through a Chinese kitchen/restaurant), Bolt is pushed out of bounds, which activates his anklet. To prevent the \\"30-second forfeiture\\", Bolt rushes back in, which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery, as it looks like he is tackling the muggers. The muggers are eventually defeated via a pot of boiling stock being poured over them from a height, forcing them to retreat their assault on Bolt. Bolt learns a series of important life lessons during his \\"adventure\\", namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success but rather the integrity of the human spirit. However, Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes that Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square, Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized (Bolt finds this out first hand as he forces his way into a party and his lawyers pretend that they don't know what's going on). Forced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake, a drugged Bolt murmurs that \\"life stinks\\". Molly implores him to remember small things such as the two of them waltzing that make life livable. Crasswell, meanwhile, has his own plans for the slum area, planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle during the televised ceremony. Crasswell attempts to stop Bolt with a hydraulic excavator. When Bolt's grapple has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket, the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell, in a court case, was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt, then reneged on the terms. Bolt, now in control of the area, has plans to renovate it into the \\"Bolt Center\\", which will give the slum residents employment, renovate the tenements into livable homes, and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying that Bolt has married Molly, and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event, only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple chapel in the slum area, then driving off in a limousine with a vanity plate \\"PEPTO\\".

Reception The film was screened out of competition at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. In a rare turn of events for a Mel Brooks film, it was both a critical and commercial failure. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 18% approval rating, based on 17 reviews with an average rating of 3.9/10. Praise did come from the fact that Brooks attempted a different type of satire rather than rehashing spoofs. The film underperformed at the box office grossing $4,102,526 domestically, under its $13 million budget. It has since gained a cult following for being an experimental film by Brooks, as opposed to his usual parodies. In addition, it received three stars from Roger Ebert.

To the west of the town are Broxbourne Woods, a national nature reserve. The Prime Meridian runs just east of Broxbourne.  History  The name is believed to derive from the Old English words brocc and burna meaning Badger stream.History of Broxbourne Broxbourne grew up on the Great Cambridge Road, now known as the A10. A number of old houses and inns dating from the 16th to the 19th century still line the High Street (now the A1170). The Hertfordshire Golf and Country Club is a 16th Century house with later alterations and additions. The New River The Manor of Broxbourne is described in the Domesday Book, which mentions Broxbourne Mill. The manor was held in the time of Edward the Confessor by Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, but had passed into Norman hands following the Conquest. King John granted the manor to the Knights Hospitallers until the Dissolution, when it passed to John Cock, after whose family Cock Lane is named. The parish church of St Augustine was entirely rebuilt in the 15th century, although a 12th-century Purbeck marble font survives. The interior has a number of monuments and brasses dating from the 15th to the 19th century. The three stage tower has a belfry with a peal of eight bells, three of which are dated 1615. Broxbourne station The New River which passes through the centre of the town, was constructed in the early 17th century. Broxbourne railway station was built in 1840. A terra cotta works was opened soon afterwards by James Pulham and Son, who specialised in creating artificial rock garden features; some of their work survives in the gardens at Sandringham House and Buckingham Palace. Pulham House was demolished in 1957. All that remained was one of the six brick kilns and the horse-drawn puddling wheel that ground the terracotta, which are now Grade II listed. The local council originally conserved these in 1986, and in 2016 full conservation was undertaken as part of a joint project between B3Living, Lowewood Museum and Broxbourne Borough Council, with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The area was exploited for its gravel and sand extraction in the twentieth century leaving numerous water-filled lakes. Several of the lakes form part of the Lee Valley Regional Park.  Local government  St Augustine, Broxbourne with the New River in foreground Broxbourne was a civil parish in the Ware Rural District from 1894 to 1935. In the latter year the more heavily populated eastern end of the parish was added to the Hoddesdon Urban District, while the rural western portion remained in Ware Rural District, forming part of the civil parish of Brickendon Liberty. The former area of Hoddesdon Urban District merged with that of Cheshunt Urban District to form the Borough of Broxbourne in 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. The local Member of Parliament is Charles Walker MP, who is from the Conservative party. Broxbourne now forms one of thirteen wards of the borough, returning three councillors.Councillors (Borough of Broxbourne Online), accessed September 24, 2007 Sport and leisure Broxbourne has a Non-League football club, F.C.

He was a member of Mali's Association for Unity and the Progress of Islam (AMUPI), Director of Mali's first Islamic radio La Voix du Coran et du Hadith and a member of Mali's National Independent Electoral Commission (CENI) as representative of religious associations. Prior to that civil society career, he was very much involved with soccer, having been referee, founder and first President of the Ligue R√©gionale de Football de S√©gou, and founding member and Vice-Chair of Referee Commission of Malian Football Federation. He was commonly called \\"Ba Garan\\" (Bambara term for father Garan). Early life Garan Fabou Kouyat√© is from a Griot or Djeli family (West African traditional story tellers, singers, and mediators). He is the son of Fabou and Fatoumata Kouyat√© and the cousin of labor organizer, communist and anti-imperialist militant Tiemoko Garan Kouyat√©. Garan Fabou Kouyat√© did his primary education in the 1930s in the city of Bamako in French Sudan and graduated in mid-1940s as a civil administrator. He served in Segou, Nioro, Bafoulab√©, Sikasso, and Bamako. Sport Kouyat√© was mostly renown in sport, especially soccer although his first hobby was bicycling and the Tour de France. He was a soccer referee, being the first official referee from French Sudan in the 1940s, and then a soccer administrator. As a member of the Association Sportive de Segou (ASS) and General secretary of Middle Sudan district (which includes Segou) from 1947 to 1959, Kouyat√© strongly promoted soccer in the Segou Region during the annual Coupe de l‚ÄôAOF (soccer competition between teams in French West Africa during the 1950s). Although no team from the region made it to the final, Kouyat√© was successful in making Segou a second major soccer center in the French Sudan after the capital Bamako. From 1950 to 1960, he served as one of three delegates of French Sudan in the Ligue de Football de l'AOF in Dakar. After the independence of Mali in 1960, Mr. Kouyat√© was the first President of the Ligue R√©gionale de Football de S√©gou and a founding member of the Malian Football Federation. Besides, he was the General secretary of the National Sports Committee of Mali, and led Mali's teams during the African Games of 1965 in Brazzaville, Congo as well as various friendship sport events in the Soviet Union, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, East Germany, and the People's Republic of China. Kouyat√© remained at the Malian Football Federation until 1974, where he was also Vice-Chair of the Referee Committee. He got into feuds with Ti√©coro Bagayoko, then prominent member of the ruling military junta in Mali and who was a notorious fan of Djoliba AC. Kouyat√© was briefly arrested and removed from all football positions. Ironically, following Ti√©coro Bagayoko's own arrest in 1978 (from internal conflict among junta members) and crisis within the Malian Football Federation (including Mali's being suspended by CAF for Ti√©coro's involvement in games), Kouyat√© was re-called to be President of the Provisional National Committee. Politics Kouyat√© had a brief political career from the 1950s to early 1960. His family house in Segou hosted several informal RDA meetings from its creation in 1946 to the late 1950s before independence, and he had since befriended with many political leaders, including Guinea's future President Ahmed S√©kou Tour√©. As a former student of Modibo Keita, he was very active in the promotion of US-RDA in Segou. He played an important role in US-RDA's 1957 decisive victory over Fily Dabo Sissoko's PSP. Later, there were some disagreements between him and the Segou's US-RDA representatives due to his \\"No\\" position in the 1958 French constitutional referendum in French West Africa. Further disagreements about the candidacies of delegates for party sections in Segou made him retired from politics. Later period After retiring for civil and sport activities, Mr. Kouyat√© joined the Malian Association for Unity and the Progress of Islam (AMUPI) in 1980. In 1994, he was appointed director of the radio station of AMUPI, La Voix du Coran et du Hadith, Mali's first islamic and religious radio station. In 1997, he was selected as representative of Mali's Muslim community to the National Independent Electoral Committee (CENI) and again in 2001 on behalf of all religious community. Kouyat√© was a very respected and well-known man in Mali. He served as honorary consultant for writers, historians, and biographers on Mali and West Africa's historical and cultural past. He was regularly called for advice in formal issues and in local mediation. He retired from formal activities in late-2000s due to his old age and health issues. He died on his bed on April 1, 2016, in his house in Bamako, Mali. He was buried, according to his wish, in his beloved hometown Segou, following an official funeral service by a unit of Mali's army based in Segou attended by three Government ministers and the Governor of Segou. Distinctions He received several sports-related awards, including M√©daill√© d'Argent de la Ligue de Football de l'AOF in 1955, M√©daill√© de Bronze de l'Education Physique et des Sports de la France d'Outre-Mer in 1957, Honorary Referee of the Malian Football Federation in 1967, and Dipl√¥me du Comit√© International Olympique in 2001. Additionally, he was awarded a Knight of the National Order of Mali in 1974, an Officer in 2002, and in 2009 he became Grand Officer of the Order.

Biography  Coat of arms of the Counts of Nassau from the Ottonian branch Siegen Castle Altenberg Abbey Otto was the third son of Count Henry II of Nassau and Matilda of Guelders and Zutphen,Cawley. the youngest daughter of Count Otto I of Guelders and Zutphen and Richardis of Bavaria (herself daughter of Otto I Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria). Otto is first mentioned in a charter from 1247. Otto succeeded his father before 1251, together with his brother Walram II.Becker (1983), p. 11.Huberty, et al. (1981). They received town privileges for Herborn from the German King William in 1251.Ausfeld (1887). Walram and Otto divided their county on 16 December 1255 with the river Lahn as border. The division treaty is nowadays known as the Prima divisio. The area north of the Lahn: the lordships Siegen,Before 1224, the counts of Nassau had transferred half of the city of Siegen to the Archdiocese of Cologne. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). Dillenburg, Herborn,In 1342, Henry I of Nassau-Siegen owned the total Herborner Mark. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). Tringenstein, Neukirch and Emmerichenhain, a part of the Kalenberger ZentThe Kalenberger Zent was an area located between the Oberlahn, the Dill and Wetzlar and included the areas Mengerskirchen, Nenderoth and Beilstein. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). (Amt Kalenberg), as well as Dietkirchen and (Bad) Ems, was assigned to Otto. Nassau Castle and dependencies (Dreiherrische),Castle and Amt Nassau bore the name Dreiherrische because until 1778 it was jointly owned by the Ottonian branch and two sub-branches of the Walramian branch (Nassau-Usingen and Nassau- Weilburg). See: Huberty, et al. (1981). the √Ñmter Miehlen and Sch√∂nau (Sch√∂nau Abbey near Str√ºth √ºber Nast√§tten)The √Ñmter of Miehlen and Sch√∂nau remained jointly owned until 1303, after which they were transferred to the Walramian branch and both sub-branches owned them jointly until 1778. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). as well as the Vierherrengericht,The Vierherrengericht was named after its four owners, the counts of Katzenelnbogen (Hessen), Diez (Nassau- Diez), Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg. In 1774 these areas, around the city of Nast√§tten and composed of thirty-eight villages, were divided. See: Huberty, et al. (1981). Laurenburg Castle, the Esterau (which was jointly owned with the counts of Diez) and the fiefs in Hesse remained jointly owned. Protecting and enforcing his rights in his country was not always easy for Otto, especially at a time when the power of the supreme patron in the empire had sunk deeply. Disputes with the lords of Westerburg and the counts of Sayn about prerogatives in the Westerwald, and with the lords of Greifenstein and the lords of Dernbach about executive powers, often led to feuds and struggles. The details of the course of these feuds are unknown. In his struggles with the Archbishop of Trier, Otto lost the Vogtei of Koblenz and of Ems. Otto's relationship with Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archbishop of Cologne, also remains unclear. Otto made a covenant with various lords in Westphalia on 8 April 1277 to wage war against the archbishop. But Otto was an ally of the archbishop in the War of the Limburg Succession. Otto's attempt to reduce his father's rich gifts to the Teutonic Order, or at least not to increase them in accordance with the wishes of the Order, ensured that he was designated as a robber of the goods of the order in 1285, was excommunicated, and his county was put under interdict, until the dispute was settled the following year. Otto founded the chapel in Feldbach before 1287.Becker (1983), p. 7.  ªOttho comes de Nassawen ‚Ä¶ cum uxore nostra Agnete nec non Henrico nostro primogenito º confirmed the donation of  ªbonorum in Hasilbach et Aldindorph º to the church in Aldenburg (read: Altenberg Abbey) made by  ªmatrem nostram Methildim comitissam bone mem ‚Ä¶ cum sorore nostra Katherina ibidem locata º by charter dated 3 May 1289.

According to Dek (1970), the eldest son from the marriage was born around 1270, so the marriage must have taken place before 1270. to Agnes of Leiningen (‚Ä† after December 1299), a daughter of Count Emich IV of Leiningen and Elisabeth.

The library is a dependency of the Colombian Ministry of Culture.  Founding and history  The National Library of Colombia is generally considered to be the oldest national library in the Americas. It was founded at the end of the eighteenth century in 1777 by Viceroy Manuel De Guirior, who established the library in the city of Bogot√°. The original collection of the library consisted of books expropriated from the Jesuit community, which had been expelled from all the dominions of the Spanish Empire, as a result of the 1767 order of King Charles III of Spain. In 1825, due to the work of Francisco de Paula Santander, the library was established at the campus of the Colegio de San Bartolom√© and received its current name. On March 25, 1834, the first legal deposit law was decreed, which required that all copies of printed material in the country be sent to the library for storage. This law set the objective of the library, which then became the sole entity in charge of maintaining the bibliographic heritage of the nation. Bibliographic wealth of Colombia (incunabular, prints, sound recordings and audio-visual work of great historical and artistic value), located in the southeast corner of Independence Park. Founded January 9, 1777, inaugurated in 1938 and remodeled in 1978 by architect Jacques Mosseri, except decorative elements and fa√ßade design remained the same.

In addition, according to a history of the library, the library also functions as a training center for librarians in Colombia as well as a source of books for other countries' libraries.  Functions  According to a decree of the Senate of Colombia, the library's stated functions are: *To advise the Ministry of Culture as it concerns the formulation of policies on the bibliographic and periodical national heritage *To guide the plans and programs about creation, promotion, and strengthening of public libraries and the complementary services that are rendered by them *To direct and coordinate the national network of public libraries. *To collect, organize, increase, conserve, preserve, protect, record, and spread the bibliographic and periodical heritage of the nation, sustained in different mediums of information. *To plan and design policies related to reading and its contribution to the development of the education and intellect of the Colombian people *To design, organize, and develop the bibliographic heritage to contribute to the strengthening of the national identity *To establish and maintain relations with national and international organizations, with the goal of promoting and developing programs of popular culture and cultural exchange together, in the themes related to books and reading *To provide advice to, and collaboration with, different scientific, cultural, and educational organizations that develop programs of investigation and cultural diffusion Law of legal deposit The National Library from above The law of legal deposit is regulated by Law 44 of 1993, the statutory Decree No. 460 of March 16, 1999, and the Decree 2150 of 1995. These laws and decrees are specifically about the National Library of Colombia. The creators of printed works, as well as audiovisual, audio, and video productions, should supply the library with a specified number of copies of the works, whether they were produced within the Colombian territory or imported. *For printed works, two copies of each of the works produced within the national territory should be delivered to the National Library of Colombia; one copy to the Biblioteca del Congreso de la Rep√∫blica de Colombia (Library of the Congress of the Republic of Colombia), and one copy to the Central Library of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (National University of Colombia), excepting a few cases in which the high cost of the edition or the short duration of publication makes it possible to deliver fewer copies. *For audiovisual and audio works, as well as for published works that have been imported, only one copy needs to be delivered to the National Library. Catalog Due to the legal deposit law and many charitable donations, the National Library has a large catalog of publications. The collection contains 47 incunabula, 610 volumes of manuscripts and other publications of \\"rare and curious\\" books, particularly purchased from or donated by personalities from the political and social life of Colombia, including the collections of Eduardo Santos, German Arciniegas, Jorge Isaacs, Manuel Anc√≠zar, Marco Fidel Su√°rez, Miguel Antonio Caro, and Rufino Jos√© Cuervo among others. The library also possesses publications of the United Nations Library, and pictorial works of historical value like the watercolors of the Chorography Commission.

It opened in 2005, thanks in a large part to a $26 million HUD redevelopment grant secured in 2000 by Congressman James A. Traficant, Jr. It is home to the Youngstown Phantoms of the United States Hockey League. The Covelli Centre was previously known as the Chevrolet Centre and is nicknamed \\"The Chevy Centre\\" or \\"The Convo\\" by some in the area from its former names. History The arena's grand opening was on October 29, 2005, when it hosted a concert by 3 Doors Down. The first hockey game was played about a week later, on November 4. In Fall 2007, the city hired Eric Ryan Productions of nearby Struthers, to temporarily operate the arena until the city could find another company to manage the facility. SMG and Global Spectrum are the final two companies in the running to run the Chevrolet Centre. The Chevy Centre was formerly managed by the International Coliseums Company, a subsidiary of Global Entertainment, which owns the Central Hockey League. On Friday, April 4, 2008; the city of Youngstown signed a deal with Ticketmaster to become the official ticket provider of the Chevrolet Centre. The arena itself is owned by the city. The arena, which was initially named the Convocation Center when it opened in October, was renamed a few weeks after its opening on Friday, November 18, 2005, when General Motors acquired the naming rights, and was renamed the Chevrolet Centre. Choosing Chevrolet for the naming rights was highly appropriate because one of the brand's more successful cars, the Cobalt, is manufactured in nearby Lordstown. On October 4, 2008, it was announced that GM had decided not to renew their naming rights deal with the city. The city was in the process of negotiating with local Chevy dealers to keep the name of the facility the same. On Wednesday, April 30, 2009 Covelli Enterprises (a local franchisee of Panera Bread and O'Charley's restaurants), signed a 3-year, $120,000 naming-rights deal, giving the Centre its current name (a complete signing switch is expected by June 1). Starting in November 2008, the Mahoning Valley Phantoms of the North American Hockey League played select home games at the arena. Upon joining the USHL, the Phantoms moved into the Covelli Centre full-time in 2009. TBA the Covelli Centre will be getting its first non minor league sports team. The Youngstown Nighthawks of the Major Arena Soccer League. They are currently part of the Premier Arena Soccer League. The Ohio Junior High wrestling championships were held at the arena. The facility is being utilized to house the \\"Mercy Health Covelli Field Hospital,\\" an additional medical space for COVID-19 patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Naming rights  On April 30, 2009, Sam Covelli, owner of many Panera and O'Charley's restaurants in the area, signed a 3-year, $360,000 contract to rename the then Chevrolet Centre to the Covelli Centre.http://www.vindy.com/news/2009/apr/30/covelli-name-to-be-center-of- attention-in-3-year/ Covelli has indicated that he plans to work to more aggressively market the arena. The arena officially took on the Covelli Centre name on June 1, 2009. Records The arena's first sold-out performances were on November 12, 2005, when it hosted two concerts by the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Both 2:30 and 7:30 shows were sold out. The first sold-out hockey game was on January 14, 2006. On March 8, 2010, it was announced that the Covelli Centre would host Elton John on May 1, 2010. The event sold out in a record time of 30 minutes on March 12, 2010, which eclipsed the previous record set by Carrie Underwood, an event that sold out in 48 hours. Revitalization The Covelli Centre has been at the forefront of what is hoped to be a major downtown revitalization in the city of Youngstown. The downtown economy has benefitted since its opening, primarily from guests patronizing its bars and restaurants before and after events. The main entrance to the Covelli Centre. The city and other private firms came to an agreement that allowed people to park for free in downtown on days when there is an event at the arena.

Career Goetschius was born in Paterson, New Jersey. He was also encouraged by Ureli Corelli Hill, a conductor and violinist, who was a friend of the Goetschius family.Thompson, David M.: A History of Harmonic Theory in the United States (Kent, Ohio: The Kent State University Press, 1980), p. 37. Goetschius was the organist of the Second Presbyterian Church from 1868‚Äì1870 and of the First Presbyterian from 1870‚Äì1873, and pianist of Mr. Benson's Paterson Choral Society. He went to Stuttgart, W√ºrttemberg (Germany), in 1873 to study theory in the Royal Conservatory with Immanuel Faisst, and soon advanced to become a professor. In 1885, King Karl Friedrich Alexander of W√ºrttemberg conferred upon him the title of royal professor. He composed much, and reviewed performances for the press. Syracuse University conferred an Honorary Music Doctorate on Goetschius for the academic year 1892‚Äì1893. In 1892, he took a position in the New England Conservatory, Boston, and four years later opened a studio in that city. In 1905, he went to the staff of the Institute of Musical Art (Juilliard School) in New York City, headed by Frank Damrosch. Goetschius's notable pupils include Henry Cowell, Lillian Fuchs, Howard Hanson, Swan Hennessy, Julia Klumpke, Wallingford Riegger, Bernard Rogers, and Arthur Shepherd. In 1917, he was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity's Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory. Selected music theory textbooks Goetschius published several textbooks on theory, including: * The Material Used in Musical Composition (New York: G. Schirmer) :: 1st ed. (1882); :: 2nd ed. (alternate link) (1889) :: 4th ed. (1895) :: 8th ed. (1907); :: 14th ed.

Presser, 1934) As of the mid-20th century, use of Goetschius' books, as texts, is rare; albeit, the books contain original theoretical ideas and pedagogical approaches that endure today. Goetschius' theory of harmonic progression Perhaps the most important theory put forth by Goetschius is that of natural harmonic progression, which first appeared in The Theory and Practice of Tone- Relations. According to Goetschius' theory, the triad V in a key resolves to the tonic triad I because of the acoustically perfect interval of the fifth between the root of V and that of I: center Goetschius believed that, since the upper tone of the fifth is a harmonic of the lower, a chord rooted on the upper tone demands to be \\"resolved\\" by progressing to the chord rooted on the lower tone. Moreover, this theory is extended to other chords in a key, so that the normal tendency of a chord (triad or seventh chord) in a key is to progress to the chord rooted a fifth lower. center The sole weakness of this theory is its failure to account for the importance of the subdominant triad IV, a chord frequently used in musical practice. Although Goetschius acknowledges the importance of the IV harmony elsewhere in his writings, it does not appear to have a place in his theory of harmonic progression. Family Goetschius died in Manchester, New Hampshire, where he had retired to in 1925.

One or both arms are used to encircle the opponent's arm under the armpit, and secured at the opponent's neck. Several different nelson holds exist, and they can be separated according to the positioning of the encircling arm(s). A nelson is used to control an opponent or to turn them over onto their back and execute a pin. The term \\"nelson\\" is derived from \\"full nelson\\", which dates back to the early 19th century. It has been suggested that it was named after Horatio Nelson, who used strategies based on surrounding the opponent to win the Battle of the Nile and the Battle of Trafalgar, but its true origin remains uncertain.Archer, Jeff; Svinth, Joseph (January 2005). Professional Wrestling: Where Sports and Theater Collide , InYo: Journal of Alternative Perspectives on the Martial Arts and Sciences. URL last accessed January 7, 2006. Variations A half nelson executed from the supine position =Quarter nelson= The quarter nelson involves putting one hand on the opponent's neck, passing the free arm under the arm of the opponent, and locking the free arm to the other arm by clasping the wrist. In amateur wrestling a strong quarter nelson can be used to secure a pin, or to control the opponent and advance into a more dominant position. =Half nelson= Half nelson. Power half nelson The half nelson is referred to by most coaches as being the easiest but most effective move in folkstyle wrestling, and is very commonly used. The half nelson is done using only one hand, by passing it under the arm of the opponent and locking the hand on the opponent's neck. In addition, the hand not being used should be holding the opponent's other wrist so that they cannot post the hand or peel the half nelson off. A power half nelson is a type of half nelson. The hand not performing the nelson is placed on the opponent's head to increase the overall power of the half nelson. When the half nelson has been put into place, it is used to turn the opponent over onto their back. This is accomplished by using the hand to press the opponent's neck down, while using the arm under the opponent's shoulder to lift the shoulder and drive it perpendicularly to the opponent's body. When the opponent has been turned over onto their back, the aggressor attempts to pin them by tightening the grip on the neck, putting the nelson in more deeply so that the aggressor's elbow is hooking the opponent's neck. Often the aggressor remains perpendicular to the opponent, chest on chest. The aggressor's free hand is used to minimize struggling by hooking the opponent's near or far leg or crotch. Countering the half nelson When the aggressor is in the process of putting the half nelson in, the opponent can attempt to prevent it from going in deeply by using their affected arm to clamp down on the intruding arm. This is especially effective if the opponent is on their knees instead of lying flat, which is why the half nelson should not be attempted until the opponent's stomach is on the ground. When the aggressor is driving forward perpendicularly to the opponent's body, the opponent can try to avoid being flipped over onto their back by extending their opposite foot in the direction of the undesired movement, and planting it. Once the opponent is on their back, they can attempt to avoid having their shoulders pinned to the mat, and to get off their back, by planting teir feet and pushing the mat with them, allowing them to roll their head back so the top of their head is on the mat, rather than the back of theirneck being on the aggressor's arm. From this position they can try to turn over, either toward or away from the aggressor. =Three-quarter nelson= The three- quarter nelson is done by performing a half nelson using one hand and passing the other hand underneath the opponent from the same side. The passing hand goes under the opponent's neck and around the far side to the top of the neck, where it is locked with the other hand around the neck at the wrist or using a palm-to-palm or interlacing fingers grip. The three-quarter nelson can be used in amateur wrestling to pin the opponent and is more secure than a half- nelson. =Full nelson= Full nelson The full nelson (sometimes called a double nelson or a double shoulder lock) is done by performing half nelsons with both arms. In collegiate, high school, middle school or junior high school, and most other forms of amateur wrestling, the move is illegal due to possibility of injury. The holder is on the back side of the opponent, and has their hands extended upwards under the opponents armpits, holding the neck with a palm-to-palm grip or with interlaced fingers. By cranking the hands forward, pressure can be applied to the neck of the opponent. The usage of the full nelson in combat sports is very limited. It is a secure hold which can be used to control the opponent, but does not allow for finishing action, such as pinning the opponent, executing a reliable submission hold, or allowing for effective striking.Benn, Frank.

(archived 2007-03-12) Because it can be used as a limited neck crank, it is considered dangerous in some grappling arts, and is banned, for instance, in amateur wrestling.

El Paso is mostly known for having the second largest coal mine in Colombia, located in the corregimiento of La Loma. Etymology El Paso means \\"The Path\\" in the Spanish language. The name was mentioned in a document establishing the encomienda with the Chimila indigenous peoples in the region. The documents mentioned \\"The path of the advanced\\" in reference to the path of Alfonso Luis de Lugo in 1544 from Cabo de la Vela in the Guajira Peninsula, Tamalameque in his way inland to the New Kingdom. Geography The municipality of El Paso is located on the central western region of the Department of Cesar bordering to the north with the municipalities of Valledupar and Bosconia; to the east with the municipalities of Los Robles La Paz, Codazzi, Becerril and La Jagua de Ibirico; to the south with the municipality of Chiriguana; southwest with the municipality of Astrea and to the west with the Department of Magdalena. History The region of El Paso was inhabited by the Chimilas. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas the region was a herd under the jurisdiction of the village of Becerril named the Hato of San Bartolome, established by Captain Bartolom√© de An√≠bal Pale√≥logo Becerra. Becerra's father, Vicencio de Anibal was also a conqueror and had received the capitulation for the land and Becerra had inherited his rights over the land as established in the document. On August 16, 1602 the Spanish established an Encomienda with the Chimilas in the area. El Paso was under the jurisdiction of Valledupar which was the main village in the region until Law 25 of June 1824 created the Canton of Valencia de Jesus which had segregated from the jurisdiction of Valledupar. On October 25, 1825 the Canton of Valencia de Jesus was suppressed and once again reestablished to Valledupar.

Fantasio is Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer, a graphic reporter with an uncontrolled imagination and a mop of blond hair. In his early incarnation, he was considerably taller than Spirou, with a clown-like demeanour, and his hairstyle resembled that of Blondie character Dagwood Bumstead.

Asian Pitvipers. Geitje Books. Berlin. 1st Edition. 368 pp. . is a venomous pitviper endemic to the Western Ghats. No subspecies are currently recognized. Geographic range Endemic to the Western Ghats, in Karnataka , Tamil nadu and Kerala states of South India, Trimeresurus strigatus is distributed in the montane forests and Shola grasslands of the Upper Nilgiri (Whitaker & Captain, 2004). Historically misidentified and misreported from extralimital localities from both the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats. Perhaps this is the species of pitviper confirmed from India to have the smallest geographic range of all. . The type locality listed is \\"Cape of Good Hope?\\" and \\"Madras?\\" (Madras Presidency (and not the City), India). The former must be a mistake. Boulenger (1896) restricted the type locality to \\"Madras Presidency\\". Inhabits to Sholagrasslands and montane forests. Terrestrial and probably diurnal. Feeds on frogs, lizards and mice. Natural history poorly-known. Description Trimeresurus strigatus may be distinguished from other pit vipers of peninsular India based on the presence of small internasals, 2nd supralabial in contact with loreal pit, 21 rows of smooth or weakly-keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and a single row of scales between labials and suboculars. The common name of the species is based on the presence of a pale buff horseshoe- shaped (i.e., inverted 'U') mark on the nape. The snake is pale brownish or buff coloured with darker blotches of grey and some white streaks. This species is essentially a terrestrial animal, with most of the sightings on ground or rock formations. Of 12 snakes measured, the mean snout-vent length (SVL) was 24.4 ¬± 7.04 cm (9.6 ¬± 2.8 in), the tail length (tL) was 3.5 ¬± 0.8 cm (1.4 ¬± 0.3 in), and the weight was 172 ¬± 10.5 g (6 ¬± 0.4 oz).

(1999). The Companion to Traditional Irish Music. New York University Press: New York, p. 152, 187-188 It is used primarily in Northern Ireland by Unionists and the Orange Order traditionally in street parades held in the summer, particularly on and around 12 July (\\"The Twelfth\\"). The weight of the drum means that it had been replaced with smaller replicas for most parades, but the full-sized instrument has started to reappear in recent years - usually on floats.Luton and Bedford drumming club appear in Belfast with full- sized LambegsBBC News (see picture 5 of 9 and the caption) It is also used by the Ancient Order of Hibernians, having historical significance for parts of the nationalist community, as well. Characteristics The Lambeg drum is, together with the bagpipe, one of the loudest acoustic instruments in the world, frequently reaching over 120 dB. It measures approximately in diameter and deep, and weighs . Usually it is carried by the drummer while marching, using a neck harness. Origin The origin of the Lambeg is unclear. It is commonly believed to have come to Ulster with English settlers in the early- mid-17th century. Other accounts state it came to Ireland with the Duke of Schomberg's men of the army of William of Orange during the Williamite war. Having its roots in the 17th century European military instruments it was originally smaller. Traditionally it was accompanied by the shrill fife, a small transverse flute similar to the piccolo. Over time, the drum grew in size through emulousness between players. The drum eventually got to such a scale that the fifes were drowned out. Today the fife and Lambeg together are the exception rather than the norm in parades; the combination is most common in County Antrim. Most of the original Ulster fifers were of Flemish descent. A number of French Huguenots had followed William's army into Ireland and the Flemish, English and Scottish Protestant groups had united into the Orange Order. The name comes from the village of Lambeg, County Antrim, which is situated ten miles southwest of Belfast and two miles from Lisburn. Tradition has it, that it was in the Lambeg area that the instrument was first played with canes. The drum is sometimes also called \\"tibbies\\", \\"slashers\\", or \\"killymans\\". Construction The Lambeg drum's shell is generally made of oak. Lambeg drum heads are goat skins, they are very thin and strong, and of even thickness and consistency all over as far as possible. A Lambeg skin will also receive \\"special\\" treatment that is a secret to each maker. Because of their qualities they are also sometimes used for smaller drums such as bodhr√°ns. The Lambegs are different from other large drums in the quality of their tone. The thin heads are pulled tighter and tighter until the tone is bright and hard. There are no mechanical screws on the drums. The heads are held on with a wooden rim and, traditionally, linen ropes.

A native of Colombia in South America, he served in the Colombian army and in 1834 attempted a scientific survey of the territory between Socorro and the Magdalena River. Seven years later he explored western Colombia from Antioquia to Anserma studying its topography, its natural history and the traces of its aboriginal inhabitants. In 1845 he went to Spain to examine such documentary material concerning Colombia and its colonial history as was then accessible, and three years later he published his Compendio, a work on the discovery and colonization of New Granada (Colombia). The map accompanying this work, now out of date, was very fair for the time, and the work itself is still valuable for its abundant bibliographic references and biographic notes. What he says in it of the writings of Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada the conqueror of New Granada, is very incomplete and in many ways erroneous, but his biographies remain a guide to the student of Spanish-American history. One year after the Compendio, another work called Semenario appeared at Paris, embodying the botanical papers of Francisco Jos√© de Caldas.

It is a comedy laced with typically \\"Pinteresque\\" ambiguity and \\"implications of threat and strong feeling produced through colloquial language, apparent triviality, and long pauses\\" (Oxford English Dictionary). Setting The Collection takes place on a divided stage, shared by a house in London's Belgravia, and a flat in Chelsea, with another space between them where telephone calls take place; according to Pinter's stage description, the \\"three areas\\" comprise \\"two peninsulas and a promontory\\" (Three Plays [43]). Bill, a dress designer in his twenties, lives with Harry, a man in his forties, in Harry's house, in Belgravia, which has \\"Elegant decor\\" (Three Plays [43]). Stella, another dress designer, in her thirties like her husband and business partner James, lives with him in \\"James' flat\\" in Chelsea, which has \\"Tasteful contemporary furnishing.\\" According to Pinter's stage description, whereas the set for Harry's house (\\"Stage left\\") \\"comprises the living-room, hall, front door and staircase to the first floor,\\" with a \\"Kitchen exit below staircase,\\" the set for James's flat in Chelsea (\\"Stage right\\") \\"comprises the living-room only,\\" while \\"Off stage right\\" there are \\"other rooms and front door\\" and \\"Up stage centre on promontory [a] telephone box,\\" where the phone calls are made (Three Plays [43]). Plot synopsis The plot concerns whether or not Stella and Bill had a one-night stand while away on business in Leeds. One evening while at home Harry (Kane) and Bill (Lloyd), a dress designer, receive an unsettling anonymous phone call (48), which is to be followed by a further unsettling visit from a man who will refuse to leave his name (49). Following some apparently trivial conversation between Stella, another dress designer, and James (Horne), her husband and business partner, that occurs in his flat (44‚Äì45), James has left it to call on Bill at Harry's house, revealing that he was the anonymous caller and is the unexpected visitor. James confronts Bill with the confession of his wife Stella that she has had a one-night affair with Bill (53‚Äì55). Bill first claims that she invented the story (58‚Äì59), but he admits to their having \\"kissed a bit\\" (59), he qualifies \\"that it never happened . . . what you say anyway,\\" and further renders that version ambiguous: > JAMES: [...] Then I phoned. > Pause. > I spoke to her. [...] You were sitting on the bed, next to her. > BILL: Not sitting. Lying. (59) James's obsession to meet the man who has purportedly cuckolded him‚Äì‚Äìsuggesting archetypal symbolic significance in Pinter's choice of his surname (Horne)‚Äì‚Äì and to confront him with \\"the truth\\" culminates in a \\"mock duel\\" with household knives (72‚Äì73), in which Bill is scarred. Harry then intervenes and relates to James Stella's alleged admission that she has invented the whole story and the two never really met (in fact, what she has told him is that James was the one who \\"dreamed it up\\"). Bill confirms that nothing happened, and Harry viciously chastises him, calling him a \\"slum slug\\" with a \\"slum mind\\" and claiming that he \\"confirms stupid sordid little stories just to amuse himself, while everyone else has to run round in circles to get to the root of the matter and smooth the whole thing out\\". (78) As James is about to leave, Bill suddenly changes his story for the last time and tells James: \\"we sat ... in the lounge, on a sofa for two hours ... talked we talked about it ... we didn't move from the lounge never went to her room ... just talked about what we would do ... if we did get to her room two hours ... we never touched ... we just talked about it.\\" James then goes back home and confronts his wife with this final version of \\"the truth\\"‚Äì‚Äì > You didn't do anything, did you? > Pause. > That's the truth, isn't it? > Pause. > You just sat and talked about what you would do, if you went to your room. > That's what you did. > Pause. > Didn't you? > Pause. > That's the truth . . . isn't it?\\"‚Äì‚Äì in response to which Stella \\"looks at him, neither confirming nor denying. Her face [...] friendly, sympathetic\\" (79‚Äì80), ultimately maintaining both the play's ambiguity and an uneasy status quo in the relationships of the two couples.

The choir was founded by a Belgian and missionary, the Reverend Father Leo Renier, CICM, who was assistant parish priest of St. Joseph's Parish and who believed that the parish's Bamboo Organ could achieve its full glory if there was a good choir to accompany it. Therefore, in September, 1969, three months after his arrival in the Parish, Fr. Leo began recruiting young boys between 8 and 12 years from the parochial as well as public schools in Las Pi√±as. History The choir was initially known as the ‚ÄúHimig Kawayan Boys Choir of Las Pi√±as‚Äù. This was an attempt to make a connection with the Bamboo Organ. Its first public performance was during Midnight Mass, Christmas 1969. During the first years, rehearsals were held on the ground-floor of the parish rectory, with a small harmonium as accompaniment. Occasionally, an Orff- instrumentarium was used as well. In 1972, the choir participated in the First National Children‚Äôs Choir Competition placed third. This quest for excellence also demanded a full-time conductor. In April 1973, Engracio Tempongko was hired to train and conduct the choir. He had been formerly training the Manila Cathedral Boys‚Äô Choir under Fr. John Vande Steen, and the Santo Domingo Boys‚Äô Choir. The name ‚ÄúHimig Kawayan‚Äù was dropped. The newly adopted name simply referred to the location, and the official name was born: the ‚ÄúLas Pi√±as Boys Choir‚Äù The choir also now acquired an official ‚Äúchoir-room‚Äù on the ground- floor of the old building which was replaced later by the 5-storey building. The location was the site of the present stage in the auditorium.. When the choir participated in the 3rd National Competition of Children‚Äôs Choirs on November 23, it captured the First Prize. The LPBC had its first performance outside Manila two weeks later, in Baguio, on December 6. Numerous appearances and command performances in Malaca√±ang and the Cultural Center of the Philippines followed. In the meantime, two important events had taken place in Las Pi√±as. First, the interior of the church had been restored. Its inauguration took place on December 2, 1972. Secondly, the Bamboo Organ had been transported to the workshop of Johannes Klais in Bonn, Germany to undergo a complete restoration on July 28, 1973. The Bamboo Organ returned on March 13, 1975 and was inaugurated during a gala-concert on May 9, 1975 where the LPBC was part of the program. From then on, the life of the choir became closely intertwined with the historic Bamboo Organ. When Engracio Tempongko left the LPBC in December 1979, Fr. Leo became its conductor again, after a short stint under Mrs. Emma V. Tantengco and Mrs. Zenas R. Lozada. Armando Salarza became the official accompanist of the choir during the last two years of his high school, before leaving for further studies in Austria in 1982. The high standards for musical performance set by the annual International Bamboo Organ Festival challenged the choirboys. Up to 1978, the members simply memorized most of their parts. However, in order to master the more extensive scores of the classical choral works, it became imperative for the members to know how to read notes. Thus, solfeggio classes were introduced for the preparatory group under Ms. Donna Ofrasio, who was the accompanist in residence of the LPBC for some fifteen years. The International Bamboo Organ Festival became the highlight of the choir life. Sometimes, rehearsals for a major work started up to eight months ahead of the actual performance. This event became an opportunity for the boys to get acquainted with the works of the masters and to perform more than once in their lifetime with a full orchestra, led by local as well as foreign conductors. The LPBC can proudly look backward at the catalogue of choral works performed over the years. Other highlights were the yearly Simbang Gabi and the celebration of the Holy Week. Another development was the expansion of the choir with a male section, so that the broader repertory for mixed voices could be performed during the liturgy. And so it became possible to perform during the High Mass on Sundays, once or twice a month. The existence of a choir composed of boy sopranos and adult males resulted in a second recording of Christmas Carols called ‚ÄúA Philippine Christmas at the Las Pi√±as Bamboo Organ‚Äù. Conductor was Vince Gomez, a Filipino American who was working with the Metro Manila Symphony Orchestra. The choir was accompanied at the bamboo organ by Manuel P. Maramba. And the recording was done by Josef Kamykowski from Vienna on February 20, 21 and 23, 1982. In July 1989, three boys of the LPBC flew to Paris to join the ‚ÄúWorld‚Äôs Little Singers‚Äù, a choir composed of representatives from 14 different countries, on the occasion of the bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution. They sang ‚ÄúBayan Ko!‚Äù arranged for three voices and piano by Fr. Maramba. Their excellent life performance has been recorded on a CD. In November 1990, the LPBC went on a concert tour to Naga City, Sorsogon, Cavite and Bulacan as part of the Outreach and Exchange Program of the CCP. Armando Salarza came back from his studies in Graz and Vienna in 1992, while Gerardo Fajardo returned in 1998. The time had come for Fr. Leo to take a bow and give way to the younger generation. The 25th anniversary of the choir was celebrated during the 19th International Bamboo Organ Festival on February 22, 1994, with the performance of the ‚ÄúMissa de Beata Virgine‚Äù by G. P. Palestrina. A former member of the LPBC, Gerardo Fajardo, conducted the choir, while Armando Salarza was accompanying at the organ. A day earlier, another historic event had taken place. The first Filipino-made pipe organ was inaugurated. It was constructed by Cealwyn Tagle, yet another LPBC alumni, and Edgar Montiano. The transition was not without difficulties. The conductor's baton was passed from one after another; Boy Delarmente, then Renato Cortez and then Ricardo Mazo, who stayed at the helm of the choir for two years. In May 1999, when the CICM fathers transferred the parish to the diocesan clergy, Gerardo Fajardo was reinstated as choirmaster. Since 2003, the Las Pinas Boys Choir is being trained by Prof. Armando Salarza, Titular Organist of the Bamboo Organ. In December 2004, LPBC was invited to perform at the \\"Amazements EU Christmas\\", a concert at the Podium mall. Since their founder Fr. Renier is a Belgian national, the choirboys were the finale number for the Belgians' participation. They won awards from the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) and the Vivere Choral competition held 2005. A series of concerts were held for the year 2007-2008 in preparation for their participation in the 5th World Choir Games in Graz, Austria, July, 2008. The Las Pi√±as Boys Choir (LPBC) emerged victorious in the two categories it competed in during the World Choir Games 2008 held in Graz, Austria. They got the Silver Medal in the Musica Sacra category, and the Gold Medal and declared World Champion in the Children's Choir category. The 20-member Las Pi√±as Boys Choir, based in St. Joseph Church in Las Pi√±as, home of the world-famous Bamboo Organ, bested 54 other children's choir groups from all over the world including those from the United States, Greece, Estonia, Great Britain, Russia and South Africa. Most choirs that competed in the Musica Sacra category are professional choirs and consisted of around 40-60 members. The same goes for the children‚Äôs choir category. Most children‚Äôs choirs had 40 to 70 members. However, 20 boys of the Las Pi√±as Boys Choir (LPBC) still captivated and conquered the world! Professor Armando Salarza is the conductor and trainer. Staff and consultants are January Hernandez, Norie Salarza, Leo and Donna Renier. Management Team is Msgr. Albert Venus and Fr. Didoy Molina. In honor of LPBC's achievement, Senate President and former Las Pi√±as Representative Manuel Villar Jr filed a senate resolution commending the group‚Äôs performance. \\"The feat of our very own Las Pi√±as Boys Choir exhibits the excellence of the global Pinoys whose dedication and commitment to their craft bring honor and pride to the country,\\" Senator Villar said in a statement. =Recordings= Two LP-records were made. The first one was recorded on the occasion of the Inaugural Concerts of the Bamboo Organ in 1975, with Wolfgang Oehms on the organ. The second was recorded a few months later and released with the title: ‚ÄúChristmas Carols on the Las Pi√±as Bamboo Organ,‚Äù, with Zenas Reyes Lozada as accompanist.

Shahe fen is often stir fried with meat and/or vegetables in a dish called chao fen (ÁÇíÁ≤â; pinyin: ch«éo fƒõn). While chao fen is a transliteration of Mandarin, chow fun from Cantonese (see the main article at beef chow fun) is the name most often given to the dish in Chinese restaurants in North America. Names While shahe fen and he fen are transliterations based on Mandarin, there are numerous other transliterations based on Cantonese, which include ho fun, hofoen (a Dutch transliteration in Suriname), hor fun, sar hor fun, etc. In addition, shahe fen is often synonymously called kway teow (), literally \\"ricecake strips\\", transliteration based on Minnan Chinese, POJ: k√≥e-ti√¢u) or in Mandarin, guotiao (Mandarin pinyin: gu«íti√°o), as in the name of a dish called char kway teow. However, shahe fen and kway teow are strictly and technically not the same (the latter being essentially ricecakes sliced into strips) and the Minnan people in general still consciously make a distinction between shahe fen and guotiao/kway teow in their speech. Hor fun was perfected by the Cantonese and is thin and tapered like strips of tape, with some porous areas that absorb the gravy, taste, and flavour of the broth or sauce that it is cooked in because it contains less starchy content, which has been stripped away during the production process. In contrast, guotiao/kuay teow is dense, and less absorbent and contains a higher level of starch and is more impermeable to absorbing flavours, and thus has to be soaked for a longer period of time in the dish preparation usually for a day or more, or is soaked in water first for a long time before it is fried as char kway teow. The taste, texture, flavour, ingredients, length, thickness, width, style, density are very different for Chinese and Asian palates, but most foreigners may not be able to tell the difference immediately. Guotiao/kway teow has a different origin from shahe fen , from Northeast instead of Central China, and is a modification of the guo/kway (ricecake) production process, and originated as the ancient preservation of rice as a starch-filled cake patty (of which Korean rice strips are yet another descendant, as it was brought as a recipe from China to Choseon dynasty when the Emperor of China during the Ming dynasty took the Korean princess as one of his concubines, and this recipe was gifted to the people of Choseon as a betrothal gift to the Korean people). In Hokkien (Fujian) of China, this version of guotiao/kway teow was then influenced by the Cantonese shahe fen from the neighboring province of Guangdong. Cantonese culture from the 17th century onwards was thought of as the dominant culture of civilization and culture, of wealth, excess, and sophistication, so the ancient guotiao/kway teow underwent modification to become similar to the standard Cantonese shahe fen/hor fun. However, these two versions (guotiao/kway teow vs. shahe fen/hor fun) were spread to Southeast Asia and the world differently, thus they are presented differently in different dishes. Good Chinese restaurants do not mix up or confuse the two, but more casual versions of Chinese takeout often use the two interchangeably. Original ricecakes and its strips (i.e. authentic guotiao/kway teow) are stiff in texture, even after cooking, making them unpopular with modern consumers. Another similar noodle confused by Westerners is the nee tai mak which is like the hor fun and the bee hoon combined with Milanese pasta. It is also known in Sabah as da fen (), means \\"wide vermicelli\\", due to its similarity of colour and texture to rice vermicelli. These noodles are called guay tiew sen yai (, meaning \\"large rice noodles\\") in Thailand, kwetiau in Indonesia and pho in Vietnam as its counterpart version. Origin Sliced fish hor fun sold in Bukit Batok, Singapore Shahe fen is believed to have originated in the town of Shahe (), now part of the Tianhe District in the city of Guangzhou, in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, whence their name derives. Shahe fen is typical of southern Chinese cuisine, although similar noodles are also prepared and enjoyed in nearby Southeast Asian nations such as Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, all of which have sizeable Chinese populations. Types Wide shahe fen stir-fried with soy sauce, as served in Switzerland Shahe fen noodles are white in color, broad, and somewhat slippery. Their texture is elastic and a bit chewy. They do not freeze or dry well and are thus generally (where available) purchased fresh, in strips or sheets that may be cut to the desired width. Where fresh noodles are not available, they may also be purchased packaged in dried form, in various widths. Shahe fen noodles are very similar to Vietnamese b√°nh ph·ªü noodles, which are likely derived from their Chinese counterpart. Although the ph·ªü noodles used in soups may vary in width, wide ph·ªü noodles are also common in stir fried dishes. The popular Thai dishes phat si-io and drunken noodles are also made with similar noodles. Chao fen Shahe fen is often stir-fried with meat and vegetables in a dish called chao fen (ÁÇíÁ≤â; pinyin: ch«éo fƒõn). While chao fen is a transliteration of Mandarin, chow fun, from Cantonese, is the name to which this dish is most often referred in Chinese restaurants in North America.

Before becoming bishop he was chamberlain of Archbishop Anno II of Cologne and, for a time, tutor of Prince Henry, the future Emperor Henry IV. When the excommunicated Bishop William of Utrecht died in 1076, the emperor gave the episcopal see of Utrecht to Conrad, who, like his predecessor, sided with Henry IV in his conflicts with Gregory VII, and at the Synod of Brixen in 1080 even condemned the pope as a heretic. The contemporary annalist, Lambert of Hersfeld, calls Conrad a schismatic bishop, unworthy of holding an episcopal see. In a battle with Robert I, Count of Flanders, Conrad was defeated, afterwards taken captive and compelled to yield part of West Frisia to Robert. This territorial loss of the bishop was compensated by the emperor, who, in 1077, gave him the district of Stavoren, and in 1086 added the two other Frisian districts, Oostergo and Westergo. He was in Rome when king Henry was crowned by the pope as emperor in 1084. Conrad is the founder and architect of the collegiate church of Notre-Dame at Utrecht. He was assassinated, shortly after completing the Holy Sacrifice, by his Frisian architect whom he had discharged, and who, in the opinion of some, was instigated by a certain nobleman whose domains Conrad held unjustly. The church of Saint Mary in Utrecht got a chapter during his reign. He is said to have written the discourse Pro Imperatore contra Papam, and to have delivered it at the Synod of Gerstungen in 1085. It is inserted by Johannes Aventinus (d. 1534) in his Vita Henrici IV and by Goldast (d. 1635) in his Pro Henrico IV imperatore. HefeleConciliengeschichte, V, 180, note. is of the opinion that the discourse is falsely attributed to Conrad of Utrecht, and that Aventinus himself is the author. He was killed at Utrecht by a Frisian on 14 April 1099.

XML Schema is a modern XML schema language designed by W3C XML Schema Working Group. W3C intended XML Schema to supersede traditional DTD (Document Type Definition). XML Schema supports so many features that its specification is large and complex. Murata, James Clark and those who criticised XML Schema, pointed out the following: * It is difficult to implement all features of XML Schema. * It is difficult for engineers to read and write XML Schema definitions. * It does not permit nondeterministic content models. Murata and collaborators designed another modern schema language, RELAX (Regular Language description for XML), more simple and mathematically consistent. They published RELAX specification in 2000. RELAX was approved as JIS and ISO/IEC standards. At roughly the same time, James Clark also designed another schema language, TREX (Tree Regular Expressions for XML). Murata and James Clark designed a new schema language RELAX NG based on TREX and RELAX Core. RELAX NG syntax is the expansion of TREX. RELAX NG was approved by OASIS in December 2001.

The Bantu also belong to the Copperbelt Provinces of Zambia who trace their origins to the Luba and Lunda states of the upper Congo basin called Kola, in what became Katanga Province in southern Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Bemba entered modern-day Zambia through crossing the Luapula River at Chipya in the Senior Chief Matanda's Chiefdom in Mansa _Luapula Province and that Chief Matanda (Mwata Matanda) and his Ushi people were the first to come into Zambia by the year 1328 from Kola. The collection of ethnicities known as Bemba have a ruling class called Abena Ng'andu. This clan traces its ancestry to Mbemba Nshinga (aka Nzinga) who ruled Kongo from 1509-1543. Mbemba was called King Afonso l by the Portuguese whom he hosted in his kingdom for many years. They are one of the larger ethnic groups in Zambia. (A few other ethnic groups in the Northern, Luapula, and Copperbelt provinces of Zambia speak languages that are similar to Bemba but are not necessarily the same. For example, although the Lamba have the same roots as the Bemba, they never relied on the Bemba aristocracy for leadership. Indeed the Bemba people are not strictly indigenous to the Copperbelt Province, having rejoined the Lamba in that province in the 1930s when they went their in large numbers in search of employment opportunities brought about by the opening of large scale copper mines. In contrast members of the Bisa royal family are almost all descendants of Chitimukulu, as are many members of the Swaka and Lala aristocracies. Bemba history is a major historical phenomenon in the development of chieftainship in a large and culturally homogeneous region of central Africa. The Lamba people who are indigenous to the Copperbelt Province are also present in the Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The following are Lamba chiefs in that region of DRC: Chief Saili (Lumbembe area), chief Katala (Mokambo), chief Mfundamina (Mfundamina ), chief Kombe (kombo), chief Katanga (Lubumbashi ) it is interesting to note that even the name of the province is taken from one of the Lamba chiefs. Chief Nsakanya (sakania), chief Kaponda (Likasi), chief Nshindaika (Likasi). There are 8 Lamba chiefs in Katanga province, and there are 15 Lamba chiefs in Zambia. Some distinguish between Bemba speaking people and ethnic Bembas. The traditional ruler of ethnic Bembas is Chitimukulu. They lived in villages of 100 to 200 people and numbered 250,000 strong in 1963. There are over 30 Bemba clans, named after animals or natural organisms, such as the royal clan, \\"the people of the crocodile\\" (Bena Ng'andu) or the Bena Bowa (Mushroom Clan). They were the people who finally put a halt to the northward march of the Nguni and Sotho-Tswana descended Ngoni people, through Chief Chileshe Chitapankwa Muluba. The BaShimba Leopard Clan or bena Ngo living among the Bemba people are part of the Basimba people now living in Tanzania, Uganda and the DR Congo. In contemporary Zambia, the word \\"Bemba\\" originally meant great expanse like the sea, the name the Luba descended tribe called itself after conquering a large expanse of land in what is now northern Zambia. Today the meaning has been altered to mean several meanings. It may designate people of Bemba origin, regardless of where they live, e.g. whether they live in urban areas or in the original rural Bemba area. Alternatively, it may encompass a much larger population that includes some 'eighteen different ethnic groups', who together with the Bemba form a closely related ethnolinguistic cluster of matrilineal-matrifocal agriculturalists known as the Bemba-speaking peoples of Zambia. Colonialism and destruction of local traditions have somewhat distorted the history of Africans and the Bemba are no exception. The Bemba history is more aligned to the tribes of East Africa rather than the tribes of western Zambia. The fact that the Bemba are said to have come from Kola was misinterpreted by the Europeans to mean Angola. Bemba folklore passed on from generation to generation cites the origin of the Bemba tribe as having originated from a woman who fell from heaven called Mumbi Mukasa and who had long ears. The Kikuyu of Kenya have the same folklore and similar traditions including the way they built their tradition huts. When the Bemba arrived in their present territory they had guns. The Bemba have a rich vocabulary which includes deserts and camels, certainly not something they would have known from Angola. Western text is a useful guide but needs to be looked at as such. The History of AbaBemba (15th century to Present) =Pre-1808= AbaBemba (the Bemba people) of Zambia in Central Africa are Bantus. The historiography of AbaBemba begins in the 15th century, when the 1484-1485 Portuguese expedition under Diego Cam (also known as Diogo C√£o) was launched whereupon the Europeans first made contact with the mouth of the Congo River and interacted with the Kongo Kingdom. Currently, there is no textus receptus of Bemba history; so, much of what is known about AbaBemba, especially about their early formative years, is a reasoned synthesis of scattered bits of history. Such history includes Bemba oral traditions (Mushindo, 1977; Tanguy, 1948), historical texts on early imperialist and colonialist ventures and post-Berlin conference European undertakings in the region (Bandinel, 1842; Richards, 1939; Roberts, 1970; Tweedie, 1966), inferences from historiographical mentions of well-known Bemba individuals (Bandinel, 1842; Gondola, 2002; Reid, 2012), tie-ups with the historical writings on other Central African kingdoms (African Elders & Labrecque, 1949; Gondola, 2002; Reid, 2012), and Bemba-focussed historiographical endeavors of the past century (Mushindo, 1977; Roberts, 1970; Roberts, 1973; Tanguy, 1948). Around the year 1484, Diego Cam came across the Congo River on the Atlantic central African coast (Bandinel, 1842). He explored the river and came into contact with the Kongo Kingdom, a Bantu kingdom that covered a vast area in many parts of the present countries of Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Congo- Brazzaville. The ruling monarch of the Kongo at that time was Nzinga a Nkuwu (Gondola, 2002). Locally, the monarchical title was Mani Kongo or Mwene Kongo which translated as ‚Äòthe owner of the Kongo Kingdom‚Äô. Nzinga (known by AbaBemba as Nshinga) was Mwene Kongo VII. ‚ÄòNkuwu‚Äô, with the grammatical prefix ‚Äòa‚Äô, is a patronymic: Mwene Kongo Nzinga was a son of Nkuwu. Primarily through the efforts of Catholic missionaries, the Portuguese greatly influenced the internal politics of the Kongo Kingdom: Mwene Kongo VII Nzinga a Nkuwu was baptized in 1491 as Jo√£o I (John I) the name of a Portuguese king (Gondola, 2002; Tanguy, 1948). Mwene Kongo Nzinga died in 1506[1] and was succeeded by his son Mvemba a Nzinga (Mvemba son of Nzinga). Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba (also known as Muhemba, Mbemba, or Mubemba) also underwent Christian baptism and received a Portuguese regal name as his baptismal name: Alfonso I (Reid, 2012). Shortly after the 1543 death of Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba, a Nzinga (Alfonso Mubemba), early progenitors of AbaBemba rebelled against the Kongo Kingdom, which was becoming heavily influenced and dominated by the Portuguese, particularly through Christian conversion, slavery, trade, and European education. These rebels broke away from the Kongo Kingdom, migrated eastwards from their settlements in Kola, and became an integral part of the Luba Kingdom in the present-day Democratic Republic of Congo (Tanguy, 1948). A 17th century anti-Portuguese rebellion in the Luba Kingdom led to another eastward movement of the breakaway group that would later be known as AbaBemba. From the Luba Kingdom, the rebels were led by two of Luba King Mukulumpe‚Äôs sons: Nkole and Chiti (Mushindo, 1977; Tanguy, 1948). The mother of Nkole and Chiti was Mumbi Lyulu Mukasa of the Bena-Ng‚Äôandu clan. Since then, Bena-Ng‚Äôandu has become the royal clan of AbaBemba. A crocodile (ing‚Äôwena in modern Bemba; ing‚Äôandu in old Bemba) is the totemic object of the clan. Today, in the highly protected royal archives (babenye) at the palace of the Chitimukulu, are four Christian statues obtained 600 years ago from early Catholic missionaries in the Kongo Kingdom. Mwene Kongo VIII Mvemba a Mzinga (Alfonso Mubemba), is regarded as the ur-ancestor of AbaBemba. The onomatopoetic similarities between -vemba (in Mvemba) and ‚Äìbemba (in AbaBemba) as well as the existence of the Christian statues in the royal archives (banenye) historically connect AbaBemba to the Kongo Kingdom. The proto- AbaBemba migrated from the Luba Kingdom, crossed the Luapula River and settled first at Isandulula (below Lake Mweru), then at Keleka (near Lake Bangweulu), at Chulung‚Äôoma, and then at Kashi-ka-Lwena. Afterwards they then crossed the Chambeshi River at Safwa Rapids and settled at Chitabata, Chibambo, Ipunga, Mungu, and Mulambalala. Then they crossed the Chambeshi River again moving back west at Chikulu. A royal omen at the Milando River supposedly compelled AbaBemba to settle and cease their migrations (Mushindo, 1977; Tanguy, 1948; Tweedie, 1966). This settlement was named Ng‚Äôwena and became the first capital of UluBemba - the Bemba Kingdom. The Bemba-Ngoni wars of the 19th century were fought in the region around Ng‚Äôwena. From the time AbaBemba established themselves as a distinct grouping to the time of the 21st Chitimukulu, the Bemba were said to have been ruled by a single Paramount Chief or King (Roberts, 1970, 1973; Tanguy, 1948). However, during the reign of the 22nd Chitimukulu at the end of the 18th century, AbaBemba became markedly more expansionist. Chitimukulu Mukuka wa Malekano started pushing AbaLungu (the Lungu people) out of the present-day Kasama area. When he had forced AbaLungu to move west and settle on the western side of the Luombe River, the geographical coverage of the Bemba Kingdom had grown to such extent that it was not practical to manage it from UluBemba. So, Chitimukulu Mukuka wa Malekano gave the newly acquired Ituna area to his young brother Chitundu as a separate Mwamba Kingdom, a tributary state of the Bemba Kingdom (Mushindo, 1977; Tanguy, 1948). Chitundu became Mwine Tuna, Mwamba I. =1808 and later= The Kazembe kingdom in its prime in the first half of the 19th Century. Under the 23rd Chitimukulu Chilyamafwa AbaBemba expansion continued in the years leading up to 1808. Chitimukulu pushed AbaMambwe (the Mambwe people) north, creating the area that would be called Mpanda. At the same time Chitimukulu Chilyamafwa‚Äôs young brother, Mubanga Kashampupo, who had ascended to the Mwamba throne as Mwine Tuna Mwamba II, continued pushing AbaLungu west and south, creating the Kalundu area. Chitimukulu Chilyamafwa created a vassal Mpanda kingdom over which his son Nondo-mpya would reign as Makasa I; Mwamba Kashampupo created a vassal Kalundu kingdom over which his son would rule as Munkonge I (Tanguy, 1948). Future Bemba kings continued the conquests, with both the 25th Chitimukulu, Chileshe Chepela (1810-1860), and the 27th Chitimukulu, Mutale Chitapankwa (1866-1887) bringing nearby tribes under their rule. By the time the first major European presence began to make itself known in Zambia at the end of the 1800s, AbaBemba had pushed out many earlier immigrants to the Tanganyika plateau: including the Tabwa, Bisa, Lungu, and Mambwe. UluBemba extended to varying degrees as far north as Lake Tanganyika, south-west to the swamps of Lake Bangweulu, eastwards to the Muchinga Escarpment and Luangwa Valley, and as far as Lake Mweru in the west. AbaBemba was sub-divided into over fifteen chieftainships under the reign of Chitimukulu‚Äôs various brothers, sons, and nephews. Richards (1939) observes that the political influence of the Chitimukulu covered much of the area marked out by the four great lakes (Mweru, Bangweulu, Tanganyika, and Nyasa) and extended south into the Lala and Lamba country in present-day Central and Copperbelt Provinces in Zambia. Despite the advent of colonial rule and later independence, many Bemba political institutions remain similar to their old forms. The Chitimukulu is the Mwine Lubemba (owner of the Bemba kingdom) and Paramount chief; UluBemba is divided into semi-autonomous chieftainship under the reign of the Chitimukulu‚Äôs brothers, sons, and nephews. Nkula and Mwamba are the senior brothers of the Chitimukulu and are usually the heirs to the Chitimukulu's throne; Nkole Mfumu and Mpepo are the junior brothers of the Chitimukulu. Nkole Mfumu usually comes to the Mwamba throne while Mpepo usually comes to the Nkole Mfumu throne. Occasionally, Mpepo and Nkole Mfumu have gone directly to the Chitimukulu throne. Of the sons of Chitimukulu, Makasa is the senior. Since the establishment of the Protectorate in the early 20th century in the reign of the 30th Chitimukulu, Mutale Chikwanda (1911-1916), the Chitimukulu throne is now more cultural and ceremonial than executive and administrative. However, this has not completely removed the Paramount Chief's political importance. The current Chitimukulu, Chitimukulu Kanyanta-manga II, is the 38th on the Chitimukulu throne. He came to the throne in August 2013 and was crowned on 31 July 2015. In 2016, Chitimukulu Kanyanta-manga II wrote an article entitled: The Illusive Role of the Chitimukulu reflecting on the institution he had assumed. This article set out the leadership roles the 38th Chitimukulu sought to assume.\\"The illusive role of the Chitimukulu as the chief executive of the Bemba people and tribe,\\" Lusaka Times published 20 May 2016. Soon afterward, the Paramount Chief put out his own socio-economic development agenda for the Bemba kingdom, envisioning the establishment of an UluBemba Academy and resolving to harness tourism and industrial potential for his people. All developmental and investment programs are to be coordinated by the already-established UluBemba Investment Centre, which Chitimukulu Kanyanta-manga II was responsible for setting up. Language A Bemba speaker, recorded in Zambia for Wikitongues. The Bemba language (Ichibemba) is most closely related to the Bantu languages Kiswahili in East Africa, Kaonde (in Zambia and the DRC), Luba (in the DRC), Nsenga and Tonga (in Zambia), and Nyanja/Chewa (in Zambia and Malawi). In Zambia, Chibemba is mainly spoken in the Northern, Luapula and Copperbelt Provinces, and has become the most widely spoken African language in the country, although not always as a first language.  Culture  Many Bemba are slash-and-burn agriculturists with manioc and finger millet being their main crops. However, many Bemba also raise goats, sheep, and other livestock. Some Bemba are also employed in the mining industry. Traditional Bemba society is matrilineal where close bonds between women or a mother and daughter are considered essential.Mwine Lubemba Chitimukulu Kanyanta-manga II. The current Chitimukulu of the Bemba people. He ascended to the throne in 2013.  Quotes from the Studies of AbaBemba  Richards (1939, pp. 29‚Äì30) observes that AbaBemba > ‚Äú‚Ä¶are obsessed with problems of status and constantly on the look-out for > their personal dignity, as is perhaps natural in a society in which so much > depends on rank.

It may be divided into two main branches, the orientalist/academic and the spiritual. Early Sufi studies in France The earliest Europeans to study Sufism were French, associated (rightly or wrongly) with the Quietist movement. They were Barth√©lemy d'Herbelot de Molainville (1625‚Äì1695), a professor at the Coll√®ge de France who worked from texts available in Europe, Fran√ßois Bernier (1625‚Äì1688), the physician of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb who spent 1655-69 in the Islamic world (mostly with Aurangzeb), and Fran√ßois P√©tis de la Croix (1653‚Äì1713), a diplomat who spent 1674-1676 in Isfahan, where he studied Rumi's Masnavi-ye Manavi and visited the Bektashi order. D'Herbelot's great work, the Biblioth√®que orientale (published posthumously in 1697), included an entry on Sufism (as tasawwuf) and detailed entries on Al-Hallaj, Najmeddin Kubra, and Abd-al-karim Jili. There were a number of references to the Masnavi and to Rumi (as Gellaledin Mohammed al Balkhi), and there may also have been entries on them. Bernier published an article on Sufism entitled \\"M√©moire sur le qu√Øetisme des Indes\\" in the periodical Histoire des Ouvrages des Savans in September 1688. Following this article, there is said to have developed in France a view that the French expression of the creed of Pure Love (Pur Amour/Quietism) was in fact a disguised form of Islam. The debate over Quietism between the bishops F√©nelon and Bossuet was remembered as the \\"Querelle du Pur Amour\\". Many Quietists (including Jeanne Marie Bouvier de la Motte Guyon) were imprisoned. Others exercised caution and self-censorship. P√©tis de la Croix did not publish himself, but his son (writing later under a pseudonym) gave reasons why he thought \\"the Mevlevi are perfect Qu√Øetists\\" (Ahmed Frangui, Lettres critiques de Hadgi Effendi √† la Marquise de G... au sujet des m√©moires de M. le Chevalier d'Arvieux, Paris, 1735). D'Herbelot de Molainville's Biblioth√®que orientale went through several editions, one of the last of which was the 1777 edition printed in the Hague. It has been suggested that some entries on Sufi topics that were present in the 1697 edition were absent from the 1777 edition. The word \\"Sufi\\" appears (vol 3, p. 329). Early translations In 1671, Edward Pococke (1648‚Äì1727), the son of Oxford professor Edward Pococke (1604‚Äì1691), published a Latin translation of the Hayy Ibn Yakhthan of Ibn Tufayl. This led to a number of other translations, including the English translations of 1674 (by George Keith) and 1686 (by George Ashwell), and a Dutch translation of 1701. The anonymous Dutch translator, \\"S.D.B.\\", gave a concise biographical review of the philosophers related to the text: Al Farabi, Avicenna, Al Ghazali, Ibn Bajjah, Ibn Rushd, Junayd, and Mansur Al-Hallaj (with a description of his death and a reference to his famous \\"Ana al-Haqq\\"). Hayy Ibn Yakhthan may have partly inspired Robinson Crusoe. In 1812, Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall published a translation of the divan of Hafiz, which was received with delight by Goethe, who was inspired by it to publish in 1819 his West√∂stlicher Diwan. A Sufi appears in Gotthold Ephraim Lessing‚Äôs play Nathan der Weise, first produced in 1779, though it is not clear from where Lessing learned of Sufism, perhaps through his association with Johann Jakob Reiske. In 1821, F.A.G. Th√∂lluck published Ssufismus sive Theosophia persarum pantheistica in Berlin (in Latin). Early sociological studies One of the earliest sociological treatments of Sufism is to be found in Sir John Malcolm's 1825 work, The History of Persia, From the Most Early Period to the Present Time, Containing an Account of the Religion, Government, Usages and Character of the Inhabitants of that Kingdom. Malcolm's treatment, though interesting, is not well informed. In An Account of the Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians written in Egypt during the years 1833-1835 (1836) Edward William Lane noted, and illustrated with his own woodcuts, his close observations of the Rifa'i derwishes while living in Cairo \\"in disguise\\". The success of his work also introduced the success of the \\"disguise\\". Sir Richard Burton's Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El- Medinah and Meccah (3 vol.1855-1856) was undertaken while travelling as a Qadiri, and Armin Vamb√©ry reached Baveddin near Bokhara to visit the shrine of Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari in 1863 in the guise of a murid. Voyage dans l'Asie Centrale, de T√©h√©ran a Khiva, Bokhara et Samarkand, par Arminius Vamb√©ry, savant Hongrois d√©guis√© en derviche was the subject of four instalments of the popular and copiously illustrated \\"Le Tour Du Monde, Nouveau Journal Des Voyages (√âdouard Charton)\\" Paris, Londres, Leipzig 1865, deuxi√®me semestre -Hachette et Cie ed. The \\"disguise\\" was by no means superficial and necessitated a variety of resources in linguistics and social integration that left marks far beyond the mere popular success of travelogues. Towards the end of the 19th century, the resistance to the European conquest of North Africa was often led by Sufis, notably Abd al-Qadir and later the Sanusi order. This drew further attention to Sufis and Sufism, and a number of studies were performed and published. These generally suffered from their authors' preoccupations with security. Agu√©li to Gu√©non One line of 20th century Sufi studies that came to fruition in the West appears to have been born from many colors in a painters workshop.Talk:Idries Shah#Shah on Naqshbandi It was the Swedish painter Ivan Agu√©li who ‚Äì inspired by the quasi occult tradition (Symbolist painters, Les Nabis) developing en marge of the great workshops of Paul Gauguin and √âmile Bernard ‚Äì took his intellectual search into the realm of Sufism proper. This culminated into his initiation, in Egypt, by Sheikh Rahman Elish Kabir into the Shadhili tariqa. When he returned to Paris from his travels in the East in 1909, he found a mind receptive to his own spiritual affiliation in the person of Ren√© Gu√©non whom in turn he initiated into the Shadhili Order (1912).Ren√© Gu√©non ‚Äì who finally settled in Cairo where he died (1951) a convert to Islam under his adopted name of Abdel Wahid Yahia ‚Äì had an enormous influence on a circle of friends centered around the periodical \\"La Gnose\\", that he had started in 1909. This circle pooled the resources of a.o. Frithjof Schuon, Titus Burckhardt, Marco Pallis, Ananda Coomaraswamy, Martin Lings e.a., each with his own focus on Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism ... (see also: Gershom Scholem on Judaism, Kabbalah) Ren√© Gu√©non focused on a measure of criticism towards what he called \\"solidified\\" (petrified) forms of initiation in the West; Freemasonry in particular which he sought to revive in reference to Emir Abd Al-Qadir whose name was widely respected among Masons. If one looks at the aspect of Sufi initiation proper the following background to Ren√© Gu√©non's brand of \\"Perennial Tradition\\" emerges. Through his affiliation with the Shadhili Order he was branched to the Akbari chain, going back to the \\"Greatest Sheikh\\" ‚Äì Shaykh Al-Akbar ‚Äì Ibn Arabi. Seminal research on the inspiration of Ibn Arabi and the Shadili and its projection in the works of Dante and St John of the Cross came from the great Christian scholar Miguel As√≠n Palacios Abd Al- Qadir and al-Tijani The Akbari already had a history of initiation in Western Europe in the person of Emir Abd Al-Qadir, the noble opponent of the French in their colonial struggle over Algeria, who they had held sequestered at the Ch√¢teau d'Amboise (1848‚Äì1853). In 1858 the Imprimerie Nationale (Paris) had printed his \\"Rappel √† l'Intelligent; avis √† l'Ignorant\\", an essay he had sent to the Soci√©t√© Asiatique in 1855. The Emir Abd Al-Qadir had been initiated into the Naqshbandi by Sheikh Diya al-Din Khalid Al-Sharazuri and into the Qadiri by his own father Sidi Muhiuddin who led a North African branch of the Qadiri Order. In 1863, during his Hajj, he met with Muhammed al- Fasi al-Shadili, who became his last living teacher, in Mekka. Muhammad al- Fasi al-Shadili's proper teacher had been initiated into the Shadhili by al- Arabi ad-Darqawi, some of whose letters were translated by Martin Lings (1961); they form the background to Martin Lings' outline of the autobiographical writings of Ahmad al-Alawi, who was linked to the Shadhili through ad-Darqawi. Sheikh Ahmad al-Alawi died in 1932. An approach from a different angle may be traced to Sheikh Ahmad al-Tijani who died in Fez in 1815 and was said to be the inheritor of the \\"paths\\" of his time, a.o. Qadiri and Shadili. Sheikh Hammalah ben Mohammed ben Sidna Omar, who died in forced exile to France, lies buried in Montlu√ßon, France. He was the former Qutub al Zaman of the Tijaniyyah. A moving account of the circumstances of his death is given by the great African traditionalist and cultural ambassador Amadou Hamp√¢t√© B√¢, himself a Tijani, in the biography of his own sheikh, Tierno Bokar. Massignon to Nasr Thus the current into which the friends of the Traditionalist School had tapped proved to be a lively one. Ren√© Gu√©non's wish to edit a series of Sufi translations was frustrated, but in the meantime Louis Massignon had prepared himself for the task. By 1922, his introduction to the technical lexicon of Sufism and the Passion of Al-Hallaj initiated the first line of textual study, translation and publication of sources that developed into the watershed of which the chief engineers were Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr. Since the observation is pertinent that thus far the watershed is fed from a distinct French sphere of influence, a mental exercise is needed to broaden the view. It is clear that Seyyed Hossein Nasr's participation in the collaboration with Henry Corbin infused this field with a genuine consideration for some of the finer aspects (Irfan) of Islamic culture as seen from a proper native source ‚Äì Iran ‚Äì and adding a distinct contemporary sting to ecology. It may be interesting to compare two contributions to Sufi studies from this same angle ‚Äì (1) Seyyed Hossein Nasr \\"Revelation, Intellect and Reason in the Qu'ran\\" in \\"Sufi Essays\\" ‚Äì London and Albany, New York 1972. ‚Äì (2) Reza Arasteh: \\"Psychology of the Sufi Way to Individuation\\" in \\"Sufi Studies East and West\\" Rushbrook Williams ed. New York 1973. Both describe the control over the \\"nafs\\", the spiritual \\"breaths\\" that color man's essential character; a study comparing intelligence in its western and eastern traditional form. Pr. Arasteh had already introduced this \\"Sufi Way\\" in his academical work on psychiatric theory (\\"Final Integration in Adult Personality\\" Brill Leiden 1965). Idries Shah Professor Reza Arasteh M. D. (remembered for his correspondence with Thomas Merton) wrote in honour of Sayyid Idries Shah, whose stature as a scholar was as fiercely disputed as his communication to a general public was successful. Nevertheless, Sayyid Idries Shah caused the English feed of the watershed to be explored ‚Äì through his own accessible style of writing, by providing affordable publications of great classical texts, and rebelliously askew on the niceties of an Oxford/Cambridge kind of rivalry over Pr. Nicholson and Pr. Arberry ‚Äì and to exactly what extent can now easily be verified by the student willing to compare for himself the eleven Naqshbandi rules or exercise-aims listed by Sayyid Idries Shah in chapter VII of Oriental Magic in 1957 with those presently divulged through the proper channel . They are indeed the same. \\"Oriental Magic\\" was read as a comparative study at the London Ethnological Institute. Sufi studies in general are directed as comparative studies of human understanding, and can be read as essays in psychosociology (see: Albert Hourani on \\"Marshall Hodgson and the Venture of Islam\\" in Islam in European Thought ‚Äì Cambridge University Press 1991). Margaret Smith Special note could be taken of the little cited but brilliant academic Margaret Smith who wrote (1925‚Äì1935) on the history of mysticism in the Near and Middle East from a woman's perspective leading to classic pages on early Christian mysticism, women in the early Christian Church, Christianity and Islam at the beginning of the Islamic era (see:Hanif), the rise of Sufism and the early ascetic ideal. Two exemplaries of her subject matter she studied in closer detail: Rabi'a al-'Adawiyya and Harith al-Muhasibi. The summary of her work reposes in her: :Studies in Early Mysticism in the Near and Middle East. Being an account of the rise and development of Christian mysticism up to the seventh century, of the subsequent development of mysticism in Islam, known as Sufism, and of the relationship between Christian and Islamic Mysticism with references, a bibliography and two indexes ::Dedicated to the memory of Thomas Walker Arnold ::London, 1931 ‚Äì The Sheldon Press; reprinted 1973 by Philo Press cv, Amsterdam Later academics By the end of the 20th century, the academic study of Sufism was well established in university departments of religious studies. The perspectives of these later scholars varied. Some were purely scientific, while some followed in the line of Massignon, or (sometimes privately) in the line of Gu√©non and the Traditionalists, modified somewhat for an academic environment.

But the lover who comes to call in the afternoons is revealed to be the husband adopting a role. He plays the lover for her: she plays the whore for him.

The train services are operated by the Festiniog Railway Company. \\"Waunfawr\\" is Welsh for \\"Big Heath\\". In 2000, in order to remodel the layout of the station, the old building was carefully taken down. Although carefully dismantled by the WH Heritage Group, the numbered and stored stone was inadvertently used as fill for the embankments, or to build a stone wall, by the contractor. Following reconstruction, the section from Waunfawr to Rhyd Ddu was formally reopened by the Prince of Wales on 30 July 2003. Prince Charles travelled from Waunfawr to Rhyd Ddu by special train. The station flower and shrub beds were laid out and are maintained by the local community enterprise charity, Antur Waunfawr.

Glebov was born in the village of Sukhoye, Oryol Oblast. In 1975 he was conscripted and served in the 23d Missile Brigade of the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany. In 1981 he graduated from a Higher Military School and served in a paratrooper division in Prienai, Lithuanian SSR. He participated in the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War as the chief of intelligence of the 350th Guards Airborne Regiment of the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, Soviet Airborne Troops, was heavily wounded and received a number of military awards including the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Red Star, two Medals For Courage and a number of Afghan orders. In 1990 Glebov entered Frunze Academy in Moscow and after graduating became the commander of the 119th Paratrooper Regiment. As the commander of the regiment Glebov took part in the First Chechen War including the Battle of Grozny (1994‚Äì1995). Glebov's paratroopers were first to cross the Sunzha River during the battle. For his service during the Chechen War Glebov received the Order of Courage and the Order of the Red Star. Even though he was cited, it is widely known in Russia and beyond that Glebov is a war-criminal and mass- murderer of innocent Chechen civilians. Rossiiskaya Gazeta discussed the case of Lieutenant Colonel Vladimir Glebov, commander of the 119th Parachute Regiment, who was arrested for the murder of dozens of Chechen civilians in a Grozny suburb during the first campaign. Glebov had been awarded the Hero of Russia medal ‚Äì Russia's highest military honour ‚Äì just days before his arrest. However, prosecutors claimed he had gunned down a group of unarmed men, then planted weapons on their bodies in a bid to claim credit for defeating an enemy unit. The newspaper pointed out that Glebov's case had later been shelved (as is typical of war-crimes cases in Russia) and the colonel was allowed to resign his commission without any blot on his military record. The case was also brought up in the trial of Yuri Budanov years later. Since 1997 Glebov works in police. Currently he is a deputy chief of police of Naro- Fominsk town in Moscow Oblast.

The house comprises a 15th-century tower, originally known as Lethington Castle, and has been extended several times, principally in the 17th, 19th and 20th centuries. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and is described by Historic Scotland as \\"one of Scotland's most ancient and notable houses.\\" The wooded estate is included on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. It is now the seat of the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon. History The lands of Lethington were acquired by Robert Maitland of Thirlestane in 1345. The Maitland family constructed the earliest part of the building, the L-plan tower house at the south-west of the building. Mary of Guise stayed at Lethington in 1548 when she came to see Haddington with Piero Strozzi. The following year it was burned by the English troops who were then occupying Haddington. Prominent members of the Maitland family included the poet Richard Maitland (1496‚Äì1586), his son William Maitland of Lethington (1525‚Äì1573), Secretary of State to Mary, Queen of Scots, and his son James Maitland of Lethington (b.1568). It was then acquired by his uncle, John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane (1537‚Äì1595), it was said in an underhanded manner. Sir John Scot of Scotstarvet, writing in the seventeenth century, commented thus: \\"Yet the conquest he made of the barony of Liddington [Lethington] from his brother's son, James Maitland, was not thought lawful nor conscientious.\\" James Maitland had become a Catholic and was obliged to leave Scotland. James VI of Scotland visited John Maitland, who was Chancellor of Scotland, at Lethington on 28 April 1593 to persuade him to return to court.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 82. The coach house was built around 1676, to designs by Sir William Bruce. Lethington remained in the Maitland family until after the death of John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale in 1682. =Lennoxlove= The property was purchased by the trustees of Frances Teresa Stuart, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox following her death in 1702 for the benefit of her \\"neare and deare kinsman the said Walter Stuart\\". Walter Stuart was the eldest son of Alexander, 5th Lord Blantyre, the firt cousin, twice removed, of the duchess, and was to become the 6th Lord Blantyre on the death of his father in 1704. The Duchess had stipulated that the property be called \\"Lennox's Love to Blantyre\\", this was subsequently shortened to Lennoxlove. It remained in the ownership of the Blantyre-Stewarts for almost two centuries. When the 12th Lord Blantyre died in 1900 without male heirs, the property passed into the ownership of his daughter, Ellen Stewart, and her husband Sir David Baird, 3rd Baronet of Newbyth, Prestonkirk. Their younger son, Major William Baird, commissioned the architect Sir Robert Lorimer to oversee extensive refurbishment of the house in 1912. Lennoxlove is now the seat of the Dukes of Hamilton, having been purchased by the 14th Duke in 1946. It is open to the public during the summer, accommodates corporate events and weddings, and can be rented privately by groups. Lennoxlove Book Festival This festival was started in November 2009, and it is being continued in November 2010. South fa√ßade of Lennoxlove House Art collection Lennoxlove is home to one of Scotland's most important collections of portraits, including works by Anthony van Dyck, Canaletto, Sir Peter Lely, Sir Godfrey Kneller, Sir Henry Raeburn, and others. It also houses important pieces of furniture, porcelain and other fine artefacts, many of which came from the now demolished Hamilton Palace in Lanarkshire. The collections include the Boulle cabinet given to the Duchess by King Charles II and a silver jewellery box that belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots, that purportedly held the Casket letters showing her complicity in the murder of Lord Darnley, together with her death mask. There is also the map and compass carried by Rudolf Hess, Adolf Hitler's deputy, who flew to Scotland in 1941 on a mission to involve the 14th Duke of Hamilton in helping negotiate peace between Britain and Germany. The very rare and important 17-piece Lennoxlove toilet service in silver-gilt can now be seen in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. It was discovered in its custom travelling-case in a tower room of the house shortly after it changed hands in 1900. It was made in Paris, almost certainly for Frances Teresa Stuart, Duchess of Richmond and Lennox (1647-1702). The pieces come from a number of different makers and years, and the service was assembled around 1672.The Lennoxlove service in the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh , Paris, 1652-72 References External links * Lennoxlove House official website * Lennoxlove Book Festival official website * Lennoxlove on the Gazetteer for Scotland * Gallery of artefacts from the Lennoxlove Collection Country houses in East Lothian Castles in East Lothian Tourist attractions in East Lothian Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes Literary festivals in Scotland Category A listed buildings in East Lothian Listed houses in Scotland Museums in East Lothian Art museums and galleries in Scotland Historic house museums in East Lothian * Tower houses in Scotland Hamilton's = official History website ","title":"Lennoxlove House"},{"id":"3529455","text":"Joseph T.

Prior to joining the U.S. Army, Angelo worked for the Du Pont Powderworks, and was later involved in the Bonus Army movement of the 1930s.\\" 'Bravest Man in the American Army' is Compliment Bestowed on New Jersey Boy by Tank Commander.\\" Indiana Evening Gazette, April 4, 1919. War service Angelo was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions during the Meuse-Argonne offensive on September 26, 1918, as the Colonel's orderly (batman) with 304th Tank Brigade, commanded by future General George S. Patton, Jr. During the battle, in an exposed position Patton was seriously wounded by a machine gun. Showing great courage under enemy fire, Angelo dragged Patton to safety. He had thus saved the life of a man who would one day become an American legend. In the spring of 1919, an interview appeared in American newspapers in which Patton declared Angelo \\"without doubt the bravest man in the American Army. I have never seen his equal.\\" According to the interviewer, Angelo began \\"blushing furiously\\" as he related the following details: Great Depression and Bonus Army In 1932, while Patton continued his path on his famous military career, Angelo had returned to civilian life. He was unemployed and suffering along with many other veterans from the effects of the Great Depression. As a result, he joined the Bonus Army movement of First World War veterans demanding monetary compensation for their roles in the war. The particular issue was that these veterans had been promised compensation but they were not due to receive it until 1948 (the money was eventually awarded in 1936). Given the realities of the depression, veterans such as Angelo demanded the money be paid immediately. The veterans marched on Washington D.C., setting up camps in order to protest against the administration of President Herbert Hoover. Last meeting On July 28, 1932, troops were ordered into the camps to quell the protest. In the resulting melee, two veterans were killed and many were injured. The commanders of the operation included Douglas MacArthur, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and Patton, the man saved by Angelo so many years before. In the aftermath of the assault on the camps, Angelo approached Patton, but was harshly rejected. The last known words between the men were uttered by Patton: \\"I do not know this man. Take him away and under no circumstances permit him to return.\\" He explained to his fellow officers that Angelo had \\"dragged me from a shell hole under fire. I got him a decoration for it. Since the war, my mother and I have more than supported him. We have given him money. We have set him up in business several times.

Background He was born into a middle-class Shia Muslim family originally from the United Provinces of India, where he was born in 1928. His older brother, Santosh Kumar, was also a film actor. Another brother, S. Sulaiman, is a film director. Career Darpan was introduced in the film Amanat in 1950 and went on to feature in the Pakistani Punjabi film Billo in 1951. After starring in a few more films produced in Lahore, he decided to try his luck in India, where he only had moderate level of success. Notable films from this period include Barati (1954), and Adl-e-Jehangir (1955) opposite Meena Kumari. While in India, he was romantically involved with the Indian actress Nigar Sultana, who played 'Bahar' in the classic Indian film Mughal-e-Azam (1960). Darpan came back to Lahore after a few years, where the film industry was then booming, and he acted in Baap Ka Gunah (1957). He had a breakthrough with his self- produced film Sathi. Raat Ke Rahi (1960), Saheli, Gulfam, Qaidi, Anchal, Baji, Shikwa, Ik Tera Sahara and Naela (1965) were some big films in which he played vital roles. Critics applauded his lead role performance back in Pakistan's film Saheli (1960) in which he starred alongside Nayyar Sultana and Shamim Ara. He won a Best Actor Nigar Award for his performance in Saheli (1960), as well as a Presidential award. His last big film as hero was Payal Ki Jhankar in 1966. He was the hero in two of Waheed Murad's produced films Insaan Badalta Hai and Jab Se Dekha Hai Tumhen. He played the villain in Ik Gunah Aur Sahi, and was a supporting actor in Khuda Te Maan, Jub Jub Phool Khile (1975) and a few other films. Family life Darpan was a good-looking and attractive man with hazel eyes and a rich playboy's smile. At first glance, he seemed like a non-serious flirt and a 'lady killer'. At least, that was his 'professional image as an actor'. He used to play non-serious fun-loving roles in the movies quite unlike his older actor brother Santosh Kumar who used to take serious romantic roles in the Pakistani movies of the 1950s and 1960s. When it came to marriage, Darpan fell for a shy, typically eastern and a lady- like fellow actress, Nayyar Sultana. They had been paired together earlier in a super-hit Pakistani film Saheli (1960) which also starred Shamim Ara and was directed by veteran film director S.M. Yousuf.

Composition  Liquid latex is usually made of 33% latex, 66% water, and less than 1% ammonia (to increase its shelf life and to control the pH of the solution). Liquid latex is sold in volumes ranging from 2 ounces to 1 gallon, and its consistency is similar to latex house paint. Cosmetic liquid latex contains approximately 0.3% ammonia, while craft and mould-making liquid latex can contain more than double this amount, giving the latter a much stronger odour. Liquid latex is naturally clear, and dries into a translucent amber colour. Manufacturers add pigments to the product to provide opaque paint choices of multiple colours. The colour of the paint in the jar may initially look chalky or pale, but as it dries, it develops into a rich colour (for example, grey becomes black). Acrylic paint can be mixed with liquid latex for custom colours, but may not be suitable for use in cosmetic applications. As the latex dries, it becomes quite sticky and will stick to itself if accidentally folded over. Most manufacturers offer a slick spray for latex once it is dry to remove tackiness, allowing the movement of the model's limbs. Alternatively, powders can be dusted over dried liquid latex to create metallic effects. One advantage to the tackiness of liquid latex is that it can act as an adhesive for attaching items such as zippers. Unlike most other body and face paints, liquid latex is removed by peeling it off, since water does not reactivate it.  Use  A four-ounce jar of liquid latex can typically cover an average human body. It is typically applied using a disposable sponge and takes about five to ten minutes to dry depending on how thick it is applied. As it dries, it solidifies to a rubbery consistency and in the process ends up shrinking by approximately 3%. Removing latex from skin can cause pain or pull body hairs out, similar to waxing. Even though latex is non-toxic, some people can have an allergic reaction to it. The most severe of these happen immediately and are categorised as an immediate hypersensitivity reaction. Fumes from the ammonia in liquid latex can irritate the eyes when it is used on the face. For this reason, it is recommended that liquid latex be allowed to vent for several minutes before being applied in this way. Appropriate liquid latex safety guidelines should be followed before the cosmetic use of liquid latex. Liquid latex used for special effects makeup projects like scars and gashes incorporate flesh-coloured latex that is applied to the skin and then built up using materials such as tissue paper and cotton.

The H.239 recommendation is titled \\"Role management and additional media channels for H.3xx-series terminals\\". Practical importance of this recommendation is its setting forth a way to have multiple video channels (e.g., one for conferencing, another for presentation) within a single session (call). History H.239 builds on the ITU-T's H.32x (which includes H.323) and H.245 series of standards, called \\"recommendations\\" by the ITU. Tandberg introduced the ability to send a computer or video presentation along with a video teleconference session in 2000 with their \\"DuoVideo\\" feature in February 2000.DagensIT: Verdens flotteste telefon. Feb 10 2000. PictureTel introduced People+Content in July 2000. Polycom then acquired PictureTel in May 2001 and began offering their proprietary, patented method to other vendors on a royalty-free basis in 2002. In Feb. 2003 the ITU-T took up a proposal by vendors to create a standard based on Tandberg and Polycom technology. The ITU-T published this technology as Recommendation H.239 in July 2003.  Overview  A traditional videoconference has an audio channel, a video channel and an optional data channel. The video channel typically carries the camera image of the participants. H.239 defines rules and messages for establishing an additional video/graphics channel, often to transmit a PC graphics presentation or video from a document camera, while still transmitting the video of the presenter. For presentations in multipoint conferencing, H.239 defines token procedures to guarantee that only one endpoint in the conference sends the additional video channel which is then distributed to all conference participants. The signaling for H.239 is defined in a way which simplifies implementation of gateways between H.323 and H.320. Procedure When an H.323 call is connected, signaling defined in H.245 is used to establish the set of capabilities for all connected endpoints and MCUs. When the set of capabilities includes an indication that H.239 presentations are supported, a connected endpoint can choose to open an additional video channel. First the endpoint has to request a token from the MCU. The MCU then will check if there is another endpoint currently sending an additional video channel. The MCU will use token messages to make this endpoint stop sending the additional video channel. Then the MCU will acknowledge the token request from the first endpoint which then can begin to send the additional video channel which e.g. contains encoded video from a computer's video output at XGA resolution. Similar procedures are defined for the case when two endpoints are directly connected to each other without an intermediate MCU.

He had also served as Prime Minister under Viranarasimha Raya. He belonged to a Telugu Niyogi Brahmin family. Timmarasa was responsible for the coronation of Krishnadevaraya. Records of Portuguese traveller Fernao Nuniz suggest that Vira Narasimha, while on his death bed, ordered Timmarasa to blind his half brother Krishnadevaraya to ensure that his own minor son of eight years would become king of the empire. Timmarasa instead presented the king with a pair of she-goat eyes in order to satisfy the wish of the dying king. This way Timmarasa ensured that Krishnadevaraya became the successor. However, K. A. N. Sastri believes that there is nothing to suggest anything but a friendly relationship between the two half-brothers. In 1524, Krishnadevaraya crowned his minor son Yuvaraja. A few months later the prince took ill and died of poisoning. Accusing Timmarusu for this crime, Krishnadevaraya had the entire family of the ministers blinded. It is said the King later released Timmarusu, on knowing that the conspiracy to kill his own son was hatched by Gajapathis of Orissa. The Gajapathis did not want their princess Jaganmohini to wed Krishadevaraya, as they believed he was not pure. The Gajapathis belonged to Suryavansha (Solar Dynasty) clan of Orissa. But had to agree to this marriage, owing to Krishnadevaraya's victory over Gajapathis. Krishanadevaraya's parents, Narasa Nayaka a chieftain from Dakshina Kannada and Nagaladevi a chieftain's daughter from Andhra, were not from the royal family of Vijayanagara (Sangama Dynasty). The king deplored and repented with Timmarusu, later on. On being released, Timmarusu spent the rest of his life in Tirupati. He refused to take any support from his former King. He died a death in poverty. His Samadhi is in Penukonda, Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh.

A submission is a combat sports term for yielding to the opponent, and hence resulting in an immediate defeat. The submission ‚Äì then also referred to as a \\"tap out\\" or \\"tapping out\\" ‚Äì is often performed by visibly tapping the floor or the opponent with the hand or in some cases with the foot, or by saying the word 'tap' to signal the opponent and/or the referee of the submission. In some combative sports where the fighter has cornermen, the cornerman can also stop the fight by \\"throwing in the towel\\" (usually by literally throwing a towel into the ring), which may count as a submission. Technical submission A technical submission may occur when the referee or doctor stops the fight because a fighter has sustained an injury or is rendered unconscious while in a submission hold. An example would be a fighter's arm breaking in an armbar, or a fighter passing out in a choke hold. In both cases the fighter is unable to tap out, and an official decides that the fighter cannot safely continue to fight. Such a match outcome may be called a technical submission or a technical knockout (TKO) depending on the rules of combat used for the match.

It is used both melodically and rhythmically, for example as a door knock. \\"Two bits\\" is an archaism in the United States for 25 cents; a quarter. \\"Six bits\\" is occasionally used. The final words may also be \\"get lost\\", \\"drop dead\\" (in Australia), or some other facetious expression. In England, it was often said as \\"five bob\\" (slang for five shillings), although words are now rarely used to accompany the rhythm or the tune. History An early occurrence of the tune is from an 1899 Charles Hale song, \\"At a Darktown Cakewalk\\".Much of this article is taken from James Fuld, The Book of World- Famous Music: Classical, Popular, and Folk. 5th ed., revised and enlarged (New York: Dover Publications, 2000), p. 495. Other songs from the same period also used the tune. The same notes form the bridge in the \\"Hot Scotch Rag\\", written by H. A. Fischler in 1911. An early recording used the 7-note tune at both the beginning and the ending of a humorous 1915 song, by Billy Murray and the American Quartet, called \\"On the 5:15\\". In his 1933 novel, Hizzoner the Mayor, Joel Sayre wrote of boats \\"tooting the official Malta welcome blast to the tempo of 'Shave-and-a-haircut-two-bits, shave-and-a-haircut-two-bits, shave- and-a-haircut-two-bits', which was soon taken up by every craft in the harbor that had a boiler\\", indicating that the tune was already associated by that time with the lyric. In 1939, Dan Shapiro, Lestor Lee and Milton Berle released \\"Shave and a Haircut ‚Äì Shampoo\\",\\"Catchy Tune Central \\", Members.MultiMania.NL. which used the tune in the closing bars. In the same year, Rosalind Rosenthal and Herbert Halpert recorded \\"Shave and a Haircut, Bay Rum\\". Popularity The tune can be heard on customized car horns, while the rhythm may be tapped as a door knockPartridge, Eric; Dalzell, Tom; and Victor, Terry (2007).

The former prisoner of war and U.S. Navy seaman Doug Hegdahl reports fellow U.S. captives in the Vietnam War would authenticate a new prisoner's U.S. identity by using \\"Shave and a Haircut\\" as a shibboleth, tapping the first five notes against a cell wall and waiting for the appropriate response. U.S. POWs were then able to communicate securely with one another via the quadratic alphabet code. The tune has been used innumerable times as a coda or ending in musical pieces. It is strongly associated with the stringed instruments of bluegrass music, particularly the 5-string banjo. Earl Scruggs often ended a song with this phrase or a variation of it. On the television show The Beverly Hillbillies, musical cues signifying the coming of a commercial break (cues which were in bluegrass style) frequently ended with \\"Shave and a Haircut\\". It is the most popular bluegrass run, after the G run. \\"Shave and a Haircut\\" was used in many early cartoons, particularly Looney Tunes cartoons, played on things varying from car horns to window shutters banging in the wind. It was also used as an ending to many cartoon shows, just after the credits. Decades later, the couplet became a plot device to lure-out an intended victim, as used by the chief antagonist Judge Doom in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the idea being that toons cannot resist finishing with the \\"two bits\\" when they hear the opening rhythm.  Recordings  The phrase has been incorporated into countless recordings and performances. Notable examples include: * \\"That's a Lot of Bunk\\", a 1920s novelty song composed by Al Wilson, James A. Brennan and Mack Henshaw, and performed by Billy Jones and Ernest Hare, known as \\"The Happiness Boys\\", closes with the riff. * The Crazy Gang sang \\"How's your father?

Uses in other countries  In Mexico, the melody is highly offensive, as it is commonly used to stand in for the rhythmically similar vulgar phrase \\"chinga tu madre, cabr√≥n\\" (English: \\"Go fuck your mother, asshole!\\"). The Italian version is Ammazza la vecchia...col Flit! (English: \\"Kill the old lady...with Flit!\\")‚ÄîFlit being an old brand of DDT insecticide. This is a humorous popular version of a post-World War II commercial Ammazza la mosca... col Flit (English: \\"Kill the fly with Flit!\\"). This version is never perceived as offensive, but just as a joke. The tune is used in Catalan with a different lyric: \\"Nas de barraca. Sant Boi\\" (English: \\"Shack nose. Sant Boi\\"). It is also tapped, as a door knock. The Catalan lyrics may come from Blanes, where it was sung twice with Nas de barraca. Sant Boi. Cinc de carmelos pel noi (English: Shack nose. Sant Boi. Five candies for the boy). In Spain, it is sung with the lyrics, Una copita... de Oj√©n (English: \\"A shot of schnapps\\"). In Irish barroom music, the tune is sometimes tagged at the end of a song. The performer sings the first part to the lyrics, \\"How is your aul' one?\\" (read: \\"old one,\\" a slang term for mother), to which the audience replies, \\"Gameball!\\" (A slang term meaning A-OK). In Sweden it is well known as Kvart √∂ver elva... halv tolv, which means A quarter past eleven... half past eleven. The twist doesn't work as well in English, as the English time system treats 11:30 as a continuation of eleven instead of as the first half of twelve. Halv tolv thus means half twelve and is the correct Swedish equivalent of half past eleven. In Sweden, the melody was also used in a commercial for the Bronzol brand of candy with the slogan H√§lsan f√∂r halsen‚ÄîBronzol (English: Health for your throat‚ÄîBronzol). In Icelandic the lyrics are Saltkj√∂t og baunir... t√∫kall (English: \\"Salt meat and split peas... two krona\\" (kr√≥na is the currency in Iceland)). In the Netherlands, the phrase is used when someone leaves with the intention to not return. Die zien we nooit meer, te-rug (English: We shall never see them, a-gain). It is used as a way to make fun of someone/something, if it suddenly disappears from the scene. In Argentina, Carlos Bal√°, a former children's TV programmes host, used to include a bit in his routine in which he would hum the \\"shave and a haircut\\" part of the tune, prompting the children in the audience to answer \\"Ba-l√°\\" to the rhythm of the two final notes.

He was later bought out on 1 July 1881 by Mr. James Dellow, who became the local blacksmith. But it was only in mid-1889 that a post office with telegraph office and bureau was opened. The Mayfield post Office was in use from this time until it was downgraded to a volunteer Post office in 1982. Several local ladies held the position of volunteer Postmistress thereafter until the postal services were shifted to the local store. If any one person could be considered to have founded Mayfield then it was almost certainly James Dellow. It was he who essentially invented the heavier, more robust farming gear needed when it became quite clear that the lightweight harrows and plows previously used could not handle the stony conditions and it was he who lived to see Mayfield grown from one or two houses to a functioning, prosperous settlement.

Education Mayfield is the location of a primary school that services the township and surrounding community. The school was opened sometime between 1880 and 1887. In 2000 the school was increased in size when the smaller Lismore and Westerfield schools were closed. Students at these schools transferred to Mayfield. Two relocatable classrooms from Lismore were moved to Mayfield to add two additional classrooms while another building was used to extend the library/hall. Mayfield School is a decile 9 co-educational state full primary school (U2 grade) catering for New Entrants to Year 8 students. At the end of 2010 the roll was 71 students. Secondary education is undertaken at Geraldine High School or Ashburton College, with school buses running from Mayfield to both schools. Water Supply Mayfield has as reticulated water supply providing water to approximately 60 properties in the village. The water supply was originally provided from stock water by the council. In April 2009 when the council reviewed proposals to upgrade the stock water based supply to meet new standards an alternative proposal was made by the local community to source water from a bore. The community raised funding and paid for the drilling of a well in the village and the supply was switched to the bore. Subsequently, the supply was found to be insufficient to meet demand. Properties on the Mayfield articulated water supply have suffered from a limited water supply and as of October 2016 have been placed on Level 4 water restrictions prohibiting the use of outdoor hosepipes. In May 2016 a trial project to roll out water meters was announced by the Ashburton District Council. The District Council has sourced a portable filtration system that would use stock water as a contingency.

Eskov graduated from the Department of Biology of Moscow State University in 1979. In 1986 he defended a dissertation for the Candidate of Biological Sciences at the A.N. Severtsov Institute of Animal Evolutionary Morphology and Ecology of the USSR Academy of Sciences, the theme being \\"Spiders of Northern Siberia (horology analysis)\\". His main scientific interests as a biologist focus on the spiders of Siberia and the Russian Far East and, as a paleontologist, on the Paleozoic and Cenozoic eras. he is the Senior Researcher at the Laboratory of Arthropods of the Paleontological Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences and vice-president of the Eurasian Arachnological Society. He has worked at the institute since 1988. he had 86 scientific publications. Eskov has discovered several new genera of spiders. Among seven discovered by him in 1988 is Kikimora palustris Eskov, 1988World Spider Catalog - Linyphiidae It belongs to the family Linyphiidae, and is found in Russia and Finland. The name translates from Latin as \\"marsh Kikimora\\". (Kikimora is a female spirit in Slavic mythology and the Russian phrase –∫–∏–∫–∏–º–æ—Ä–∞ –±–æ–ª–æ—Ç–Ω–∞—è (\\"marsh kikimora\\") is well known in the Russian language.)

If constructed, the dam could generate 3,600 MW of electricity. It is also suggested and promoted as a potential solution to the chronic flooding problem and the related water crises in the country. Over the decades, the understanding of the environmental impacts of mega dam projects have grown, and Pakistan Economy Watch has demanded a national debate on the KBD issue. History After the construction of Tarbela Dam, Kalabagh became the highest priority dam project. In 1979, the government obtained a grant of $25 million from the UNDP for its preparation, detailed design and feasibility. Pakistan first approached the Soviet Union for financing assistance, but due to strained relations with Afghanistan (a Soviet ally), this request was denied. The government then approached the World Bank, which agreed to finance the project. At this point in Pakistan's history, previous dam projects such as Mangla (under Ayub Khan) and Tarbela (under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto) never faced any opposition. Even Kalabagh was approved by the Central Development Working Party, without dissent. The issue of Kalabagh started to become politicized after the execution of the former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a highly popular leader from the downstream province of Sindh. Adding to the controversy, was the feud between Zia-ul-Haq and his own NWFP governor Fazle Haq, which eventually dragged in the Awami National Party into the opposing camp. Due to certain violations of the Indus Accord by the Punjab province, reservations in Sindh grew against the project, whose population and political leaders now painted it as a conspiracy. Despite the political roadblocks, the World Bank and foreign consultants continued their work on Kalabagh, over a period of ten years, up to 1986 when the project was finally put on hold. The suspicions of the Sindhis grew after Benazir Bhutto's government was dismissed in favor of Nawaz Sharif (from Punjab.) There is debate on whether Benazir favored the Kalabagh project. Pir Pagar has claimed the dam was originally conceived by her father, and that Benazir had allocated funds for it. Others like Sharjeel Memon have claimed Benazir was against its construction. In December 2004, Pervez Musharraf announced that he would re-initiate the Kalabagh project to serve the larger interest of Pakistan. However, on 26 May 2008, the Federal Minister for Water and Power of Pakistan, Raja Pervez Ashraf, said that the \\"Kalabagh Dam would not be constructed\\" and that the project had been cancelled due to \\"opposition from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh and other stakeholders, the project was no longer feasible\\".Kalabagh Dam shelved forever . Nation.com.pk (27 May 2008). Retrieved 6 June 2012. In 2010 after the worst floods in Pakistani history, the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Yousaf Raza Gilani, stated flood damage would be minimised if the Kalabagh Dam were built.Leading News Resource of Pakistan. Daily Times (10 August 2010). Retrieved 6 June 2012. KIRC, an NGO focusing on coverage of the Kashmir conflict has alleged that the opposition against the construction of Kalabagh has been supported by foreign intelligence agencies, as a way to weaken the state of Pakistan.. Kashmir Watch (26 September 2018). Retrieved 29 September 2018. Arguments Supporting Construction A study funded by NUST University in 2014, concluded that building Kalabagh would offer the following benefits: (1) Annual savings of $4 billion in energy costs (2) Saving Rs. 132 billion due to irrigation benefits and (3) Prevent flood-loss damage, such as the $45 billion loss suffered in recent floods at the time the study was published. The study estimated that the overall benefits of Kalabagh would provide Rs. 20 billion every year, and thus the cost of construction would be repaid within 8‚Äì9 years. Moreover, according to the study, the negative consequences of not building Kalabagh are as follows: (1) Economic destabilization due to food shortage, (2) \\"Serious drop\\" in agricultural production, (3) Rise in inter- provincial disputes over water, (4) Additional cost of importing energy, (5) Prohibitive cost of electricity for the average consumer and (6) Effects on industry and agriculture due to rising electricity costs. Bashir A. Malik, former chief technical advisor to the United Nations and World Bank, said, \\"Sindh and Pakhtunkhwah would become drought areas in the years to come if Kalabagh Dam was not built.\\" At the same time, former KP Chief Minister Shamsul Mulk has stated that the \\"Kalabagh Dam would be helpful in erasing poverty from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, as it would irrigate 800,000 acres of cultivable land that is located 100‚Äì150 feet above the level of River Indus.\\" The Kalabagh Dam would provide 6.5 million acre feet of water to cultivate seven million acres of currently barren land in addition to the of electricity it would provide. In response to the push towards side-lining Kalabagh altogether in favour of the rival Basha Dam project, Engineer Anwer Khurshid stated that \\"Basha Dam is no substitute for Kalabagh Dam, not because of its altitude, which is high enough, but because no irrigation canals can be taken out from it because of the hilly terrain.\\" Experts who supported the construction of the Kalabagh Dam at the 2012 \\"Save Water Save Pakistan\\" Forum included: Dr Salman Shah, former Finance Minister of Pakistan; Abdul Majeed Khan, TECH Society president; Shafqat Masood, former IRSA chairman; Qayyum Nizami, former Minister of State; Prof Abdul Qayyum Qureshi, former Vice- Chancellor of Islamia University, Bahawalpur; Dr Muhammad Sadiq, agricultural scientist; M Saeed Khan, former GM of Kalabagh Dam Project; Engr. Mahmudur Rehman Chughtai, Mansoor Ahmed, former MD of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission Foundation, M. Zubair Sheikh and Jameel Gishkori, among others. The participants of Save Water Save Pakistan demanded the construction of five dams, including the Munda Dam, Kurram Tangi Dam, Akhori Dam and the Kalabagh Dam, at by 2025 at the latest to store water and generate electricity to meet demand. Initially when the project was being conceived, engineering studies conducted by an independent Panel of Experts were also constituted by the World Bank, to progressively review the consultants work and to advise them. Members of this panel were eminent world experts and were drawn from different countries. Additional specialists were invited for giving their views on selected topics, where needed. An independent review panel was also constituted by the Government of Pakistan, consisting of eminent Pakistani engineers to review the Project Planning Report. Among them were Engr. Manzoor Ahmed Sheikh, Engr. Asghar Ali Abidi and Engr. Shah Nawaz Khan. This panel also agreed with the conclusions of the Report and supported its recommendations. Opposition to Kalabagh  Kalabagh dam is opposed by major political parties of Sindh and Kyber Pakhtunkhwah such as ANP, JUI(F) and PPP. The government from time to time tries to form a consensus on the issue. The former leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah showed objection to the site of Kalabagh Dam and said it is a threat to small provinces. The former Chief Minister of KPK Pervez Khattak said that the KBD is against the interests of KP. Awami National Party has opposed the construction and site of KBD. Sustainable Development Policy Institute, an NGO, published a case study on Kalabagh dam in 1999, mainly arguing against the environmental and displacement impact of building large dams.https://www.sdpi.org/publications/files/W48-The%20Case%20Against%20Kalabagh%20Dam.pdf Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) former chief Altaf Hussain conditionally supported the Kalabagh dam and said that government should address the reservations of Sindhis before its constructionhttp://pu.edu.pk/images/journal/csas/PDF/1_V28_1_2013.pdf See also *List of power stations in Pakistan *Indus Waters Treaty *Katzarah Dam References External links * Sheikhupura Chamber of Commerce: The Behavior of some Towards National Problems by Muzaffar Hameed, June 2010 * Dawn news: Kalabagh: the other view, Published 16 December 2012 * The KalaBagh Controversy by Dr. Shaheen Rafi Khan * Kalabagh Dam: An ecological Disaster by Abrar Kazi * Kalabagh Dam (Mianwali News) Dam controversies Mianwali District Dams in Pakistan Hydroelectric power stations in Pakistan Controversies in Pakistan Provincial disputes in Pakistan Proposed dams Proposed hydroelectric power stations Dams on the Indus River Conspiracy theories in Pakistan Kalabagh ","title":"Kalabagh Dam"},{"id":"3529609","text":"David Rumsey at the 2005 Where 2.0 Conference.

Pre-political life He was born in Carbost on the Isle of Skye, Scotland in 1803 to Ronald Stewart and Isabella McLeod. He came to Glengarry County in Upper Canada, shortly after landing in Quebec, with his family of 9 siblings, recently widowed mother, grandmother, and uncle. He moved to Bytown, later Ottawa, in 1827, where he opened a store and tavern. He was elected to the first town council in 1828. He helped found the Carleton General Protestant Hospital, later the Ottawa Civic Hospital, and then the Wallis House. A number of streets in Ottawa's Centretown that were on land originally owned by members of the Stewart family, south of the built up area of the city are, or were named for his family members. Catherine street was named for his wife, Catherine Stewart. James and McLeod Streets for his sons, and Flora, Isabella, Florence, and Ann streets were named for his daughters. Ann street was later renamed Gladstone for the British Prime Minister. Stewart street in Sandy Hill was not named for him, as that name predates him. During the 1830s, he was part of the Ottawa River timber trade and was a founding member of the Ottawa Lumber Association. He sold land in the Sandy Hill area of the town on behalf of Louis-Th√©odore Besserer. Stewart also operated a large farm along the Rideau River. Political career In 1841, he ran against Stewart Derbishire, the candidate sponsored by Governor Lord Sydenham, to represent Bytown in the Legislative Assembly. Sydenham had persuaded all other candidates to withdraw. In 1843, he was elected to represent Russell in a by-election and he represented Bytown in the 2nd Parliament of the Province of Canada from 1844 to 1847. He proposed a canal linking the Ottawa River to Georgian Bay and drafted the bill incorporating Bytown. He was a member of the Bytown board of trade and a director for the Bank of British North America. He was a founding member of St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Ottawa. His son, McLeod Stewart, was mayor of Ottawa from 1887 to 1888. His brother Neil also served in the assembly for the Province of Canada. Death He became ill and died in Toronto in 1856 while representing the city of Ottawa there. His close political associate, Robert Bell (Ottawa politician), was with him at his bedside before his death.

It is also the only Catholic day and boarding college for boys in New Zealand's South Island. Students at St Bede's are colloquially known as Bedeans. St Bede's College was founded in 1911 by the Marists, a religious congregation founded in Lyon, France in 1816. The current rector of the college, Mr Justin Boyle, was appointed in 2002. He was previously the first lay principal of St. Kevin's College, Oamaru but left at the end of 2001 to become the first lay rector of St Bede's.In 2018 Boyle was criticised by Dr Murray Heasley, a spokesman for the Network of Survivors of Abuse in Faith-based Institutions and their Supporters, following his failure to dismiss a teacher who had admitted to a historic case of sexual abuse against a 13-year-old boy. St. Bede The college bears the name of The Venerable Bede (AD 673‚Äì735) an English Benedictine Monk, Scholar, and Saint. Widely regarded as the Father of English History, Bede is most famous for his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, recognized as the first ecclesiastical history of Britain. During his time, Bede was regarded as the finest scholar in Europe. His shrine is at Jarrow, England. Philosophy and Marist Tradition The college is renowned for its high academic standards, proud sporting heritage and the distinctive educational philosophy of the Marist tradition. From its beginnings, St. Bede's College has taught its students by observing a tradition that combines Marian and apostolic elements. For the most part of the previous century, the college had residential Marist priests and brothers as teaching staff. There is still a significant Marist presence at the college. The college's mission is To help each boy develop fully by Faith and by Works. History The Society of Mary (Marists) is a religious congregation founded in 1816 in Lyon, France at the time of the French Revolution by Father Jean-Claude Colin (1790‚Äì1875) and twelve colleagues, including Marcellin Joseph Beno√Æt Champagnat, future Founder of the Marist Brothers, and Father (later Bishop) Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pompallier, first bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in New Zealand. The canonical approbation of the Society of Mary was given by Pope Gregory XVI in 1836. Fr Jean-Claude Colin had a close association with Pompallier who accompanied the French Marist Missionaries to New Zealand. The Society of Mary became involved in missionary work and teaching, work that was very similar to the missions of the Jesuits, but which had a distinctive Marian approach. Before 1877, education in New Zealand was a provincial jurisdiction, with many schools being established by churches or private funding. With the Education Act 1877, the New Zealand Government centralised control through twelve regional education boards to introduce free, compulsory and secular education. Schools intending to teach religious instruction could not receive Government assistance. The Society of Mary continued to build the foundations for a Catholic System of Education, sourcing religious teachers from Ireland, Europe and Australia. In 1885, the Society of Mary established St. Patrick's College in Cambridge Terrace, Wellington. St. Patrick's College was the first Society of Mary secondary school for Boys in New Zealand. St. Bede's College, Christchurch, was established in 1911 at the request of Bishop John Joseph Grimes S.M., and the first Catholic Bishop of Christchurch. The Society owned St. Bede's College. The school was originally located along Ferry Road, but it outgrew its facilities. The college had the option of purchasing the current site or that of St. Andrew's College, Christchurch in Merivale. Some say that the choice made was a fine decision because due to the land being cheaper, the college was able to build magnificent stone buildings to accommodate the monks and to accommodate lessons. The chapel was originally used as a gym, but with the building of Chanel Hall, it became obsolete and so was converted to a chapel. The chapel contains the Board of Honour, honouring Bedeans who fought and died for their country in both world wars. The college was moved in 1920 to its present site on 220,000 square meters of fields and trees at the northern entrance to the city. The original buildings of St. Bede's were magnificent in old design, but most of them had to be demolished in 1981 due to new earthquake safety requirements. However, the chapel and half of Durham remain standing. Over the years, buildings have continued to be added to the college, including the Alistair Macdonald Centre for the Performing Arts, Jarrow (a senior boarding dorm) as well as a new gymnasium. The chapel is described as the heart of the school. In addition to the surface buildings, the school has a number of tunnels and bomb shelters under the school, built for evacuation purposes. In 2009, the Society of Mary (Marists) in New Zealand accepted a complaint that one of its priests, a former teacher at St Bede's College (in 1939), Francis Durning, had sexually abused children. The house system A house system was instituted at St. Bede's College, with every student allocated to a house. The house system has several functions, including administrative. Each house is named for a distinguished person associated with the college and its name. There are five houses. These are: * Benedict, gold house, named for St. Benedict, Founder of the Benedictine Order at Monte Cassino of which Bede was a member. Benedict has won the house points shield (Burger Shield) from 2003‚Äì2011. Renowned for the motto, \\"pure gold\\". * Colin, light blue house, named for The Venerable Jean-Claude Colin, S.M. was a French priest, founder of the Society of Mary in Lyon, France. * McCarthy, green house, named for Major, Rt. Hon. Sir Thaddeus McCarthy, Alumnus, Jurist and the college's first Knight. * Mannix, dark blue house, named for Fr. John Mannix, SM, Seventh Rector of the college and first Old Boy to become Rector. * Redwood, maroon house (often uses Red), named for Francis M. Redwood, SM, Archbishop of Wellington, who successfully sourced teaching religious institutes from France, Ireland, and Australia, after the passage of the Education Act, 1877. He also served on the Senate of the University of New Zealand for more than 25 years. Boarding houses The boarding houses are for boarding pupils and are located on the college grounds. These are: * Grimes, named for John Joseph Grimes, SM, the first Roman Catholic Bishop of Christchurch (1888). Bishop Grimes oversaw the completion of construction in 1905 of the Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, designed by Francis Petre. The Grimes building sustained damage in the Canterbury earthquake, and was therefore demolished. * Jarrow, named for the English town of Jarrow, on the River Tyne, and the Monastery where St. Bede spent most of his life. * Durham, named for Durham Cathedral, England, where the remains of St. Bede were entombed after being taken from Jarrow circa 1020. * Wearmouth, The Wearmouth boarding wing for Year 13 boarders was opened during the first week in August 2010. This wonderful facility was designed by architect Duval O‚ÄôNeill and built by Matthew Bushnell. Notable alumni St. Bede's College Old Boys are notably represented in the New Zealand Parliament in the House of Representatives. They accounted for the greatest number of alumni of any New Zealand College to sit in the Legislature of New Zealand's 47th, 48th, 49th, 50th and 51st New Zealand Parliaments.

Four Bishops of Christchurch (Brian Ashby, Basil Meeking, John Cunneen and Barry Jones) and more than 180 priests attended St Bede's. Associations St. Bede's retains a special tradition of academic, cultural and sporting fixtures with St. Patrick's College, Wellington and St. Patrick's College, Silverstream. St Bede's played St Pat's Town in rugby from the 1920s until the early 1970s when it was dropped due to financial reasons. This was for the Holley Shield and the series between the two colleges stood at St Bede's 24, St Pat's Town 20, with one draw. The game against Silverstream had not been played since the Second World War until it was revived in the 1990s. Today, all three Colleges are part of the legacy of the Society of Mary in New Zealand. Effects from Canterbury quakes As a result of the severe 2011 Canterbury earthquake on 22 February, the school was fortunately spared, although the school was shut until 14 March to undergo building inspections. Sister school Marian College in Shirley, Christchurch was not so fortunate, being severely damaged.Marian College damaged Marian College is an all-girls school, and it was decided to share facilities with St. Bedes. The boys from St. Bedes attended school using a \\"morning timetable\\" up until 13:00, with the girls continuing on in the afternoon and evening.St. Bedes to share with Marian College The celebration of the 100th anniversary of St. Bedes College, due to take place at the end of May 2011, was also postponed as a result of the earthquake until a year later in May 2012. The Grimes boarding house was found unsafe due to quake damage resulting in the relocation of year ten and twelve students to the Durham boarding house. Grimes was demolished in early 2013 along with the Chapel of St Bede, previously the only original building on the site. The Chanel hall was demolished at the end of 2013. Currently, plans for a replacement hall are unknown, and the school is using the gym for Masses, liturgies and assemblies.

Life He was elder son of Count Eberhard III and Antonia Visconti. On 13 November 1397 he became engaged to Henriette of M√∂mpelgard. Henriette was the oldest daughter and main heiress of Henry of M√∂mpelgard, who died in 1396 one year before his father, Count Stephan of M√∂mpelgard. Their marriage, which occurred in 1407 at the latest, caused the county of M√∂mpelgard to become part of W√ºrttemberg. Eberhard IV also had a child with Agnes von Dagersheim. Eberhard IV took active part in management of the state from 1407. Starting 1409 he governed the county of M√∂mpelgard together with Henriette. After the death of Eberhard III on 16 May 1417, he became the ruler of all of W√ºrttemberg. At the time of his death on 2 July 1419, Eberhard's two sons, Louis, who would later become Count Louis I, and Ulrich, later Count Ulrich V, were only seven and six years old, respectively.

It has also previously been named both \\"Snowdon\\" and \\"South Snowdon\\". \\"Rhyd Ddu\\" is Welsh for \\"Black Ford\\". A station for Snowdon In the late 1880s, the construction of a railway up Snowdon from Llanberis was being seriously discussed. The NWNGR company renamed the station \\"Snowdon\\" as part of an effort to promote tourist traffic on their railway, especially amongst those who wanted to climb Wales' highest mountain. Some in Llanberis thought this misleading, but as contemporary literature pointed out - Visitors were by now alighting at this halt in droves, and nearby Beddgelert consequently received many more visitors. Horse-drawn road vehicles provided the link to Beddgelert, the connections being included in the railway's timetable. It was largely as a consequence of this that in 1893 a deputation of interested parties from Llanberis went to see landowner Mr Assheton-Smith, of the Vaenol Estate, who had previously been opposed to any railway up Snowdon, to try and convince him that Beddgelert was fast displacing Llanberis as the main centre for ascending the mountain. Assheton-Smith was ultimately convinced, and The Snowdon Mountain Tramroad and Hotels Co. Ltd. was established in November the following year. Prior to the line's subsequent take-over by the Welsh Highland Railway, a report by Major Spring, commissioned by the Festiniog Railway, referred to \\"Rhyddu [sic] or Snowdon Station\\". After take-over, the line was extended southwards to Beddgelert and Porthmadog in 1923. The station name was first renamed to \\"South Snowdon\\" and renamed again in 1934 to Rhyd- Ddu.http://www.rchs.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ChronSupplement2.pdf Closure Passenger services ceased to the old station site on 26 September 1936. 2003 re-opening Following reconstruction, the section from Waunfawr to Rhyd Ddu was formally reopened by the Prince of Wales on 30 July 2003. Prince Charles travelled from Waunfawr to Snowdon Ranger in the replica of a North Wales Narrow Gauge Railways coach, and from there to Rhyd Ddu on the footplate of the Ffestiniog Railway locomotive \\"Prince\\", built in 1863, which hauled the special train. Public passenger services commenced on 18 August 2003 and the station was reopened to passengers on 18 August 2003 on a new site slightly to the east (the car park occupies the original site) following the complete reconstruction of the railway from Waunfawr to Rhyd Ddu. An honoured guest that day was Mr Richard Williams of Beddgelert who had travelled on the first train in 1923. Train services are now operated by the Festiniog Railway Company's Welsh Highland Railway subsidiary. Facilities Rhyd Ddu station is the starting point of the 'Rhyd Ddu' footpath to the summit of Snowdon. There are public toilets and a car park adjoining the station. The Snowdonia Sherpa bus service to Beddgelert and Porthmadog or Pen- y-Pass calls at the station. Welsh Highland Railway Phase 4 and 2006 reconstruction Work on Phase 4, the long final section of the Welsh Highland Railway from Rhyd Ddu to Porthmadog, started at Rhyd Ddu in 2005. In February and March, 2006, the station underwent a large extension to allow through running trains to Porthmadog. This included two water towers for trains running in both directions, a \\"Rhyd Ddu Yard\\" with two sidings, one capable of stabling a train, and building a new southerly extension to the platform that extends it to the 200 m standard length platform of this route. There is also a waiting shelter and occasional ticket office. Trackwork modifications were completed to permit right-hand running (normal WHR and FR practice) into and through the station. Unfortunately, for the 2006 reopening of the station on 8 April, the trackwork for the Up loop had not been consolidated sufficiently to allow carriages to use the Porthmadog bound platform, due to a mechanical failure of the tamper. For the period between the reopening and 1 June 2006, when right hand running commenced, temporary operating instructions were in place whilst trains continued to run into the left hand line.

The unit's heritage dates back to 1944 as an air commando unit. The 352nd Wing serves as the focal point for all U.S. Air Force special operations activities throughout the European theater for U.S. European Command (USEUCOM), as well as Africa for U.S. Africa Command (USAFRICOM) and Southwest Asia and the Middle East for U.S. Central Command. The wing is prepared to conduct a variety of high priority, low-visibility missions supporting U.S. and allied special operations forces during peacetime, joint operations exercises, and combat operations. It trains and performs special operations primarily in the USEUCOM and USAFRICOM area of operations, including establishing air assault landing zones, controlling close air support by strike aircraft and gunships, and providing trauma care for wounded and injured personnel. The group's origins date to 1944 as the 2nd Air Commando Group. The unit was assigned to Tenth Air Force in India, whose elements operated in Burma flying a mixture of fighters, bombers, transports, military gliders and small planes performing operations behind the Japanese lines, and providing close air support for the British Fourteenth Army in the Burma Campaign. Units It is made up of the: * 352nd Special Operations Wing, RAF Mildenhall ** 752nd Special Operations Group *** 7th Special Operations Squadron, with CV-22B Osprey tilt rotor aircraft *** 67th Special Operations Squadron, with MC-130J Commando II aircraft *** 321st Special Tactics Squadron *** 352nd Special Operations Support Squadron ** 352nd Special Operations Maintenance Group *** 352nd Special Operations Maintenance Squadron *** 352nd Special Operations Aircraft Maintenance Squadron *** Joint Special Operations Air Component ‚Äì Europe (JSOAC-E) History The group's lineage and honors have to be traced not just through its own history, but through the history of three earlier organizations, the 2nd Air Commando Group (1944‚Äì1945); the 702nd Strategic Missile Wing (ICBM-Snark) (1959‚Äì1961) and the 39th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery (later Special Operations) Wing (1969‚Äì1992). =World War II= The Air Commando Groups were born out of a simple need. That was to support via light airplanes the evacuation and resupply requirements of British long range penetration groups, or Chindits, as they were affectionately called. Carrying the lethal firepower of both bombers and fighters combined with the logistical tentacles of a gamut of transports, gliders, and light aircraft, this organization would reach deep behind enemy lines to do battle. Formed as the 2nd Air Commando Group at Lakeland Army Airfield, Florida on 22 April 1944 and sent to India under Colonel Arthur R. DeBolt. The group trained for operations with North American O-47s, North American P-51 Mustangs, Douglas C-47 Skytrains and Stinson L-5 Sentinel aircraft as part of Third Air Force and in addition to operations at Lakeland, also trained at the Army Air Force School of Applied Tactics at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida. The 2nd Air Commando Group moved to India during October‚ÄìDecember 1944 where it was assigned to Tenth Air Force, the troop carrier squadron flying their C-47s to India, arriving by late October; a group advanced echelon arriving in mid-November; and the majority of the group arriving in mid-December. The unit then served in the China-Burma-India Theater of operations, with the fighter units flying missions over Bangkok, Thailand. Between November 1944 and May 1945 the group dropped supplies to Allied troops who were fighting the Japanese in the Chindwin Valley in Burma; moved Chinese troops from Burma to China; transported men, food, ammunition, and construction equipment to Burma; dropped Gurka paratroops during the assault on Rangoon; provided fighter support for Allied forces crossing the Irrawaddy River in February 1945; struck enemy airfields and transportation facilities; escorted bombers to targets in the vicinity of Rangoon; bombed targets in Thailand; and flew reconnaissance missions. After May 1945 the fighter squadrons were in training, and in June the group's C-47s were sent to Ledo to move road-building equipment. During June‚ÄîJuly, most of its L-5s were turned over to Fourteenth Air Force. Following the collapse of the Japanese in Burma, the 2nd Air Commando Group was sent to Okinawa to prepare for the Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, but the war ended. The unit was sent to the United States beginning in October 1945 and disbanded on 12 November 1945.Yancey, p.6 =Cold War= 702nd Strategic Missile Wing The 702nd Strategic Missile Wing was established in July 1958 at Presque Isle Air Force Base, Maine as the only SM-62 Snark missile wing in the USAF. In April, the wing was assigned the 556th Strategic Missile Squadron, which performed intercontinental missile test operations from Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, through June 1959. In July, the 556th moved to Presque Isle, where it was inactivated.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 658 Test operations from the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, were resumed by a wing detachment c. December 1959, continuing until the wing was inactivated.SAC Missile Chronology, p. 22 On 27 May 1959, the wing received its first operational missile at Presque Isle. Ten months later, on 18 March 1960, the first Snark missile went on alert status.Narducci, p. 4 Thirty are known to have been deployed. The 702nd was not declared fully operational until 28 February 1961. Exactly one month later, in March 1961, President John F. Kennedy declared the Snark \\"obsolete and of marginal military value\\"SAC Missile Chronology, p. 29 and on 25 June 1961 the 702nd was inactivated. The 702nd Wing and 2nd Group were consolidated as the 352nd Special Operations Wing in July 1985, but remained inactive, redesignating as the 352nd Special Operations Group in September 1992 and activating in December of the same year. In August 1998, the 352nd consolidated with the 39th Special Operations Wing. 39th Special Operations Wing The 39th was originally established as the 39th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Wing in 1969 as an Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service unit under Military Airlift Command, to include rescue sorties during the Vietnam War from January 1970 until mid-1971, and also provided helicopter support to Strategic Air Command intercontinental ballistic missile sites in the United States. After moving to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida in June 1971, the wing assumed responsibility for numerous rescue detachments in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. The 39th redesignated as the 39th Special Operations Wing at Eglin in 1989 and the unit trained and participated in special operations exercises, as well as continuing to fly rescue sorties. The wing headquarters and one squadron moved to Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany in May 1989 and became the air component of Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR). In May 1990, following the establishment of Air Force Special Operations Command, the 39th transferred from MAC to AFSOC. In response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the majority of the 39 SOW personnel deployed to Turkey (12‚Äì17 January 1991), and operated as part of the Joint Special Operations Task Force Elusive Concept. The wing moved to RAF Alconbury, England effective 1 January 1992 and continued to serve as the air component for SOCEUR. In December 1992, the 39th inactivated, replaced by the 352nd Special Operations Group and consolidating activities from Rhein-Main and RAF Woodbridge. 352nd Special Operations Group The 352nd trained for and performed special operations airland and airdrop missions in the U.S. European Command area of operations, including establishing air assault landing zones, controlling close air support by strike aircraft and gunships, and providing trauma care for wounded and injured personnel. Deployed elements also participated in Operation Provide Comfort II. During the 1990s, the group supported numerous humanitarian and combat operations in Europe, Africa, and Southwest Asia, including Operations Provide Promise, Deny Flight, and Allied Force in Yugoslavia, and Provide Comfort and Northern Watch over northern Iraq. In February 1995, the 352nd relocated from RAF Alconbury to its current home of RAF Mildenhall. The 352nd rushed troops to Dubrovnik, Croatia, when an Air Force Boeing T-43 Bobcat carrying U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown crashed into a mountain. Arriving in a nasty rainstorm, 21st Special Operations Squadron MH-53 Pave Low helicopters inserted the first search-and-rescue teams, followed by a 67th Special Operations Squadron Lockheed MC-130P. RAF Mildenhall crews remained on scene until the last body was removed. In 2002, the 352nd took part in Operation Autumn Return, the non-combatant evacuation of American citizens from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire. Today, the 352nd develops and implements peacetime and wartime contingency plans to effectively use fixed wing, helicopter, and personnel assets to conduct infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of U.S. and allied special operations forces. 352nd Special Operations Wing The 352nd SOG was upgraded to wing status in March 2015 with an anticipated move to Spangdahlem Air Base Germany in 2017, with the planned closure of RAF Mildenhall. But as of April 2017, the closure process of RAF Mildenhall has been put on indefinite hold. As of December 2018, it was planned that USAF personnel will move from RAF Mildenhall to RAF Fairford by 2024 the earliest.

This definition applied to the following offences: *obtaining property by deception, contrary to section 15 of the Theft Act 1968The Theft Act 1968, section 15(4) *obtaining a money transfer by deception, contrary to section 15A of the Theft Act 1968The Theft Act 1968, section 15B(1) and (2) *obtaining pecuniary advantage by deception, contrary to section 16 of the Theft Act 1968The Theft Act 1968, section 16(3) *Procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, contrary to section 20(2) of the Theft Act 1968The Theft Act 1968, section 20(3) *obtaining services by deception, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1978The Theft Act 1978, section 5(1) *evasion of liability by deception, contrary to section 2 of the Theft Act 1978The Theft Act 1978, section 5(1) Sections 15, 15A, 16 and 20(2) of the Theft Act 1968, and sections 1 and 2 of the Theft Act 1978, were repealed on 15 January 2007 by the Fraud Act 2006. The offences listed above have been called \\"deception offences\\".Ormerod, David. Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. Thirteenth Edition. Oxford University Press. Section 23.1.2 at page 870. Deliberate or reckless A deception will be deliberate when the defendant knows that what he represents as true is untrue. This is predominantly a subjective test, matching the general approach to establishing intentional behaviour. The test of recklessness is also predominantly subjective to show that the defendant is aware that what is represented may or may not be true, excluding the extended meaning of recklessness in R v Caldwell [1982] AC 341. Words or conduct Deceptions are most commonly made by saying or not saying something significant, as in the advance fee fraud, in which the defendant tells the victim that he is a rich person who needs discreetly to move money abroad, and wants to use the victim's bank account in return for a percentage of the money transferred. Mere conduct, however, can also imply facts which are untrue. Thus, wearing a particular uniform represents that the person is employed in that occupation, or writing a cheque supported by a cheque card represents that the writer has actual authority from the bank to use the card and that the bank will honour the cheque (see Metropolitan Police Commissioner v CharlesMetropolitan Police Commissioner v Charles [1977] AC 177, [1976] 3 WLR 431, [1976] 3 All ER 112, 63 Cr App R 252, [1977] Crim LR 615, HL, sub nom Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis v Charles.). If the defendant's words or conduct innocently represent something that later becomes untrue, or the defendant becomes aware the \\"victim\\" has made a mistake, they are obligated to correct the misunderstanding. Failure to do so can amount to deception. In Director of Public Prosecutions v RayDirector of Public Prosecutions v Ray [1974] AC 370, [1973] 3 WLR 359, [1973] 3 All ER 131, 117 SJ 663, 58 Cr App R 130, sub nom Ray v Sempers [1974] Crim LR 181, HL, reversing sub nom Ray v Sempers [1973] 1 WLR 317 the defendant, after eating in a restaurant, decided not to pay for a meal. The defendant continued to sit quietly, lulling the waiters into believing payment would be made in due course, and thereby obtained the opportunity to leave without paying. Consequently, silence or an omission can be a continuing representation that nothing material has changed and so be a deception. This reasoning has also been applied to the offence of obtaining a service by deception, contrary to section 1 of the Theft Act 1978. In R v Rai,R v Rai [2000] 1 Cr App R 242, 164 JP 121, [2000] Crim LR 192, CA the defendant applied for a grant to adapt the house of his infirm mother. After the work had commenced, he failed to inform the local authority that his mother had died, and thereby obtained completion of the work. His conduct, taken as a whole, amounted to a continuing representation that she was alive. Fact or law Most deceptions relate to actual or supposed facts, or to an existing state of affairs, but this is distinguished from a false statement of opinion which, no matter how persuasive, is not a deception. Deception offences include situations where the defendant represents that counterfeited goods are genuine items, or misrepresents their identity (e.g., R v Barnard,R v Barnard (1837) 7 C & P 784, (1837) 173 ER 342 where the defendant represented that he was a student to an Oxford bookshop to qualify for their scheme of discounting books to students), or asserts that an envelope contains money. Statements may appear equivocal and still be a deception. Thus, in R v King [1979] CLR 279 the defendant admitted that the mileage on a car he was selling might not be correct. He had actually altered the odometer, so this statement was true, but he was properly convicted because in a second statement, he claimed not to know whether the odometer was correct, which was false. Similarly, a man dressed as a police officer who instructs someone to act in a particular way because 'the law requires it,' or a lawyer or accountant who relies on their professional status to mislead a client as to the law for their private benefit, deceives even though the general policy of English law is ignorantia juris non excusat, i.e. the Latin for ignorance of the law does not excuse and so everyone is presumed to know what the law is. Present intentions In Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray,Director of Public Prosecutions v Ray [1974] AC 370, [1973] 3 WLR 359, [1973] 3 All ER 131, 117 SJ 663, 58 Cr App R 130, sub nom Ray v Sempers [1974] Crim LR 181, HL, reversing sub nom Ray v Sempers [1973] 1 WLR 317 the defendant who sits in a restaurant impliedly represents that they intend to pay for the meal. This is a representation as to present intention and it would be a deception whether the defendant has sufficient money to pay. It is distinguishable from the defendants who hide their money so that they can represent an inability to pay (a misrepresentation as to fact). =Deception and theft= There is an inevitable overlap between the general offence of theft, contrary to section 1(1), and these offences because they cover both general and specific situations in which the defendant will appropriate property by using some form of deception. Deception offences are separately defined to avoid any problems that might arise when the \\"victim\\" consents to the taking. Because the effect of the deception may be to persuade the owner to pass title to the goods, albeit on a voidable title, those goods may not \\"belong to another\\" at the time of the appropriation. In fact, strong authority has emerged that this is not a real problem because an appropriation is the \\"assumption\\" of the rights of ownership, whether that assumption is effective in law: see R v Gomez [1993] AC 442 . This case has been criticised because it apparently eliminates the need for the section 15 offence. Yet the deception offences are preserved and are the preferred charges in situations involving deceptive behaviour both because theft carries a lower minimum sentence, and as a matter of general principle, because a charge should describe what the defendant actually did in the simplest and most direct form. Republic of Ireland Sections 2(1) and (2) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 provide a definition of deception. It applies to the following offences: *Making gain or causing loss by deception, contrary to section 6 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 *Obtaining services by deception, contrary to section 7 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 *Procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception, contrary to section 11(2)(a) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001 References *Allen, Michael.

Camillo Borghese reigned as Pope Paul V from 1605 to 1621. Caravaggio's biographer Giovanni Bellori records that the artist painted a seated portrait of him as pope, which must place the work between Borghese's election on 16 May 1605 and Caravaggio's flight from Rome in May 1606 following the death of Ranuccio Tommassoni. The portrait is attested in the Borghese collection from 1650. Many scholars have doubted the authenticity of this painting, considering the composition too uninspired for the artist's style. But the scholar John Gash in his authoritative (revised) 2003 catalogue of Caravaggio believes the work is genuine, pointing out that the pose would have been beyond the artist's control - Paul V was noted for his dignified and even taciturn demeanor, and would be unlikely to accept direction. \\"[H]is unostentatious bearing exemplifies the sober, cautious and, in fact, genuinely religious spirit of the man...\\". Gash also points out that Paul's narrowed eyes, far from conveying suspicion and malevolence as many writers assert, are the result of chronic myopia. Also note the startling similarities between this portrait and Vel√°zquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X. According to Bellori Caravaggio obtained his introduction to Paul through the papal nephew, cardinal Scipione Borghese. Scipione was an avid art collector, destined to acquire many of Caravaggio's canvasses, but he was to prove of little value as a patron either to Caravaggio or to others, preferring to enhance his collection through extortion and sharp practice rather than by support and purchase. He would eventually become one of the crucial figures in Caravaggio's final days.

The Tavianis used both professional and non-professional actors from the Sardinian countryside.. The title () literally means \\"Father Master\\"; it has been translated as My Father, My Master or Father and Master. The drama was originally filmed by the Taviani brothers for Italian television but won the 1977 Palme d'Or prize at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival.Curran, Daniel, ed. Foreign Films, film review and analysis of Padre Padrone, page 135, 1989. Evanston, Illinois: Cinebooks. . The film depicts a Sardinian shepherd who is terrorized by his domineering father and tries to escape by educating himself. He eventually becomes a celebrated linguist. The drama is based on an autobiographical book of the same title by Gavino Ledda. Plot The film opens in documentary style at the elementary school in Siligo that six-year- old Gavino (Saverio Marconi) is attending. His tyrannical peasant father (Omero Antonutti) barges in and announces to the teacher and the students that Gavino must leave school and tend the family sheep. Under his father's watchful eyes and the victim of his sadistic behavior, Gavino passes the next fourteen years tending sheep in the Sardinian mountains. There he begins to discover ‚Äúthings‚Äù for himself and to rebel against his father. Gavino is rescued from his family and his isolation when he is called for military service. During his time with the army he learns about electronics, the Italian language and classical music, yearning all the while for a university education. When Gavino returns home, he declares to his father that he will attend university. His father is against this and tells him that he will throw him out of the family home. They have a nasty fight, but Gavino eventually attends university and emerges as a brilliant student. He becomes a linguist, specializing in the origins of the Sardinian language. The film ends in documentary style again as Gavino Ledda himself tells why he wrote his book and what Sardinian children may expect as inhabitants of a rural area with close ties to the land.

It's also a bit simple: The patriarchal behavior of Gavino's father is so readily accepted as an unfathomable given constant that the film never offers much insight into the man or the culture that fostered him. Intriguingly aberrant behavior is chalked up to tradition, and thus robbed of some of its ferocity. But the film is vivid and very moving, coarse but seldom blunt, and filled with raw landscapes that underscore the naturalness and inevitability of the father-son rituals it depicts.\\"Maslin, Janet.

He was best known for publishing books and magazines on erotica and art and for his conviction in 1963 for violating federal obscenity laws. Biography Ralph Ginzburg was born in Brooklyn on October 28, 1929, to Russian-Jewish immigrant parents. He went to New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and was president of his class. Since his parents hoped that he could be an accountant, when he first enrolled in City College of New York after high school, he majored in accounting. While Ginzburg was taking a journalism class at CCNY, his professor, Irving Rosenthal, realised his talent in journalism and encouraged him to accept an editorial job on the school newspaper, The Ticker.Williams, C. F. (2012). Eros in America: Freud and the counter culture. Ginzburg later became editor-in-chief of it, which further fostered his passion for journalism. After graduating in 1949, Ginzburg found a job in The New York Daily Compass as a copy boy and cub reporter. He had to leave his job and join the army for the Korean War two years later, and was assigned to Fort Myer, Va., to work for the Public Information Office, where he both edited the post newspaper and took wedding photos for base marriages. Meanwhile, he worked full-time at night as a copy editor for the erstwhile Times-Herald in nearby Washington. D.C. .One of his colleagues, an inquiring photographer for the newspaper, was Jackie Lee Bouvier (later Kennedy Onassis). Following his discharge, Ginzburg worked briefly at NBC, then joined Look magazine as circulation promotion manager. He also worked for Reader's Digest, Collier's, and, as he put it, \\"other pillars of communications industry respectability\\". An article he wrote during his spare time, An Unhurried View of Erotica, impressed Esquire's publisher Arnold Gingrich, and therefore he was offered a job as articles editor at Esquire. During his times there, he expanded the article to a 20,000-word manuscript and published it as a book. This rather scholarly seeming book explored an ostensible undercurrent of pornography that runs throughout English literature. Beginning with a manuscript given by Leofric, Bishop of Exeter,The Exeter Book, a codex of Anglo-Saxon poems and one of the most important existing examples of Anglo-Saxon literature, was donated to the library by Leofric. It would have been valuable, as it was about 100 years old at the time. Although accurate translation of the work is currently impossible, the poem Wulf and Eadwacer certainly references a woman's physical desire for her absent lover. A fair attempt at a translation to modern English can be found at to his cathedral in 1070 through to the outright pornographic work of the 1950s, An Unhurried View examines examples of English erotic literature in an interpretive and explanatory context. The end of the book includes a bibliography of 100 titles. He convinced the notable psychoanalyst Theodor Reik to write the introduction.The book sold more than 125,000 copies in hardback and over 200,000 in print, showing Ginzburg a large potential market for this kind of publication as well as his talents in the mailing business.POWE, J. (2010). The Obscenity Bargain: Ralph Ginzburg for Fanny Hill. Journal of Supreme Court History, 35(2), 166-176. In August 1961, Ginzburg managed to conduct an extensive interview of 18-year-old Bobby Fischer. Ginzburg said he got in touch with Fischer by simply giving Fischer's older sister Joan a call, and he \\"got along well\\" with Fischer. He sold the interview, entitled \\"Portrait of a Genius As a Young Chess Master\\" to Harper's Magazine, which published it in January 1962. The interview of the reclusive chess genius became one of the most famous interviews in history, especially among chess players, and has gained great popularity ever since, partly as the first public indication of Fischer's paranoia and critical behaviours.Verwer, R. (2014). Bobby Fischer for Beginners: The Most Famous Chess Player Explained. New In Chess. However, Bobby Fischer himself hated the article and denied most of it, claiming that it was not even a remotely accurate representation of his actual statements or his life,Brady, F. (2011). Endgame: Bobby Fischer's Remarkable Rise and Fall-from America's Brightest Prodigy to the Edge of Madness. Broadway Books. while Ralph Ginzburg destroyed all of the research materials that would have backed his interview. The interview made young Fischer furious and \\"created a distrust of reporters\\", and therefore it became practically the last formal interview Fischer ever gave, which ironically added to its popularity. After he finally saved enough money to rent his own office--a fifth-floor walk-up in an old Manhattan office building, Ginzburg published his first self-published book, \\"100 Years of Lynching\\" in 1962, a collection of newspaper accounts that directly exposed the history and the status quo of American racism. The book was a sign that Ginzburg had wed his business to his interest in social activism, and it was regularly adapted by African American studies as one of the primary pedagogical materials to show the harsh nature of pre-civil-rights race relations in America. During this period Ginzburg also published Liaison, a biweekly newsletter, and \\"The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity\\" by Lillian Maxine Serett, writing as Rey Anthony. Ginzburg's most famous publication, Eros, a high-priced magazine of classy erotica, was launched in 1962 too, and only four issues were published before he was indicted on charges of violating federal obscenity laws and had to stop publishing the quarterly. He was found guilty by the Supreme Court eventually and sentenced to five years in prison. (He was released after eight months). Ginzburg's next publication was Fact, a political journal with a muckraking bent, published between January 1964 and August 1967. The magazine cost him another famous lawsuit after he published a special issue claiming that Senator Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate that year, was psychologically unfit for the office. He lost the lawsuit again and had to pay $1 in compensatory damages and $75,000 in punitive damages to Senator Goldwater. From 1968 to 1971, Ginzburg published Avant Garde, an art and culture magazine with graphic and logogram designed by Herb Lubalin, and the logo font of the magazine later gave birth to a well-known typeface of the same name. Avant Garde focused on radical politics and stopped publication when Ginzburg started serving his sentence in 1972. (He wrote \\"Castrated: My Eight Months in a Federal Prison\\" to describe his time in prison.) Although he tried to revive it as a tabloid newspaper with his wife after his release from prison, his attempt failed and the new Avant Garde lasted only one issue. The failure to revive Avant Garde and the lost lawsuit drove Ginzburg to the brink of bankruptcy, but he was saved by the success of his next periodical, the biweekly consumer adviser Moneysworth, which meant to resemble Consumer Reports and presumably netted 2 to 3 million a year in rentals.Heidenry, J. (2002). What Wild Ecstasy. Simon and Schuster. Apart from publishing and editing, Ginzburg continued to be an activist. In 1968, Ginzburg signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post Ginzburg's interest in activism also extended to opposing circumcision. In 1986, he founded Outlaw Unnecessary Circumcision in Hospitals (O.U.C.H.), a non-profit organisation against circumcision, striving to stop health insurance companies from funding circumcision surgery and therefore lowering the rate of American baby boys being circumcised [7]. When Ginzburg turned 55, he retired from publishing and started a second career as a photojournalist. He became a freelance photographer for The New York Post, specialising in New York scenes. His last book, \\"I Shot New York\\", consisted of images he took of life in New York City on 365 consecutive days. Ralph Ginzburg died of multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bones in 2006. He was 76. Eros Magazine In 1962, Ginzburg began publication of his first major work, Eros, which was a quarterly hardbound periodical containing articles and photo-essays on love and sex. Herb Lubalin was the art director and second on the masthead. It was named after the Greek god of love and desire, Eros. The publication was bound in cardboard in a 13\\" x 10\\" format, averaging about 90 pages in length. Only four issues of Eros were published. Ginzburg attempted to get mailing privileges from postmasters at Blue Ball and Intercourse, Pennsylvania, but was declined because the anticipated volume was more than what the post office of these two small towns could handle, and therefore at last Ginzburg settled to send his magazines from Middlesex, New Jersey.Parker, G. E. (1970). Words Speak Louder than Judgments. Chitty's LJ, 18, 75. According to Ginzburg, Eros was published as \\"the result of recent court decisions that have realistically interpreted America's obscenity law that has given this country a new breath of freedom of expression\\".Bickel, A. M. (1978). The Supreme Court and the idea of progress. Yale University Press. Pushing and testing the boundaries of censorship after the case of Roth v. United States,Navasky, V. S. (2013). Kennedy justice. Open Road Media. Ginzburg made the best of such freedom and devoted the magazine to \\"the joys of love and sex\\", making Eros entertaining at the first glance. The third issue of Eros published of a collection of nude pictures of Marilyn Monroe, taken by the Bert Stern during the shoot famously known as \\"The Last Sitting\\" six weeks before she died,Ablard, C. D. (1966). Obscenity, Advertising, and Publishing: The Impact of Ginzburg and Mishkin. Geo. Wash. L. Rev., 35, 85. and those photos were among the most famous Monroe images ever recorded. Meanwhile, Eros, in fact, contained more sophisticated and critical subtexts. It offered a wide cover of sexuality in history, politics, art and literature. With his good taste of writing and editorial talents, Ginzburg presented a careful selection of articles in Eros, including works written by big-name authors like Guy de Maupassant and Allen Ginsberg, while giving out social activism messages such as liberation from excess repression, desacralising democratisation of art, race equality, anti-war and so on. The design of Eros by Herb Lubalin has also made it a clean, elegant literary and lithographic work of art \\"suitable for coffee table\\". It has an elegantly oversized format and printed on both matte and glossy paper, and with hardback covers, making it more like a book rather than a quarterly magazine. The selection of arts in the magazine also emphasised the great taste of Ginsburg and Lubalin. Art that addressed the extent to which the erotic was a theme, throughout the ages, by major painters and sculptors, were shown in Eros, along with bold and sensitive layouts for photographic portfolios by modern photographers. Eros magazine is significant in American publishing history as it covered and helped to incite the sexual revolution, while it also contributed to the formation of counter-culture in the late 1960s. =Issues= No. 1 (Spring, 1962) The cover was mustard-coloured and featured \\"an embossed playing card of Bluebeard and one of his maids\\". The issue included short stories by Ray Bradbury and Guy de Maupassant, an extract from Eric Partridge's \\"vulgar dictionary\\" and poems by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester. No. 2 (Summer, 1962) The cover of No. 2 pictured a young couple in swimsuits, kissing passionately; it was printed in two colours, black and greenish-yellow, with a red-orange logo. The inside covers repeated the theme in red (front) and blue (back). It featured photo essays about John F Kennedy, French prostitutes and erotic statues in India, the first publication in a magazine of Mark Twain's short story \\"1601\\" and \\"an antique patent submission for a male chastity belt\\". No. 3 (Autumn, 1962) Issue No. 3 was centred on an 18-page photo shoot of the recently deceased Marilyn Monroe (the pictures were taken by Bert Stern six weeks before her death). It also featured a piece by Bonnie Prudden, an extract from Fanny Hill and an article on Samuel Roth. No. 4 (Winter, 1962) This issue published a letter by Allen Ginsberg, a profile of Frank Harris, and 'an eight-page \\"photographic tone poem\\"' titled \\"Black and White in Color\\", featuring a nude couple, but with no pubic parts shown, with an African- American man and a European-American girl. It has been contended that the magazine was persecuted on racist grounds, under the wave of mass racial violence in the South of the United States, and that there would have been no such persecution if the photos had featured a couple of the same color. = Ginzburg v. United States =  The Trials in lower courts  Attorney General Robert Kennedy was offended by the Eros after the second issue was published, which contained a photo-essay of the phenomenon of female reaction to President John F. Kennedy (brother of Robert Kennedy), in the run-up to the 1960 election. He held off his instinct to prosecute, however, afraid that \\"it would hurt politically by solidifying Kennedy's image as a puritanical Catholic\\". Meanwhile, while Ginzburg sent out millions of flyers to promote his magazines, both local and federal prosecutors received complaints from recipients of Ginzburg's mailing, and organisations like The National Office for Decent Literature even encouraged their members to send complaints to post offices.Allyn, D. (2016). Make love, not war: the sexual revolution: an unfettered history. routledge.Day, J. E. (1966). Mailing Lists and Pornography. American Bar Association Journal, 1103-1109. At last, the fourth final issue of Eros, with the eight pages of colour photos showing a naked muscular black man and a naked white woman embracing each other, finally convinced Kennedy to authorise prosecution. He was supported by Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and Solicitor General Archibald Cox, and Katzenbach believed that they would eventually prosecute Ginzburg because of his continual testing of boundaries of obscenity in his magazine, \\"so why wait\\". Ginzburg was first put into charge in racially polarised Philadelphia in 1963 and was indicted for Eros, Liaison and the Housewife's Handbook. Those publications were deemed obscene by the court and Ginzburg was found guilty of 28 violations, sentenced to serve five years and fined totalling $42,000.Casper, G., Hutchinson, D. J., & Strauss, D. A. (Eds.). (1991). The Supreme Court Review, 1990. University of Chicago Press. The Trial Judge, Ralph Body, explained the finding of the court as: > In conclusion, after a thorough reading and review of all the indicted > materials, this Court finds that said materials are compilations of sordid > narrations dealing with sex, in each case in a manner designed to appeal to > prurient interests. They are devoid of theme or ideas. Throughout the pages > of each can be found constant repetition of patently offensive words used > solely to convey debasing portrayals of natural and unnatural sexual > experiences. Each in its own way is a blow to sense, not merely sensibility. > They are all dirt for dirt's sake and dirt for money's sake. Ginzburg appealed, and a year later the Third Circuit easily affirmed the decision of the lower court. He appealed again and his case got to the Supreme Court in 1965.  The Trial in The Supreme Court  The Supreme Court could not easily accept Judge Ralph Body's decision that publications of Ginzburg were obscene since it would contradict the position the Court had already taken in the Roth v. United States, the Jacobellis v. Ohio and numerous other similar cases.Friedman, L. (1966). The Ginzburg Decision and the Law. The American Scholar, 71-91.Semonche, J. E. (1965). Definitional and Contextual Obscenity: The Supreme Court's New and Disturbing Accommodation. UCLA L. Rev., 13, 1173. Under such consideration and borrowing principles from the Roth case, the Supreme Court carefully assumed that \\"standing alone, the publications (Eros, Liaison and The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity) themselves might not be obscene.\\" To revise the determination of obscenity, the Court introduced a new concept of variable obscenity that \\"consideration of the setting in which the publications were presented\\" should be included as an aid to determining the question of obscenity. \\"Where the purveyor's sole emphasis is on the sexually provocative aspects of his publications, that fact may be decisive in the determination of obscenity\\" In short, The Court decided that even non-obscene materials can support an obscenity conviction if the motives of sellers contain obscenityNeef, M., & Nagel, S. (1974). Judicial Behavior in Pornography Cases. J. Urb. L., 52, 1. and therefore mailing advertisements for obscene material would be considered illegal, even though the material actually sent in response to orders resulting from the advertisement was not obscene itself. The focus of Ginzburg's case was thus shifted to the promotion and distribution of those publications. Ginzburg had sought mailing privileges from postmasters at Blue Ball and Intercourse, Pennsylvania, and the trial court found it obvious that \\"these hamlets were chosen only for the value their names would have in\\". His advertisement for his publication was also sexually enticing as he knew that it would best attract the attention of the potential customers, while Mr Justice Brennan saw the \\"leer of the sensualist\\" in those advertisements, for \\"reader would look for titillation, not for saving intellectual content\\". Therefore, the court concluded that Ginzburg's methods of advertising and distributing were attempts to pander to prurient interests with no redeeming social advantages [20], and obscenity was found according to such motive. The final decision of Ginzburg's fate was reached on March 21, 1966, after a five to four majority affirmed Ginzburg's conviction for violating a federal statute and found him guilty of \\"commercial exploitation,\\" of \\"pandering,\\" and of \\"titillation.\\",Loewy, A. H. (1968). Warren Court as Defender of State and Federal Criminal Laws: A Reply to Those Who Believe That the Court is Oblivious to the Needs of Law Enforcement. Geo. Wash. L. Rev., 37, 1218. crimes he was in fact not charged of. It is noticeable that the court made it clear that though the publications of Ginzburg themselves were protected by First Amendment,Ginzburg's conduct, attitude, motives were not, and he was in fact found guilty because of his sexual-exciting advertising methods, where First Amendment could not apply according to the court.Dyson, R. B. (1966). Looking-Glass Law: An Analysis of the Ginzburg Case. U. Pitt. L. Rev., 28, 1. After the loss of his last plea to vacate his conviction (an appeal courts earlier reduce his sentence from five to three), Ginzburg started his time in prison in 1972, and was released on parole eight months later, probably thanks to the effort of his supporters including novelist Sloan Wilson.  Contributing factors to Ginzburg's conviction  Ralph Ginzburg was quickly put into charges and convicted partly because he was responsible for not only production (as editor), but also promotion and distribution (as publisher) for Eros, Liaison, and the Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity. When there was no necessity to sort out the responsibility of different parties, any theory of the case could apply to him, just as the Supreme Court has done by shifting focus from the publications themselves to the way Ginzburg promoted them and found him guilty eventually. The quickness of Ginzburg's conviction was also under the influence of McCarthyism. Kathryn Ganahan, the Chair of the Post Office Operations Subcommittee and Congresswoman of Philadelphia, where Ginzburg was originally put into trial, demanded prosecution of Ginzburg and claimed obscenity was \\"part of an international communist plot\\". Released documents from FBI also showed that he was under investigation for suspicion of being a communist, and there was even a letter to J. Edgar Hoover claiming that Ralph Ginzburg was an influential Communist Party member. Another contributing factor to Ginzburg's being indicted and found guilty was his appearance. When magazines are typically deemed as an extension of their editors,Ferguson, M. (1983), Forever feminine: Women's magazines and the cult of femininity. Ashgate Pub Co. and editors would be considered as representatives of ideal readers of the magazines,Crewe, B. (2003). Representing men: Cultural production and producers in the men's magazine market. the appearance of Ralph Ginzburg would only give out a bad impression for his magazine. especially when his magazines were about sex. He looked exactly like Central Casting's idea of a pornographer: \\"shady, you might say shifty, with a thin, sallow face and a small mustache\\". Paul Bender, former clerk for Justice Felix Frankfurter, who argued on behalf of the government in the case, described Ginzburg as \\"a smut peddler\\". Though unlike Hefner of Playboy, he wasn't selling himself as the face of his magazine, his appearance implicated that the magazines would be of lower interest, not the fact that it was more upscale with an artistic taste. On the other hand, His appearance also kept him from gaining more supporters during and after the trial.Stein, R. (1972, February).The Punishment for Bad Taste is Three Years. New York Magazine,52-53. To borrow from Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court during the period of Ginzburg's case, Ginzburg lost because he was as unattractive a First Amendment claimant as possible.  Reception of the conviction of Ginzburg  First Amendment advocates including IF Stone, Sloan Wilson and Arthur Miller protested for Ginzburg's conviction. Commenting on the case and Ginzburg's conviction, Arthur Miller had concluded beautifully in the late 1960s: fact: (magazine) From January 1964, to August 1967, Ginzburg published a quarterly magazine named fact:, which could be characterized as a humorous, scathingly satiric journal of comment on current society and politics. fact: had surprisingly little erotic content. Rather, it contained articles such as 1,189 Psychiatrists Say Barry Goldwater is Unfit for the Presidency. The Goldwater article purported to find the senator paranoid, sexually insecure, suicidal, and \\"grossly psychotic.\\" Goldwater later sued and won the suit.Reason Magazine, June 2008. Goldwater Unfiltered. p. 58 One of the editors of fact: was Robert Anton Wilson, a prolific science fiction author whose works include the Illuminatus! series. Avant Garde From January, 1968, through July, 1971, Ginzburg published Avant Garde, a handsome softbound periodical. Ginzburg's age and federal conviction had calmed him down some by this time: Avant Garde could not be termed obscene, but it is filled with creative imagery often caustically critical of American society and government, sexual themes, and (for the time) crude language. One cover #6, January 1969,\\"In Full Bloom\\" (photograph)er by Dewayne Dalrymple featured a naked pregnant woman; another had a parody of Willard's famous patriotic painting, \\"The Spirit of '76\\", with a white woman and a black man.#7, March 1969,\\"The Spirit of 1976\\" (photograph) by Carl Fischer. Avant Garde had a modest circulation but was extremely popular in certain circles, including New York's advertising and editorial art directors.AIGA, August 4, 2004, \\"Crimes Against Typography\\" by Steven Heller http://journal.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=_getfullarticle&aid;=537383 Herbert F. Lubalin (1918‚Äì1981), a post-modern design guru, was Ginzburg's collaborator on his four best-known magazines, including Avant Garde which gave birth to a well-known typeface of the same name. It was originally intended primarily for use in logos: the first version consisted solely of 26 capital letters. It was inspired by Ginzburg and his wife, designed by Lubalin, and realized by Lubalin's assistants and Tom Carnase, one of Lubalin's partners. It is characterized by geometrically perfect round strokes; short, straight lines; and an extremely large number of ligatures and negative kerning. The International Typeface Corporation (ITC) (of which Lubalin was a founder) released a full version in 1970.

It stars Michael Douglas, Andy Garc√≠a, Ken Takakura, and Kate Capshaw and features Y≈´saku Matsuda (in his final film role before his death that year) and Shigeru K≈çyama. The film focuses on two NYPD officers who arrest a member of the Yakuza and must escort him back to Japan. Once there, he escapes, and the two officers find themselves dragged deeper and deeper into the Japanese underworld. Black Rain was released by Paramount Pictures on September 22, 1989. Upon release, the film received generally mixed to positive reviews from critics, which praised the performances, action sequences, Hans Zimmer's musical score, direction and editing but criticized the screenwriting, clich√©d story and lack of character development, yet, following the years, the film became a major cult film and since has been widely praised. Despite mixed reviews, Black Rain was a huge box office hit with grossing over $134 million worldwide in front of a production budget of $30 million, and was nominated for two Academy Awards; Best Sound and Best Sound Editing. Plot Nick Conklin is a New York City police officer facing possible criminal charges; Internal Affairs believes Nick was involved with his partner, who was caught taking criminal money in a corruption scandal. Nick, who has financial difficulties, is divorced from his wife, who has custody of their two children. At a restaurant, Nick and his longtime partner Charlie Vincent observe two Japanese men meeting with Mafia gangsters. Nick's suspicions are validated when another Japanese man enters the restaurant, seizes a small package at gunpoint, kills two people, and leaves. Nick and Charlie chase and arrest the suspect after he nearly kills Nick. They learn that the suspect's name is Sato, whom Nick and Charlie are told will be extradited to Osaka and given to the police there. Though angered that Sato will not be prosecuted in the US, Nick agrees to escort him; Nick's captain believes this will keep Nick from causing more trouble and exacerbating the already biased Internal Affairs investigation. When they arrive in Osaka, they surrender Sato to the Japanese police, only to discover that they were duped by impostors and that Sato has escaped. Nick convinces the Osaka police to allow them to observe the investigation, though their weapons are confiscated. They are joined by local police detective Masahiro Matsumoto. While they have dinner at one night, Nick behaves rudely and offends Matsumoto while Charlie attempts to be more polite. Nick also makes contact with an American nightclub hostess, Joyce, who explains that Nick and Charlie represent American inefficiency and stupidity to the Japanese. Through her, Nick discovers Sato is fighting a gang war with a notorious mob boss, Sugai, and traveled to New York to disrupt Sugai's counterfeiting scheme. Nick joins a police raid without permission and takes a few $100 bills from the crime scene. The next day, Matsumoto confronts them over the theft - which has been subsequently reported in America. When Matsumoto tells Nick and Charlie that they have dishonored themselves and him as well as the police force because of the theft, Nick calls him a snitch and demonstrates the money is counterfeit by burning one of the bills. At night, Nick and Charlie walk back to their hotel drunk and unescorted - despite warnings about their safety. In an apparent prank, a young motorcyclist steals Charlie's coat and leads him to an underground parking garage - where it turns out that the motorcyclist is one of Sato's henchmen and that Sato has lured Nick and Charlie into a trap; Nick, separated from Charlie, watches in horror as Charlie gets attacked before Sato ends up decapitating him. Afterwards, Nick meets up with Joyce and she comforts him at her apartment. Matsumoto later visits Nick to give him Charlie's service pistol, and the two decide to work together in order to take down Sato. Matsumoto and Nick track down one of Sato's operatives downtown. As they observe her movements, Nick confides to Matsumoto that he stole money in New York and never told Charlie about it - though admits that he isn't proud of what he did. The operative eventually retrieves a sample counterfeit note, which she passes to a gangster. Nick and Matsumoto tail him to a steel foundry, where they find Sato is meeting Sugai, and the package from New York is a printing plate for American $100 bills. Nick confronts Sato, who escapes when swarming police arrest Nick for waving a gun in public. Nick is consequently deported back to America, but he sneaks off the plane and visits Matsumoto - who has been suspended and demoted. Matsumoto refuses to help Nick, who then resolves to pursue Sato on his own. Joyce helps him meet Sugai, who explains that making counterfeit US currency is his revenge for the \\"black rain\\", or nuclear fallout, after the bombing of Hiroshima in World War II. Nick suggests a deal where Sugai can use Nick to retrieve the stolen plate from Sato, thus leaving Sugai's reputation clean and allowing Nick to get the chance to apprehend Sato once and for all. Sugai drops Nick at a remote farm with a shotgun. Nick is nearly spotted by one of Sato's lookouts, but Matsumoto arrives and knocks the gangster unconscious. He and Nick quickly deduce that Sato plans a massacre at his meeting with Sugai. When the two crime bosses meet, Sato cuts off one of his fingers in atonement, stabs Sugai, and escapes with the plates - sparking a gunfight between Sugai's and Sato's men. Matsumoto dispatches most of the gunmen while Nick chases Sato in a dirt bike on his own. Nick prevents Sato's escape and the two engage in hand-to- hand combat. Sato initially gets the upper hand, Nick takes advantage of Sato's finger loss to defeat him. When Sato is at his mercy, Nick has the choice of whether or not to kill Sato for Charlie and all the humiliation he has suffered. Sato is spared when Nick and Matsumoto are seen taking him into police headquarters, much to the amazement of the police force. For their contribution to Sato's arrest, Nick and Matsumoto gratefully receive commendations by the police chief superintendent. The pair later bid farewell to each other as Nick prepares to return to America. He thanks Matsumoto for his assistance and friendship, then gives him a dress shirt in a gift box before leaving. Underneath the gift box, Matsumoto finds the counterfeit printing plates and shares a smile with Nick as the protagonist walks away.

Harrison Ford and Kurt Russell were strongly considered for the role of Nick Conklin, before Michael Douglas was cast due to his favorable relationship with producers Sherry Lansing and Stanley R. Jaffe. Production The film began shooting in November 1988 and ended in March 1989. Japanese actor Y≈´saku Matsuda, who played Sato, died of bladder cancer shortly after the film's completion. Director Ridley Scott dedicated the film to his memory. The high cost and red tape involved in filming in Japan prompted director Scott to declare that he would never film in that country again.According to the commentary on the Criterion DVD of Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters Scott was eventually forced to leave the country and complete the final climactic scene (which included American character actor Al Leong) in Napa Valley, California. This film marks the first collaboration between Hans Zimmer and Ridley Scott. He would go on to score several more films for Scott, including Gladiator, Thelma and Louise, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down and Matchstick Men. Japanese musician Ryuichi Sakamoto contributed the song \\"Laserman\\" to the film's soundtrack. =Locations= Large parts of Black Rain were filmed in Osaka, although some of the locations have changed somewhat since the late 1980s when production took place. The original intention of Ridley Scott was to film in the Kabukicho nightlife district of Shinjuku, Tokyo. However, the Osaka authorities were more receptive towards film permits so the similarly futuristic neon-infused D≈çtonbori in Namba was chosen as the principal filming location in Japan. An aerial shot of Osaka bay at sunset with the estuaries of the Yodogawa, Kanzakigawa and Ajigawa rivers frames the opening sequence of the arrival into Japan. The main filming location in Osaka is by the Ebisubashi bridge. The futurist Kirin Plaza building (architect Shin Takamatsu, built 1987), the Ebisubashi and the famous neon wall overlooking the D≈çtonbori canal creates the Blade Runner-esque mise-en-sc√®ne. Umeda, Osaka's northern centre, is represented by the first floor shopping mall concourse of Hankyu Umeda station Terminal Building. Resembling a futuristic neo-gothic nave from a cathedral, this is where Charlie Vincent's (Andy Garcia) jacket is stolen by a bosozoku biker. Because the production could not finish the segment in Japan, Andy's demise, the subsequent escalator chase and car park scenes, replete with appropriate Japanese signs, were shot in downtown Los Angeles. The now removed Shinsaibashi bridge (dismantled in 1995), Osaka Municipal Central Wholesale Market, Nippon Steel Works in Sakai City (south Osaka), Kyobashi, the elevated Hanshin Expressway, Osaka Castle and Nanko Port Town also feature briefly, as well as the Motomachi shopping district of neighbouring Kobe. In New York City, the 1964 World Expo's Unisphere opens the film, followed by Nick Conklin (Michael Douglas) riding over the Queensboro Bridge. The illegal bike race between Nick and an anonymous challenger took place from underneath the west underside of the Brooklyn Bridge north to the Manhattan Bridge. =Music= The soundtrack had various artists with the score composed by Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack was originally released as a 7-track album in 1989 by Virgin Movie Music on cassette, vinyl and compact disc.Black Rain - Original Soundtrack  Songs, Reviews, Credits  AllMusic However, it was re-released in 2012 by La-La Land Records in limited edition as a two-disc package.Hans-Zimmer.com - Black Rain ..

There seems to have been more desperation off the screen than ever gets into the movie. As bad movies go, however. the American 'Black Rain' is easy to sit through, mostly because of the way Mr. Scott and his production associates capture the singular look of contemporary urban Japan.\\"Canby, Vincent (September 22, 1989). \\"Police Chase a Gangster In a Bright, Menacing Japan\\". The New York Times. C12. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four and stated, \\"Even given all of its inconsistencies, implausibilities and recycled cliches, Black Rain might have been entertaining if the filmmakers had found the right note for the material. But this is a designer movie, all look and no heart, and the Douglas character is curiously unsympathetic.\\" Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded the same two-star grade and wrote, \\"The crosscultural action picture might have worked if the filmmakers had come up with a script in which Douglas' character had been rendered weak and confused by being a fish trying to swim in strange waters. But instead he is presented as a traditional action hero dominating everyone in sight. The cultural imperialism of that decision makes for a routine and frequently offensive story full of Asian stereotypes.\\"Siskel, Gene (September 22, 1989). \\"'Black Rain' steers down the wrong course\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 7, Page A. A review in Variety stated, \\"Since this is a Ridley Scott film, 'Black Rain' is about 90% atmosphere and 10% story. But what atmosphere! This gripping crime thriller about hardboiled N.Y. cop Michael Douglas tracking a yakuza hood in Osaka, Japan, boasts magnificent lensing by Jan DeBont and powerfully baroque production design by Norris Spencer.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Black Rain\\". Variety. September 20, 1989. 28. Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times described the plot as \\"standard '80s schtick\\" but called the visuals \\"hellaciously gorgeous\\" and concluded that \\"action movies are one genre where clich√©s can be transcended and execution can triumph over content. That's what happens here.\\"Wilmington, Michael (September 22, 1989). \\"'Black Rain' a Blast of Fiery Razzle-Dazzle\\". Los Angeles Times. Part VI, p. 1, 16. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote that Scott \\"approaches this prickly action thriller with the gusto of a sushi chef in a fish storm. Unfortunately and typically, he loses sight of his story in this artistic barrage of blood and guts. It's a gorgeous, erratic movie most definitely not for those with an aversion to cutlery.\\"Kempley, Rita (September 22, 1989). \\"'Black Rain': All Guts, No Story\\". The Washington Post. B1. The film currently holds a 50% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews. Black Rain was nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Sound (Donald O. Mitchell, Kevin O'Connell, Greg P.

In many countries, especially the Dominican Republic, tamboras were made from salvaged rum barrels.Information on the Tambora Performers on the tambora are referred to as tamboreros. Types There are three types of tambora for the merengue style of music. The oldest kind is the rope-tuned tambora with black-colored heads. This is seen more in folkloric music of the Dominican republic and Afro-Caribbean slaves. The second type is a rope tuned tambora played with goatskin, or \\"chivo\\" heads, either with or without the hair left on. The third type, as made by modern companies, is bolt-tuned with rawhide conga heads. This kind usually has metal or wooden rims to hit as a filler for rhythms, sounding, if one strikes it correctly, something reminiscent of a wood block. This type can also be tuned to higher pitches and can sound like a conga. Role in Merengue In merengue tipico, known also as perico ripiao (the oldest form of merengue), the tambora has a significantly large role, playing many different types of rhythms and variations on those rhythms. However, in orchestra merengue, the tambora usually only plays the merengue derecho rhythm as a background instrument, while congas are the main rhythm instrument, followed by the g√ºira. In orchestra merengue, a separate performer for timbales can be seen very frequently, while in perico ripiao, the timbales and tambora are played most of the time by the same musician (timbales are used most of the time for fills, and, occasionally, solos). Timbales were introduced into the genre by Dominican percussionist Ray \\"Chino\\" Diaz.Ray \\"Chino\\" Diaz at congahead.com Basic strokes There are three basic strokes: slap, rim/woodblock, and open tone: these three are all used in standard merengue rhythms, such as merengue derecho (most common merengue form) and pambiche.

It is a poetic, rather than realistic, depiction of what Jarman felt was the loss of traditional English culture in the 1980s and his anger about Thatcher's England (including the formation of Section 28 Local Government Act), declaring it a homophobic and repressive totalitarian state. In 1986, Jarman was also diagnosed as HIV positive and had just finished his 'masterpiece', Caravaggio, so the film is a confluence of angry imagination. It is named after The Last of England, a painting by Ford Madox Brown. The painting and the film, share themes of escape and the changing of place. The film uses a shaky hand-held camera to evoke anxiety and paranoia, and the ever-present melancholy is expressed in the extracts from poems, including T.S. Eliot's The Hollow Men and Allen Ginsberg's \\"Howl\\", which are monotonously read by narrator Nigel Terry. One of the film's most famous scenes is of Tilda Swinton, dressed not unlike the woman from Brown's painting, as a bride mourning her executed husband, screaming and letting out a primal cry whilst rubbish burns around her. The scene was shot near the director's home on the beach of Dungeness, Kent. Other images in the film, are counterpointed by Bach violin sonatas and 1980s disco. Skulls, fire and ashes embody death and destruction, while scenes of sex on a Union Jack flag and 'Spring' masturbating show a disregard for social conventions and suggest a country in a state of chaos and sordid decadence.

Also Tilda Swinton received the jury prize for her performance in the film. Reviews On Rotten Tomatoes, it has an average score of 68%, based on 3 reviews. 'What proof do you need the world's curling up like an autumn leaf?' is Time Out magazine's review. \\"Terrible\\" is David Bezanson's review, \\"Impressionistic\\" doesn't have to mean \\"bad\\" and \\"It's graphic and disorienting, yet also totally trite\\". Book Jarman wrote a book to accompany the film, which deals more explicitly with the relationship he had with his father, who was a Lancaster bomber pilot in the Second World War. Jarman used the impact of his father's despair, depression and violence on his own artistic vision. The depression that his father suffered is attributed to the high number of fatalities that bomber crews experienced and the carpet-bombing of civilians. The book and to a lesser extent the film are very much in the tradition of Roland Barthes Camera Lucida, Susan Sontag's On Photography, Jeanette Winterson's Art Objects and to a lesser extent John Berger's Ways of Seeing in that he has used the deeply familiar and personal as a vehicle for dialogue about art and contemporary culture. Soundtrack album Two versions of the soundtrack album were released on the Mute Records label. The LP has one side (\\"Bombers\\") by Simon Turner, and the other (\\"Diplomat\\") by a variety of performers, including Mayo Thompson with Albert Oehlen and Tilda Swinton; Andy Gill with Dean Garcia, Barry Adamson and Martin Micarrick, Brian Gulland and Diamanda Galas.

Like the US counterpart, the Ad Council (where the Ad Council Japan is modelled), Ad Council Japan generally does not produce public service advertisements itself; rather, it acts as a coordinator and distributor. Its advertising campaigns are divided into three; national campaign, regional campaign and aid campaign. The advertising campaigns are changed yearly in July, the month Ad Council Japan was founded. Ad Council Japan accepts requests from sponsor organizations for Japanese advertising campaigns that focus on particular social issues. To qualify, an issue must be non-partisan and have Asian and Japanese national or regional relevance. Ad Council Japan then assigns each campaign to a volunteer advertising agency that produces the actual advertisements. Finally, Ad Council Japan distributes the finished advertisements to media outlets. Some advertising campaigns only appear on a certain medium, such as on printed media only. During the TV coverage of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami events, the vast majority of advertisers withdrew their advertising, resulting in a massive increase in filler advertisements by AC Japan, many of which promoted traditional Japanese virtues, such as mutual help (giri, on,Ruth Benedict described \\"on\\" 'obligations passively incurred'.

He was born at Ch√¢teau-Richer, Quebec in 1785. He studied at the Petit S√©minaire de Qu√©bec and later became a notary. During the War of 1812, he was a lieutenant in the Quebec City militia, later becoming captain. He represented Quebec County in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1833 to 1838. He supported the Ninety-Two Resolutions, but preferred working through legal channels to rebellion.

The security of the scheme is based on the computational Diffie‚ÄìHellman problem. Two incarnations of the IES are standardized: Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme (DLIES) and Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES), which is also known as the Elliptic Curve Augmented Encryption Scheme or simply the Elliptic Curve Encryption Scheme. These two incarnations are identical up to the change of an underlying group and so to be concrete we concentrate on the latter. Informal description As a brief and informal description and overview of how IES works, we use a Discrete Logarithm Integrated Encryption Scheme (DLIES) based example, focusing on illuminating the reader's understanding, rather than precise technical details. # Alice learns Bob's public key, g^x through a public key infrastructure or other pre-distributed method. We assume Bob knows his own private key x. # Alice generates a fresh, ephemeral value y, and its associated public value, g^y. # Alice then computes a symmetric key k using this information and a key derivation function KDF as follows: k = mathit{KDF}(g^{xy}). # Alice computes her ciphertext c from her actual message m, i.e. the symmetric encryption of m, encrypted under key k (using an authenticated encryption scheme) as follows: c = E(k; m). # Alice transmits (in a single message) both the public ephemeral g^y, and the ciphertext c. # Bob, knowing x and g^y, can now compute k = KDF(g^{xy}) and decrypt m from c. Note that the scheme does not provide Bob with any assurance as to who really sent the message: the scheme does nothing to stop anyone from pretending to be Alice. Formal description =Information required= To send an encrypted message to Bob using ECIES, Alice needs the following information: * cryptographic suite to be used, including a key derivation function (e.g., ANSI-X9.63-KDF with SHA-1 option), a message authentication code (e.g., HMAC- SHA-1-160 with 160-bit keys or HMAC-SHA-1-80 with 80-bit keys) and a symmetric encryption scheme (e.g., TDEA in CBC mode or XOR encryption scheme)‚Äînoted E; * elliptic curve domain parameters: (p,a,b,G,n,h) for a curve over a prime field or (m,f(x),a,b,G,n,h) for a curve over a binary field; * Bob's public key: K_B (Bob generates it as follows: K_B = k_B G, where k_B is the private key he chooses at random: k_B in [1, n-1]); * optional shared information: S_1 and S_2. * O denotes the point at infinity =Encryption= To encrypt a message m Alice does the following: # generates a random number r in [1, n-1] and calculates R = r G; # derives a shared secret: S = P_x, where P = (P_x, P_y) = r K_B (and P e O); # uses a KDF to derive symmetric encryption keys and MAC keys: k_E  k_M = textrm{KDF}(SS_1); # encrypts the message: c = E(k_E; m); # computes the tag of encrypted message and S_2: d = textrm{MAC}(k_M; c  S_2); # outputs R  c  d. =Decryption= To decrypt the ciphertext R  c  d Bob does the following: # derives the shared secret: S = P_x, where P = (P_x, P_y) = k_B R (it is the same as the one Alice derived because P = k_B R = k_B r G = r k_B G = r K_B), or outputs failed if P=O; # derives keys the same way as Alice did: k_E  k_M = textrm{KDF}(SS_1); # uses MAC to check the tag and outputs failed if d e textrm{MAC}(k_M; c  S_2); # uses symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt the message m = E^{-1}(k_E; c).

Domestic airports do not have customs and immigration facilities and so cannot handle flights to or from a foreign airport. These airports often have short runways sufficient to handle short or medium haul aircraft and regional air traffic. Security check / metal detectors are used in most countries, but in many cases they were installed decades after security checks for international flights had become commonplace. Most municipal airports in Canada and the United States are of this classification. At international airports in Canada, there are domestic terminals that handle flights within Canada (flying from one Canadian city to another). Additionally, some airports that are named \\"international\\" are essentially domestic airports that handles international traffic on an irregular basis. Many of these airports are located through the United States. In the United Kingdom, an example of a domestic airport is Wick Airport, which operates frequent flights to other Scottish airports. Some small countries or regions do not have any public domestic airports, or even public domestic flights, due to its size or political reasons, e.g. Belgium, Kuwait, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, and the United Arab Emirates.  Regional airport  A regional airport is an airport serving traffic within a relatively small or lightly populated geographical area. A regional airport usually does not have customs and immigration facilities to process traffic between countries. In Canada regional airports usually service connections within Canada and some flights to the United States. A few U.S. regional airports, some of which actually call themselves international airports, may have customs and immigration facilities staffed on an as-needed basis, but the vast majority serve domestic traffic only. Aircraft using these airports tend to be smaller business jets, private aircraft and regional airliners of both turboprop propelled or regional jetliner varieties. These flights usually go a shorter distance to a larger regional hub. These airports usually have shorter runways, which exclude heavy planes with much fuel. = Europe = In European countries, regional airports are often classed as airports that don't serve the country's capital/most major city. Examples of larger regional airports include Barcelona El Prat Airport, Spain and Manchester Airport, England, which are both among Europe's busiest airports and are used by both large and small planes. In countries like France, Germany, and Sweden, a regional airport is an airport for small planes, even though they go to the national hub, just like flights from larger airports. Examples of small regional airports include Coventry Airport and Worship Airport. In northern Norway, a country with long distances and many short-runway airports, regional airports are those with flights to a regional hub, not to the capital.

They typically contain facilities of both a civil airport and a military air base. By country = United States = The United States has several joint-use airports in Federal Aviation Administration records, where they are also described as shared-use airports. One example is Northwest Florida Regional Airport, which utilizes the runway and ATC services of Eglin Air Force Base. Charleston International Airport uses the runways and services of Charleston Air Force Base. Both civil airports, however, operate their own passenger terminals and taxiways. Charleston also has private fixed- base operators on the civilian side of the field catering to the general flying public. = Singapore = In Singapore, Changi Air Base shares runway facilities with Singapore Changi Airport, the country's main international airport.  Enclaves  In some cases, if one type of operations is considered the primary user or owner of the airport, the other user may sometimes be described as an enclave. = Civil enclave = A civil enclave is an area at a military air base allotted for the usage of civil aviation. Civil enclaves are common in countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan where a part of an air base, almost invariably a legacy of World War II vintage, is allotted for domestic air traffic instead of building a new civilian airport. These airports usually have a curfew (mostly after sunset) during which civil aircraft are not permitted to operate. Many reserve morning hours for military flight training. Some civil enclaves adopt an altitude restriction, i.e. one below which a civilian aircraft cannot descend while over-flying the enclave. The curfew system may result in airport congestion while the altitude restriction can cause long detours and greater fuel consumption. Air traffic control at civil enclaves is usually entrusted to the armed forces or it may be a joint civilian-military crew. In some countries security is the responsibility of military personnel; in others, civil security authorities such as the Transportation Security Administration in the United States retain responsibility for all civilian aviation security. It is generally accepted that the military receives revenues from civil use of ATC services if they own and operate them, but in some countries it is not clear as to whether capital expenditure for improvements such as runway expansion is the responsibility of the military or civilian authorities.http://www.indianairports.com/php/showNews.php?newsid=42&linkid;=51&PHPSESSID;=ee5a26d91b1d32254e607963414d9264 One example in India is Goa's Goa International Airport at Dabolim. =Military enclave= The obverse, a military enclave, is an area of a civil airport that is allocated for use by the military.

History In 1626, Samuel de Champlain established in Ch√¢teau-Richer the first farm in the Saint Lawrence valley, to feed the people of Quebec city. Jean Bourdon's map of 1641 is the earliest source that mentions the name \\"Chateau Richer\\", referring only to the cape or headland on which stands the present church. But the origin of this name remains uncertain. In 1646, Olivier Letardif, Lord and Chief Prosecutor, granted 20 concessions to the inhabitants of Ch√¢teau-Richer so that they could officially establish themselves properly. In 1678, the local parish was formed, named La Visitation-de-Notre-Dame. On March 15, 1753, Ch√¢teau-Richer became very first organized village in New France. In 1832, the post office opened. In 1845, the municipality was first established but abolished in 1847. It was reestablished in 1855 when it was incorporated as a parish municipality. Ch√¢teau-Richer was the county town of defunct Montmorency County.Montmorency ‚Äì Quebec History Louis-Th√©odore Besserer, a prominent businessman of Ottawa, was born in Ch√¢teau-Richer. In 1968, it changed statutes and became Ville de Ch√¢teau-Richer.

It has managed by Jones Lang LaSalle as of 2020. It is anchored by JCPenney, Kohl's, Target, Von Maur and Scheels Sporting Goods. History =The 1970s and 1980s= The mall was developed in 1976 by Homart Development Company and originally had wood and glass railings and an overall off-white and brown theme. The pillars in the mall were made of white pebbles. There was no elevator in the mall and originally the mall featured a large ramp for access to the second floor by wheelchair. The mall was designed with a sunken basement-level foodcourt. The mall featured the department stores Powers Dry Goods and Sears. Powers' store became Donaldson's in 1985, then Carson Pirie Scott in 1987. In 1984, a Target store was constructed adjacent to the mall and connected by a walkway. =The 1990s= The mall underwent a major renovation and the color scheme was changed to a pink and aqua pastel theme. The white pebble pillars were covered with pastel aqua round casings. The ramp was removed and replaced with a free standing elevator. The glass and wood railings were replaced with aqua painted metal. The food court was decorated with large neon palm trees and given a fountain that changed colors. In preparation of a $60 million renovation plan in 1996, the mall worked hard to lure premiere Minneapolis retailer Dayton'shttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/179022755/?terms=dayton%27s%20maplewood&match;=1; and it appeared to be a plan Dayton's was considering, though they eventually decided against it. The Carson Pirie Scott store became a Mervyns, and work began on adding a Kohl's department store. A second United Artists movie theater was built, called \\"Eden Prairie East\\" and the old theater located beneath the Target walkway was renamed \\"Eden Prairie West\\". The mall entrances at this time had large white pyramids. In June 1997, General Growth purchased the rest of the development that it did not already own from Homart. =Present day= The mall underwent the most major renovation in 2001. A new wing was added to the mall and the floor plan changed considerably to make the mall more modern and upscale. The food court was moved out of the recessed basement, which has been sealed in and now serves as the mall offices and other offices, changing the mall's store layout from a three-story mall to two stories. A large AMC movie theater was added to the mall and the two United Artists theatres have closed. The Target expanded into a Target Greatland and connected to the mall, replacing the old walkway. A Von Maur department store was added to the mall in August 2001, the mall entrance utilizing space that had been smaller mall stores near the old food court area. The mall has a simplified stylized \\"EP\\" logo to replace the older handwritten style logo, and the pastel theme disappeared in favor of wood and stonework. After the Mervyns store closed in August 2004, the owner of the mall acquired the store. Department Store Discounters had a brief stay in the Mervyn's location in 2005. JCPenney opened a new store in the former Mervyn's location in March 2007. The current department stores in the mall are JCPenney, Kohl's, Target, and Von Maur. In October 2013, General Growth Properties sold the mall to Cypress Equities for $99 million. Sears closed in 2016. The building was demolished and a 248,000 sq/ft Scheels All Sports opened in July 2020. On June 4, 2020, it was announced that JCPenney would be closing as part of a plan to close 154 stores nationwide. However that store was removed from the closing list and will remain open for now.https://www.marketwatch.com/story/these-are- the-154-stores-jc-penney-will-soon-close-2020-06-04 Film Appearances * The Kevin Smith movie Mallrats was filmed inside the Eden Prairie Center Mall in 1995. Smith decided to film the movie at the mall (which in the movie, is referred to by its actual name, but is supposed to be located in New Jersey) after various malls (including the Monmouth Mall in Eatontown, New Jersey, and the now closed Bannister Mall in Kansas City, Missouri) objected to content in the film, and refused to allow the production to be shot there. * The mockumentary Drop Dead Gorgeous has a scene filmed in the parking lot of the Eden Prairie Center, when they are allegedly parking in the parking lot of the nearby Mall of America; one of the 1990s era pyramid entrances is clearly visible in the background. * The mall reappears in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.

Its damaging trek began on August 23, 2005, when it originated as Tropical Depression Twelve near the Bahamas. The next day, the tropical depression strengthened to a tropical storm, and was named Katrina; it proceeded to make landfall on the southern tip of the U.S. state of Florida as a minimal hurricane. In passing across Florida, Katrina did not attain any more strength but did manage to maintain hurricane status. After passing over Florida, the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico allowed it to rapidly intensify to the sixth-strongest Atlantic hurricane in recorded history. Afterward, Katrina made landfall as a Category 3 storm near Buras- Triumph, Louisiana, and once more near the Mississippi/Louisiana border. Katrina progressed northward through the central United States and finally dissipated near the Great Lakes on August 31, when it was absorbed by a cold front. Formation Tropical Storm Katrina shortly after formation on August 24 over The Bahamas. On August 19, a tropical wave merged with the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten, the surface low of which had dissipated earlier due to the effects of a nearby upper tropospheric trough. On August 23, 2005, at 5:00 p.m. EDT (2100 UTC), this system developed into Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic indicate that the old name/number is retained when a depression dissipates and regenerates, satellite data indicated that a second tropical wave combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, much more advanced system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. Simultaneously, the trough in the upper storm weakened, causing the wind shear in the area to relax, thereby allowing the new tropical depression to develop. In a later re-analysis, it was determined that the low-level circulation of Ten had completely detached and dissipated, with only the remnant mid-level circulation moving on and merging with the aforementioned second tropical wave.

As the atmospheric conditions surrounding Tropical Depression Twelve were favorable for tropical development, the system began to intensify and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24. A burst of convection allowed Katrina to become the fifth hurricane of the 2005 season on August 25, only two hours before it made landfall around 6:30 p.m. EST (2230 UTC) between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida. Katrina struck the peninsula with winds, and had a well-defined eye on NEXRAD weather radar, which remained intact throughout its passage over Florida. Parts of the Florida Keys experienced tropical storm winds throughout August 26, with the Dry Tortugas briefly experiencing hurricane-force winds. Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Katrina near peak intensity in the Gulf of Mexico on August 28. The initial National Hurricane Center forecasts predicted that Katrina would begin turning northward after landfall, eventually to hit the Florida Panhandle approximately three to four days later. Katrina, however, continued a westerly and west-southwesterly track, which eventually shifted the forecast track westward to New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina's path over the Gulf of Mexico's exceptionally warm Loop Current. Immediately after the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico, the low wind shear, good upper-level outflow, and the warm sea surface temperatures of the Gulf Loop Current caused Katrina to intensify rapidly. On August 27, the storm was upgraded to Category 3 intensity, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification of maximum winds for about 18 hours, but almost doubled the radius of the storm. A second period of rapid intensification started by 7:00 p.m. CDT on August 27, and by 12:40 a.m. CDT on August 28, Katrina was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of . It became a Category 5 (the first in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Allen 25 years prior) storm by 7:00 a.m. CDT, twelve hours after the beginning of the second round of rapid intensification, and reached its peak intensity at 1:00 p.m. CDT with maximum sustained winds of , gusts of and a central pressure of 902 millibars. The minimum pressure made Katrina, at the time, the fourth-most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (Hurricanes Rita and Wilma would later surpass Katrina that same year). As the hurricane approached New Orleans, the Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana issued two strongly worded warnings of the storm's danger. By the afternoon of August 28, the storm was large enough that some areas of the Gulf Coast were already experiencing tropical storm-force winds. The center of Katrina was about 180 statute miles (290 km) from the mouth of the Mississippi River, but tropical storm-force winds extended from the center of the storm, and hurricane-force winds extended about 105 miles (170 km) away. Overnight on August 29, and into the morning of the next day, Katrina quickly weakened (in terms of maximum sustained winds) as it began to enter another eyewall replacement cycle. The inner eyewall deteriorated before an outer eyewall had fully formed, playing an important role in the weakening. In 18 hours, the hurricane's maximum sustained winds decreased from to . However, storm surge remained high at landfall because large waves greater than in height were generated beforehand (with a buoy recording a wave at sea), when Katrina was at Categories 4 and 5 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. The waves then combined with the storm surge of the large Category 3 hurricane. Second and third landfalls Satellite imagery of Hurricane Katrina making landfall. Katrina made its second landfall at 6:10 a.m. CDT on August 29 as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. Because Katrina had just weakened from Category 4 and due to the shape of the coastline, sustained Category 4 winds likely existed on land while the eye was over water. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended from the center, the storm's pressure was , and its forward speed was . As it made its way up the eastern Louisiana coastline, most communities in Plaquemines, St. Bernard Parish, and Slidell in St. Tammany Parish were severely damaged by storm surge and the strong winds of the eyewall, which also grazed eastern New Orleans, causing in excess of $1 billion worth of damage to the city (see Effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans). Original estimates indicated that Katrina had made this landfall as a Category 4 hurricane, with winds; however, as indicated above, the storm weakened just before landfall to Category 3 intensity. The reasons for this weakening are not completely understood; while the eye-wall replacement cycle played a part, slightly increasing shear, dropping sea-surface temperatures, dry air on the western semicircle of the storm, and interaction with the continental landmass also may have played a role in weakening the cyclone. This follows the trend of previous strong cyclones in the Gulf of Mexico: most cyclones with minimum central pressures of or less have weakened over the 12 hours before making landfall in the Gulf Coast of the United States. Radar image of Hurricane Katrina making its second and third landfalls. A few hours later, after weakening slightly, Katrina made its third landfall near the Louisiana‚ÄìMississippi border with sustained winds and pressure, still at Category 3 intensity. Its minimum pressure at its second landfall was , making Katrina the fourth-strongest hurricane on record to make landfall on the United States, behind Hurricane Michael's 919-millibar (27.138 inHg) reading, Hurricane Camille's reading in 1969, and the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane's record. Because the storm was so large, highly destructive eye-wall winds and the strong northeastern quadrant of the storm pushed record storm surges onshore, smashing the entire Mississippi Gulf Coast, including towns in Mississippi such as Waveland, Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, Long Beach, Gulfport, Biloxi, Ocean Springs, Gautier and Pascagoula, and, in Alabama, Bayou La Batre. The surges peaked at in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, and at as far away as Mobile, Alabama, which saw its highest storm surge since 1917. Storm surge was particularly high due to the hydrology of the region, the hurricane's extreme size, and the fact that it weakened only shortly before landfall. As Katrina moved inland diagonally over Mississippi, high winds cut a swath of damage that affected almost the entire state. Hurricane Katrina following its third landfall, but still at hurricane strength, over southern Mississippi Demise Katrina maintained hurricane strength well into Mississippi, but weakened thereafter, losing hurricane strength more than inland, near Meridian, Mississippi. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee and broke in half. One half continued to race northward, affecting the Central United States along its path, and was last distinguishable in the eastern Great Lakes region on August 31. On August 31, Katrina merged with a frontal boundary and became a powerful extratropical low, causing of rain in 12 hours, as well as gale-force wind gusts from in southeastern Quebec and northern New Brunswick. In the region of Saguenay and C√¥te-Nord, rain caused breakdowns and failure in roads. The C√¥te-Nord region was isolated from the rest of Quebec for at least 1 week. The other half of Katrina broke off in the eastern part of the Appalachians, primarily leading to a significant tornado outbreak in the area from central Georgia to central Pennsylvania, killing two people and causing millions of dollars in additional damage. At 11:00 p.m. EDT on August 31, the center of the remnant low of what was Katrina had been completely absorbed by a frontal boundary in southeastern Canada, with no discernible circulation.

The Hindu scriptures narrate various occasions when gods have performed the Tandava. The Bhagavata Purana talks of Krishna dancing his Tandava on the head of the serpent Kaliya. When Sati (first wife of Shiva, who was reborn as Parvati) jumped into the Agni Kunda (sacrificial fire) in Daksha's Yajna and gave up her life, Shiva is said to have performed the Rudra Tandava to express his grief and anger. Ganesha, the son of Shiva, is depicted as Ashtabhuja tandavsa nritya murtis (Eight armed form of Ganesha dancing the Tandava) in temple sculptures. According to Jain traditions, Indra is said to have performed the Tandava in honour of Rishabha (Jain tirthankar) on the latter's birth. Hinduism Tandava, as performed in the sacred dance-drama of India, has vigorous, brisk movements. Performed with joy, the dance is called Ananda Tandava. Performed in a violent mood, the dance is called Raudra or Rudra Tandava. The types of Tandava found in the Hindu texts are: Ananda Tandava, Tripura Tandava, Sandhya Tandava, Samhara Tandava, Kali (Kalika) Tandava, Uma Tandava, Shiva Tandava, Krishna Tandava and Gauri Tandava. =Krishna Tandava= KƒÅliya and his wives Naginis asking Krishna for his mercy. From a Bhagavata Purana manuscript, c. 1640. According to Bhagavata Purana, Krishna danced on the hood of Kaliya, the serpent, subjugating him and cleansed the river Yamuna of its impurities. This episode describing the destruction of the venomous snake Kaliya, who was a menace to the people of Braj, is very popularly rendered as Krishna Tandava or Krishna's Tandava dance. Author Angana Jhaveri describes Krishna Tandava in the Raslila has very spritely and joyful dance movements. It involves small quick movements, light springly jumps, fast footwork, spinning at a dizzy speed and some acrobatic movements. But the overall effect of the form is that of grace and delicacy suitable to the romantic and youthful character of Krishna. Worship of Krishna as the \\"God of dance\\" is prevalent even before 16th centrury. Author and Professor Caleb Simmons in his book Devotional Sovereignty: Kingship and Religion in India says that, King Chikka Devaraja (the fourteenth maharaja of the Kingdom of Mysore) mindted a series of Gold coins called \\"Devaraja [with] the image of dancing Krishna\\" (tandava krishnamurti devaraja) to commemorate his coronation. Author Sehdev Kumar in his book A Thousand Petalled Lotus: Jain Temples of Rajasthan : Architecture & Iconography says that, Before 12th and 13th centuries, during the Chola period, Nataraja dancing and the Krishna dancing the tandava on the hood of hundred headed serpent kaliya, were favourite subjects for the artists. Scholar Lavanya Vemsani says, \\"Bharatanatyam and Kuchipudi developed a style of dance known as Tandava, a set of vigorous dance moves mainly performed with brisk movements of the feet, which was once said to have been performed by the child Krishna while he deafeated the sepant Kaliya in Kalind lake in Brindavan\\". There are many composition where Krishna's Nritya (dance) is beautifully depicted. Purandara Dasa designates \\"Natya Krishna\\" also as \\"Tandava Krishna\\". Purandara Dasa in one of his compositions says, \\"Tandava krishnana bhajisi \\" (\\"Pray to Tandava Krishna\\"). Due to this reference we can note that 'tandava' also means a form of Nritya (dance) practised by Krishna and others. =Shiva tandava & Shaivism= A Shiva Natarajan idol in Tamil Nadu, India According to Shaivism, Shiva's Tandava is described as a vigorous dance that is the source of the cycle of creation, preservation and dissolution. While the Rudra Tandava depicts his violent nature, first as the creator and later as the destroyer of the universe, even of death itself, the Ananda Tandava depicts him as joyful. In Shaiva Siddhanta tradition, Shiva as Nataraja (lit. \\"King of dance\\") is considered to be supreme lord of dance. \\"Nataraja\\", Manas, UCLA The Tandavam takes its name from Tandu (), the attendant of Shiva, who instructed Bharata (author of the Natya Shastra) in the use of Angaharas and KaranasNatya-shastra IV.263-264 modes of the Tandava at Shiva's order. Some scholars consider that Tandu himself must have been the author of an earlier work on the dramatic arts, which was incorporated into the Natya Shastra.Quarterly Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society, part III, pp. 25-26, as cited in Indeed, the classical arts of dance, music and song may derive from the mudras and rituals of Shaiva tradition. The 32 Angaharas and 108 Karanas are discussed by Bharata in the 4th chapter of the Natya Shastra, Tandava Lakshanam.Ragini Devi, Dance Dialects of India, pp.29-30. Motilal Banarsidass (1990) Karana is the combination of hand gestures with feet to form a dance posture. Angahara is composed of seven or more Karanas. > \\"How many various dances of Shiva are known to His worshipers I cannot say. > No doubt the root idea behind all of these dances is more or less one and > the same, the manifestation of primal rhythmic energy.

(New York: Noonday Press, (1957) . Cited, \\"Nataraja\\", > Manas, UCLA The dance performed by Shiva's wife Parvati in response to Shiva's Tandava is known as Lasya, in which the movements are gentle, graceful and sometimes erotic. Some scholars consider Lasya to be the feminine version of Tandava. Lasya has 2 kinds, Jarita Lasya and Yauvaka Lasya. Shiva Tandava Stotram is a stotra (Hindu hymn) that describes Shiva's power and beauty. Indian classical dance In Kathak dance three types of Tandavas are generally used, they are, Krishna Tandava, Shiva Tandava and Ravana Tandava, but sometimes a fourth variety - Kalika Tandava, is also often used. The Manipuri dance is categorized as either \\"Tandava\\" (vigorous, usually go with Shiva, Shakti or Krishna as warrior-savior themed plays) or lasya (delicate, usually go with love stories of Radha and Krishna).

During the 1960s, he played in a number of Welsh bands, including Commancheros, The Smokeless Zone, Dream and Plum Crazy, before joining Dave Edmunds' band Love Sculpture.\\"Mannerisms II ‚Äì Man and roots/offshoots\\" by Michael Mycock, published June 1995, page 108 In 1970 he joined the Welsh rock group Man, which included two former Dream and Smokeless Zone members, Deke Leonard and Martin Ace. With Man, he originally appeared on 7 Studio albums, 3 Live albums and 2 Various artists, live albums, and has subsequently appeared on a number of retrospective releases. When Man split in 1976, Williams re-joined Edmunds in the band Rockpile with Nick Lowe and Billy Bremner, and continued working with Leonard. Between 1981 and 1982, Williams was part of the Neverland Express band, backing Meat Loaf. In November 1982 Williams joined Dire Straits as the replacement for drummer Pick Withers, shortly after the release of their fourth studio album Love Over Gold. Williams played with them for the first time on the 1983 EP titled ExtendedancEPlay (featuring the hit single ‚ÄúTwisting by the Pool‚Äù) and on the 1982‚Äì1983 Love over Gold Tour. The band's double live album Alchemy: Dire Straits Live was a recording of excerpts from the final two concerts from that tour at London's Hammersmith Odeon in July 1983, featuring Williams, and was released in March 1984. In 1983 Dire Straits frontman Mark Knopfler wrote and produced the music score for the film Local Hero, which also featured Williams. Williams remained with Dire Straits for the recording of their fifth studio album, 1985's Brothers in Arms, however according to a Sound on Sound magazine interview his drumming performance was considered to be unsuitable for the desired sound of the album during the first month of the recording sessions, and he was temporarily replaced by jazz session drummer Omar Hakim, who re-recorded the album's drum parts during a two-day stay and then left.CLASSIC TRACKS: Dire Straits 'Money For Nothing'. soundonsound.com Both Hakim and Williams are credited on the album, although Williams' only contributions were the improvised crescendo at the beginning of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and the whole song Walk of Life.

Williams left Dire Straits in 1989. One of his final concerts with the band was the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert staged on 11 June 1988 at Wembley Stadium, in which Dire Straits were the headline act. In 1996, Williams briefly rejoined Man, after John Weathers left, but left the following year. Williams ran a blues club in Swansea from 2000 until 2007. Discography ;With Billy Bremner * Bash!

It was the last book Tey published in her lifetime, shortly before her death. In 1990 it was voted number one in The Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list compiled by the British Crime Writers' Association. In 1995 it was voted number four in The Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time list compiled by the Mystery Writers of America. Plot summary Alan Grant, Scotland Yard Inspector (a character who also appears in five other novels by the same author) is feeling bored while confined to bed in hospital with a broken leg. Marta Hallard, an actress friend of his, suggests that he should amuse himself by researching a historical mystery. She brings him some pictures of historical characters, aware of Grant's interest in human faces. He becomes intrigued by a portrait of King Richard III. He prides himself on being able to read a person's character from his appearance, and King Richard seems to him a gentle, kind and wise man. Why is everyone so sure that he was a cruel murderer? With the help of other friends and acquaintances, Grant investigates Richard's life and the case of the Princes in the Tower, testing out his theories on the doctors and nurses who attend to him. Grant spends weeks pondering historical information and documents with the help of Brent Carradine, a likable young American researcher working in the British Museum. Using his detective's logic, he comes to the conclusion that the claim of Richard being a murderer is a fabrication of Tudor propaganda, as is the popular image of the King as a monstrous hunchback. Themes and arguments The book explores how history is constructed, and how certain versions of events come to be widely accepted as the truth, despite a lack of evidence and/or any logical plausibility. Grant comes to understand the ways that great myths or urban legends are constructed, and how in this case, the victorious Tudors saw to it that their version of history prevailed. The novel's title is taken from an old proverb (\\"Truth is the daughter of time\\") which is quoted by Tey as the novel's epigraph. Like all aphorisms this proverb has been directly quoted, paraphrased or enhanced many times over the centuries by multiple famous literate thinkers such as Aulus Gellius and Abraham Lincoln (direct quotes); Sir Francis Bacon (enhanced quote: \\"Truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.\\"); and Thales (paraphrase: \\"It is time that has discovered, or in due course will discover, all things that lie hidden.\\") to name just a few. The novel also explores and pastiches different types of historical writing. In his research, Grant starts with children's history books, then moves on to general popular histories and the very scholarly but dull \\"Tanner's Constitutional History of England\\". He also reads Thomas More's History of King Richard III and a historical novel called The Rose of Raby by \\"Evelyn Payne-Ellis\\", about the life of Richard's mother Cecily Neville. Both Tanner's history and the novel are non-existent; it has been suggested that the title of the latter is derived from Guy Paget's 1937 biography of the same name.Toby Malone, \\" \\"A Dog, a Rat, ... a Cat to Scratch a Man to Death!\\": Olivier's Richard III and Popular Cultures\\", Literature/Film Quarterly, Vol. 37, No. 2 Other alleged historical myths touched upon by the author are the commonly believed (but false) story that troops fired on the public at the 1910 Tonypandy Riot, the traditional depiction of the Boston Massacre, the martyrdom of Margaret Wilson and the life and death of Mary, Queen of Scots. Grant adopts the term \\"Tonypandy\\" to describe widely believed historical myths, such as the supposed shootings at the Tonypandy Riots and believes popular accounts of Richard's activities to fall into this category. This line of thought reflects a dislike and distrust of emotional popular narratives concerning supposed historical injustices which also surfaces in Tey's other works. Grant's case for the innocence of Richard III Late 16C portrait of Richard III (National Portrait Gallery, London), copied from an early 16C one in the Royal Collections. A reproduction of this version is kept by Grant at his bedside. In this novel, as in her other works such as The Franchise Affair and Miss Pym Disposes, Josephine Tey relies partially on physiognomy as a means of determining an initial assessment of a person's character. Grant's first impetus towards an intellectual investigation of whether Richard III really had the two main heirs to his dead brother's throne callously murdered in the Tower of London is his early certainty that Richard's face could not possibly be that of someone who would perform such a base crime as the cold- blooded murder of his two young nephews. However, this is just an initial 'gut feel'; the original spark that makes Grant want to know more about (and thus ultimately research and investigate) the true character and background of Richard III rather than any of the other historical personae of whom his friend Marta Hallard has provided him with images (in order to alleviate his bed-ridden boredom). The subsequent police-like investigation that Grant undertakes during the remainder of the novel in order to find some circumstantial evidence that Richard (or anyone else) disposed of the princes reveals that there never was a Bill of Attainder, Coroner's inquest, or any other legal proceeding that contemporaneously accused ‚Äì much less convicted ‚Äì Richard III of any foul play against the Princes in the Tower. It also points out that the princes were not reported missing by anyone until after the Battle of Bosworth Field, by which time Richard was dead and the princes were now in Henry VII's custody in the Tower. Grant comes to the conclusion that Henry is a much more likely perpetrator of the dual regicide than Richard when the question of 'who instigated the killing of the princes?' is approached from the traditional crime detection perspective of means, motive and opportunity ‚Äì particularly motive. Tey's pro-Richard arguments repeat some of those made in Clements Markham's 1906 book Richard III: his life & character, reviewed in the light of recent research.R. Gordon Kelly, \\"Josephine Tey and Others: The Case of Richard III\\", in Ray B. Browne, Lawrence A. Kreiser, Jr, et al. (eds.) The Detective as Historian: History and Art in Historical Crime Fiction, Volume 1, Popular Press, 2000, p.134. The main arguments presented in the book in defence of King Richard: * There was no political advantage for Richard III in killing the young princes. With Titulus Regius enacted, the two princes represented no threat to Richard once he was crowned king. * The two princes were more of a threat to Henry VII as the foundation of his Tudor claim to the crown was significantly less good than theirs * Although a Bill of Attainder was brought by Henry VII against Richard after the battle of Bosworth it made no mention of the princes' disappearance from the Tower, suggesting that at the time the Attainder was presented to Parliament the princes were not yet missing. * The Bill of Attainder that Henry and his supportive magnates did subsequently file against the deceased Richard merely accuses him generically of \\"cruelty and tyranny\\" during his reign ‚Äì there is no specific accusation, nor even a mention, in it of Richard's suspected complicity in the princes' disappearance / assumed deaths. * The mother of the princes, Elizabeth Woodville, remained on genuinely good terms with Richard once he was king, and her daughters regularly took part in social events at his court. Grant observes that this was hardly the behaviour of a mother who believed, or even just suspected, that Richard had ordered the deaths of both her young sons. * There is no contemporary recorded evidence that the princes were missing from the Tower before Henry VII took over custody of them. It is only at that juncture that the rumours and speculative accusations start to be recorded in historical documents. Grant and his American collaborator argue that there is little evidence of resistance to Richard's rule (ignoring Buckingham's rebellion). They allow that there were rumours of his murdering the princes during his lifetime, but they decide that the rumours had little circulation, and attribute them to the Croyland Chronicle and to the Lord Chancellor of France, and ultimately to Tudor sympathiser John Morton. They also propose that Morton was the actual author of Thomas More's biography of Richard, suggesting that the incomplete manuscript found after More's death was an unfinished copy by More of Morton's lost original. They conclude that the princes probably remained alive throughout Richard's reign and were later killed by Henry. Literary significance and criticism On its publication Anthony Boucher called the book \\"one of the permanent classics in the detective field.... one of the best, not of the year, but of all time\\". Dorothy B. Hughes also praised it, saying it is \\"not only one of the most important mysteries of the year, but of all years of mystery\\".Roseman, Mill et al., Detectionary. New York: Overlook Press, 1971. The novel is listed as number one on the CWA's Top 100 Crime Novels of All Time list and number four on the MWA's Top 100 Mystery Novels of All Time list. Winston Churchill stated in his History of the English-Speaking PeoplesChurchill, History of the English-Speaking Peoples, vol 1, p486 his belief in Richard's guilt of the murder of the princes, adding, \\"It will take many ingenious books to raise the issue to the dignity of a historical controversy\\", probably referring to Tey's novel, published seven years earlier.

The ranch was established in 1878 with an initial purchase of 160 acres south of the Union Pacific tracks by William (Buffalo Bill) Cody. The 4,000 acre ranch was sold in 1911 and has been under the management of the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission since 1964. The 25 acre historic state park, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, is open weekdays from April to October. The house and outbuildings can be toured, including a museum documenting Cody's life from a Pony Express rider to his Wild West shows. Founding of the Cody-North Ranch In 1877 Cody contacted Major Frank North, the leader of the Pawnee Scouts, who was living in Sidney, Nebraska. Cody founded the Cody- North Partnership with the North brothers to form a cattle business. North found land along the Dismal River, 65 miles north of North Platte, on which cattle could graze and a ranch could be built. Cody continued touring his ‚ÄúBuffalo Bill‚Äôs Wild West‚Äù show while North purchased cattle at the north end of the Texas cattle trail, near Ogallala, Nebraska. North hired cowboys to help operate the ranch while Cody was on tour. The ranch grew in size to encompass seven thousand acres. 2,500 acres were planted for alfalfa and 2,500 were corn. The Omaha Bee reported on Cody's ranching operations several times. The Bee described the ranch as one of the most improved farms in Nebraska. In cooperation with Isaac Dillon, a neighboring rancher, Cody and Dillon built a 12-mile irrigation ditch, capable of watering 6,000 acres of crops. This property was financially viable for Cody. By the 1880s, however, other homesteaders had begun to move into this area of Nebraska and had taken grazing land. In 1882 the Cody-North Ranching Operation ended and was bought out by John Bratt.  Founding of Cody Ranch (\\"Scout's Rest Ranch\\")  During the time of owning the Cody-North Ranch, in 1878, Cody began buying land surrounding North Platte. The first purchase of land was 160 acres for $750, south of the Union Pacific tracks that run through North Platte. Cody purchased nearly 4,000 more acres adjacent to North Platte. An eighteen-room mansion on the property which was a treeless prairie. Cody had land in Kansas that had many tall, established trees and wanted trees on his new ranch. Al Goodman, his brother-in-law, discovered why trees would not grow on his new property or the North Platte area. Goodman found issues of water absorption and planted many cottonwoods and box-elder around the property, able to withstand the conditions. The ranch now had many growing trees. This information was shared with the people of North Platte to increase tree population in the area. Barn, view to the north Louisa (Cody's wife) and their daughters moved to North Platte in February 1878. They monitored the property, where Cody wanted to retire. Cody showed his new land and brought out family, friends, and celebrities. These guests, along with his family, spent time with the cowboys employed on the ranch. The ranch grew with the help of the Goodmans, who maintained the ranch and managed the high-grade livestock and thoroughbred horses. By 1885, 1,200 acres were planted as corn, 100 acres of alfalfa, 50 of broomcorn, and a small oat field. The ranch was operated with 80 horses and 30 men, rising to 60 men in busy seasons. When the trees grew, the southern portion of the ranch turned into a wooded park with deer, several young buffaloes, and a large lake. This area of land would be called ‚ÄúScout‚Äôs Rest Ranch‚Äù. Cody had the words ‚ÄúScout‚Äôs Rest Ranch‚Äù painted on the roof of the large barn, so that it could be read from the Union Pacific tracks a mile away. This ranch was revolutionary for the time. Cody imported many blooded cattle and thoroughbred horses at a time when that was not common. The land was transformed from treeless prairie to a forested area. Despite advancements and profitable years, operating costs were high and Cody sold the ranch in 1911 for $100,000.  Modern History  Cody House, view to the northwest The original two-story house was built in 1886 for Al and Julia Goodman. Al and Julia Goodman are Cody's sister and brother-in-law who managed the ranch. This house was built by Patrick Walsh, a native of North Platte, for $3,900. In 1964 the house was purchased by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission as part of the process for making Scout's Rest Ranch a State Historical Park, Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park. A Lincoln County Historical Society was organized to help raise money for the purchase of Buffalo Bill Cody's house. The group raised $37,500 and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission to cover the other $75,000 required for the purchase. Another $90,000 was planned to be spent on restoring the grounds and buildings. Since 1964, the State Historical Park has been open to the public. = Park Information = thumb Map of Scout's Rest Ranch Historic Buildings The Buffalo Bill Ranch State Historical Park is 25 acres and contains 4 original structures.

After the war, Wilks continued working with gas turbine engines, leading to Rover unveiling the first gas turbine powered car in 1949. Land Rover Series I Shortly after the war, whilst at his farm in Anglesey, Wilks, who used an army surplus Willys Jeep for farm work, and his brother Spencer who was visiting him, were inspired to develop and produce a utility four-wheel-drive vehicle for farmers, and the name Land Rover was coined for it. By the summer of 1947 Rover had built a prototype Land Rover vehicle based on a Jeep chassis. In September 1947, the Rover company authorised the production of 50 pre- production models for evaluation purposes. The Land Rover was launched to the world at the 1948 Amsterdam Motor Show.

The society consists of 41 animal shelters around New Zealand, including many in rural areas. Under the Animal Welfare Act 1999, SPCA inspectors have the exclusive power to investigate animal welfare complaints and prosecute abusers when necessary. The Royal NZ SPCA has initiated a range of animal welfare campaigns. It has launched public education campaigns about the humane treatment of animals, and has encouraged people to change their behaviour towards animals. SPCA has also run politically motivated campaigns aimed at promoting law changes or questioning the legality of certain practices. A 2007 Reader's Digest ranked the SPCA as the second most trusted charity, behind the Cancer Society. History The New Zealand SPCA was formed by settlers from England in 1882, inspired by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in England which was formed in 1824 after the passing of the Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822 and which lobbied for the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. This law was later replaced by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, a law which the settlers brought with them during the colonisation of New Zealand. The English society received royal patronage in 1840. The New Zealand society first formed in Dunedin, and was followed by the establishment of the Auckland and Wellington branches in 1883 and 1884 respectively. From this point onwards, smaller communities began to establish their own branches of the society. In 1933 the separate local societies joined together to form the national New Zealand Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. There are now 47 individual branches across New Zealand. In 2008 the society celebrated 125 years of continued service with a march up Queen Street in Auckland. On 17 June 2017, SPCA delegates voted to form one national organisation from 41 of its independent centres to create a unified and future-focused national entity. This change came into effect on 1 November 2017. Campaigns =Agricultural and entertainment animals= The group has also been involved in campaigns against alleged mistreatment of livestock. This includes campaigns against battery hens and pregnant sow pigs kept in \\"sow stalls\\" for up to 16 weeks without being able to move or turn around. Individual branches of the group have also been involved in unofficial campaigns, not directly recognised by the national body. A successful campaign by the Auckland arm of the organisation seen an end to rodeos at the Auckland Easter Show. There has also been moves to have rodeos outlawed altogether. =Domestic pets= The charity group has collaborated with the New Zealand Veterinary Association on a campaign against the tail docking of dogs. The SPCA claimed tail docking was an outdated and cosmetic practice which offered no benefits but causes unnecessary pain to the animal. The New Zealand Kennel Club purported there was no scientific evidence to support any of the SPCA's claims and said tail docking should be up to owners' preference. No decision was ever passed into law. In late 2012 an SPCA campaign which involved teaching dogs was featured on TV3 current affairs show Campbell Live. The campaign received international attention, and was covered by The Guardian, BBC News, Metro UK, Huffington Post, and the Financial Times. =Family violence= The SPCA also works in conjunction with the New Zealand Department of Child, Youth and Family Services to ensure that in households where animal abuse is occurring, possible indications of child abuse are looked into and in return where child abuse is found to be occurring, animals are looked into for possible maltreatment. The Society's One of the family empathy education programme was started in 2007, backed by New Zealand celebrity Norm Hewitt, in response to research indicating that a large percentage of criminals begin abusing animals in early life. One of the SPCA's recurring campaigns is an annual \\"List of Shame\\", exemplifying the worst cases of animal abuse in New Zealand. The list is designed to bring public awareness to the abuse of animals and to alert the public to the close link between animal cruelty and domestic and family violence.  Funding  The SPCA receives almost no government funding to run its campaigns and programmes, and relies on fundraising campaigns, public donations and bequests for its operational income. In 2010, the Society was granted $1.2 million from the Ministry for Primary Industries (New Zealand) to deal with animal welfare cases involving large-scale farming operations, to be split over four years. The organisation's main sponsors are Purina and Southern Cross Pet Insurance. Fines for animal welfare abuse prosecution are often directed to be paid to the SPCA, and the society often seeks the cost of food and veterinary bills from offenders during legal proceedings. The SPCA also has partnerships with various New Zealand businesses to generate funding. For example, pet store chain Animates has encouraged customers to make a donation to the SPCA in return for an ornament that they can hang on an in-store Christmas tree.

It was opened on 11 October 1997 when the line was constructed from Dinas.  History  The railway between Caernarfon and Dinas was formerly part of the standard gauge Carnarvonshire Railway, later LNWR and LMS,Conolly (1967) page 19Jowett (1989) between Caernarfon and Afon Wen, which was closed by British Railways in December 1964, and the tracks lifted. Northwards of the present Caernarfon station, the former standard gauge line ran through a tunnel, which is now used by a public road, to the site of the original Caernarvon railway station. The LNWR was under an obligation to build a station on this site (below Segontium Terrace), however the town corporation waived its claim to this station.Rear (1996) The original line continued on to a junction with the Chester and Holyhead Railway just south of the Britannia Bridge, terminating at the now-demolished Menai Bridge station.Disused Stations: Menai Bridge  Opening  The present station is sited on the former standard gauge trackbed adjacent to St. Helen's Road, opposite the former locomotive works of De Winton & Co and beneath the high retaining walls of Segontium Terrace, which can be reached from St Helen's Road via a pedestrian footbridge. The station buildings accommodate the booking office, a tourist shop and passenger facilities. In the winter of 2005/06 the passenger platform and run around loop at Caernarfon were lengthened to permit the operation of trains up to 10 carriages long. The narrow gauge line was built from Dinas to Caernarfon in 1997, thus providing the extension to Caernarfon of the Welsh Highland Railway that was originally authorised by Act of Parliament, but never built. Between Caernarfon and Dinas, the new Welsh Highland line shares the old standard gauge trackbed with the 'L√¥n Eifion' tourist cycle track.

Opened in 1950 and primarily used for high school football, it is located in the northwest part of the city, just east of the Spokane River. History The stadium is located on the former site of the Baxter hospital reservation of the U.S. Army. Built in less than four months in 1950, it opened as \\"Spokane Memorial Stadium\\" on September 15 with high school football. The name was selected through a newspaper contest and adopted by the city council in July. Its original grass field was taken from the lush sod of the parade grounds at historic Fort George Wright, south of the stadium. The lighted venue had a seating capacity of 25,000 but did not have a running track; city track and field continued at Hart Field in south Spokane. High school football was previously played at wooden Gonzaga Stadium, until it was deemed unsafe after the 1947 season. For the next two seasons, the high schools played at Ferris Field, a minor league ballpark just west of the Playfair horse track. On Saturday, November 25, 1950, Memorial Stadium was officially presented to the city by attorney Joseph A. Albi, leader of the Athletic Round Table (ART), and dedicated by Governor Arthur Langlie. The ceremonies were prior to the kickoff of the Washington‚ÄìWashington State football game (now known as the Apple Cup). The rivalry game had been absent from the city for forty years, last played in Spokane in 1910. The first manager of the stadium was Fred Bohler, the former coach and athletic director at Washington State College in Pullman. In 1954, it was considered as a potential minor league baseball venue; Indians Stadium (now Avista Stadium) opened in 1958. Memorial Stadium was renamed in the spring of 1962 for Albi (1892-1962), a local sports booster who led the efforts to fund and construct it. A bronze statue of Albi was unveiled in 1997 at the stadium. Seated several rows above the field in the southwest corner bleachers, the statue is often adorned in the school colors of competing teams. Albi and his wife Mazie are buried at Fairmount Memorial Park, adjacent to the west side of the stadium. In the summer of 1962, the field level was lowered by and 7,000 seats were added. AstroTurf was first installed in 1970, and was replaced with SuperTurf in 1979, and 1984. The playing surface was altered for professional soccer in 1996, essentially undoing the lowering project of 1962. The field level was raised 6¬Ω feet (2 m) and the width of the new artificial turf was extended to , formerly at , and seating was removed. The field was changed a decade later to infilled FieldTurf in 2006. The stadium has a current seating capacity of 28,646, and the playing field runs in the traditional north-south configuration at an elevation of above sea level.Topographic map & aerial photo from USGS via Microsoft Research Maps Located at the top of the west grandstand; the press box was rebuilt in 1978. =Modern use and potential replacement= The stadium is used extensively for high school football and marching band competitions. The former mayor of Spokane, the late Jim West, proposed to sell Joe Albi to a real estate developer interested in demolishing the stadium and turning it into a housing development. After a back and forth struggle, plans to raze the stadium were scrapped. Amid the debate about what to do with the aging stadium, an issue about its artificial turf surfaced. As a result of the turf being beyond its useful life in early 2006 and deemed unsafe, the Spokane Shadow discontinued its usage of Joe Albi Stadium, citing that the playing surface was too dangerous for PDL soccer games. As a consequence, the PDL terminated the Shadow's membership. A short time later, the playing surface dilemma was solved when the Spokane and Mead school districts agreed to share the cost of replacing the tired AstroTurf with infilled FieldTurf, which was installed in August 2006 for under $700,000. The investment by the two school districts ensures that Joe Albi will endure for at least the life of the new FieldTurf, estimated to be about a decade. In 2011, professional soccer returned to Spokane with the Spokane Shine calling the stadium home. In 2017, the school district announced that it was exploring options to replace Albi Stadium with a smaller, 5,000-seat facility in downtown that would host a professional United Soccer League team. The Albi Stadium site would be used for new sports fields. An advisory vote in November 2018 approved development of the stadium project, which was funded as part of a $495 million capital bond for the school district approved in the same election.

In 1970 and 1971, the Cougars played their entire home schedule at Joe Albi, after the south grandstand at the wooden Rogers Field stadium on the Pullman campus was damaged by fire in April 1970. The neighboring Idaho Vandals played their home games at Rogers Field in 1969 & 1970 (after the fire), as its wooden Neale Stadium in Moscow had been condemned during the summer of 1969. On September 19, 1970, WSU and Idaho met up in their annual \\"Battle of the Palouse,\\" which became known as the \\"Displaced Bowl\\" (since neither team was able to play on their home field); the Cougars dominated the second half (38‚Äì0) to win 44‚Äì16 at Joe Albi in their only victory of the season.

They both originated from the earwax in God Vishnu's ears while he was in the meditative deep sleep state of Yoganidra. From his navel, a lotus sprouted on which Brahma, the creator, was found sitting and contemplating the creation of the cosmos. Bhagavata Purana states that during the creation, the demons Madhu and Kaitabha stole the Vedas from Brahma and deposited them deep inside the waters of the primeval ocean. Vishnu, in his manifestation as Hayagriva, killed them, and retrieved the Vedas. The bodies of Madhu and Kaitabha disintegrated into 2 times 6 -- which is twelve pieces (two heads, two torsos, four arms and four legs). These are considered to represent the twelve seismic plates of the Earth. According to another legend, Madhu and Kaitabha were two demons who had become powerful enough to annihilate Brahma. However, Brahma spotted them and beseeched goddess Mahamaya for help. At this point, Vishnu awoke and the two conspiring demons were killed. This led to Vishnu being called Madhusudanah - the killer of Madhu, and Mahamaya came to be According to Devi Bhagavata Purana, Madhu and Kaitabha originated from Lord Vishnu's earwax and performed a long period of tapas devoted to goddess Mahadevi. The goddess granted them the boons of invincibility and voluntary death. The proud-filled demons then started attacking Brahma. Brahma sought Vishnu's help but was unable to awaken Vishnu who was still in deep meditative sleep. Brahma then prayed to Mahadevi and she helped awaken Vishnu. The two demons then fought against Vishnu and defeated him. Upon advice from Mahadevi, Vishnu employs a trick to destroy the two demons. Vishnu praises the battle powers of the two demons and says that he is pleased to grant them boons. The boastful demons, proud of their victories against Vishnu, say that they are willing to grant him boons instead. Vishnu cleverly asks Madhu and Kaitabha for their lives and they are forced to kill each other.

Griffin about the Philadelphia Police Department. Although the books were originally set in the 1970s and early 1980s, and the characters have only aged a few years (Matt Payne is still only 27), Book VIII, Final Justice, moves the story to the post-9/11 era. *The books are: **Book I, Men in Blue (MB) **Book II, Special Operations (SO) **Book III, The Victim (V) **Book IV, The Witness (W) **Book V, The Assassin (A) **Book VI, The Murderers (M) **Book VII, The Investigators (I) **Book VIII, Final Justice (FJ) **Book IX, The Traffickers **Book X, The Vigilantes **Book XI, The Last Witness **Book XII, Deadly Assets **Book XIII, Broken Trust Recurring characters =Jerry Carlucci= Jerry Carlucci is the former Police Commissioner and Mayor of Philadelphia. He is clearly modeled on Frank Rizzo. Like Rizzo, Carlucci served 26 years as a police officer and held \\"every rank but policewoman.\\" Despite being mayor and having a police commissioner under him, Carlucci insists on hands-on direction of the Police Department. In Final Justice, Carlucci is succeeded by African American Alvin Martin, who seems to be based on John F. Street. In an apparent disconnect, in The Traffickers, which begins approximately 30 days after the end of Final Justice, Mayor Carlucci is in full control. =Paulo Cassandro= Paulo Cassandro is the underboss of the Philadelphia Mafia. He is the owner of Classic Livery, which provides limousines to the public; he also serves as enforcer to Vincente Savarese, along with his brother, Pietro. =Taddeus Czernich= Taddeus Czernich is the nominal Commissioner of Police; in reality, he is nothing more than a figurehead for Jerry Carlucci. In Final Justice, Czernich is succeeded by Ralph Mariani, an Italian American. The Czernich character was based upon Joseph F. O'Neill, who was Mayor Rizzo's hand-picked Police Commissioner. O'Neill was referred to as \\"Big Red\\" or \\"The Irishman\\". =Penny Detweiler= Penelope Detweiler was the only daughter of Richard Detweiler, the majority stockholder in Nesfoods. She was involved with Anthony DeZego, \\"Tony the Zee,\\" and was present when DeZego was murdered. Her relationship with DeZego led to her addiction to heroin. She was hospitalized in a private sanitarium in Nevada. When she returned to Philadelphia, Detweiler had a brief relationship with Matt Payne. She died of a heroin overdose in The Murderers. =Matt Lowenstein= Chief Inspector Matthew Lowenstein is Chief of Detectives. He has resented Carlucci's interference with his force, and attempted to resign in The Murderers. He retained the office when Carlucci granted him concessions. This character is based on former Philadelphia Police Inspector Frank Goldberg. =Jesus Martinez= Jesus Martinez is a detective with the Special Operations Division of the Philadelphia Police. He started off partnered with Charlie McFadden as Narcotics undercover detectives. The two of them were highly effective, but their career ended when they caught the murderer of Highway Patrol chief \\"Dutch\\" Moffitt. The publicity ended their Narcotics careers, and Martinez went undercover as an officer at the Airport Unit to catch a crooked corporal. After that stint, Martinez was assigned to Special Operations. Martinez and McFadden are best friends as well as partners. However, Martinez does not like Matt Payne, whom he regards as a spoiled rich kid. =Charlie McFadden= Charlie McFadden, as noted above, was Jesus Martinez's partner in Narcotics. He was transferred to Special Operations while Martinez went to the Airport Unit, and continues to work in Special Operations as a detective. =Mickey O'Hara= Michael J. \\"Mickey\\" O'Hara is a former police reporter for the Philadelphia Bulletin. He is regarded as one of the best police reporters on the East Coast, and he is held in high regard by the police for several reasons, including listening to their side of controversial events. O'Hara drives a car equipped with several police band receivers (at the time the series was written, computer-controlled scanners were not available). In this, he resembles Larry Krebs, the former police reporter for WMAL in Washington, D.C. Although O'Hara is held in high esteem by the police, he has published stories that the police wanted played down, such as the arrest of a crooked police captain. He has also been on the site and taken photos when significant events took place, such as when Matt Payne shot and killed the Northwest Serial Rapist (in Special Operations). In The Vigilantes, O'Hara had left the Bulletin and had signed on to run a local crime information website known as 'CrimeFreePhilly.com'. =Matthew Payne= Matthew Payne, also known by the nicknames \\"Matt\\" or \\"Matty,\\" is the central figure of the Badge of Honor series. He is the son of Officer John X. Moffit, who was killed in the line of duty. His mother, Patricia Moffitt, took a job as a legal secretary to make a living, and met Brewster C. Payne, a prominent Philadelphia attorney and widower. They fell in love and remarried. Brewster Payne legally adopted Matt. Matt went to private school, where he was an average student with some clashes with the police and then to the University of Pennsylvania, where he attended Marine Corps ROTC. A minor medical condition prevented Matt from obtaining a commission in the Corps. About the same time, Matt's uncle, \\"Dutch\\" Moffitt, was killed. Matt decided to join the Philadelphia Police Department. Immediately after graduating from the Philadelphia Police Academy, Payne was assigned to Special Operations as Peter Wohl's assistant. This was done to keep him out of trouble; higher-ups in the department figured that Payne would come to his senses and leave the Department in time. Instead, Payne became a hero when he shot and killed a serial killer/rapist, who Payne found by accident, and who was attempting to run him over. His shooting saved a woman who had been inside the van. After receiving a high score on the Detective exam, Payne was then assigned to the East Division's detective office and worked routine operations such as retrieving stolen cars. He was reassigned to the Special Investigations section of Special Operations by order of Mayor Carlucci. In The Witness, Payne ended up shooting and being shot by one of a gang of armed robbers. Again, not intentionally: Wohl had sent him to escort Mickey O'Hara and to keep O'Hara safe and out of the line of any fire). Payne's stay in Special Operations was troublesome at times. Wohl reprimanded him for climbing on the 12th floor ledge of the Bellvue-Stratford Hotel to replace a surveillance microphone that had been knocked loose. He has also at times been referred to, sarcastically, as \\"Sherlock Holmes, Jr.\\" Wohl suspended Payne when he was assigned to Harrisburg and ended up romantically involved with a woman who was providing cover for terrorists/bank robbers; again, he was overruled by Carlucci. In Final Justice, Payne has become a Detective Sergeant. He solves a murder/rape case in Northwest Philadelphia (but not before breaking the heart of the female detective who becomes his main partner and assistant). He also chaperones a Philadelphia-born movie actor during the latter's return to the city and escorts home an escaped murderer from France. At the end of the book he suffers burnout and thinks of quitting. Payne is not married. He was in love with Penny Detweiler, but she died of a heroin overdose. Matts character is based on Kenneth Krieger, the Wayatt Earp of the Main line. Krieger was top shot in his academy class and was an A class shooter in IDPA and IPSC match's. Krieger went to work in Philadelphia and began a long career in undercover work (RATSNAKE), Across the country. Like Matt Payne, Krieger has been in 7 shootings and has matching holes like the main chatacter. =Amy Payne= Amy Payne is Matt Payne's older sister. She has a double doctorate, in pure mathematics and in medicine, and works as a psychiatrist. Among her patients have been Penelope Detweiler and (reluctantly) the granddaughter of Vincenzo Savarese. She has also assisted the Special Operations Division in profiling the Northwest Serial Rapist and an insane but intelligent man trying to kill the Vice-President. Amy Payne is prone to being distracted as a driver, makes snap psychological judgments of her brother, and annoyed when she runs into the bureaucracy of the Philadelphia Police Department. She is romantically involved with Peter Wohl. =Martha Peebles= Martha Peebles, in her late thirties, was the heir to a fortune based on anthracite coal mining. Her father disinherited her brother, Stephen, for being a homosexual. Stephen stayed with Martha, however, was forced to move out after several cases of pilferage. Martha asked for police assistance to protect her home. Captain Dave Pekach was sent to respond for public relations reasons. The two fell in love and Pekach moved in with Martha and later married. Martha doted on Pekach, and one of his biggest problems is preventing her from buying things for her \\"Precious.\\" =Dave Pekach= Captain Dave Pekach commands the Highway Unit of the Philadelphia Police Department. A former Narcotics Lieutenant, he was given command of Highway Patrol because Mayor Jerry Carlucci thinks that the former number two man in Highway, Captain Mike Sabara, \\"Looks like a concentration camp guard in uniform.\\" Investigating a series of burglaries at the Peebles home, he won the affections of Martha Peebles. =Vincenzo Savarese= Vincenzo Savarese is the head of Philadelphia's Mafia family. Although he has refined manners and is an accomplished violinist, Savarese is capable of ordering, albeit indirectly, a person's death. Savarese has a daughter who is married to a builder and is not involved in crime, and a granddaughter on whom he dotes. When she was raped by a rogue Narcotics cop, Savarese prevailed on Brewster Payne to have his daughter, Dr. Amy Payne, take care of her. He also arranged for the man who sold her drugs to be kidnapped and left to starve to death in the dark. =Jason Washington= Lieutenant Jason Washington is regarded by his peers, and himself, as Philadelphia's finest Homicide detective \\"between Key West, Florida and Bangor, Maine.\\" He is physically imposing, but sharply dressed; his nickname among other police is \\"The Black Buddha.\\" He speaks with a highly educated vocabulary. He is a master of using psychology with subjects under interrogation and in determining the anomalies in their stories. He would be regarded as vain if he was not able to back up his words with actions. Washington did not want to be transferred from Homicide to Special Operations because, as a Homicide detective, he earned considerable overtime pay. However, Inspector Wohl convinced him that he would be able to work as many hours as he wanted. In Final Justice, he is transferred back to Homicide as a Lieutenant. =Martha Washington= Ironically named similarly to the wife of America's first president, Martha is partner to Lieutenant Jason Washington. She is said to be a reputable art dealer and is forever dragging her husband to events in the art world. =Peter Wohl= Inspector Peter Wohl is the head of the Special Operations Division. In his career he served in the Highway Division as the youngest corporal in the unit; he was also the youngest sergeant, lieutenant, captain, and staff inspector in the Philadelphia Police Department. He has a reputation for honesty and for fighting corruption; before he was assigned to Special Operations, Wohl's investigation sent a corrupt Judge Moses Flinderman to prison. Wohl insists that his officers do things the smart and effective way and has chastised Matt Payne several times for doing courageous but \\"stupid\\" things, including suspending Payne one time (until Mayor Carlucci overrode him). Wohl is the son of Augustus Wohl, the retired Chief of Detectives. Augustus served as \\"rabbi\\" for several officers, including Carlucci. Peter is unmarried, though he has an on-again off-again romantic relationship with Amy Payne.

The Skydome is named after J. Lawrence Walkup (1914‚Äì2002), the president of NAU from 1957 to 1979, a period of tremendous growth for the university. During an era of tight budgets in the mid-1970s, he creatively coordinated financing for the venue.

The story is one of three stories by Rocklynne featuring the protagonist Jack Colbie of the Interplanetary Police and his pursuit of interplanetary criminal Edward Deverel (all three are in his collection The Men and the Mirror). Plot summary In the story, Colbie and Deverel inadvertently slip onto the nearly frictionless surface of an enormous concave mirror built by unknown alien beings, and must use the laws of physics to come up with a way to avoid oscillating in a pendulum motion back and forth across the mirror until eventually the small amount of friction brings them to a stop in the center. Although the physics of the story can be criticized, the story is a textbook example of the kind of science-fiction called a \\"science puzzle\\" story (a variety of gedanken or 'idea' subgenre tale), in which the set up of the story is a puzzle which must be solved using (real) science. Many later examples could be cited, including Hal Clement's story \\"Dust Rag\\" ,and Larry Niven's \\"Neutron Star\\". Adaptations Geoffrey A.

He claims to have taken part in the operation that masterminded the abduction and liquidation of Mehdi Ben Barka, and is as such one of the last surviving possible witnesses in the Benbarka Affair. Ben Barka Affair Although he was not present at the crime scene, he had to process all the information on the operation. He claims that CIA agents were involved, a certain Colonel Martin. Boukhari claimed in his confessions that Ben Barka's body was transported secretly to Morocco and his corpse was dissolved in a bath of acid. However, pro-government newspapers in Morocco claimed that Boukhari is a fraud and a liar. The movie \\"J'ai vu tuer Ben Barka\\" has been based partly on this book. Publications Boukhari authored two books, one about the Ben Barka affair, title Le Secret and the other Raisons d'√©tat (published in 2005), where he recounts the operations of the DST from the 1960s to the 1980s during the repression of various dissident movements, mainly from the socialist left. He remains the only insider who has ever published about the DST. =Arrest, trial and harassment by authorities= Because of his revelations, Boukhari had many problems with the justice in Morocco. Including defamation lawsuits by former employees of the DST and the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, whom he mentioned by name in his book, as well as other common affairs such as dishonoured cheques, which were claimed to be used against him in order to sentence him in a non-political affair.

Its parent was awarded Qualifying Full Bank (QFB) status on 20 October 1999, and this status was transferred to the Singapore division on the day of its incorporation. The bank has a shared automated teller machine (ATM) network with HSBC, State Bank of India, Maybank, The Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of China, and Standard Chartered Singapore called atm5. The bank's headquarters are located at Asia Square. The main branch is at Capital Square at 23 Church Street. With the QFB status, the bank was entitled to open up to 25 branches, with up to ten from 1 January 2005. Back-end operations are concentrated in Changi Business Park. History Citibank established operations in Singapore on 1 July 1902. It was then known as the International Banking Corporation (IBC) and was the first United States bank to set up a branch in Singapore. Located at 1 Prince Street, IBC was primarily involved in the trade financing of Malayan rubber and tin exports in the early 20th century. In the 1980s, Citibank was the first bank in Singapore to popularise the use of automated teller machines (ATMs). Citibank established its Global Consumer Banking division in 1982 to cater to the needs of individuals and small businesses. In the early 1990s, it created Singapore's first telephone banking service which was manned 24 hours by CitiPhone officers. Although a relative latecomer to the retail-banking sector, the bank has grown into a formidable market player with a major market share in key businesses including unsecured lending, deposits and investments and secured assets. Citibank was among the first four foreign banks to be awarded a Qualifying Full Bank (QFB) licence by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in 1999. In June 2002 Citibank was the first QFB-licensed bank in Singapore to offer the Visa global debit service, and the following July it was the first in Singapore to introduce a debit card cashback scheme through the Visa platform. Called Citibank Instant Cash, the scheme allows customers who hold an International Citicard with the Visa point-of-sale debit feature to withdraw funds from their Citibank accounts when making purchase payments at retail locations.

Background In 1314 Louis of Wittelsbach had been elected Rex Romanorum against Frederick of Habsburg at Frankfurt, however with the decisive fourth vote cast by the Elector John II of Saxe-Lauenburg. The election was denied not only by the rivaling duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg but also by the Archbishop of Cologne, who traditionally held the privilege to crown the elected king at Aachen. Moreover, Henry of Carinthia had acted as the Bohemian elector, voting for Frederick, although he had already been deposed as king by John of Luxembourg in 1310. Louis was crowned by Peter von Aspelt, the Archbishop of Mainz, while Frederick of Habsburg received consecration by the Cologne archbishop, though not at Aachen but in Bonn. The legal uncertainty of the double election resulted in a long-standing conflict, finally settled by the 1322 Battle of M√ºhldorf in favour of Louis. The controversy broadened as Pope John XXII in Avignon, willing to restore the papal claim to power, nevertheless dependent on the French royal House of Capet, refused to acknowledge Louis' election. Instead he took the occasion to install Robert of Naples from the Capetian House of Anjou as \\"Senator of Rome\\" and regent of the Imperial Kingdom of Italy in 1317. The king however was the choice of the Ghibelline party which included not only the House of Wittelsbach but also the Bohemian Luxembourgs and the Milanese Visconti. The pope accused Louis of having usurped the royal title without papal approbation as he was crowned by the \\"wrong\\" archbishop. The conflict escalated with the declaration of anathema and interdict by the pope against the king and all his supporters in 1324. King Louis, no longer contested in Germany, now was able to campaign Italy, where he obtained the Iron Crown of Lombardy in 1327, while the papal regent Robert of Naples was deposed. One year later he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor per acclamation by the \\"people of Rome\\" under the Ghibelline leader Sciarra Colonna without any participation of the pope. Thereafter he nominated Antipope Nicholas V to receive consecration from him. Nevertheless, the political situation in Italy changed again in favour of the House of Anjou, revealing that the Emperor could not actually maintain his sovereignty. Louis was forced to return to Germany, leaving the conflict with the papacy unsettled. Agreement In view of the denied recognition by the pope, the prince-electors saw the necessity to affirm their franchise. On 16 July 1338Hughes, Philip. _A Short history of the Catholic Church_. Burns & Oates Ltd, 1974. six electors from Cologne, Mainz and Trier, Saxe-Wittenberg, Brandenburg and the Electorate of the Palatinate met at the Nussbaumgarten in Rhens to support Emperor Louis IV. Even though the practice of election of the Holy Roman Emperor had finally prevailed since the fall of the House of Hohenstaufen, it was now fixed that the election by all or the majority of the electors automatically conferred the royal title and rule over the empire, without papal confirmation.Britannica Educational Publishing. Germany, ed. Michael Ray. Britannica Educational Publishing, 2013. p.153. The convened prince-electors decided that \\"Louis is the rightfully elected King of the Romans, and his legitimate power (in the German kingdom) is not dependent upon the pope's will\\". In coincidence with the Emperor's loss of power over Italy the decree meant a decisive step beyond the universal claim of the translatio imperii derived from the Roman Empire and conveyed by the pope. Louis reacted with two mandates of 6 August 1338, stating that the Emperor-elect is vested with complete Imperial rights and all estates are obliged to ignore dissenting papal decretals. In 1356 the Golden Bull issued by Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg specified the procedures for imperial election, the electoral college - including the Bohemian king - having already been those seven by custom. As result the monarch, no longer subject to papal approbation, became increasingly dependent on the favour of the electors. The declaration is not to be confused with another meeting of electors at Rhens on 20 August 1400 to depose King Wenceslaus of Luxembourg and elect Rupert of Wittelsbach.

He is the most popular Kuladaivat (family deity) in Maharashtra.Singh p.ix He is also the patron deity of select warrior, farming castes, Dhangar community and Brahmin (priestly) castes as well as several of the hunter/gatherer tribes that are native to the hills and forests of this region. The cult of Khandoba has linkages with Hindu and Jain traditions, and also assimilates all communities irrespective of caste, including Muslims. The worship of Khandoba developed during the 9th and 10th centuries from a folk deity into a composite god possessing the attributes of Shiva, Bhairava, Surya and Kartikeya (Skanda). He is depicted either in the form of a linga, or as an image of a warrior riding on a bull or a horse. The foremost centre of Khandoba worship is Jejuri in Maharashtra. The legends of Khandoba, found in the text Malhari Mahatmya and also narrated in folk songs, revolve around his victory over demons Mani-malla and his marriages. Etymology and other names The name \\"Khandoba\\" comes from the words \\"khadga\\" (sword), the weapon used by Khandoba to kill the demons, and \\"ba\\" (father). \\"Khanderaya\\" means \\"king Khandoba\\". Another variant is \\"Khanderao\\", where the suffix \\"rao\\" (king) is used. In Sanskrit texts, Khandoba is known as Martanda Bhairava or Surya, a combination of the solar deity Martanda and Shiva's fierce form Bhairava. The name \\"Mallari\\" or \\"Malhari\\" is split as \\"Malla\\" and \\"ari\\" (enemy), thus meaning \\"enemy of the demon Malla\\". Malhari Mahatmya records Martanda Bhairava, pleased with the bravery of Malla, takes the name \\"Mallari\\" (the enemy of Malla).Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.314 Other variants include Malanna (Mallanna) and Mailara (Mailar). Khandoba is sometimes identified with Muneeshwara of Dharmapuri Mallanna of Telangana, MallikarjunaSwamy of Andhrapradesh and Mailara of Karnataka. Other names include Khandu Gavda, Mhalsa-kant (\\"husband of Mhalsa\\") and Jejurica Vani.Sontheimer in Feldhaus p.115 Iconography Khandoba seated on a white horse In a popular oleograph representation of Khandoba,Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.284 Mhalsa is seated in front of Khandoba on his white horse. Mhalsa is piercing a demon's chest with a spear, while a dog is biting his thigh and the horse is hitting his head. The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's hooves or their heads under Khandoba's knees.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.288 In murtis (icons), Khandoba or Mailara is depicted as having four arms, carrying a damaru (drum), Trishula (trident), Bhandara-patra (turmeric powder- filled bowl) and khadga (sword). Khandoba's images are often dressed as a Maratha sardar,Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.303 or a Muslim pathan. Often, Khandoba is depicted as a warrior seated on horseback with one or both of his wives and accompanied with one or more dogs.Stanley (Nov. 1977) p. 32 He is also worshipped as the aniconic linga, the symbol of Shiva.For worship of Khandoba in the form of a lingam and possible identification with Shiva based on that, see: Mate, p. 176. Often in Khandoba temples, both representations of Khandoba ‚Äî the aniconic linga and the anthropomorphic horseback form. Legends Legends of Khandoba generally tell about the battle between the deity and demons Malla and Mani. The principle written source of the legend is Malhari Mahatmya (Mallari Mahatmya), which claims to be from the chapter Kshetra-kanda of the Sanskrit text Brahmanda Purana, but is not included in standard editions of the Purana.Sontheimer in Bakker p.103 R.C. Dhere and Sontheimer suggests that the Sanskrit Mahatmya was composed around 1460‚Äì1510 AD, mostly by a Deshastha Brahmin, to whom Khandoba is the family deity.Sontheimer in Bakker pp.105‚Äì6 A version is also available in Marathi by Siddhapal Kesasri (1585).Sontheimer in Bakker p.105 Other sources include the later texts of Jayadri Mahatmya and Martanda Vijaya by Gangadhara (1821)Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.330 and the oral stories of the Vaghyas, bards of the god.Stanley in Hiltebeitel pp. 272,293 Mani is seen worshipped in the Jejuri temple of Khandoba The legend tell of the demon Malla and his younger brother Mani, who had gained the boon of invincibility from Brahma, creating chaos on the earth and harassing the sages. When the seven sages approached Shiva for protection after Indra and Vishnu confessed their incapability, Shiva assumed the form (Avatar) of Martanda Bhairava, as the Mahatmya calls Khandoba, riding the Nandi bull, leading an army of the gods. Martanda Bhairava is described as shining like the gold and sun, covered in turmeric also known as Haridra,http://www.khandoba.org/about_khandoba.html three-eyed, with a crescent moon on his forehead.Sontheimer in Bakker p.118 The demon army was slaughtered by the gods and finally Khandoba killed Malla and Mani. While dying, Mani offers his white horse to Khandoba as an act of repentance and asks for a boon. The boon is that he be present in every shrine of Khandoba, that human-kind is bettered and that he be given an offering of goat flesh. The boon was granted, and thus he was transformed into a demigod. Malla, when asked by the deity if he asked for a boon, asks for the destruction of the world and human-flesh. Angered by the demon's request, Khandoba decapitates him, and his head falls at the temple stairs where it was trampled by the devotees feet. The legend further describes how two Lingas appeared at Prempuri, the place where the demons were killed.Stanley in Hiltebeitel pp.272‚Äì77For a detailed synopsis of Malhari Mahtmya, see Sontheimer in Bakker pp.116‚Äì26 Oral stories continue the process of Sanskritization of Khandoba ‚Äî his elevation from a folk deity to Shiva, a deity of the classical Hindu pantheon ‚Äî that was initiated by the texts. Khandoba's wives Mhalsa and Banai are also identified with Shiva's classical Hindu wives Parvati and Ganga. Hegadi Pradhan, the minister and brother-in-law of Khandoba and brother of Lingavat Vani Mhalsa,Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.328 the faithful dog that helps Khandoba kill the demons, the horse given by Mani and the demon brothers are considered avatars of Vishnu, Krishna, Nandi and the demons Madhu-Kaitabha respectively. Other myth variants narrate that Khandoba defeats a single demon named Manimalla, who offers his white horse, sometimes called Mani, to the god.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.278 Other legends depict Mhalsa (or Parvati) and Banai or Banu (or Ganga) as futilely helping Khandoba in the battle to collect the blood of Mani, every drop of which was creating a new demon. Finally, the dog of Khandoba swallows all the blood. Sometimes, Mhalsa, or rarely Banai, is described as seated behind Khandoba on the horse and fighting with a sword or spear.Stanley in Hiltebeitel pp.280‚Äì4 The legends portray Khandoba as a king who rules from his fortress of Jejuri and holds court where he distributes gold. Also, king Khandoba goes on hunting expeditions, which often turn into \\"erotic adventures\\", and subsequent marriages.Sontheimer in Feldhaus p.116 Wives Khandoba with his two chief wives: Mhalsa and Banai. Khandoba has two wives who are women from different communities, who serve as cultural links between the god and the communities. He has two wives, Mhalsa and Banai (Banu, Banubai) being the most important. While Khandoba's first wife Mhalsa is from the Lingayat merchant (Vani) community, his second wife Banai is a Dhangar (shepherd caste). Mhalsa has had a regular ritualistic marriage with Khandoba. Banai, on the other hand, has a love marriage by capture with the god. Mhalsa is described as jealous and a good cook; Banai is erotic, resolute, but does not even know to cook. Often folk songs tell of their quarrels. Mhalsa represents \\"culture\\" and Banai \\"nature\\". The god king Khandoba stands between them.Sontheimer in Feldhaus p.117-8 Mhalsa is believed to be a combined avatara of Mohini and Parvati. Mhalsa was born as the daughter of a rich merchant in Newase called Tirmarsheth. On the divine orders of Khandoba in a dream to Tirmarsheth, she was married to Khandoba on Pausha Pournima (the full moon day of Hindu calendar month of Paush) in Pali(Pembar). Two shivlingas appeared on this occasion. An annual festival marking this event is celebrated in Pali every Paush Pournima. Banai is believed to the daughter of Indra, the king of the gods or as Incarnation of Goddess Ganga. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she fell in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive again if he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri. On reaching Jejuri, Khandoba was greeted by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave the upper half of the hill to Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway down the hill. Khandoba's third wife, Rambhai Shimpin, is a tailor woman who was a heavenly nymph or devangana and is sometimes identified with Banai. She is a prototype of the Muralis ‚Äî the girls \\"married\\" to Khandoba. Rambhai is worshipped as a goddess whom Khandoba visits after his hunt. She is also localised, being said to come from the village from Belsare, near Jejuri. The fourth wife Phulai Malin, from the gardener or Mali caste, She was a particular Murali and is thus a deified devotee of Khandoba. She is visited by him at \\"Davna Mal\\" (field of southernwood, a herb said to be dear to Khandoba). The fifth wife, Candai Bhagavin, is a Telin, a member of the oilpresser caste. She is recognised as a Muslim by the Muslims. Apart from these, Muralis ‚Äî girls offered to Khandoba ‚Äî are considered as wives or concubines of the god.Sontheimer in Feldhaus p. 118Stanley (Nov. 1977) p. 33 Other associations and identifications A painting depicts Khandoba riding a white horse with Mhalsa, accompanied with a dog and attendants including a Waghya dancing before him. Mallana (Mallikaarjuna) of Andhra Pradesh and Mailara of Karnataka are sometimes identified with Khandoba (Mallari, Malhari, Mairaj). Khandoba is also associated with Bhairava, who is connected with BrƒÅhmanahatya (murder of a Brahmin).Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p. 300 Devotees emphasize that Khandoba is a full avatar of Shiva, and not a partial avatar like Bhairava or Virabhadra. He accepts the attributes of the demon king ‚Äî his horse, weapons and royal insignia.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.332 Sontheimer stresses the association of Khandoba with clay and termite mounds. Oral legends tell of Khandoba's murtis being found in termite mounds or \\"made of earth\\".Sontheimer in Bakker p.110 According to Sontheimer, Martanda Bhairava (Khandoba) is a combination of the sun god Surya and Shiva, who is associated with the moon. Martanda (\\"blazing orb\\") is a name of Surya, while Bhairava is a form of Shiva. Sundays, gold and turmeric, which are culturally associated with the sun, form an important part of the rituals of Khandoba. Sontheimer associates the worship of the Sun as termite mounds for fertility and his role as a healer to Khandoba's role as granter of fertility in marriages and to the healing powers of turmeric, which the latter holds.Sontheimer in Bakker p.113 Another theory identifies Kartikeya (Skanda) with Khandoba.For use of the name Khandoba as a name for Karttikeya in Maharashtra, Gupta Preface, and p. 40. The hypotheses of the theory rests upon the similarities between Skanda and Khandoba, namely their association with mountains and war, similarity of their names and weapons (the lance of Skanda and the sword of Khandoba) and both having two principal wives. Also the festivals for both deities, Champa Sashthi and Skanda Sashthi respectively for Khandoba and Skanda fall on the same day. Other symbols associated with Khandoba are the dog and horse.Sontheimer in Bakker p.114 Worship Khandoba in a household shrine (devghar) of a Deshastha Brahmin family Though Shiva is worshipped across Maharashtra in his original form, some Maharashtrian communities prefer to worship him in form of his avatars, Khandoba being the most popular.Stanley (Nov. 1977) p. 31 He is the most popular Kuldevta (family deity) in Maharashtra. One of the most widely worshipped gods of the Deccan plateau, Khandoba is considered as \\"the premier god of Sakama bhakti (wish-granting devotion) and one of the most powerful deities responsive to vows (navas)\\". He is worshipped by the vast majority of Marathi Hindu people from all strata of that society. He is the patron deity of warrior, farming, herding as well as some Brahmin (priest) castes, the hunters and gatherers of the hills and forests, merchants and kings. The cult of Khandoba in the Deccan principally consists of peasant classes Marathas and Kunabis, shepherd Dhangars, village guards and watchmen Ramoshis ‚Äî a \\"Denotified tribe\\", the former \\"untouchable\\" Mahars and Mangs, fisher-folk Kolis, balutedar castes like gardeners (Mali) and tailors (Shimpi), though it also includes of a few Brahmins and even some Muslims.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.271 Although Brahmin presence is nominal in his cult, Deshastha Brahmins, as well as the Kokanastha Brahmins - in Nashik and Satara - do worship Khandoba, some imitating the Deshastha Brahmins. The Deshastha Brahmins, Chandraseniya Kayastha Prabhus, as well as the royal families like Gaikwads and Holkars worship Khandoba as their Kuldevta. He is also worshipped by Jains and Lingayats. He is viewed as a \\"king\\" of his followers.Sontheimer in Bakker p.104 =Rituals and modes of worship= The sanctum of Khandoba's older temple Kadepathar, Jejuri. Khandoba is worshipped in three forms: stone icon with the consorts (top), metal icon with Mhalsa (mid, covered with garlands) and two lingas, symbolizing him and Mhalsa. Khandoba is believed to be a kadak (fierce) deity, who causes troubles if not propitiated properly as per the family duties.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel pp.332‚Äì3 Khandoba is worshipped with Turmeric (BhandƒÅr), Bel fruit-leaves, onions and other vegetables.Underhill p.111 The deity is offered puran poli ‚Äì a sweet or a simpler dish called bharit rodga of onion and brinjal.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.296 Mostly a vegetarian naivedya (offering of food) is offered to Khandoba in the temples, although he is regarded by his devotees as a non- vegetarian. Goat flesh is also offered to the deity, although this is done outside the temple as meat is forbidden inside the temple. An important part of the Khandoba-cult is navas, a vow to perform service to the god in return for a boon of good harvest, male child, financial success etc. On fulfilment of the navas, Khandoba was offered children or some devotees would afflict pain by hook-swinging or fire-walking.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.293 This type of worship using navas is called Sakama Bhakti ‚Äì worship done with an expectation of return and is considered \\"to be of a lower esteem\\".Burman p.1227 But the most faithful bhaktas (devotees) are considered to be greedy only for the company of their Lord, Khandoba is also called bhukela ‚Äì hungry for such true bhaktas in Martanda Vijaya.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.313 A Vaghya, the bard of Khandoba Boys called VƒÅghyƒÅ (or Waghya, literally \\"tigers\\") and girls called Mura·∏πi were formerly dedicated to Khandoba, but now the practice of marrying girls to Khandoba is illegal. The Vaghyas act as the bards of Khandoba and identify themselves with the dogs of Khandoba, while Muralis act as his courtesans (devanganas ‚Äî nymphs or devadasis). The Vaghyas and their female counterparts Muralis sing and dance in honour of Khandoba and narrate his stories on jagarans ‚Äî all night song-festivals, which are sometimes held after navas fulfilment. Another custom was ritual-suicide by Viras (heroes) in the cult.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.308 According to legend, an \\"untouchable\\" Mang (Matanga) sacrificed himself for the foundation of the temple at Jejuri to persuade Khandoba to stay at Jejuri forever. Other practices in the cult include the belief that Khandoba possesses the body of a Vaghya or devrsi (shaman).Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel p.302See Stanley in Zelliot pp. 40‚Äì53: for details of possession beliefs: Angat Yene:Possession by the Divine Another ritual in the cult is an act of chain-breaking in fulfilment of a vow or an annual family rite; the chain is identified with the snake around Shiva's neck, which was cut by the demons in the fight. Another rite associated with the family duties to please Khandoba is the tali bharne, which is to be performed every full moon day. A tali (dish) is filled with coconuts, fruits, betel nuts, saffron, turmeric (Bhandar) and Bel leaves. Then, a coconut is placed on a pot filled with water and the pot is worshipped as an embodiment of Khandoba. Then, five persons lift the tali, place it repeatedly on the pot thrice, saying \\"Elkot\\" or \\"Khande rayaca Elkot\\". Then the coconut in the tali is broken and mixed with sugar or jaggery and given to friends and relatives. A gondhal is performed along with the tali bharne. A gondhal is a ritualistic folk art in which the performer Gondhalis invoke the deities. Khandoba is considered as the giver of fertility. Maharashtrian Hindu couples are expected to visit a Khandoba temple to obtain Khandoba's blessing on consummation of marriage. Traditional Maharashtrian families also organize a jagaran as part of the marriage ceremony, inviting the god to the marriage. Copper figurines of Khandoba riding on a horse (sometimes with Mhalsa) are worshipped by devotees on a daily basis in the household shrine. The Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya suggests offerings of incense, lights, betel and animals to Khandoba. The Marathi version mentions offerings of meat and the worship by chedapatadi ‚Äì \\"causing themselves to be cut\\", hook-swinging and self- mortification by viras. Marathi version calls this form of bhakti (devotion) as ugra (violent, demonic) bhakti. Martanda vijaya narrates about Rakshashi bhakti (demonic worship) by animal sacrifice and self ‚Äî torture. Possession by Khandoba, in form of a wind, is lower demonic worship (pishachi worship). Sattvic worship, the purest form of worship, is believed to be feeding Khandoba in form of a Brahmin. =Muslim veneration= Khandoba is also a figure of respect and worship to Muslims, and this affiliation is visible in the style of his temples. He is called Mallu or Ajmat Khan (Rautray) by Muslim devotees, and many times portrayed as being a Muslim himself in this context. The latter is believed to conferred upon by the Mughal invader king Aurangzeb, who was forced to flee from Jejuri by Khandoba's power. Some of these distinguishing Muslim features include his usual appearance as that of a Pa·π≠hƒÅn on horseback, one of his wives being a Muslim, and that his horse- keeper is a Muslim in Jejuri. The MƒÅrta·πá·∏ça Vijaya expressly states that his devotees are mainly Muslims. The worship of Khandoba had received royal patronage by Ibrahim II, which consisted of the reinstatement of the annual jatra and the right of pilgrims to perform rituals at the Naldurg temple.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel pp. 325‚Äì7 Malhari Mahatmya even records Muslims (mleccha) as the god's bhaktas (devotees), who call him as Malluka Pathan or Mallu Khan.Sontheimer in Bakker p.116 In Jejuri, a Muslim family traditionally looks after the horses of the god. =Temples= Khandoba's newer Temple in Jejuri. Notice devotees showering turmeric powder (bhandara) on each other, in a temple festival. Mylara Lingeshwara Temple at Mylara, Bellary District, Karnataka There are over 600 temples dedicated to Khandoba in the Deccan. His temples stretch from Nasik, Maharashtra in the north to Davangere, Karnataka in the south, Konkan, Maharashtra in the west to western Andhra Pradesh in the east. The eleven principal centres of worship of Khandoba or jagrut kshetras, where the deity is to be called awake or \\"jagrut\\", are recognized; six of them in Maharashtra and the rest in northern Karnataka. Khandoba's temples resemble forts, the capital of his kingdom being Jejuri. The priests here are Guravs, not Brahmins. His most important temples are: # Jejuri: The foremost center of worship of Khandoba.For Jejuri as the foremost center of worship see: Mate, p. 162. It is situated 48 km from Pune, Maharashtra. There are two temples: the first is an ancient temple known as Kadepathar. Kadepathar is difficult to climb. The second one is the newer and more famous Gad-kot temple, which is easy to climb. This temple has about 450 steps, 18 Kamani (arches) and 350 Dipmalas (lamp-pillars). Both temples are fort-like structures. # Pali (Rajapur) or Pali-Pember, Satara district, Maharashtra. # Adi-mailar or Khanapur (Pember or Mailkarpur) near Bidar, Karnataka # Naldurg, Osmanabad district, Maharashtra. # Mailara Linga, Dharwad district, Karnataka. # Mangasuli, Belgaum district, Karnataka. # Maltesh or Mailara temple at Devaragudda, Ranebennur Taluk, Haveri district, Karnataka. # Mannamailar or Mailar (Mylara), Bellary, Karnataka. # Nimgaon Dawadi, Pune district, Maharashtra.Nimgaon # Shegud, Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra. # Komuravelli, Siddipet district, Telangana. # Satare, Aurangabad district, Maharashtra. # Mailaralingeshwar temple at Mailapur, Yadgir district, Karnataka. # Jai Malhar temple at Mangaon,Shahapur, Thane district,Maharashtra. # Khandoba temple near Kalgaon, Tq. & Dist.

Khandoba is depicted with the traditional attributes of Shiva like the Trishula, damaru and the deer. A six-day festival, from the first to sixth lunar day of the bright fortnight of the Hindu month of Margashirsha, in honour of Khandoba is celebrated at Jejuri, to commemorate the fight with demons Mani-Malla. On the sixth day (Champa-Shashthi), Khandoba is believed to have slew the demons. A jatra (temple festival and fair) is held in Pember on Champa-shasthi, and the festival continues until the day of the new moon.Sontheimer in Bakker p.108 Another festival Somvati Amavasya, which is a new-moon day that falls on a Monday, is celebrated in Jejuri. A palakhi (palanquin) procession of Khandoba and Mhalsa's images is carried from the Gad-kot temple to the Karha river, where the images are ritually bathed.Sontheimer in Bakker p.127See Stanley (Nov. 1977) pp. 34‚Äì38 for a detailed description Deshasth Brahmans and Marathas also observe the annual Champa-Shashthi festival. The images of Khandoba and Malla are cleaned and worshipped. For six days, a fast is observed. On the seventh day, the devotees break their fast by a feast known as Champasashtliiche parne. An invitation to this feast is regarded as an invitation from Khandoba himself and is harder to refuse.[A HISTORY OF THE MARATHA PEOPLE, C A. KINCAID, CV.O., I.CS. AND Rao Bahadur D. B. PARASNIS, VOL II, page 314, HUMPHREY MILFORD, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS LONDON BOMBAY CALCUTTA MADRAS, 1922] In Pali-Pember, the ritual of the marriage of Khandoba with Mhalsa is annually performed. Turmeric is offered to the deities. Two festivals are celebrated in honour of Mailara, as Khandoba is known in Karnataka. These are the Dasara festival at Devaragudda, and an eleven-day festival in Magha month (February‚ÄìMarch) in Mailar, Bellary district. Both festivals have enactments of the battle between Mailar and the demons Mani-Malla.Stanley in Hiltebeitel p.314 Chaitra Purnima (full-moon day) is also considered auspicious.See Stanley (Nov. 1977) p. 39 In general, Sundays, associated with the sun-god, are considered as considered auspicious for Khandoba worship.Stanley (Nov. 1977) p. 30 Development of the cult Khandoba with his wives at Mailar Mallanna temple, Khanapur near Bidar, Karnataka. The cult of Khandoba, a folk religion, reflects the effect of Vedic Rudra, the Puranic Shiva worshipped as Linga in Brahmanical religion and Nath and Lingayat sects. Khandoba may be a product of the Vedic Rudra, who like Khandoba was associated with robbers, horses and dogs.Sontheimer in Hiltebeitel pp.301‚Äì2 Sayana traces the name Malhari to Taittiriya Samhita, Malhari is explained as enemy (ari) of Malha (Prajapati) ‚Äì an epithet of Rudra, who is considered a rival to deity Prajapati. According to Stanley, Khandoba originated as a mountain-top god, solar deity and a regional guardian and then assimilated into himself gods of various regions and communities. According to Stanley, Khandoba inherits traits from both the sun-god Surya as well as Shiva, who is identified with the moon. Stanley describes Khandoba as \\"a moon god, who has become a sun god\\", emphasizing on how the moon imagery of Shiva transforms into the solar iconography of Khandoba in the Malhari Mahatmya. As per R. C. Dhere, two stone inscriptions in 1063 C.E. and 1148 C.E mentioning the folk deities Mailara and his consort Malavva which suggests that Mailara gained popularity in Karnataka in this period. Soon, royals of this region started erecting temples to this folk deity, upsetting the elite class of established religion who vilified Mailara. Initially exaulted by an incarnation of Shiva, Mailara was denounced by Basava, the founder of the Shiva-worshipping Lingayat sect ‚Äì who would later promote the deity. Chakradhar Swami (c.1270, founder of Mahanubhava sect), Vidyaranyaswami, Sheikh Muhammad also criticized the god. The Varkari poet-saint Eknath also wrote \\"disparagingly\\" about Khandoba's cult worship, but after him, the \\"open\\" criticism of Khandoba stopped, but the \\"barbaric\\" practices of his cult were still targeted. Sontheimer suggests that Khandoba was primarily a god of herdsmen, and that the cult of Khandoba is at least older than 12th century, which can be determined by references in Jain and Lingayat texts and inscriptions. A 12th-century Jain author Brahmashiva claims that a Jain, who died in battle after a display of his valour, was later named as Mailara. By the 13th century, wide worship of Malhari or Mailara is observed by kings, Brahmins, simple folk and warriors. With the rise of Muslim empire, classical Hindu temples fell into ruin, giving rise to the folk religion such as of Khandoba. Chakradhar Swami remarks, 'by the end of the Kali Yuga, temples of Vishnu and Shiva will be destroyed, but those of Mailara will stay'. A 1369 AD inscription at Inavolu near Warangal tells an account of Mallari different from Malhari Mahatmya ‚Äî Shiva helped the epic hero Arjuna kill the demon Malla, thus acquiring the title of Mallari. Mailara was the family deity of Kakatiya dynasty (1083‚Äì1323 AD); a text from their rule records the self- torture rituals of Mailara-devotees and describes the deity. Throughout his development, Mailara is looked upon as a lower manifestation of Ishvara (God) by Lingayat and Maharashtrian bhakti saints.Sontheimer in Bakker pp. 106‚Äì7 By the 18th century, Khandoba had become the clan deity of the Maratha Empire. In 1752, the Maratha dowager queen Tarabai chose Khandoba's Jejuri temple to seal his pact with the Peshwa ruler, Balaji Bajirao, in the deity's presence. Malhari Mahatmya states that Khandoba first appeared on Champashasti, which was a Sunday, at Premapur, which identified as Pember (Adimailar, Mailarapur) near Bidar. Marathi traditions tell that Khandoba came originally from Premapuri, now Pember in Karnataka, then went to Naldurg, Pali and finally to Jejuri. Sontheimer suggests that the cult of Mailara may have originated in Pember and then spread to Maharashtra, merging with the cult of Khandaka ‚Äî the patron yaksha (demi-god) of Paithan giving it its distinct Maharashtrain characteristics. Maharashtrains call the god ‚Äì Kanadya Khanderaya, the god from Karnataka. The cult possibly was spread by Lingayat, Jain and other merchants, associated with Mailara-Khandoba, to other parts of the Deccan. Besides Mailara, Khandoba is identified with other deities of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, and is called as Mallanna, Mairala, and Mallu Khan.Sontheimer in Bakker pp.108‚Äì9 Other traditions like Shakta cults of folk goddesses were assimilated into the Khandoba cult, identifying the goddesses with Khandoba's wives Mhalsa or Banai. Marathi literature has a mixed reaction to the cult of Khandoba. Naranjanamadhva (1790) in stotra (hymn) dedicated to Khandoba calls him \\"an illustrious king with rich clothes and a horse with a saddle studded with jewels\\", who was once \\"an ascetic beggar who ride an old bull and carried an ant-bitten club (khatvanga)\\" ‚Äì a humorous take on the Puranic Shiva. In another instance (1855), he is called a ghost by a Christian missionary and Konastha Brahmin in a debate against Deshastha Brahmin. Another Brahmin remarks with scorn about the impurity of the Khandoba temple, visited by Shudras and whose priests are non-Brahmin Guravs. The Marathi term \\"khel- khandoba\\", which is taken to mean \\"devastation\\" in general usage, refers to the possession of devotee by the god in his cult.

Suhr has been a big advocate in helping push professional pole vaulting back into the American Track and Field circuit. Suhr‚Äôs success over the last 8-year period took the National pole vault scene by surprise. This drew incredible interest and criticism. Suhr's competitors identify him to be at the highest expert level in what he does (pole vault technique). Suhr was quoted responding to criticism, \\"Success breeds incredible jealousy, first people say you are lucky, then they criticize your technique, then when they can no longer do that, they attack you personally and simply say ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt like his coaching style or philosophy‚Äù.

American Revolutionary War Some sources give his date of birth as 1764.Bowles, William Augustus, General Bowles was born in Frederick County, Maryland, and joined the Maryland Loyalist Battalion at the age of thirteen with the junior officer rank of Ensign, travelling with the battalion when it was ordered to form part of the garrison of Pensacola. Upon arrival, Bowles resigned his commission, and left the fortifications. He was captured by Indians from the Creek Nation. While he was living with the Creek Tribe, Spanish naval forces with soldiers embarked upon their ships, and began to attack British forts along the Gulf Coast. Bowles convinced the Creeks to support the British garrison of Pensacola against the Spaniards, but the garrison fell when the powder magazine at the fortress was hit by artillery fire from the Spanish ships. The survivors of the garrison were captured, but Bowles escaped into the wilderness with his Creek allies. This occurred May 9, 1781, when Bowles was either 16 or 17 years old. After this battle, he was reinstated in the British Army and went to the Bahamas. After a few months in the Bahamas, the British governor Lord Dunmore sent Bowles back among the Creeks with a charge to establish a trading house among them. Bowles established a trading post along the Chattahoochee River. He would marry two wives, one Cherokee and the other a daughter of the Hitchiti Muscogee chieftain, William Perryman, and used this union as the basis for his claim to exert political influence among the Creeks, later styling himself \\"Director General of the Muskogee Nation\\". Mixed marriages were common among the Seminoles and Creeks according to historian James Leitch Wright, but historian Kevin Mulroy disagrees strongly with Wright's contention.. After the war Pursuing his idea of an American Indian state after the end of the Revolutionary War, he was received by George III as \\"Chief of the Embassy for Creek and Cherokee Nations\\" and it was with British backing that he returned to Florida. In 1795, along with the Seminoles, he formed a short-lived state in northern Florida (part of Spanish East Florida) known as the State of Muskogee, with himself as its \\"Director General.\\" After designing a flag and constitution for his state, Bowles raised an army and began to carry out raids of Spanish territories in Florida. In 1800, he declared war on Spain. Bowles operated two schooners and boasted of a force of 400 frontiersmen, former slaves, and warriors. A furious Spain offered $6,000 and 1,500 kegs of rum for his capture. When he was finally captured, he was transported to Madrid where he was unmoved by King Charles IV's attempts to make him change sides. He then escaped, commandeering a ship and returning to the Gulf of Mexico. One of the main victims of his piracy was the trading firm of Panton, Leslie & Company. In 1803, not long after having declared himself \\"Chief of all Indians present\\" at a tribal council, he was betrayed and turned over to the Spanish.

He was born in Ghazni Province. Career Educated in the Soviet Union, he served as an air force pilot under the monarchy of Mohammed Zahir Shah, and later as the air force garrison commander under President Mohammed Daoud Khan in 1973. When the Communist government took over he was appointed head of the Afghan Security Service (AGSA) in 1978 and continued to serve until he was replaced by Hafizullah Amin's nephew, Asadullah Amin in October 1979. In September 1979 Sarwari was involved in a pro-Nur Muhammad Taraki plot to oust Prime Minister Hafizullah Amin. After the failure of the plot, he and his comrades (the 'Gang of Four') escaped to the Soviet Embassy, where he was given asylum until the Soviet invasion and the fall of Amin in December 1979. After the invasion, under the government of Babrak Karmal, Sarwari was first given the task of deputy prime minister, but he was soon removed from the government and posted as ambassador to Mongolia from 1980 to 1986. In January 1980, Sarwari also became a member of the PDPA Politburo. In 1981, he was stripped of membership in the PDPA Politburo and was expelled from the party's Central Committee five years later in July 1986. President Mohammad Najibullah appointed him as ambassador to East Germany until 1988 and then South Yemen in 1989. Sarwari was expelled from the party following his alleged role in support of Shahnawaz Tanai's coup attempt in 1990. In May 1992, after the collapse of the Communist regime, Sarwari was arrested by the Shura-e Nazar militia of Ahmad Shah Massoud and was kept in detention in Panjshir. In 2005 he was transferred to the National Directorate of Security (NDS). Death sentence and imprisonment On December 25, 2005, he was charged with the involvement in the arbitrary arrest, torture and mass killing of hundreds of opponents during his tenure as head of Afghan intelligence for a period of one year. On February 25, 2006, he was sentenced to death by firing squad for ordering the killing of over 400 people; he was cleared of charges involving conspiracy against the post-Communist government. His was the first trial involving war crimes in Afghanistan in the post- Taliban era. The proceedings of the trial were condemned by the Amnesty International as \\"grossly unfair\\".

It opened in 1957 and was renovated in 1982. It is home to the Florida A&M; Rattlers football team. History Built in 1957, Bragg Memorial Stadium is home to Florida A&M; Football. The stadium is named in memory of two of the school's earliest figures in its storied intercollegiate athletic program‚Äîthe \\"First Family of Rattler Football\\"‚Äîthe father and son combination of Jubie and Eugene Bragg. Jubie Bragg was one of the school's first athletic directors, being one of the key figures in the football program gaining varsity status in 1906. He returned after a brief stint at Tuskegee to become the school's first head football coach and athletic director at FAMU from 1923 to 1925 and again from 1930 to 1932. Bragg's son, Eugene, one of the school's first All-America gridders (1927), took over the reins of the program in 1934, coaching through 1935, when an automobile accident ended his life. The original Bragg Stadium opened in 1947 and served as the home of Rattlers football from 1947 to 1956. Prior to 1947, Florida A&M;'s home football field was known as Sampson-Bragg Field. The original football field was located on a cow pasture south of the campus and then on a grass field, located on a hill directly behind the current Gaither Gymnasium, where the present track and field complex is located. The field was moved to that location, so that fans could use the bathroom facilities in the nearby dormitories. At the previous location in the cow pasture, it was a walk of a quarter mile to the nearest restroom. However, thanks to appropriations from the Florida Legislature, the all-steel stadium on the campus' westernmost edge was built in 1957. That configuration featured 10,500 permanent seats and bleachers elevated the capacity to 13,200. But by the 1980s, the stadium had fallen into disrepair and had grown too small for the Rattler football program. The 1980 season saw the stadium condemned by the State of Florida engineers, prompting the Legislature (thanks to heavy lobbying by the FAMU Administration) to appropriate over four and a half million dollars for the stadium's renovation and expansion to begin 1981 with remodeling, to make the stadium suitable for crowds again. To date, the largest single game attendance at Bragg Memorial Stadium was set in 1996 when 33,954 people were in attendance for the Homecoming football game against the Bears of Morgan State University. =Renovations= By 1982, the renovation and expansion had made the stadium a 25,500-seat facility with press box elevator, a $125,000 scoreboard with message center, a built-in sprinkler and drainage system, improved restroom, concessions and ticket booths and paved parking areas. The project was completed in 1983, with the unveiling of the Galimore-Powell Fieldhouse, located adjacent to the stadium's south end zone. On March 31, 2017, the Florida A&M; Athletics released information about an upcoming proposed renovation to Bragg Memorial Stadium. Upgrades would include, but may not be limited to: new coaches offices, meeting rooms, classrooms and a team meeting room totaling nearly . Additionally, renovations would fix certain structural issues that the stadium currently has, including repairing damaged columns in the stadium, as well as repairs to the stairs going into the stands. The proposed upgrades would also include an increase in seating from its current capacity at 25,500, to an improved 35,000, as well as the installation of 25 luxury suites and improvements to the fan experience, which could include better concession stands, retail sales areas and the inclusion of restaurants. No formal date has been set for construction to start on the facility; however, FAMU Athletics officials have stated funding for the improvements will be entirely from fundraising efforts. On June 26, 2018, Florida A&M; Athletics announced the installation of AstroTurf to the Stadium. It's set to be in place by the beginning of the 2018 season.http://www.famuathletics.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=25300&ATCLID;=211719301 The Jake Gaither Stadium Plan In January 2018 the university released plans to relocate its football stadium to the south side of the campus and renaming it Jake Gaither Stadium. The Jake Gaither Stadium will open to the rest of the new south campus. This new, state-of-the-art establishment will be half dug into the sloping terrain, with a series of terraces accenting the building, allowing for crowds to enter from the campus. During a game, fans have full 360-degree access to the concourse. Rising from the field in three tiers, this 35,000 seat stadium pulls fans as close to the field as possible while keeping optimal site lines. The stadium will remain flexible for other sports such as soccer and lacrosse while featuring 20 Leasable Luxury Suites, 4 Non-leasable University-Utilized Luxury Suites, 16 Lounge Boxes, 1,076 Premium Club Seats and 3,000 Priority Seats.http://constructtwo.com/pinnacle/buildings/ Features The structure contains coaches' offices, conference room, equipment and training/treatment rooms (with X-ray machines), two locker rooms, one for each team, home and visiting, plus an official's locker room and a weight training room.

Greene Stadium is a 7,086 seat (10,000-for football) multi-purpose stadium in Washington, D.C., in the United States, which opened in 1926. It is home to the Howard University Bison football and soccer teams. Originally called Howard Stadium, it was renamed William H. Greene Stadium in 1986 in honor of William H. Greene, M.D., a Washington, D.C., physician. Howard Stadium Where the stadium stands today was formerly a middle-class African- American neighborhood which was home to many Howard University faculty and workers.; Howard University completed its new Howard Stadium in July 1926. The first football game played there was on October 16, 1926, against Morehouse College. Howard played games at both Howard Stadium, sometimes referred to as University Stadium, and nearby Griffith Stadium, where crowds of 17,000 to 20,000 people were common, from the 1920s into the 1950s. (Griffith Stadium was demolished in 1965.) Afterward, Howard University played most of its home games at Howard Stadium, which by 1972 could hold 5,000 fans. After playing a single game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium every year from 1970 to 1973, Howard played every home game there in 1974 and 1975, all but one there in 1976, and half of them there in 1977. The Athletic Turf at Howard University. By 1977, Howard Stadium had been renovated and expanded to seat 9,000. That year, Howard University officials proposed constructing a 20,000-set stadium to replace the aging facility. Howard University officials admitted that Friday night football games did not draw large crowds, and the university could not get many Saturday afternoon games at RFK Stadium. (The Washington Redskins rented RFK Stadium, and a clause in their contract prohibited the playing of any game in the stadium 24 hours before a Redskins game.) In 1979, Howard University president James E. Cheek announced a plan to build a $14 million stadium and parking garage to replace Howard Stadium. The proposed stadium would seat 20,000. The university said it already had a design, and blueprints were being drafted. But nothing came of this plan. Though in 1985, after years of letting their field be known as the \\"dust bowl\\", the administration installed an astroturf field. A decade later, Howard University officials announced an even more grandiose plan. In 1986, the university proposed constructing a 30,000-seat domed stadium. An office building, retail space, and more than 1,200 apartments would be built as part of a \\"Howard Plaza\\" project on of abandoned and dilapidated property next to the campus. The Howard Plaza project had a $150 million price tag. The stadium alone, which was designed to host football and basketball games, would cost $75 million. Although the plan had the support of city officials, critics of the plan noted that Howard's football games only drew about 4,000 to 7,000 attendees. Residents of nearby LeDroit Park also opposed the plan.. William H. Greene Stadium The Scoreboard. Nothing came of the 1986 domed stadium plan. Instead, Howard Stadium was renovated in early 1986, and renamed William H. Greene Stadium. The project took 6 months and was dedicated in front of a homecoming game crowd of 18,635 on Oct 11, 1986. As of 2011, the team still played on an artificial surface. A track surrounds the playing field. Scoreboard (Back) In 1990, Howard University officials proposed to expand Greene Stadium by 6,000 seats in 1991 season. The plans called for enclosing the north end of the stadium, and moving the scoreboard to the south end. This would provide the stadium with a total of 14,000 seats, enabling the university to sell season tickets because it could guarantee preferential seating.. By 2010, however, Greene Stadium still had not been expanded or renovated. In a review of D.C. area stadiums in 2013, Brett Fuller, director of business development at the architectural firm AECOM, heavily criticized Greene Stadium for looking more like a high school field than a major college football stadium. As for the need for renovation, Fuller said, \\"It's hard to say it's in bad shape.

After several years in Tempe, he sought out a new career operating a movie-house. In 1933, he opened the State Theatre in Tempe, at the age of 18 after putting $50 down on the lease to take over the State Theatre. The State Theatre was originally the Goodwin Opera House, opened in 1907. http://www.azmusichalloffame.org/pages/bio_Dwight_Harkins.html = Early years = In 1934, Red Harkins built an outdoor theater in Tempe Beach Park, which lasted for only one summer. Afterwards, in 1940, Harkins built the College Theater (currently Harkins Valley Art). The theater contained innovations such as glow-in-the-dark carpet, headphones for the hearing impaired, and automatic drinking fountains. The theater is significant in that it is Tempe's only Depression-era theater. The last theater opened by Red Harkins was the \\"Camelview 5\\" theater in 1973.

Harkins Theatres struggled financially because it was unable to book many first-run movies. In 1977, Dan Harkins filed a lawsuit against a group of film distributors alleging they had prevented Harkins from booking many top first-run movie titles. Movie studios began settling with Harkins. As a result of the lawsuit, Harkins Theatres was able to show a run of Walt Disney's & RKO Radio Pictures Fantasia in May 1982, starting a string of successful releases.

W. Edward Jenkins, a North Carolina A&T; State University alumnus and architect, designed the stadium. Opened in 1981, the stadium is the home of the North Carolina A&T; State University Aggies football team and the Irwin Belk Olympic class track. In addition, Truist Stadium features a \\"Fitness and Wellness Center\\". This fitness facility sits behind the scoreboard in the stadium's northeastern corner. History Before the construction of Truist Stadium, North Carolina A&T; Aggies played their home football games at Greensboro‚Äôs War Memorial Stadium, which was also home to Greensboro's minor league baseball franchise. The university saw a great need to have an on campus stadium that could hold the growing number of fans attending home football games. The stadium was designed by architect W. Edward Jenkins, a North Carolina A&T; alumnus, and was constructed at a cost of more than $2.5 million. The stadium opened in 1981 and the first game played there was on September 12, 1981, against rival Winston Salem State University to an overflow crowd of more than 23,000 fans.Blue Death Valley: The History of Aggie Stadium To date, the largest single game attendance at Truist Stadium was set in 2001 when 34,769 people were in attendance for a football game against the Rattlers of Florida A&M; University. =Expansion and improvements= The \\"Aggievision\\" Scoreboard and Joseph & Kathleen Bryan Center In the North Endzone of Truist Stadium The original plans for the stadium called for a seating capacity of 20,000 people, but due to the increased cost of materials, the plan was scaled back to 17,500. For the first 14 years of operation, the stadium‚Äôs permanent seating capacity stood at 17,500. However, in 1995 the stadium underwent a major expansion in which 5,000 additional seats were added in the south end zone area to complete the current horseshoe shape and raise the seating capacity to over 21,000. In 1999 a donation by the Ford Motor Company allowed for the construction of stadium lights for night games and an electronic marquee outside the stadium grounds. In 2001, the university opened the Joseph and Kathleen Bryan Fitness and Wellness Center behind the stadium‚Äôs northeast end zone. Three years later, the Irwin Belk Track was finally completed. The facility is named after the former president of Belk Department Stores and a major financial contributor to the project. the Mondo Super X Performance track features eight 48-inch lanes and wide turns.Collegeovals.com During the 2004 off season, the scoreboard in the north endzone was removed and replaced with a digital scoreboard and replay screen from daktronics.

The most visible addition to Truist Stadium is the Sky Box complete with a Chancellor's Suite, facilities for press and coaches, as well as leasable luxury suites. The project was designed by Jason H. Jones, AIA, with Clark Nexsen's Charlotte Office, and was completed in April in time for the 2012 Football season.

Crounse was named in honor of Lorenzo Crounse, a former governor, State Supreme Court Justice, and congressman of Nebraska. Branched Oak Lake was created as part of the Salt Valley Lakes flood control project to prevent Salt Creek from flooding the nearby city of Lincoln.

Located midway between Tel Aviv and Haifa on the coastal plain near the city of Hadera, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof HaCarmel Regional Council. With a population of , it is the only Israeli locality managed by a private organization, the Caesarea Development Corporation,About the CDC and also one of the most populous localities not recognized as a local council. The ancient city of Caesarea Maritima was built by Herod the Great about 25‚Äì13 BCE as a major port. It served as an administrative center of Judaea Province of the Roman Empire, and later as the capital of the Byzantine Palaestina Prima province. During the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, it was the last city of the Holy Land to fall to the Arabs. The city degraded to a small village after the provincial capital was moved from here to Ramleh and had an Arab majority until Crusader conquest. Under the Crusaders it became once again a major port and a fortified city. It was diminished after the Mamluk conquest. In 1884, Bosniak immigrants settled there establishing a small fishing village. In 1940, kibbutz Sdot Yam was established next to the Bosniak village. In February 1948, the Bosniak village was conquered by a Palmach unit commanded by Yitzhak Rabin, its people already having fled following an earlier attack by the Lehi paramilitary group. In 1952, the modern Jewish town of Caesarea was established near the ruins of the old city, which in 2011 were incorporated into the newly created Caesarea National Park.

For more about the Classical Era, Early Muslim, Crusader and Late Muslim periods before the resettlement in the 19th century, see here [‚Üí] in the history chapter of the Caesarea Maritima article. =Late Ottoman Qisarya (est. 1884)= Caesarea lay in ruins until the nineteenth century, when the village of Qisarya () was established in 1884 by Bushnaks (Bosniaks) ‚Äì immigrants from Bosnia, who built a small fishing village on the ruins of the fortified Crusader city.Oliphant, 1887, p. 182 A population list from about 1887 showed that Caesarea had 670 Muslim inhabitants, in addition to 265 Muslim inhabitants, who were noted as \\"Bosniaks‚Äù.Schumacher, 1888, p. 181 Petersen, visiting the place in 1992, writes that the nineteenth-century houses were built in blocks, generally one story high (with the exception of the house of the governor.) Some houses on the western side of the village, near the sea, have survived. There were a number of mosques in the village in the nineteenth century, but only one (\\"The Bosnian mosque\\") has survived. This mosque, located at the southern end of the city, next to the harbour, is described as a simple stone building with a red-tiled roof and a cylindrical minaret. In 1992 it was used as a restaurant and as a gift shop.Petersen, 2001, pp. 129-130 =British Mandate of Palestine= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Caesarea had a population of 346; 288 Muslims, 32 Christians and 26 Jews,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. 34 where the Christians were 6 Orthodox, 3 Syrian Orthodox, 3 Roman Catholics, 4 Melkites, 2 Syrian Catholics and 14 Maronite.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 49 The population had increased in the 1931 census to 706; 19 Christians, 4 Druse and 683 Muslims, in a total of 143 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 95 A Jewish settlement, Kibbutz Sdot Yam, was established south of the Muslim town in 1940. The Muslim village declined in economic importance and many of Qisarya's Muslim inhabitants left in the mid-1940s, when the British extended the Palestine Railways which bypassed the shallow-draft port.

In December 1947 a village notable, Tawfiq Kadkuda, approached local Jews in an effort to establish a non-belligerency agreement.Morris, 2004, p. 92 The 31 January 1948 Lehi attack on a bus leaving Qisarya, which killed two and injured six people, precipitated an evacuation of most of the population, who fled to nearby al- Tantura.Morris, 2004, p. 130 The Haganah then occupied the village because the land was owned by the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association and, fearing that the British would force them to leave, decided to demolish the houses. This was done on February 19‚Äì20, after the remaining residents were expelled and the houses were looted. According to Benny Morris, the expulsion of the population had more to do with illegal Jewish immigration than the ongoing civil war.Morris, 2008, pp. 94‚Äì95. In the same month the 'Arab al Sufsafi and Saidun Bedouin, who inhabited the dunes between Qisarya and Pardes left the area.Morris, 2004, p. 129 Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village remains in 1992: \\"Most of the houses have been demolished. The site has been excavated in recent years, largely by Italian, American, and Israeli teams, and turned into a tourist area. Most of the few remaining houses are now restaurants, and the village mosque has been converted into a bar.\\"Khalidi, 1992, p.184 =State of Israel= Dan Hotel Rothschild Caesarea Foundation and Development Corporation After the establishment of the State of Israel, the Rothschild family agreed to transfer most of its land holdings to the new state. A different arrangement was reached for the 35,000 dunams of land the family owned in and around modern Caesarea: after turning over the land to the state, it was leased back (for a period of 200 years) to a new charitable foundation. In his will, Edmond James de Rothschild stipulated that this foundation would further education, arts and culture, and welfare in Israel. The Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation was formed and run based on the funds generated by the sale of Caesarea land which the Foundation is responsible for maintaining. The Foundation is owned half by the Rothschild family, and half by the State of Israel. The Rothschild Caesarea Foundation established the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Development Corporation Ltd. (CDC; Hebrew: ◊î◊ó◊ë◊®◊î ◊ú◊§◊ô◊™◊ï◊ó ◊ß◊ô◊°◊®◊ô◊î ◊ê◊ì◊û◊ï◊†◊ì ◊ë◊†◊ô◊û◊ô◊ü ◊ì◊î ◊®◊ï◊ò◊©◊ô◊ú◊ì) in 1952 to act as its operations arm. The company transfers all profits from the development of Caesarea to the Foundation, which in turn contributes to organizations that advance higher education and culture across Israel. The goal of the CDC is to establish a unique community that combines quality of life and safeguarding the environment with advanced industry and tourism. Today, the Chairman of the Rothschild Caesarea Foundation and the CDC is Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the great-grandson of Baron Edmond de Rothschild. As well as carrying out municipal services, the CDC markets plots for real-estate development, manages the nearby industrial park, and runs the Caesarea's golf course and country club, Israel's only 18-hole golf course. Kesariya's character Modern Caesarea, or Kesariya, remains today the only locality in Israel managed by a private organization rather than a municipal government. It is one of Israel's most upscale residential communities. The Baron de Rothschild still maintains a home in Caesarea, as do many business tycoons from Israel and abroad. Location and structure of modern Keisariya Modern Keisariya, located adjacent to ancient Caesarea, is located on the Israeli coastal plain, approximately halfway between the major modern cities of Tel Aviv ( to the south) and Haifa ( to the north). Caesarea is situated approximately northwest of the city of Hadera, and is bordered to the east by the Caesarea Industrial Zone and the city of Or Akiva. Directly to the north of Caesarea is the town of Jisr az-Zarqa. Keisariya is divided into a number of residential zones, known as clusters. The most recent of these to be constructed is Cluster 13, which, like all the clusters, is given a name: in this case, \\"The Golf Cluster\\", due to its close proximity to the Caesarea Golf Course. The golfcourse was built upon an ancient Arab town on the site of a loosely grouped Egyptian and subsequently Greek structures, with archaeological remains. These neighborhoods are affluent, although they vary significantly in terms of average plot size. Economy Caesarea is a suburban community with a number of residents commuting to work in Tel Aviv or Haifa. The Caesarea Business Park is on the fringe of the city. About 170 companies are in the park; they employ about 5,500 people. Industry in the park includes distribution and high-technology services. The residential neighborhoods have a shopping concourse with a newsagent, supermarket, optician, and bank. A number of restaurants and cafes are scattered across the town, with a number within the ancient port. Infrastructure =Roads= * 30px Beyond the eastern boundary of the residential area of Caesarea is Highway 2, Israel's main highway linking Tel Aviv to Haifa. Caesarea is linked to the road by the Caesarea Interchange in the south, and Or Akiva Interchange in the center. * 30pxSlightly further to the east lies Highway 4, providing more local links to Hadera, Binyamina, Zichron Yaakov, and the moshavim and kibbutzim of Emek Hefer. * 30px Highway 65 starts at the Caesarea Interchange and runs westwards into the Galilee and the cities of Pardes Hanna-Karkur, Umm al-Fahm, and Afula. =Rail= Caesarea shares a railway station with nearby Pardes Hanna-Karkur, which is situated in the Caesarea Industrial Zone and is served by the suburban line between Binyamina and Tel Aviv, with two trains per hour. The Binyamina Railway Station, a major regional transfer station, is also located nearby. Culture Ralli Museum in Caesarea Theatre of Caesarea Maritima in front of the Mediterranean The Roman theatre, located at the site, often hosts concerts by major Israeli and international artists, such as Shlomo Artzi, Yehudit Ravitz, Mashina, Deep Purple, Bj√∂rk, and others. In recent years, the port has become home to the annual Caesarea Jazz Festival, which offers three evenings of top-class jazz performances by leading international artists. The Ralli Museum in Caesarea houses a large collection of South American art and several Salvador Dal√≠ originals.  Sports  Caesarea has the country's only full-sized golf course.Golf Digest magazine, May 2010 The idea for the Caesarea Golf and Country Club originated after James de Rothschild was reminded by the dunes surrounding Caesarea of Scotland's sandy links golf courses. Upon his death, the James de Rothschild Foundation established the course. In 1958, a Golf Club Committee was established, and a course was built. American professional golfer Herman Barron, the first Jewish golfer to win a PGA Tour event, helped develop the course.Herman Barron bio page on International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame website It was officially opened in 1961 by Abba Eban. The Caesarea Golf Club has hosted international golf competitions every four years in the Maccabiah Games. The course was redesigned and rebuilt by golf course designer Pete Dye in 2007‚Äì2009.

It is located on the Petersberg, a prominent mountain of the Siebengebirge near Bonn, Germany. With a height of , it overlooks the cities of K√∂nigswinter, on the right bank of the Rhine river, and Bonn on the opposite side. History Day-time view from the Petersberg across Rhine to Bonn In 1834 the area was sold to the merchant Joseph Ludwig Mertens. His wife Sibylle Mertens-Schaafhausen built a summer residence on the Petersberg, and became known as the Rheingr√§fin (\\"countess of the Rhine\\"). At the end of the 19th century the Nelles brothers from Cologne had bought the area and started to add buildings. In 1892 they opened up the eponymous hotel that could easily be reached via the newly built Petersbergbahn, a rack railway that continued in intermittent operation until 1958. In 1912 Ferdinand M√ºlhens' rack and pinion railway, owner of the 4711 company, bought the property. Under the direction of the architect Heinrich M√ºller-Erkelenz the hotel was converted during the next two years into a spa. Terraces to overlook the Rhine and a new access route were built in the 1930s. =Seat of Allied High Commission= After World War II the Hotel Petersberg became the seat of the Allied High Commission for Germany. The Occupation Statute was issued here on September 21, 1949. Several weeks later, November 22, 1949, the Petersberg Agreement was signed between Chancellor Adenauer and the Western Allies. The Allied High Commission resided on the Petersberg until 1955, when West Germany gained its sovereignty. =The Federal Guest House= Dawn view from Petersberg into Rhine valley The German Federal government needed to host foreign guests and by 1955 started to rent out the Hotel Petersberg (then managed by the Hotel Breidenbacher Hof of D√ºsseldorf). When the lease expired in 1969, the Hotel Petersberg quickly ran into economic difficulties and was closed shortly thereafter. The buildings were then maintained only as far as preventing them from falling into ruin. In 1978, the government bought the Petersberg with its buildings from the M√ºlhens family for 18.5 million DM to develop a representative guest house for its visitors. A five-year reconstruction was completed in 1990 following the plans of Horst Linde. Most heads of states that visited the Federal Republic, while Bonn was its capital, have stayed on the Petersberg. A helicopter pad provides easy access. The fact that the mountain has only one access road facilitates security matters. Renovations took place 2017-18. After the German government moved to Berlin, the Petersberg continued in use as an official guest and conference house and has been dubbed the \\"German Camp David.\\" In December 2001 the Petersberg was the place of the first Bonn Agreement. Also its follow-up conference took place here on December 2, 2002. The Hotel is open to the public and managed by the Steigenberger Hotel Group that was rebranded as Deutsche Hospitality in 2016. Michael Schumacher married his wife Corinna on the Petersberg in 1995. Daniela Katzenberger and Lucas Cordalis got married at the hotel in 2016.

McNamee was arrested on 16 August 1986 at his home in Crossmaglen by the British Army and Royal Ulster Constabulary, then flown to London and charged with conspiracy to cause explosions. At his trial at the Old Bailey, he denied even having sympathy for the IRA, and no evidence was ever presented that he had any paramilitary links. Additionally, the IRA itself stated that he was not a member, and never claimed him as a \\"prisoner of war\\". However, his fingerprint was found on electronic circuits in an arms cache that was linked to the Hyde Park bombing. At his trial, he explained that he may have handled the circuits when working for a previous employer, who he did not know had IRA connections. After five hours of deliberation by the jury, McNamee was found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In September 1994, McNamee and Paul Magee were among six prisoners who escaped from Whitemoor Prison, shooting and wounding a prison officer as they did so, before being captured two hours later. In 1997, his case was examined by Channel 4's Trial and Error programme. McNamee was later to be the first case referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and his conviction was overturned on 17 December 1998, because of other, much more prominent, fingerprints on the same circuits, belonging to known IRA bomb-maker Dessie Ellis (who received a ten-year sentence in Ireland for possession of explosives after the bombings, but before MacNamee's trial), which were not disclosed at McNamee's original trial. Despite quashing McNamee's conviction, the appeal judges stated, \\"The Crown makes a strong case that the appellant [McNamee] was guilty of a conspiracy to cause explosions.\\" Supporters of the campaign to clear his name included the comedian Jeremy Hardy. In February 1999, McNamee read the IRA Roll of Honour at the Burns and Moley commemoration and the following month he sat with the Caraher family during the trial of Michael Caraher and other members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade sniper team.
