While Newmarket was considerably smaller than any of the three cities in the southern part of the York region, it had a quality transit service. Service on some of the routes was provided until midnight, with 15-minute service provided on trunk routes (55A, 55B) during rush hours. Newmarket Transit was merged with York Region's other services to form York Region Transit in 2001. Newmarket Transit began sometime in the early 1970s as a contracted service from the town replacing the Newmarket Town Bus (c. 1958 and renamed from the Newmarket Bus Lines c. 1948). Routes Newmarket Transit routes with other transit services in \\"upper\\" York Region. Fall 1998 - Summer 1999. Originally Newmarket Transit used to operate only 4 routes, denoted as A, B, C, D. Those routes were later renumbered 11, 22, 33 and 44. Route 55, a trunk route from Newmarket Bus Terminal to the 404 Plaza, was eventually added and included 2 branches - 55A via Davis Drive and 55B via Gorham and Eagle streets which were interlined during late evening and weekend service. As the city expanded, routes 66 and 77 were added to service the new developments west of Yonge Street (route 66) and south-east of Mulock Drive (route 77). Routes 22 and 33 were cancelled in mid-1990s with the remaining routes adjusted slightly to partially compensate for the lost services. In 1998 Newmarket Transit restructured its routes to provide direct service to major destinations. * Route 55C was added to provide direct service on Mulock Drive between Yonge Street and Leslie Street. * Routes 11 and 77 were combined into a single route 77/11 which provided one-way circular service on major streets in eastern part of Newmarket. This route was later extended south on Bayview avenue to connect with Aurora Transit. * Routes 44 and 66 were restructured to provide service in south-west and north-west parts of the town. While the routes were interlined and the schedule listed them as '44/66' and '66/44', those in fact remained two separate routes. In the fall of 1999 Newmarket Transit assumed the responsibilities over the public transit in the neighboring town of Aurora, restructuring the old circular route into two community bus routes: A1 and A2. Following the merger of the four transit systems, York Region Transit introduced its own route numbers in 2002. * Route 44 retained its number.

(Later changed to 57A.) * Route 66 retained its number for a couple of years, then it was absorbed by the route 57A. * Route 77/11 became route 33. Couple years later the route was split and the services were incorporated into route 54 (Bayview Avenue), route 57 (Stonehaven Avenue) and route 55 (branch 55B, servicing the area north of Davis drive).

However, this station became inconvenient after an extension to opened on 27 June 1846. The new railway met the Brighton line at a junction just west of Lewes Station (i.e. towards Brighton), requiring trains serving Lewes to reverse. The director of the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway called the station \\"the most incomplete and injudicious station ever erected\\". On 2 October 1847, the Keymer Junction to Lewes line opened. New platforms (called Pinwell) were built opposite the terminus, west of the Hasting line branch. On 1 November 1857, a new station was built at the divergence of the Keymer Junction line. The old station closed; the original booking hall with grand classical columns outside survived until the 1960s before it was demolished. The new building was built in the style of a Swiss chalet. A new junction for the realigned Wealden Line opened on 1 October 1868. The new alignment went through part of the station goods yard of the original terminus. Before this change, the Wealden line joined the Keymer line at Hamsey Junction between the north portal of Lewes Tunnel and Cooksbridge Station. The second station was rebuilt in order to increase platform capacity and reduce the narrow curvature of the track. It opened on 17 June 1889. On 1 October 1889 all passenger services were diverted from the original loop line between Lewes and Southerham Junction onto this alignment. The original route was retained for goods only. On 5 November 1960, severe flooding of the track caused the suspension of all electric services, and replaced by whatever steam locomotives were available. The Borough Surveyor requested that the London-bound platforms at Lewes station should be blown up to allow flood water to escape via the railway track-bed. However, the British Railways district engineer declined to co- operate. The line to remained inoperable for some time. In the 1960s, the original 1846 terminus building fronting the public street (Friars Walk), was demolished.plate 48, Brighton to Eastbourne by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press, 1985, maps opposite plate 50, Brighton to Eastbourne by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press, 1985, London, Brighton & South Coast Railway Album, Klaus Marx, Ian Allan, 1982, The line to Uckfield closed on 23 February 1969, in order that a relief road in Lewes could be built over the redundant trackbed.

From July 2014 till June 2015 he was a member of the Dutch Senate. In the European Parliament he was a substitute for the Committee on Foreign Affairs and a member of the Delegation to the EU-Croatia Joint Parliamentary Committee.  Biography  In 1999 European Parliament elections Meijer won the first seat for the SP in the European Parliament. Born in 1944 in Amsterdam, Meijer, who lives in Rotterdam, studied human geography and later taught geography before becoming a civil servant. Politically active since the beginning of the 1960s, including as an executive member of Socialist Youth (SJ), in the 1970s he was elected to represent the Pacifist Socialist Party (PSP) on Amsterdam City Council. During this period he led the Proletarian Left within the PSP, which later split to form what now is Socialist Alternative Politics. Meijer stayed within the PSP. From 1982 to 1995 he served as member of the States-Provincial of South Holland, having been elected on a combined PSP-CPN-PPR ticket. Following the formation of the GreenLeft, which united these tendencies, he became the party's national vice-chair, a position which he held until 1995. At the beginning of 1996, Meijer left Green Left for the SP. In 1998 he became chair of the SP branch in Delfshaven, a poor district of Rotterdam, at the same time working to build up the party's European contacts. In the European Parliament the SP forms part of the United Left Group (GUE-NGL). The party's priority is resistance to the development of a European Superstate too far removed from the people and too closely attached to the interests of European multinationals. In the European elections of 10 June 2004, the SP's electoral support grew from 5% to 7%, giving the party a second seat. Re-elected, Meijer was joined by Kartika Liotard. His comments in the Skopje daily Utrinski Vesnik on 14 January 2008 drew the ire of readers in the Republic of Macedonia. He said that the country should tear down statues of the ancient Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great erected on its territory and agree to a name change in its bilateral dispute with Greece. He was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau on 8 September 2009. On 8 July 2014 he was made member of the Dutch Senate, replacing Arjan Vliegenthart. His term ended on 9 June 2015. As he was nr 13 on the list of candidates and as currently nr 11 of the list for the Dutch Senate, Mr Meijer has a chance of entering the senate again in case two sitting Members resign before June 2019.

Such events are intended to honor a specific individual in a unique way. In addition to jokes and insult comedy, such events may also involve genuine praise and tributes. The implication is that the roastee is able to take the jokes in good humor and not as serious criticism or insult. The individual is surrounded by friends, fans, and well-wishers, who can receive some of the same treatment as well during the course of the evening. The party and presentation itself are both referred to as a \\"roast\\". The host of the event is called the \\"roastmaster\\". Anyone who is mocked in such a way is said to have been \\"roasted\\". The Friars Club In 1949, the New York Friars Club held their first roast, with Maurice Chevalier as the guest of honor. Televised roasts =Kraft Music Hall= The final few seasons of the television show Kraft Music Hall, from 1968 to 1971, included broadcasts of the Friars Club Roast; the celebrities roasted included Johnny Carson, Milton Berle, Jack Benny, Don Rickles, and Jerry Lewis. =Dean Martin's Celebrity Roasts= Dean Martin hosted a series of roasts on television in 1974 as part of the final season of his self-titled variety show. After the show was cancelled, NBC decided to schedule a series of The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast specials from the former MGM Grand Hotel and Casino (now Bally's Las Vegas) in the Ziegfeld Room; these were recorded and aired approximately once every two months from late 1974 to early 1979, and another three were produced in 1984. The celebrities roasted included actors Kirk Douglas, Bette Davis, and Jimmy Stewart; athletes Muhammad Ali, Joe Namath, and Wilt Chamberlain; comedians Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, and Redd Foxx; politicians Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater; and singers Frank Sinatra and Martin himself. The humor at these broadcast tributes was far tamer than the sometimes extremely vulgar and explicit language of the private, non-televised ones. =Comedy Central= From 1998 to 2002, the cable channel Comedy Central produced and broadcast the annual roast of the New York Friars Club, with roasts of the celebrities Drew Carey, Jerry Stiller, Rob Reiner, Hugh Hefner, and Chevy Chase. Based on the success of these roasts, Comedy Central began hosting their own roasts on an approximately annual basis, under the name Comedy Central Roast. The first roastee was Denis Leary in 2003, followed by Jeff Foxworthy, Pamela Anderson, William Shatner, Flavor Flav, Bob Saget, Larry the Cable Guy, Joan Rivers, David Hasselhoff, Donald Trump, Charlie Sheen, Roseanne Barr, James Franco, Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Bruce Willis, and Alec Baldwin. Comedian Jeff Ross notably gained fame through his participation in the televised Comedy Central roasts, and is frequently referred to as the \\"Roastmaster General\\" (a position he in fact holds with the New York Friars' Club). In 2010, Comedy Central's international affiliates began to produce and air their own local roasts as well. Comedy Central New Zealand has aired roasts of Mike King and Murray Mexted, Comedy Central Africa has aired roasts of Steve Hofmeyr, Kenny Kunene, Somizi Mhlongo and AKA, Comedy Central Latin America has aired a roast of Héctor Suárez, Comedy Central Spain has aired roasts of Santiago Segura, El Gran Wyoming and José Mota, and Comedy Central Netherlands has aired roasts of Gordon (which was the highest-watched broadcast in the history of the channel), Giel Beelen, Johnny de Mol and Ali B.. =Other televised roasts in the United States= The fourth episode of The Richard Pryor Show produced a roast of Richard Pryor in 1977. Playboy produced one roast in 1986, of Tommy Chong, which aired on the Playboy Channel. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal produced two editions of his Shaq's All Star Comedy Roast: of himself in 2002, and of Emmitt Smith in 2003. The cable channel MTV produced one roast in 2003, of Carson Daly, which was billed as the MTV Bash. The cable channel TBS produced one roast in 2008, of Cheech & Chong, which was billed as Cheech & Chong: Roasted. The cable channel A&E; produced one roast in 2008, of Gene Simmons. The magazine Guitar World organized three \\"Rock & Roll Roasts\\" from 2012 to 2014, of musicians Zakk Wylde, Dee Snider, and Corey Taylor. A Friars Club roast of Terry Bradshaw was broadcast on ESPN2 in 2015. The cable channel Fusion aired a roast of Snoop Dogg in 2016, billed as the Snoop Dogg Smokeout. RuPaul's Drag Race has aired four roast-themed episodes: A roast of RuPaul in season 5 in 2013 and in RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race in 2020, a roast of Michelle Visage in season 9 in 2017, and a mock-funeral roast of Lady Bunny in season 4 of All-Stars in 2019. The cable channel TNT aired a roast of the anchors of the TNT show Inside the NBA in 2020. =United Kingdom= Some attempts have been made to adapt the American roast format to a British audience. Channel 4 launched the latest British version on April 7, 2010 with A Comedy Roast, with initial victims being Bruce Forsyth, Sharon Osbourne, and Chris Tarrant. Davina McCall and Barbara Windsor were other victims. However, more suited to the British sense of humour has been the “wildly successful” Roast Battle format which was announced to have been commissioned for a third series in September 2018. =India= The Indian comedy group All India Bakchod organized the live show AIB Knockout in January 2015 featuring Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh with Karan Johar as the roastmaster. The programme caused a controversy for allegedly featuring distasteful, sexist, offending and humiliating content. Videos of the event were removed from YouTube, and the state is contemplating a clamp down on future AIB Knockouts, following legal action by some viewers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EinuOwzmFos Comedy Nights Bachao by Optimystix production is also based on this format; however, they avoid going too racy to keep the show family friendly. =China= Artists and producers working for Shanghai Xiao Guo Culture Co. Ltd., started importing foreign stand-up comedy formats since 2012. Roast!, a Chinese version of Comedy Central Roasts, has reached 2.33 billion hits on Tencent's video streaming platform, according to Tencent-backed Maoyan, a movie and TV site. Roast! differs in that, instead of a single annual special, it consists of annual seasons of 10 shows with a different celebrity victim each week (season one contains 11 including a triple-length Chinese New Year special). Its offspring, web show Rock & Roast, has also become a hit in China, with 70 million viewers in its 2019 season a steady increase from 50 million from its prior season. =Fictional roasts= Roasts have sometimes been portrayed in fictional TV shows. In other cases, standalone roasts have been produced of historical characters, with both roastee and roasters played by actors. The 1997 episode \\"The Roast\\" of the series The Larry Sanders Show revolved around a roast of the title character. The theme of one of the episodes (Season 5 episode 15) of the NBC sitcom Parks and Recreation was the main character Leslie Knope roasting the media of the fictional town of Pawnee in a local correspondents lunch. In the 2009 episode \\"Stress Relief\\" of The Office, main character Michael Scott organizes a roast of himself. The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast aired one fictional roast, of George Washington (played by Jan Leighton), on March 15, 1974. The 2019 Netflix series Historical Roasts, hosted by Jeff Ross, featured roasts of historical figures Abraham Lincoln (played by Bob Saget), Freddie Mercury (James Adomian), Anne Frank (Rachel Feinstein), Martin Luther King Jr. (Jerry Minor), Cleopatra (Ayden Mayeri) and Muhammad Ali (Jaleel White). In politics The White House Correspondents' Association and Radio and Television Correspondents' Association have annual dinners that, in some years, feature a comedy roasting of the U.S. President. Don Imus at the RTCA in 1996, Stephen Colbert in 2006 and Michelle Wolf in 2018 have received particular attention for their biting remarks during their speeches. During presidential election years in the U.S., it is customary for both major party candidates to attend the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, typically engaging in a roast of each other, and occasionally themselves.

Hair spray (also hair lacquer or spritz) is a common cosmetic hairstyling product that is sprayed onto hair to protect against humidity and wind. Hair sprays typically consist of several components for the hair as well as a propellant.  Ingredients and operation  Hair sprays consist of the following components: concentrate, plasticizers, luster agents, and fragrances, as well as propellants. Polyvinylpyrrolidone is a common component of hair spray that confers stiffness to hair. =Concentrate= Hair spray are a blend of polymers that provide structural support to hair. These frequently include copolymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc). Vinyl acetate-crotonic acid copolymers give harder films. In this way hairsprays can be formulated as flexible, medium, and maximum hold.Victoria Sherrow, \\"Hairspray.\\" Encyclopedia of Hair: A Cultural History. The copolymer mixture is usually adjusted to achieve the desired physical properties (adhesive strength, foaming, etc.), using plasticizers such as aminomethyl propanol, surfactants such as benzalkonium chloride, and other agents like dimethicone. =Propellants= Since the phase-out of CFCs in the 1980s, hydrocarbons are popular propellants. These include propane, butane, isobutane, and related volatile hydrocarbons, as well as other mixtures. Such hydrocarbons are poor solvents for the active ingredients such as the polymers. For this reason dimethyl ether is often added as well. It functions both as a propellant and a solvent. =Other components= Plasticizers used in hair spray include esters of citric acid and adipic acid. Silicones and polyglycols are also used. The concentrate comprises only a small volume of a can of hairspray. Most of a canister is filled solvents such as isopropanol (rubbing alcohol) and ethanol.  History  Early hair sprays were developed in Europe in the 1920s. In the US, hair sprays were developed around the time of the aerosol can in the 1940s, and the first patents describing copolymers for hair styling were published in the 1940s. In the US, the first to package it was Chase products (an aerosol manufacturer) in 1948, as the beauty industry saw that the aerosol cans used in World War II for insecticides could be used as a dispenser for hairspray.Liz Suman. \\"The History of Hairspray.\\" About.com. N.p., n.d. Web. It thrived and became increasingly popular and mass-produced, as updos and other such hairstyles were created. By 1964, it became the highest selling beauty product on the market. In 1968 at the feminist Miss America protest, protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \\"Freedom Trash Can.\\" These included hairspray, which was among items the protestors called \\"instruments of female torture\\" and accoutrements of what they perceived to be enforced femininity. Sales of hairspray declined in the 1970s as hairstyles became predominately worn straight and loose. By the 1980s, hairspray’s popularity came back as big hairstyles resurged with the glam metal scene. Prior to 1979, the most popular propellants in hairsprays were CFCs. Owing to environmental concerns, they were replaced.

The emergency, which was renewed in 2016 for the 36th year, is the \\"oldest existing state of emergency.\\" The renewal of the emergency state with respect to Iran was equal to continuation of non-nuclear US sanctions against Iran. By 2014, this state of emergency was among 30 others which US was dealing with. According to Gregory Korte of USA Today, this state of emergency gives \\"extra ordinary powers\\" to the president to \\"seize property, call up the National Guard and hire and fire military officers at will,\\" since it is declared by executive order. The language of such declarations are \\"nearly apocalyptic,\\" according to the USA Today. Although bound by law to review the emergence declarations, Congress provides little \\"oversight\\" on them, said Korte. Renewals =2016= By 2016 (the year the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was implemented), some of the executive orders issued pursuant to the declared national emergency were terminated. However, the situation was extended by President Barack Obama for an additional year, as he believed that US relations with Iran had not yet returned to normal, and the process of implementing the agreements with Iran, dated Jan. 19, 1981, Algiers Accords, had not been fully implanted. \\"Despite the historic deal to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program, certain actions and policies of the Government of Iran continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States,\\" wrote Obama in his letter to the Congress. Most of the U.S. sanctions against Iran are legally originated from this state of emergency. This renewal meant that \\"non-nuclear US sanctions against Iran will remain in effect for at least another year.\\" =2017= On November 6, 2017, President Donald Trump extended the national emergency for another year and wrote a letter to Congress.

His work is known for its storytelling, its left-liberal social commentary, its criticism of reactionary right-wing politics and organized religion. Formerly a regular contributor to The Nation, New York Magazine and The Atlantic, his work is today seen more frequently in Vanity Fair. He has been hailed by The New York Times as \\"one of America's foremost political satirists\\".Grimes, William. \\"Art; The Gripes of Wrath: 25 Years of Edward Sorel\\". The New York Times.

There is also a large body of work which is nostalgic for the stars of 1930s and 1940s Hollywood when Sorel was a youth. Sorel is noted for his wavy pen-and- ink style, which he describes as \\"spontaneous direct drawing\\".\\"Edward Sorel,\\" Hall of Fame biography Early life Sorel was born and grew up in The Bronx, the son of Jewish immigrants. His father was a door-to-door dry goods salesman, while his mother worked full-time in a hatmaking factory. Sorel became serious about drawing when a case of double pneumonia confined him to bed for nearly a year. He attended the High School of Music & Art, and graduated from the Cooper Union in 1951. As he explains in Mary Astor's Purple Diary, he took his name from the character Julien Sorel of The Red and the Black by Stendhal, with whom he felt akin because both hated their fathers, the clergy and the corrupt society of their time.\\"Interview: Edward Sorel and a Grand Career in Illustration\\" by Henry Chamberlain, Comics Grinder, February 12, 2017 Career Sorel was a co-founder of Push Pin Studios with Milton Glaser, Seymour Chwast, and Reynold Ruffins in 1953.

His first published illustration was A War for Civilization was sold to the satirical magazine The Realist;Paul Krassner (2005) One hand jerking: reports from an investigative satirist, p.33 in 1961. He then sold the magazine a cartoon satirizing the glamor of the Kennedy family, an early example of his parody movie posters. Victor Navasky appointed him art director for the satirical magazine Monocle in 1963. In the later 1960s he produced full-color satirical bestiaries for the left-wing Ramparts, and a series called “Sorel’s Unfamiliar Quotations” for The Atlantic. A profile of Sorel in Time 15 October 1968 was instrumental in selling “Sorel’s News Service” by King Features to 44 syndicated newspapers for 14 months from later 1969 through 1970. Clay Felker founded New York magazine in the late 1960s and Sorel was a regular contributor, becoming art director in the late 1970s. Sorel also contributed covers and features to early issues of National Lampoon. When Felker bought the Village Voice in 1974 Sorel was given a weekly spot there, which lasted for most of the 1970s. By the mid-1980s Sorel moved to The Nation, now edited by his old colleague Navasky, and to which he contributed for the next decade. Sorel joined The New Yorker in late 1992 contributing a cover to the first issue edited by new editor Tina Brown. He has contributed many illustrations, features, and 44 covers to The New Yorker. He has contributed many features to Vanity Fair. His art has also appeared on the covers of Harper's Magazine, Fortune, Forbes, Esquire, Time, American Heritage, Atlantic Monthly. Sorel also had a lengthy association with Penthouse, often lavishly reworking earlier drawings and ideas from his work for The Village Voice and The Nation. In 2007 he completed the celebrated mural for the Waverly Inn in New York's Greenwich Village, which was published as a book, The Mural at the Waverly Inn in 2008. In 2009 he completed the mural for the redesigned Monkey Bar Restaurant in New York City. As a writer, Sorel has reviewed books and exhibitions of fellow cartoonists and illustrators for such publications as The New York Times, The New York Observer, and American Heritage magazine. In February 2010 he was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In 2016, Sorel published \\"Mary Astor's Purple Diary,\\" which was received with praise. In late December 2016, Sorel received rave book review by Woody Allen.

Plot Steve Grayson is a generous NASCAR race car driver with a heart of gold who feels compelled to bail friends and acquaintances out of financial hardship. However, Steve's manager Kenny Donford, a compulsive gambler, had been mismanaging Steve's winnings to support his gambling habits, landing Steve in deep trouble with the IRS for nonpayment of back taxes and causing many of Steve's valuable possessions to be repossessed. This proves to be a problem for Steve in his efforts to continue racing competitively and support those who depend on his intense generosity. Susan Jacks is the IRS agent assigned to keep tabs on Steve and apply his future prize money toward his $150,000 debt, but she ends up taking a romantic interest in him as well. This movie is loosely based on Colonel Tom Parker and his gambling habit and the money he continually siphoned from Elvis.

Petula Clark first and next Annette Funicello were offered the lead female role, both turned it down. Filming began on 26 June 1967. Scenes were shot at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord, North Carolina. The film features guest appearances by several of the top stock-car—better known now as NASCAR—drivers of the day including Richard Petty, Buddy Baker, Cale Yarborough, Tiny Lund and more. They were shown individually with their names in the film's opening credits. This would be the final \\"formula\\" musical film of Presley's career. His remaining films would be less musical and more adult in tone. Steve Grayson's generosity portrayed in the film was based loosely on Elvis' real-life generosity, in which Elvis would give cars, homes, and other expensive items to Memphis Mafia members, family and friends, and even total strangers. Release Although the film was completed in the early summer of 1967, it was not released in theaters until June 1968. It was a box-office success placing at #40 for the year on the Variety weekly national box office list. The only guitar to be featured in the film is during one of the film's closing scenes, during the performance of \\"There Ain't Nothing Like A Song\\", where a sunburst Fender Coronado is used. Soundtrack Reception By 1968, Presley films had long become formulaic. Renata Adler of The New York Times wrote that Speedway was \\"just another Presley movie — which makes no great use at all of one of the most talented, important and durable performers of our time. Music, youth and customs were much changed by Elvis Presley 12 years ago; from the 26 movies he has made since he sang \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" you would never guess it.\\" A review in Variety declared: \\"Under Norman Taurog's know-how comedy direction even some of the silliness in the Phillip Shuken script gets by as entertainment, but the story lacks the legitimacy of the better Presley starrers. However, with Presley in there swinging in his usual style and his own particular brand of lightness the feature stacks up as an okay entry.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, writing: \\"'Speedway' is pleasant, kind, polite, sweet and noble, and if the late show viewers of 1988 will not discover from it what American society was like in the summer of 1968, at least they will discover what it was not like.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"has a script that ran out of gas before Elvis Presley was born. Presley pictures can be unpretentious fun, but this one is both uninspired and too much of an imitation of too many of his previous movies ... There aren't even very many songs to break up developments too predictable to outline here.\\" He thought Nancy Sinatra's one song was \\"the high point of the picture.\\"Thomas, Kevin (August 8, 1968). \\"Elvis Presley Featured in 'Speedway' Citywide\\".

Later versions include a UK top ten hit in 1964 by Scottish singer Lulu. The Isley Brothers In performances around 1958, the Isley Brothers would typically end their shows with a cover version of Jackie Wilson's hit \\"Lonely Teardrops\\". At one performance at the Uptown Theater in Philadelphia, lead singer Ronald Isley could see the audience standing and yelling their approval, so he extended the song by improvising a call-and-response around the words \\"You know you make me wanna...\\" \\"Shout!\\". The group developed the song further in later performances and rehearsals, using a drawn out \\"We-eee-ll\\" copied from Ray Charles' \\"I Got a Woman\\". On returning to New York City at the end of their engagement, they suggested to record producers Hugo & Luigi that they record the \\"Shout!\\" climax of the performance as a separate song. The producers agreed and suggested that the band invite friends to the recording studio to generate a party atmosphere. The recording took place on July 29, 1959, with Hugo and Luigi choosing the studio musicians and the Isley Brothers inviting organist Herman Stephens. Released in August 1959, with the song split over both sides of the record, the single reached number 47 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the group's first chart hit, and later the brothers' first gold single on the basis of its longevity. Ronald Isley later said that church groups wrote to radio stations asking them to stop playing the record, because of its use of a traditional black gospel sound. Other recordings One month after the initial release, Johnny O'Keefe performed the song on his Australian TV show Six O'Clock Rock. He released it as a single, which reached number two in Australiahis 1964 re- recording was only a minor hit at number 49. Joey Dee and the Starliters reached number six with their recording of the song in 1962 (they also reworked the chorus portion of the song into an even bigger hit, \\"Peppermint Twist\\"), while the Isley Brothers' version re-charted that same year at number 94.

It is also associated with instrumentalism, the belief that truth should be evaluated based upon its demonstrated usefulness. Experimentalism is considered a theory of knowledge that emphasizes direct action and scientific control as well as methods and consequences.  Conceptualizations  Experimentalism is referred to as John Dewey's version of pragmatism. The theory, which he also called as practicalism, holds that the pattern for knowledge should be modern science and modern scientific methods. Dewey explained that philosophy involves the critical evaluation of belief and that the concept's function is practical. This perspective has influenced modern American intellectual culture leading to a correction of approaches to science that had excessive concentrations on theory. While experimentalism is empirical in approach, experimentalism is distinguished from it. The latter involves the passive view of sense data and observational reports while the latter focuses on conditions where hypotheses are tested. Experimentalists maintain that political and moral concepts arise because of conflict, hence consider experience and history as essential. Deborah Mayo suggests that we should focus on how experimental knowledge is actually arrived at and how it functions in science. Mayo also suggests that the reason New Experimentalists have come up short, is that the part of experiments that have the most to offer in building an account of inference and evidence that are left untapped: designing, generating, modelling and analysing experiments and data.  Applications  Less formally, artists often pursue their visions through trial and error; this form of experimentalism has been practiced in every field, from music to film and from literature to theatre. A more specific explanation cites that this experimentalism is inductive in nature, with artists (e.g. Michaelangelo and Titian) proceeding by trial and error as opposed to the conceptualists' approach, which favors making preparatory work while step changes are made in their progress. In literature, the experimental approach may involve the production of texts through a combination of new procedures of literary production such as the inclusion of images in poetry. This is also seen in the works of computer artists or those who integrate technology in their art. For instance, Stan VanderBeek produced Poemfield through programming using BEFLIX to animate the poem's words and embed a geometric background. The fields of education and global security use the framework of experimentalism. In the case of the former, there is the position that learners continuously need new methods and experimentalism is essential in the development process. Global security specialists employ experimentalism to develop and maintain multi-faceted projects as well as determine innovative tools of governance. Such projects are operationalized through a trial-and- error and adaptive manner.

Counter-insurgency involves action from both military and police authorities. U.S. Marines and ANA soldiers on patrol during counter-insurgency operations in Marjah, Afghanistan, February 2010 A counter-insurgency or counterinsurgencySee American and British English spelling differences#Compounds and hyphens (COIN) is defined by the United States Department of State as \\"comprehensive civilian and military efforts taken to simultaneously defeat and contain insurgency and address its root causes\\". An insurgency is a rebellion against a constituted authority when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents.\\"insurgent B. n. One who rises in revolt against constituted authority; a rebel who is not recognized as a belligerent.\\" Oxford English Dictionary, second edition (1989) It is \\"the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify or challenge political control of a region. As such, it is primarily a political struggle, in which both sides use armed force to create space for their political, economic, and influence activities to be effective.\\" Counter-insurgency campaigns of duly-elected or politically recognized governments take place during war, occupation by a foreign military or police force, and when internal conflicts that involve subversion and armed rebellion occur. The most effective counterinsurgency campaigns \\"integrate and synchronize political, security, economic, and informational components that reinforce governmental legitimacy and effectiveness while reducing insurgent influence over the population. COIN strategies should be designed to simultaneously protect the population from insurgent violence; strengthen the legitimacy and capacity of government institutions to govern responsibly and marginalize insurgents politically, socially, and economically.\\"  Objectives  According to scholars, it is crucial to know what this strategy was designed to understand it comprehensively. COIN strategy aims to achieve the support of the local population for the government created by the host nation. The main point of the modern counterinsurgency campaign is not simply killing and capture insurgents, but to improve living conditions, support government in providing services for people and eliminate any support for insurgency. Models Counter-insurgency is normally conducted as a combination of conventional military operations and other means, such as demoralization in the form of propaganda, psy-ops, and assassinations. Counter-insurgency operations include many different facets: military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological, and civic actions taken to defeat insurgency. To understand counter-insurgency, one must understand insurgency to comprehend the dynamics of revolutionary warfare. Insurgents capitalize on societal problems, often called gaps; counter-insurgency addresses closing the gaps. When the gaps are wide, they create a sea of discontent, creating the environment in which the insurgent can operate. In The Insurgent Archipelago, John Mackinlay puts forward the concept of an evolution of the insurgency from the Maoist paradigm of the golden age of insurgency to the global insurgency of the start of the 21st century. He defines this distinction as 'Maoist' and 'post-Maoist' insurgency.John Mackinlay, The Insurgent Archipelago, (London: Hurst, 2009). Counter-insurgency theorists =Santa Cruz de Marcenado= The third Marques of Santa Cruz de Marcenado (1684–1732) is probably the earliest author who dealt systematically in his writings with counter- insurgency. In his Reflexiones Militares, published between 1726 and 1730, he discussed how to spot early signs of an incipient insurgency, prevent insurgencies, and counter them, if they could not be warded off. Strikingly, Santa Cruz recognized that insurgencies are usually due to real grievances: \\"A state rarely rises up without the fault of its governors.\\" Consequently, he advocated clemency towards the population and good governance, to seek the people's \\"heart and love\\".Excerpts from Santa Cruz's writings, translated into English, in Beatrice Heuser: The Strategy Makers: Thoughts on War and Society from Machiavelli to Clausewitz (Santa Monica, CA: Greenwood/Praeger, 2010), , pp. 124-146. =B. H. Liddell Hart= The majority of counter-insurgency efforts by major powers in the last century have been spectacularly unsuccessful. This may be attributed to a number of causes. First, as B. H. Liddell Hart pointed out in the Insurgency addendum to the second version of his book Strategy: The Indirect Approach, a popular insurgency has an inherent advantage over any occupying force. He showed as a prime example the French occupation of Spain during the Napoleonic wars. Whenever Spanish forces managed to constitute themselves into a regular fighting force, the superior French forces beat them every time. However, once dispersed and decentralized, the irregular nature of the rebel campaigns proved a decisive counter to French superiority on the battlefield. Napoleon's army had no means of effectively combatting the rebels, and in the end, their strength and morale were so sapped that when Wellington was finally able to challenge French forces in the field, the French had almost no choice but to abandon the situation. Counter-insurgency efforts may be successful, especially when the insurgents are unpopular. The Philippine–American War, the Shining Path in Peru, and the Malayan Emergency in Malaya have been the sites of failed insurgencies. Hart also points to the experiences of T. E. Lawrence and the Arab Revolt during World War I as another example of the power of the rebel/insurgent. Though the Ottomans often had advantages in manpower of more than 100 to 1, the Arabs' ability to materialize out of the desert, strike, and disappear again often left the Turks reeling and paralyzed, creating an opportunity for regular British forces to sweep in and finish the Turkish forces off. In both the preceding cases, the insurgents and rebel fighters were working in conjunction with or in a manner complementary to regular forces. Such was also the case with the French Resistance during World War II and the National Liberation Front during the Vietnam War. The strategy in these cases is for the irregular combatant to weaken and destabilize the enemy to such a degree that victory is easy or assured for the regular forces. However, in many modern rebellions, one does not see rebel fighters working in conjunction with regular forces. Rather, they are home-grown militias or imported fighters who have no unified goals or objectives save to expel the occupier. According to Liddell Hart, there are few effective counter-measures to this strategy. So long as the insurgency maintains popular support, it will retain all of its strategic advantages of mobility, invisibility, and legitimacy in its own eyes and the eyes of the people. So long as this is the situation, an insurgency essentially cannot be defeated by regular forces. =David Galula= David Galula gained his practical experience in counter- insurgency as a French officer in the Algerian War. His theory of counterinsurgency is not primarily military, but a combination of military, political and social actions under the strong control of a single authority. Galula proposes four \\"laws\\" for counterinsurgency: # The aim of the war is to gain the support of the population rather than control of territory. # Most of the population will be neutral in the conflict; support of the masses can be obtained with the help of an active friendly minority. # Support of the population may be lost. The population must be efficiently protected to allow it to cooperate without fear of retribution by the opposite party. # Order enforcement should be done progressively by removing or driving away armed opponents, then gaining the support of the population, and eventually strengthening positions by building infrastructure and setting long-term relationships with the population. This must be done area by area, using a pacified territory as a basis of operation to conquer a neighboring area. Galula contends that: With his four principles in mind, Galula goes on to describe a general military and political strategy to put them into operation in an area that is under full insurgent control: According to Galula, some of these steps can be skipped in areas that are only partially under insurgent control, and most of them are unnecessary in areas already controlled by the government. Thus the essence of counterinsurgency warfare is summed up by Galula as \\"Build (or rebuild) a political machine from the population upward.\\"Galula p.95 =Robert Thompson= Robert Grainger Ker Thompson wrote Defeating Communist Insurgency in 1966, arguing that a successful counter- insurgency effort must be proactive in seizing the initiative from insurgents. Thompson outlines five basic principles for a successful counter-insurgency: # The government must have a clear political aim: to establish and maintain a free, independent and united country which is politically and economically stable and viable; # The government must function in accordance with the law; # The government must have an overall plan; # The government must give priority to defeating political subversion, not the guerrilla fighters; # In the guerrilla phase of an insurgency, a government must secure its base areas first. =David Kilcullen= Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency In \\"The Three Pillars of Counterinsurgency\\", Dr. David Kilcullen, the Chief Strategist of the Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism of the U.S. State Department in 2006, described a framework for interagency cooperation in counterinsurgency operations. His pillars – Security, Political and Economic – support the overarching goal of Control, but are based on Information: Kilcullen considers the three pillars to be of equal importance, because The overall goal, according to this model, \\"is not to reduce violence to zero or to kill every insurgent, but rather to return the overall system to normality — noting that 'normality' in one society may look different from normality in another. In each case, we seek not only to establish control, but also to consolidate that control and then transfer it to permanent, effective, and legitimate institutions.\\" =Martin van Creveld= Military historian Martin van Creveld, noting that almost all attempts to deal with insurgency have ended in failure, advises: In examining why so many counterinsurgencies by powerful militaries fail against weaker enemies, Van Creveld identifies a key dynamic that he illustrates by the metaphor of killing a child. Regardless of whether the child started the fight or how well armed the child is, an adult in a fight with a child will feel that he is acting unjustly if he harms the child and foolish if the child harms him; he will, therefore, wonder if the fight is necessary. Van Creveld argues that \\"by definition, a strong counterinsurgent who uses his strength to kill the members of a small, weak organization of insurgents – let alone the civilian population by which it is surrounded, and which may lend it support – will commit crimes in an unjust cause,\\" while \\"a child who is in a serious fight with an adult is justified in using every and any means available – not because he or she is right, but because he or she has no choice.\\"van Creveld, p. 226 Every act of insurgency becomes, from the perspective of the counterinsurgent, a reason to end the conflict, while also being a reason for the insurgents to continue until victory. Trường Chinh, second in command to Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam, wrote in his Primer for Revolt: Van Creveld thus identifies \\"time\\" as the key factor in counterinsurgency. In an attempt to find lessons from the few cases of successful counterinsurgency, of which he lists two clear cases: the British efforts during The Troubles of Northern Ireland and the 1982 Hama massacre carried out by the Syrian government to suppress the Muslim Brotherhood, he asserts that the \\"core of the difficulty is neither military nor political, but moral\\" and outlines two distinct methods.van Creveld, p. 269 The first method relies on superb intelligence, provided by those who know the natural and artificial environment of the conflict as well as the insurgents. Once such superior intelligence is gained, the counterinsurgents must be trained to a point of high professionalism and discipline such that they will exercise discrimination and restraint. Through such discrimination and restraint, the counterinsurgents do not alienate members of the populace besides those already fighting them, while delaying the time when the counterinsurgents become disgusted by their own actions and demoralized. General Patrick Walters, British commander of troops in Northern Ireland, explicitly stated that his objective was not to kill as many terrorists as possible, but to ensure that as few people on both sides were killed. In the vast majority of counterinsurgencies, the \\"forces of order\\" kill far more people than they lose. In contrast and using very rough figures, the struggle in Northern Ireland had cost the United Kingdom three thousand casualties in dead alone. Of the three thousand, about seventeen hundred were civilians...of the remaining, a thousand were British soldiers. No more than three hundred were terrorists, a ratio of three to one.van Creveld, p. 235 If the prerequisites for the first method – excellent intelligence, superbly trained and disciplined soldiers and police, and an iron will to avoid being provoked into lashing out – are lacking, van Creveld posits that counterinsurgents who still want to win must use the second method exemplified by the Hama massacre. In 1982, the regime of Syrian president Hafez al-Assad was on the point of being overwhelmed by the countrywide insurgency of the Muslim Brotherhood. al-Assad sent a division under his brother Rifaat to the city of Hama, known to be the center of the resistance. Following a counterattack by the Brotherhood, Rifaat used his heavy artillery to demolish the city, killing between ten and 25 thousand people, including many women and children. Asked by reporters what had happened, Hafez al-Assad exaggerated the damage and deaths, promoted the commanders who carried out the attacks, and razed Hama's well-known great mosque, replacing it with a parking lot. With the Muslim Brotherhood scattered, the population was so cowed that it would be years before opposition groups dared to disobey the regime again and, van Creveld argues, the massacre most likely saved the regime and prevented a bloody civil war. Van Creveld condenses al-Assad's strategy into five rules while noting that they could easily have been written by Niccolò Machiavelli: # There are situations in which cruelty is necessary, and refusing to apply necessary cruelty is a betrayal of the people who put you into power. When pressed to cruelty, never threaten your opponent but disguise your intention and feign weakness until you strike. # Once you decide to strike, it is better to kill too many than not enough. If another strike is needed, it reduces the impact of the first strike. Repeated strikes will also endanger the morale of the counterinsurgent troops; soldiers forced to commit repeated atrocities will likely begin to resort to alcohol or drugs to force themselves to carry out orders and will inevitably lose their military edge, eventually turning into a danger to their commanders. # Act as soon as possible. More lives will be saved by decisive action early, than by prolonging the insurgency. The longer you wait, the more inured the population will be to bloodshed, and the more barbaric your action will have to be to make an impression. # Strike openly. Do not apologize, make excuses about \\"collateral damage\\", express regret, or promise investigations. Afterwards, make sure that as many people as possible know of your strike; media is useful for this purpose, but be careful not to let them interview survivors and arouse sympathy. # Do not command the strike yourself, in case it doesn't work for some reason and you need to disown your commander and try another strategy. If it does work, present your commander to the world, explain what you have done and make certain that everyone understands that you are ready to strike again.van Creveld, pp. 241–245 =Lorenzo Zambernardi= In \\"Counterinsurgency’s Impossible Trilemma\\", Dr. Lorenzo Zambernardi, an Italian academic now working in the United States, clarifies the tradeoffs involved in counterinsurgency operations.Zambernardi, Lorenzo, \\"Counterinsurgency's Impossible Trilemma\\", The Washington Quarterly, 33:3, July 2010, pp. 21-34 He argues that counterinsurgency involves three main goals, but in real practice a counterinsurgent needs to choose two goals out of three. Relying on economic theory, this is what Zambernardi labels the \\"impossible trilemma\\" of counterinsurgency. Specifically, the impossible trilemma suggests that it is impossible to simultaneously achieve: 1) force protection, 2) distinction between enemy combatants and noncombatants, and 3) the physical elimination of insurgents. According to Zambernardi, in pursuing any two of these three goals, a state must forgo some portion of the third objective. In particular, a state can protect its armed forces while destroying insurgents, but only by indiscriminately killing civilians as the Ottomans, Italians, and Nazis did in the Balkans, Libya, and Eastern Europe. It can choose to protect civilians along with its own armed forces instead, avoiding so-called collateral damage, but only by abandoning the objective of destroying the insurgents. Finally, a state can discriminate between combatants and noncombatants while killing insurgents, but only by increasing the risks for its own troops, because often insurgents will hide behind civilians, or appear to be civilians. So a country must choose two out of three goals and develop a strategy that can successfully accomplish them, while sacrificing the third objective. Zambernardi's theory posits that to protect populations, which is necessary to defeat insurgencies, and to physically destroy an insurgency, the counterinsurgent's military forces must be sacrificed, risking the loss of domestic political support. =Akali Omeni= Another writer who explores a trio of features relevant to understanding counter-insurgency is Akali Omeni. Within the contemporary context, COIN warfare by African militaries tends to be at the margins of the theoretical debate - even though Africa today is faced with a number of deadly insurgencies. In Counter-insurgency in Nigeria, Omeni, a Nigerian academic, discusses the interactions between certain features away from the battlefield, which account for battlefield performance against insurgent warfare. Specifically, Omeni argues that the trio of historical experience, organisational culture (OC) and doctrine, help explain the institution of COIN within militaries and their tendency to reject the innovation and adaptation often necessary to defeat insurgency. These three features, furthermore, influence and can undermine the operational tactics and concepts adopted against insurgents. The COIN challenge, therefore, is not just operational; it also is cultural and institutional before ever it reflects on the battlefield. According to Omeni, institutional isomorphism is a sociological phenomenon that constrains the habits of a military (in this case, the Nigerian military) to the long-established, yet increasingly ineffective, ideology of the offensive in irregular warfare. As Omeni writes, > Whereas the Nigerian military’s performance against militias in the Niger > Delta already suggested the military had a poor grasp of the threat of > insurgent warfare; it was further along the line, as the military struggled > against Boko Haram’s threat, that the extent of this weakness was exposed. > At best, the utility of force, for the Nigerian military, had become but a > temporary solution against the threat of insurgent warfare. At worst, the > existing model has been perpetuated at such high cost, that urgent > revisionist thinking around the idea of counter-insurgency within the > military institution may now be required. Additionally, the military’s > decisive civil war victory, the pivot in Nigeria’s strategic culture towards > a regional role, and the institutional delegitimization brought about by > decades of coups and political meddling, meant that much time went by > without substantive revisionism to military’s thinking around its internal > function. Change moreover, where it occurred, was institutionally isomorphic > and not as far removed from the military’s own origins as the intervening > decades may have suggested.Omeni, Akali (2017) Counter-insurgency in > Nigeria: The Military and Operations Against Boko Haram, 2011-17. Abingdon, > Oxon: Routledge. pp. 52-53. Further, the infantry-centric nature of the Nigerian Army's battalions, traceable all the way back to the Civil War in Nigeria back in the 1960s, is reflected in the kinetic nature of the Army's contemporary COIN approach.Omeni, Akali (2018) Insurgency and War in Nigeria: Regional Fracture and the Fight Against Boko Haram (forthcoming) I.B. Tauris. This approach has failed to defeat Boko Haram in the way many expected. Certainly, therefore, the popular argument today, which holds that the Nigerian Army has struggled in COIN due to capabilities shortcomings, holds some merit. However, a full- spectrum analysis of the Nigeria case suggests that this popular dominant narrative scarcely scratches the surface of the true COIN challenge. This population-centered challenge, moreover, is one that militaries across the world continue to contend with. And in attempting to solve the COIN puzzle, state forces over the decades have tried a range of tactics.Omeni, Akali (2017) Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations against Boko Haram, 2011-17. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge =Information-centric theory= Starting in the early 2000s, micro-level data has transformed the analysis of effective counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. Leading this work is the \\"information-centric\\" group of theorists and researchers, led by the work of the Empirical Studies of Conflict (ESOC) group at Princeton University, and the Conflict and Peace, Research and Development (CPRD) group at the University of Michigan. Berman, Shapiro, and Felter have outlined the modern information-centric model. In this framework, the critical determinant of counterinsurgent success is information about insurgents provided to counterinsurgents, such as insurgent locations, plans, and targets. Information can be acquired from civilian sources (human intelligence, HUMINT), or through signals intelligence (SIGINT). Tactics =Population control= A strategic hamlet in South Vietnam c.1964 With regard to tactics, the terms \\"drain the water\\" or \\"drain the swamp\\" involves the forced relocation of the population (\\"water\\") to expose the rebels or insurgents (\\"fish\\"). In other words, relocation deprives the aforementioned of the support, cover, and resources of the local population. One of the earliest examples of the strategy was applied by the British Empire during the Second Boer War; to segregate potential Boer supporters from Boer Commandos, scorched earth tactics were used to destroy Boer farmland while Boers were shipped abroad or confined to concentration camps converted from refugee camps for displaced Boers. The tactic was later refined in the Briggs Plan during the Malayan Emergency, when predominantly Chinese rural population centers with suspected Malayan Races Liberation Army sympathizers were gutted and their populations transferred to enclosed and guarded \\"New Villages\\" to control and monitor population activity; to improve local support for the British, New Villages were equipped with adequate basic amenities, including running water, electricity, and health and education services. A somewhat similar strategy was used extensively by US forces in South Vietnam until 1969, initially by forcing the rural population into fenced, secured villages, referred to as Strategic Hamlets, and later by declaring the areas people in the Strategic Hamlets had come from as free-fire zones to remove the remainder of the population from their villages and farms. Widespread use was made of Agent Orange (which was first used on a large scale by the British during the Malayan Emergency), sprayed from airplanes, to destroy crops that might have provided resources for Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops and their human support base. These measures proved ineffective, since Phạm Ngọc Thảo, who oversaw the program, was a communist agent and sabotaged the implementation of the hamlets. This allowed Viet Cong activists and sympathizers to infiltrate the new communities.Karnow, p. 274 In any event, the Vietnam War was only partly a counter-insurgency campaign, as it also involved conventional combat between US/ARVN forces, Vietcong Main Force Battalions, and the North Vietnamese Army (NVA). According to a report of the Naval Postgraduate School: =Oil spot= The oil spot approach is the concentration of counter-insurgent forces into an expanding, secured zone. The origins of the expression is to be found in its initial use by Marshal Hubert Lyautey, the main theoretician of French colonial warfare and counter-insurgency strategy.Lyautey, Hubert. Du rôle colonial de l'armée (Paris: Armand Colin, 1900)Porch, Douglas. \\"Bugeaud, Galliéni, Lyautey: The Development of French colonial warfare\\", in Paret, Peter; Craig, Gordon Alexande; Gilbert, Felix (eds). Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1986), pp. 376-407. The oil spot approach was later one of the justifications given in the Pentagon Papers for the Strategic Hamlet Program. =Cordon and search= Cordon and search is a military tactic, one of the basic counter-insurgency operations in which an area is cordoned off and premises are searched for weapons or insurgents. Other related operations are \\"Cordon and knock\\"Chronology: How the Mosul raid unfolded. Retrieved 28.07.2005.Used in \\"Operation Quick Strike\\" in Iraq on August 6, 2005. Retrieved 11 January 2007. and \\"Cordon and kick\\". \\"Cordon and search\\" is part of new doctrine called Stability and Support Operations or SASO. It is a technique used where there is no hard intelligence of weapons in the house and therefore is less intense than a normal house search. It is used in urban neighborhoods. The purpose of the mission is to search a house with as little inconvenience to the resident family as possible. =Air operations= Air power can play an important role in counter-insurgency, capable of carrying out a wide range of operations: * Transportation in support of combatants and civilians alike, including casualty evacuations; * Intelligence gathering, surveillance, and reconnaissance; * Psychological operations, through leaflet drops, loudspeakers, and radio broadcasts; * Air-to-ground attack against 'soft' targets. 7th SFG Special Forces medic gives a young boy a coloring book during a meeting with village religious leaders to gain their support and obtain information, Afghanistan 2008 =Public diplomacy= In General David Petraeus’ Counterinsurgency Field Manual, one of the many tactics described to help win in counterinsurgency warfare involves the use of public diplomacy through military means. Counterinsurgency is effective when it is integrated \\"into a comprehensive strategy employing all instruments of national power,\\" including public diplomacy. The goal of COIN operations is to render the insurgents as ineffective and non-influential, by having strong and secure relations with the population of the host nation. An understanding of the host nation and the environment that the COIN operations will take place in is essential. Public diplomacy in COIN warfare is only effective when there is a clear understanding of the culture and population at hand. One of the largest factors needed for defeating an insurgency involves understanding the populace, how they interact with the insurgents, how they interact with non- government organizations in the area, and how they view the counterinsurgency operations themselves. Ethics is a common public diplomacy aspect that is emphasized in COIN warfare. Insurgents win their war by attacking internal will and the international opposition. In order to combat these tactics the counterinsurgency operations need to treat their prisoners and detainees humanely and according to American values and principles. By doing this, COIN operations show the host nation's population that they can be trusted and that they are concerned about the well being of the population in order to be successful in warfare. Operation Moshtarak; A U.S. Marine hands out candy to children while conducting counterinsurgency operations in Marjah, Afghanistan 2010 A population that expects the incumbent government to deliver public goods, services, and security frequently supports the counterinsurgency, and a major event that increases popular expectations of future public goods and service delivery can trigger a shift in public attitudes away from the insurgency and toward the counterinsurgency. \\"Political, social, and economic programs are usually more valuable than conventional military operations in addressing the root causes of the conflict and undermining the insurgency.\\" These programs are essential in order to gain the support of the population. These programs are designed to make the local population feel secure, safe, and more aligned with the counterinsurgency efforts; this enables the citizens of the host nation to trust the goals and purposes of the counterinsurgency efforts, as opposed to the insurgents’. A counterinsurgency is a battle of ideas and the implementation and integration of these programs is important for success. Social, political and economic programs should be coordinated and administered by the host nation's leaders, as well. Successful COIN warfare allows the population to see that the counterinsurgency efforts are including the host nation in their re-building programs. The war is fought among the people and for the people between the insurgents and the counterinsurgents. A counterinsurgency is won by utilizing strategic communications and information operations successfully. A counterinsurgency is a competition of ideas, ideologies, and socio-political movements. In order to combat insurgent ideologies one must understand the values and characteristics of the ideology or religion. Additionally, counterinsurgency efforts need to understand the culture of which the insurgency resides, in order to strategically launch information and communication operations against the insurgent ideology or religion. Counterinsurgency information operatives need to also identify key audiences, communicators, and public leaders to know whom to influence and reach out to with their information. = Information operations = Public diplomacy in information operations can only be achieved by a complete understanding of the culture it is operating in. Counterinsurgency operations must be able to perceive the world from the locals’ perspective. To develop a comprehensive cultural picture counterinsurgency efforts should invest in employing \\"media consultants, finance and business experts, psychologists, organizational network analysts, and scholars from a wide range of disciplines.\\" Most importantly, counterinsurgency efforts need to be able to understand why the local population is drawn into the insurgent ideology, like what aspects are appealing and how insurgents use information to draw their followers into the ideology. Counterinsurgency communication efforts need a baseline understanding of values, attitudes, and perceptions of the people in the area of operations to conduct successful public diplomacy to defeat the enemy. Developing information and communication strategies involve providing a legitimate alternate ideology, improving security and economic opportunity, and strengthening family ties outside of the insurgency. In order to conduct public diplomacy through these means, counterinsurgency communication needs to match its deeds with its words. Information provided through public diplomacy during a counterinsurgency cannot lie, the information and communication to the people always has to be truthful and trustworthy in order to be effective at countering the insurgents. Public diplomacy in counterinsurgency to influence the public thoughts and ideas is a long time engagement and should not be done through negative campaigning about the enemy. Conducting public diplomacy through relaying information and communicating with the public in a counterinsurgency is most successful when a conversation can happen between the counterinsurgency team and the local population of the area of operation. Building rapport with the public involves \\"listening, paying attention, and being responsive and proactive\\" which is sufficient for the local population to understand and trust the counterinsurgency efforts and vice versa. This relationship is stringent upon the counterinsurgents keeping their promises, providing security to the locals, and communicating their message directly and quickly in times of need. Understanding and influencing the cognitive dimension of the local population is essential to winning counterinsurgency warfare. The people's perception of legitimacy about the host nation and the foreign country's counterinsurgency efforts is where success is determined. \\"The free flow of information present in all theaters via television, telephone, and Internet, can present conflicting messages and quickly defeat the intended effects.\\" Coordination between the counterinsurgency operations, the host nation, and the local media in information presented to the public is essential to showing and influencing how the local population perceives the counterinsurgency efforts and the host nation. Public opinion, the media, and rumors influence how the people view counterinsurgency, the government hosting their efforts, and the host nation legitimacy. The use of public diplomacy to strategically relay the correct messages and information to the public is essential to success in a counterinsurgency operation. For example, close relationships with media members in the area is essential to ensure that the locals understand the counterinsurgency objectives and feel secure with the host nation government and the counterinsurgency efforts. If the local media is not in sync with the counterinsurgency operatives then they could spread incomplete or false information about the counterinsurgency campaign to the public. \\"Given Al Qaeda’s global reach, the United States must develop a more integrated strategic communication strategy for counter-insurgency with its allies to diminish violent rhetoric, improve its image abroad, and detect, deter, and defeat this social movement at its many levels.\\" Information operations and communicative abilities are one of the largest and most influence aspects of public diplomacy within a counterinsurgency. Public diplomacy is especially important as modern insurgents are more easily able to gain support through a variety of sources, both local and transnational, thanks to advances in increased communication and globalization. Consequently, modern counter-insurgency requires attention to be focused on an insurgency's ecosystem from the national to the local level, in order to deprive the insurgency of support and prevent future insurgent groups from forming. Specific doctrines =Vietnam War= During the Vietnam War, counter- insurgency initially formed part of the earlier war as Diem had implemented the poorly conceived Strategic Hamlet Program, a similar model to the Malayan Emergency, which had opposite effects. Similarly economic and rural development formed a key strategy as part of Rural Affairs development. While the earlier war was marked by considerable emphasis on counter-insurgency programs US forces initially relied on very little if any theoretical doctrine of counter-insurgency during the Ground-Intervention phase. Conventional warfare using massive fire-power and failure to implement adequate counter- insurgency had extremely negative effects and was the strategy whom the NVA were adept at countering through the protracted political and military warfare model. These are in part, reasons for the outright failure of U.S strategic policy in the war. Following the replacement of General William Westmoreland, newer concepts were tried including a revival of earlier COIN strategies including Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support. This was alongside the brutal and oftentimes badly implemented civilian-assassination program Phoenix Program targeting Viet Cong civilian personnel. These reasons were contributing factors to the U.S failure as it had become too late by then. =British Empire= Malaya British forces were able to employ the relocation method with considerable success during the \\"Malayan Emergency\\". The Briggs Plan, implemented fully in 1950, relocated Chinese Malayans into protected \\"New Villages\\", designated by British forces. By the end of 1951, some 400,000 ethnic Chinese had moved into the fortifications. Of this population, the British forces were able to form a \\"Home Guard\\", armed for resistance against the Malayan Communist Party, an implementation mirrored by the Strategic Hamlet Program later used by US forces in South Vietnam. Despite British claims of a victory in the Malayan Emergency, military historian Martin van Creveld noted that the end result of the counterinsurgency, namely the withdrawal of British forces and establishment of an independent state, are identical to that of Aden, Kenya and Cyprus, which are not considered victories.van Creveld, p. 221 =Dutch Empire= The Dutch formulated a new strategy of counter-insurgency warfare, during the Aceh War by deploying light-armed Marechaussee units and using scorched earth tactics. In 1898 Van Heutsz was proclaimed governor of Aceh, and with his lieutenant, later Dutch Prime Minister Hendrikus Colijn, would finally conquer most of Aceh. They followed Hurgronje's suggestions, finding cooperative uleebelang or secular chiefs that would support them in the countryside and isolating the resistance from their rural support base. During the South Sulawesi Campaign Captain Raymond Westerling of the KST, Special Forces of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army used the Westerling Method. Westerling ordered the registration of all Javanese arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html Based on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the Quran and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \\"redeemable\\". Westerling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948. =France= France had major counterinsurgency wars in its colonies in Indochina and Algeria. McClintock cited the basic points of French doctrine as: * Quadrillage (an administrative grid of population and territory) * Ratissage (cordoning and \\"raking\\") * Regroupement (relocating and closely controlling a suspect population) * ‘Tache d'huile' – The 'oil spot' strategy * Recruitment of local leaders and forces * Paramilitary organization and militias Much of the thinking was informed by the work of earlier leading French theoreticians of colonial warfare and counter-insurgency, Marshals Bugeaud, Gallieni and Lyautey. While McClintock cites the 1894 Algerian governor, Jules Cambon, as saying \\"By destroying the administration and local government we were also suppressing our means of action. ...The result is that we are today confronted by a sort of human dust on which we have no influence and in which movements take place which are unknown to us.\\" Cambon's philosophy, however, did not seem to survive into the Algerian War of Independence, (1954–1962). The sophisticated NLF/PAVN insurgent structure was embedded in the population and difficult to root out and combat. French and US Special Forces (Green Berets) saw some success in organizing tribal peoples to fight.Pike, Douglas. PAVN: People's Army of Vietnam. (Presidio: 1996) pp. 37-169 Indochina Post-WWII doctrine, as in Indochina, took a more drastic view of \\"Guerre révolutionnaire\\", which presented an ideological and global war, with a commitment to total war. Countermeasures, in principle, needed to be both political and military; \\"No measure was too drastic to meet the new threat of revolution.\\" French forces taking control from the Japanese did not seem to negotiate seriously with nationalist elements in what was to become Vietnam, and reaped the consequences of overconfidence at Điện Biên Phủ. It occurred to various commanders that soldiers trained to operate as guerrillas would have a strong sense of how to fight guerrillas. Before the partition of French Indochina, French Groupement de commandos mixtes aéroportés (GCMA), led by Roger Trinquier, took on this role, drawing on French experience with the Jedburgh teams. GCMA, operating in Tonkin and Laos under French intelligence, was complemented by Commandos Nord Viêt-Nam in the North. In these missions, the SOF teams lived and fought with the locals. One Laotian, who became an officer, was Vang Pao, who was to become a general in Hmong and Laotian operations in Southeast Asia while the US forces increased their role. Algeria The French counterinsurgency in colonial Algeria was a savage one. The 1957 Battle of Algiers resulted in 24,000 detentions, with most tortured and an estimated 3,000 killed. It may have broken the National Liberation Front infrastructure in Algiers, but it also killed off French legitimacy as far as \\"hearts and minds\\" went. Counter-insurgency requires an extremely capable intelligence infrastructure endowed with human sources and deep cultural knowledge. This contributes to the difficulty that foreign, as opposed to indigenous, powers have in counter-insurgent operations. One of France's most influential theorists was Roger Trinquier. The Modern Warfare counterinsurgency strategy described by Trinquier, who had led anti-communist guerrillas in Indochina, was a strong influence on French efforts in Algeria. Trinquier suggested three principles: # separate the guerrilla from the population that supports it; # occupy the zones that the guerrillas previously operated from, making the area dangerous for the insurgents and turning the people against the guerrilla movement; and # coordinate actions over a wide area and for a long enough time that the guerrilla is denied access to the population centers that could support him. Trinquier's view was that torture had to be extremely focused and limited, but many French officers considered its use corrosive to its own side. There were strong protests among French leaders: the Army's most decorated officer, General Jacques Pâris de Bollardière, confronted General Jacques Massu, the commander of French forces in the Battle of Algiers, over orders institutionalizing torture, as \\"an unleashing of deplorable instincts which no longer knew any limits.\\" He issued an open letter condemning the danger to the army of the loss of its moral values \\"under the fallacious pretext of immediate expediency\\", and was imprisoned for sixty days. As some of the French Army protested, other parts increased the intensity of their approach, which led to an attempted military coup against the French Fourth Republic itself. Massu and General Raoul Salan led a 1958 coup in Algiers, demanding a new Republic under Charles de Gaulle. When de Gaulle's policies toward Algeria, such as a 1961 referendum on Algerian self-determination, did not meet the expectations of the colonial officers, Salan formed the underground Organisation armée secrète (OAS), a right-wing terrorist group, whose actions included a 1962 assassination attempt against de Gaulle himself. West Africa France has had taken Barnett's Leviathan role in Chad and Ivory Coast, the latter on two occasions, most significantly in 2002–2003. The situation with France and Ivory Coast is not a classic FID situation, as France attacked Ivorian forces that had provoked UN peacekeepers. Another noteworthy instance of counter-insurgency in West Africa is the Nigerian military experience against Boko Haram militant Islamists. Military operations against the group occur predominantly in the far north-east areas of Nigeria. These operations have been ongoing since June 2011, and have greatly expanded within the Lake Chad Basin sub-region of West Africa.Omeni, Akali. 2017. Counter-insurgency in Nigeria: The Military and Operations against Boko Haram, 2011-17. Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge. =India= There have been many insurgencies in India since its independence in 1947. The Kashmir insurgency, which started by 1989, was brought under control by Indian government and violence has been reduced. A branch of the Indian Army known as the Rashtriya Rifles (RR) was created for the sole purpose of destroying the insurgency in Kashmir, and it has played a major role in doing so. The RR was well supported by Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Border Security Force (BSF), Indo- Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and state government police. The Counter Insurgency and Jungle Warfare School (CIJWS) is located in the northeastern town of Vairengte in the Indian state of Mizoram. Personnel from countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Bangladesh and Vietnam have attended this school. High quality graduate level training by a joint staff of highly trained special operators at Camp Taji Phoenix Academy and the Counterinsurgency Centre For Excellence is provided in India as well as many Indian Officers. =Portugal= Portugal's experience in counterinsurgency resulted from the \\"pacification\\" campaigns conducted in the Portuguese African and Asian colonies in the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Portugal conducted large scale counterinsurgency operations in Angola, Portuguese Guinea and Mozambique against independentist guerrillas supported by the Eastern Bloc and China, as well by some Western countries. Although these campaigns are collectively known as the \\"Portuguese Colonial War\\", there were in fact three different ones: the Angolan Independence War, the Guinea- Bissau War of Independence and the Mozambican War of Independence. The situation was unique in that small armed forces - those of Portugal - were able to conduct three counterinsurgency wars at the same time, in three different theatres of operations separated by thousands of kilometers. For these operations, Portugal developed its own counterinsurgency doctrine.Cann, Jonh P., Counterinsurgency in Africa: The Portuguese Way of War, 1961-1974, Hailer Publishing, 2005 = Russia and The Soviet Union = The most familiar Russian counterinsurgency is the War in Afghanistan from 1979–1989. However, throughout the history of Czarist Russian, the Russians fought many counterinsurgencies as new Caucasian and Central Asian territory were occupied. It was in these conflicts that the Russians developed the following counterinsurgency tactics: # Deploy a significant number of troops # Isolate the area from outside assistance # Establish tight control of major cities and towns # Build lines of forts to restrict insurgent movement # Destroy the springs of resistance through destruction of settlements, livestock, crops etc. These tactics, generally speaking, were carried over into Soviet use following the 1917 revolution for the most part, save for the integration of political-military command. This tactical blue print saw use following the First and Second World Wars in Dagestan, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Siberia, Lithuania and Ukraine. This doctrine was ultimately shown to be inadequate in The Soviet War in Afghanistan, mostly due to insufficient troop commitment, and in the Wars in Chechnya. =United States= The United States has conducted counterinsurgency campaigns during the Philippine–American War, the Vietnam War, the post-2001 War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in increased interest in counterinsurgency within the American military, exemplified by the 2006 publication of a new joint Army Field Manual 3-24/Marine Corps Warfighting Publication No. 3-33.5, Counterinsurgency, which replaced the documents separately published by the Army and Marine Corps 20–25 years prior. Views of the doctrine contained in the manual has been mixed. The 2014 version of FM 3-24/MCWP 3-33.5 acquired a new title, Insurgencies and Countering Insurgencies, it consists of three main parts, William B. Caldwell IV wrote: In the recent conflicts the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) has been increasingly involved conducting special operations especially the training and development of other states' military and security forces. This is known in the special operations community as foreign internal defense. It was announced 14 January 2016 that 1,800 soldiers from the 101st's Headquarters and its 2nd Brigade Combat Team will deploy soon on regular rotations to Baghdad and Irbil to train and advise Iraqi army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces who are expected in the coming months to move toward Mosul, the Islamic State group's de facto headquarters in Iraq.1,800 soldiers from the 101st's Headquarters and its 2nd Brigade Combat Team will deploy soon on regular rotations to Baghdad and Irbil to train and advise Iraqi army and Kurdish peshmerga forces who are expected in the coming months to move toward Mosul, the Islamic State group's de facto headquarters in Iraq. The 101st Airborne Division will serve an integral role in preparing Iraqi ground troops to expel the Islamic State group from Mosul, Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the division's soldiers during a January 2016 visit to Fort Campbell, Kentucky. Defense Secretary Ash Carter told the 101st Airborne Division that \\"The Iraqi and peshmerga forces you will train, advise and assist have proven their determination, their resiliency, and increasingly, their capability, but they need you to continue building on that success, preparing them for the fight today and the long hard fight for their future. They need your skill. They need your experience.\\" Foreign internal defense policymaking has subsequently aided in Iraqi successes in reclaiming Tikrit, Baiji, Ramadi, Fallujah, and Mosul from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Recent evaluations of U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan have yielded mixed results. A comprehensive study by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction concluded that \\"the U.S. government greatly overestimated its ability\\" to use COIN and stabilization tactics for longterm success. The report found that \\"successes in stabilizing Afghan districts rarely lasted longer than the physical presence of coalition troops and civilians.\\" These findings are corroborated by scholarly studies of U.S. counterinsurgency activities in Afghanistan, which determined that backlashes by insurgents and the local population were common. In October 2019 at a Workshop at RAND, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy rolled out the Irregular Warfare Annex (IWA) to the National Defense Strategy of 2018. He explained that irregular warfare included counter-insurgency, counter- terrorism, unconventional warfare, foreign internal defense, sabotage and subversion, as well as stabilization and information operations. It had traditionally been perceived as a predominately counterterrorism (CT) effort used to fight violent extremist organizations, but that under the IWA the skills will be applied to all areas of military competition. These included competition against global powers competitors like China and Russia as well as rogue states like North Korea and Iran. Mulroy said that the U.S. must be prepared to respond with \\"aggressive, dynamic, and unorthodox approaches to IW,\\" to be competitive across these priorities. He also explained that under the IWA, both special operations and conventional forces would play a key role.

It is on the East Coastway Line, and train services are provided by Southern. Opened on 1 January 1888, it was originally called Willingdon, but was renamed Hampden Park for Willingdon on 1 July 1903. The name became Hampden Park under British Railways. It is one of two stations serving Eastbourne, the other being Eastbourne railway station The station is located on a spur line originally termed the Eastbourne Branch.Handbook of Stations ... on the Railways of Great Britain and Ireland British Transport Commission (Railway Clearing House) 1956 There was a rarely used triangular junction between Polegate and the now-closed Stone Cross which allowed trains to bypass the Branch; the track has now been lifted. Services along the coast have almost invariably served Eastbourne, and as Eastbourne is at the end of the spur line, the trains pass through Hampden Park station twice - once on the way to Eastbourne, and once on the way out of Eastbourne - although not all trains stop on both occasions. Because of this arrangement, some connections are advertised to allow passengers on the Victoria-Eastbourne service to use Hampden Park to pick up the stopping service to Hastings and vice versa. The level crossing at Hampden Park is thought to be one of the busiest in the country, with an average of sixteen train movements an hour off-peak, and this can lead to significant traffic congestion on adjacent roads. The signal box which controlled the crossing was abolished in February 2015 when the controls were transferred to Three Bridges Regional Operations Centre.  Services  The typical Mondays-Fridays off-peak service is: *2tph to London Victoria (of which one stops here before Eastbourne and one stops after Eastbourne); *1tph to Brighton (stopping both before and after Eastbourne); *1tph to Hastings (stopping before Eastbourne); *2tph to Ore (stopping after Eastbourne); *1tph to Ashford International (stopping after Eastbourne); *2tph to Eastbourne only.

On 5 September 2018, Weber declared his intention to run for the position of President of the European Commission and was elected as the Spitzenkandidat of the EPP on 8 November.

From 2002 until 2004, he served as Member of the Landtag of Bavaria. In 2003, Weber succeeded Markus Söder as chairman of the Junge Union in Bavaria; he served in that position until 2007. In this capacity, he also joined the CSU executive board. In 2008, he succeeded Erwin Huber as chairman of the CSU of Lower Bavaria, one of the party's ten districts. =Member of the European Parliament, 2004–present= Weber served on the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs from 2004 until 2012 and on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs from 2012 until 2014. During that time, he was a substitute for the Committee on Regional Development, a member of the Delegation for relations with India, a substitute for the Delegation for relations with the countries of the Andean Community and a substitute on the Subcommittee on Human Rights. As rapporteur, he negotiated in 2008 for the European Parliament Directive on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (Return Directive), the first Directive in the field of home affairs to be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedure.Speakers at Harvard Kennedy School 2015 European Conference at Harvard, February 27–28, 2015. After his reelection in 2009 Weber became Vice-Chairman of the European People's Party group in the European Parliament under the leadership of chairman Joseph Daul. In that capacity, he was responsible for setting the political strategy and the policy in the area of Justice and Home affairs. Weber has been chairing the EPP group since 2014. He has since been a member of the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, first under the leadership of Martin Schulz (2014-2017) and later Antonio Tajani (since 2017). Between 2014 and 2016, Weber was a member of the now defunct G5 group along with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, Vice President Frans Timmermans, Socialist group leader Gianni Pittella and Martin Schulz, then President of the European Parliament.Maïa de La Baume (February 14, 2017), Germany’s Weber wants a ‘G6’ to push out the populists Politico Europe. In early 2017, Weber established the so-called G6, a group of parliamentary leaders including Pittella as well as Guy Verhofstadt of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), Syed Kamall of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Ska Keller of the Greens, and Gabriele Zimmer of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left. Bid to become President of European Commission In September 2018, Weber announced his candidacy (Spitzenkandidat) for the post of the President of the European Commission for the 2019 European election. (Under the unofficial Spitzenkandidat system, the leader of the European party that commands the largest coalition in the European Parliament subsequent to an election to the European Parliament is likely to become the European Commission president.https://www.euronews.com/2019/05/27/who-s- winning-the-race-to-be-the-next-european-commission-president) Weber's European People's Party won the relative majority of seats in the European Parliament in May 2019, thus making him the lead candidate to succeed Jean- Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission unless the Spitzenkandidat system was abandoned. On May 28, leaders of EU governments tasked European Council President Donald Tusk with leading the negotiations with members of the European Parliament and national leaders to pick a new European Commission President at an EU summit in late June 2019. Tusk hinted that Weber was the \\"lead candidate.\\" This did not materialise with Ursula von der Leyen, a fellow member of the European People's Party, being appointed President. =Role in national politics= In 2015, Bavaria's Minister President Horst Seehofer nominated Weber as one of his deputies in the office of CSU chairman, making him part of the party's leadership. In the negotiations to form a coalition government under the leadership of Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, he was part of the working group on European policy, led by Peter Altmaier, Alexander Dobrindt and Achim Post. Merkel and her government also have backed Weber's bid to become President of the European Commission.https://www.ft.com/content/a93e2416-8063-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849 Political positions =European integration= On 7 June 2014, Weber dismissed demands by British Prime Minister David Cameron to put the brakes on European integration. Weber stated that \\"The EU is based on an ever closer union of European peoples. That is set out in the treaties. It is not negotiable for us... We cannot sell the soul of Europe... if we grant every national parliament a veto right, Europe would come to a standstill.\\" However, he supports Cameron's demand that Britain, as a non-euro country, should be empowered to influence eurozone policy decisions. Also, he told The Guardian in early 2015 that the United Kingdom's drive to freeze welfare payments for EU immigrants was justified and set an example for the rest of the union.Ian Traynor (5 January 2016), EU reform: senior German politicians move to support David Cameron The Guardian. In early 2017, Weber held that if the International Monetary Fund (IMF) insisted on debt relief for Greece, it should no longer participate in the bailout, thereby breaking ranks with his political party's official line that the program would end if the IMF pulled out.Michelle Martin (26 February 2017), No debt relief for Greece, Germany's deputy finance minister says Reuters. Commenting on the UK's vote to leave the European Union, Weber said, “The British people decided to leave this union, so they will not be so comfortable, so safe, not so economically strong. That’s why we will say that it really is a very negative day.”Angela Merkel rejects one of Theresa May's key Brexit demands The Guardian As chairman of the European People's Party, the biggest party within the EU Parliament, Weber placed a petition to grant free Interrail tickets to all EU citizens on their 18th birthday. These tickets would allow free travel within all of the EU for one month. Motivating reasons mentioned by Weber: \\"It is about bringing people together. We must arrange for young people to be thrilled by Europe again.\\" However, the idea would have cost the EU taxpayer subsidies of 2.3 billion euros every year, hence the proposal did not find much support. =Conflicts over Hungary= In July 2013, when the European Parliament Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) issued the Tavares Report criticizing the erosion of fundamental rights in Hungary, Weber dismissed it as a politically motivated attack on the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán by leftist parties.R. Daniel Kelemen (June 18, 2015), EPP loves Orbán Politico Europe. However, in September 2018 he approved the Sargentini Report voting to trigger Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union procedure against the government of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. Nevertheless, as head of the group, he failed in preventing a split in the European People's Party group: 115 of its deputies voted in favour of the move, while 57 voted against, with 28 abstentions and 20 stayed away from voting. In the run-up of the 2019 European Parliament election, Weber could not stop Orbán from his poster campaign targeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Juncker: Hungary's ruling Fidesz doesn't belong in EPP Retrieved 5 March 2019. and billionaire George Soros.Orbán's campaign against George Soros Retrieved 5 March 2019. Eventually, on 20 March 2019, the EPP suspended the membership of Orban's party Fidesz.Fidesz membership in EPP suspended but remains in the EPP-group Retrieved 27 March 2019. =Relations with Russia= In a 2016 letter to Sigmar Gabriel, German economy minister, and Miguel Arias Cañete, EU energy commissioner, Weber criticized the proposed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, in that it would undermine the EU's foreign and security goals by increasing dependence on Gazprom, Russia's gas export monopoly. Rather than new supplies across the Baltic, Weber called upon the Commission to accelerate its efforts to import more gas across Turkey from the Caspian Sea, and even potentially Iran and Iraq.Christian Oliver (May 1, 2016), Top German MEP joins foes of controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline Financial Times. = Gay conversion therapies = In March 2018, Weber voted against initiatives prohibiting gay conversion therapies, unlike the majority of the European People Party's MEPs. This vote raised the question on whether he is in favour of such practices.

The station was on the Unknown River, a tributary of the Churchill River that drains the central Labrador basin. Construction began in 1960. The river was dammed at Twin Falls to form the Ossokmanuan Reservoir. When finished in 1963, the station had a total capacity of 225 MW with two long transmission lines at 230,000 volts (or 230 kV). It cost $47.5 million (1963). Twin Falls power was essential to the later development at Churchill Falls. It helped open up the area and supplied the power required during the construction phase of the project. In the planning stage, however, it became apparent that greater efficiency in the production of electricity could be achieved by diverting the flow of water from the Ossokmanuan Reservoir into the Smallwood Reservoir. Utilizing this water at the Churchill Falls plant enabled approximately three times as much electricity to be produced from the same volume of water. In July 1974 the Twin Falls plant was put into extended shutdown and the water diverted into the Smallwood Reservoir under an agreement with Churchill Falls Labrador Corporation Limited (CFLCo).

An economist by education, he was head of the (SD) Inland, responsible for intelligence and security within Germany. In 1941, Ohlendorf was appointed the commander of D, which perpetrated mass murder in Moldova, south Ukraine, the Crimea and, during 1942, the North Caucasus. He was tried at the Einsatzgruppen Trial, convicted and executed in 1951. Life and education Born in Hoheneggelsen (today part of Söhlde; then in the Kingdom of Prussia), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \\"a farming family\\". He joined the Nazi Party in 1925 (member 6631) and the SS (member #880) in 1926. Ohlendorf studied economics and law at the University of Leipzig and the University of Göttingen, and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the University of Pavia, where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Ohlendorf was active in the National Socialist Students' League in both Kiel and Göttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin. He participated in major debates between the SS, the German Labour Front, and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy. By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board (). Historian quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \\"quest for race\\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals. SS career Ohlendorf joined the SD in 1936 and became an economic consultant of the organisation. Like other talented academics such as Helmut Knochen and Franz Six, Ohlendorf had been recruited by SD talent scouts. Attached to the SS with the rank of SS-Hauptsturmführer, by 1939, he had obtained the rank of SS-Standartenführer and was appointed as head of Amt III (SD-Inland) of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA), a position he kept until 1945. His role in collecting intelligence from his secret police agents was disliked by some of the Nazi leadership. Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler once characterized Ohlendorf as \\"an unbearable Prussian\\" who was \\"without humour\\". Nonetheless, Ohlendorf was instrumental as a member of the SD in shaping Nazi economic doctrine, which became \\"increasingly virulent as the war progressed\\" as he attempted to mould the economy \\"in an ethnic context\\". It was Ohlendorf's responsibility as head of the SD-Inland to collect data and scientifically examine social, cultural, and economic issues, assembling reports to his superiors in the Nazi government. Routine public opinion surveys—which were under the purview of Ohlendorf and SS-Major Reinhard Höhn—constituted some of these reports. These public opinion polls on the social climate of Nazi Germany were both unpopular and controversial. In June 1941, Reinhard Heydrich appointed Ohlendorf to be commander of Einsatzgruppe D, which operated in southern Ukraine and Crimea. Joining the Einsatzgruppen was an unappealing prospect and Ohlendorf refused twice before his eventual appointment. Transfers from the RHSA to the Einsatzgruppen were in part due to personnel shortages but also to keep the initial killing operations confined to those who already knew the details, such as Ohlendorf, Arthur Nebe, and Paul Blobel. Einsatzgruppe D was the smallest of the task forces, but was supplemented by Romanians along their way through the killing fields of Bessarabia, southern Ukraine, and the Caucasus. Additional manpower for Einsatzgruppe D came from Ukrainian auxiliary police formations. Supporting military operations, Ohlendorf's group was attached to the Eleventh Army. Ohlendorf's Einsatzgruppe in particular was responsible for the 13 December 1941 massacre at Simferopol, where at least 14,300 people, mostly Jews, were killed. Over 90,000 murders throughout the Ukraine and the Caucusus are attributed to Ohlendorf's unit. Ohlendorf disliked the use of the oft- employed Genickschuß (shot to the back of the neck) and preferred to line up victims and fire at them from a greater distance so as to alleviate personal responsibility for individual murders. All forms of contact between the firing squads and victims were limited—per Ohlendorf's insistence—until the last moments before the killing started, and up to three rifleman were allocated to each person about to be shot. To ensure the group killing mentality, Ohlendorf forbade any commando from taking individual actions and explicitly instructed his men not to take any of the victim's valuables. One of Ohlendorf's most trusted \\"proper\\" military-style murderers, SS-Haupsturmführer Lothar Heimbach, once exclaimed, \\"A man is the lord over life and death when he gets an order to shoot three hundred children—and he kills at least one hundred fifty himself.\\" Many of the killing operations were personally overseen by Ohlendorf, who wanted to ensure they were \\"military in character and humane under the circumstances\\". Such considerations do not constitute mercy by any means and the number of persons killed under the leadership of Einsatzgruppen commanders such as Ohlendorf are \\"staggering\\" despite the use of varying murder techniques. On 1 August 1941, Einsatzgruppen commanders including Ohlendorf, received instructions from Gestapo chief Heinrich Müller to keep headquarters (Hitler especially) informed of their progress in the East; Müller also encouraged the speedy delivery of photographs showing the results of these operations. During September 1941, Ohlendorf's group slaughtered 22,467 Jews and Communists at Nikolayev near Odessa. Due to the Wehrmacht's insistence that the Ukraine's agricultural production was needed to sustain its military campaign, Ohlendorf was asked during October 1941 to refrain from killing some of the Jewish farmers—a request he honored—but one which earned him Himmler's contempt. This act should not be seen as a change of heart or kindness, as just a month prior in September 1941, Ohlendorf reported to his men that \\"from now on the Jewish question is going to be solved and that means liquidation\\". From that month forward, the Einsatzgruppen had begun the process of systematically shooting not just men but women and children, a transition that historian Peter Longerich terms \\"a decisive step on the way towards a policy of racial annihilation\\". Between February and March 1942, Himmler ordered that gas vans should be used to murder women and children so as to reduce the strain on the men, but Ohlendorf reported that many of the Einsatzkommandos refused to utilize them since burying the victims proved an \\"ordeal\\" afterwards. When gas van killing operations were conducted, it was usually at night to keep the population from witnessing the macabre affair. After the victims' deaths, Jewish were forced to unload the bodies, clean the excrement and feces from inside the van's gas chamber, and once the clean up was complete, were themselves immediately shot. As far as Ohlendorf was concerned, the gas vans were impracticable for the scale of killing demanded by Himmler; namely, since they could only kill between fifteen and twenty-five persons at a time. Ohlendorf on 1 March 1948 Historian Donald Bloxham referred to Ohlendorf as a bureaucrat, who was trying to \\"prove himself in the field\\". Another historian, Mark Mazower, described Ohlendorf as a \\"gloomy, driven, self-righteous Prussian\\". His commitment to the Nazi cause kept him in the Ukraine longer than any of his comrades, and while he may have disliked the political direction Germany was headed, he never registered complaints about murdering Jews. He did, however, express misgivings about the barbarity and sadism being meted out by the Romanian units that accompanied the Einsatzgruppen in their murderous tasks, since they were not only leaving a trail of corpses in their wake, they were also pillaging and raping in the process. Not only that, Ohlendorf lodged a complaint about the Romanian forces, who drove thousands of frail elderly persons and children from Bessarabia and Bokovina—all incapable of work—into German-held regions, which his men forced back into Romanian territory but not without killing a significant percentage of them as a result. Ohlendorf devoted only four years (1939–1943) of full-time activity to the RSHA, for in 1943, in addition to his other jobs, he became a deputy director general in the Reich Ministry of economic affairs. Sometime in November 1944, he was promoted to Gruppenführer. Believing their expertise invaluable, Ohlendorf, Ludwig Erhard, and other experts concerned themselves with how to stabilize German currency after the war. Hoping to salvage the reputation of the SD, Ohlendorf offered his services in the hopes that he could shape the postwar reconstruction of Germany, but along \\"National Socialist lines\\", remaining convinced as was Admiral Karl Dönitz (who gave Ohlendorf the economics portfolio), that some form of Nazism would ultimately survive. In May 1945, Ohlendorf participated in Himmler's flight from Flensburg and was arrested with him near Lüneburg along with several other subordinates. Himmler committed suicide shortly after being captured. For several weeks after arrest, Ohlendorf was carefully interrogated, during which he revealed the criminal nature of the German campaign in the East. Nuremberg trials Ohlendorf testifies at the Einsatzgruppen trial, 9 October 1947. During the Einsatzgruppen trial, Ohlendorf was the chief defendant, and was also a key witness in the prosecution of other indicted war criminals. Ohlendorf's apparently reliable testimony was attributed to his distaste for the corruption in Nazi Germany and a stubborn commitment to duty. The court examined Ohlendorf concerning Einsatzgruppen operations in particular. During the trial, Ohlendorf insisted that he, as a loyal Nazi, had acted properly and had done nothing wrong. He expressed no remorse for his actions, telling prosecutor Ben Ferencz that the Jews of America would suffer for what the prosecutor had done, and seemed to have been more concerned about the moral strain on those carrying out the murders than those being murdered. At the trial, Ohlendorf attempted to present the operations in the Soviet area \\"not as a racist programme for the annihilation of all the Jews ... but as a general liquidation order primarily aimed at 'securing' the newly won territory\\". Defending his actions, Ohlendorf compared Einsatzgruppen activities to the Biblical Jewish extirpation of its enemies; he likewise claimed that his firing squads were \\"no worse than the 'press-button killers' who dropped the atom bomb on Japan\\". Despite his attempts to establish moral equivalency for atrocities upon the Allies, Otto Ohlendorf was convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes committed during World War II. He was sentenced to death in April 1948 and spent three years in detention before being hanged at the Landsberg Prison in Bavaria on 8 June 1951.

Versions The stories of the creature known as a rougarou are as diverse as the spelling of its name, though they are all connected to francophone cultures through a common derived belief in the loup- garou (, ). Loup is French for wolf, and garou (from Frankish garulf, cognate with English werewolf) is a man who transforms into an animal. =American folklore= A traditional Cajun Courir de Mardi Gras costume based on a Rougarou (figure on left) \\"Rougarou\\" represents a variant pronunciation and spelling of the original French loup-garou. LSU Cajun-French Glossary According to Barry Jean Ancelet, an academic expert on Cajun folklore and professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in America, the tale of the rougarou is a common legend across French Louisiana. Both words are used interchangeably in southern Louisiana. Some people call the monster rougarou; others refer to it as the loup-garou. The rougarou legend has been spread for many generations, either directly from French settlers to Louisiana (New France) or via the French Canadian immigrants centuries ago. In the Cajun legends, the creature is said to prowl the swamps around Acadiana and Greater New Orleans, and the sugar cane fields and woodlands of the regions. The rougarou most often is described as a creature with a human body and the head of a wolf or dog, similar to the werewolf legend. Often the story-telling has been used to inspire fear and obedience. One such example is stories that have been told by elders to persuade Cajun children to behave. According to another variation, the wolf-like beast will hunt down and kill Catholics who do not follow the rules of Lent. This coincides with the French Catholic loup-garou stories, according to which the method for turning into a werewolf is to break Lent seven years in a row. A common blood sucking legend says that the rougarou is under the spell for 101 days. After that time, the curse is transferred from person to person when the rougarou draws another human's blood. During that day the creature returns to human form. Although acting sickly, the human refrains from telling others of the situation for fear of being killed. The Nicholls Worth; interview with Barry Ancelet Other stories range from the rougarou as a rabbit to the rougarou being derived from witchcraft. In the latter claim, only a witch can make a rougarou--either by turning into a wolf herself, or by cursing others with lycanthropy.New Orleans Gothic legend  In popular culture  The \\"rugaru\\" is mentioned as having come to Dakota consciousness from Ojibwa folktales, and figures both thematically and experientially in the narrative of Peter Mathiessen's In The Spirit of Crazy Horse (Viking, 1983). The NBA team formerly known as the New Orleans Hornets filed for several new name trademarks among which was the Rougarous. The creature is featured in an episode of Cajun Justice, an AE Television show. A camp owner alerted authorities and video taped what he suspected to be a Rougarou in the weeds behind his camp.Cajun Justice, Season 1, Episode 5, \\"A Real Drag\\", 6 June 2012. The legend of the rougarou plays a prominent role in the History Channel television series Cryptid: The Swamp Beast. An unknown creature has been mutilating and killing animals and perhaps humans in southern Louisiana; some locals attribute the attacks to a rougarou.Cryptid: The Swamp Beast, IMDB entry. Similarly, in episode 6 of Swamp Mysteries, Troy Landry discusses the rougarou legend while hunting a creature killing pets at Voodoo Bayou. The novel Hagridden by Samuel Snoek- Brown features heavy usage of the Cajun version of the rougarou. In late 2014, Cedar Point theme park in Sandusky, Ohio announced plans to renovate the existing Mantis roller coaster into \\"Rougarou\\" for the 2015 season. The 2015 short film Atchafalaya centers around a game warden searching in a Louisiana swamp for a missing person who is hinted to have been taken by a loup-garou. The creature is only vaguely seen in the film with a head resembling a bear. Boxer Regis Prograis (of Creole descent) goes by the nickname Rougarou. J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter universe includes wands that contain rougarou hair as their magical core. A “rugaru” is the monster of the week in Season 4, Episode 4 of Supernatural. Supernatural, Season 4, Episode 4, ”Metamorphosis”, IMDB entry. The rougarou is incorporated into the story of an episode of the American television show NCIS: New Orleans.

In the autumn of his three- year-old season, Kingston Town won six races in a row, including the Rosehill Guineas, the Tancred Stakes, the AJC Derby, and the Sydney Cup. At the Brisbane winter carnival, he extended his winning run to eight races by winning twice more, including the Queensland Derby. At season's end, his record stood at 14 wins from 18 starts, and he was named Australia's champion racehorse. The final 23 starts of Kingston Town's career, which produced a further 16 wins, were unusual in that he only raced at the spring carnivals of 1980, 1981, and 1982, and injury prevented him from campaigning at the 1981, 1982, or 1983 autumn carnivals. Each of the three preparations consisted of winning weight-for-age races in Sydney, such as the Warwick Stakes and the George Main Stakes, often against small fields, before racing in Melbourne. In each of the three years, he won the Cox Plate at Moonee Valley, and recorded back-to-back wins in the Caulfield Stakes in 1981 and 1982, but tried and failed to win the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups on multiple occasions. He was third in the 1980 Caulfield Cup, 20th in the 1981 Melbourne Cup, and runner-up in 1982 beaten a neck carrying 59 kg. Kingston Town's win in the 1982 Cox Plate was marked by Bill Collins's famously incorrect prognostication that 'Kingston Town can't win', which was hastily revised to '... he might win yet the champ ... Kingston Town's swamping them ... Kingston Town...' According to The Age's Glenn Lester, 'the call is so intricately woven into the \\"King's\\" history-making third Cox Plate win that it's difficult to decide which was the most memorable element of the race: the broadcast or the victory itself'. Elsewhere, however, it is described as a 'gaffe', and the replay supports this view in that Kingston Town was within a few lengths of the lead at the time. Greg Miles, however, a well-respected racecaller of longstanding, who was also broadcasting the Cox Plate of 1982, states that he also made the same claim as Collins at almost the same time. After running his last race in Australia, in November 1982, Kingston Town was sent to America on 15 February 1984 in an attempt to overcome his leg problems, but he did not race in the United States. He was returned to Australia, and, in 1985, an attempt was made to resurrect his career, but he was scratched from his scheduled race and retired. Retirement Along with Carbine, Phar Lap, Bernborough, and Tulloch, Kingston Town was one of five inaugural inductees into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame. From 30 wins and seven placings from 41 starts, Kingston Town won $1,605,790 in prize money, and was the first horse in Australia to pass the million-dollar barrier. He was given the extraordinary Timeform Rating of 137 - the second highest of any Australian horse in the period (1950s onward). Kingston Town's rating remains well above those of several Cox Plate winners who have won either or both the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups, including Saintly, Might And Power, Northerly, and Makybe Diva. In March 1991, Kingston Town was put down after failing to recover from a leg injury that he suffered while playing with another horse, his favourite paddock-mate.

The senior school has approximately 800 pupils (120 in each of years 7–11 and 100 in each year of the Sixth Form). The current fees stand at £12,000 per year, with bursaries and scholarships available. Due to its location close to Coventry's railway station, the school accommodates pupils from around the West Midlands area, including towns at 30 miles' distance, such as Northampton, Warwick, Balsall Common, Leamington Spa, Kenilworth, Rugby and Nuneaton. The school is situated on an urban site. The buildings are an imposing example of Victorian collegiate architecture. Numerous additional facilities modernise the campus, including a new art complex, drama studio, sports hall, library and, most recently, a swimming pool and fitness suite. In 2015 an extension was also added to the library aiming to provide older students with an area for solitary study. The Junior school has its own building on the same site but the preparatory school is located on a different site entirely, a few minutes away. Although the school is Christian, cultural and religious diversity are heavily engrained in the school's ethos. Pupils are also encouraged to take part in extra-curricular activities including sports played at county, regional and national levels, music, drama, Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, public speaking, chess and a variety of additional academic societies. The school is run by the Coventry School Foundation, a registered charity, and jointly administered with Bablake School under a common Board of Governors. The schools have mutual arrangements such as a common entrance examination, shared astroturf pitches, and similar school uniforms, differing only in the style of tie and the badge on the blazer. The Coventry School Foundation also includes the new Bablake Junior School and King Henry VIII Preparatory School, formed from the merger of Coventry Preparatory School with King Henry VIII Junior School from the beginning of the 2008/9 academic year. The two school sites remain in use by the preparatory school, with the Reception to Y3 classes occupying the old Coventry Preparatory site, which is known as Swallows, in honour of the school's founder. The Y4 to Y6 classes occupy the former King Henry VIII Junior School site, adjacent to the senior school, which is known as Hales in honour of that school's founder. With effect from September 2008, King Henry VIII School began to offer continuity of education from ages 3 to 18. History The school was founded on 23 July 1545 by the Clerk of the Hanaper John Hales as the Free Grammar School under letters patent of King Henry VIII. During the initial foundation of the school it was located in the Whitefriars’ Monastery. Nevertheless, due to religious differences, the school was relocated to the building of the former St. John's Hospital in 1558, where it spent more than 300 years before moving to its present site on the south side of the city in 1885, a building there having been designed for it by Edward Burgess. Much of this original redbrick still stands despite war damage, as well as many expansions. In 1572 the school's administration was conveyed to the Coventry Corporation. It is interesting to mention that in 1573, a deed was legalised by the Mayor of Coventry, according to which, generous endowments were allocated to the school, which were used for the school's overall maintenance, but more particularly, for the sustenance of music as part of the educational curriculum, as the School was the only Grammar school which emphasised the importance of music as part of education. The Free Grammar School offered the students a choice between as many as seventeen subjects, including Greek and Latin (Grammar), Mathematics and Music. Between 1572 and 1600 the reputation of the School had become well known around the West Midlands area, which accounted for a large increase in the number of pupils. The 17th century was the most prosperous period for the School, as the city of Coventry was blooming and regardless of the political and religious controversies in the country, people were finding consolation and shelter in schools. In 1601, the School's library was established and maintained by the donations of affluent contributors, which further enhanced the reputation of the School as a leading educational institution. Nevertheless, during the 18th century, the School experienced major decline and struggle. Due to financial difficulties, the School was required to introduce fees to the students. In an attempt to deal with these struggles the School was divided into two departments: Classical and Commercial. The Commercial subjects were taught at the Schoolroom and were greatest in demand, while the Classical subjects were taught in the library and were specifically aimed at boys willing to attend the University. Specific regulations were set for each of the departments. The first indication of a modern school uniform was introduced as boys attending the Free Grammar School were required to wear College caps. The implemented changes assisted in certain improvements in the performance of the school. In 1878 the School was no longer a “Free Grammar School” and it became an independent institution after being under the administration of the Corporation and the City Authorities for 300 years. The old school premises were condemned and the new buildings, used at the present, were established on Warwick Road in 1885. Further improvements to the curriculum were also implemented and a wide diversity of subjects was introduced. By 1910 the number of pupils had increased and the work and discipline in the school were greatly improved. Over the next several years, the school continued to thrive and in 1926 the Preparatory classes were reinstated. By 1939 the number of boys in the school had grown from 94 in 1901 to approximately 500. The number of pupils continued to grow even during the war times (1939–1945) with over 822 students in the school, 179 of which in the Junior division. Regardless of the damage caused by the bombings over Coventry, which diminished the school's library and other buildings, the school continued to expand and develop. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1975. =Houses and competitions= The four modern-day houses are: *Hales' *Holland's *Sherwyn's *White's A fifth house called King's was abolished in 1996. There are around fifty inter-house events each year, across all years in the school. They include sport, Drama and Music festivals, debating and chess. The points won in each of the House events (four for first down to one for fourth) are totalled to make up the Band Trophy points. =Le Fousseau= In 1991 Le Logis de Fousseau, a manor house in the French Department of Mayenne, was generously donated to the Foundation by Mr Bill Boucher for the use and benefit of the pupils of the Foundation. Le Fousseau is around 15 km from Fougères. The border with Brittany is only a few kilometres to the west and that of Normandy some 20 km to the north. The chateau was typically used for residential trips by students practising French. With effect from September 2012, the school no longer make use of Le Fousseau. The Coventry School Foundation took the decision in 2012 to sell the property. =Publicity= King Henry VIII School's Swimming pool was featured in a BMW ad starring Rebecca Adlington.http://vimeo.com/38932268 In 2016 the King Henry VIII app was launched on iOS and the Google Play Store. In 2017 a large scale advertising campaign was launched by the Senior School in the Coventry and West Midlands area in an attempt to attract new, external, enthusiastic students. Controversies Former headmaster, Terence James Vardon, left his position after pleading guilty to three charges of possessing indecent images of children between 1989 and April 1999. In 1999, John Skermer, a senior teacher was also convicted of taking and possessing photographs of naked boys. Debee Ashby, a teenage glamour model was expelled from the school in 1983 after topless Page 3 pictures were published. In 2012, two pupils were expelled over allegations they sold drugs to other children; three other students were suspended for a term. A teacher at the school, James Anstice, admitted to a charge of causing criminal damage costing £2,500 by destroying a nativity scene at Madame Tussauds featuring David and Victoria Beckham.

The Belvedere Golf Club, home of the Michigan Amateur Golf Championship for many decades in the mid-20th century, is affiliated with the Belvedere Club. The grounds lie partly in Charlevoix Township and partly in Marion Township, in Charlevoix County, Michigan. The club was founded in 1878 by Baptists from Kalamazoo. It was during the late 19th century that many similar summer cottage resort associations were founded across Michigan. The land was divided into lots and leased for construction of summer cottages.

A. J. Van Bilsen in his academic publications (13 June 1913, in Diest – 22 July 1996, in Kraainem), was a Belgian professor who, in December 1955, proposed a 30-year scheme (known as the \\"Van Bilsen Plan\\") for creating a self-sufficient independent state out of the Belgian Congo. Before World War II, Van Bilsen was an active member of the extreme-right Verdinaso party and, in 1942, became a member of the Belgian Resistance. After the war, he travelled in colonial Africa. Van Bilsen is best known for devising a plan for the long-term independence of the Belgian Congo in the 1950s. The timetable, outlined in December 1955 and in a pamphlet entitled Un Plan de Trente Ans pour l'émancipation politique de l'Afrique Belge (1955–56), called for a gradual change over 30 years, the time he estimated it would take to create an educated elite to administrate the new Congo. His plan never came to fruition after Congolese nationalists demanded immediate independence, especially after the Léopoldville Riots of 1959, leading to a period of prolonged political chaos, known as the Congo Crisis, and the eventual seizure of power by Joseph- Désiré Mobutu in 1965. Van Bilsen taught at the Catholic University of Leuven and Ghent University.

Page is often credited with being the first band to bring synthpop music to Sweden. Their music and band members (particularly Eddie Bengtsson) influenced many subsequent Swedish synthpop acts, including Elegant Machinery, S.P.O.C.K, Sista Mannen På Jorden and KieTheVez. Formed in 1980 by Eddie Bengtsson and Marina Schiptjenko, soon joined by Anders Eliasson, the band quickly gained underground cult-status releasing many singles such as Dansande man, Som skjuten ur en kanon, Blå fötter and Som en vind. Though most of their important influential work was released in the 1980s their first album, the self-titled Page, was released in 1991. Page continued releasing music throughout the 90's but is still most fondly remembered in the Swedish synthpop scene for their early singles, especially Dansande Man. Though the band has never officially disbanded, it has been remarkably quiet since a performance at SEMA (Swedish Electronic Music Awards) in 2000 when the band promised nothing new would ever be released under the name Page. However, a compilation covering their two decades of work was released in 2000. After a decade of silence, in 2010 Page released an album of newly recorded material called Nu, and performed two tracks live on Swedish TV show Nyhetsmorgon in May 2010. The album reached number 34 on the official Swedish album chart, Sverigetopplistan, following its release. Page performed at the ElectriXmas events in Malmö in 2012 and 2012, along with other selected shows. The latter appearance was part of a special performance by participants in the Friends of Electronically Yours album project, which was organised to raise money for charity.

Rutledge (January 10, 1926 – June 5, 2006) was a U.S. physics professor, and ufologist.  Early life and career  In 1966, Rutledge completed his Ph.D. in solid state physics at the University of Missouri. He subsequently took the position of Professor and Chairman of the Physics Department at Southeast Missouri State University. He was Department Chairman from 1964 to 1982 and retired from teaching in 1992.  UFO Research  Challenged to explain sightings of unidentified lights and luminous phenomena in the sky around Piedmont, Missouri, Rutledge decided to subject these reports to scientific analysis. He put together a team of observers with college training in the physical sciences, including a large array of equipment: RF spectrum analyzers, Questar telescopes, low-high frequency audio detectors, electromagnetic frequency analyzer, cameras, and a galvanometer to measure variations in the Earth's gravitational field. The resulting Project Identification commenced in April 1973, logging several hundred hours of observation time. This was the first UFO scientific field study, able to monitor the phenomena in real-time, enabling Rutledge to calculate the objects' actual speed, course, position, distance, and size. Observation of the unclouded night sky often revealed \\"pseudostars\\" - stationary lights camouflaged by familiar constellations. Some objects appeared to mimic the appearance of known aircraft; others violated the laws of physics. The most startling discovery was that on at least 32 recorded occasions, the movement of the lights synchronized with actions of the observers. They appeared to respond to a light being switched on and off, and to verbal or radio messages. The final results of this project were documented in the 1981 book, Project Identification: The first Scientific Study of UFO Phenomena. Rutledge died on Monday, June 5, 2006 at the Missouri Veterans Home aged 80.  Books  * Project Identification: The first Scientific Study of UFO Phenomena. Prentice- Hall 1981 by Harley D.

Written by Louis Marks and directed by Mervyn Pinfield and Douglas Camfield, the serial was first broadcast on BBC1 in three weekly parts from 31 October to 14 November 1964. In the serial, the First Doctor (William Hartnell), his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), and her teachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) are shrunk to the size of an inch after the Doctor's time machine the TARDIS arrives in contemporary England. The story's concept was first proposed as the first serial of the show's first season, but was rejected due to its technical complexity and lack of character development. When Marks was commissioned to write the script, he was inspired by Rachel Carson's 1962 environmental science book Silent Spring, the first major documentation on human impact on the environment. The story was originally written and filmed as a four-part serial, but later reduced to three parts; the third and fourth episodes were cut down to form a faster- paced climax. The serial premiered with 8.4 million viewers, maintaining audience figures throughout the three weeks. Retrospective response for the serial was mixed, with criticism directed at its story and characterisation despite praise for its ambition. It later received several print adaptations and home media releases.  Plot  Despite indications of a malfunction in the TARDIS, its fault locator shows nothing is wrong and that it is safe to go outside. The First Doctor (William Hartnell), Ian Chesterton (William Russell), Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill), and Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) consequently explore the vicinity, finding the remains of giant earthworm and ant, which appear to have died instantaneously. The travellers realise they have returned to Earth but have shrunk to the height of an inch. Ian investigates the interior of a discarded matchbox when it is picked up by a government scientist called Farrow (Frank Crawshaw), who is visiting a callous industrialist named Forester (Alan Tilvern) to tell him that his application for a new insecticide called DN6 has been rejected as it is far too deadly to all forms of insect life. News of this appraisal prompts Forester to fatally shoot Farrow. The Doctor, Barbara, and Susan hear the gunshot and head for the house to find Ian unhurt near Farrow's corpse. Forester's aide, Smithers (Reginald Barratt), arrives but does not report the murder for fear of undermining the DN6 project to which he has dedicated his life. Ian and Barbara hide inside Farrow's briefcase to avoid being stepped on by Forester and Smithers, and get separated from the Doctor and Susan after the briefcase is brought inside the house. The Doctor and Susan climb up a drain pipe to find them. Forester alters Farrow's report to give support to the DN6 licence application and, disguising his voice as Farrow’s, makes a supportive phone call to the ministry to the same effect. This is overheard by the local telephone operator Hilda Rowse (Rosemary Johnson) and her policeman husband Bert (Fred Ferris), who suspect something is wrong. Within the house, Ian and Barbara encounter a giant fly, which is killed instantly when it contacts sample seeds that had been sprayed with DN6. Barbara had handled one of these seeds and begins to feel unwell. The Doctor, realising the toxic nature of DN6 and the probable contamination of Barbara, proposes they alert someone by hoisting up the giant telephone receiver, but they cannot make themselves heard. At the telephone exchange, the engaged signal makes Hilda and Bert increasingly concerned. Bert heads off to the house to investigate. The Doctor and his companions decide to attract attention by starting a fire, succeeding in manoeuvring an aerosol can into the flames of the Bunsen burner gas outlet. This coincides with Smithers discovering the true virulence of DN6 and demanding Forester cease his licence application. In the lab, the makeshift bomb explodes in Forester’s face as PC Rowse arrives. Back in the TARDIS, the Doctor succeeds in returning the craft and crew to normal size, a process which cures Barbara of her infection by DN6.  Production  = Conception and writing = The concept of the Doctor and his companions shrinking in size was initially proposed as the first story of the show's first season, written by C. E. Webber and entitled The Giants. After some rewrites, the serial was rejected by show creator Sydney Newman in June 1963 due to its technical complexity and lack of character development. The concept of The Giants was given to writer Robert Gould in mid-1963 to develop as the four-part fourth serial of the first season, but it was dropped by January 1964 due to scripting difficulties. By February 1964, the serial was assigned to writer Louis Marks. The main narrative was inspired by Rachel Carson's 1962 environmental science book Silent Spring, the first major documentation on human impact on the environment. The fictional insecticide featured in the story, DN6, was inspired by incidents described by Carson regarding the impact of DDT on insects. Writer Mark Wilson wrote in 2017 that the story aired during a time where environmental awareness was beginning to develop among the British public. Whitaker commissioned Marks for the serial in May 1964, then titled The Planet of Giants. Mervyn Pinfield was assigned to direct the serial. = Filming = The special effect inserts of a cat were filmed on 30 July 1964 using silent 35mm film, with sound added later during a studio recording. The show's regular cast—Hartnell, Russell, Hill, and Ford—filmed the sequences in which they appeared alongside giant props; the effect was achieved by recording the actors through glass and reflecting the object onto a half-silvered mirror. The footage was later deemed unsatisfactory, and the scenes were re-shot on 13 August. Rehearsals for the first episode took place on 17 August at the London Transport Assembly Rooms, across the road from the BBC Television Centre. Weekly recording for the serial began on 21 August at the Television Centre, Studio 4. Due to Pinfield's other commitments, the fourth and final episode was directed by Douglas Camfield, who had worked as a production assistant to Waris Hussein during the show's first season. The final episode was recorded on 11 September. = Post-production= Planet of Giants is the first Doctor Who serial to feature the work of incidental music composer Dudley Simpson, who first recorded on 14 August 1964. On 19 October 1964, head of serials Donald Wilson decided to reduce the four-part serial to three episodes, as it was felt to be an unsatisfactory opening to the show's second season; he preferred to open the season with the following serial, The Dalek Invasion of Earth, but narrative events prevented the change. The two 24-minute episodes were edited together into a single 25-minute episode from 29 October–2 November to form a faster-paced climax featuring the main characters. Camfield was credited for the final episode.  Reception  = Broadcast and ratings = Planet of Giants was considered a strong debut to the second season, receiving 8.4 million viewers for the first two episodes and 8.9 million for the third. An Audience Research Report on the first episode indicated that the show had gained 17% of the viewing audience. The Appreciation Index increased slightly over the three episodes, from 57 to 59. The BBC Film and Videotape Library did not select the serial for preservation, and the original tapes were wiped in the late 1960s. In 1977, 16mm film prints of the serial were discovered at BBC Enterprises. = Critical response = At the BBC Programme Review Board after the broadcast of the first episode in November 1964, the director-general Hugh Greene was unimpressed by the story's concept; following the second episode's broadcast, he noted his disappointment at the serial and eagerness for the Daleks' return. An Audience Research Report on the first episode noted that the response had been positive, with praise directed at the props and special effects. Retrospective reviews of the serial were mixed. Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times wrote that the story had ambition and impressive set design, but felt that \\"the drama itself is less than enthralling\\". Mulkern noted that Barbara \\"[came] across as uncharacteristically wet\\" and described Simpson's score as \\"annoyingly childish\\". DVD Talks John Sinnott felt that the serial was a \\"solid installment\\", but considered it strange that the main characters do not interact with the criminals. Dave Golder of SFX described the serial as \\"undeniably slow, talky and lacking in excitement\\", particularly criticising Barbara's characterisation. Christopher Bahn of The A.V. Club appreciated the ambition of the serial but felt that it \\"never quite gels together\\" and the condensed final episodes hindered the overall story.  Commercial releases  A novelisation of Planet of Giants, written by Terrance Dicks, was published by Target Books in January 1990. It was the final First Doctor serial to be novelised. Dicks used the original rehearsal script for the first episode and a camera script for the scrapped final episode to restore the missing sequences. The serial was released on VHS by BBC Video in January 2002; it was the first commercially released story to receive the VidFIRE process. 2 Entertain released the serial on DVD in August 2012; the release featured several special features, including audio commentaries, documentaries, and a recreation of the original third and fourth episodes using newly recorded dialogue and animation based on the original scripts.

It is on the East Coastway Line. The station is managed by Southern, who operate all trains serving it. It is one of two railway stations in the town, the other being Hampden Park Station. There are also two other stations in the Eastbourne area, one being Pevensey & Westham, in nearby Westham (near Pevensey), the other being Polegate. Most passenger services along the coast served the station, as they do today. Trains reverse at the station to continue their journey along the East Coastway by using a junction north of Hampden Park railway station; services run either east (to Bexhill, Hastings and Ashford International) or west via Lewes (to Brighton or London Victoria) from the station. History The single track branch line to Eastbourne from Polegate on the Brighton to Hastings line was opened by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) on 14 May 1849.Handbook of Stations ... on the Railways of Great Britain and Ireland British Transport Commission (Railway Clearing House) 1956 As the town became an ever more popular seaside resort two further stations followed: the first in 1866 and the present station, designed by F.D. Brick, in 1886. There was a rarely used triangular junction between Polegate and the now-closed Stone Cross which allowed trains to bypass the Branch; the track for this has now been lifted. =First station= Very little is known about the first station, except it was a timber structure and was used between 1849 and 1866 when the station building was moved to Wharf Road and became a dwelling for railway families. A new station was rebuilt. The location of the first station was said to be in Upperton Road, between the site of the current station and the Royal Mail sorting office.plate 104, Brighton to Eastbourne by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press 1985 There is no record known on how many platforms the first station had. =Present station= Eastbourne in 1994 Eastbourne in 2006 With the increase in services serving Eastbourne, now a popular resort, under LB&SCR; Chief Engineer Frederick Banister a station was resited a little to the east in 1872 and rebuilt in 1886 and designed by F.D. Brick, in 1886. which a vaulted canopy and lantern roof, similar to Lewes. The station had 4 platforms which increased in length over the years. There was also two run around loops between platforms 2 and 3. Over the years one of the runaround loops was lost as platforms 1 and 2 was built wider. On 12 April 1977 platform 4 was shortened from a 12 coach to an 8 coach length to make way for the ring road construction.plate 118, Brighton to Eastbourne by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press 1985 It was then taken out of use and the track lifted during the Eastbourne re-signalling in 1991 =Goods station and yards= A goods station and yard was built north of the present station, on the site of the first station and was accessed from the mainline north of the station. Also to the north of the station was an extensive coal depot and industrial sidings including the Crumbles siding. The goods shed still survives today as the Enterprise Shopping Centre and the goods yard surrounding it is now the station car park. The site of the former coal sidings to the northeast of the station is now occupied by a car dealership. =Locomotive depot= Eastbourne carriage sidings, May 2005. Site of the first engine shed The LB&SCR; opened a small engine shed in 1849 which was demolished in 1876. It was replaced by a semi-roundhouse in 1876, which was demolished in 1912.plate 111, Brighton to Eastbourne by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press 1985 A larger, seven-road (seven track) shed was opened in 1911, but this was badly damaged by bombing in the Second World War and was never repaired. The shed was closed in 1952, but the site continued to be used as a store for locomotives awaiting scrapping until 1965, when diesel locomotives were stored there until 1968; the shed was demolished in 1969.plate 18, Eastbourne to Hastings by Vic Mitchell & Keith Smith, Middleton Press 1985 The site of the first engine shed is now occupied by the current carriage sidings, whilst the site of the later shed is now wasteland. =Signal Box= Eastbourne signal box The current signal box was built in 1882 and had an impressive 108 Lever frame controlling the station, goods yard and carriage sidings, this was later replaced on 14 November 1934 with a 72 lever frame. In 1991 the signal box was changed into a power signal box when the semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals and an \\"entrance-exit\\" control system installed. The signal box closed in 2015 with the re-signalling of the line between Lewes and Bexhill controlled from a new signalling centre at Three Bridges =Listed status= Eastbourne station was listed at Grade II on 3 July 1981. Accidents There has been only one railway accident in Eastbourne. On 25 August 1958, a Glasgow to Eastbourne sleeper train collided with an Ore to London Bridge service killing 5, leaving 22 with serious injuries and 18 with minor.

An overnight train also ran from Glasgow Central. Long-distance services again ran between 1988 and 1996, branded InterCity Holidaymaker. Between 1996 and 1997, Virgin CrossCountry ran a Saturday-only service to Glasgow Central in the morning and Manchester Piccadilly in the afternoon.Inter regional loco hauled services from Brighton 1983 =Former local services= Until 14 June 1965, a local service from Eastbourne ran via the Cuckoo Line to Tunbridge Wells West and later to Tonbridge. Between 15 June 1965 and 9 September 1968 a shuttle service ran to Hailsham.  Services  The typical off-peak service from the station is: *2tph (trains per hour) to London Victoria via the East Coastway line (both semi-fast) *2tph to Brighton via the East Coastway Line (both semi-fast) *1tph to Ashford International via the East Coastway Line and Marshlink line (stopping) *2tph to Ore via the East Coastway Line (1 fast 1 stopping) *1tph to Hastings (fast) There are additional peak services to London Bridge.

As well as the Stourbridge ironworks, the business owned a number of coal and ironstone mines, furnaces, forges and other works in the Black Country and near Ironbridge. The business continued long after James Foster's death, ultimately being incorporated as John Bradley (Stourbridge) Ltd in the early 20th century. In the late 19th century, the company was a member of the Marked Bar Association, whose members were the makers of the highest quality bar iron of the time. Foster was also a partner in other companies including the engineering firm Foster, Rastrick and Company, which built the first steam locomotive to run on rails in the USA. He was also a banker and landowner as well as being elected Member of Parliament and appointed as Improvement Commissioner for Stourbridge, and High Sheriff of Worcestershire. Biography The Bradley and Foster family home, Lower High Street, Stourbridge James Foster was the son of Henry and Mary Foster (née Haden). He was born on 9 May 1786 and baptised on 11 May 1786. The family house, which still exists, was in an area of Stourbridge then called Digbeth, now numbered 7 and 8 Lower High Street. Mary's first husband, Gabriel Bradley from Stourbridge, had left her his iron business on his death in 1771. John Bradley, Mary's son by her first husband, founded the company John Bradley & Co., in 1800 taking a lease on land near the canal at Stourbridge with the aim of developing an ironworks. The deed of partnership for the company was drawn up in 1802 which granted a share in the company to Bradley's six half-brothers and sisters (which included James Foster). By 1813 only John Bradley and James Foster had shares in the company and on Bradley's death in 1816, James Foster took control of the enterprise, which included the Stourbridge Iron Works. In 1818, Foster leased mines at Wombridge, Shropshire with an agreement to build blast furnaces there within 18 months. Foster formed a subsidiary partnership with John Urpeth Rastrick in Stourbridge which traded as Foster, Rastrick and Company. The company was in existence from 1819 to 1831, and at the leading edge of iron technology; producing a wide range of products such as blast furnaces and rolling mill equipment, sugar mills for export to the West Indies, iron 'bearers' (beams) for important buildings of the age, wrought iron rails, and four early steam locomotives. Of these 'The Agenoria' worked on the Kingswinford Railway, near Stourbridge and is now in the National Railway Museum, York. The other three were ordered by the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company and exported to the United States. The 'Stourbridge Lion' became the first steam locomotive to run on a commercial railway at Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Unfortunately it proved too heavy for the wooden track and after a few trial runs was removed. A few components remain in the Smithsonian Museum, Washington D.C. The 'New Foundry' built in 1821, with a magnificent iron roof structure spanning , produced components for the company and continued working as a foundry until early in the 21st century. For many years standing semi-derelict, the building has now been intelligently restored and is in use again as a medical centre for Stourbridge people. Foster formed a partnership with Thomas Jukes Collier (Thomas Jukes Collier & Co), which carried out mining in the Hadley area from around 1820. On 20 February 1821, Foster obtained a patent for \\"certain improvements in the manufacture of wrought malleable iron\\". In 1820s, Foster entered into a partnership with George Jones and John Barker, both of Wolverhampton, to construct the Chillington Ironworks. The three partners patented an improved method of producing malleable iron in 1832. They invented a method of conveying the molten iron produced in a blast furnace into the puddling furnace without the intermediate stage of producing solid pig iron. Foster's first entry into politics was in 1825 when he was appointed an Improvement Commissioner for the town of Stourbridge. He lobbied for a new Improvement Act, passed in 1825, which enabled the Commissioners to construct a market hall for the town. James Foster later became a member of parliament, as a Whig, for Bridgnorth (1831–1832), although he rarely took part in debates, and High Sheriff of Worcestershire in 1840. James Foster's home from 1833 was Stourton Castle In 1828, Foster acquired the Madeley Court estate. Here he commenced mining operations, sinking 17 pits in total. Later (in 1843), Foster had blast furnaces constructed nearby. In 1833, Foster acquired a lease of Stourton Castle for £10,000. He subsequently modernised and added to the building, employing the architect Sir Robert Smirke to provide the designs. In 1834 Foster met with a number of industrialists to found the Stourbridge and Kidderminster Banking Co. James Foster became the Chairman of the bank, an office he held until 1850. The first branch of the bank was sited at Park House just off Stourbridge High Street, which had been Foster's previous home. IN 1844, James Foster was listed as being on the Committee of Management of the company that proposed to build the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway. James Foster was buried in the family vault at St Mary's, Oldswinford A brief profile of Foster in Griffiths' Guide to the Iron Trade of Great Britain, describes him as: \\"a most able and far seeing man, divested entirely of consequential airs and assumed superiority, endowed in a very remarkable degree with common sense; being afflicted with deafness, his manner sometimes appeared brusque, owing to his prompt and decisive answers. He was a decided Liberal in politics, and a truly good, kind-hearted gentleman\\". After his death, aged 66, which occurred on 12 April 1853, it was reported that one thousand of his workers paraded after the funeral cortege. He was interred in the family vault at St Mary's, Oldswinford. He was unmarried, and his iron business and estates were inherited by his nephew, William Orme Foster.

The distance between two of the points is added to the position of the third (very often the ascendant) to derive the location of the lot. History The lots are a very ancient astrological technique which can be traced back to pre-Hellenistic sources. Their origin is obscure; they could originally be Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Magian, Persian or Hermetic, but by the time of Dorotheus of Sidon in the first century A.D. (and probably earlier) they had become an established tenet of Hellenistic astrological practice. One of the best informational sources for the lots is the Introduction to astrology by fourth-century astrologer Paulus Alexandrinus and the Commentary on this work by sixth-century philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger. Paulus used a dozen or so major lots for almost every aspect of his analysis. The most important of these were the Lot of Fortune (or Part of Fortune) and its complement, the Lot of Spirit. After the fall of the Roman Empire, all of the classical legacy, including astrology, fell to the Abbasid Arabs and Persians. Arab astrologers translated sources from Greek and produced many of their own astrologers who wrote a considerable amount in Arabic on astrology. Although it is not clear whether the number of lots began to proliferate in late Antiquity or whether it was purely the product of the fascination the Arabs had for them, Arabic manuscripts show an explosion in the number of lots that were used over the next several centuries. The inordinate increase is noted by the Arab commentators themselves. In The Abbreviation of the Introduction to Astrology, Persian astrologer Abu Ma'Shar (787-886) describes no less than 55 lots, although it's clear that these are only the ones he considers significant. This count does not even include all of the lots of Paulus. Beginning in the tenth century, many Arabic manuscripts were translated into Latin, becoming the means by which Classical astrology found its way back to Europe. Medieval astrologers, most notably the major 13th-century Italian, Guido Bonatti, a contemporary of Dante, assumed it was the Arabs who originated the concept of the lots, and hence they came eventually to be called the \\"Arabic parts\\". By the time of William Lilly, only the Lot of Fortune continued to be used by astrologers, although in a manner that would be considered strange by ancient practitioners. Lilly's methods with what he called \\"Fortuna\\" have continued in modern astrology, although rarely used and usually misunderstood. The Lot of Fortune mainly appears today in horary practice. Calculating the Lot of Fortune Lilly's Part of Fortune (or Pars Fortunae) is calculated as Ascendant + Moon - Sun. That is, the degrees of distance (going in the direction of the signs) between the Sun and the Moon is calculated and then that same distance is measured from the point of the ascendant. The same procedure was used by the Arabs and by Hellenistic astrologers to calculate the Lot of Fortune but there were two major differences: * The location of the lot varied considerably in charts where the Sun was above the horizon (that is, a daytime chart, or one of diurnal sect) or below the horizon (a nighttime chart, or one of nocturnal sect). The day charts follow Lilly's procedure; nighttime charts reverse the direction in which the measurement is taken between the Sun and Moon, so that the astrologer measures from the Moon to the Sun (again, going in the direction of the signs) to get this arc. As with day charts, the arc is then measured from the ascendant to get the lot. The two formulas are, therefore: ** Day chart: Ascendant + Moon - Sun ** Night chart: Ascendant - Moon + Sun * Interpretatively, the Lot of Fortune was used to represent the body, fortune, and health. It was also used in place of the ascendant thereby changing the house numbering, to find out more about these factors. Lilly and his contemporaries used the Lot of Fortune as a simple indicator of material well- being and, in horary charts, a marker of success. The Lot of Spirit If the Lot of Fortune deals with material well-being, the body, fortune and health, the Lot of Spirit represents the initiative taken by that person, or what use is made of what is given. The Lot of Spirit is the reverse of the Lot of Fortune, giving the following formulas: * Day chart: Ascendant - Moon + Sun * Night chart: Ascendant + Moon - Sun The Hermetic lots The Hermetic lots are a specific set of seven lots, each associated with one of the seven visible planets (including the Sun and Moon), that were attributed to the figure Hermes Trismegistus in the Hellenistic tradition of astrology.Chris Brennan, \\"The Theoretical Rationale Underlying the Seven Hermetic Lots,\\" originally published in the Tradition Journal, issue no. 2, spring 2009, pgs. 16-27. This set of lots appears in the work of the 4th century astrologer Paulus Alexandrinus, as well as in his later commentator Olympiodorus the Younger. The formulas for the lots can be found in Paulus (see reference below). The formulas for the Hermetic lots later made their way into the Medieval astrological tradition where they appear in authors such as Abu Ma'shar and Guido Bonatti, although their lists have been combined with an alternate lot tradition derived from the 2nd century astrologer Vettius Valens.

It is known for its beach, Morriscastle, which was listed by the Irish Times as one of the Top 5 beaches in Ireland.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/travel/50-great- irish-beaches-1.2736163/ History The village is in the civil parish of KilmuckridgeKilmuckridge (civil parish) Placenames Database of Ireland. Retrieved: 2012-02-20. and in the Catholic parish of Litter (from the Irish language Leitir, meaning a hillside). On older maps, the village is sometimes referred to by its older name of Ford, or The Ford. The name Kilmuckridge originally referred to a small road junction about 1.5 km from the main village and site of the Church of Ireland church. This junction was previously the location of the village post office and it is said that when the post office was moved to The Ford, the latter placename gradually declined in use. Morriscastle, was once the site of a castle belonging to a prominent Gaelic family. By the 19th century, this castle was in ruins, and it was demolished in 1936. It was succeeded by a later castle, owned by the Annesley family, the ruins of which can be seen to the south of the roadway. Wells House has a history dating back to the 1600s. The local Roman Catholic church was built in 1796. The Church of Ireland church dates from 1815. The graveyard next to the Church of Ireland church also contains the remains of members of the Catholic Church, with a \\"sailor's hole\\" for the bodies of sailors washed ashore. The village also has a historic graveyard at Killincooley with a holy well.http://aboutthisplace.ie/Kilmuckridge.html Several Kilmuckridge people played a part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, with one of its most prominent leaders being John Murphy of nearby Boolavogue. Local participants were said to have rendezvoused at a local site known as Hatter's Bridge before proceeding to battle at the Battle of Oulart Hill. There are no listed shipwrecks off Morriscastle but several have occurred in the general area, including the clipper ship Pomona, which ran aground off Ballyconigar in 1859 while en route from Liverpool to New York and sank with the loss of nearly four hundred people, mostly poor Irish people.http://www.irishshipwrecks.com/shipwrecks.php?search_name=&county;=14&date;_from=&date;_to=&off;_number=http://www.wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?158471 Additionally, a 61-ton coal boat named the Lavinia was wrecked at Tinnaberna in 1915.http://www.irishwrecksonline.net/Lists/WexfordListF.htm On 14 November 1815, twenty-four local fishermen were lost in a storm, having sailed from Tinnaberna. The disaster is said to have left nineteen widows and would have had a significant long-term impact on the population of the small settlement which lay at Tinnaberna. The disaster was largely forgotten, commemorated mainly in a local ballad,http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/Ran042.html but interest has revived due to the unveiling of a memorial plaque on the two-hundredth anniversary in 2015.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_11Cx7KCuY Another local ballad commemorates the 1885 rescue of a sailing ship, the Vivandiere, which had been abandoned by her crew and set adrift. The ship was boarded near Tinnaberna by local men, who later profited from its salvage.http://www.fresnostate.edu/folklore/ballads/Ran112.htmlhttp://www.countysongs.ie/song/rescue- of-the-vivandier The Tithe Applotment Books contain data for the parish of Kilmuckridge for the year 1833.http://titheapplotmentbooks.nationalarchives.ie/search/tab/results.jsp?surname=&firstname;=&county;=Wexford&townland;=&parish;=kilmuckridge&search;=Search&sort;=townland_sort&pageSize;=10&pager.offset;=160 Griffith's Valuation was completed for County Wexford in 1854, and data for Kilmuckridge can be found here.http://www.askaboutireland.ie/griffith- valuation/index.xml?action=doPlaceSearch&Submit.x;=21&Submit.y;=6&freetext;=kilmuckridge&countyname;=WEXFORD&baronyname;=&unionname;=&parishname;=KILMUCKRIDGE The 1901 Census holds details of households in the Kilmuckridge area.

Redmond claimed to be a descendant of John Murphy (of the 1798 Rebellion) and was active in Enniscorthy in the 1916 Rising; having survived, he became involved with Sinn Féin and served three months in prison in 1920 for fundraising. He was elected as a councillor in the district of Gorey. On 14 August 1920, he was part of a company of men that set fire to the Royal Irish Constabulary barracks on the road to Morriscastle. Although Redmond's recollection attests that the building was 'completely destroyed', the house has been restored over the years and is inhabited today. Redmond and his colleagues also set fire to the coast guard station at Morriscastle in July 1921. A local anecdote tells that many years later, some local men were injured in an explosion while working at Redmond's property due to a homemade explosive that Redmond had hidden. Jim O'Brien was shot dead by members of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Rathdrum, County Wicklow, on 12 February 1920, during the Irish War of Independence. At the time, he was an IRA commandant and the officer commanding the East Wicklow Brigade. A plaque in Market Square, Rathdrum, commemorates the shooting. In April 2016, a memorial stone was unveiled to commemorate local participants in the 1916 Rising.http://www.independent.ie/regionals/goreyguardian/localnotes/kilmuckridge- holds-a-1916-weekend-34600037.html The lives of Redmond, O'Brien and their colleagues contrast with another prominent local man of the same era, Tom Ryan (1873-1958), who joined the British Army as a teenager and saw active service in South Africa, France and Palestine. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and later joined the army of the Irish Free State. He was well known, and his father's funeral in 1920 was said to have been attended by fifteen priests and a very large cortege. He remained prominent in Wexford life and his love of his childhood home is evident in his poetry. As one local historian describes: :\\"Tom Ryan, like all poets and literary persons lived imaginatively, in a parallel universe that both represented and re-ordered his life experience: the homely places, the touching scenes and drama of his childhood memories of Tinnaberna. There is an ambiguity is the basic message of his poetry: it may be a means of providing an ethical rationale to his military career but conversely it may be that the stellar success of many of his playmates on the strand at Tinnaberna, and indeed his own success, are meant as mere adornments to his poetic wonder-world of Tinnaberna by the sea.\\"http://www.esatclear.ie/~lorcand/tommcdonald.htm During World War 2, the area saw three plane crashes. On 29 September 1940, an RAF Hawker Hurricane crash-landed in the townland of Ballyvadden, having taken part in an aerial skirmish off the coast. The aircraft was one of eight sent from Pembrey, Wales to intercept a group of German bombers heading for Liverpool. The RAF pilot was unhurt in the crash and was interned at The Curragh before escaping back to Britain and subsequently getting killed the following year. His Canadian- built aircraft was repaired, bought by the Irish Air Corps and flown until 1946. Of the German aircraft downed in the skirmish, the body of a German airman washed ashore near Kilmuckridge and was initially buried in the sailor's hole at the old graveyard, before later reinterment elsewhere.http://aboutthisplace.ie/Kilmuckridge.htmlhttp://www.csn.ul.ie/~dan/war/crashes.htm In May 1941, a German Heinkel He 111 bomber crashed in the sea and sank near the Blackwater lightship, with two recorded fatalities. Two survivors came ashore in a liferaft and were treated hospitably by a local priest before their internment at The Curragh.http://aboutthisplace.ie/Kilmuckridge.html In 1945, an American Martin Marauder aircraft crashed at Killenagh, with no fatalities.http://www.csn.ul.ie/~dan/war/crashes.htm Tourism Morriscastle Beach Morriscastle Beach at sunset, looking south towards Tinnaberna and Wexford town., 4 September 2012 The local beaches are a tourism attraction of the area, part of a long stretch of unbroken sandy beach that connects Cahore to Raven Point. Morriscastle, the largest beach, is used by swimmers, walkers, horse riders and anglers, and is the focal point for a cluster of holiday home developments, caravan parks and camp sites. As of 2019, the beach holds a Blue Flag award,https://beachawards.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Blue- Flag-2019-Ireland-Map.pdf granted due to its water quality, safety, well- managed environment and local services.http://www.blueflagireland.org/ Other beaches nearby include Ballinoulart, Tinnaberna and Ballynamon. The local coast is host to some rare flora and fauna and is part of a national heritage site, Kilmuckridge-Tinnaberna Sandhills. A substantial wind farm, Ballywater Wind Farm, is located near Ballinoulart beach. Fish which are caught in the area include bass and flounder, and a small number of local boats still trawl for herring in the early winter. Kilmuckridge contains a number of historical buildings as well as restaurants, guesthouses, pubs, and shops. Blackwater Golf Course is located about five kilometres from Kilmuckridge. Sport Kilmuckridge's local GAA club is Buffers Alley, which is shared with the neighbouring village of Monamolin and based at Ballinastraw. It is predominantly a hurling and camogie club but also fields teams in junior Gaelic football. The club's hurling won the 1989 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, becoming the first Wexford team to do so. As of 2012, the club has won twelve Wexford Senior Hurling Championship titles, all in a period from 1968 to 1992. Players of this period included Tony Doran, Colm Doran, Mick Butler, Henry Butler, and Tom Dempsey. Buffer's Alley's camogie team also has several national successes, winning the All-Ireland Senior Club Camogie Championship five times in a six-year period from 1979 to 1984, jointly making it the competition's most successful team, until being surpassed some years later by St Paul's Camogie Club of Kilkenny. The local soccer club is St Joseph's, which is based at Grove Park in the centre of Kilmuckridge. Aside from the beaches mentioned above, the locality has some running and walking routes. These include a loop around Ballinlow lane (5.2 km), from the village to Morriscastle Beach (3.1 km), along the beach from Morriscastle to Tinnaberna (4.6 km) and from Tinnaberna to the village (4.4 km). Transport The village is located approximately 119 kilometres from central Dublin via the M11/N11 National Primary Route, exiting near Gorey. The village lies on the R742 regional road south of Gorey, but many locals take the R741 regional road. Wexford town is a further 24 km south. Bus Éireann local route 379 serves the village. Windfarm at Ballinoulart near Kilmuckridge Arts The village hosts the annual Kilmuckridge Drama Festival, which has been running since the 1950s. In April 2015, the village hosted the All- Ireland Confined Drama Finals.http://kilmuckridgedramafestival.com/ Local band The Jades finishing as runners-up on the RTÉ series You're a Star during the 2000s.

Bourne Eau is a short river which rises in the town of Bourne in Lincolnshire, England, and flows in an easterly direction to join the River Glen at Tongue End. It is an embanked river, as its normal level is higher than that of the surrounding Fens. It was navigable in the 18th and 19th century, but now forms an important part of the drainage system that enables the surrounding fen land to be used for agriculture. Course Bourne Eau outside the Abbey Church at Bourne. The iron bridge is dated 1832. Bourne Eau rises in , otherwise known as St Peter's Pool, in Bourne, Lincolnshire. The Wellhead is a natural artesian spring which once formed the source of the water defences of Bourne Castle as well as the power for the town's three mills. On entering Bourne North Fen it follows an artificial course which it was given, probably, in the first half of the thirteenth century when the south Lincolnshire Fens ceased to be a Royal forest. Hitherto, it had occupied the channel known as the Old Ea which was of Roman date, most likely second century. The present course enters the River Glen at , a name which derives from the low tongue of land within the enclosing banks of the rivers. Apart from the spring, most of the water of the river is collected by the Car Dyke, which, near Bourne, is arranged to act as a catchwater drain, gathering the surface water of the upland and feeding it via the Bourne Eau and River Glen to the sea, without its entering The Fens. History The location of the terminus of the Bourne Eau Navigation at Bourne From 1765, the north bank of the river was the responsibility of the Black Sluice Commissioners, a body which had been created by an Act of Parliament, to construct the Black Sluice where the South Forty-Foot Drain entered The Haven at Boston, and to supervise the drainage of the Fens feeding that system. The north bank was a serious problem, as it was built on a peat subsoil, and defied attempts to raise it, with the result that the Bourne Fens often flooded. Improvements to the of river from the River Glen junction to the town of Bourne were authorised by an act of Parliament obtained on 29 March 1781, which suggested that the river had previously been navigable, but had become choked with mud. The act created a body of 12 trustees, who were empowered to maintain a channel which was wide by deep. The navigation included two locks, one near the junction with the Glen, and the other near Bourne. In order to ease the problems caused by the north bank, the Black Sluice Commissioners negotiated with the Trustees to allow them to build a set of flood gates at Tongue End, where the river joined the Glen, and an overfall weir, which allowed surplus water to flow over the bank and into the Weir Dyke in Bourne Fen. The self-acting doors were replaced by a sluice in the 1860s, which effectively brought navigation to an end, and the sluice was replaced by a pumping station in 1966, which removed the need for the overfall weir. Linguistic derivations The use of the French-seeming Eau as the name of a Fenland river is not unique. It appears to have arisen in the eighteenth century. The earlier term was Ea, which arises from an Anglo-Danish word for river. Compare the Danish aa, nowadays written å. This Danish, one-letter word is pronounced as a French o but shortened by a glottal stop or as a curt English aw as a pure vowel rather than a diphthong. The eighteenth century engineers and map-makers seem to have been more familiar with French than with Danish. However, in the German-speaking parts of Schleswig-Holstein, rivers which across the border in Denmark, fit this nomenclature are called Au, which is not widely different from the English pronunciation of Eau. The following is extracted from the Wikipedia article on Aachen. \\"The Romans named the hot sulphur springs there, Aquis-Granum. For the origin of the Granus several theories were developed, but it is now widely accepted that it derives from the Celtic god of water and health. The hot springs have been channelled into baths since Roman times, and these are still in use. The element ‘’âh’’- is an Old German cognate with Latin ‘’aqua’’, both meaning \\"water\\". In French- speaking areas of the former Empire the word ‘’aquas’’ was turned into ‘’aix’’, hence Aix-en-Provence is an old Roman spa in Provence.\\" Thus, the use of the French word for water, eau is not after all, so inappropriate. A bourne is a stream flowing from a spring. Thus, although the town in which it rises is called Bourne and this apparently gives rise to the river's name, the Bourne Eau is clearly the bourne in question. Bourne is the southern English cognate of the burn of northern English. However, in later use, each has begun to lose its association with the spring, burn the more so. Wheeler gives the name Bourne Old Ea to what is now the Bourne Eau and Bourne Ea or Brunne Ea to that part of the Glen downstream of Kate's Bridge. He then quotes Dugdale, and an act of Queen Elizabeth I: :Brunne, River of, Brunne Hee,Burne Alde Ee. In Dugdale the Brunne Ee is describhed in the margin as 'now the Glene'...'Which had its course through the midst of the town of Pincbec.' The 'Ware' Dyke is described as extending along 'the river of Burne Ee to Godramscote' in a commission of Sewers held at Hempringingham in Queen Elisabeth's time.

Examples are antiques or jewelry. The term originated with the historical principle of an heirloom in English law, a chattel which by immemorial usage was regarded as annexed by inheritance to a family estate. Loom originally meant a tool. Such genuine heirlooms were almost unknown by the beginning of the twentieth century.  English legal history  In the English legal system, any owner of a genuine heirloom could dispose of it during his lifetime, but he could not bequeath it by will away from the estate. If the owner died intestate, it went to his heir-at-law, and if he devised the estate it went to the devisee. The word subsequently acquired a secondary meaning, applied to furniture, pictures, etc., vested in trustees to hold on trust for the person for the time being entitled to the possession of a settled house. Such things were more properly called settled chattels. As of 1 January 1997, no further settled land can be created and the remaining pre- existing settlements have a declining importance in English law.Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, s.2 An heirloom in the strict sense was made by family custom, not by settlement. A settled chattel could be sold under the direction of the court, and the money arising under such sale is capital money.Settled Land Act 1882 The court would only sanction such a sale, if it could be shown that it was to the benefit of all parties concerned and if the article proposed to be sold was of unique or historical character.

It is on the East Coastway Line, from , and train services are provided by Southern.  History  =First station= The first station opened on 27 June 1846 when the London and Brighton Railway built a line from Brighton to Hastings via Lewes. The station was built at Polegate to serve the nearby towns of Hailsham and South Bourne, the latter now part of Eastbourne. The first station was on the site of the present station. It then became a junction station on 14 May 1849 when an east facing branch headed northwards to Hailsham was opened and another southwards to Eastbourne, the station had enlarged to three through platforms and a bay platform for Hailsham services. The station then also had a one road engine shed and small freight yard complete with granary and weighing machine. =Second station= In 1881 the second station was opened in connection with the construction of a new westward facing line to Hailsham and the 1880 extension of the Cuckoo Line to Eridge, and the re-aligned branchline to Eastbourne which the present line follows today. The second station had four through platforms. The East Coastway line through Polegate was electrified in 1935 bringing in faster more frequent services. In 1965 the Cuckoo line north of Hailsham was closed followed in 1968 by complete closure of the branch to Hailsham. On 6 January 1969 the spur line to Pevensey (Stone Cross Junction) was closed and the up line was lifted, leaving the down line open for departmental trains until 1974 when the line became a mile long engineers siding with access only from Stone Cross Junction, this was then lifted in August 1984. and once extensive goods sidings were gradually closed and removed. Second Polegate Station before it was demolished Station platforms of the second station in March 1986 The station closed in 1986 when a newer station opened 440 yards west, although caused controversy when the subway under the station connecting the platforms was also closed as it offered a short cut for non rail travellers to cross from one side of the town to the other without walking towards the high street and using the level crossing. The level crossing is the only means from crossing from one side of the town to the other. The street level building was demolished in May 2017. =Present station= The current building is the third station to be built in Polegate and is on the site of the original station. It was completed in 1986 by Network SouthEast, and officially opened by Ian Gow in 1987. The station has a booking hall, and three waiting rooms. A footbridge connects both platforms although step-free access is available by the Level Crossing. The site of the goods yard is now developed with a shopping precinct and car park to the north of the station and a housing estate to the south-east of the station. The closed lines to Hailsham and Pevensey are still evident. The trackbed of the branch to Heathfield is now a cycle path – Cuckoo Trail – beginning at the north end of the town. The trackbed to Pevensey is mostly intact with the A22 road cutting through the route. Signal boxes In its heyday, Polegate had three signal boxes, Polegate 'A' or West, Polegate 'B' or East and Polegate Crossing. Polegate 'A' signal box was situated at the western end of the station and controlled the junction for the Cuckoo Line to Hailsham and Eridge and the goods yard. Polegate 'B' signal box, situated at the eastern end of the station controlled the junction for Eastbourne and Hastings based services. Polegate Crossing which controlled the level crossing was abolished in February 2015. The Polegate Crossing signal box was subsequently demolished overnight between 14 and 18 November 2016.  Services  The typical off-peak service is: *2tph to Ore (via Eastbourne). *1tph to Hastings *2tph to London Victoria (via Haywards Heath). *2tph to Brighton. *1tph to Eastbourne. After the introduction of the new timetable in May 2018, the express service to Ashford International and Brighton was discontinued. Now, all Ashford bound services begin at Eastbourne.  Station facilities  * Booking Office * Three waiting rooms, one on Eastbourne platform and two on the Lewes platform * Automated Ticket Gates on both platforms * Automated announcements * Two ticket issuing machines for selling tickets and collecting pre-paid tickets.

He was known to the Native Americans as Don Benito because of his benevolent manner in his treatment of Native American affairs. Wilson, a native of Tennessee, was a fur trapper and trader before coming to California. Detained in Southern California while attempting to obtain passage to China, Wilson decided to remain there. He married Ramona Yorba, daughter of Bernardo Yorba, a wealthy and prominent landowner, and purchased part of Rancho Jurupa in what would become Riverside County. Wilson was made Justice of the Peace for the Inland Territory and was entrusted with the care of Native American affairs. He was also commissioned to deal with the hostile Ute tribe over their cattle rustling and other crimes against the ranchers. His marriage to his second wife, Margaret Hereford produced a daughter Ruth who would later be mother to General George S. Patton Jr. commander of U.S. and allied forces during World War II. Wilson became the first non-Hispanic owner of Rancho San Pascual, which encompassed today's towns of Pasadena, Altadena, South Pasadena, Alhambra, San Marino and San Gabriel. Wilson was the second elected Mayor of Los Angeles for one term (1851-1852), Los Angeles County Supervisor 3 terms (1853, 1861, 1862-64) and served three terms as a California State Senator. Life in California =Rancho Jurupa= Wilson came to California with the Workman-Rowland Party in 1841 seeking passage to China. In 1842 Wilson bought a key portion of Rancho Jurupa from Juan Bandini, a section that would later be named Rancho Rubidoux. Encompassing most of present-day Rubidoux, California, as well as a significant portion of downtown Riverside, Wilson became the first permanent settler in the Riverside area.Patterson, Tom. Landmarks of Riverside, and the Stories Behind Them. The Press~Enterprise Co., 1964, Page 19. In 1844 he married his first wife, Ramona Yorba, whose father Bernardo Yorba, was the prominent Spanish (Mexican) landholder of Rancho Cañón de Santa Ana. Wilson gained esteem and was often asked to assist with Native American affairs.Wilson (1852) Wilson accepted by becoming Justice of the Peace of the Inland Territory. =Big Bear Lake= In 1845 he was asked to pursue a band of marauding Native Americans led by an escaped neophyte from the San Gabriel Mission,Trafzer, Clifford. 2002. The People of San Manuel. San Manuel Band of Mission Indians. Patton, California who stole horses from the local ranchers. The Indians drove the horses, numbering in the thousands, up to the high desert near Lucerne. In his pursuit, Wilson sent 22 men through the Cajon Pass and led another 22 into the depths of the San Bernardino Mountains. According to Trafzer, the resident Serrano let Wilson pass through their territory in pursuit of the raiders. Wilson, later sent his 22 men in pairs on a bear hunt, gathering 11 pelts. On their return trip to Jurupa, they gathered another 11 pelts. He named the place Big Bear Lake. The lake today is known as Baldwin Lake, after Elias J. \\"Lucky\\" Baldwin, while the name Big Bear Lake was re-applied to a reservoir built nearby in 1884. =Political activities= In 1850, Wilson was elected to the Los Angeles Common Council,Chronological Record of Los Angeles City Officials,1850-1938, compiled under direction of Municipal Reference Library, City Hall, Los Angeles (March 1938, reprinted 1966). \\"Prepared ... as a report on Project No. SA 3123-5703-6077-8121-9900 conducted under the auspices of the Works Progress Administration.\\" and a year later he became the second elected mayor of Los Angeles after California was made a state. He also served as a Los Angeles County supervisor (1853, 1861-64). He was elected to three terms of the California State Senate. =Rancho San Pascual= In 1854 Wilson established Lake Vineyard, his own ranch and winery near modern-day San Gabriel, California. He came into possession of adjoining Rancho San Pascual (present day Pasadena) through a series of complicated land deals, which began with his lending money to the Rancho's owner Manuel Garfias in 1859. In 1863 Wilson and Dr. John Strother Griffin, who had also lent Garfias money — and with whom Wilson undertook many business deals in early Los Angeles, including railways, oil exploration, real estate, farming and ranching — bought the entire rancho property outright, and diverted water from the Arroyo Seco up to the dry mesa via an aqueduct called the \\"Wilson Ditch.\\" In 1864 Wilson took the first expedition to a high peak of the San Gabriel Mountains that would be named Mount Wilson. He hoped to harvest timber there for the making of wine vats, but he found the wood inadequate. The Wilson Trail became a popular one or two-day hike to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains by local residents for years to come. Wilson about 1850 In 1873, Wilson and Griffin subdivided their land (with Griffin getting almost 2/3 of the property, but Wilson retaining some better land (east of current Fair Oaks Avenue), near his Lake Vineyard property). Griffin then sold 2,500 acres (10 km) of his property to the \\"Indiana Colony,\\" represented by Daniel M. Berry. In 1876, after the Colony had sold most of its allotted land and established what would become the City of Pasadena, Wilson began subdividing and developing his adjacent landholdings which would become the eastern side of the new settlement. Legacy Wilson lived out his days in present-day San Gabriel. He gave several acres of property to his son-in-law James de Barth Shorb which he named San Marino. Other parts developed as Alhambra. Wilson's first wife died in 1849, after which time he married the widow Margaret Hereford. They would have four children of which one daughter Ruth would marry George Patton, Sr. and have a son who would become the World War II General George S. Patton, Jr. The Pattons would later purchase Lake Vineyard. Wilson died at the ranch in 1878 and was buried in San Gabriel Cemetery. The last of his land holdings in the downtown Pasadena area were bequeathed to Central School on South Fair Oaks Avenue. Mount Wilson, a metromedia center (television and radio transmission towers) for the greater Los Angeles area, is the most famous monument to Benjamin Wilson. Wilson Avenue in Pasadena and Don Benito School of the Pasadena Unified School District also honor his name. References =Bibliography= * . * *Google Bookshelf, The Pattons *Wilson, Benjamin D.

He is also the former joint-head and co-founder of the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and a Fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge. Education Born in Sussex, England, Ashburner attended High Wycombe Royal Grammar School from 1953 to 1960. He studied at Churchill College, Cambridge, and received his Bachelor of Arts in Natural Sciences Tripos (Genetics) in 1964, his PhD from the Department of Genetics in 1968, and was awarded a Doctor of Science in 1978. Research and career Most of Ashburner's research has been on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Ashburner's career began in the early period of molecular biology prior to the development of most of the recombinant DNA techniques in use today, such as Northern/Southern/Western blotting. Nevertheless, by observing patterns of \\"puffing\\" in polytene chromosomes, he established the existence of a cascade of genetic controls in the post-larval development triggered by ecdysone. The Ashburner model of 1974 became a paradigm for metazoan gene regulation inasmuch as the Jacob-Monod model did for prokaryotes. Ashburner collaborated widely and mentored numerous PhD students and Postdoctoral research students during his career. Ashburner was also a member of the consortium that eventually sequenced and annotated the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Ashburner's recollections of the sequencing of the D. melanogaster genome forms the basis of a book entitled \\"Won for All: How the Drosophila Genome Was Sequenced\\". A prolonged effort by his laboratory to characterise the Adh region became invaluable for validating annotation strategies when large-scale genome information became available. Ashburner and his colleagues have received funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) for their studies on Drosophila genomics leveraging the D. melanogaster genome and its annotation. =Computational biology= Ashburner was also an early pioneer in the application of computers to biology. His contributions include his active participation in setting up FlyBase and the development of Open Biomedical Ontologies to allow machine-searchable annotation of biological information, particularly the Gene Ontology and ChEBI. He was instrumental in establishing the EBI, as well as securing its location in the UK, and acted as the first head of the EBI jointly with Graham Cameron. =Open science advocacy= As part of his involvement the sequencing of the D. melanogaster genome, Ashburner played an instrumental role in ensuring that the resulting sequence and annotations would be made publicly available. Additionally, Ashburner made a strong case for the human genome published in Science in 2000 by Celera Genomics to be made freely available, and has spoken out repeatedly against the privatization of genomic resources. Ashburner was also one of the signatories of the first open letter to Science in 2001 calling for a centralized, open repository of the scientific literature, and subsequently became a strong advocate of Open Access publishing, speaking out for this cause in the scientific literature and popular media. He also provided written evidence to the UK Parliament Select Committee on Science and Technology supporting Open Access publishing and served on the initial advisory board of UK PubMed Central, the first global mirror site of the PubMed Central repository of freely available biological literature. =Awards and honours= Ashburner was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993. He received the Gregor Mendel Medal from the Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic in 1998, the first George W. Beadle Award of the Genetics Society of America in 1999, an honorary Doctorate from the University of Crete in 2002, an honorary Doctor of Science from the University of Edinburgh in 2003, the Genetics Society Medal of the UK Genetics Society in 2005 and the Franklin Award of the Bioinformatics Organization in 2006.

It was named after a northern region of Ethiopia, at the time part of Italian East Africa. Design and description The Adua-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding . They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of .Chesneau, pp. 309–10 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the Adua class had a range of at , submerged, they had a range of at .Bagnasco, p. 154 The boats were armed with six internal torpedo tubes, four in the bow and two in the stern. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of machine guns. Construction and career Scirè was launched on 6 January 1938 in OTO's shipyard in La Spezia and commissioned on 25 April 1938. At the beginning of the war, she was assigned to 15th Squadron (I Submarine Group) based at La Spezia and was under command of Adriano Pini. On July 10, 1940, while on patrol in the western Mediterranean, French cargo ship SS Cheik (1058 GRT) was torpedoed and sunk by Scirè 54nm from the Asmare Light, north of Sardinia. In the summer of 1940 Scirè underwent a series of modifications allowing her to carry SLC. The size of the tower was reduced, her deck gun was removed, and 3 watertight cylinders were mounted on her deck instead to accommodate maiali. These cylinders, each weighing 2.8 tons, could hold up depths down to 90 meters. On September 24, 1940 Scirè, under command of captain Junio Valerio Borghese, sailed from La Spezia for her first special mission to be performed in Gibraltar. In the evening of September 29, upon reaching the Strait of Gibraltar, Sciré received an order from Supermarina to suspend the mission and return to the base as Force H had left the Mediterranean to operate in the Atlantic. In 1940 Scire made its first foray into the Bay of Gibraltar with the intent of sabotaging the British ships in Gibraltar Harbour with three manned torpedoes. None of the three were successful with the most daring getting stuck 100 metres from . The crew were forced to withdraw and the explosion of the torpedo's only achievement was to tip off the defenders of Gibraltar Harbour. They organised for boats to drop small charges into the water each night that would have proved fatal to any diver in range of the shock wave. Scirè entered the Bay of Gibraltar again in September 1941 with better results than the previous time. On September 20, 1941 three tankers were attacked and Fiona Shell (2444 GRT, 1892) was sunk whilst other two ships, RFA Denbydale (2145 GRT) and MS Durham (10893 GRT) were damaged. The Italians decided to create a permanent base in Spain eventually converting a ship called that was moored off Algeciras into a permanent base for naval sabotage. Scirè accomplished many missions inside enemy waters. Among these, the most important was carried out on 3 December 1941. Scirè left La Spezia carrying three manned torpedoes. At the island of Leros in the Aegean Sea, it secretly loaded six crew for them: Luigi Durand de la Penne and Emilio Bianchi (maiale 221), Vincenzo Martellotta and Mario Marino (maiale 222), Antonio Marceglia and Spartaco Schergat (maiale 223). On 19 December, Scirè reached Alexandria in Egypt, and its manned torpedoes entered the harbour and sank in shallow waters the British battleships , Queen Elizabeth and damaged the tanker Sagona and the destroyer Jervis. All six torpedo-riders were captured and the battleships returned to service after several months of repairs. During a mission to launch manned torpedoes, on 10 August 1942, Scirè was depth charged by the British naval trawler in Haifa bay, about from the harbour. Scirè surfaced briefly before sinking during which time she was also shelled by 300 Coast Battery, Royal Artillery.300 Coast Bty War Diary, 1942, The National Archives, Kew, file WO 169/4674. Islay was captained by Lieutenant Commander John Clements Ross of North Shields, Tyne and Wear who was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. The wreck of Scirè, lying at a depth of , became a popular diving site and Shayetet 13 training location. In 1984 a joint Italian-Israeli Navy ceremony was performed, in which the forward section was removed from the submarine and sent to Italy to become part of a memorial.

It was created in the early 1960s as part of William Pereira's master plan for the Irvine Ranch. Newport Center was created as the unofficial \\"downtown\\" of the Irvine Ranch, which at the time extended all the way down to Pacific Coast Highway. History Satellite view of Newport Center, taken in 2005 It was the site used for the 1953 National Scout Jamboree of the Boy Scouts of America.Newport Beach 100 – Landmarks and Legends The event was held where Newport Center and Fashion Island now sit. It was the third international jamboree; the first jamboree held west of the Mississippi River and had with 50,000 scouts from all 48 states, Alaska, Hawaii, and 16 foreign countries.Orange County – 1946 to 1962 It was one of the first sites considered for Disneyland. During excavation of the site for the first buildings, a considerable amount of petrified wood was discovered, indicating that a small forest once existed in the area. The center was designed as part of a joint venture between Pereira and Welton Becket, with an emphasis on International Style architecture. The first building, at 400 Newport Center Drive, went up in 1967, with the majority of the center's buildings following in the 1970s. Although Newport Center's International Style design was mostly seen through to completion, Pereira broke his own rule by adding the futurist Pacific Mutual building in 1972, which became one of Newport Beach's most well-known architectural landmarks. Newport Center and Fashion Island were named by Orange County advertising pioneer Leland Oliver Co., Inc. which also created the advertising and public relations for many years. The strip of land between Avocado and MacArthur roads was originally slated to be an exit spur of the Pacific Coast Freeway, which was never built. It sat largely empty until the late 2000s when a library and park were constructed on the site. Economy The center occupies a large city block between Jamboree, MacArthur and San Joaquin Hills roads, and Pacific Coast Highway. In the center of this block is a circular road, called Newport Center Drive, with high-rise buildings encircling the outside edge of the road. Numerous businesses are located along Newport Center Drive, including insurer Pacific Life, PIMCO, Janus Capital Group, Acacia Research Corporation, Irvine Company, Blackwood, and law firm Stradling Yocca Carlson & Rauth. Fashion Island Main entrance to Newport Center and Fashion Island at intersection of Newport Center Drive and Highway 1 The center of the circle is occupied by Fashion Island regional shopping mall.

The culture is thought to be the result of a multiethnic cultural mix of the Sarmatian, Slavic, Gothic, and Geto-Dacian (including Romanised Daco-Romans) populations of the area. The Chernyakhov culture territorially replaced its predecessor, the Zarubintsy culture. Both cultures were discovered by the Czech-Ukrainian archaeologist, Vikentiy Khvoyka, who conducted numerous excavations around Kiev and its vicinity. Among other archaeologists are Austrian Karel Hadáček from Eastern Galicia and Ivan Kovac from Transylvania. With the invasion of Huns, the culture declined and was replaced with the Penkovka culture (or the culture of the Antes). The Chernyakhov culture is very similar to the Wielbark culture, which was located closer to the Baltic Sea.  Location and nomenclature  The Chernyakhov culture encompassed regions of modern Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania. It is named after the localities Sântana de Mureș, Mureș County, Transylvania in Romania and Cherniakhiv, Kaharlyk Raion, Kyiv Oblast in Ukraine. The dual name reflects past preferential use by different schools of history (Romanian and Soviet) to designate the culture. The spelling \\"Chernyakhov\\" is the transliteration from the Russian language. Other spellings include Marosszentanna (Hungarian), Sîntana de Mureș (pre-1993 Romanian spelling), Cherniakhiv (Ukrainian), Czerniachów (Polish), and several others. Origins =Archaeology, identity and ethnicity= The 'culture-historical' doctrine founded by German archaeologist Gustaf Kossinna, assumed that “sharply defined archaeological culture areas correspond unquestionably with the areas of particular peoples or tribes”.. Citing Scholars today are more inclined to see material cultures as cultural-economic systems incorporating many different groups. \\"What created the boundaries of these cultural areas were not the political frontiers of a particular people, but the geographical limits within which the population groups interacted with sufficient intensity to make some or all of the remains of their physical culture – pottery, metal work, building styles, burial goods and so on- look very similar. > Kossinna's Siedlungsarchäologie ('settlement archaeology') postulated that > materially homogeneous archeological cultures could be matched with the > ethnic groups defined by philologists. — Michael Kulikowski, Rome's Gothic Wars, p. 61 Essentially, scholars are tentative in ascribing an 'ethnic' identity to the material remains of past populations, although they recognise that certain objects may have been manipulated to represent some form of group identity, especially at times of inter-group conflict. =Early 20th century views= In the earlier half of the 20th century, scholars spent much energy debating the ethnic affinity of people in the Chernyakov zone. Soviet scholars, such as Boris Rybakov, saw it as the archaeological reflection of the Proto-Slavs, but western, especially German, historians, and Polish archeologists attributed it to the Goths. According to Kazimierz Godłowski (1979), the origins of Slavic culture should be connected with the areas of the upper Dnieper basin (the Kiev culture) while the Chernyakhov culture with the federation of the Goths. However, the remains of archaeologically visible material culture and their link with ethnic identity are not as clear as originally thought. The migration theory from Scandinavia to the Polish Baltic coast regions and further on to Ukraine was ideal propaganda material for German Nazi Ostsiedlung ideology and arguments for Lebensraum. Reference material used during that era was Ludwig Schmidt's Geschichte der deutschen Stämme (History of the German Tribes) =Modern research= Today, scholars recognize the Chernyakov zone as representing a cultural interaction of a diversity of peoples, but predominantly those who already existed in the region, whether it be the Sarmatians, or the Getae-Dacians (some authors believe that the Getae-Dacians played the leading role in the creation of the culture). Late Antiquity authors often confused the Getae with the Goths, most notably Jordanes, in his Getica. Finds =Funerary rites= Both inhumation and cremation were practiced. The dead were buried with grave goods – pottery, iron implements, bone combs, personal ornaments, although in later periods grave goods decrease. Of the inhumation burials, the dead were usually buried in a north–south axis (with head to north), although a minority are in east–west orientation. Funerary gifts often include fibulae, belt buckles, bone combs, glass drinking vessels and other jewelry. Women's burials in particular shared very close similarities with Wielbark forms - buried with two fibulae, one on each shoulder. Like in the Wielbark culture, Chernyakhov burials usually lack weapons as funerary gifts, except in a few cremation burials reminiscent of Przeworsk influences. Although cremation burials are traditionally associated with Dacian, Germanic and Slavic peoples, and inhumation is suggestive of nomadic practice, careful analysis suggests that the mixed burials were of an earlier period, whilst toward the end there was a trend toward inhumation burials without grave goods. This could be the result of the influences of Christianity, but could just as easily be explained in terms of an evolution of non-Christian beliefs about the afterlife. =Ceramic wares= Finds from the Budeşti Necropolis in Raionul Criuleni, Moldova, 3rd/4th centuries. Pottery was predominantly of local production, being both wheel and hand-made. Wheel made pottery predominated, and was made of finer clay. It was reminiscent of earlier Sarmatian types, refined by Roman and La Tene influences. Hand made pottery showed a greater variety in form, and was sometimes decorated with incised linear motifs. In addition, Roman amphorae are also found, suggesting trade contacts with the Roman world. There is also a small, but regular, presence of distinct hand–made pottery typical of that found in western Germanic groups, suggesting the presence of Germanic groups. =Economy= The Chernyakhov people were primarily a settled population involved in cultivation of cereals – especially wheat, barley and millet. Finds of ploughshares, sickles and scythes have been frequent. Cattle breeding was the primary mode of animal husbandry, and the breeding of horses appears to have been restricted to the open steppe. Metalworking skills were widespread throughout the culture, and local smiths produced much of the implements, although there is some evidence of production specialization. =Decline= The Chernyakhov culture ends in the 5th century, attributed to the arrival of the Huns. The collapse of the culture is no longer explained in terms of population displacement, although there was an outmigration of Goths. Rather, more recent theories explain the collapse of the Chernyakhov culture in terms of a disruption of the hierarchical political structure that maintained it. John Mathews suggests that, despite its cultural homogeneity, a sense of ethnic distinction was kept between the disparate peoples. Some of the autochthonous elements persist, and become even more widespread, after the demise of the Gothic elite – a phenomenon associated with the rise and expansion of the early Slavs. Migration and diffusion theories =Migration= Whilst acknowledging the mixed origins of the Chernyakiv culture, Peter Heather suggests that the culture is ultimately a reflection of the Goths' domination of the Pontic area. He cites literary sources that attest that the Goths were the centre of political attention at this time. In particular, the culture's development corresponds well with Jordanes' tale of Gothic migration from Gothiscandza to Oium, under the leadership of Filimer. Moreover, he highlights that crucial external influences that catalysed Chernyakhov cultural development derived from the Wielbark culture. Originating in the mid-1st century, it spread from south of the Baltic Sea (from territory around later Pomerania) down the Vistula in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Wielbark elements are prominent in the Chernyakhov zone, such as typical 'Germanic' pottery, brooch types and female costume, and, in particular, weaponless bi-ritual burials. Although cultures may spread without substantial population movements, Heather draws attention to a decrease in the number of settlements in the original Pomeranian Wielbark heartland as evidence of a significant population movement. Combined with Jordanes' account, Heather concludes that a movement of Goths (and other east Germanic groups such as Heruli and Gepids) \\"played a major role in the creation of the Cernjachove culture\\". He clarifies that this movement was not a single, royal- led, migration, but was rather accomplished by a series of small, sometimes mutually antagonistic groups. =Diffusion= However, Guy Halsall challenges some of Heather's conclusions. He sees no chronological development from the Wielbark to Chernyakhov culture, given that the latter stage of the Wielbark culture is synchronous with Chernyakhov, and the two regions have minimal territorial overlap. \\"Although it is often claimed that Cernjachov metalwork derives from Wielbark types, close examination reveals no more than a few types with general similarities to Wielbark types\\". Michael Kulikowski also challenges the Wielbark connection, highlighting that the greatest reason for Wielbark-Chernyakhov connection derives from a \\"negative characteristic\\" (i.e., the absence of weapons in burials), which is less convincing proof than a positive one. He argues that the Chernyakhov culture could just as likely have been an indigenous development of local Pontic, Carpic or Dacian cultures, or a blended culture resulting from Przeworsk and steppe interactions. Furthermore, he altogether denies the existence of Goths prior to the 3rd century. Kulikowski states that no Gothic people, nor even a noble kernel, migrated from Scandinavia or the Baltic. Rather, he suggests that the \\"Goths\\" formed in situ. Like the Alemanni or the Franks, the Goths were a \\"product of the Roman frontier\\". Other influences, such as a minority of burials containing weapons, are seen from the Przeworsk and Zarubinec cultures. The latter has been connected with early Slavs. Genetics In 2019, a genetic study of various cultures of the Eurasian Steppe, including the Chernyakhov culture, was published in Current Biology. Samples from three individuals thought to belong its Gothic component were analyzed. Compared to earlier samples from the region, attributed to Scythians and Sarmatians, the results appeared to confirm that the Chernyakhov culture emerged partly as a result of a new non-Scythian population, with a higher amount of Near Eastern ancestry. These results appeared to confirm the theory that the Chernyakhov culture emerged as a result of migrations from the direction of central Europe.

E. B. Du Bois. It is a seminal work in the history of sociology and a cornerstone of African-American literature. The book contains several essays on race, some of which had been published earlier in The Atlantic Monthly. To develop this work, Du Bois drew from his own experiences as an African American in American society. Outside of its notable relevance in African-American history, The Souls of Black Folk also holds an important place in social science as one of the early works in the field of sociology. In The Souls of Black Folk, Du Bois used the term \\"double consciousness\\", perhaps taken from Ralph Waldo Emerson (\\"The Transcendentalist\\" and \\"Fate\\"), applying it to the idea that black people must have two fields of vision at all times. They must be conscious of how they view themselves, as well as being conscious of how the world views them. Chapters Each chapter in The Souls of Black Folk begins with a pair of epigraphs: text from a poem, usually by a European poet, and the musical score of a spiritual, which Du Bois describes in his foreword (\\"The Forethought\\") as \\"some echo of haunting melody from the only American music which welled up from black souls in the dark past\\". Columbia University English and comparative literature professor Brent Hayes Edwards writes: > It is crucial to recognize that Du Bois ... chooses not to include the > lyrics to the spirituals, which often serve to underline the arguments of > the chapters: Booker T. Washington's idealism is echoed in the otherworldly > salvation hoped for in \\"A Great Camp-Meeting in the Promised Land\\", for > example; likewise the determined call for education in \\"Of the Training of > Black Men\\" is matched by the strident words of \\"March On\\". Edwards adds that Du Bois may have withheld the lyrics to mark a barrier for the reader, to suggest that black culture—life \\"within the veil\\"—remains inaccessible to white people. In \\"The Forethought\\", Du Bois states: > \\"Leaving, then, the world of the white man, I have stepped within the Veil, > raising it that you may view faintly its deeper recesses,—the meaning of its > religion, the passion of its human sorrow, and the struggle of its greater > souls.\\" He concludes with the words: \\"...need I add that I who speak here am > bone of the bone and flesh of the flesh of them that live within the Veil?\\" = \\"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\\" = Chapter I, \\"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\\", lays out an overview of Du Bois's thesis. He says that the blacks of the South need the right to vote, the right to a good education, and to be treated with equality and justice. Here, he also coined \\"double-consciousness\\", defined as a \\"sense of always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.\\"Du Bois, W. E. B. The Souls of Black Folk. 1903.\\"Chap. I: Of Our Spiritual Strivings\\", at Bartleby.com > \\"One ever feels his twoness,—an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, > two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose > dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder. The History of the > American Negro is the history of this strive-this longing to attain self- > conscious manhood, to merge his double self into a better and truer self. He > simply wishes to make it possible for a man to be both a Negro and an > American, without being cursed and spit upon by his fellows, without having > the doors of Opportunity closed roughly in his face.\\" The first chapter also introduces Du Bois's famous metaphor of the veil. According to Du Bois, this veil is worn by all African-Americans because their view of the world and its potential economic, political, and social opportunities are so vastly different from those of white people. The veil is a visual manifestation of the color line, a problem Du Bois worked his whole life to remedy. Du Bois sublimates the function of the veil when he refers to it as a gift of second sight for African Americans, thus simultaneously characterizing the veil as both a blessing and a curse. > \\"In those sombre forests of his striving his own soul rose before him, and > he saw himself,-darkly as through a veil; and yet he saw in himself some > faint revelation of his power, of his mission.\\" = \\"Of the Dawn of Freedom\\" = The second chapter, \\"Of the Dawn of Freedom\\", covers the period of history from 1861 to 1872 and the Freedmen's Bureau. Du Bois also introduces the problem of the color-line. > \\"The Problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color-line,—the > relation of the darker to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in > America and the islands of the sea. Du Bois describes the Freedmen's Bureau as \\"one of the most singular and interesting of the attempts made by a great nation to grapple with vast problems of race and social condition.\\" He says that the bureau was \\"one of the great landmarks of political and social progress.\\" After a year's work, Du Bois states that \\"it relieved a vast amount of physical suffering; it transported seven thousand fugitives from congested centres back to the farm; and, best of all, it inaugurated the crusade of the New England school-ma'am.\\" > \\"The greatest success of the Freedmen's Bureau lay in the planting of the > free school among Negroes, and the idea of free elementary education among > all classes in the South.\\" He gives credit to the creation of Fisk University, Clark Atlanta University, Howard University, and Hampton University and acknowledges the \\"apostles of human culture\\" Edmund Asa Ware, Samuel C. Armstrong, and Erastus Cravath. He worried that the demise of the Freedman's Savings Bank, which resulted in huge losses for many freedmen of any savings, resulted in freedmen losing \\"all the faith in savings\\". Finally, he argues that \\"if we cannot peacefully reconstruct the South with white votes, we certainly can with black votes.\\" > \\"...the granting of the ballot to the black man was a necessity, the very > least a guilty nation could grant a wronged race, and the only method of > compelling the South to accept the results of the war. Thus Negro suffrage > ended a civil war by beginning a race feud.\\" = \\"Of Mr. Booker T. Washington and Others\\" = Chapters III and VI deal with education and progress. Here Du Bois argues against Booker T. Washington's idea of focusing solely on industrial education for black men. He advocates the addition of a classical education to establish leaders and educators in the black community. Du Bois refers to the Atlanta Compromise as the \\"most notable of Mr. Washington's career,\\" and \\"the old attitude of adjustment and submission.\\" Du Bois claims that Washington wants black people to give up three things: political power, insistence on civil rights, and higher education. He fears that, if black people \\"concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South,\\" this will lead to 1) The disenfranchisement of the Negro, 2) The legal creation of a distinct status of civil inferiority for the Negro, and 3) The steady withdrawal of aid from institutions for the higher training of the Negro.\\" By Washington focusing on \\"common-school and industrial training,\\" he \\"depreciates institutions of higher learning,\\" where \\"teachers, professional men, and leaders\\" are trained. > \\"But so far as Mr. Washington apologizes for injustice, North or South, does > not rightly value the privilege and duty of voting, opposes the higher > training and ambition of our brighter minds,—so far as he, the South, or the > Nation, does this,—we must unceasingly and firmly oppose them.\\" Note: By the time Du Bois published his book, most of the former Confederate states had completed disenfranchisement of blacks, led by Mississippi in 1890, by constitutional amendments and other laws raising barriers to voter registration, primarily through poll taxes, residency and recordkeeping requirements, subjective literacy tests and other devices. Virginia passed similar laws in 1908. By excluding blacks from political life, southern legislatures were able to pass Jim Crow laws and other discriminatory methods. = \\"Of the Meaning of Progress\\" = In the fourth chapter, \\"Of the Meaning of Progress\\", Du Bois explores his experiences first, when he was teaching in Tennessee. Secondly he returned after 10 years and found the town where he had worked had suffered many unpleasant changes. He says: \\"My log schoolhouse was gone. In its place stood Progress; and Progress, I understand, is necessarily ugly.\\" > \\"I was a Fisk student then, and all Fisk men thought that Tennessee-beyond > the Veil- was theirs alone, and in vacation time they sallied forth in lusty > bands to meet the county school-commissioners.\\" Yet, he states, after meeting with the commissioner, \\"but even then fell the awful shadow of the Veil, for they ate first, then I-alone.\\" > \\"I have called my tiny community a world, and so its isolation made it; and > yet there was among us but a half-awakened common consciousness, sprung from > common joy and grief, at burial, birth, or wedding; from a common hardship > in poverty, poor land, and low wages; and, above all, from the sight of the > Veil that hung between us and Opportunity.\\" = \\"Of the Wings of Atlanta\\" = The fifth chapter is a meditation on the necessity of widespread higher education in the South. Du Bois compares Atlanta, the City of a Hundred Hills, to Atalanta, and warns against the \\"greed of gold,\\" or \\"interpreting the world in dollars.\\" The \\"Black World beyond the Veil\\", should not succumb \\"Truth, Beauty, and Goodness,\\" to the ideal of wealth attainment in public schools. > \\"...beyond the Veil are smaller but like problems of ideals, of leaders and > the led, of serfdom, of poverty, of order and subordination, and, through > all, the Veil of Race.\\" He admonishes readers to \\"Teach workers to work, and Teach thinkers to think.\\" \\"The need of the South is knowledge and culture,\\" he says: > \\"And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of > living,—not sordid money-getting, not apples of gold.\\" = \\"Of the Training of Black Men\\" = Du Bois discusses how \\"to solve the problem of training men for life,\\" especially as it relates to the Negro, who \\"hang between them and a light a veil so thick, that they shall not even think of breaking through.\\" Du Bois cites the progress of Southern education, consisting of army schools, mission schools, and schools of the Freedman's Bureau, from the end of the Civil War until 1876. Then complete school systems were established including Normal schools and colleges, followed by the industrial revolution in the South from 1885 to 1895, and its industrial schools. Yet, he asks, \\"Is Not life more than meat, and the body more than raiment?\\" Du Bois asserts: \\"...education that encourages aspiration, that sets the loftiest of ideals and seeks as an end culture and character rather than bread-winning,\\" is the right of the black as well as the white. He goes on to state, \\"If the Negro was to learn, he must teach himself,\\" and cites the 30,000 black teachers created in one generation who \\"wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of the black people of the land, and they made Tuskegee possible.\\" Additionally, 2500 Negroes had received a bachelor's degree, of whom 53% became teachers or leaders of educational systems, 17% became clergymen, 17% mainly physicians, 6% merchants, farmers and artisans; and 4% in government service. From 1875 to 1880, there were 22 Negro graduates from Northern colleges and 143 from Southern Negro colleges. From 1895 to 1900, Northern colleges graduated 100 Negros and over 500 graduated from Southern Negro colleges. Du Bois concludes by stating that the \\"...inevitable problems of civilization the Negro must meet and solve largely for himself.\\" > \\"The function of the Negro college, then, is clear: it must maintain the > standards of popular education, it must seek the social regeneration of the > Negro, and it must help in the solution of problems of race contact and co- > operation. And finally, beyond all this, it must develop men.\\" = \\"Of the Black Belt\\" = Du Bois calls Albany, Georgia, in Dougherty County, the \\"heart of the Black Belt.\\" He says: \\"Here are the remnants of the vast plantations.\\" > \\"How curious a land is this,- how full of untold story, of tragedy and > laughter, and the rich legacy of human life; shadowed with a tragic past, > and big with future promise!\\" Yet, he notes, it is not far from \\"where Sam Hose was crucified\\" [in a lynching], \\"to-day the centre of the Negro problem,-the centre of those nine million men who are America's dark heritage from slavery and the slave-trade.\\" He continues: \\"Careless ignorance and laziness here, fierce hate and vindictiveness there,—these are the extremes of the Negro problem which we met that day, and we scarce knew which we preferred.\\" = \\"Of the Quest of the Golden Fleece\\" = Speaking of the cotton fields from \\"Carolina to Texas\\", Du Bois claims an analogy between the \\"ancient and modern \\"Quest of the Golden Fleece in the Black Sea.\\" Continuing his discussion of Dougherty County, he explains that of the 1500 Negro families around Albany in 1898, many families have 8–10 individuals in one- or two-room homes. These families are plagued with \\"easy marriage and easy separation,\\" a vestige of slavery, which the Negro church has done much to prevent \\"a broken household.\\" He claims that most of the black population is \\"poor and ignorant,\\" more than 80 percent, though \\"fairly honest and well meaning.\\" \\"Two-thirds of them cannot read or write,\\" and 80 percent of the men, women and children are farmers. Economically, the Negro has become a slave of debt, says Du Bois. He describes the economic classes: the \\"submerged tenth\\" of croppers, 40 percent are metayers or \\"tenant on shares\\" with a chattel mortgage, 39 percent are semi- metayers and wage-laborers, while 5 percent are money-renters, and 6 percent freeholders. Finally, du Bois states that only 6 percent \\"have succeeded in emerging into peasant proprietorship\\", leading to a \\"migration to town\\", the \\"buying of small homesteads near town\\". = \\"Of the Sons of Master and Man\\" = This chapter discusses \\"race-contact\\", specifically as it relates to physical proximity, economic and political relations, intellectual contact, social contact, and religious enterprise. As for physical proximity, Du Bois states there is an obvious \\"physical color-line\\" in Southern communities separating whites from Negroes, and a Black Belt in larger areas of the country. He says that here is a need for \\"Negro leaders of character and intelligence\\" to help guide Negro communities along the path out of the current economic situation. The power of the ballot is necessary, he asserts, as \\"in every state the best arbiters of their own welfare are the persons directly affected.\\" He says that \\"the police system of the South was primarily designed to control slaves,\\" and Negroes viewed its \\"courts as a means of reenslaving the blacks.\\" Regarding social contact, Du Bois states \\"there is almost no community of intellectual life or point of transference where the thoughts and feelings of one race can come into direct contact and sympathy with thoughts and feelings of the other.\\" He concludes that \\"the future of the South depends on the ability of the representatives of these opposing views to see and appreciate and sympathize with each other's position.\\" = \\"Of the Faith of the Fathers\\" = In Chapter X, Du Bois describes the rise of the black church and examines the history and contemporary state of religion and spiritualism among African Americans. After recounting his first exposure to the Southern Negro revival, Du Bois notes three things that characterize this religion: the Preacher, the Music, and the Frenzy—the Frenzy or Shouting being \\"when the Spirit of the Lord passed by, and, seizing the devotee, made him mad with supernatural joy.\\" Du Bois says that the Negro church is the social center of Negro life. Predominately Methodists or Baptists after Emancipation, when Emancipation finally, came Du Bois states, it seemed to the freedman a literal \\"Coming of the Lord\\". = \\"Of the Passing of the First-Born\\" = The final chapters of the book are devoted to narratives of individuals. In Chapter XI, \\"Of the Passing of the First-Born\\", Du Bois recounts the birth of his first child, a son, and his untimely death as an infant. His son, Burghardt, contracted diphtheria and white doctors in Atlanta refused to treat black patients. Du Bois comments, \\"Why was his hair tinted with gold? An evil omen was golden hair in my life.\\" He says, \\"I saw his breath beat quicker and quicker, pause, and then his little soul leapt like a star that travels in the night and left a world of darkness in its train. Du Bois ends with, \\"Sleep, then, child,—sleep till I sleep and waken to a baby voice and the ceaseless patter of little feet-above the Veil.\\" = \\"Of Alexander Crummell\\" = In this chapter, Du Bois recounts a short biography of Alexander Crummell, an early black priest in the Episcopal Church. Du Bois starts with, \\"This is the history of a human heart.\\" He notes that Crummell faced three temptations: those of Hate, Despair, and Doubt,\\" while crossing two vales, the Valley of Humiliation and the Valley of the Shadow of Death.\\" Du Bois ends with, \\"And now that he is gone, I sweep the Veil away and cry, Lo! the soul to whose dear memory I bring this little tribute.\\" = \\"Of the Coming of John\\" = The penultimate chapter, \\"Of the Coming of John\\", is fictional. Du Bois tells about John, an African American from Altamaha, Georgia, who is sent to a good school. When he returns to his place, he discovers that \\"[l]ittle had they understood of what he said, for he spoke an unknown tongue\\" (Du Bois 170). John's return to the South has made him a foreigner in his own home. After he attempts to teach a class for the local children, John is compared to a different John, the son of wealthy Judge Henderson. John Henderson has become bored after his own return from college. He begins to sexually assault Jennie, the sister of black John, when the young white man sees her outside his home. John kills white John and bids his mother goodbye. In the final part of the story, there is an implication that he is about to be lynched by a gathering mob, and John \\"softly hum[s] the 'Song of the Bride in German. (Du Bois 176). = \\"The Sorrow Songs\\" = Chapter XIV, \\"The Sorrow Songs\\", is about Negro music. He refers to the short musical passages at the beginning of each of the other chapters. Du Bois mentions that the music was so powerful and meaningful that, regardless of the people's appearance and teaching, \\"their hearts were human and their singing stirred men with a mighty power.\\" Du Bois concludes the chapter by bringing up inequality, race and discrimination. He says, \\"Your country? How came it yours?..we were here\\".Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. The Souls of Black Folk. 1903. Du Bois heralds the \\"melody of the slave songs\\", or the Negro spirituals, as the \\"articulate message of the slave to the world.\\" They are the music, he contends, not of the joyous black slave, as a good many whites had misread them, but \\"of an unhappy people, of the children of disappointment; they tell of death and suffering and unvoiced longing toward a truer world, of misty wanderings and hidden ways.\\" For Du Bois, the sorrow songs represented a black folk culture—with its origins in slavery—unadulterated by the civilizing impulses of a northern black church, increasingly obsessed with respectability and with Western aesthetic criteria. Rather than vestiges of a backward time that should be purged from black repertoires and isolated from what Alain Locke called the \\"modernization of the negro\\" (coincident, for Locke, with urbanization), negro spirituals are—for Du Bois—where the souls of black folk past and present are found. Du Bois passionately advocated for the preservation of the spiritual, along with Antonín Dvořák and contemporary black aestheticians, including Harry Burleigh, Robert Nathaniel Dett, Alain Locke and Zora Neale Hurston. It is in the retrieval of black cultural folkways—particularly \\"The Sorrow Songs\\"—that one of the major complications of Du Bois's project and, later, the Harlem Renaissance (where Hurston and Locke debut their own retrievals) surfaces. For Du Bois's contention that the sorrow songs contain a notative excess, and untranscribable element Yolanda Pierce identifies as the \\"soul\\" of the sorrow songs. The mappings of sound and signs that make up the languages of white Western culture would prove insufficient to many black literary critics of the 1920s and beyond, and the debates over the abilities to retrieve and preserve black folkways find their roots in Du Bois's treatment of the sorrow songs and in his call for their rescue. Critical reception In Living Black History, Du Bois's biographer Manning Marable observes: > Few books make history and fewer still become foundational texts for the > movements and struggles of an entire people. The Souls of Black Folk > occupies this rare position. It helped to create the intellectual argument > for the black freedom struggle in the twentieth century. \\"Souls\\" justified > the pursuit of higher education for Negroes and thus contributed to the rise > of the black middle class. By describing a global color-line, Du Bois > anticipated pan-Africanism and colonial revolutions in the Third World. > Moreover, this stunning critique of how 'race' is lived through the normal > aspects of daily life is central to what would become known as 'whiteness > studies' a century later.Marable, Manning (2011), Living Black History: How > Reimagining the African-American Past Can Remake America's Racial Future, p. > 96. . At the time of its publication, the Nashville Banner warned of The Souls of Black Folk, \\"This book is dangerous for the Negro to read, for it will only incite discontent and fill his imagination with things that do not exist, or things that should not bear upon his mind.\\" The New York Times said, \\"A review of [the work of the Freedmen's Bureau] from the negro point of view, even the Northern negro's point of view, must have its value to any unprejudiced student—still more, perhaps, for the prejudiced who is yet willing to be a student.\\" In his introduction to the 1961 edition, writer Saunders Redding observed, \\"The boycott of the buses in Montgomery had many roots . . . but none more important than this little book of essays published more than half a century ago.\\" = Literary reception = As Yale professor Hazel Carby points out, for black writers before the abolition of slavery in 1865, it was impossible \\"even to imagine the option of returning to the South once black humanity and freedom had been gained in the North\\", and it was rarely found in later literature as well.Carby, Hazel V. Race Men. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. p. 16. While the narratives of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Ann Jacobs move towards the North and freedom, Du Bois reverses \\"the direction of the archetypal journey of these original narratives\\" and focuses on the Black Belt of the South. Although the text \\"consistently shifts between a predominantly white and a predominantly black world\\", in line with Du Bois's concept of double consciousness, \\"its overall narrative impulse gradually moves the focus from a white terrain to an autonomous black one.\\"Carby, Race Men, 1998. p. 17. Carby traces the ways in which Du Bois gendered his narrative of black folk, but also how Du Bois's conceptual framework is gendered as well. According to Carby, it seems that Du Bois in this book is most concerned with how race and nation intersect, and how such an intersection is based on particular masculine notions of progress. According to Carby, Du Bois \\"exposes and exploits the tension that exists between the internal egalitarianism of the nation and the relations of domination and subordination embodied in a racially encoded social hierarchy.\\" So Du Bois makes a conceptual argument that racialization is actually compatible with the nation in so far as it creates unified races. However, this unified race is only possible through the gendered narrative that he constructs throughout Souls, which renders black male intellectuals (himself) as the (only possible) leader(s) of the unified race. Carby explains that \\"in order to retain his credentials for leadership, Du Bois had to situate himself as both an exceptional and a representative individual.... The terms and conditions of his exceptionalism, Du Bois argues, have their source in his formation as a gendered intellectual.\\"Carby, Race Men, 1998. pp. 30–31. According to Carby, Du Bois was concerned with \\"the reproduction of Race Men\\". In other words, \\"the figure of the intellectual and race leader is born of and engendered by other males.\\"Carby, Hazel V. Race Men. Cambridge, MA, London: Harvard University Press, 1998. pp. 25–26. Such a reading of Du Bois calls attention to \\"queer meanings\\" that, according to Charles Nero, are inherent in Souls. Nero, who uses Anne Herrmann's definition of queer, conceptualizes queerness as the \\"recognition on the part of others that one is not like others, a subject out of order, not in sequence, not working.\\" Foundational to Nero's argument is the understanding that men have the authority to exchange women among one another in order to form a \\"homosocial contract\\". Nero analyzes Du Bois's discussion on the Teutonic and Submissive Man to conclude that such a contract would lead to a \\"round and full development\\" to produce a \\"great civilization\\". However, Nero is concerned with violence and the \\"rigid policing of sexual identity categories at the turn of the century\\", which ultimately made such a homosocial, biracial contract impossible. Nero marks \\"Of the Coming of John\\" as a central chapter that demonstrates his queer reading of Souls. Nero argues that John Jones's absence of masculinity is a sign of his queerness and that the killing of his \\"double\\" represents Du Bois's disillusionment with the idea that a biracial and homosocial society can exist.Nero, Charles, \\"Queering the Souls of Black Folk,\\" Public Cultures 17, no. 2 (2005). = Cultural and religious criticism = Du Bois had transdisciplinary training and he provided a historical context for black religion and culture. His concept of \\"double-consciousness\\" and other concepts from Souls have been highly influential on other scholars in their interpretations of black culture and religion. Cheryl Sanders, a professor of Christian ethics at Howard University School of Divinity, lists a \\"who's who\\" of Du Bois progeny in her scholarly work, including Paul Gilroy, C. Eric Lincoln, Lawrence Mamiya, Peter Paris, Emilie Townes and Cornel West. These are some of the scholars who take up themes or concepts found in Souls for their own work in religious and theological studies or cultural criticism. Additionally, Victor Anderson, a philosophical theologian and cultural critic at Vanderbilt University Divinity School and the author of Beyond Ontological Blackness: An Essay on African American Religious and Cultural Criticism, links concepts from Souls to much of the work in black religious studies. In Beyond Ontological Blackness, Victor Anderson seeks to critique a trope of \\"black heroic genius\\" articulated within the logics of ontological blackness as a philosophy of racial consciousness. At the center of this conception is Du Bois. Anderson says, > \\"W. E. B. Du Bois's double-consciousness depiction of black existence has > come to epitomize the existential determinants of black self-consciousness. > These alienated forms of black consciousness have been categorically defined > in African-American cultural studies as: The Negro Problem, The Color Line, > Black Experience, Black Power, The Veil of Blackness, Black Radicalism, and > most recently, The Black Sacred Cosmos.\\" Anderson's critique of black heroic genius and a move towards black cultural fulfillment is an attempt to move beyond the categories deployed by Du Bois in Souls. Similarly, Sanders critiques Du Bois's concept of double-consciousness, especially in terms of interpreting black holiness-Pentecostalism. In Sanders's work, Saints in Exile: The Holiness-Pentecostal Experience in African American Religion and Culture, Sanders deploys a dialectical understanding of exile, which she characterizes in black holiness-Pentecostal terms as \\"Being in the world, but not of it.\\" At the same time, Sanders wishes to contrast this to the double-consciousness dialect of Du Bois, at least as she understands it. For Sanders, \\"exilic dialectics\\" is \\"hoped to represent a progressive step beyond the 'double-consciousness' described by W. E. B. Du Bois in 1903, which persists as the dominant paradigm in African American religious and cultural thought.\\" Describing exilic consciousness as between \\"both-and\\", and double-consciousness as \\"either-or\\", Sanders says that those who live in exile \\"can find equilibrium and fulfillment between extremes, whereas adherents to the latter either demand resolution or suffer greatly in the tension, as is the case with Du Bois's description of the agony of 'double-consciousness,' as 'two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.'\\" Textual changes In 1953, The Souls of Black Folk was published in a special \\"Fiftieth Anniversary Jubilee Edition\\". In his introduction, Du Bois wrote that in the 50 years since its publication, he occasionally had the inclination to revise the book but ultimately decided to leave it as it was, \\"as a monument to what I thought and felt in 1903\\". While he stuck by his decision, he wrote that in the new edition he had made \\"less than a half-dozen alterations in word or phrase and then not to change my thoughts as previously set down but to avoid any possible misunderstanding today of what I meant to say yesterday.\\" In 1973, historian Herbert Aptheker identified seven changes between the editions. Historian and literary critic Henry Louis Gates Jr. and a team of readers performed a line-by-line comparison of the two editions during the 1980s and identified two more changes. All the changes are minor; the longest was to change \\"nephews and poor whites and the Jews\\" to \\"poor relations and foreign immigrants\\". In six of the nine changes, Du Bois changed references to Jews to refer to immigrants or foreigners. Two of the other changes also involved references to Jews. Du Bois wrote to Aptheker in February 1953 about concerns he had with his references to Jews in the book: > I have had a chance to read [The Souls of Black Folk] in part for the first > time in years. I find in chapters VII, VII and IX, five incidental > references to Jews. I recall that years ago, Jacob Schiff wrote me > criticising these references and that I denied any thought of race or > religious prejudice and promised to go over the passages in future editions. > These editions succeeded each other without any consultation with me, and > evidently the matter slipped out of my mind. > As I re-read these words today, I see that harm might come if they were > allowed to stand as they are. First of all, I am not at all sure that the > foreign exploiters to whom I referred ... were in fact Jews.... But even if > they were, what I was condemning was the exploitation and not the race nor > religion. And I did not, when writing, realize that by stressing the name of > the group instead of what some members of the [group] may have done, I was > unjustly maligning a people in exactly the same way my folk were then and > are now falsely accused. > In view of this and because of the even greater danger of injustice now than > then, I want in the event of re-publication [to] change those passages., > cited in In a March 1953 letter to Blue Heron Press, Du Bois asked that the following paragraph be added to the end of \\"Of the Black Belt\\": > In the foregoing chapter, \\"Jews\\" have been mentioned five times, and the > late Jacob Schiff once complained that this gave an impression of anti- > Semitism. This at the time I stoutly denied; but as I read the passages > again in the light of subsequent history, I see how I laid myself open to > this possible misapprehension. What, of course, I meant to condemn was the > exploitation of black labor and that it was in this country and at that time > in part a matter of immigrant Jews, was incidental and not essential. My > inner sympathy with the Jewish people was expressed better in the last > paragraph of page 152. But this illustrates how easily one slips into > unconscious condemnation of a whole group., cited in The publisher did not add the paragraph, perhaps because Du Bois changed the text instead.

To their WebCT courses, instructors can add such tools as discussion boards, mail systems, and live chat, along with content including documents and web pages. The latest versions of this software are now called Webcourses. WebCT is significant in that it was the world's first widely successful course management system for higher education. At its height, it was in use by over 10 million students in 80 countries. Background WebCT was originally developed at the University of British Columbia by a faculty member in computer science, Murray Goldberg. Goldberg is also the creator of Silicon Chalk (sold to WimbaHorizon Wimba Acquires Silicon Chalk (website)), Brainify (website), and Marine Learning Systems (website). In 1995, Goldberg began looking at the application of web-based systems to education.UBC Computer Scientist Wins $100,000 Award for Popular Course Software, University of British Columbia News & Events, September 29, 2004 His research showed that student satisfaction and academic performance could be improved through the use of a web-based educational resource, or web-based course tools (from which the name WebCT is derived).{Goldberg, M., Salari, S. & Swoboda, P. (1996) ‘World Wide Web – Course Tool: An Environment for Building WWW-Based Courses’ Computer Networks and ISDN Systems, 28:7-11 pp1219-1231} In order to continue his research, he decided to build a system to ease the creation of web-based learning environments. This led to the first version of WebCT in early 1996, first presented at the 5th international World Wide Web conference in Paris during the spring of 1996. In 1997, Goldberg created a company, WebCT Educational Technologies Corporation, a spinoff company of UBC. Goldberg grew the company until 1999, at which point it served approximately 2-3 million students in 30 countries. In mid-1999, WebCT was acquired by ULT (Universal Learning Technology),Universal Learning Technology Acquires WebCT, Business Wire, May 17, 1999 a Boston-based company headed by Carol Vallone. Ms. Vallone continued to grow the company to the point where its product was used by over 10 million students in 80 countries. Goldberg resigned from his position of Canadian president of WebCT in 2002. In February 2006, WebCT was acquired by rival Blackboard Inc.Aol Mail not working As part of the acquisition terms with Blackboard, the WebCT name will be phased out in favor of the Blackboard brand. The majority of WebCT users moved away from Blackboard LMS. Many selected an open source LMS.http://listedtech.com/blog/webct-and-how-it-helped-open-source/ Textbooks and publishing The software was used in electronic publishing. In order to use a textbook or other learning tool published in the WebCT format, some publishers require the student to purchase a password at the bookstore or to obtain it online. The software permitted integration of material prepared locally with material purchased from publishers. Criticisms WebCT's user interface has been criticized as needlessly complex and unintuitive. The \\"Vista\\" version of the product represented an attempt to derive balance between flexibility and ease of use, however it has also been the target of ease-of-use criticisms.

Like the majority of Infocom's works, it was released simultaneously for several popular computer platforms of the time, such as the Commodore 64, Apple II, and PC. Journey is unusual among Infocom games in that it could be played entirely via mouse or joystick with no typing required. It was also the thirty-fifth and last game released by Infocom before parent company Activision closed the Cambridge office, effectively reducing Infocom to a \\"label\\" to be applied to later games. Plot The game package acknowledges the strong influence of Tolkien on the plot of Journey. A land reminiscent of Middle-earth has been ravaged by a mysterious, evil power. Crops, water, and the inhabitants themselves suffer from unexplainable illnesses and blights. A group of villagers ventured forth to seek the help of the reclusive wizard Astrix, but they have not been heard from in months. It is feared that few will survive the additional hardships of the coming winter, and so a second group is being dispatched. The four chosen are Bergon (a young carpenter), Praxix (a wizard), Esher (a healer), and Tag (a merchant). They leave their village behind to cross unknown lands with two goals: to discover the fate of the earlier party, and to plead Astrix for assistance. While Bergon is the leader the group, the story is told by Tag and, for the most part, seen through his eyes. Feelies Infocom game packages traditionally contained feelies, or \\"extra\\" items related in some way to the game that sometimes served as copy protection. The feelies for Journey were: *a red fabric pouch containing a \\"crystal\\" *a map of the land Notes Journey was the only game released under the \\"Infocom Roleplay Chronicles\\" genre. It contained illustrations similar to those used in James Clavell's Shōgun and Arthur: The Quest for Excalibur. The game's interface was highly unusual for Infocom. A large window at the top of the screen was divided between a graphic and text describing the current location. The bottom window was subdivided into additional sections: commands that could be performed by the party as a group, such as \\"Proceed\\" (continue along the current path), and characters in the party followed by commands available to each member (the wizard Praxix might be able to \\"Cast\\" a spell). The player used the keyboard, mouse, or joystick to select choices from these menus. This was a stark contrast to the majority of Infocom's other games, in which each command was typed in manually. After the player reached a non-winning end of the game, he or she was given the option to read \\"musings\\" by the narrator. These would typically refer to points in the game where things had gone wrong and give gentle hints on ways to reach a better ending. Journey was originally intended to be the first game in a trilogy. Critical reception G.M. magazine described Journey's storyline as lovely, and a refreshing departure from the graphical Tile-based game RPGs that were contemporary at the time. Computer Gaming World gave the game a glowing review, giving particular praise to the game's command interface, but also saying \\"Journey is full of delightful puzzles, superb prose, and finely honed legends.\\" References External links * *Scans of Journey packaging, documentation and feelies *Infocom-if.org's entry for Journey *The Infocom Bugs List entry for Journey 1980s interactive fiction 1989 video games Adventure games Amiga games Apple II games DOS games Infocom games Mac OS games Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Journey (1989 video game)"},{"id":"1780176","text":"Maria Mitsotáki (Μαρία Μητσοτάκη, 1907-1974) was an Athens socialite, born to a prominent Greek political family.

Language: Irish Gaelic, Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website. The language was introduced through mass immigration by Irish speakers, chiefly from counties Waterford, Tipperary and Cork, and Newfoundland subsequently became the only place to have a distinct Irish-language name outside Europe: (\\"Land of the (One) Fish\\"). The Irish spoken in Newfoundland was said to resemble the dialect spoken in Munster in the eighteenth century. Irish immigration A view of Trinity Bay, Newfoundland and Labrador, where Irish settlers were established by the late 17th century. The Irish language (also known as Gaelic) arrived in Newfoundland as a consequence of the English migratory cod fishery. While Sir Humphrey Gilbert formally claimed Newfoundland as an English overseas possession in 1583, this did not lead to permanent European settlement. A number of unsuccessful attempts at settlement followed, and the migratory fishery continued to grow. By 1620, fishermen from South West England dominated most of the east coast of Newfoundland, with the French dominant along the south coast and Great Northern Peninsula. After 1713, with the Treaty of Utrecht, the French ceded control of the south and north shores of the island to the British, keeping only the nearby islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the south coast.\\"Newfoundland Settlement and the Migratory Fishery\\", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website. Irish labourers were recruited for the fishery from southeast Ireland. Irish settlers were reported to be residing at Ireland's Eye, Trinity Bay, by 1675, at Heart's Content in 1696, and at St. John's by 1705.Newfoundland: The Most Irish Place Outside of Ireland, Brian McGinn, the Irish Diaspora Studies scholarly network, quoting Thomas F. Nemec, \\"The Irish Emigration to Newfoundland\\", pp. 16-17 Thomas Nash, an Irish Roman Catholic, was one of the later pioneers of Irish settlement in Newfoundland. A native of County Kilkenny, he arrived on the Southern Shore in 1765 and eventually settled in the Branch area.Memorial University, Intangible Cultural Heritage Branch Between 1750 and 1830, and particularly between 1793 and 1815, large numbers of Irish people, including many Irish speakers, emigrated to Newfoundland, known colloquially simply as \\"the Island\\". An account dating from 1776 describes how seasonal workers from Cork, Kerry, and elsewhere would come to Waterford to take passage to Newfoundland, taking with them all they needed.Young, pp. 131–132: \\"October 17 [1776]. Accompanied Lord Tyrone to Waterford; made some inquiries into the state of their trade... The number of people who go as passengers in the Newfoundland ships is amazing: from sixty to eighty ships, and from three thousand to five thousand annually. They come from most parts of Ireland, from Cork, Kerry, etc. Experienced men will get eighteen to twenty-five pounds for the season, from March to November. A man who never went will have five to seven pounds and his passage, and others rise to twenty pounds; the passage out they get but pay home two pounds. An industrious man in a year will bring home twelve to sixteen pounds with him, and some more. A great point for them is to be able to carry out all their slops, for everything, there is exceedingly dear, one or two hundred per cent. dearer than they can get them at home. They are not allowed to take out any woollen goods but for their own use. The ships go loaded with pork, beef, butter, and some salt; and bring home passengers, or get freights where they can; sometimes rum\\". A description of this enterprise (with a burlesque flavour) was given by the 18th-century Munster poet Donough MacConmara, describing his deep sea-chest filled with eggs, butter, bacon and other necessities: Some Irish immigrants to Newfoundland moved on, and many others were part of an annual seasonal migration between Ireland and Newfoundland. Most landed in the Newfoundland ports of St. John's and Harbour Grace, and many moved on to smaller outports on the coast of the Avalon Peninsula. By the 1780s, the Irish had become the dominant ethnic group in and around the St. John's area, in a population of about 3,200. Many were engaged in fishing and had little formal education. Many were servants who came to Newfoundland alone, but others had families, in which the labour of women and children was essential. Most families had a small plot of land.\\"Creed and Culture, 1784 to 1830: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage\\", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website. By 1815 the Irish in Newfoundland numbered over 19,000. Emigration was encouraged by political discontent at home, overpopulation and impoverishment. It was also aided by the fact that legislation of 1803 designed to regulate conditions on British passenger vessels, making the passage too expensive for the poorest, such as the Irish, did not apply to Newfoundland, which was viewed as a fishery rather than a colony.\\"Immigration\\", Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage website. Language and culture The coast of the Avalon Peninsula, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador The use of the Irish language in Newfoundland was closely tied to the persistence of an ancestral culture preserved in scores of enclaves along the coast.Driscoll, Marilyn, 'The Irish Language in New Brunswick' That culture, in the Avalon Peninsula and elsewhere, included feast days, holy wells, games, mumming, poetry, faction fighting, and the game of hurling. Church services were often conducted in the Irish language.O’Grady 2004, p. 56 The post-1815 economic collapse in Newfoundland after the Napoleonic Wars caused many of these Irish-speaking settlers to flee to the nearby Maritime colonies, taking their language with them.O’Grady 2004, p. 57 Court records show that defendants sometimes required Irish-speaking interpreters, as in the case of an Irishman in Fermeuse in 1752.Kirwan 1993, p. 68 Ecclesiastical records also illustrate the prevalence of Irish. In the mid-1760s the Reverend Laurence Coughlan, a Methodist preacher, converted most of the North Shore of Newfoundland to Protestantism. Observers credited the success of his evangelical revival at Carbonear and Harbour Grace to the fact that he was fluent in Irish. There are references to the need for Irish- speaking priests between 1784 and 1807. In letters to Dublin, the Catholic Bishop James Louis O'Donel, when requesting a Franciscan missionary for the parishes of St. Mary's and Trepassey, said that it was absolutely necessary that he should be able to speak Irish. O'Donel himself was an Irish speaker, and the fact that his successor Bishop Patrick Lambert (a Leinsterman and coadjutor bishop of St John's from 1806) had no Irish may have contributed to the mistrust shown towards him by Irish-speaking Newfoundlanders. Last traces The identities of the last speakers of Irish in Newfoundland are largely unknown. There is a lack of information of the sort available from the adjacent Province of New Brunswick (where, in the 1901 Census, several individuals and families listed Irish as their mother tongue and as a language still spoken by them). The question of how far Newfoundland Irish evolved as a separate dialect remains open. Irish left traces in Newfoundland English, such as the following: scrob \\"scratch\\" (Irish ), sleveen \\"rascal\\" (Irish ) and streel \\"slovenly person\\" (Irish ), along with grammatical features like the \\"after\\" perfect as in \\"she's already after leavin (Irish ). The most notable scholar of the Irish language in Newfoundland after it had disappeared, sometime early in the 20th century, was Aloysius (Aly) O'Brien, born in St. John's on 16 June 1915. He died there on 8 August 2008. O'Brien's paternal grandmother, Bridget Conway, had spoken Irish (which she had learned growing up in Ireland) but his father did not speak it. O'Brien taught himself Irish by means of language records, cassette tapes, and the booklets of Eugene O'Growney, a notable figure in Ireland’s Gaelic revival. O’Brien was thus enabled to become an authority on the many Irish words in the local English of the area and became a tutor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. He claimed, despite this, that he was not fluent in Irish, lacking opportunities for immersion.J. M. O'Sullivan, \\"Aloysius O'Brien, 93: Agronomist\\", in The Globe and Mail dated 13 October 2008 Current status There is no evidence of any attempt to revive a specifically Newfoundland form of Irish. There is some interest in the language generally, as indicated by the fact that Memorial University, St. John’s, Newfoundland, employs one of the Irish language instructors appointed every year by the Ireland Canada University Foundation to work in Canadian universities and support the Irish language in the wider community.Irish Language Instructors Through apps such as Duolingo, Irish is making a marked return to the province’s Irish descendants. The disappearance of Newfoundland Irish may be contrasted to the continued use of Scottish Gaelic in Cape Breton, though the survival of Gaelic there is not assured.

Ehrling was born in Malmö, Sweden, the son of a banker. From the age of 18 he attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Music in Stockholm. At the academy he studied the violin, organ, and piano as well as conducting. During World War II, he studied under both Karl Böhm and Albert Wolff. He made his public debut as a conductor with the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic in 1950, conducting Igor Stravinsky's \\"The Rite of Spring\\" from memory. In 1953 Ehrling was named the music director of the Royal Swedish Opera, a post he held until 1960. During these years he worked closely with the acclaimed singers tenor Jussi Björling and soprano Birgit Nilsson. In the early 1950s Ehrling recorded the first complete set of Sibelius symphonies with the Stockholm orchestra. In 1959 Ehrling took the production of Aniara, composed by Karl-Birger Blomdahl, to the Edinburgh International Festival. Ehrling's tenure with the Swedish Royal Opera ended in bitterness. He resigned his post and departed for the United States after he was asked to amend, and apologise for, his robust leadership style. In 1963 Ehrling replaced the departing Paul Paray as the principal conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. During his time in Detroit, the composer Luciano Berio had a brief residency. Ehrling was, perhaps, the perfect journeyman conductor. He could, and did, conduct everything well: opera, symphonic and choral music. He had perfect sympathy to style and period in whatever he conducted, focusing the attention on the music rather than himself. Unlike Leonard Bernstein or Leopold Stokowski, however, he did not take the role of innovator on the podium. Maestro Ehrling conducted nearly 700 works, including 24 world premieres, and helped inaugurate the Meadow Brook Summer Music Festival. In 1973, he made his Metropolitan Opera debut, where he conducted 12 different operas, including Wagner's \\"Ring Cycle.\\" He led 55 orchestras and ensembles in North and South America, and countless orchestras around the world, during his celebrated five decade career. Ehrling also taught at the Juilliard School of Music between 1973 and 1987. At Juilliard, Ehrling nurtured a new wave of conductors, including Myung-Whun Chung, JoAnn Falletta, Christian Badea, Victoria Bond, and Andrew Litton. Maestro Ehrling's difficult personality was overshadowed only by his wit. \\"Someone once told me I was not difficult, I was impossible. I agreed,\\" he confided to Detroit Free Press music critic John Guinn, 7/1/90. He told his American publicist that he preferred reading his reviews in the smallest room of his house, and brilliantly interwove business arrangements with extremely humorous observations. \\"In his final interview with Guinn, he noted that \\"They had a ceremony In Sweden for my birthday recently, and the man giving the birthday tribute had a great line. 'Mr. Ehrling nowadays is not angry,' he said. Then he paused, 'All the time,' he added.\\" Ehrling was one of the last conductors to know both Stravinsky and Sibelius, personally. When he discovered mistakes in their manuscripts, they were immediately informed. In 1987 Ehrling participated in the documentary A Woman Is a Risky Bet: Six Orchestra Conductors directed by Christina Olofson where he comments on the conservative attitudes towards women in the world of classical music. Sixten Ehrling died on February 13, 2005 in New York, where he had lived since the 1970s. He was married to a former Stockholm opera ballerina, Gunnel Lindgren. They had two daughters.David Nice, Obituary for Sixten Ehrling. The Guardian, 22 April 2005.

Life and career McCrum was born at Alverstoke in Hampshire.John E. Lewis. \\"McCrum, Michael William (1924–2005)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2009. The son of a naval Captain, he grew up at naval bases where his father was stationed. He was educated at Horris Hill School, Newbury and Sherborne School before Second World War service as an able seaman and then sub-lieutenant in the Royal Navy. He then won a scholarship to read classics at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1948 with a Double First. After graduation, McCrum became a master at Rugby School. He married the daughter of the headmaster, Sir Arthur fforde, in 1952. He was appointed Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1950 and was an (innovative) Tutor there under the Master, Sir George Thomson, and was also Director of Classical Studies. =Tonbridge School= McCrum left Cambridge in 1962 to become headmaster of Tonbridge School, where he earned a good reputation and transformed the school, emphasising academic standards and implementing sweeping reforms, including the abolition of the old traditions of fagging and caning of junior boys by \\"praepostors\\" (senior boys).Bourne, Richard. \\"Eton's topper\\", The Observer, London, 2 December 1969. He also made the Cadet Corps voluntary. The Tonbridgian (the school magazine) wrote in 1967 that \\"Never have there been so many changes in so short a time\\". By a stratagem, he contrived that straw boater hats (\\"barges\\") be retained, although there was a clear majority for their outright abolition in the poll of the boys which he arranged. His impressive stature and his ability to memorize the name and face of every boy (and teacher) in the school during the first week of the autumn term helped him to command respect. He later described part of his task at Tonbridge as having been \\"the reduction of stupid anachronisms\\" and \\"giving boys more liberties, provided they do not take them\\"; corporal punishment, he said, was \\"often the lesser of two evils\\".Rogers, Byron. \\"Eton's new head: a man for freedom\\". The Times, London, 2 December 1969, p. 1. While at Tonbridge, McCrum was an early supporter of the idea of education vouchers, and he opposed Labour Party proposals for school reform.\\"An educational 'toothless wonder'\\", The Times, London, 14 September 1964, p. 6. He criticised the reduction of the age of majority and the voting age to 18, saying that while they might be outwardly more mature than formerly, 18-year-olds \\"were still searching for guidance and authority\\" and \\"were less aware than formerly of the framework of tradition and the concept of the family community\\" under the increasing influence of the press and media.\\"Votes at 18 was 'hasty'\\", The Guardian, London, 18 February 1970, p. 5. =Eton College= In 1970 he became Head Master of Eton College, ostensibly a more prestigious position but perhaps one that allowed less initiative or authority than at Tonbridge. He raised standards at Eton after the era of Anthony Chenevix-Trench, whose weaknesses differentiated him from the self-disciplined McCrum. The curriculum was modernised and academic standards improved.Berthoud, Roger. \\"The good discipline of aiming at excellence\\", The Times, London, 14 July 1980, p. 12. Just before leaving Eton he oversaw the final abolition of fagging, as he had at Tonbridge earlier.Pallister, David. \\"Etonians end the era of fagging\\", The Guardian, London, 25 April 1980, p. 22.

He was appointed CBE in 1998. In addition to a collection of historical documents in Latin and Greek, compiled during his first spell at Corpus Christi, he wrote a biography of Thomas Arnold, the distinguished headmaster of Rugby.

Licensed to Rocky Mount, North Carolina, United States, it serves the Rocky Mount area. The station has been owned by WUNC Public Radio since 1999, though for its first seven years it was an independent public radio station based in Rocky Mount. History =At North Carolina Wesleyan College= On November 1, 1988, North Carolina Wesleyan College applied for a construction permit to build a new radio station in Rocky Mount. The station was conceived to fill the void left when WVSP, which was licensed to Warrenton but had moved its studios to Rocky Mount in 1985, shuttered in 1987. The college had initially gotten involved in efforts to keep WVSP in operation, but instead, it put together a new community group to build a new public radio station; among the members in 1989 were several people formerly associated with Sound and Print United, which owned WVSP. WESQ was granted its construction permit in 1990, and the station was taking shape in temporary facilities—a trailer beside the NCWC Student Activities Center—by 1991. Wesleyan was in the process of building a new fine arts building to house the station and a 1,200-seat auditorium. The station signed on in April 1992; in November, it brought NPR programming back to the region through a collaboration with WTEB in New Bern. =Friends of Down East Public Radio= The station's history took a turn in 1995 when North Carolina Wesleyan College decided to cease funding the station and cut all ties; the school said it had failed to find a way to integrate WESQ into its curriculum, and that running costs had been too high. A not-for-profit business group, Friends of Down East Public Radio, Inc., stepped in to buy the station from NCWC. Friends of Down East signed a lease agreement to move WESQ off the NCWC campus and into a city-owned building at downtown Rocky Mount that was formerly the headquarters of the Coastal Plains Life Insurance Company, though the property was also the site of a proposed library that would have required its demolition. The station went off the air on December 25 in order to prepare for the move to the new site, where a tower donated by the city of Tarboro was erected so the station could send programs to the transmitter. On April 1, 1996, the station returned as WRQM with NPR newsman and North Carolina native Carl Kasell joining local dignitaries, but the transmitter failed after two hours and the station returned to the air the next day. However, fundraising contributions were not as high as initially hoped; the 1997 spring fundraiser, while labeled a \\"success\\", still missed its goal by nearly $10,000. Additionally, the station had fewer than five full-time staff, which almost prompted NPR to drop the station as a full member for not meeting its criteria. =Sale to WUNC= In September 1998, the city of Rocky Mount began preparing to construct the library planned for the WRQM studio site. While the station was able to find a potential location for a new studio, a studio-to-transmitter link to the transmitter site on Temperance Road could not be set up from the proposed new facilities. Furthermore, the station was $135,000 in debt. By December, the station was weighing two merger offers: one from WTEB and one from WUNC. The board unanimously selected the WUNC bid. WUNC announced its intention to continue to offer local programming on WRQM, though WUNC began programming the station from Chapel Hill on March 24, 1999 under a time-share agreement, with two workers and a handful of local productions continuing in Rocky Mount for the time being. However, because of the loss of the former WRQM studios and state contracting policies preventing WUNC from leasing space for a studio in Rocky Mount, WUNC was approved to operate WRQM as a full-time satellite in 2001, which it operates as to this day.

Rigo De Righi (from left to right) at the base camp of Kanchenjunga Expedition The 1905 Kanchenjunga expedition was a Himalayan mountaineering expedition aimed to climb Kanchenjunga, which would only be climbed in 1955. The expedition was an idea of the Swiss doctor and photographer Jules Jacot-Guillarmod. In April 1905 he proposed his plans to the British occultist Aleister Crowley, with whom he had participated in Oscar Eckenstein's K2 expedition in 1902. Crowley only agreed to join since he would be the sole climbing leader and he would have the opportunity to break the altitude record.Maurice Isserman and Stewart Weaver, Fallen Giants: a history of Himalayan mountaineering from the age of empire to the age of extremes, Duke & Company, Devon, 2008. , pages 61-63. The record at the time was held by either William Woodman Graham, Emil Boss and Ulrich Kaufmann on Kabru (7,315 m), a widely contested, but possibly accurate claim,Willy Blaser & Glyn Hughes, Kabru 1883; A Reassessment, The Alpine Journal, 2009. or Matthias Zurbriggen on Aconcagua (6,962 m). Jacot-Guillarmod recruited two of his countrymen, Alexis Pache and Charles-Adolphe Reymond, while Crowley recruited his hotelkeeper in Darjeeling, the young Italian Alcesti C. Rigo de Righi, as transport officer. On July 31 the five left with three Kashmiri servants (who had been in the K2 expedition as well), and about 230 local porters. Armed with Douglas Freshfield's map of the range and Vittorio Sella's pictures, created during a circumnavigation of the massif in 1899, Crowley planned to climb the southwest face of Kanchenjunga over the Yalung Glacier. When Camp IV was made above this glacier, the team had fallen apart: Jacot-Guillarmod especially was shocked by Crowley's arrogant behavior and brutal treatment of the (barefooted) porters. Camp V was still made around 6,200 m, and on September 1, Crowley, Pache, Reymond and a group of porters made it to about 6,500 m before a small avalanche forced a nervous retreat. In his autobiography, Crowley claimed they reached about 25,000 feet or 7,620 m and proclaimed to have held the altitude record until the 1922 British Mount Everest expedition reached 8,320 m. The next day Jacot-Guillarmod and De Righi attempted to depose Crowley from expedition leadership. The argument could not be settled, and Jacot-Guillarmod, De Righi, and Pache decided to retreat from Camp V to Camp III. At 5 pm they left with four porters on a single rope, but a fall precipitated an avalanche that killed three porters as well as Alexis Pache. People in Camp V heard \\"frantic cries\\" and Reymond immediately descended to help, but Crowley stayed in his tent. That evening he wrote a letter to a Darjeeling newspaper stating that he had advised against the descent and that \\"a mountain 'accident' of this sort is one of the things for which I have no sympathy whatever\\". The next day Crowley passed the site of the accident without pausing nor speaking to the survivors and left on his own to Darjeeling, where he took the expedition funds, which mostly had been paid by Jacot-Guillarmod. The latter would get at least some of his money back after threatening to make public some of Crowley's pornographic poetry.

Originally designated the Marada Brigade ( Liwa al-Marada), the group initially emerged as the personal militia of Suleiman Frangieh, president of Lebanon at the outbreak of the war in 1975. They were also initially known as the Zgharta Liberation Army – ZLA (Arabic: Zgharta Jayish al-Tahrir) or Armée de Liberation de Zgharta (ALZ) in French, after Frangieh's hometown of Zgharta in northern Lebanon. Marada in Lebanese History The Marada were a group of independent communities in Lebanon and the surrounding highlands after the conquest of Syria by the Arab army in 630 CE. While some historians argue that the Marada \\"States\\" were that of a Maronite Aramaic-speaking Christian warrior elite, other historians tend to their downplay importance, and describe a more complex scenario. The Maronites and thus the Marada were given relative autonomy in the Umayyad Caliphate. The Marada were known by some as a fierce warrior group, and according to some, the name was synonymous with the Arabic word for rebels or also Maronites. During the Lebanese civil war was called one of the Maronite militias \\"Marada Movement\\". During the Lebanese civil war, Zgharta was the frontline and Christian stronghold of the north in northern Lebanon. The Zgharta-based Marada Brigade militia successfully repulsed and responded with attacks on armed militias from Tripoli, Danniyeh and Koura districts, and from PLO militias from the neighboring Palestinian refugee camps of Beddawi and Nahr al-Bared. In March 1976, the Marada Brigade supported the hard-pressed Lebanese Army Republican Guard Battalion in defending the Presidential Palace in Baabda from a two-pronged combined LNM–LAA assault, though prior to the attack the Lebanese President had decamped to the safety of Jounieh.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), pp. 46–47. The Marada were initially allied with the Kataeb until 1978, the year when Suleiman Frangieh refused the Lebanese Front's plan to declare a Christian canton, a Christian enclave separated from the rest of the country. A new alliance was formed between Suleiman Frangieh and Prime Minister Rachid Karami to counter the Lebanese Front's plan that called for separate enclaves/cantons of Christians, Druze and Muslims. Frangieh became firmly set against the onset of a Lebanese federal state that would make an alliance with Israel, promoted instead an Arab pro-Syrian alliance and stopped attending meetings with the Lebanese Front. To the Lebanese Front, Frangieh's decision represented a traitorous act against uniting Christians in Lebanon. They retaliated by mounting an attack on Ehden and the Christian villages around it. The area is a stronghold of the Maronite and Orthodox Christians of North Lebanon and the summer residence of Suleiman Frangieh. The Lebanese Forces led by Bashir Gemayel and Samir Geagea under a pretext of revenge to the killing of a Kataeb member in the district of Zgharta Zawie Joud Al-Bayeh, launched a murderous attack to quell the Frangiehs' influence. On 13 June 1978, at 4 a.m. a joint force of the Lebanese Forces and Kataeb launched an attack on Tony Frangieh's summer residence in Ehden and the surrounding villages, killing the Marada's top commander, Suleiman Frangieh's son Tony, a member of Parliament and Minister of Communications, his wife Vera, their 3-year-old daughter and about 28 men, women and children. About 11 Lebanese Forces militia men and Kataeb were killed in the attack. Tony Frangieh's son, Suleiman Frangieh, Jr., escaped the massacre as he was not with his family in Ehden at that time. The incident is known as the Ehden massacre. Kataeb member at the time Samir Geagea, who allegedly headed the Phalangist force responsible for the Ehden massacre, admitted that he was among the \\"military squad\\" that was in charge of the Ehden \\"operation\\", but he denied taking part in the massacre, claiming that he was shot in his right hand before getting to the area and was taken to a hospital. Elie Hobeika has always denied taking part in the killing. After Tony's assassination, his brother Robert took control of the Marada. Nowadays Suleiman Frangieh, Jr., Tony's son, is in charge of the Marada. He is a close personal friend of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He was serving as Interior Minister, in the Lebanese government, when Rafiq al-Hariri was assassinated on 14 February 2005. After the 2005 legislative elections, the Marada became a member of the opposition alliance (pro-Syrian) together with Hezbollah. In June 2006, the Marada Movement was officially launched as a political party during a ceremony attended by supporters and representatives from Hezbollah, Amal Movement, the Free Patriotic Movement, and some pro- Syrian political figures.

Although Mao had wished to be cremated, his wishes were ignored and his body was embalmed. The construction of a mausoleum as his final resting place began shortly after his death. This highly popular attraction is located in the middle of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It stands on the previous site of the Gate of China, the southern (main) gate of the Imperial City during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The embalmed body of Chairman is preserved in the cooler, central hall of the mausoleum in a glass case with dim lighting; it is guarded by a military honor guard. The mausoleum is open to the public every day except Mondays. History The mausoleum is located on Tiananmen Square, where the Gate of China used to stand (2005) The mausoleum was built soon after Mao's death on September 9, 1976. The groundbreaking ceremony took place November 24, 1976, and the mausoleum was completed on May 24, 1977. Chairman Hua Guofeng, who supervised the mausoleum project, has his handwriting on the mausoleum's sign. People throughout China were involved in the design and construction of the mausoleum, with 700,000 people from different provinces, autonomous regions, and nationalities doing symbolic voluntary labor. Materials from all over China were used throughout the building: granite from Sichuan province, porcelain plates from Guangdong province, pine trees from Yan'an in Shaanxi province, saw-wort seeds from the Tian Shan mountains in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, earth from quake-stricken Tangshan, colored pebbles from Nanjing, milky quartz from the Kunlun Mountains, pine logs from Jiangxi province, and rock samples from Mount Everest. Water and sand from the Taiwan Straits were also used to symbolically emphasize the People's Republic of China's claims over Taiwan. The mausoleum was closed for renovations for nine months in 1997 before reopening on January 6, 1998. Sculptures alt=A brown stone sculpture of soldiers fighting with various weapons, led by one carrying a flag with a man's face in profile on it Inside the mausoleum is a statue of Mao. There are four sculptural groups installed outside the mausoleum. Visits The mausoleum today remains a popular destination in Beijing, and is often visited by foreign dignitaries and Chinese Communist Party officials. Foreign heads of state, such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro visited the mausoleum during their state trips to China. On 29 September 2019, General Secretary Xi Jinping along with other Politburo members of the Chinese Communist Party visited the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall. Xu Jing (), one of the designers involved in the mausoleum's construction, later wrote about the process in The Place Where a Great Man Rests as well as listing the visits of important people to the mausoleum. However, his own visit on September 8, 1979, was not mentioned in the book, by order of the Chinese government, again for reasons never explained.

The railway, originally incorporated by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe as the Pasadena & Mt. Wilson Railroad Co.,Seims, Charles,Mount Lowe, The Railway in the Clouds, p.33. existed from 1893 until its official abandonment in 1938, and had the distinction of being the only scenic mountain, electric traction (overhead electric trolley) railroad ever built in the United States. Lowe's partner and engineer was David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer graduate of Cornell University. The Mount Lowe Railway was a fulfillment of 19th century Pasadenans' desire to have a scenic mountain railroad to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains. The Railway opened on July 4, 1893, and consisted of nearly seven miles (11.2 km) of track starting in Altadena, California, at a station called Mountain Junction. Atop Echo stood the magnificent 70-room Victorian hotel, the Echo Mountain House. Only a few hundred feet away stood the 40-room Echo Chalet which was ready for opening day. The complement of buildings on Echo included an astronomical observatory, car barns, dormitories and repair facilities, a casino and dance hall, and a menagerie of local fauna.Seims, ch 5. For the seven years during which Lowe owned and operated the railway, it constantly ran into hard times, eventually being sold off. A series of natural disasters ate away at the facilities, the first of which was a kitchen fire that destroyed the Echo Mountain House in 1900. Further fires and floods eventually destroyed any remaining facilities, and the railway was officially abandoned in 1938 after a flood washed most everything off the mountain sides. Today, the ruins of Mount Lowe Railway remain as a monument to a once-ever experienced enterprise. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Places on January 6, 1993, a listing that was enlarged in January 2015. Physical description Topographical map The railway terminal, called Mountain Junction, was located at the corner of Lake Avenue and Calaveras Street in the unincorporated community of Altadena. The line was divided into 3 divisions: the Mountain Division, the Great Incline, and the Alpine Division. The mode of locomotion was electric traction railway, and a cable driven incline funicular. Electrical power for the railway consisted of several power generating stations equipped with either gas engines or Pelton wheels, depending on the availability of mountain water.Harrigan, John, Mount Lowe Power, 2000, self- published, . =Mountain Division= The Mountain Division, originally built as a narrow gaugeERHA - Mount Lowe Line line, began with a trolley that ascended Lake Avenue to a turnoff near Las Flores Street, along a private right-of-way through the Poppyfields district, and proceeded into Rubio Canyon to the foot of Echo Mountain. Since this part of the line ran through the upper end of the residential community, it had station stops at Newkirk (Las Flores), Poppyfields, Hygeia (recovery hospital), and Roca before entering the Rubio Canyon. A transition bridge was installed to cross the Rubio Wash named Las Flores Bridge.Seims, pp. 38 and 62. At Rubio there was a large platform that spanned the canyon with an integrated 12-room hotel, the Rubio Pavilion. Other features at the pavilion were a series of stairways and bridges that ascended the canyon for viewing some eleven waterfalls, all of which were named.Seims, p. 57. The Mountain Division's tracks were converted to in 1903.Mount Lowe Preservation Society - Mount Lowe Timeline =Great Incline= From this platformSeims, pp. 54–55. passengers could transfer to a narrow gauge, three-railed inclined plane railway, the \\"Great Incline,\\" and ascend Echo Mountain (elev. ). The Incline powering mechanism was designed by San Francisco cable car inventor Andrew Smith Hallidie. It boasted grades as steep as 62% and as slight as 48%, and gained in elevation. The Great Incline was the first of its kind built with three rails and featuring a four-railed passing track at the halfway point.Seims, pp. 42–46 A particular feature on the Incline was the Macpherson Trestle named by Lowe for his engineer, David J. Macpherson, as was custom, and noted for its exceptional design in crossing a granite chasm over deep.Seims, p. 116. =Echo Mountain= Mt. Lowe Incline 1908 Devil's Gateway, Mt. Lowe Railway,circa 1910-1920 Professor Lowe had a dream to make the beautiful Mountains overlooking the cities of Altadena / Pasadena accessible to average citizens. After much planning, many exploratory trips on horseback, he and Engineer Thomas McPherson located a series of routes that could be built upon with a series of rail cars to reach miles back into the forest and eventually all the way to the top of Mount Wilson. Financing the project himself, Professor Lowe proceeded to build his dream which eventually reached all the way to the base of Mount Lowe (named after Professor Lowe, previously known as Oak Mountain). At its peak, it was the top honeymoon destination in America. Beginning with the famous red car lines in California, Professor Lowe extended the line up through the rolling hills in Rubio Canyon where a small hotel was built at the base of new incline rail systems that would take a visitor up a mile along a ridge overlooking the LA Basin to the top of Echo Mountain. The top of Echo Mountain became a little city of its own with places to eat, order picnic lunches, shop at stores, dormitories for employees, power generating station to power Echo Mountain facilities. There was also a trolley repair building and pit, observation decks at various spots, trails that could be taken by hikers both up and down the mountain and into the Alpine regions, tennis courts, stables and a now little known zoo. The entire assembly of buildings were painted white and because of the view from far below, became known as \\"The White City in the sky\\". The \\"opera box\\" great incline cars were also white and could be seen from afar ferrying up and down the hill. On a ridge behind the Echo Mountain ridge was an observatory building with a working 16 inch telescope housed in a round domed building. The foundations can still be found at the site as well as the cement stand which is what the telescope was mounted upon. It was Professor Lowe's intention to build the rail system all the way to the top of Mount Wilson along with additional hotels and facilities on the top of Mount Wilson. Later, much of the path of the large 100 inch telescope and observatory built on Mount Wilson was used to transport the delicate 100 inch mirror to the top of Mount Wilson. =Alpine Division= The third division, the Alpine Division, opened in 1896 and consisted of of narrow gauge track with 127 curves and 18 bridges and trestles.Seims, p. 156. On this line there were three cars available for shuttling between Echo and the end-of-line, though only one car ever operated at a time due to electrical limitations, and there was no two-way traffic. The division spanned the broad face of Las Flores Canyon, rounded a promontory called the \\"Cape of Good Hope,\\" traveled deep into Millard Canyon, reappeared at the front face of the mountain, and eventually disappeared into Grand Canyon where it terminated at the foot of Mount Lowe. This location was called Crystal Springs (elev. ) for a stream of water that poured from the hillside, and it was here that the last of the hotels, the 12-room Swiss-style chalet, \\"Ye Alpine Tavern,\\" was built.

The Mount Lowe Railway was born from a desire of the Pasadena Pioneers to have a scenic mountain railroad to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains. There was already established a trail to the peak of Mount Wilson, but that trip was arduous and ofttimes required more than a day to travel up and down. Several proposals were floated to establish some sort of mechanical transportation to the summits, but they all lacked funding. David J. Macpherson (b. 1854, Ontario, Canada), a civil engineer from Cornell University and a newcomer to Pasadena (1885), proposed a steam driven cog wheel train to reach the crest via Mount Wilson. It wasn't until he was introduced to the millionaire Thaddeus S. C. Lowe (arrived in Pasadena 1890) that a fully funded plan could be put into action. The two men visited Colorado to view the mountain railway to Pike's Peak. Lowe was impressed with the trolley car systems in the city and thought that should be the way to go. This would make the Mount Lowe Railway the only electric traction rail line ever to be put into scenic mountain railway service. =Incorporation= The two men incorporated the Pasadena & Mount Wilson Railroad Co. in 1891 with intentions to build the railroad to Mount Wilson. Unable to obtain rights of way to Mt. Wilson, Macpherson suggested an alternate route, toward Oak Mountain, a high peak to the west of Mount Wilson. They hired electrical engineer, Almarian W. Decker, who had contrived all the mathematical possibilities of an electric line and the funicular which would be required to ascend the Echo Mountain Promontory. =Construction= Mountain Division Blasting into the Rubio Canyon began in September 1892,Seims, p. 37. three months before the establishment of the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve (now Angeles National Forest). A terminal was built at the corner of Calaveras Street and Lake Avenue in Altadena adjacent to the L. A. Terminal Railway station, and a narrow gauge line was laid up the 8% grade to a point near Las Flores Street where it turned eastward traversing the Poppyfields district and headed into Rubio Canyon. At the Rubio division terminus was built a broad platform to span the Canyon which included the Rubio Pavilion, a 12-room hotel, with dining facilities and other amenities. The pavilion also consisted of power generating facilities with the use of gas engines and Pelton waterwheels. Water was made available from reservoirs built in the canyon's streams, though water was not always plentiful year round. As part of the entertainment experience, Lowe had a series of stairways and bridges built over the streams and waterfalls that emanated from the canyon. The eleven waterfalls were individually named and today exist as local historical landmarks. The Great Incline The plan for a three railed incline devised by Prof. Lowe Work was begun on the Great Incline, which featured such steep grades that no mule could be flogged enough into negotiating it. Instead, materials were carried up on the back of laborers; grading became a particular problem. While funiculars were usually considered to require four rails, two for the ascending car, and two for the descending car, there was not enough room to widen the grade to accommodate four rails. Over night the inventive Thaddeus Lowe came up with a plan to only use four rails where the cars pass each other and three rails on the upper and lower ends of the run, whereby the cars shared the center rail.Seims, p. 34. The ingenious three-railed funicular not only fit, but it also reduced the amount of required materials. This three-railed design has been applied on other places as well (e.g. Angels Flight). The Macpherson Trestle A great feat of engineering was realized with a trestle that was built to negotiate a granite chasm across of track on a 62% grade. The trestle was named, as was customary in railroad constructions, for the chief engineer, David Macpherson, thus, the Macpherson Trestle.Seims, p. 42. The Great Incline cable mechanism was engineered by Andrew Smith Hallidie of San Francisco cable car fame. It climbed with approximately of cable spliced into a complete loop which raised and lowered the cars of the Incline. At the Echo summit an incline powerhouse was erected to house the winding motor and gear works which powered the grip wheel. The wheel consisted of 72 clamping \\"finger\\" mechanisms which bit down on the cable creating a smooth, non-slip actuation of the winding cable.Seims, p. 46-47. The cable was a -inch (41.275 mm) steel cable spliced in two spots, one below each of the incline passenger cars and looped in a continuous strand around the grip wheel at the top of the incline and a tension wheel at the bottom. The incline grade changed three times from a steep 62% grade at the base to a gentler 48% grade at the top, but the cars were designed to comfortably adjust to the differences in grade. The incline was also equipped with a safety cable which ran through an emergency braking mechanism under each car and provided an emergency stopping of the cars within should a failure of the main cable occur. Echo Mountain The Echo Mountain House was a 70-room Victorian hotel opened in November 1894 at the summit of the Echo Mountain promontory. The Echo Mountain site was ready for opening day, July 4, 1893, with the 40-room \\"Echo Chalet.\\"Seims, pp. 66–67. By November 1894 the 80-room Victorian \\"Echo Mountain House\\" was completed as a luxury facility to rival the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego.Seims, pp. 74–75. Lowe also installed a telescope and observatory on Echo, as he was a patron of the astronomical arts. He even sought to have the Mount Lowe Railway considered the astronomical center of the San Gabriels. He was even able to enlist astronomer Dr. Lewis Swift, whose reputation preceded him. Given the lack of light pollution in the area, Swift was able to discover some 95 new nebulae from the Echo vantage point.Seims, p. 79. (\\"It could be noted that in an earlier 1892 plan, Charles William Eliot President of Harvard University sought to have a telescope put on Mt. Wilson. Lowe offered the use of his new Mount Wilson Railroad to transport the lenses up. However, the project benefactor died without leaving a trust, and the whole plan failed, and of course Lowe's train didn't end up going to Mt. Wilson either\\").Seims, p. 70. A panorama from the Echo Mountain House Remains (2007) Prof. Lowe's success was greatly drawn from his nationally renowned process of generating large amounts of hydrogen gas (see water gas). He had built a gas plant in Pasadena and had piped the gas some eight miles (13 km) to the top of Echo where there was a storage container seen in several earlier photographs.Seims, pp. 68 and 94. The technology, mainly used for heating and lighting, was soon replaced by electricity. Echo Mountain also sported a menagerie (zoo) which housed several species of local fauna: lynxes, raccoons, snakes, squirrels,Seims, p.76. and even a black bear.Seims, photo p. 87. Alongside the zoo was a dormitory and shop facility for maintenance of the trains. Lowe purchased a three million candlepower searchlight from the Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893.Seims, p. 80. The light was installed on Echo in 1894. So powerful was the light, that a claim by Lowe's publicist, George Wharton James, stated that he could read a newspaper by the beam of the light coming through his hotel window on Catalina Island. Exaggeration or not, the beam from the light did have a projection. Residents announcing their birthdays could have the light shone on their homes in the evening. It was also known to stir up a corral of horses, invade lovers’ privacy, and interrupt an evening's revival meeting. By the 1930s the light was considered a public nuisance and was shut off permanently. The Alpine Division Circular Bridge was a marvel of engineering designed to easily guide an electric traction trolley car through a simple in elevation. A third division, the Alpine Division, was begun in 1894 and took a lengthy stretch of narrow gauge track across three canyons to the foot of Mount Lowe (formerly Oak Mountain).Seims, ch. 3. The line ran from alongside the incline landing where passengers could transfer directly to the next trolley. There were three trains available on this line, but the limited electrical power only allowed one at a time to travel. The line set out across the broad Las Flores Canyon which gave a tremendous panorama of the Los Angeles area below. At one point a tall trestle was required to bridge a broad and deep chasm with a bridge so named High Bridge. At the ridge which separates Las Flores Canyon from Millard Canyon, the right of way was cut around a bluff named Cape of Good Hope. On the back side of the bluff was a section of straight track labeled \\"longest straight track 225 ft [68.6 m].\\"Seims, p. 161. From there the rails led deep into Millard Canyon before making a complete turnabout at Horseshoe Curve and heading back to the face of the mountain.Seims, p. 164. Once again overlooking the valley, the train made a broad sweep around Circular Bridge. The design of the bridge, more a trestle, was to allow the trolley to negotiate a switchback, over of track, at a 4% grade in a 340° turn. The wooden structure resembled a section of roller coaster offering an awesome sight over the side of the car looking almost straight down.Seims, p. 166. Ye Alpine Tavern, est. 1896, was the end-of-the- line for the Mount Lowe Railway at the foot of Mount Lowe. It was renamed The Mount Lowe Tavern in 1925, and was burned down in September 1936. From the switchback the train made a return trip into Millard Canyon. At the transition point of Millard and Grand Canyons, construction was met by a large granite crag that required 8 months of dynamiting and mucking to allow just enough passage for the narrow gauge cars. The site was named Granite Gate at in elevation.Seims, p. 94-95. The last stretch of track reached deep into Grand Canyon on a gentle grade that ended up at the foot of Mt. Lowe. There in a location called Crystal Springs, Lowe built a 12-room, Swiss chalet styled hotel named \\"Ye Alpine Tavern.\\" It was also flanked by cottages and tent cabins to augment its occupancy. The Tavern boasted several amenities, such as a wading pool, tennis courts, mule rides, gift shop, restaurant, and a silver fox farm. This spot marked the end of the line, nearly 7 miles (11.2 km) from its starting point at Mountain Junction. Visitors The Echo Mountain Promotory (ca. 1896) after a snowfall, and the White City resort of the Mount Lowe Railway as seen from a higher spot on the ridge and overlooking Altadena, CA. Buildings viewed from left to right: The Echo Chalet, Echo Mountain House, Incline Powerhouse, Dormitories and Car Barn. Behind the car barn, note an inflatable reservoir for the storage of hydrogen gas produced in Pasadena and piped some 8½ miles to Echo. The Mount Lowe Railway opened officially on July 4, 1893. Folks amassed themselves at the remote Mountain Junction. Up to this point there was only one means of public transportation from the valleys below to the hillside community of Altadena. It was the Los Angeles Terminal Railway which by this time was running from Terminal Island in San Pedro to Mountain Junction. The trains ran twice a day, and very irregularly at that, so the only sure means of getting to Altadena on time was by your own horse and buggy. This lack of transportation, coupled with Lowe's inability to establish any at all, would be in part the downfall of the railway. Nevertheless, over its 45 years of existence, it is estimated that some 3 million people had ridden the railway, many coming from all parts of the country and the world. In its own inimitable way, it was a Disneyland of the day. Lowe had two favorite days of the year, Independence Day and Christmas, during which he would mark special events of his lifetime. A publication which emanated from the Tavern daily was the Echo, a preprinted newspaper with a blank page that had the names and home states of the daily arrivals surprinted. The four-page tabloid had three pages of biographical information on the railroad and other announcements of daily events. At the top of the incline was perched Charles Lawrence, the official photographer, on a special scaffold from which he would take pictures of the arriving visitors.Seims, p. 149, p. 205 For 25 cents, visitors could purchase a souvenir photo of their arrival on the incline car, with everyone else aboard, of course. George Wharton James, Lowe's publicist, had his own publication which touted the railway in its conception, construction, and operation. Megaphones, called \\"echophones\\", were installed on Mount Echo through which visitors could bellow into the back canyons and receive a number of echoes. The \\"sweet spot\\" where the most repeaters could be heard had at least nine reverberations of anything that was shouted loud enough. The study of the sweet spot has even been used as boy scout projects. Along the way in Millard Canyon, a special station stop was made at Dawn Station above the Dawn Mines, an old gold mining operation.Seims, p. 149. The mines were deep in the canyon and visitors stopping off to see the digs spent an exorbitant amount of time getting back to the train. A false adit was dug just a hundred feet below the track to trick people into thinking they had visited the mine and were shortly ready to return to the train. The mountain itself offered a grand display of nature and hiking trails, plus a mule ride, the \\"Mount Lowe Eight,\\" that transported guests around a trail. This trail made a large figure eight traverse of Mt. Lowe and Mount Echo, starting and ending at the Alpine Tavert without ever traversing the same terrain twice.Seims, P. 99. In 1922 Henry Ford visited the Mount Lowe Railway and returned with a Hollywood filming crew who made a silent film documentary of the trip with the camera mounted on the various cars, including the Great Incline. of this historic film is available at the Library of Congress.Seims, p.205. Troubled times In all, there were four hotels along the line, but the extent of the construction and the poor patronage had stretched Lowe to his limit. By 1898 the railroad fell into receivership under Jared Sidney Torrance, founder of Torrance, California. Both men applied to the government for rights of way to the top of Mt. Lowe. The government realized that the whole railroad was on Federal property (vis-à-vis the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve) and demanded that a proper lease be taken out on the properties. Having reviewed Lowe's standing with the railway, Congress awarded the receivership to Torrance in 1899, and Lowe was left with only the title to the observatory. It was at this time that the railway was reorganized and incorporated as the Mount Lowe Railway. The railway was sold at auction to a Mr. Valentine Peyton of Danville, Illinois, who personally came to California to run the operation. =Disasters strike= In 1900, the Echo Mountain House burned down.Seims, p. 121. It was grossly underinsured and was never rebuilt. Later, the astronomer Dr. Swift went blind and was forced to leave his post at the observatory. A second astronomer, Prof. Edgar Lucien Larkin (1847–1925), was hired to oversee the observatory. Though he was not as prominent as Prof. Swift, he did stay with the Mount Lowe Observatory until his sudden death in 1925. Disenchanted, Peyton sold the railway to Henry E. Huntington, after which it became part of the Pacific Electric Railway (PE), of the famed Los Angeles Red Car system.Seims, p. 123. Part of the P&E; improvements included a \\"casino\\" on Echo Mountain. The building appears in a few rare photos and was described as a dance hall, not a gambling facility. Most historians believe that the casino was built only a few months before the fire of 1905. The blaze began when a forceful wind blew the roof from the casino onto the power generating station across the track, setting a fire that razed everything on Echo except the observatory and the astronomer's cabin.Seims, p131. The only part of the Echo operation that was restored was the Incline Powerhouse in 1906. Other improvements were made to the railway, such as the replacement of rock pile footings under each trestle with reinforced concrete pilings. In 1909, an unseasonable electrical storm and flash flood destroyed the Rubio Pavilion and buried one of the caretakers’ children in the mud.Seims, p. 145. The Fred Drew family. The injured parents spent years in the hospital recuperating from the devastation that left them trapped in the rubble of the Pavilion. Three of the children, who knew how to move the incline cars, escaped to the top of the incline. Remains of the Echo Mountain House in 2007 In 1928 a strong Santa Ana Wind blew down the observatory. Its curator at the time, Mt. Lowe photographer Charles Lawrence, escaped the collapse within an inch of his life.Seims, p. 204. Fortunately, he had the foresight to pack up the expensive lens pieces ahead of time. The instrument has since been reinstalled at Santa Clara University. In 1925 a large block brick annex was added to \\"Ye Alpine Tavern\\" and the facility was renamed \\"Mount Lowe Tavern.\\" In September 1936 the tavern burned to the ground from an electrical fire.Seims, p. 206. The P&E; was officially out of business, but left train operators on the line, so as not to abandon the railway. Though there was a slight consideration to rebuild, lack of water, poor area for relocation, and the financial burden of construction and insurance left the P&E; all but giving up on the Mount Lowe Railway. Incline cable gripwheel and guide wheels left as monument to Professor Lowe and the Mount Lowe Railway. The monument was acclaimed by The Altadena and Pasadena Historical Societies, the Pasadena Pioneers, and the U. S. Forestry Service, 1963. Historical Marker of the Lowe Railway In December, 1937, the Railroad Booster's Club, enthusiasts of the P&E; Railroad, requested a final paid excursion on the line for photos and memorabilia.Seims, p. 209. A few months later, in March, 1938 a three-day deluge of rain destroyed what was left of the railway and stranded the caretakers on Echo for 17 days. Following this disaster, the railway was officially abandoned.Seims, p. 212. The flood rained of water in 100 hours. =Dismantling= The Red Car line ran into Altadena until 1941. At the onset of World War II, the dismantling of the Mount Lowe Railway was contracted to a scrapper who stripped the railway of all salvageable materials.Seims, p. 217. In 1959 the Forestry service began dynamiting the remains of buildings as \\"hazardous nuisances.\\" In 1962 the Incline Powerhouse was dynamited, but the gear mechanism was placed as a monument to the enterprise.Seims, p. 218. Historical landmark In 1992 a committee of the Pacific Railroad Society, successors to the Railroad Boosters, began a project of \\"revealment\\" which, under the supervision of Mike McIntyre, Angeles National Forest archaeologist, sought to uncover the ruins of Echo Mountain. On January 6, 1993, the Mount Lowe Railway was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the Forestry Service dedicated a block of land for the monument that would encompass all the artifacts from the railroad. On July 4, 1993, a centennial celebration was held on Mount Echo, and a separate celebration was held on Macpherson Parkway in the Poppyfields district. Today care of the artifacts and other restorative projects are being carried out by the Scenic Mount Lowe Railway Historical Committee under the leadership of Brian Marcroft and John Harrigan. The committee has become a group of uniformed forestry volunteers who continue to work closely with the forestry headquarters in Arcadia, California.

Education and military service Gaetano Kenneth Molinari, \\"who changed his middle name as a teenager to Victor\\" was born on Manhattan's Lower East Side. His father was S. Robert Molinari (1897–1957), \\"the first Italian immigrant to serve in the New York state Assembly,\\" representing the 2nd District of Richmond County in the New York State Assembly from 1943 to 1944, and after changing from a Republican to a Democrat wasn't reelected. His mother, Elizabeth Margaret (Majoros), was of Czechoslovakian descent. Molinari attended private schools growing up and graduated from New Dorp High School in Staten Island in 1945. He attained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Staten Island's Wagner College in 1949 and his law degree from New York Law School in 1951. He served in the United States Marine Corps (attaining the rank of sergeant), from 1951 to 1953 during the Korean War. He was admitted to the New York State Bar following his discharge from the military in 1953 and commenced practice in Staten Island. Political career Molinari was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly from 1975 to 1980, sitting in the 181st, 182nd and 183rd New York State Legislatures. He was a delegate to the New York State Republican conventions in 1979 and the Republican National Convention in both 1980 and 1984. In 1980, he was elected to the House of Representatives, unseating nine-term Democrat John M. Murphy. In 1982, his district was merged with that of four-term Democrat Leo Zeferetti, and he won with 57%. He was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses with minimal opposition and served from January 3, 1981, until his resignation December 31, 1989, to become Borough President of Staten Island. He was succeeded in the House by his daughter, Susan, who also served on the New York City Council. He served as Borough President from January 1, 1990 to December 31, 2001. In 1994, a week before the statewide elections, Molinari announced his view that Karen Burstein, the Democratic nominee for New York Attorney General, was not qualified to serve as attorney general because she was a lesbian. The combination of Molinari's remarks, a strong national Republican showing, and the win of George Pataki in the governor's race, led to Republican Dennis Vacco's narrowly defeating Burstein. The New York Times called his remarks \\"gutter politics\\". Family and personal Guy Molinari's daughter Susan succeeded him as a member of Congress. She is married to Bill Paxon, a former United States House Representative from Buffalo. A Life of Service (book) Molinaro co-authored his autobiography A Life of Service with former NYC Police Lt. -Kossman, a \\"highly decorated cop, who is also a lawyer and a registered nurse.\\" Feerick, after five years of appeals, began to serve her sentence for having illegally searched for a stolen police radio.

Its innovative guitar and production techniques consolidated the experimentation of the band's preceding EPs, and would make it a pioneering work of the subgenre known as shoegazing. Upon its release, the album received rave critical reviews and reached number one on the UK Independent Albums Chart. Background After the band's original vocalist Dave Conway left in 1987, to be replaced by Bilinda Butcher, the band continued for a while in their previous noisy indie-pop style before Kevin Shields returned to their avant- garde roots, and began to explore the possibilities offered by the studio facilities available after signing to Creation Records in 1988. The first fruit of this experimentation was the single/EP \\"You Made Me Realise\\", released in July 1988, with Isn't Anything following later that year. \\"Kevin gave me 'You Made Me Realise', which was supposed to be a track on their first EP for us,\\" recalled Creation head Alan McGee. \\"I went, That's the single! He was shocked, cos they'd only done the track as a joke. Then they did stuff for their album, and I said, Go for more of the weirder stuff. So they went back and did stuff like 'Soft as Snow'. Those are the only suggestions I've ever given them.\\"Select, April 1994 Most of the album was recorded in a studio in Wales. While recording the album over a period of two weeks, the band got by on about two hours sleep a night. Bilinda Butcher described the effect of this: \\"Often, when we do the vocals, it's 7:30 in the morning: I've usually fallen asleep and have to be woken up to sing. Maybe that's why it's languorous. I'm usually trying to remember what I've been dreaming about when I'm singing.\\" Music The style of Isn't Anything has been labeled as shoegazing, avant-rock,Music Times dream pop, lo-fi, noise pop, and experimental pop. Q's Stuart Maconie said that the album \\"was the first full- length expression of this remarkable new sound: gossamer vocals and insinuating melodies glimpsed through sheets of blurred, opaque noise.\\" Melody Maker described its sound as \\"swoon-songs, oblivious, languorous vocals and out-of-focus guitars which are like being taken to the brink of consciousness and held there.\\" Taylor Parkes of The Quietus described the album as \\"livid, lurid and lucid,\\" and called it \\"the shattering racket of the moment, an audio snapshot of the overwhelmed senses, a noise like nothing you've ever heard, but everything you've ever felt.\\" In his book Alternative Rock, Dave Thompson described the album's sound as \\"dry ice-piercingly intense guitar drones and hefty nods to miasmic hardcore soup, oozing a contrary trance-spun drone. Noise becomes beauty as feedback is layered over vocals over feedback ad infinitum.\\" Anthony Carew of About.com described its style as \\"atonal, desconstructed, free-noise guitar playing\\" and noted that it had an \\"ethereal, spectral quality that radically reconfigured the predominant paradigms of rock'n'roll.\\" \\"Several Girls Galore\\" has been described as \\"a cubist take on the Jesus and Mary Chain.\\" Release Isn't Anything was released in the United Kingdom on 21 November 1988 by Creation Records. A limited edition of the first five thousand vinyl copies pressed included a bonus 7-inch single, featuring two instrumental tracks, both titled \\"Instrumental\\". The B-side track featured a Public Enemy drum loop from \\"Security of the First World\\". In the United States, the album was released by Relativity Records, with international distribution handled by Sire Records in Canada, Virgin Records in France, Rough Trade Records in Germany, and Stiletto Records in Brazil. Isn't Anythings lead single \\"Feed Me with Your Kiss\\" was released in October 1988, backed with three outtakes from the album's recording sessions: \\"I Believe\\", \\"Emptiness Inside\\", and \\"I Need No Trust\\". \\"Soft as Snow (But Warm Inside)\\" was also released as a promotional single in the United States in December 1988. Neither of the album's retail singles charted. The album was reissued on CD by Warner Bros. Records in 1993 and 2001 and by Creation in 1996. A 180-gram LP version of the album was released by Plain Records in 2008, and a remastered version of the album was released in June 2008. An additional remaster by Shields at Metropolis Studios in London was released on 4 May 2012. Reception Upon its release, Isn't Anything received acclaim from critics. A 1988 year-end roundup of the year's top albums in Melody Maker ranked Isn't Anything third of the year and called it “a raving nymphomania and out-of-body experience [that] establishes them as absent-minded rulers of this daydream nation.\\" AllMusic editor Heather Phares referred to the album as \\"the most lucid, expansive articulation yet of the group's sound\\" and said the album \\"captures My Bloody Valentine's revolutionary style in its infancy and points the way to Loveless, but it's far more than just a dress rehearsal for the band's moment of greatness\\", awarding the album four and a half stars out of five. Entertainment Weekly reviewer Ken Tucker reflected on Isn't Anything in 1993, gave the album an A– rating and said the \\"rafter-shaking guitar chords, the baleful vocals -- attests to their faith in romance, betrayal, and dizzy crushes. They nearly bury their somber melodies beneath surface noise. But unearthing the tunes is part of the listening pleasure.\\" The remasters of Isn't Anything also generated favourable reviews, with Uncuts Stephen Troussé said \\"in rock algebra you might deduce that they'd worked out some new equation involving the barbed languor of the Mary Chain, the speedfreak urgency of Sonic Youth, and a dash of The Vaselines' sauce – but none of that accounts for the savagely sensual results.\\" Isn't Anything has subsequently become regarded as one of the greatest albums of the 1980s. The album has been included in The Guardians list of \\"1000 Albums to Hear Before You Die\\" and ranked as number 16 in their \\"Alternative Top 100 Albums\\" list. Archived from the original. The album was also ranked number 24 in The Irish Times list of \\"Top 40 Irish Albums of All Time\\", selected by Pitchfork staff as number 22 on their \\"Top 100 Albums of the 1980s\\" list, and listed at number 92 on Slant Magazines list of \\"Best Albums of the 1980s\\". Uncut writer David Stubbs has called Isn't Anything \\"one of the most important, influential British rock albums of the eighties\\". In its 2013 update, the NME ranked the album at 187 in its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Pitchfork selected the album as the 4th best shoegaze album of all time.

Each relaxation process can be categorized by a relaxation time τ. The simplest theoretical description of relaxation as function of time t is an exponential law exp(-t/τ) (exponential decay). In simple linear systems =Mechanics: Damped unforced oscillator= Let the homogeneous differential equation: :m\\\\frac{d^2 y}{d t^2}+\\\\gamma\\\\frac{d y}{d t}+ky=0 model damped unforced oscillations of a weight on a spring. The displacement will then be of the form y(t) = A e^{-t/T} \\\\cos(\\\\mu t - \\\\delta). The constant T is called the relaxation time of the system and the constant μ is the quasi-frequency. =Electronics: RC circuit= In an RC circuit containing a charged capacitor and a resistor, the voltage decays exponentially: : V(t)=V_0 e^{-\\\\frac{t}{RC}} \\\\ , The constant \\\\tau = RC\\\\ is called the relaxation time or RC time constant of the circuit. A nonlinear oscillator circuit which generates a repeating waveform by the repetitive discharge of a capacitor through a resistance is called a relaxation oscillator. In condensed matter physics In condensed matter physics, relaxation is usually studied as a linear response to a small external perturbation. Since the underlying microscopic processes are active even in the absence of external perturbations, one can also study \\"relaxation in equilibrium\\" instead of the usual \\"relaxation into equilibrium\\" (see fluctuation-dissipation theorem). =Stress relaxation= In continuum mechanics, stress relaxation is the gradual disappearance of stresses from a viscoelastic medium after it has been deformed. =Dielectric relaxation time= In dielectric materials, the dielectric polarization P depends on the electric field E. If E changes, P(t) reacts: the polarization relaxes towards a new equilibrium. It is important in dielectric spectroscopy. Very long relaxation times are responsible for dielectric absorption. The dielectric relaxation time is closely related to the electrical conductivity. In a semiconductor it is a measure of how long it takes to become neutralized by conduction process. This relaxation time is small in metals and can be large in semiconductors and insulators. =Liquids and amorphous solids= An amorphous solid, such as amorphous indomethacin displays a temperature dependence of molecular motion, which can be quantified as the average relaxation time for the solid in a metastable supercooled liquid or glass to approach the molecular motion characteristic of a crystal. Differential scanning calorimetry can be used to quantify enthalpy change due to molecular structural relaxation. The term \\"structural relaxation\\" was introduced in the scientific literature in 1947/48 without any explanation, applied to NMR, and meaning the same as \\"thermal relaxation\\".Kittel, Rep. Prog. Phys. 1947; Hall, Phys. Rev. 1948; Wintner Phys. Rev. 1948. =Spin relaxation in NMR= In nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), various relaxations are the properties that it measures. Chemical relaxation methods In chemical kinetics, relaxation methods are used for the measurement of very fast reaction rates. A system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by a rapid change in a parameter such as the temperature (most commonly), the pressure, the electric field or the pH of the solvent. The return to equilibrium is then observed, usually by spectroscopic means, and the relaxation time measured. In combination with the chemical equilibrium constant of the system, this enables the determination of the rate constants for the forward and reverse reactions.Atkins P. and de Paula J. Atkins' Physical Chemistry (8th ed., W.H.Freeman 2006) p.805-7, = Monomolecular first-order reversible reaction = A monomolecular, first order reversible reaction which is close to equilibrium can be visualized by the following symbolic structure: A ->[k] B ->[k'] A A <=> B In other words, reactant A and product B are forming into one another based on reaction rate constants k and k'. To solve for the concentration of A, recognize that the forward reaction (A ->[{k}] B) causes the concentration of A to decrease over time, whereas the reverse reaction (B ->[{k'}] A) causes the concentration of A to increase over time. Therefore, {d[A] \\\\over dt} = -k[A]+k'[B], where brackets around A and B indicate concentrations. If we say that at t = 0, [A(t)] = [A]_0, and applying the law of conservation of mass, we can say that at any time, the sum of the concentrations of A and B must be equal to the concentration of A_0, assuming the volume into which A and B are dissolved does not change: [A] + [B] = [A]_0 \\\\Rightarrow [B] = [A]_0 - [A] Substituting this value for [B] in terms of A(0) and A(t) yields {d[A] \\\\over dt} = -k[A] + k'[B] = -k[A]+k'([A]_0-[A]) = -(k + k')[A] + k'[A]_0, which becomes the separable differential equation {1 \\\\over -(k + k')[A] + k'[A]_0}d[A] = dt This equation can be solved by substitution to yield [A] = {k'-ke^{-(k+k')t} \\\\over k+k'}[A]_0 In atmospheric sciences =Desaturation of clouds= Consider a supersaturated portion of a cloud. Then shut off the updrafts, entrainment, and any other vapor sources/sinks and things that would induce the growth of the particles (ice or water). Then wait for this supersaturation to reduce and become just saturation (relative humidity = 100%), which is the equilibrium state. The time it takes for the supersaturation to dissipate is called relaxation time. It will happen as ice crystals or liquid water content grow within the cloud and will thus consume the contained moisture. The dynamics of relaxation are very important in cloud physics for accurate mathematical modelling. In water clouds where the concentrations are larger (hundreds per cm3) and the temperatures are warmer (thus allowing for much lower supersaturation rates as compared to ice clouds), the relaxation times will be very low (seconds to minutes). In ice clouds the concentrations are lower (just a few per liter) and the temperatures are colder (very high supersaturation rates) and so the relaxation times can be as long as several hours. Relaxation time is given as :T = (4π DNRK )−1 seconds, where: *D = diffusion coefficient [m2/s] *N = concentration (of ice crystals or water droplets) [m−3] *R = mean radius of particles [m] *K = capacitance [unitless].  In astronomy In astronomy, relaxation time relates to clusters of gravitationally interacting bodies, for instance, stars in a galaxy. The relaxation time is a measure of the time it takes for one object in the system (the \\"test star\\") to be significantly perturbed by other objects in the system (the \\"field stars\\"). It is most commonly defined as the time for the test star's velocity to change by of order itself. Suppose that the test star has velocity v. As the star moves along its orbit, its motion will be randomly perturbed by the gravitational field of nearby stars. The relaxation time can be shown to be : T_r = {0.34\\\\sigma^3\\\\over G^2 m\\\\rho\\\\ln\\\\Lambda} : \\\\approx 0.95\\\\times 10^{10} \\\\\\\\!\\\\left({\\\\sigma\\\\over 200\\\\,\\\\mathrm{km\\\\,s}^{-1}}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!3} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left({\\\\rho\\\\over 10^6\\\\,M_\\\\odot\\\\,\\\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!-1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left({m_\\\\star\\\\over M_\\\\odot}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!-1} \\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!\\\\left({\\\\ln\\\\Lambda\\\\over 15}\\\\right)^{\\\\\\\\!-1}\\\\\\\\!\\\\mathrm{yr} where ρ is the mean density, m is the test- star mass, σ is the 1d velocity dispersion of the field stars, and ln Λ is the Coulomb logarithm. Various events occur on timescales relating to the relaxation time, including core collapse, energy equipartition, and formation of a Bahcall-Wolf cusp around a supermassive black hole.

Lake Avenue is a major north–south feeder road for the Pasadena and Altadena communities in Los Angeles County, California. The road was developed in the mid 19th century and takes its name from a lake which was located at its southernmost end known variously as Mission Lake, Kewen Lake, and Wilson Lake reflecting different owners of the land. The lake bed still exists as a municipal park (Lacy Park) in the City of San Marino just south of the Raymond Dike, but it holds no water. It has been surrounded by residences who are served by a crisscross set of roads that dip into the edges of impression and back out the other side. Lake Avenue is approximately in length. Transportation Metro Local lines 180 and 258 run on Lake Avenue: the former starts at Colorado Boulevard and the latter through most of Lake Avenue. An Metro L Line station is located at Interstate 210 under Lake Avenue.  In Altadena  The northernmost end of the road lies at the very foot of the San Gabriel Mountains in Altadena and immediately accesses Las Flores Canyon. The first resident of Las Flores Canyon was the Forsyth Ranch. It sold in 1919 to Mr. Cobb who had an enormous and fascinating estate on the alluvial fan which emanates from the Canyon. Las Flores was also known for its small and short-lived gold mining operations there. The Cobb Estate was deeded to the United States Forest Service as a free growth Arboretum in 1967. The gates on Lake Avenue mark the entrance to the estate which still has its long, paved, curving driveway which leads to the site of the defunct manor. The adjacent trailhead of the Sam Merrill Trail also leads into the canyon from Lake Avenue. This is the origin of the local term \\"top of Lake,\\" which refers to the northernmost neighborhoods. In the days of the Red Car in Altadena (1902–1941), Lake Avenue was known as the short line, or Oak Knoll line. Oak Knoll is the street into which Lake Avenue transitions with a slow curve to the right and then back to the left. The Pacific Electric cars came up from a switch on the Huntington Drive line below the famous hotel of the same name. The “short line” was a shorter way to get to Lake and Mariposa in Altadena without having to ride the circuitous route up Fair Oaks Avenue. In 1914 a spur on the short line was built across Mendocino Street from Lake Ave. to Allen St. and the development of Country Club Parks. The line was put there to access the new development and the Altadena Country Club and Golf Course.  In Pasadena  The Hat on Lake Lake Avenue was originally named Lake Vineyard Avenue after the ranch of the same name (on which the lake mentioned above was located) on which the street was partially located. Lake Avenue is located centrally to Pasadena and is the East West divider of the city; Fair Oaks Avenue and Colorado Boulevard mark the postal center of town (0e/w, 0n/s) where its downtown section had originally developed. This postal division carries through into Altadena. However, Lake defines County Road Division No. 5 (West) from County Road Division No. 4 (East). Lake Avenue defines the eastern boundary of the original Woodbury Ranch purchase of . In Pasadena, Lake Avenue serves a great number of business districts and is relatively free of residential addresses, though some still exist from earlier times. Well known to locals is the South Lake Avenue Business District which runs south from Green Street to California Boulevard, about in length.

Russell Ohl’s specialized area of research was into the behavior of certain types of crystals. He worked on materials research in the 1930s at AT&T;'s Bell Labs’ Holmdel facility, investigating diode detectors suitable for high-frequency wireless, broadcasting, and military radar. His work was only understood by a handful of scientists in the organization, one of whom was Dr. Walter Brattain (one of the trio who invented the germanium bipolar transistor in 1947, and who would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1956). Ohl, in 1939, discovered the PN barrier (or as it became known, the “P–N junction”).\\"Silicon P-N Junction\\". 1999, ScienCentral Inc. and American Institute of Physics, Retrieved on October 6, 2010 At the time hardly anyone knew anything about the impurities within these crystals, but Russell Ohl discovered the mechanism by which it worked.

New Opportunities in Adult Education and How to Avoid Being Ripped Off by 'Christian' Degree Mills 4th ed. History In 1979, Patriot University was established at the Dallas, Texas, home of school founder Lonnie Skinner. Then in 1985 it became affiliated with the now defunct Hilltop Baptist Church in Colorado Springs and became \\"an external studies mission of Hilltop Baptist Church.\\" Beginning in March 1988,According to the document on Patriot's website, they first gained approval in March 1988. the State of Colorado Higher Education Commission gave Patriot \\"Religious Authorization\\", which they define as \\"[a] bona fide religious postsecondary educational institution which is exempt from property taxation under the laws of this state and whose degrees or diplomas have no state recognition\\". In 1993, its address was listed as 6915 Palmer Park Blvd in Colorado Springs with Wayne Knight as President and Director. This is the address of Hilltop Baptist Church, which was founded in the late 1970s by Bill Knight; the current pastor is his son Franklin “Wayne” Knight. The current PBU president is Wayne Knight and Bill Knight is PBU chancellor. In 1993, admission requirements included that applicants must be \\"Bible believing Christians.\\" In 1997, Patriot's street address was also listed as the residential address of Lonnie Skinner. In 2004, Skinner, previously a student at the unaccredited Baptist Christian College, \\"announced his early retirement (at age 56) as pastor of College Heights Baptist Church\\" after nine years. In July 2004, the school changed its name to Patriot Bible University and moved out of College Heights Baptist Church and into a building in Del Norte, Colorado, a small town of 1,700 people. According to property records, Hilltop Baptist Church bought the Patriot building, which was valued at $232,495; it currently has a tax exemption.Riogrande County Record Search As of 2007, Patriot's Del Norte address is listed by Zabasearch.com and usrdir.com as the residence of Lonnie Skinner and the Skinner family (Lonnie, Toni, and possibly Rachael). In 2006, Patriot wrote that \\"Hilltop Baptist Church of Colorado Springs is our sponsoring organization.\\" Also in 2006, it said it had about 400 active, distance learning based students, and issued approximately 50 to 100 Christian religious degrees (Bachelor's, Master's and Doctorates) per year. In 2007, it had a total of four employees. In November 2011, PBU's President and Hilltop Baptist pastor Wayne Knight was arrested on four counts alleging that he knew about his niece molesting a child at Hilltop Baptist School, but \\"failed to comply with a state law requiring them to report it to law enforcement\\". According to court affidavits, Knight \\"displayed a consistent pattern to manipulate and control the situation—not only among the faculty at Hilltop Baptist School—but also among parent , church members and students\\" and \\"[t]he pastor also allegedly lied about having conducted a lie detector test.\\" Also in November 2011, Hilltop Baptist Church was sued by parents and teachers who reported cases of sex abuse to Knight, who told the employees he had \\"previous knowledge about the matter and promised to investigate,\\" but instead fired the employees a month later. In February 2012, Knight took a plea deal where he \\"pleaded guilty to being an accessory to a crime and failure to report suspected child abuse,\\" and planned to move to Texas. In 2010, Hilltop Baptist School closed after enrollment dropped. In 2012, Hilltop Baptist Church was closed and its website was no longer online. In 2013, the teacher pleaded guilty to sexual assault. Accreditation Profile view of Patriot Bible University taken on November 22, 2006. In Name It and Frame It? New Opportunities in Adult Education and How to Avoid Being Ripped Off by 'Christian' Degree Mills, Steve Levicoff explained that while a non-accredited school is not necessarily a degree mill, Patriot Bible University is a degree mill. The college has varied its policies over the years, but it has been criticized for awarding students degrees based on questionable standards such as \\"life experience\\" or \\"ministry evaluation\\" that lack academic rigour and merit. The university is not accredited by any recognized accreditation associations of higher learning. As of 2007, it was recognized by the American Accrediting Association of Theological Institutions (AAATI), which itself has no recognition from the United States Department of Education or any other government educational organization. The AAATI is itself considered an accreditation mill, and provides approval to schools for a $100 charge. In October 2008, it was accredited by Accrediting Commission International.\\"Patriot Bible University is authorized by the State of Colorado to grant religious degrees and (as of October 2008) is accredited by the Accrediting Commission International.\\" from The ACI is again not recognized by the US Department of Education. The St. Petersburg Times reported, \\"Alan Contreras, who heads Oregon's Office of Degree Authorization, which closely tracks schools with questionable accreditation. 'Anything accredited by ACI in Beebe, Ark., is either fake or substandard, as far as I know.'\\" Tuition, requirements, and criticism Close up profile view of Patriot Bible University taken on November 22, 2006. Critics have charged that Patriot Bible University is a diploma mill as it has unreasonably low graduation requirements, lack of sufficient faculty or educational standards, and a suspicious tuition scheme, among other issues. The college itself has claimed that it simply does not \\"choose\\" to be accredited by standard associations. The school's current policies allow students with previous college credits to attain bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and even \\"Doctor of Ministry\\" degrees in months, rather than years, for as little as $38 per month plus books. The university offers a monthly fee, unlike most universities, which only charge per-credit fees. Patriot allows students to \\"prepay\\" for degrees (such as, D.Min. fully pre-paid, $1899) and for those who already have a degree they \\"are required to complete only 12 courses for the Bachelor of Arts level\\". It has offered buyer discounts, such as \\"when you place an order for four courses at one time, one of them will be free!\\" The school's catalog contains course descriptions but no listing of the school's faculty or their credentials. The school teaches young-earth creationism.Which universities, colleges, and seminaries teach a literal Genesis, including six-day, young- earth Creation? Patriot Bible University is divided into three schools—College of Ministerial Studies, College of Christian Education, and Patriot School of the Bible. The College of Ministerial Studies and College of Christian Education offer Christian Bible degrees at the undergraduate and graduate degree levels. Patriot School of the Bible offers Bible diplomas, certifications, ministry and leadership training, and continuing education. =Kent Hovind= Much of the criticism of Patriot is leveled at the controversial creationist evangelist Kent Hovind, who received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Patriot in 1989 and 1991, both in Christian Education. Hovind's use of the title Doctor in particular has provoked interest and subsequently, scrutiny of his education credentials as well as his dissertation. Doctoral dissertations from reputable institutions are published by the awarding institution and generally lodged with university libraries, as well as being made available to other scholars conducting research in similar areas. However, Patriot will not supply copies of Hovind's doctoral dissertation except with his permission. Karen Bartelt, an organic chemistry professor who debated Hovind, wrote that she viewed a copy on file at the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), but the organization cannot distribute it due to copyright restrictions. The NCSE's copy was received from Skip Evans who obtained Hovind's dissertation from Patriot with Hovind's permission in March 1999. Critics have described Hovind's dissertation as incomplete, of low academic quality, poorly written, poor in spelling, and of ungrammatical style. The lack of quality was ascribed, in part, to the fact that \\"the pages are not numbered; there is no title; of sixteen or so chapters in the index only the first four are finished; misspellings are rampant (immerged for emerged, epic for epoch, and tentable for testable are three examples); and the single illustration was apparently cut out of a science book with scissors and fastened to the thesis with glue or tape.\\" Hovind's dissertation was approved by one person, Wayne Knight, who was and remains president of Patriot. Patriot has posted Hovind's religious testimony on its website and posted a defense of him. In Patriot's school catalog, Hovind is quoted as saying \\"It was the study for my dissertation that opened so many doors of opportunity for me to preach.\\" In 2010, Patriot responded to WikiLeaks' posting of Hovind's dissertation. Patriot wrote the posting was not the \\"finished\\" product, but because they do not \\"retain ownership to student thesis' or dissertations, as is commonly practiced by many schools,\\" they \\"cannot release student work to the public\\". In 2007, Hovind was sentenced to ten years in federal prison and in 2013, Hovind self-published a new dissertation while in prison for an unaccredited Doctor of Ministry degree from Patriot, which according to Hovind, was presented in \\"simple 4th grade style.\\" It is titled What On Earth Is About To Happen ... For Heaven's Sake?: A Dissertation on End Times According to the Bible, and claims that the second coming will happen in 2028.

Early years An ancient relief from the temple of thumb Yasovarman was a son of King Indravarman I and his wife Indradevi.Some Aspects of Asian History and Culture by Upendra Thakur. Page 37. Yaasovarman was said to be a wrestler. Inscriptions say he was capable of wrestling with elephants. The inscriptions also say he was capable of slaying tigers with his bare hands. His teacher was the Brahman Vamasiva, part of the Devaraja cult priesthood. Vamasiva's master, Sivasoma, was connected to the Hindu philosopher Adi Shankara. After the death of Indravarman, a succession war was fought by his two sons, Yasovarman and his brother. It is believed that the war was fought on land and on sea by the Tonlé Sap. In the end Yasovarman prevailed. Because of his father had sought to deny his accession, according to inscriptions cited by L.P. Briggs, \\"Yasovarman I ignored his claim to the throne through his father, Indravarman I, or through Jayavarman II, the founder of Angkor dynasty, and built up an elaborate family tree, connecting himself through his mother with ancient kings of Funan and Chenla.\\"Briggs, The Ancient Khmer Empire; page 105. Yasovarman I claims to be a descendant of the ruling clans of Sambhupura, Aniditapura, Vyadhapura. This was found on 12 different stone inscriptions located in different parts of the country.Briggs, L. P. (1951). The Ancient Khmer Empire. American Philosophical Society, 41(1), page 61. Yasovarman I led a failed invasion of Champa, as documented at Banteay Chmar.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., Yasovarman I’s achievements During the first year of his reign, he built about 100 monasteries (ashrams) throughout his kingdom. Each ashram was used as a resting place for the ascetic and the king during his trips. In 893 he began to construct the Indratataka Baray (reservoir) that was started by his father. In the middle of this lake (now dry), he built the temple Lolei.Jessup, p.77; Freeman and Jacques, pp.202 ff. Yasovarman was one of the great Angkorian kings. His greatest achievement was to move the capital from Hariharalaya to Yashodharapura where it remained there for 600 years. It was at this new capital where all of the great and famous religious monuments were built, e.g. the Angkor Wat. There were many reasons for the move. The old capital was crowded with temples built by the previous kings. Thus, the decision was religious: In order for a new king to prosper, he must build his own temple and when he died it must become his mausoleum. Second, the new capital was closer to the Siem Reap River and is halfway between the Kulen hills and the Tonlé Sap. By moving the capital closer to the sources of water the king could reap many benefits provided by both rivers. Yashodharapura was built on a low hill called Bakheng, and connected to Hariharalaya by a causeway. Simultaneously, he started to dig a huge reservoir at his new capital.

In 704 Justinian II, who had been exiled at Chersonesos for nine years, arrived at Busir's court. Busir, perhaps seeking to use him in his political maneuverings with the Byzantine Empire, welcomed Justinian and gave him his sister in marriage (the woman's Khazar name is unknown, but she took the baptismal name of Theodora). Busir provided the couple with funds and a house in Phanagoria. However, the winds of realpolitik soon shifted, and the new emperor, Tiberius III, offered Busir a substantial bounty for his brother-in-law's head. Busir dispatched two agents, Balgitzin and Papatzys, to kill Justinian, but the latter was warned by his wife, who bribed the assassins' slaves to learn the nature of their mission. Turning the tables on his would-be killers, Justinian murdered the pair after a banquet and fled Phanagoria by ship, seeking aid from Khan Terval of Bulgaria, with whose help he retook Constantinople. Busir now attempted to make peace with Justinian, sending Theodora to Constantinople. He later became involved with, possibly instigating, a revolt by Justinian's officers in the Crimea, which led ultimately to the crowning of Philippikos Bardanes as emperor and the death of Justinian in 711.

She is a teenage member of the student body at the Xavier Institute and a recurring member of the X-Men. Publication history Mercury first appeared in New Mutants, vol. 2 #2 in August 2003. Fictional character biography =Introduction= Cessily Kincaid, an Irish American, was raised in Portland, Oregon by her parents Mark and Jill, who, according to DeFilippis, used to dote over her. When Cessily's powers manifested, her parents were disgusted and made her stay indoors so as to hide her mutation. In response, she was sent to the Xavier Institute where she befriended Julian Keller and was placed as Laurie Collins' roommate for a while. After the school was rebuilt, she was selected by Emma Frost to be on her Hellions squad. She's extremely close to Santo Varroco and Julian Keller whom she spends most of her time with and looks upon like big brothers. During that time, she developed a crush on her teammate Wither, but her feelings were not reciprocated. =Hellions Miniseries= The Hellions squad won the squad challenge, and during their summer vacation, they travelled with Julian to his home. There they encountered the Kingmaker, from whom they each received a trial wish. Cessily's wish was to have her parents accept and love her, a wish the Kingmaker granted by manipulating her parents with telepaths. When the Hellions eventually refused a permanent deal with the Kingmaker, Cessily's parents reverted to normal and Cessily returned to the Institute, defeated. =Decimation= After the events of M-Day only 27 students were left with their powers, including Cessily, although she would have preferred to lose her powers and was devastated that she did not. The depowered students and staff were sent home. One bus was bombed by anti-mutant religious zealot Reverend William Stryker, and Cessily's former teammate and friend Tag was among those killed. The X-Men held a funeral for those students whose parents would not accept them, and Cessily's anguish was very visible. All of the remaining students were placed by Emma Frost into an all-out brawl, and the ones deemed to be the best were to be assigned to become a group of in-training X-Men. Cessily made the team and began training to become an X-Man. =Childhood's End and Nimrod= In the Childhood's End arc, Cessily and the New X-Men defeated Stryker, Josh killing him. Shortly afterwards the team went to help Forge who had been sought out by Nimrod for repair. During the skirmish X-23 was forced to sever a piece of Mercury's hand to separate her from Nimrod. She later commented she'd \\"always wanted to lose a few pounds.\\" The team successfully defeated the robot due to combining the powers of Surge, Mercury, and X-23 and Nimrod was sent back in time. =Mercury Falling= After learning of Emma Frost's plan to have X-23 leave the school, Cessily takes Laura to Salem Center for coffee to cool Laura down. Just as Cessily realizes that Laura has feelings for Hellion, the coffee shop explodes. Facility agents led by Laura's former handler, Kimura come for one of them. Laura, believing it is her, begs Cessily to leave, but not before Kimura shoots Cessily with an electric bullet, incapacitating her. After capturing Cessily, Kimura leaves before Laura can recuperate from a grenade blast. At the lab, Cessily questions who they are and what they want but is given no answers. When she replies that her friends will come for her, Kimura informs that \\"The Elephant\\" (Mammomax) said the same thing while showing a picture of his corpse in a cell. Before dying, Stryker had requested a living weapon be made, a huge beast called Predator X. Mercury's metal skin was needed to give it added powers and durability. The Facility scientists strip some of Mercury's biometal, granting Predator X her powers. The experiments leave her physically and mentally traumatized, forcing her to recuperate for some time at the Institute. She eventually regains some of her lost mass. =Quest for Magik= Mercury is recovering in bed after what happened to her in the last arc when the students are teleported to Limbo. She is held captive by Belasco but breaks free after he 'kills' X-23. She and Dust go up against Belasco and keep getting beaten down but refuse to give up, as both their mutant bodies are resistant to his magic and fight an inconclusive battle until Darkchylde and the other students arrive, teleported by Pixie. Mercury continues to fight alongside the other students, but can only watch as Belasco fends them off and proceeds to pull Earth into Limbo until he is defeated by Darkchylde and Pixie. =World War Hulk= Mercury is one of the students that intercepts the Hulk. Mercury helps in keeping Hulk pinned down in the first attack but is knocked away. When X-23 blinds him she joins in taking him down alongside Surge, Beast and X-23 but they are all knocked away when Hulk's eyes grow back. Mercury gets back up and attacks him from behind but Hulk grabs her and squishes her against the ground. Later while the rest of the X-Men are still defeated from the Hulk's attack, Mercury tries one more time to defeat the rampaging green goliath. During the course of the battle, the Hulk was shown the recent graveyards of all of the deceased mutants that died after M-Day. Mercury then describes in detail the deaths of Laurie Collins and Brian Cruz, causing the Hulk to understand his self-righteous tantrum is wrongly directed towards Xavier's affiliation with the Illuminati. Seeing these graveyards reminds the Hulk of his fallen companions on Sakaar, and with that understanding, he leaves Xavier unharmed. =Children of X-Men= Cessily still maintains her disapproval and distrust of Emma Frost after overhearing her conversation with X-23 during the \\"Mercury Falling\\" arc. She also feels that Emma has carelessly \\"lost\\" track of Wither and constantly reminds her of the fact that Kevin is no longer in the school or under her surveillance. Mercury has also been deeply affected by the events of Decimation, as depicted in the \\"Endangered Species\\" miniseries. She is distraught by the death of a teenage civilian mutant and is one of the students at the institute trying to determine the youngest mutant, as she believes that the youngest mutant always tends to be killed. Mercury later comforts X-23 after she ran off and wrecked the woman's restroom in rage due to Surge kissing Hellion, and is later seen hanging out with her and Dust. =Messiah Complex= Mercury is one of the New X-Men led by Surge that launch a strike against the Purifiers to incapacitate them and rescue the mutant baby. After Hellion is critically wounded by Lady Deathstrike, Pixie panics and blindly teleports the entire team out of the Purifiers' base, spreading them out between Washington and New York. It does not appear that Cessily suffered any lasting injuries as a result. Iceman arrives with the X-Jet to bring them back to the mansion. She helps to stabilize Hellion in the X-Jet on the way back to the mansion. Later, she goes with Dust and Rockslide to visit the graveyard, and they discover that Predator X has entered the mansion grounds. Mercury battles the monster with the rest of the students and is transported by Pixie, along with the other New X-Men, to the battle between the X-Teams and Sinister's forces on Muir Isle. =Secret Invasion= Cessily is among the several X-Men helping to fight off Skrulls during their invasion of San Francisco.Secret Invasion: X-Men #1 =Manifest Destiny= Mercury and X-23 are walking down Fisherman's Wharf when X-23 realizes Mercury is upset. Mercury misses her parents and feels like a freak because they were disgusted when her powers manifested. While playing with Silly Putty, she comments: They are then attacked by 3 members of the Hellfire Cult and Mercury takes them all out. X-23 points out she is more than just lifeless metal, she is a person and a hero and to put her past behind her and look at who she is now. She just might like what she sees. =X-Infernus= Mercury and Rockslide are watching a training session between Pixie and Nightcrawler when Pixie stabs Kurt with her soul dagger. They run in and move Pixie away from Kurt's unconscious body, Beast enters and Pixie regains her senses. When she removes her dagger, Magik's soulsword emerges from his chest and Magik teleports in ready to reclaim her sword.X-Infernus #1 Mercury engages Magik in combat and manages to stab her in the shoulder; Illyana responds by blowing her up, noting that she has some immunity to magic, but is not invulnerable. After she reforms, she is placed on a team of X-Men being sent to Limbo along with Rockslide due to their resistance to magic. Upon entering Limbo, the team fights their way through many demons. Pixie senses the darkness within her suddenly growing and she teleports off to Belasco's castle by herself. Hearing the screams from the castle, Kurt teleports the X-Men into the throne room. Once there, Witchfire turns Colossus and Wolverine against Mercury and Rockslide who get taken out, leaving Kurt the last X-Man standing.X-Infernus #3 =Utopia= Mercury, along with fellow students Onyxx and Loa, was tasked with keeping peace at the riots on Telegraph Hill after the mutant-hate group \\"Humanity Now!\\" marched from Sacramento to San Francisco to promote \\"Proposition X\\", displeasing many citizens of San Francisco, mutant and non-mutant alike. After the riots subsided on Telegraph Hill, Cyclops came and picked them up, taking them to City Hall.Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Utopia #1 During the final battle against Norman Osborn's forces, along with Iceman and many of the other x-students, she takes on Mimic.Dark Avengers / Uncanny X-Men: Exodus #1 After Osborn's defeat by the X-Men and the official creation of Utopia, Mercury is involved in a media tug of war between Norman Osborn, her biological father and their claims that she is being held captive against her will. Although she confronts her father over the phone, during a live television broadcast, and disputes his claims going as far as to call him a bad father her situation gets more complicated as Deadpool intervenes. Believing that he is doing them a favor he attempts to kill Mr. Kincaid on live television only to be stopped by Domino. However Deadpool is still attempting to follow through and kill Mercury's father. In the meantime, the X-Men plan on having Mercury declared an emancipated minor in order to counter Osborn. Kincaid is later saved from sniper fire in front the media by Wolverine, thus restoring the X-Men's damaged reputations. He confesses in an interview to the aforementioned witnesses that Norman Osborn put him up to everything.Deadpool #16-18 (2010) The following storyline created some continuity errors as it was implied that Mr. Kincaid had been an absentee father for most of Mercury's life, and it also implied that he was divorced/separated from Mercury's mother. This is in direct conflict from the Hellion's mini-series which showed both Mercury's parents living together happily. Furthermore, in a New X-Men flashback during the Mercury Rising storyline it showed a concerned father discovering Cessily during the onset of her mutation. =Regenesis= Cessily left with Wolverine and returned to the school.X-Men: Regenesis #1 In the first issue of Wolverine and the X-Men: Alpha & Omega, she is seen at school. Powers and abilities 200px Mercury's body is composed of a non-toxic metal resembling mercury, which she can reshape or solidify at will, although she is still inexperienced in shape-shifting. Molecular adhesion power gives her the ability to cling to solid surfaces and move her body at will even without overt locomotive features. She has also demonstrated superhuman strength by supporting huge slabs of concrete, though the extent of this strength is unknown. It has also been said by her creators that she can potentially do anything the T-1000, from 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, can. However, she has yet to demonstrate one key facet of the T-1000's shapeshifting—the ability to change the color and texture of her liquid metal to completely mimic a human form. Mercury often maintains her original red hair, suggesting that she has the ability to change her mercury's color and texture to a degree. Electricity is her main weakness and has often been used against her, because it causes her body interference. Due to her composition Mercury does not require food or drink. Only a few people know this, as Mercury \\"eats\\" to make herself feel more normal and to be able to interact with other people. Since her body is not organic, she is one of the few people who can touch Wither - for whom she has unrequited feelings - without decaying. Her inorganic body also made her immune to the pheromone based powers of Wallflower and was placed as her roommate. She can also control pieces of her liquid mercury and has the potential to bring it back to her like she almost did in the last issue of Mercury Falling. Usually, if forcefully separated from her body, her liquid mercury turns into dead flesh, as demonstrated during the Facility's experiments. Some of her mercury has been separated as living mercury tissue and was used for Predator X's skin. She is currently less than her original mass, as she states that when Laura cut off her hands to save her during the fight with Nimrod, she \\"lost a few pounds.\\" Due to her transient form, she has some resistance to magic.X-Infernus #2New X-Men (2nd Series) #39 Other versions =House of M= * In the House of M reality, Cessily was a student at Karma's New Mutant Leadership Institute, and, unlike her 616 persona, was close with Laurie. When she learned of Prodigy's plan to help Surge find her terrorist father in Japan, she was against going, but then Laurie (a deep cover S.H.I.E.L.D. agent) changed her mind. Once in Japan, the young team found the Project Genesis the terrorists were trying to stop, and Laurie revealed her loyalties, making the Hellions attack the New Mutants. Mercury, however, was immune to pheromones, and pleaded with her friend to stop. When Laurie refused, Cessily was forced to stab her in the abdomen. Afterwards, Mercury joined the survivors in a last-ditch assault on Emperor Sunfire's forces.New X-Men: Academy X #16–19 In other media =Television= * Mercury appears in the Wolverine and the X-Men episodes \\"Greetings from Genosha\\" and \\"Battle Lines\\" as one of Magneto's Acolytes.

One of 26 similar pieces discovered in a feminine necropolis (\\"Demeter's priestess\\") near Phanagoria. On exhibit at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. Phanagoria () was the largest ancient Greek city on the Taman peninsula, spread over two plateaus along the eastern shore of the Cimmerian Bosporus. The city was a large emporium for all the traffic between the coast of the Maeotian marshes and the countries on the southern side of the Caucasus. It was the eastern capital of the Bosporan Kingdom, with Panticapaeum being the western capital. Strabo described it as a noteworthy city which was renowned for its trade.Strabo, Geographica 11.2.10 Shortly a Catholic Metropolitan Archdiocese while a medieval Genoese colony under the name Matrega, it remains a Latin Catholic titular see. Today the site is located at a short distance to the west of Sennoy in Krasnodar Krai, Russia. Another ancient Greek city, Hermonassa, lies to the west, on the shoreline of modern Taman.  History  = Antiquity = Phanagoria and other ancient Greek colonies along the north coast of the Black Sea, 8th to 3rd century BC Phanagoria was founded ca. 543 BC by the Teian colonists who had to flee Asia Minor in consequence of their conflict with Cyrus the Great. The city took its name after one of these colonists, Phanagoras. \\"The unusual nature of the Taman peninsula near Phanagoria, with its ravines, crevices, hills, and low cones of active volcanoes, must have impressed the ancient colonists even more than it impresses us today\\", Yulia Ustinova has observed.Ustinova, Yulia. The Supreme Gods of the Bosporan Kingdom. Brill Academic Publishers, 1999. p. 61. In the 5th century BC, the town thrived on the trade with the Scythians and Sindi. Located on an island in the ancient archipelago of Corocondamitis, between the Black Sea and the Palus Maeotis, Phanagoria covered an area of of which one third has been submerged by the sea. In the early 4th century BC the burgeoning Bosporan Kingdom subjugated much of Sindica, including the independent polis of Phanagoria. The town's importance increased with the decline of the old capital, Panticapaeum, situated on the opposite shore of the Bosporus. By the first centuries AD, Phanagoria had emerged as the main centre of the kingdom. During the Mithridatic Wars, the town allied with the Roman Republic and withstood a siege by the army of Pharnaces II of Pontus. It was at Phanagoria that the insurrection broke out against Mithridates VI of Pontus, shortly before his death; and his sons, who held the citadel, were obliged to surrender to the insurgents. An inscription found during excavations testifies that Queen Dynamis honored Augustus as \\"the emperor, Caesar, son of a god, the god Augustus, the overseer of every land and sea\\".D. Kendall, G. O'Collins, S. T. Davis. The Trinity. Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 30. The loyalty to Rome allowed Phanagoria to maintain a dominant position in the region until the 4th century, when it was sacked and destroyed by the invading Huns. = Middle Ages = By the 7th century, the town had recovered from a century of barbarian invasions. It served as the capital of Old Great Bulgaria between 632 and 665 under Kubrat. Afterwards Phanagoria became (at least nominally) a Byzantine dependency. A Khazar tudun was nonetheless present in the town and de facto control probably rested in Khazar hands until the defeat of Georgius Tzul in 1016. In 704, the deposed Byzantine emperor Justinian II settled in Phanagoria (then governed by the Khazar tudun Balgatzin) with his wife Theodora, a sister of the Khazar Khagan Busir Glavan, before returning to Constantinople by way of Bulgaria. In the 10th century, the town seems to have faced an invasion, supposedly by the Rus. After that, Phanagoria could not compete in significance with neighboring Tmutarakan. In the late Middle Ages the town of Matrega was built on its ruins; the site was part of a network of Genoese possessions along the northern Black Sea coast. During the 15th century, it was the center of de Ghisolfi dominions. Henceforth there has been no permanent settlement on the site.  Ecclesiastical history  The Genoese colony was canonically established on 1349.02.21 as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Matriga. It was suppressed around 1400 AD. * Recorded incumbent : Giovanni di Zechia, Friars Minor (O.F.M.) (1349.02.22 – 1363?) = Titular see = The diocese was nominally restored as a Latin Catholic titular bishopric in 1928 under the name Matriga, which was changed in 1929 already to Matrega. It is vacant, having had the following incumbents, all of the lowest (episcopal) rank : * Titular Bishop Teofilius Matulionis (1928.12.08 – 1943.01.09), as Auxiliary Bishop of Mohilev (Belarus) (1928.12.08 – 1943.01.09); later Bishop of Kaišiadorys (Lithuania) (1943.01.09 – 1962.08.20) and on emeritate created Archbishop ad personam (1962.02.09 – death 1962.08.20) * Titular Bishop Rafael González Estrada (1944.05.16 – death 1994.03.07), first as Auxiliary Bishop of Quetzaltenango, Los Altos (Guatemala) (1944.05.16 – 1955), then Auxiliary Bishop of Guatemala (Guatemala) (1955 – emeritate 1984.05.29).  Excavations  Pottery vessel in the shape of Aphrodite inside a shell; from Attica, Classical Greece, discovered in the Phanagoria cemetery, Taman Peninsula (Bosporan Kingdom, southern Russia), 1st quarter of 4th century BC, Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg. The location of Phanagoria was determined in the 18th century, when marble statue bases with dedications to Aphrodite were discovered there. Hecataeus and Strabo mention a local sanctuary of Aphrodite as the largest in the Pontic region. Archaeological exploration of the site started in 1822, when \\"soldiers dug into a large barrow, making rich discoveries of gold and silver objects, many unique, which they divided up between themselves\\".North Pontic Archaeology: Recent Discoveries and Studies (ed. by Gocha R. Tsetskhladze). Brill Academic Publishers, 2001. p. x. Apart from the ancient city itself, archaeologists have been interested in a vast necropolis, which spreads on three sides around Phanagoria. There are thousands of burials, many with cypress or marble sarcophagi — an indication of the well-being of the ancient Phanagorians. Excavations conducted in the 19th century were for the most part amateurish; as many as twelve kurgans would be razed each season. Some of the most intriguing finds were unearthed in the 1860s at the Bolshaya Bliznitsa tumulus, classed by Michael Rostovtzeff as a feminine necropolis with three vaults. One of the royal kurgans near Phanagoria \\"has a stone stairway leading down to a rectangular passageway, the entrance to the burial chamber (3.70 × 3.75 × 4.70 m). These two areas are covered by an arch showing remains of painted decoration. The wall frescos imitate encrusted marble. On either side of the entrance to the tomb long stone boxes contain four horse burials along with rich grave gifts; saddlery and harnesses of gold and gilded bronze.\\"Quoted from The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites.

Kohl ( kuḥl) is an ancient eye cosmetic, traditionally made by grinding stibnite (Sb2S3) for similar purposes to charcoal used in mascara. It is widely used in the Middle East and North Africa, the Mediterranean, South Asia, and the Horn of Africa as eyeliner to contour and/or darken the eyelids and as mascara for the eyelashes. It is worn mostly by women, but also by some men and children. Kohl has also been used in India as a cosmetic for a long time. In addition, mothers would apply kohl to their infants' eyes soon after birth. Some did this to \\"strengthen the child's eyes\\", and others believed it could prevent the child from being cursed by the evil eye.Hardy A, Walton R, Vaishnav R., Int J Environ Health Res. 2004 Feb;14(1):83–91. Composition of eye cosmetics (kohls) used in Cairo. Name Ancient kohl cosmetic tube from western Iran, dated 800-500 BCE. The Arabic name and the Biblical Hebrew Strong's Concordance H3583 (cf. modern Hebrew כחול \\"blue\\") are cognates, from a Semitic root k-ḥ-l. Transliteration variants of Arabic dialectal pronunciation include kohl or kuhl. The English word alcohol is a loan of the Arabic word (via Middle Latin and French; originally in the sense \\"powder of antimony\\", the modern meaning is from the 18th century). The Persian word for kohl is سرمه sormeh, from Turkish sürme \\"drawing along\\", which has led to Bengali and Urdu surma ( সুর্মা, سرمہ) as well as Russian . In some South Asian languages, the term kājal or kajol is used. This last term may originally have a Dravidian root. The Greek and Latin terms for antimony, stibium, στίβι, στίμμι, were borrowed from the Egyptian name . In Hausa, it is also known as tozali and kwalli.Kay Lazar Folk remedy linked to baby’s high lead levels, Boston Globe, 2 August 2012. Middle East and North Africa 18th Dynasty Ancient Egyptian kohl container inscribed for Queen Tiye (1410–1372 BCE). Kohl has been worn traditionally since the Protodynastic Period of Egypt (ca. 3100 BCE) by Egyptian queens and noble women, who used stibnite (the sulfide of antimony rather than of lead). The cosmetic palettes used for its preparation assumed a prominent role in the late Predynastic Egyptian culture. Kohl was originally used as protection against eye ailments. There was also a belief that darkening around the eyes would protect one from the harsh rays of the sun. Ancient Egyptian women wearing kohl, from a tomb mural in Thebes (1420–1375 BCE). Galena eye paint (later termed Kohl in Arabic from the Akkadian word for the cosmetic) was widely applied in Ancient Egypt. Upper eyelids were painted black and lower ones were colored green, as depicted in ancient texts that describe the use of both black galena and green malachite. Ancient graves from the pre-historic Tasian culture point to the early application of galena in Egypt, a custom stretching from as old as the Badarian period through to Greco-Roman era. Although found locally, both black galena and green malachite were also imported from nearby regions in Western Asia, Coptos and the Land of Punt.Studies in Ancient Technology, Volume III, (Brill Archive), p.18. The 18th Dynasty Ancient Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut would also grind charred frankincense into kohl eyeliner. This is the first recorded use of the resin. The frankincense itself had originally been obtained during an expedition to the ancient Land of Punt in this New Kingdom dynasty ( 1500 BC). Cosmetic ingredients such as cinnamon bark and other spice components – used for fragrances – alongside copper kohl sticks were exported from Tamraparni (ancient Sri Lanka) towns Pomparippu and Kadiramalai-Kandarodai to ancient Egypt. Additionally, the pioneering Muslim scholar Ibn Abi Shayba described in a legal compilation how to apply kohl to the eye, as narrated by earlier authorities. Berber and Semitic women in North Africa and the Middle East, respectively, also apply kohl to their faces. A vertical line is drawn from the bottom lip to the chin and along the bridge of the nose. Originally the line from the bottom lip to the chin shows whether a woman is married or not. This form of using Kohl on the face originates from the Arabian Peninsula, and was introduced in the 7th century in North-Africa.Many Mirrors: Body Image and Social Relations. Nicole Landry Sault. Eye paint was worn in ancient Israel as well; one of Job's daughters had the name Keren-Happuch (\\"horn ofeye paint\\") (Job42:14). Among the Israelites, the eye paint was frequently associated with women of ill repute of evil intent : \\"When Jehu came to Jezreel, , Jezebel heard of it ; she painted her eyes with kohl (\\"wattāśem bappûk\\"), and adorned her head, and looked out of the window\\" (2 Kings 9:30). For Jeremiah, Jerusalem can be personnified as a prostitute: \\"And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in crimson, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with kohl (\\"tiqrĕ'ĭ bappûk\\") ?\\" (Jer. 4:30). Similarly, Ezekiel portrays unfaithful Jerusalem as the prostitute Oholobah: \\"They even sent for men to come from far away, to whom a messenger was sent, and they came.

Kohl is used by both sexes, and by people of all ages, mainly during weddings, Islamic festivals (such as Eid ul Fitr and Eid ul Adha), and trips to the mosque for the weekly Jumuah congregational prayer. For women, kohl or black- henna is applied to the face as well in a similar manner as that practiced by communities in North Africa. South Asia A Varanasi food seller with his granddaughter wearing kohl. Kohl is known by various names in South Asian languages, like surma in Punjabi, Sylheti and Urdu, kajal in Hindi and Gujarati, kajol in Bengali, kajalh in Marathi, kanmashi in Malayalam, kaadige in Kannada, kaatuka in Telugu and kan mai in Tamil. In India, it is used by women as a type of eyeliner that is put around the edge of the eyes. In many parts of India, especially in Southern India, Karnataka in particular, women of the household prepare the kajal. This homemade kajal is used even for infants. Local tradition considers it to be a very good coolant for the eyes and believes that it protects the eyesight and vision from the sun. Tamil woman applying kohl on her son in India. Some Indian Ayurvedic or Ancient Indian Herbal medicines manufacturing companies add camphor and other medicinal herbs that are beneficial for eyes in their kajal. It can serve not only as a cosmetic but also as medicine for the eyes. In Punjabi culture, surma is a traditional ceremonial dye, which predominantly men of the Punjab wear around their eyes on special social or religious occasions. It is usually applied by the wife or the mother of the person. Some women also add a dot of kajal on the left side of the foreheads or on the waterline of the eye of women and children to ward off buri nazar, also known as buri nozor. Buri nazar literally means 'bad glance' and is comparable to the 'evil eye', although it can be interpreted as ill-wishes of people or even lustful eyes, in the sense of men ogling women. It signifies that the person is not perfect, with them having 'black mark', and hence, people wouldn't be jealous of their beauty. In the centuries-old Indian Bharatnatayam dances, the dancers apply heavy kohl to their eyes so as to draw attention to their eye gestures and movement. The kohl is then applied to eyebrows and eyelids to add further enhancement to the dancers. Kohl and Islam Pashtun man with kohl applied under eyes and beard dyed with henna following the Sunnah of Muhammad. In Islam, Muhammad used kohl and recommended others to use it because he believed that it was beneficial for the eyesIslamQA fatwa 44696: \\"Pure kohl is beneficial to the eyes and is not harmful\\" retrieved September 18, 2015 based on the following saying by him: \\"One of the best kinds of kohl that you use is Ithmid (antimony); it brightens the vision and makes the hair (eye-lashes) grow\\"“Sunan an-Nasa'i 5113: Vol. 6, Book 48, Hadith 5116” and he \\"used to apply kohl to his right eye three times, and to his left eye twice.\\" It is used by many Muslim men today during Ramadan as a sign of devotionMerdeka: \\"Tradisi unik muslim Yaman rias mata dengan kohl saat Ramadan\\"\\"Proverb of the day: Instead of applying kohl to her eyes, he blinded her\\" Ahram Online.

This dip and dry process is done all day long. After sunset, a wick is made out of the cloth, which is then used to light a mud lamp filled with castor oil. A brass vessel is kept over the lamp, leaving a little gap, just enough for the oxygen to aid the burning of the lamp. This is left burning overnight. In the morning, one or two drops of pure ghee (clarified cow's butter) or castor oil are added to the soot which now lines the brass vessel. It is then stored in a clean dry box. All the ingredients used in this preparation (sandalwood/Manjal karsilanganni, castor oil, ghee) are believed to have medicinal properties. They are still used in Indian therapies like ayurveda and Siddha medicines. In rural Bengal, kajol or surma is made from the \\"Monosha\\" plant, a type of succulent spurge (Euphorbia neriifolia). The leaf of Monosha is covered with oil and is kept above a burning diya (mud lamp). Within minutes the leaf is covered with creamy soft black soot which is so safe and sterile that it is even applied to infants. Health concerns The content of kohl and the recipes to prepare it vary greatly. In North Africa and Middle East, homemade kohl is often made by grinding galena (lead sulfide). Western manufacturers use amorphous carbon or organic charcoal instead of lead. Plant oils and the soot from various nuts, seeds, and gum resins are often added to the carbon powder. The non-lead products are considered to be of inferior quality to the older, traditional varieties and therefore there has been an increase in the use of handmade, lead-based kohl. Kurdish kohl (kil) set. For decades various conflicting reports in the literature have been published relating to kohl application to eyes being responsible for causing higher blood lead concentration, which may cause lead poisoning. While at the same time, a number of research studies and reports have also been published refuting any such links with increased blood lead level upon kohl (surma) application.Mahmood ZA, Zoha SM, Usmanghani K, Hasan MM, Ali O, Jahan S, Saeed A, Zaihd R, Zubair M., Pak. J. Pharm. Sci., Vol.22, No.1, January 2009, pp. 107–122. \\"KOHL (SURMA): RETROSPECT AND PROSPECT\\" A group of researchers in China tried to find some scientific basis of this claimed property of lead sulphide (galena) relating to absorption of sun rays when applied into the eyes in the form of kohl.Li-Yun C, Wen H, Jian-Feng H and Jian-Peng W (2008). \\"Influence of deposition voltage on properties of lead sulfide thin film.\\" American Ceramic Society Bulletin, 87(6): 9101–9104 The authors reported the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of a thin film of lead sulphide prepared on \\"Indium Tin Oxide\\" (ITO) substrate. The spectra showed that lead sulphide thin films had higher absorption and lower transmittance in UV light band which further increases with the increased deposition voltage. The drive to eliminate lead from kohl was sparked by studies in the early 1990s of preparations of kohl that found high levels of contaminants, including lead.al-Hazzaa SA, Krahn PM., Int Ophthalmol. 1995;19(2):83–8. \\"Kohl: a hazardous eyeliner.\\"Parry C, Eaton J., Environ Health Perspect. 1991 Aug;94:121–3. \\"Kohl: a lead-hazardous eye makeup from the Third World to the First World.\\" Lead levels in commercial kohl preparations were as high as 84%.

Complications of lead poisoning include anemia, growth retardation, low IQ, convulsions, and in severe cases, death. Anemia from lead poisoning is of special concern in Middle Eastern and South Asian countries where other forms of anemia are prevalent, including iron deficiency anemia (from malnutrition) and hemoglobinopathy (sickle cell anemia, thalassemia). These banned products are different from lead-free cosmetics that use the term \\"kohl\\" only to describe its shade/color, rather than its actual ingredients. Some modern eye cosmetics are marketed as \\"kohl\\", but are prepared differently and in accordance with relevant health standards. Eye cosmetics such as surma are recognized as one of the important sources of lead exposure in Pakistan. As adverse health effects of heavy metals are a public health concern, where especially lead may cause negative health impacts to human fetal and infantile development, a study in Pakistan of pregnant women' nails in 2016, showed thirteen nail samples out of 84 nails analyzed, contained lead higher than the concentration (13.6 μg/g) of the fatal lead poisoning case, with the possibility of an external contamination. The observations showed that lead-containing surma consists of fine particle of galena (ore of lead sulfide) in respirable dust range (less than 10 μm) and relative in vitro bioavailability of lead in the surma was determined as 5.2%. Thus, lead-containing surma consists of inhalable and bioavailable particles, and it contributes an increased risk of lead exposure. \\"Blue\\" Kohl is a dark- bluish black pigment composed of both lead-based compounds as well as a compound of antimony. The lead-based compounds in kohl are galena (PbS) – dark grey and gloss laurionite ( PbCl(OH)) – white phosgenite ((PbCl)2CO3); cerussite (PbCO3) – blue. The antimony-based compound in kohl is stibnite (Sb2S3) – blue. In January 2010, French researchers reported that the particular heavy eye makeup that ancient Egyptians wore may have had medical benefits. At submicromolar concentrations, the specially made lead compounds can elicit overproduction of nitrous oxide (N2O), which in turn can trigger an enhancement of the immune response.Tapsoba, et al. Journal of Analytic Chemistry 2010 http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac902348gNational Geographic \\"Cleopatra's eye makeup\\" The ancient Egyptians, documented in the Ebers Papyrus ( 1550 BCE), discuss these compounds within kohl as protective for the eyes. Indeed, kohl was used an eyeliner and cosmetic. There are a number of endemic ocular diseases in the Nile region including trachoma, a chlamydial organism which can cause corneal scarring and conjunctival cicatricial disease, with visual loss. Kohl was used not only as a cosmetic but also as a medicinal collyrium (from Gr. kollurion). Two of kohl's lead compounds — the lead chlorides laurionite and phosgenite — were not natural to the Nile valley. It is believed they were intentionally synthesized by the ancient Egyptians for this purpose. The widespread use of kohl across the Mediterranean and the Mid-east attests to its ability to protect the eye from infectious disease and be used as a cosmetic. =Legal status= Kohl is not on the list of color additives approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which considers kohl unsafe for use due to its potential lead content. It is thus illegal to import into, or sell in, the United States. In popular culture Theda Bara, with her eyes highlighted by kohl *At the beginning of the 1999 British film East is East, the character George Khan played by Om Puri applies kohl to his son's eyes before his wedding. *The film actress Theda Bara used kohl to rim her eyes throughout her career. *In the BBC Four program Lost Weekend which he curated, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards attributes his use of kohl to the Semi-nomadic tribes of North Africa, where he vacationed frequently in the late 1960s. *Marc Antony in the HBO series Rome is seen wearing Kohl along with many of the Egyptian characters. *Jack Sparrow, a character in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, wears kohl around his eyes. *Prince wore kohl around his eyes throughout his career. *Edward Gorey wrote: \\"The Wanton, though she knows its dangers / must needs smear Kohl about her eyes / and wake the interest of strangers / with long-drawn, hoarse, erotic sighs.\\" *In the song \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" by Passengers (a collaboration between U2 and Brian Eno), a line asks \\"Is there a time for kohl and lipstick? / a time for curling hair / is there a time for High Street shopping? / to find the right dress to wear\\". *Mariska Veres, lead singer for the Dutch rock group Shocking Blue, wore kohl around her eyes. *In the webcomic Gunnerkrigg Court, kohl is referenced by the name surma, which is the protagonist's mother's name, and the protagonist's name is antimony, an ingredient of kohl. *Charley, a character in the 2009 film A Single Man, used kohl to prepare herself for a dinner date. *Rabia, a character in the 2010 Pakistani drama Dastaan, used kohl to line Bano's eyes to enhance her beauty. *Raees (played by Shah Rukh Khan) a character in the 2017 Indian crime-action film Raees, wears kohl in the whole film as a part of his character.

Comparison of insulin crystals growth in outer space (left) and on Earth (right). In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) involves a comprehensive set of processes aimed at the production of manufactured goods in the space environment. ISM is also often used interchangeably with the term in-orbit manufacturing given that current production capabilities are limited to low Earth orbit. There are several rationales supporting in-space manufacturing: * The space environment, in particular the effects of microgravity and vacuum, enable the research of and production of goods that could otherwise not be manufactured on Earth. * The extraction and processing of raw materials from other astronomical bodies, also called In-Situ Resource Utilisation (ISRU) could enable more sustainable space exploration missions at reduced cost compared to launching all required resources from Earth. * Raw materials could be transported to low Earth orbit where they could be processed into goods that are shipped to Earth. By replacing terrestrial production on Earth, this is sought to preserve the Earth. * Raw materials of very high value, for example gold, silver of platinum, could be transported to low Earth orbit for processing or transfer to Earth which is thought to have the potential to become economically viable. History During the Soyuz 6 mission of 1969, Russian astronauts performed the first welding experiments in space. Three different welding processes were tested using a hardware unit called Vulkan. The tests included welding aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel. The Skylab mission, launched in May 1973, served as a laboratory to perform various space manufacturing experiments. The station was equipped with a materials processing facility that included a multi-purpose electric furnace, a crystal growth chamber, and an electron beam gun. Among the experiments to be performed was research on molten metal processing; photographing the behavior of ignited materials in zero-gravity; crystal growth; processing of immiscible alloys; brazing of stainless steel tubes, electron beam welding, and the formation of spheres from molten metal. The crew spent a total of 32 man-hours on materials science and space manufacturing investigation during the mission. The Space Studies Institute began hosting a bi-annual Space Manufacturing Conference in 1977. Microgravity research in materials processing continued in 1983 using the Spacelab facility. This module has been carried into orbit 26 times aboard the Space Shuttle, . In this role the shuttle served as an interim, short-duration research platform before the completion of the International Space Station. robotic arm. NASA image In February 1994 and September 1995, the Wake Shield Facility was carried into orbit by the Space Shuttle. This demonstration platform used the vacuum created in the orbital wake to manufacture thin films of gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. On May 31, 2005, the recoverable, unmanned Foton-M2 laboratory was launched into orbit. Among the experiments were crystal growth and the behavior of molten-metal in weightlessness. The completion of the International Space Station has provided expanded and improved facilities for performing industrial research. These have and will continue to lead to improvements in our knowledge of materials sciences, new manufacturing techniques on Earth, and potentially some important discoveries in space manufacturing methods. NASA and Tethers Unlimited will test the Refabricator aboard the ISS, which is intended to recycle plastic for use in space additive manufacturing. The Material Science Laboratory Electromagnetic Levitator (MSL-EML) on board the Columbus Laboratory is a science facility that can be used to study the melting and solidification properties of various materials. The Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) is used to study the behavior of liquids in microgravity. Material properties in the space environment There are several unique differences between the properties of materials in space compared to the same materials on the Earth. These differences can be exploited to produce unique or improved manufacturing techniques. * The microgravity environment allows control of convection in liquids or gasses, and the elimination of sedimentation. Diffusion becomes the primary means of material mixing, allowing otherwise immiscible materials to be intermixed. The environment allows enhanced growth of larger, higher-quality crystals in solution. * The ultraclean vacuum of space allows the creation of very pure materials and objects. The use of vapor deposition can be used to build up materials layer by layer, free from defects. * Surface tension causes liquids in microgravity to form perfectly round spheres. This can cause problems when trying to pump liquids through a conduit, but it is very useful when perfect spheres of consistent size are needed for an application. * Space can provide readily available extremes of heat and cold. Sunlight can be focused to concentrate enough heat to melt the materials, while objects kept in perpetual shade are exposed to temperatures close to absolute zero. The temperature gradient can be exploited to produce strong, glassy materials. Material processing For most manufacturing applications, specific material requirements must be satisfied. Mineral ores need to be refined to extract specific metals, and volatile organic compounds will need to be purified. Ideally these raw materials are delivered to the processing site in an economical manner, where time to arrival, propulsion energy expenditure, and extraction costs are factored into the planning process. Minerals can be obtained from asteroids, the lunar surface, or a planetary body. Volatiles could potentially be obtained from a comet, carbonaceous chondrite or \\"C-Type\\" asteroids, or the moons of Mars or other planets. It may also prove possible to extract hydrogen in the form of water ice or hydrated minerals from cold traps on the poles of the Moon. Unless the materials processing and the manufacturing sites are co-located with the resource extraction facilities, the raw materials would need to be moved about the solar system. There are several proposed means of providing propulsion for this material, including solar sails, electric sails, magnetic sails, electric ion thrusters, or mass drivers (this last method uses a sequence of electromagnets mounted in a line to accelerate a conducting material). At the materials processing facility, the incoming materials will need to be captured by some means. Maneuvering rockets attached to the load can park the content in a matching orbit. Alternatively, if the load is moving at a low delta-v relative to the destination, then it can be captured by means of a mass catcher. This could consist of a large, flexible net or inflatable structure that would transfer the momentum of the mass to the larger facility. Once in place, the materials can be moved into place by mechanical means or by means of small thrusters. Materials can be used for manufacturing either in their raw form, or by processing them to extract the constituent elements. Processing techniques include various chemical, thermal, electrolytic, and magnetic methods for separation. In the near term, relatively straightforward methods can be used to extract aluminum, iron, oxygen, and silicon from lunar and asteroidal sources. Less concentrated elements will likely require more advanced processing facilities, which may have to wait until a space manufacturing infrastructure is fully developed. Some of the chemical processes will require a source of hydrogen for the production of water and acid mixtures. Hydrogen gas can also be used to extract oxygen from the lunar regolith, although the process is not very efficient. So a readily available source of useful volatiles is a positive factor in the development of space manufacturing. Alternatively, oxygen can be liberated from the lunar regolith without reusing any imported materials by heating the regolith to in a vacuum. This was tested on Earth with lunar simulant in a vacuum chamber. As much as 20% of the sample was released as free oxygen. Eric Cardiff calls the remainder slag. This process is highly efficient in terms of imported materials used up per batch, but is not the most efficient process in energy per kilogram of oxygen. One proposed method of purifying asteroid materials is through the use of carbon monoxide (CO). Heating the material to and exposing it to CO causes the metals to form gaseous carbonyls. This vapor can then be distilled to separate out the metal components, and the CO can then be recovered by another heating cycle. Thus an automated ship can scrape up loose surface materials from, say, the relatively nearby 4660 Nereus (in delta-v terms), process the ore using solar heating and CO, and eventually return with a load of almost pure metal. The economics of this process can potentially allow the material to be extracted at one-twentieth the cost of launching from Earth, but it would require a two-year round trip to return any mined ore. Manufacturing Due to speed of light constraints on communication, manufacturing in space at a distant point of resource acquisition will either require completely autonomous robotics to perform the labor, or a human crew with all the accompanying habitat and safety requirements. If the plant is built in orbit around the Earth, or near a manned space habitat, however, telecheric devices can be used for certain tasks that require human intelligence and flexibility. Solar power provides a readily available power source for thermal processing. Even with heat alone, simple thermally-fused materials can be used for basic construction of stable structures. Bulk soil from the Moon or asteroids has a very low water content, and when melted to form glassy materials is very durable. These simple, glassy solids can be used for the assembly of habitats on the surface of the Moon or elsewhere. The solar energy can be concentrated in the manufacturing area using an array of steerable mirrors. The availability and favorable physical properties of metals will make them a major component of space manufacturing. Most of the metal handling techniques used on Earth can also be adopted for space manufacturing. A few of these techniques will need significant modifications due to the microgravity environment. The production of hardened steel in space will introduce some new factors. Carbon only appears in small proportions in lunar surface materials and will need to be delivered from elsewhere. Waste materials carried by humans from the Earth is one possible source, as are comets. The water normally used to quench steel will also be in short supply, and require strong agitation. Casting steel can be a difficult process in microgravity, requiring special heating and injection processes, or spin forming. Heating can be performed using sunlight combined with electrical heaters. The casting process would also need to be managed to avoid the formation of voids as the steel cools and shrinks. Various metal-working techniques can be used to shape the metal into the desired form. The standard methods are casting, drawing, forging, machining, rolling, and welding. Both rolling and drawing metals require heating and subsequent cooling. Forging and extrusion can require powered presses, as gravity is not available. Electron beam welding has already been demonstrated on board the Skylab, and will probably be the method of choice in space. Machining operations can require precision tools which will need to be imported from the Earth for some duration. New space manufacturing technologies are being studied at places such as Marshall's National Center for Advanced Manufacturing. The methods being investigated include coatings that can be sprayed on surfaces in space using a combination of heat and kinetic energy, and electron beam free form fabrication of parts. Approaches such as these, as well as examination of material properties that can be investigated in an orbiting laboratory, will be studied on the International Space Station by NASA and Made In Space, Inc.Basulto, Dominic.

With 3D printing technologies, rather than exporting tools and equipment from Earth into space, astronauts have the option to manufacture needed items directly. On-demand patterns of manufacturing make long-distance space travel more feasible and self- sufficient as space excursions require less cargo. Mission safety is also improved.

Made In Space lists the advantages of 3D printing as easy customization, minimal raw material waste, optimized parts, faster production time, integrated electronics, limited human interaction, and option to modify the printing process. The Refabricator experiment, under development by Firmamentum, a division of Tethers Unlimited, Inc. under a NASA Phase III Small Business Innovation Research contract, combines a recycling system and a 3D printer to perform demonstration of closed-cycle in-space manufacturing on the International Space Station (ISS). The Refabricator experiment, scheduled for launch to the ISS in early 2018, will process plastic feedstock through multiple printing and recycling cycles to evaluate how many times the plastic materials can be re-used in the microgravity environment before their polymers degrade to unacceptable levels. Additionally, 3D printing in space can also account for the printing of meals. NASA's Advanced Food Technology program is currently investigating the possibility of printing food items in order to improve food quality, nutrient content, and variety. Products There are thought to be a number of useful products that can potentially be manufactured in space and result in an economic benefit. Research and development is required to determine the best commodities to be produced, and to find efficient production methods. The following products are considered prospective early candidates: * Growth of protein crystals * Improved semiconductor wafers *Micro-encapsulation As the infrastructure is developed and the cost of assembly drops, some of the manufacturing capacity can be directed toward the development of expanded facilities in space, including larger scale manufacturing plants. These will likely require the use of lunar and asteroid materials, and so follow the development of mining bases. Rock is the simplest product, and at minimum is useful for radiation shielding. It can also be subsequently processed to extract elements for various uses. Water from lunar sources, Near Earth Asteroids or Martian moons is thought to be relatively cheap and simple to extract, and gives adequate performance for many manufacturing and material shipping purposes. Separation of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be easily performed in small scale, but some scientistshttp://www.neofuel.com/ believe that this will not be performed on any large scale initially due to the large quantity of equipment and electrical energy needed to split water and liquify the resultant gases. Water used in steam rockets gives a specific impulse of about 190 seconds; less than half that of hydrogen/oxygen, but this is adequate for delta-v's that are found between Mars and Earth. Water is useful as a radiation shield and in many chemical processes. Ceramics made from lunar or asteroid soil can be employed for a variety of manufacturing purposes. These uses include various thermal and electrical insulators, such as heat shields for payloads being delivered to the Earth's surface. Metals can be used to assemble a variety of useful products, including sealed containers (such as tanks and pipes), mirrors for focusing sunlight, and thermal radiators. The use of metals for electrical devices would require insulators for the wires, so a flexible insulating material such as plastic or fiberglass will be needed. A notable output of space manufacturing is expected to be solar panels. Expansive solar energy arrays can be constructed and assembled in space. As the structure does not need to support the loads that would be experienced on Earth, huge arrays can be assembled out of proportionately smaller amounts of material. The generated energy can then be used to power manufacturing facilities, habitats, spacecraft, lunar bases, and even beamed down to collectors on the Earth with microwaves. Other possibilities for space manufacturing include propellants for spacecraft, some repair parts for spacecraft and space habitats, and, of course, larger factories. Ultimately, space manufacturing facilities can hypothetically become nearly self-sustaining, requiring only minimal imports from the Earth. The microgravity environment allows for new possibilities in construction on a massive scale, including megascale engineering. These future projects might potentially assemble space elevators, massive solar array farms, very high capacity spacecraft, and rotating habitats capable of sustaining populations of tens of thousands of people in Earth-like conditions.  Challenges  The space environment is expected to be beneficial for production of a variety of products assuming the obstacles to it can be overcome. The most significant cost is overcoming the energy hurdle for boosting materials into orbit. Once this barrier is significantly reduced in cost per kilogram, the entry price for space manufacturing can make it much more attractive to entrepreneurs. After the heavy capitalization costs of assembling the mining and manufacturing facilities are paid, the production will need to be economically profitable in order to become self-sustaining and beneficial to society. The economic requirements of space manufacturing imply a need to collect the requisite raw materials at a minimum energy cost. The cost of space transport is directly related to the delta-v, or change in velocity required to move from the mining sites to the manufacturing plants. Bringing material to Earth orbit from bodies such as Near-Earth asteroids, Phobos, Deimos or the lunar surface requires far less delta-v than launching from Earth itself, despite the greater distances involved. This makes these places economically attractive as sources of raw materials.

In modern times, the term can also be written 九十九神 (literally ninety-nine kami), to emphasize the agedness.村上健司 『妖怪辞典』 毎日新聞社 2000年 221頁 。小松和彦監修 『日本怪異妖怪大辞典』 東京堂出版 2013年 371頁 。 According to Komatsu Kazuhiko, the idea of a tsukumogami or a yōkai of tools spread mostly in the Japanese Middle Ages and declined in more recent generations. Komatsu infers that despite the depictions in Bakumatsu period ukiyo-e art leading to a resurfacing of the idea, these were all produced in an era cut off from any actual belief in the idea of tsukumogami. Because the term has been applied to several different concepts in Japanese folklore, there remains some confusion as to what the term actually means. Today, the term is generally understood to be applied to virtually any object \\"that has reached its 100th birthday and thus become alive and self-aware\\", though this definition is not without controversy. History and etymology Woodblock print, A New Collection of Monsters 新板化物つくし, 1860 Hokusai, The Lantern Ghost, 1826/1837 The kanji representation of 付喪神 for \\"tsukumogami\\" comes from a Tenpō period otogizōshi, an emakimono called the Tsukumogami Emaki. According to this emaki, a tool, after the passage of 100 years, would obtain a spirit (kami or -gami as a suffix), with this change resulting in a tsukumogami. This emaki also had a caption mentioning that \\"tsukumo\\" could also be written as 九十九 (meaning \\"ninety-nine\\", or more literally, \\"nine tens [九十] and nine [九]\\") referring to \\"one year less than a full hundred\\". This led to the interpretation that this meaning came from \\"tsukumo hair\\" or つくも髪, which is also pronounced tsukumogami since the hair kanji (髪) is a homophone of the spirit kami/-gami. This version of the word appeared in a waka poem in The Tales of Ise, section 63, referring to an old woman's white hair, which is why tsukumo means \\"a long time (ninety-nine years)\\". Outside of these uses, the word \\"tsukumogami\\" does not appear anywhere in extant literature of the time, and so historical usage of the term itself has not been handed down in detail. The concept, however, does appear elsewhere. In collections such as the Konjaku Monogatarishū, there are tales that could be seen to be about objects having a spirit, and in the emakimono Bakemono Zōshi, there are tales of a chōshi (a sake serving-pot), a scarecrow, and other objects turning into monsters, but the word \\"tsukumogami\\" itself does not appear. The Tsukumogami Emaki describes how an object would become occupied by a spirit after one hundred years, By doing this, they prevented objects from becoming tsukumogami, but according to the captions of this emaki, it's written that ones that are \\"a year from one hundred,\\" in other words, objects that are \\"tsukumo\\" (ninety-nine) years old would become angered and become a yōkai by some means other than the mere passage of time, and then cause a ruckus. In the first place, the idea of becoming a yōkai at one-hundred or ninety-nine years old does not need to be taken literally. Those numbers can represent the idea that humans, plants, animals, or even tools would acquire a spiritual nature once they become significantly old, and thereby gain the power to change themselves. Writing tsukumo as 九十九 (\\"ninety-nine\\") is not simply referring to a number, since the word was used since old times to loosely mean \\"many\\".『熊野古道をあるく』 Jtbパブリッシング 2015年 34頁 The yōkai that are depicted are not ones that gained the power to change themselves as a result of being used for a long time, but rather ones that were thrown away right before it, becoming a yōkai through some different means. Paintings In the Tsukumogami Emaki, which depicted tsukumogami, it is written at the very beginning, \\"It's told in the Onmyō Zakki. A tool, after one hundred years pass, would change and acquire a spirit, and deceive people's hearts, and it's said these are referred to as tsukumogami,\\" thus referring to changes or mutations of tools as \\"tsukumogami\\" (however, no book called the Onmyō Zakki has actually been confirmed to exist). In the emaki, it's written that they can take on \\"the appearance of people male and female, old and young\\" (appearance of humans), \\"the likeness of chimi akki\\" (appearance of oni), and \\"the shape of korō yakan\\" (the appearance of animals), among others. Its form after its change/mutation is referred to with words such as \\"youbutsu\\" (). Even in emakimono that came before the Tsukumogami Emaki, paintings of yōkai based on tools can be confirmed, and in the Tsuchigumo Zōshi, there were depictions of gotoku (trivets) with heads, stamp mills with the body of a snake and two human arms attached to it, and a tsunodarai (four-handled basin) with a face and growing teeth, among others. Also, a face that appears to be what the tsunodarai is based on appears in the Yūzū Nenbutsu Engi Emaki (融通念仏縁起絵巻) and the Fudō Rieki Engi Emaki () where a yakugami with almost the same appearance appears. However, all of these were not merely tools, but ones that are a hybrid with a tool or oni. This characteristic can also be seen in the Tsukumogami Emaki and the Hyakki Yagyō Emaki. The Hyakki Yagyō Emaki from the Muromachi period, author unknown. They are yōkai of tools, so they are commonly thought of as tsukumogami. The Hyakki Yagyō Emaki (百鬼夜行絵巻) from the Muromachi period also depicts many of what appear to be yōkai of tools. In the present day, these tools yōkai are thought to be depictions of tsukumogami, and it has been inferred that the parade depicted in the Hyakki Yagyō Emaki is likely the \\"youbutsu\\" (aged objects) of the Tsukumogami Emaki in a festival parade. Works about tools In works about tools having a human personality, tools such as the \\"chōdo uta-awase\\" that would perform uta-awase can be found before the Muromachi period, and it is thought that these are close in concept to being the idea of \\"things that tools turn into\\" as depicted in the Tsukumogami Emaki. Understood by many Western scholars, tsukumogami was a concept popular in Japanese folklore as far back as the tenth century, used in the spread of Shingon Buddhism. In Japanese folklore According to Elison and Smith (1987), Tsukumogami was the name of an animated tea caddy that Matsunaga Hisahide used to bargain for peace with Oda Nobunaga. Like many concepts in Japanese folklore, there are several layers of definition used when discussing Tsukumogami. For example, by the tenth century, the Tsukumogami myths were used in helping to spread the \\"doctrines of Shingon Esoteric Buddhism to a variety of audiences, ranging from the educated to the relatively unsophisticated, by capitalizing upon pre-existing spiritual beliefs in Tsukumogami.\\" These \\"pre-existing spiritual beliefs\\" were, as Reider explains: > Tsukumogami are animate household objects. An otogizōshi (\\"companion tale\\") > titled Tsukumogami ki (\\"Record of tool kami\\"; Muromachi period) explains > that after a service life of nearly one hundred years, utsuwamono or kibutsu > (containers, tools, and instruments) receive souls. While many references > are made to this work as a major source for the definition of tsukumogami, > insufficient attention has been paid to the actual text of Tsukumogami ki. By the twentieth century the Tsukumogami had entered into Japanese popular culture to such an extent that the Buddhist teachings had been \\"completely lost to most outsiders,\\" leaving critics to comment that, by and large, the Tsukumogami were harmless and at most tended to play occasional pranks, they did have the capacity for anger and would band together to take revenge upon those who were wasteful or threw them away thoughtlessly – compare mottainai. To prevent this, to this day some jinja ceremonies are performed to console broken and unusable items. List of tsukumogami * Abumi-guchi – A furry creature formed from the stirrup of a mounted military commander that works for Yama Orochi * Bakezōri – A possessed zōri (traditional straw sandals) * Biwa-bokuboku – An animated Biwa * Boroboroton – A possessed Futon * Chōchinobake – An animated lantern, also known as Burabura * Ichiren-bozu – Animated prayer beads * Ittan-momen – A roll of cotton * Jatai – Possessed cloths draped from folding screens * Kameosa – A possessed sake jar * Kasa- obake – An animated paper umbrella. Also known as Karakasa-obake.Although modern sources might guess that the kasa obake is a tsukumogami, the initial sources that introduced it made no such reference (see page for kasa-obake). Therefore, its true nature is unknown. * Kosode-no-te – A possessed kimono robe * Koto-furunushi – An animated Koto * Kurayarō – Animated saddle * Kyōrinrin – Possessed scrolls or papers * Menreiki – A spiritual creature formed out of 66 masks * Minowaraji- An animated Mino straw coat * Morinji-no- okama – A possessed tea kettle.

It is split into two parts, the elected and the appointed. The supreme governing institution of the Baháʼí Faith is the Universal House of Justice, situated in Haifa, Israel. Some features set apart the Baháʼí administration from similar systems of human government: elected representatives should follow their conscience, rather than being responsible to the views of electors; political campaigning, nominations and parties are prohibited; and religious authority was passed down from its founder to the Universal House of Justice. The Baháʼí administration has four charter documents, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Tablets of the Divine Plan, the Tablet of Carmel and the Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. Character of Baháʼí administration Shoghi Effendi wrote that the Baháʼí Administrative Order incorporates within its structure certain elements which are to be found in each of the three recognized forms of secular government: autocracy, aristocracy and democracy. His objective in effectively designing the Baháʼí Administrative Order was to embody, reconcile and assimilate within it \\"such wholesome elements as are to be found in each one of them...\\" while excluding the \\"admitted evils inherent in each of these systems...\\" such that it \\"cannot ever degenerate into any form of despotism, of oligarchy, or of demagogy which must sooner or later corrupt the machinery of all man-made and essentially defective political institutions.\\" Baháʼu'lláh commended the British system of government that enhanced kingship through consultation with the people, but did not specifically endorse parliamentary democracy. These statements praise the principles of kingship and consultation with the people as principles for civil government. The Baháʼí Administrative Order concerns the system of administration within the Baháʼí Faith rather than civil government. This difference is highlighted in a letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi concerning the future world government foretold by Baháʼu'lláh and outlined by Shoghi Effendi, stating \\"As regards the International Executive referred to by the Guardian in his \\"Goal of a New World Order\\", this statement refers by no means to the Baháʼí Commonwealth of the future, but simply to that world government which will herald the advent and lead to the final establishment of the World Order of Baháʼu'lláh. The formation of this International Executive, which corresponds to the executive head or board in present-day national governments, is but a step leading to the Baháʼí world government of the future, and hence should not be identified with either the institution of the Guardianship or that of the International House of Justice.\\" In keeping with the Baháʼí principle of obedience to government, Baháʼí Administration is seen as subordinate to civil government. =Bahá'í consultation= A key point of the process of administration is the practice of consultation. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá states \\"The prime requisites for them that take counsel together are purity of motive, radiance of spirit, detachment from all else save God, attraction to His Divine Fragrances, humility and lowliness amongst His loved ones, patience and long-suffering in difficulties and servitude... The members thereof must take counsel together in such wise that no occasion for ill-feeling or discord may arise. This can be attained when every member expresseth with absolute freedom his own opinion and setteth forth his argument. Should any one oppose, he must on no account feel hurt for not until matters are fully discussed can the right way be revealed. The shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions. If after discussion, a decision be carried unanimously, well and good; but if the Lord forbid, differences of opinion should arise, a majority of voices must prevail.\\"Momen, Moojan (2005). Changing Reality: The Bahá'í Community and the Creation of a New Reality. Structure A diagram of the present Baháʼí administrative order The Baháʼí administration has two distinct elements: the elected and appointed. The highest elected body is the Universal House of Justice, which possesses the authority to supplement and apply the laws of Baháʼu'lláh. The highest appointed authority is the Institution of the Guardianship, which is a hereditary authority and has the exclusive \\"right of the interpretation of the Holy Writ solely conferred upon him.\\" (God Passes By) These two institutions are described in ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's Will and Testament as having divine authority: :\\"...The Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty... Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God\\" The same Will appoints Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian, and gives further details about the structure of the administration, including election and appointment processes. Shoghi Effendi worked throughout his life to establish the necessary secondary institutions that were required for the election of the Universal House of Justice, which was first elected in 1963. Having no ordained, professional priesthood, Baháʼís operate through a type of non-partisan democratic self- government. The traditional functions of community leadership and moral leadership are not vested in individuals, but in an institutional framework with two main branches. Elected institutions Sometimes referred to by Baháʼu'lláh as \\"the Rulers\\", Baháʼís elect members to councils which are vested with the authority of the community. The members of these councils, themselves, have no individual authority. When duly constituted, however, and specifically when deciding matters as a body, these councils act as the heads of the community. Baháʼu'lláh envisioned a Supreme House of Justice, with local Houses of Justice in every community where nine or more adult Baháʼís reside. ʻAbdu'l-Bahá unveiled the \\"Secondary\\", or National House of Justice in his will. Seen as embryonic institutions, national and local Houses of Justice are currently given the temporary appellation of \\"Spiritual Assemblies\\" and are expected, over time, to mature into fully functional Houses of Justice. The Universal House of Justice is seen as morally infallible, though this belief has subtleties, in that the Universal House of Justice can both make new Baháʼí law and repeal its own laws. It may not alter the scriptural laws defined by Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. National and Local Spiritual Assemblies are seen as requiring deference and obedience, but can be overruled by a superior elected institution. All decisions by these bodies must be made, and are considered valid if, and only if the body is duly constituted, and meeting as a body with a quorum of members present. These decisions are made through a specific process of consultation. =Universal House of Justice= The Universal House of Justice is the supreme governing body of the Baháʼí Faith. The Baháʼí writings affirm that its decisions are \\"the source of all good and freed from all error\\". It is elected every five years, and currently sitting members of all National Spiritual Assemblies act as delegates to its election. =National Spiritual Assemblies= A National Spiritual Assembly (NSA) normally represents a country, although sometimes regions are assigned their own NSA (e.g. Alaska). Sometimes several countries are grouped together into a single Assembly, for instance the Baltic States, or (originally) Canada and the United States. These boundaries are subject to the discretion of the Universal House of Justice, and can obviously change, Canada and the USA now having their own individual National Assemblies. These assemblies are elected annually through locally elected delegates. =Regional Baháʼí Councils= Regional Baháʼí Councils (RBC) have also been established in several larger national Baháʼí communities. They act under the direction of a National Spiritual Assembly and are elected by members of the local Spiritual Assemblies in their jurisdiction. They are increasingly taking on community growth and development activities, and provide guidance and structure for local communities' coordination on these. =Local Spiritual Assemblies= A Local Spiritual Assembly (LSA) represents a town, city, or county, and are elected annually by direct election. If a locality only has nine Baháʼís, then no election process is necessary. The Local Assemblies govern Baháʼí community life at the local level, and administer the affairs of the entire community, including coordinating the Nineteen Day Feast, holy day observances, funeral services, marriage counselling and many other tasks, though these are generally done through committee appointment. Appointed institutions Baháʼu'lláh makes reference to \\"the learned\\" among his people. The functions of this branch were originally carried out by the Hands of the Cause of God appointed by Baháʼu'lláh, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and Shoghi Effendi. When it was determined that no more \\"Hands\\" could be appointed, the Universal House of Justice formed the Institution of the Counsellors to fulfill their duties. The appointed members act as individuals. While they have no authority to command or rule on matters, they are \\"the learned\\" and individuals and institutions are morally obliged to consider their opinions. These individuals inspire, encourage, enjoin, and make the community aware of relevant scripture and guidance from the central institutions. Their function is loosely defined, though their duties are divided into the two general categories of protection and propagation of the Baháʼí Faith. The learned have a similar geographic hierarchy. =International Counsellors= The International Counsellors are nine individuals appointed to the International Teaching Centre, which is a body that directly assists the Universal House of Justice at the Baháʼí World Centre. They advise Baháʼís at the international level and coordinate the efforts of the Continental Counsellors. =Continental Counsellors= Individual Counsellors are assigned to continental boards, where they interact directly with several National Spiritual Assemblies. They often act in an informational capacity, communicating the direction and discussions at the World Centre to national communities. They will often focus their work on one or a set of countries within their jurisdiction. =Auxiliary Boards= Auxiliary Boards are appointed by the Continental Counsellors to assist them on a smaller geographic scale. They work with any Local Spiritual Assemblies, Regional Councils, and individuals within their jurisdiction. There are typically two boards in a single geographical region, one responsible for protection, and one for propagation of the community, though these functions often overlap. Both boards report to the Continental Board that appointed them, regardless of their focus. =Assistants= Auxiliary board members appoint \\"assistants\\" that operate on their behalf at the grassroots level. These assistants often meet with Local Spiritual Assemblies, speak at events, and are sought for advice by individual community members. They will sometimes have a very localized mandate, such as to focus on youth in a particular city, or they can be appointed broadly. Their role is as flexible as their Auxiliary board member feels is appropriate. =Recent developments= While most of the above have been in place for decades or more, in recent years with the institution of the Baháʼí institute process a number of other possible positions have been named: Regional Institute Boards, Area Teaching Committees, Cluster Growth Facilitators, Cluster Institute Coordinators, Cluster Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Programme Coordinators, and Cluster Children's Class Coordinator being examples. Elections Vietnamese Baha'is elect their National Spiritual Assembly in Danang, in 2009. Baháʼís consider their electoral process to be a sacred act, essential to the health of the community. Great effort is spent on organizing elections to meet with the exacting standards set by Shoghi Effendi. =Method= Baháʼí elections use what is described as a three-stage councilor-republican system to determine electors. Who the electors are and who the eligible members are depends on the scope of the election. At all levels, only residents within the jurisdiction of the body being elected are eligible for membership. In general, adult Baháʼís in good standing resident in the jurisdiction are both the electorate (either directly or through delegation) as well as the pool of potential members to serve on the body being elected. Voting itself is held using a system similar to the multiple member first past the post voting system. In the typical case, there are nine members on an Assembly or House of Justice, and therefore voters vote for nine individuals. Electors write the individual names of exactly nine eligible Baháʼís, without repeating. The nine Baháʼís with the most votes are elected. In cases of tie votes for the ninth-least- populous vote (for example), a run-off election is held (unless one of the tied candidates is a member of a minority in the community and is deemed elected). Baháʼí elections do not include any sort of constituency for members – all members are considered to be at-large. Members are chosen by the electorate based on Shoghi Effendi's stated criteria consisting of five qualities: :\\"Let us recall His explicit and often-repeated assurance that every Assembly elected in that rarefied atmosphere of selflessness and detachment is in truth, appointed of God, that its verdict is truly inspired, that one and all should submit to its decision unreservedly and with cheerfulness ... the elector ... is called upon to vote for none but those whom prayer and reflection have inspired him to uphold... Hence it is incumbent upon the chosen delegates to consider without the least trace of passion and prejudice, and irrespective of any material consideration, the names of only those who can best combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience... Nothing short of the all- encompassing, all-pervading power of His Guidance and Love can enable this newly enfolded order to gather strength and flourish amid the storm and stress of a turbulent age, and in the fullness of time vindicate its high claim to be universally recognized as the one Haven of abiding felicity and peace.\\"Shoghi Effendi, Directives from the Guardian, p. 23 [Emphasis added] The Universal House of Justice further clarified that the elector, having determined those who meet these qualifications, should give \\"due consideration. . . to such other factors as age distribution, diversity, and gender.\\"Universal House of Justice, Letter to the Baháʼís of the World, 25 March 2007, paragraph 7. =Non-partisanship= Shoghi Effendi sternly deprecated partisan politics and certain other practices current in western democracies, such as campaigning and nomination. As a result: *Nominations and campaigning are prohibited. Baháʼís should not seek to promote themselves as candidates. *Voters are urged not to consult with each other about the suitability of individuals. *Voters are strongly encouraged to study and discuss, in abstract, the qualities named by Shoghi Effendi as being necessary in those elected to serve, without reference to individuals. *Individuals should be selected only on the basis of their qualities, without reference to material means or other characteristics, except insofar as they provide insight into their qualities. *Those elected are expected to serve, though, in cases of extreme personal difficulty, such a member may request that the body to which they are elected excuse him or her. *In the event of a tying vote for the last places, if one of these individuals is a member of a minority, this individual is automatically awarded the position. (In the US, this refers to racial minority.) If this is unclear, or if there is disagreement as to whether the minority rule applies, a run-off election is held in which votes are cast only for one of those tied. Shoghi Effendi saw these (and other) aspects as essential to preserving the full rights and prerogatives of the electors, guarding them against manipulation. =Electoral scope= Local or regional At the local (city, town, county) level of administration, the nine-member Local Spiritual Assembly is elected by adult Baháʼís in that particular locality once a year during their Annual General Meeting on the First Day of the Ridvan Festival (the 13th day of the month of Glory, about 20 or 21 April). In the United States, Canada, and India, Regional Councils are elected by members of these Local Spiritual Assemblies in an election often conducted by mail. Again, no nominations occur, and each Local Spiritual Assembly member is directed to vote for those individuals who are resident in the region they feel are best suited to serve. National The selection of the National Spiritual Assembly is indirect using an electoral-unit delegation method. The nation is divided into voting districts or units. In each district the members are charged with selecting one or more delegates who will attend the annual national convention and vote for the members of the National Spiritual Assembly. The members at the local level are free to vote for any adult Bahaʼi(s) in the district or unit in good standing, keeping in mind the guidance from Shoghi Effendi that the individuals should, \\"combine the necessary qualities of unquestioned loyalty, of selfless devotion, of a well-trained mind, of recognized ability and mature experience...\\" The delegates elected at the local level have two principal duties to carry out at the national convention – to elect the National Spiritual Assembly and to make recommendations to that body on issues relevant to it. In a process parallel to the one at the local level, the delegates to the national convention are free to vote for the nine individuals who they feel will best carry out the duties of the National Spiritual Assembly. They are also free to voice any relevant concerns they have to the delegation and to the outgoing and incoming Assemblies. While the delegates can certainly convey to the convention the concerns of those in their district, they are in no way obligated to represent those who elected them. In addition, no input is provided to the delegates, either at the local or national levels, on whom to vote for in the national election. Global Every five years from 1963, members of all National Spiritual Assemblies are called to vote at an International Convention at the Baháʼí World Centre in Haifa, Israel for members of the Universal House of Justice. These members act as delegates in a manner similar to National Baháʼí elections. Those who are unable to attend send postal ballots. =Service on multiple institutions= Baháʼís may, depending on circumstances, serve on multiple institutions. Members of National Spiritual Assemblies have served on Local Spiritual Assemblies, and assistants within the appointed institutions may serve on Local Spiritual Assemblies. However, beyond this there are several practical limitations. National Spiritual Assemblies may ask Local Spiritual Assemblies to excuse those who are members of both bodies from executive positions, to free their time to do the work of that National Spiritual Assemblies. Members of the Auxiliary Boards appointed by the Counsellors who are elected to such an institution are asked to choose to serve either in their elected or appointed capacity, but not both. Members of the Universal House of Justice do not simultaneously serve on other elected bodies, though this may not be a formal policy. History =During Baháʼu'lláh's lifetime= The earliest depiction of the administration currently at work within the worldwide Baháʼí community can be found in the writings of Baháʼu'lláh. Founded upon the belief that God guides humanity through messengers, many of whom have prophesied a \\"Kingdom of Heaven on earth\\", and the belief that Baháʼu'lláh's revelation is the fulfillment of such prophesies, Baháʼís see in his writings a system both of God and of the people. Though Baháʼu'lláh intimated, earlier, many of the policies that would form the basis of the Baháʼí administrative system, his Kitáb-i-Aqdas provides the most solid initial glimpse of this system: :\\"The Lord hath ordained that in every city a House of Justice be established wherein shall gather counsellors to the number of Bahá, and should it exceed this number it doth not matter. They should consider themselves as entering the Court of the presence of God, the Exalted, the Most High, and as beholding Him Who is the Unseen. It behoveth them to be the trusted ones of the Merciful among men and to regard themselves as the guardians appointed of God for all that dwell on earth. It is incumbent upon them to take counsel together and to have regard for the interests of the servants of God, for His sake, even as they regard their own interests, and to choose that which is meet and seemly. Thus hath the Lord your God commanded you. Beware lest ye put away that which is clearly revealed in His Tablet. Fear God, O ye that perceive.\\" This House of Justice is described as being in concert with Baha'u'llah and the Aghsán, his descendants, but with the responsibility for creating and abrogating laws not explicitly revealed in the sacred scripture. Over time, these concepts were clarified initially in Baháʼu'lláh's writings, and then in those of his eldest son and successor, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá. =ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's ministry= It was ʻAbdu'l-Bahá who clarified the differing roles of Supreme/Universal (global) vs. the local Houses of Justice. During ʻAbdu'l-Bahá's life, he oversaw and encouraged the establishment of many elected local councils, calling them \\"Spiritual Assemblies\\". He wrote many clarifying letters, giving instructions to various Spiritual Assemblies, inspiring the Baháʼí world. The Tablets of the Divine Plan stand out, however, and formed a great part of the early goal setting and planning processes of the nascent spiritual community. This plan opened up whole new geographic regions to the Baháʼís, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá encouraging Baháʼís to connect with the peoples of all races and cultures. One of his greatest legacies to the development of the Baháʼí administrative system, however, was his will and testament, wherein he describes several new institutions. Clarifying Baháʼu'lláh's comments about his descendants and authority, he described the Institution of the Guardianship, which he saw as functioning in concert with the Universal House of Justice – one bearing responsibility for interpretation of scripture, the other as legislator of new law not covered by existing scripture. To these he commanded the obedience of the Baháʼís. :\\"The sacred and youthful branch, the Guardian of the Cause of God, as well as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and established, are both under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of the Exalted One (may my life be offered up for them both). Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God\\" In this document, ʻAbdu'l-Bahá also: * appointed his grandson Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian of the Cause of God * established criteria for the appointment of future Guardians. * defined a new scope of elected institution he called the \\"Secondary House of Justice\\", the first of which were elected under the administration of Shoghi Effendi. * enjoined the believers to shun Covenant-breakers – Baháʼís who opposed the head of the faith and attempted to create a split or faction. * defined some of the conditions for the future development of the Baháʼí administration. * clarified the institution of the Hands of the Cause, and clarified the requirements for their appointment. =Shoghi Effendi's administration= Under Shoghi Effendi, the Baháʼí Faith underwent its most dramatic shift in shape and process. While evolving from the skeletal structure established by Baháʼu'lláh and ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, Shoghi Effendi instituted large-scale campaigns of administrative consolidation, established practices and procedures for Baháʼí administrative bodies, appointed more Hands of the Cause, secured the legal position of the Baháʼí Community both in Haifa, but also, working with newly formed National Spiritual Assemblies, with many national governments. Over this period, Baháʼí institutions and inter-institutional collaboration became clearer, many finer points of Baháʼí law were explained, and the faith was spread to most of the globe. Baháʼí marriages became recognized in their own right in several regions and the Baháʼí Faith was recognized as an independent religion by many nations and religious courts, including Islamic religious courts in Egypt. Shoghi Effendi described the death of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and the start of his own administration as the end of the \\"Heroic age\\" and the start of the \\"Formative\\" age of the Baháʼí Faith. =After Shoghi Effendi= Shoghi Effendi died in 1957 with no children, and no will could be found. The 27 living Hands of the Cause, appointed for life by Shoghi Effendi and referred to by him as \\"the Chief Stewards of Baháʼu'lláh's embryonic World Commonwealth\\" signed a unanimous proclamation on 25 November 1957, shortly after the death of Shoghi Effendi, stating that he had died \\"without having appointed his successor\\", and leaving further decisions about the Guardianship to the Universal House of Justice which had yet to be elected. When, shortly after its ultimate election in 1963, this body examined the question of the succession of the Guardian it determined that there was no way to satisfy the provisions of the will and testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and that, therefore, no successor to the Shoghi Effendi could be named. Creating a constitution for itself that incorporated obedience to the body of Shoghi Effendi's writings, and to those of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá and Baháʼu'lláh, the Universal House of Justice assumed full authority over the affairs of the Baháʼí community. In 1968, the Universal House of Justice, in collaboration with the Hands of the Cause of God determined that only a Guardian of the Cause could appoint the Hands of the Cause, and decided to create the Continental Boards of Counsellors, to continue and assist in the work of the Hands. In 1973 the International Teaching Centre was established and the Hands were instructed to act as liaisons between the Counsellors appointed to it and the House of Justice. That same year the Auxiliary Board members were authorized to name \\"assistants\\" to act on local levels. All Hands have since died. =Modern evolution= One hundred years after Baháʼu'lláh's death, the Baháʼís celebrated a \\"holy year\\", during which the fully authorized translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas (Most Holy Book) was published. Coinciding with this was a process of re-examination of intra-Baháʼí administrative and community action, the implementation of Baháʼí law in greater degrees among non-Iranian Baháʼís, and the maturation of the Spiritual Assemblies. Through a series of plans, the Universal House of Justice refocused the Baháʼí community on community development, and systematization of best-practices, hoping to reduce the \\"boom and bust\\" cycles of community growth encountered in the previous century. The Baháʼí community began to incorporate more active service, socio-economic development efforts ballooned in number, and local and national communities became more focused on examining the needs of their wider non-Baháʼí communities, to see how the faith could aid them. The earliest days of the 21st century saw the Baháʼís begin to pare down their administrative structures, appoint fewer committees, and focus on very specific goals outlined by the Universal House of Justice – namely the creation of small grass-roots study groups, the creation of more neighbourhood-centric children's classes, and the increase in the spiritual character of the community through small devotional gatherings. The Baháʼís were encouraged not to see these \\"core activities\\" as simply Baháʼí activities. Rather, these were to be seen as activities which were open to the wider community, but would be characteristic of a Baháʼí's community life. This period also saw the establishment of regional councils, who form a level of administrative action more specific than a National Spiritual Assembly, but broader than the civic locality, a boundary which almost always defines the jurisdictions of Local Spiritual Assembly. These seem to be evolving and assuming many growth and consolidation and educational functions of Local Spiritual Assemblies, allowing these local bodies to meet the more personal needs of their community members. The present-day Baháʼí local, national and international communities experiment with community development methods, and seem to be attempting to harness the administrative structure to canalize grass-roots initiatives, rather than have higher institutions dictate highly specific plans and practices.

Frankel served in the Army during World War II in entertainment and as a member of an aerial crew. Life and career Frankel's direction of the off-Broadway production of Jean Genet's The Blacks was regarded as a crucial production in promoting African-American theater during the civil-rights movement which opened in 1961 and ran at St. Mark's Theatre for more than 1,400 performances, the longest-running Off-Broadway non-musical of the decade.Village Voice May 11, 1961, Vol. VI, No. 29 The cast included James Earl Jones, Roscoe Lee Browne, Louis Gossett, Jr., Cicely Tyson, Godfrey Cambridge, Maya Angelou and Charles Gordone; sets were by Kim E. Swados, music by Charles Gross, and costumes and masks by Patricia Zipprodt. He began his own career as an actor and was one of the earliest members of the Actors Studio. He moved behind the scenes and became a theater director on and off Broadway. His most notable Broadway production was Arthur Kopit's Indians starring Stacy Keach, who was nominated for the 1970 Tony Award as Best Actor for his portrayal of Buffalo Bill.Village Voice October 16, 1969, Vol. XIV, No. 53 The production was also nominated for a Tony Award for best play of 1970.

Gene Frankel Theatre As well as directing over 200 shows and managing at least twelve theaters throughout his career, Frankel taught acting, writing and directing. His last stage was the Gene Frankel Theatre and Film Workshop at 24 Bond Street in Greenwich Village. Frankel said that the heart of successful acting was, \\"Truth. I don't let my actors tell lies. The camera doesn't lie, the stage doesn't let you lie.\\" He was a visiting professor in theater at various institutions of higher learning including Columbia University, Boston College, and New York University. On August 4, 1973, his Mercer Arts Center, a complex of seven small theaters, which had been located on the first two floors of the residential Broadway Central Hotel, physically collapsed. Frankel, who had been conducting a rehearsal at the time, noticed the ceiling and walls beginning to buckle and heroically led the actors and several residents to safety; five people died in the collapse.New York Daily News, p. 1, Saturday, August 4, 1973New York Post, p. 1, Saturday, August 4, 1973The New York Times, pp. 13–15, Saturday, August 4, 1973 Only his last theater was a financial success, serving as home to artistic director Christopher Groenwald's New Mercury Players and as a satellite location for artistic director Marilyn Majeski's Grove Street Playhouse. =Gail Thacker= In 2003 Gene Frankel made Gail ThackerChanneling icon's spirit while trying to pay the rent.

He was the son of Prince Adam Ludwik Czartoryski (and grandson of Princess Marguerite Adélaïde of Orléans) and Countess Maria Ludwika Krasińska. After the death of his father, Prince Augustyn took over the running of the Family Museum and became ordynat of the Sieniawa Ordynacja properties. On 12 August 1937, he married Princess Maria de los Dolores of Borbon y Orleans, daughter of Prince Carlos of Borbon, Infant of Spain and Princess Louise of Orléans. Due to the prospect of war, the most precious objects were transported to Sieniawa Palace and walled up. The rest of the items were carried down to the Museum cellars, but in September as the bombs fell on Kraków Prince Augustyn and Princess Dolores, who was pregnant, decided to leave Sieniawa for a better refuge. On 18 September German troops found the cases and looted them. After the Germans moved on, Prince Augustyn removed all the treasures to his cousin's estate in Pełkinie saving them from the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, but the Gestapo traced all objects and removed all important cases from their hiding places. Soon after, Prince Augustyn and Princess Dolores were picked up by the Gestapo and put under arrest. After heavy negotiation, and thanks to their royal Italian and Spanish connections, they were deported and managed to reach Spain before the end of 1939. During his exile in Spain Prince Augustyn was very active in the Polish resistance, but his poor health and his desperation had its toll on his life.

The top stands in Wandlebury Country ParkWandlebury Country Park on CPPF's website , a nature reserve owned by Cambridge Past Present and Future, formerly known as the Cambridge Preservation Society. Wandlebury was already inhabited in the Bronze AgeOver the Hills to Cherry Hinton, H. C. Coppock, 1984, Plumridge, Linton, Cambridge, p.14. and 2500 years ago there was an Iron Age hill fort here known as Wandlebury Ring. This hill fort once had concentric ditches and earthen walls which were kept in place by wooden palisades. Although the fort has vanished, the ditch (the Ring) dug around the edge can clearly be seen and walked along, being 5 metres deep in places and offering an adventurous route along its edge. There is no evidence that it was ever used in defence. The reserve, mainly beech woodlands and fields, is a place for birdwatching. Banyard bird hide, overlooking Varley's Field, was completed in February 2012. Like Little Trees Hill, the summit is on public land and is accessible when sheep or Highland cattle are not in the field. Dogs must be on a lead everywhere in Wandlebury Country Park.

Wandlebury House Wandlebury House, home of among others Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin, stood within the Ring. The house has been demolished but the monumental stable block remains, now used for accommodation and as headquarters office of Cambridge Past Present & Future.

The first is the suggestion that an ancient hill figure had once been carved into the side of Wandlebury Hill, similar to the Cerne Abbas Giant. This was thought to have been overgrown or effaced in the 18th century. The figure was first recorded by Bishop Joseph Hall in 1605 and later by others including William Cole and John Layer. Investigation was carried out in 1954 by T. C. Lethbridge, an archaeologist and parapsychologist. He found small lumps of chalk to the south of the hill and proceeded to survey the area with a sounding bar, probing areas of soft ground and disturbed chalk. By placing markers he was able to draw out the pattern of what he claimed were 3 hill figures picturing ancient British deities - A horse Goddess (Magog or Epona), a Sun God (Gog, Bel, Belinus or Lucifer) and a warrior figure with sword and shield. The Times reported on Lethbridge's discovery as a \\"previously lost, three thousand-year-old hill-figure\\". A later article about Lethbridge's efforts was written by W.A. Clark in 1997 which did not confirm his claims, nor did magnometer and resistivity meter testing.Newman, Paul., Darvil, Tim., Lost Gods of Albion: The Chalk Hill Figures of Britain, pp. 114-125, The History Press, 2009 (earlier editions 1997, 1987). This suggestion was dismissed by Professor Glyn Daniel who commented that Lethbridge had not found any real antiquities but was \\"probably confusing geological features\\". A report by the Council for British Archaeology concluded that the 'hollows' were caused by common geological processes.Price, Simon., \\"The Gog Magog Hills\\"Fortean Times May 2006 Another Wandlebury Enigma dismissed by Glyn Daniel that was featured in a 1978 Sunday Telegraph article is the Line A Loxodrome or Cam Valley Loxodrome, a series of what retired geologist Christian O'Brien considered to be hand-carved stone monolith markers placed 1,430 metres apart between Wandlebury Earthworks and Portingbury Hills Mound at Hatfield Broad Oak, in Hatfield Forest. O'Brien stated that eleven of the original twenty-six stones are still in situ, with several others lying nearby. According to O'Brien local records indicate that at least one was moved due to it impeding modern agriculture. The names suggested for the stones featured include the Wandlebury Stone, Great Chesterfield Stone, Bordeaux Stone, Wendens Ambow Stone, Shortgrove Monolith, Newport Stone (also known as The Leper Stone), Springfield Stone, and the Priory Stone. The line forms a perfect rhumb line, so that wherever an observer stands on the line between Wandlebury and Portingbury, the North Star is always at the same oblique angle. Based upon this alignment, O'Brien believed that the line's builders possessed knowledge that the Earth was round, and also of its approximate circumference. Wilson, Colin., Starseekers, Doubleday, 1980 O'Brien believed it to have been created in the Bronze Age. O'Brien was following up a suggestion put forward by Alfred Watkins that the Wandlebury bank had astronomical purposes.Price, Simon., \\"The Gog Magog Hills\\" Fortean Times May 2006 According to O'Brien dents point from its exact centre to the North Star, the midsummer sunrise and the lunar summer maximum, he suggested probabilities for this and the markers being in the correct locations by pure chance were in the order of 10 million to one. By factoring in the Earth's drift, O'Brien placed the date of its construction around 2,500 BC. His hypothesis met with mixed comments. Interviewed by the Sunday Telegraph, Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge University dismissed the paper as \\"nonsense\\" and could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury. Archie Roy, Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow University commented that \\"in the absence of a more convincing explanation, this conclusion also has to be taken very seriously.” Alexander Thom stated that he believed it to be only an Iron Age Hill Fort.

Despite its name, the station is not located on London Road, which passes some southwest of the station and bears the name Preston Road at the nearest point.  History  London Road station was designed by David Mocatta (the designer of Brighton Station) and opened on 1 October 1877, following housing development in the surrounding area. It was originally to be called Ditchling Rise, a more accurate name as London Road is a little way away. Until the Kemp Town branch line closed in 1971, trains to Kemp Town diverged from the Brighton - Lewes line here. The Lewes-side platform building was demolished in the early 1980s. The station had a substantial refurbishment at the end of 2004 with some add on parts to the original building demolished. The station has also been home to the Brighton Model Railway Club since 1971.  Services  The typical off-peak service is: *4tph (trains per hour) to Brighton *2tph to Seaford *2tph to Lewes As of the new timetable, which was introduced in May 2018, the hourly Brighton to Ore service no longer calls here, as well as the newly introduced Brighton to Hastings express service.

Early life Adamson was born in Shildon, County Durham, on 30 April 1820. He was the 13th of 15 children – seven boys and eight girls – born to Daniel Adamson, landlord of the Grey Horse public house in Shildon, and his wife, Ann. Adamson was educated at Edward Walton Quaker School, Old Shildon, until the age of thirteen, when he left to become an apprentice to Timothy Hackworth, engineer to the Stockton and Darlington Railway, with whom he went on to serve as a draughtsman and engineer. By 1850, he had risen to become general manager of the Stockton and Darlington engine works (Soho Works, Shildon), and moved to become manager of Heaton Foundry in Stockport. Business Boiler for an engine made at Daniel Adamson & Co., Dukinfield c. 1900 In 1851 he established a small iron works in Newton, Cheshire, expanding it a year later by building a new foundry called the Newton Moor Iron Works on Muslin Street (now Talbot Road), between Hyde and Dukinfield. He specialised in engine and boiler making, initially following designs created by Hackworth, making and exporting the renowned \\"Manchester Boilers\\". Adamson was able to experiment with the newfound wealth from the worldwide export of these boilers which incorporated ring joints in the form of his patented Anti-Collapsive Flange Seam. He was also one of the pioneers of explosive forming used in the foundry process.Goodwin, J: Technology and culture Vol. 7, No. 2, pp. 268–300 (1964), Johns Hopkins University Press, 1966. ISSN 0040-165X In 1872 he designed and built the Daniel Adamson and Co factory, a new premises in Dukinfield next to Dewsnap Farm (off Dewsnap Lane), with its entrance on Johnsonbrook Road. This new works was approximately from the old foundry but the site was large and had enough spare land around it for any planned expansion. Between 1885 and 1888, Daniel Adamson and Co. supplied four narrow gauge steam locomotives to the Oakeley Quarry in Blaenau Ffestiniog, North Wales. He improved the design and manufacturing process (pioneering the use of steel and taking out 19 patents in the process) over the 36 years he was involved with boiler and other foundry manufacturing. When he died in 1890 the business employed some 600 people. Adamson's other business interests included a mill building company in Hyde ('The Newton Moor Spinning Company'), the Yorkshire Steel and Iron Works at Penistone, the Northern Lincolnshire Iron Company at Frodingham near Scunthorpe, and large share-holdings in iron works in Cumberland and South Wales. The ship canal project Adamson was a champion of the Manchester Ship Canal project. He arranged a meeting in Didsbury at his home, The Towers, on 27 June 1882, attended by 68 people including the mayors of Manchester and surrounding towns, leaders of commerce and industry, banker and financiers. Also present at the meeting was the canal's eventual designer Edward Leader Williams.Owen (1983), p. 26 Adamson was elected chairman of the provisional committee promoting the ship canal, and was at the forefront in pushing the scheme through Parliament in the face of intense opposition from railway companies and port interests in Liverpool. The requisite Act of Parliament enabling the canal was finally passed on 6 August 1885, after which Adamson became the first chairman of the board of directors of the Manchester Ship Canal Company – a post he held until February 1887. As a result of his resignation, the first sod was cut by his successor, Lord Egerton of Tatton, the following November.Farnie (1980), p. 4. Adamson remained a strong supporter of the project but did not live to see its completion in 1894. He died at home in Didsbury on 13 January 1890. Daniel Adamson and Co remained a family business until 1964, when it was sold to Acrow Engineers Ltd. Memorials Funerary monument of Daniel Adamson, Southern Cemetery, Manchester There are blue plaques at The Towers (today the Shirley Institute), Wilmslow Road in Didsbury, and in Adamson Street, Dukinfield. Also in Dukinfield, St Luke's Church has a stained glass window in his memory. The Adamson Military Band was also named after him. The Daniel Adamson Coach House has been preserved in Shildon. The former Manchester Ship Canal Company steam-powered tug-tender Daniel Adamson (built in 1903 as Ralph Brocklebank but renamed in 1936) has been restored by the Daniel Adamson Preservation Society and entered passenger-carrying service under steam on 22 April 2017. Adamson is buried at Southern Cemetery, Manchester, in grave space \\"A-Church of England-40\\". He was buried three days after his death at his home in Didsbury, on 16 January 1890. He was a founder member of the Iron and Steel Institute and served as its president in 1887. He was awarded the institute's Bessemer Gold Medal in 1888 for his work on the properties of iron and steel and the use of steel for steam boilers and other purposes. He was also a Member of the Institution of Civil Engineers, the Cleveland Institution of Engineers, the British Iron Trades Association, the Railway and Canal Traders' Association, the Geological Society of London, the Society of Arts, the Manchester Geographical Society, the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the Manchester Geological Society and others.

He became the head of the Czartoryski family after the death of his father in 1894. In 1897 he became Ordynat of the Sieniawa Ordynacja property. Capital assets were estimated at 4.5 million Austrian Crowns, which did not include the Family Collections.

In 1901 he married Countess Maria Ludwika Krasińska. His young wife took over the direction of affairs with tremendous determination, being a great heiress in her own right. In 1911 his brother Witold died and left Adam Czartoryski all his inheritance. In 1914 Czartoryski served in the Austrian Army, and his wife Maria Ludwika took over the Czartoryski Museum. During the First World War, thanks to family connections to the King of Saxony, she sent the most valuable objects over to Dresden. After the war, there was some difficulty retrieving the objects because of concern about unrest in Poland, but two years of negotiation, along with the 1919 Treaty of Riga which provided for the return of looted items, helped in reassembling the collection, a process which continued for the next several years. During this time the Hotel Lambert, their property in Paris, was transformed into apartments as the family had settled permanently in Poland.

The term \\"oculogyric\\" refers to the bilateral elevation of the visual gaze, but several other responses are associated with the crisis. Epilepsy can manifest as oculogyric seizures, also called versive seizures.Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia:Second Edition By Pierre Jallon, MD, Peter Kaplan, MB, FRCP, William Tatum, page 360 Signs and symptoms Initial symptoms include restlessness, agitation, malaise, or a fixed stare. Then comes the more characteristically described extreme and sustained upward deviation of the eyes. In addition, the eyes may converge, deviate upward and laterally, or deviate downward. The most frequently reported associated findings are backwards and lateral flexion of the neck, widely opened mouth, tongue protrusion, and ocular pain. However it may also be associated with intensely painful jaw spasm which may result in the breaking of a tooth. A wave of exhaustion may follow an episode. The abrupt termination of the psychiatric symptoms at the conclusion of the crisis is most striking. Other features that are noted during attacks include mutism, palilalia, eye blinking, lacrimation, pupil dilation, drooling, respiratory dyskinesia, increased blood pressure and heart rate, facial flushing, headache, vertigo, anxiety, agitation, compulsive thinking, paranoia, depression, recurrent fixed ideas, depersonalization, violence, and obscene language. It is often not realized that in addition to the acute presentation, oculogyric crisis can develop as a recurrent syndrome, triggered by stress, and exposure to the drugs mentioned below. Causes  Drugs that can trigger an oculogyric crisis include neuroleptics (such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, olanzapine), carbamazepine, chloroquine, cisplatin, diazoxide, levodopa, lithium, metoclopramide, lurasidone, domperidone, nifedipine, pemoline, phencyclidine (\\"PCP\\"), reserpine, and cetirizine, an antihistamine. High-potency neuroleptics are probably the most common cause in the clinical setting. Other causes can include Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency Korenke, GC; Christen, HJ; Hyland, K; Hunneman, DH; Hanefeld, F (1997). \\"Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency: an extrapyramidal movement disorder with oculogyric crises\\".

Rule out for phencyclidine addiction or craving in case patient may simulate signs of EPS to receive procyclidine Diagnosis The diagnosis of oculogyric crisis is largely clinical and involves taking a focused history and physical to identify possible triggers for the crisis and rule out other causes of abnormal ocular movements. Treatment Immediate treatment of drug induced OGC can be achieved with intravenous antimuscarinic benzatropine or procyclidine; which usually are effective within 5 minutes, although may take as long as 30 minutes for full effect. Further doses of procyclidine may be needed after 20 minutes. Any causative new medication should be discontinued. Also can be treated with 25 mg diphenhydramine.

It was directed by Norman Taurog, who had directed several previous Presley films. This was to be Taurog's final film, as he went blind shortly after production ended. Presley shares the screen with fellow legendary singing idol Rudy Vallee, whose career dated to the 1920s, but Vallee, in his late 60s, did not sing in the film. The film introduced the song \\"A Little Less Conversation\\", an alternate take of which would form the basis of a remix that returned Presley to international music sales charts in 2002. Plot Greg Nolan is a newspaper photographer who lives a carefree life until he encounters an eccentric, lovelorn woman named Bernice on the beach. Bernice assumes different names and personalities whenever the mood hits her. She introduces herself to Greg as \\"Alice\\" but she is known to the grocery delivery boy as \\"Susie\\" and to the milkman as \\"Betty.\\" After having her Great Dane dog Albert (which was reportedly Presley's real-life dog Brutus, though Priscilla Presley has stated that it was a trained dog used for the film) chase Greg into the water when he insults her after a kiss, Bernice invites him to stay at her beachfront home. She later manages to make him lose his job and apartment after drugging him, which leaves him in a deep sleep for days. However, Bernice also manages to find Greg another home. He wants to repay her, so he procures two full-time photographer jobs: one for a Playboy- like magazine owned by Mike Lansdown (Don Porter), and the other for a very conservative advertising firm co-owned by Mr. Penlow. The two jobs are in the same building, forcing Greg to run from one to the other without being detected. He also must deal with Bernice and her eccentric ways. Cast Background Based on the 1965 novel Kiss My Firm, But Pliant, Lips by Dan Greenburg, and with a screenplay co-written by Greenburg, Live a Little, Love a Little was a departure from the standard Presley films of the period. It had a more mature tone than other Presley musicals, with strong language, drug references and an implied sexual encounter. Presley was paid $850,000 plus 50% of the profits.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 Unlike many previous films that involved \\"location scenes\\" shot against a backdrop, Presley appeared in more real location scenes than usual. Scenes were filmed in and around Hollywood, along the Malibu coast, at Marineland and at the Los Angeles Music Center. The film co-starred Michele Carey, Don Porter, Rudy Vallee and Dick Sargent, and featured Presley's father Vernon in an uncredited cameo. Several of Presley's Memphis Mafia friends, such as Red West and Joe Esposito, also appeared. Released on October 23, 1968, the film failed to impress most critics. With a very poor performance on its American release, the film was not released in many regions, including in the U.K. Soundtrack Live a Little, Love a Little, the second of Presley's five final movies during the 1960s, included just a handful of musical numbers.

History Capri pants were introduced by fashion designer Sonja de Lennart in 1948, and were popularised by her and English couturier Bunny Roger. The name of the pants is derived from the Italian isle of Capri, where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s.\\"Ancient Capri Still Casts Its Powerful Spell\\". (29 June 2008).

The French actress Brigitte Bardot notoriously wore Capri pants at a time when trousers were still a new thing for women. Marilyn Monroe always travelled with Capris. Capris' acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s television series The Dick Van Dyke Show. The character Laura Petrie, the young housewife played by Mary Tyler Moore, caused a fashion sensation – and some mild controversy – by wearing snug-fitting capri pants during the show's run (Capris that were later referred to as 1950s hausfrau). By the mid 1960s, Capri-style tight-fitting cargo pants became popular among teenage boys; a good example was the superstar teen actor of that era, Luke Halpin, who wore them in some episodes of the popular Flipper. After a drop in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s, Capris returned to favour in the mid 2000s.

These are purported to represent a sun-god, a moon-goddess and a warrior-god. Lethbridge's claims, however, were controversial and are not widely accepted. Part of the chalk downs have been converted into a golf course since 1901 by the Gog Magog Golf Club,History of the Gog Magog Golf Club but much is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Magog Down In 1989 the Magog Trust, a charity and registered company created for the purpose, bought of former farmland surrounding Little Trees Hill for £327,100 so that it could be returned to chalk grassland and opened to the public. The reserve was named Magog Down.Magog Down website Some of the money to buy the land came from the sale of \\"Gogs\\" to the general public: these were notional areas of land costing £5 each but without title or rights.History of the Magog Trust As well as re-establishing chalkland plants and insects, Magog Down has become well used for recreation, and is very well used by dog walkers.Wagipedia entry for Magog Down A 5-mile running race involving two laps of the reserve and a shorter fun-run have helped raise funds for the local primary school for several years.Stapleford Fun Run website The Cambridge University Hare and Hounds running club have also used Magog Down as the venue for their tri- annual hosting of the RAF Match.RAF Match on CUH&H;'s website Magog Down is situated across the A1307 road from the Wandlebury country park (which itself has been managed since 1954 by Cambridge Past Present and Future).

Retrieved on 8 August 2017.  Naming  Locals tend to refer to the open access areas on these hills as simply the Gogs, usually in reference to Magog Down, though some people may also use the term to refer to Wandlebury Country Park. The local paper, Cambridge News, tends to refer to \\"the Gog Magogs\\" as a general term, lumping Wandlebury and Magog Down together. To further confuse matters, the adjacent Gog Magog Hills Farm Shop and Cafe re-branded itself in 2016 to be called \\"The Gog\\". The postal address \\"Gog Magog Hills\\" is shared by 16 addresses on the Gog Magog Hills Estate which are mostly within the grounds of Wandlebury Country Park.  Busway proposals  In February 2016 the Greater Cambridge City Deal (since renamed to Greater Cambridge PartnershipCity Deal homepage) published early-stage \\"concepts\\" for improved transport links along the A1307, which included the idea of a new, off-road busway apparently straight across the Gog Magog Hills, possibly through or adjacent to the edge of Magog Down. This concept was met with dismay by both Cambridge Past Present and Future and The Magog Trust.Magog Trust News article, February 2016 Later that month reassurances were made that any busway would not go through the hills; the formal consultation document in June 2016 still included an off- road busway option, albeit with the line on the map drawn slightly further South from Magog Down. The preferred options following the 2016 consultation were stated to include an in-bound (towards Cambridge) bus lane alongside the A1307, however by October 2017 the proposal for an off-road busway was back on the agenda again.GCP press release, 23 October 2017 See also * Army Manoeuvres of 1912 * Beechwoods nature reserve * Chalk Group * East Cambridgeshire * Guildhall, London for the characters Gog and Magog.

Early life and career Lola Falana was born in Camden, New Jersey. She was the third of six children born to Bennett, a welder and Cleo Falana, a seamstress (1921–2010). Lola Falana's father, an Afro-Cuban, left his homeland of Cuba to serve in the U.S. Marine Corps, later becoming a welder shortly after meeting Falana's mother who was African-American. By the age of three Lola Falana was dancing, and by age five she was singing in the church choir. In 1952, Lola Falana's family which by this time included two more siblings, moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. By the time she was in junior high school, Falana was already dancing in nightclubs to which she was escorted by her mother. Pursuing a musical career became so important to her that, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of Germantown High School a few months before graduation and moved to New York City. Career In 1958, Lola Falana's first dancing gig was at age sixteen during a Dinah Washington nightclub appearance in Philadelphia in which Washington gave her the opening act slot to perform. Washington, dubbed the \\"Queen of Blues\\", was influential in fostering Falana's early career. While dancing in a chorus line in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Falana was discovered by Sammy Davis Jr., who gave her a featured role in his 1964 Broadway musical Golden Boy. After the musical, Falana launched her music career later in 1964. Her first single, \\"My Baby\\", was recorded and released for Mercury Records in 1965. Later in her career, she recorded under Frank Sinatra's record label. In the late 1960s, Falana was mentored by Sammy Davis, Jr. In 1966, Davis cast Falana, along with himself, Ossie Davis, and Cicely Tyson, in her first film role, in A Man Called Adam. Lola Falana became a major star of Italian television, from 1966, and cinema, beginning in 1967. In Italy she learned to speak fluent Italian while starring in three movies, the first of which was considered a spaghetti western. She was a showgirl for Saturday night main TV show Sabato sera, next to acclaimed singer Mina. She was known as the \\"Black Venus\\". During this time she was busy touring with Davis as a singer and dancer, making films in Italy, and reprising her role in Golden Boy during its revival in London. In 1969, Lola Falana ended her close working relationship with Sammy Davis Jr., though the two remained friends. \\"If I didn't break away,\\" She told TV Guide, \\"I would always be known as the little dancer with Sammy Davis Jr. ... I wanted to be known as something more.\\" In 1970, she made her American film debut in The Liberation of L.B. Jones and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actress for her performance. That same year she posed for Playboy magazine. She was the first black woman to model for the Faberge \\"Tigress\\" perfume ads. In those early years, she also starred in a few movies considered to be of the blaxploitation genre. She appeared at the Val Air Ballroom sponsored by Black Pride, Inc., in 1978.Falana with Gino Bramieri on the Italian TV show Hai visto mai?, 1973. American TV audiences became familiar with Lola Falana during the early 1970s. She often appeared on The Joey Bishop Show and The Hollywood Palace, displaying her talent for music, dance, and light comedy. These appearances led to more opportunities. She was the first supporting player hired by Bill Cosby for his much-anticipated variety hour, The New Bill Cosby Show, which made its debut on September 11, 1972 (her 30th birthday) on CBS. Cosby had met Lola Falana in his college days, when he was a struggling comic and she was a 14-year-old dancing for $10 a show in Philadelphia nightclubs. Throughout the mid-1970s, Lola Falana made guest appearances on many popular TV shows, including The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Muppet Show, Laugh-In and The Flip Wilson Show. She also starred in her own television specials. In 1975, Lola Falana's disco record There's A Man Out There Somewhere reached #67 on the Billboard R&B; chart. That same year, she returned to Broadway as the lead in the musical Doctor Jazz. Although the production closed after just five performances, Falana was nominated for a Tony Award and won the 1975 Theater World Award. With help from Sammy Davis, Jr., she brought her act to Las Vegas and became a top draw there. By the late 1970s, Falana was considered the \\"Queen of Las Vegas\\". She played to sold-out crowds at The Sands, The Riviera, and the MGM Grand hotels. Finally The Aladdin offered her $100,000 a week to perform. At the time, Falana was the highest paid female performer in Las Vegas. Her show ran twenty weeks a year and became a major tourist attraction. While still playing to sold-out crowds in Las Vegas, Falana joined the cast of a short-lived CBS soap opera, Capitol, as Charity Blake, a wealthy entertainment mogul. In 1983, Falana was appearing at Bally's hotel and casino in Atlantic City and, while playing baccarat, won a minority stake in the New York Mets, a stake she held until she sold it in 1988 for 14 million dollars to Frank Cashen. =Later career and life= In 1995, Lola Falana recorded the song \\"Don't Cry, Mary\\" with Catholic artist Joseph Lee Hooker. No longer performing, she now tours the country with a message of hope and spirituality. When not on tour, she lives a quiet life in Las Vegas working on the apostolate she founded, The Lambs of God Ministry. The ministry is focused on helping children who have been orphaned in Sub-Saharan Africa, and works closely with the group Save Sub-Saharan Orphans.Catholic Exchange, \\"Former Entertainer Lola Falana Founds New Catholic Apostolate\\", August 31, 2002 Lola Falana's last known musical performance was in 1997, at Wayne Newton's theater in Branson, Missouri. Personal Sometime during 1965–1968, Lola Falana had an affair with her then–mentor Sammy Davis Jr. which became public knowledge after Davis confessed it to his then–wife May Britt, which led to their divorce in 1968. Lola Falana was married to Feliciano \\"Butch\\" Tavares Jr., one of five brothers of the popular R&B;/soul vocal band Tavares in 1970; later divorcing in 1975. =Health problems= In 1987, Lola Falana suffered a severe relapse of multiple sclerosis. Lola Falana's left side was paralyzed, she became partially blind, and her voice and hearing were impaired. Her recovery lasted a year and a half, during which she spent most of her time praying. Lola Falana attributes her recovery to a spiritual experience which she described as \\"Being able to feel the presence of the Lord.\\" Falana converted to Roman Catholicism in 1988 and worked her newly found spirituality into her daily life. Though she performed again in Las Vegas shows in 1987, Falana's practice of religion and faith became the center of her life. After another bout with multiple sclerosis in 1996, Falana returned to Philadelphia and lived with her parents for a short time. Cultural references * In D.C.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 19, 1996. In the episode, Homer is shocked to find classic rock is no longer considered cool. Hoping to earn \\"street cred\\", he joins the Hullabalooza music festival as a carnival freak. The episode's title is a play on the Lollapalooza music festival. It was the last Simpsons episode written by Brent Forrester and the last one directed by Wes Archer. Peter Frampton and musical groups Sonic Youth, Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins guest star as themselves. Plot After Otto destroys the school bus, Homer is forced to carpool several students to school. He is shocked to find all the kids hate the classic rock radio station he listens to. Homer realizes that music from his high school days is no longer considered cool after a hipster at a record store derides it. Hoping to impress them, Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Hullabalooza music festival. Homer tries to act cool by wearing a Rastafarian hat, but an angry crowd of Generation Xers confronts him after mistaking him for a narc. After being tossed out by the crowd, Homer angrily kicks a cannon, which shoots one of Peter Frampton's inflatable pigs at his stomach. The festival head is impressed by Homer's ability to absorb cannon fire and hires him for the festival's freak show (played by the Jim Rose Circus). Homer tours with the festival and parties with rap and rock stars — Sonic Youth, Cypress Hill and The Smashing Pumpkins — while earning respect among young people, including Bart. As the tour approaches a stop in Springfield, Homer's stomach aches and he is sent to a veterinarian. The doctor informs Homer he will die if he takes another cannonball to his gut. Homer decides to perform his act one last time, but he dodges the cannonball at the last second. After a warm sendoff from the touring bands, Homer leaves the festival and loses his kids' respect for no longer being cool, which he embraces. Production The entire story of this episode was developed by David Cohen, although it was written by Brent Forrester, who felt that Cohen at least deserved a \\"story by\\" credit. To do research for this episode, Forrester went to one of the Lollapalooza concerts, which he thought would be a fun little perk, but ended up being a horrible experience. Several of the jokes in this episode are based on his experiences: cameras were being seized and thrown in the garbage, there were numerous advertisements, several \\"sour faced teens\\", a real freak show (Jim Rose Circus), and at one point a stranger approached Forrester and asked, \\"how's it going, narc?\\". During Homer's confrontation with the Hullabalooza crowd, there is a brief shot of Homer with the members of the musical group No Doubt behind him. Gwen Stefani's brother Eric Stefani, who himself had been a member of the band, was working as an animator at The Simpsons at the time and added them in. =Casting= Sonic Youth threatened to not appear in the episode if Courtney Love was cast in it. The writers were aiming to have artists that represented several genres: hip hop (Cypress Hill), alternative rock (Sonic Youth, Smashing Pumpkins), and a classic rock singer. Originally, Bob Dylan was sought for this role, but he was replaced by Peter Frampton. Billy Corgan impressed the production staff by doing strong impersonations of Homer and Marge, though it was decided to not have him use them in the episode. Pearl Jam was asked to appear in the episode but declined. Originally, Courtney Love and Hole were wanted for this episode, but they declined. According to the DVD commentary an unnamed group had said that if Courtney Love were in the episode, they would not be. An Entertainment Weekly article revealed that the group was Sonic Youth.HOMERIC VERSE EW.com. Published May 10, 1996, Retrieved on February 8, 2007 It was thought that Love would appear in the episode because she had recently done a film with James L. Brooks, but she never responded to the request. Love was wanted specifically for one joke which would be in an exchange between her and Homer: > Courtney Love: Hi Homer! I'm a big fan, Courtney Love. > Homer: Homer Grateful! However, she did not appear and the joke was reworded for Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins: > Billy Corgan: Billy Corgan, Smashing Pumpkins. > Homer: Homer Simpson, smiling politely. Cultural references The flashback where Homer meets the guys in the van is based on the film Dazed and Confused. Several of the scenes where Homer is hit with a cannonball are based on famous stock footage of Frank \\"Cannonball\\" Richards being hit with a cannonball, as is the entire concept of a \\"cannonball catcher\\". Otto's drug-induced hallucination of his \\"talking shoes\\" is based on the opening of the album version of the song \\"1999\\" by Prince. Homer's walk in one scene parodies the walk in the Keep on Truckin' comic that was drawn by Robert Crumb. Reception The Rover Hendrix joke has been described by the show's writers as one of the worst jokes in The Simpsons history. In its original broadcast, \\"Homerpalooza\\" finished 57th in ratings for the week of May 13–19, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 7.8, equivalent to approximately 7.5 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and Married... with Children. In 1998, TV Guide listed it in its list of top twelve Simpsons episodes. The BBC website called the episode \\"One of the most memorable episodes, if not one of the greatest – the satire on youth counterculture is well handled, and Homer's flashback to his youth is fabulous.\\" and IGN said the episode was one of the best of season seven.The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes, Page 1 IGN.com In 2019, Consequence of Sound ranked it the third greatest episode on its list of top 30 Simpsons episodes.

Bill Oakley has said that Peter Frampton is one of his favorite guest stars and he wished he could have done a TV show with him. Alternatively, the Rover Hendrix act break joke has been called one of the worst jokes in The Simpsons history by the writers and producers. In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed the Smashing Pumpkins' and Cypress Hill's performances among the 33 funniest cameos in the history of the show.

Founded in 1976, Exodus International originally asserted that conversion therapy, the reorientation of same-sex attraction, was possible.Help Dennis Jernigan Visit The Troops In Iraq — Exodus International In 2006, Exodus International had over 250 local ministries in the United States and Canada and over 150 ministries in 17 other countries. Although Exodus was formally an interdenominational Christian entity, it was most closely associated with Protestant and evangelical denominations. In 2012, then president Alan Chambers renounced conversion therapy, saying it did not work and was harmful. The following year, Chambers closed the organization and apologized for the \\"pain and hurt\\" participants of their programs had experienced. Several other prominent former members, including John Paulk, have made similar apologies. While Exodus International no longer operates, many of its member ministries continue to do so, either forming new networks, joining existing ones such as the Exodus Global Alliance or operating independently. History During the presidency of Sy Rogers in the 1990s, Exodus International had offices on five continents and declared that \\"all homosexual relationships are sinful.\\" =Day of Truth= In 2007, Exodus International began supporting the Day of Truth, an event created by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) in 2005 that challenges homosexuality. In 2009, the ADF announced they had passed on their leadership role for the event to Exodus. In October 2010, Exodus announced they would no longer support the event. President Alan Chambers stated they realised they needed to \\"equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they'd like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not\\", adding that the Day of Truth was becoming too divisive. Chambers said that Exodus had not changed its position on homosexuality, rather they were reevaluating how to best communicate their message. Focus on the Family subsequently took leadership of the event, and renamed it the Day of Dialogue. =Love Won Out= In 2009, Exodus International purchased the Love Won Out conferences from Focus on the Family. The conferences purpose was \\"to exhort and equip Christian churches to respond in a Christ-like way to the issue of homosexuality.\\" Love Won Out maintained that \\"[t]he sin of homosexual behavior, like all sins, can be forgiven and healed by the grace revealed in the life and death of Christ. All sexual sin affects the human personality like no other sin, for sexual issues run deep into our character, and change is slow and uphill - but is possible nonetheless.\\"Focus on the Family's Love Won Out Conference Guide Copyrighted 2005-2006 Love Won Out ceased to exist when Exodus International closed. =Renunciation of conversion therapy= In January 2012, Alan Chambers announced during his address to a Gay Christian Network conference, that \\"the majority of people that I have met, and I would say the majority meaning 99.9% of them have not experienced a change in their orientation,\\" and apologized for the previous Exodus slogan \\"Change Is Possible\\".Alan Chambers: 99.9% have not experienced a change in their orientation While he believed that \\"any sexual activity outside a heterosexual, monogamous marriage is sinful according to the Bible\\", he was attempting to disassociate the group from \\"reparative therapy\\" and also step back from contentious political engagement. Speaking to the New York Times in July 2012, Chambers talked about how he believed gay people can have gay sex and still go to heaven. \\"But we've been asking people with same-sex attractions to overcome something in a way that we don't ask of anyone else [with other sins].\\" In a shift in the organization's previous positions, Chambers stated in June 2012 that conversion therapy is potentially harmful to those participating and it does not work:nytimes.com, July 7, 2012. Closure On May 28, 2013, Exodus International withdrew from the Exodus Global Alliance. On June 19, following a vote of the seven member Board of Directors at the organization's annual meeting in Irvine, California, the board of directors announced the impending closure of Exodus International.Melissa Steffan, \\"Alan Chambers Apologizes to Gay Community, Exodus International to Shut Down\\", 6/21/2013, http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2013/june/alan-chambers-apologizes- to-gay-community-exodus.html?paging=off Alan Chambers said that the board made the move \\"after a year of dialogue and prayer about the organization's place in a changing culture.\\" Chambers repudiated one part of the organization's mission in a nearly hour-long talk at Exodus International's 38th annual meeting:Tenety, Elizabeth, \\"Exodus International, criticized for ‘reparative therapies’ for gay Christians, to shut down\\", Washington Post, June 20, 2013.

Chambers stated that his next ministry would be different: \\"Our goals are to reduce fear and come alongside churches to become safe, welcoming and mutually transforming communities\\". Board member Tony Moore issued a statement that clarified that the decision is \\"not negating the ways God used Exodus to positively affect thousands of people,\\" further explaining that \\"a new generation of Christians is looking for change—and they want it to be heard.\\" The organization's local affiliates may continue to operate independently under a name other than Exodus. Chambers appeared on Lisa Ling's Our America show, broadcast on the Oprah Winfrey Network, in a June 20, 2013 episode entitled \\"God and Gays.\\" Ling stated in a media interview prior to the airing of the episode, \\"I think Alan was sincere in his apology. I think things are happening so quickly and he's going through a transition. Where they leave the organization has yet to be determined.\\" The decision of the three member Board of Directors resulted in the closure of \\"Exodus International\\" as an umbrella organization, but had no direct impact on the member ministries which continue to operate. Many have joined together to form two new networks, including Restored Hope Network; while others continue to operate independently. Additionally, some former member ministries publicly expressed disagreement with the Board of Directors, Alan Chambers, and his apologies.Melissa Steffan, \\"After Exodus: Evangelicals React as Ex-Gay Ministry Starts Over: A roundup of responses to Alan Chambers’s apology and Exodus International’s shutdown and reboot after nearly four decades of ministry.\\", Christianity Today, 6/21/2013, http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/june-web-only/exodus-international- alan-chambers-apologize-for-exgay-past.html A close affiliate to Exodus International was the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), who issued a statement saying the member ministries of Exodus \\"still exist and we imagine that they will always exist as long as we have individuals who find homosexual sex incongruent with their personal or religious values\\". Studies of Exodus participants While there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that conversion therapy is both a pseudoscience and harmful to participants, some studies finding support for the practice have been published. Several studies of Exodus participants, conducted by people in favor of conversion therapy, found that the therapy could be successful. =Jones and Yarhouse= Professors Stanton L. Jones of the evangelical Christian Wheaton College and Mark Yarhouse authored a paper that studied whether people \\"who participate in focused religious ministries experience a change in their sexual orientation\\" and whether such programs are harmful. Results found, from a sample of 73 participants (98 before dropouts), that 15% had successfully converted to heterosexuality, 23% \\"reported homosexual attraction to be present only incidentally\\" and 29% had \\"modest decreases in homosexual attraction\\". No significant change was reported by 27% of participants; 12% reported giving up on conversion therapy, and 8% subsequently identified as homosexual. Jones and Yarhouse's study found \\"no evidence that the type of attempt to change sexual orientation studied here is harmful.\\" Response Dwight Panozzo from New York University stated that there were several flaws in the Jones and Yarhouse study, the most prominent of which was the decision not to exclude participants who were likely to benefit financially from the study finding in favor of conversion therapy. According to Panozzo, these participants would have been more likely to report successful results, thereby \\"undermining the validity of the findings\\". Panozzo also said while their methods used to conclude there was no harm caused by conversion therapy had \\"an impressive level of face validity\\", these findings could not be accepted. Among several other criticisms, Panozzo states that Jones and Yarhouse did not have a baseline from which to measure harm, adding that \\"from a research perspective, this [was] a cardinal and insurmountable error.\\" =Schaeffer et al.= Schaeffer et al. surveyed 140 members of Exodus, also from an evangelical perspective. According to the study, after a year, 29% said they had changed their orientation, and another 65% said they were in the process of changing. Participants were considered behaviorally successful if they had abstained from any type of physical homosexual contact in the past year. Success was associated with strong religious motivation and positive mental health. Change was positively associated with religious motivation and emotional well-being. This study was published in the Journal of Psychology & Theology, which aims to marry conventional psychology with evangelical Christian orthodoxy. =Ponticelli= Research by Ponticelli on 15 ex-lesbian women found that Exodus helped them change their lesbian identities through a combination of a new and compelling schema concerning sexuality, reinterpretation of one's past according to that schema, and social support. Controversy There have been several controversial incidents regarding Exodus and their leaders; Christianity Today reported in 2007 that scandals had become less frequent. =Michael Bussee and Gary Cooper= Michael Bussee, one of the founders of Exodus and Gary Cooper, a leader within the ministry of Exodus, left the group to be in a relationship with each other in 1979. They divorced their wives and participated in a commitment ceremony in 1982. Bussee and Cooper lived together until Cooper's death from AIDS-related illness in 1991. In June 2007, Bussee issued an apology for his involvement in promoting orientation change through Exodus. Also apologizing were Jeremy Marks, former president of Exodus International Europe, and Darlene Bogle, the founder of Paraklete Ministries, an Exodus referral agency. The apology stated in part \\"Some who heard our message were compelled to try to change an integral part of themselves, bringing harm to themselves and their families.\\" Bussee stated, \\"In the almost 40 years since I started Exodus International, I can honestly say that I have never met a gay person who became heterosexual through conversion therapy or ex-gay programs. Yes, some stayed celibate for a time. Some even married and said they were happy. But most of those marriages ended with very painful divorces.\\"Bussee, Michael, \\"#BornPerfect – Michael Bussee,\\" National Center for Lesbian Rights, 2020.Gonzales, Daniel, \\"Exodus Co-Founder: I Never Saw One Of Our Members Become Heterosexual,\\" Box Turtle Bulletin, 27 Apr. 2010. (Video on YouTube.) =John Paulk= In September 2000, John Paulk, who had been elected Chairman of the board of Exodus International North America since August 1995, was identified drinking at a Washington, D.C. gay bar. A patron recognized him and contacted Wayne Besen, an employee of the Human Rights Campaign, who came to the bar and confronted Paulk. Paulk denied who he was and gave an alias, but was photographed as he left the bar. When confronted by Besen about the incident and the photographs later, Paulk admitted being in the bar, but stated that he did not know it was a gay bar and had simply stopped in to use the restroom. He later conceded he had known it was a gay bar before entering. Paulk was subsequently removed as board chairman by Exodus. In 2013, Paulk renounced his former cause, stating that his sexual orientation had never truly changed, that reparative therapy does not work and \\"does great harm to many people\\". =Billboard parody= In March 2006, Liberty Counsel, a law firm acting on behalf of Exodus International, sent cease-and-desist letters to bloggers Justin Watt and Mike Airhart, demanding they \\"immediately cease use\\" of an edited photograph on their respective blogs \\"or in any other form\\" which parodied an Exodus billboard. The original billboard image, obtained from Exodus's website, consisted of the message \\"Gay? Unhappy? www.exodus.to\\" while the parody image, created by Watt in September 2005, showed the same sign, substantially cropped, with the text altered to read \\"Straight? Unhappy? www.gay.com.\\" In response, Watt contacted the ACLU, who took his defense. Exodus decided against pursuing further legal action once the Exodus logo was removed from the parody. As a result of the media attention, more than 40 other websites began displaying the parody. =iPhone app= In 2011, Exodus International released an iPhone app which promoted the idea that homosexuality can be cured. In the app, Exodus quoted research by scientist Gary Remafedi. Remafedi, however, stated that Exodus had manipulated and misused his research, and wrote to Apple founder Steve Jobs and interim CEO Tim Cook informing them of this. On March 24, 2011, Apple spokesman Tom Neumayr stated: \\"We removed the Exodus International app from the App Store because it violates our developer guidelines by being offensive to large groups of people.\\" Petitions to both remove and keep the app were set up on Change.org. On March 24, 2011, The Register reported that while the petition to remove the app had received over 150,000 signatures, the counter petition to keep the app had only received 8 signatures. =Ugandan conference= In 2009, Exodus International board member Don Schmierer and two other evangelical Christians traveled to Uganda to speak at a conference on homosexuality, informing thousands of attendees that homosexuality was \\"evil\\" and could be \\"cured\\". A month later a Ugandan politician, with the help of the organizers of the conference, introduced what became known as the \\"Kill the Gays\\" bill. If passed, the bill would have made homosexuality punishable by death. Close to a year later, Chambers expressed regret for the organization's involvement, and spoke out against the proposed bill.

Biography Carrillo was born on January 28, 1875, in Ahualulco, a village in the state of San Luis Potosí. He was the last of the 19 children of Nabor Carrillo and Antonia Trujillo. =Early education= Carrillo sang in the children's choir of Ahualulco's church. The choir's conductor, Flavio F. Carlos, encouraged him to study music in the state capital, San Luis Potosí. He planned to study for two years, then return to Ahualulco as the church's singer, but problems prevented this plan. He arrived to San Luis Potosí City in 1885 and began to study with Flavio F. Carlos, teacher to several generations of San Luis Potosí's composers. Carrillo also began to work in his teacher's orchestra where he was a percussionist and later, violinist. He composed his first small works for this group. Because of his family's financial situation, Carrillo left his primary school studies early, but continued working in the orchestra and studying music with Carlos. In 1894, Carrillo composed a mass that was locally successful. This, along with a letter of recommendation from the government of San Luis Potosí, allowed him to go to study in the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City. Carrillo made quick progress in the Conservatory. His professors included Pedro Manzano (violin), Melesio Morales (composition), and Francisco Ortega y Fonseca (physics, acoustics, and mathematics). Having not completed primary studies, he was ignorant of the acoustic basis of music--so he was fascinated when Ortega discussed laws governing generation of fundamental intervals in music. For example, when a violin string is depressed (stopped) at its midpoint, it produces a pitch twice the frequency of (an octave above) the open string. When a string is stopped at one-third, the remaining two-thirds vibrates a perfect fifth higher than the open string (almost exactly equivalent to 5/8 of an octave). Carrillo explored these relationships in experiments. For a while he tried, but couldn't divide the string further than into eight equal parts. Then he left the traditional way of dividing the string into two, three, four, five, six, seven and eight equal parts, and, using a razor to stop the string, divided the fourth string of his violin between G and A into sixteen parts. He could produce sixteen clearly different sounds within a whole tone. From then on, he immersed himself in the study of the physical and mathematical basis of music. In 1899, General Porfirio Díaz, President of Mexico, heard Carrillo as a violinist. Díaz was impressed, and gave him a special scholarship to study in Europe. =Studies abroad= Carrillo was admitted to the Leipzig Royal Conservatory, where he studied with Hans Becker (violin), Johann Merkel (piano), and Salomon Jadassohn (composition, harmony and counterpoint). He became first violin in two orchestras: the Conservatory's Orchestra, conducted by Hans Sitt; and the Gewandhaus Orchestra, conducted by Arthur Nikisch. Carrillo composed several works at Leipzig, including Sextet in G Major for two violins, two violas and two violoncellos (1900), and the First Symphony in D Major for Orchestra (1901). Carrillo conducted the Leipzig Royal Conservatory Orchestra in the premiere performance of his First Symphony. In 1900, Carrillo attended the International Congress of Music in Paris, presided by Camille Saint-Saëns. He presented a paper, which the Congress accepted and published, on the names of musical sounds. He proposed that, since each note is one sound, each note name (C, D flat, etc.) should be a single syllable. He proposed 35 monosyllabic names. He also befriended Romain Rolland.Mena, María Cristina (1914). \\"Julian Carrillo: The Herald of a Musical Monroe Doctrine\\", pp. 755–756, The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Vol. 89: pp. 753–???. Josiah Gilbert Holland and Richard Watson Gilder, eds. Digitized 2008. When he finished his studies in the Leipzig Conservatory, he went to Belgium to improve his skills as a violinist. There, he studied with Hans Zimmer (who had been Eugène Ysaÿe's student) and was admitted to the Ghent Royal Conservatory of Music. In 1903, he composed a Quartet in E minor, which he intended to give, \\"ideological unity, [and] tonal variety,\\" to classical forms.Mena, María Cristina (1915). \\"Julian Carrillo: The Herald of a Musical Monroe Doctrine\\", Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine, Volume 89, p. 758. Scribner. . =Return to Mexico= In 1904, he won the First Award Cum Laud and with Distinction in the Ghent Conservatory International Violin Competition. Later that year he returned to Mexico where President Díaz gave him an Amati violin \\"as a present from the Mexican Nation\\" for his excellent performance in foreign countries. In Mexico City, Carrillo began intense work as violinist, orchestra conductor, composer and teacher. He was appointed professor of history (1906), composition, counterpoint, fugue and orchestration in 1908 by the National Conservatory. Among his students was José Francisco Vázquez Cano who founded the Free School of Music and Declamation, the Faculty of Music of the National University (UNAM) and the National University Philharmonic Orchestra (OFUNAM). Other notable students were Antonio Gómezanda (pianist and composer), Rafael Ordoñez, Rafael Adame, Vicente Teódulo Mendoza (researcher of the Mexican folklore), Gerónimo Baqueiro Foster (composer and music historian and critic), Daniel Ayala, José López Alavés (composer of the famous Mexican song Canción Mixteca), Rosendo Sánchez, Leticia Euroza, Angel Badillo, Felipe Cortés Texeira, Agustin Oropeza, and Gabriel Gómez. Carrillo organized and conducted the Beethoven Symphony Orchestra (1909) and the Beethoven String Quartet (1910). He published Discursos sobre la música (Discourses on music, 1913) and Pláticas musicales (Musical talks, 1914 and 1922). In 1910 he performed for the first time his Canto a la Bandera (Song to the Flag, with lyrics by Rafael López), which has been since an official song to the Mexican Patriot Flag. In 1911 Carrillo was official delegate to both the Musical Congress of Rome and the Musical Congress of London. At the first, he presented a report, \\"Reforming the great forms of composition to give symphony, concert, sonata and quartet ideological unity and tonal diversity\\". At the second congress, he argued a need to improve the artistic level of military bands. Each report was approved by its respective congress. In 1913 Carrillo was nominated Principal of the National Conservatory. There he amended the curriculum, putting more emphasis on rigorous musical technical preparation as well as literature and Spanish language. That year he was admitted as a member of the Mexican Society of Geography and Statistics. =Birth of the \\"Thirteenth Sound\\"= When Victoriano Huerta's government was overthrown, Carrillo had to flee to the United States. In New York City, he organized and conducted the American Symphony Orchestra. He performed his First Symphony in New York. The success of this work was so great that a journalist named him \\"the herald of a musical Monroe Doctrine\\". In 1916, Carrillo composed music for D. W. Griffith's film, Intolerance. In New York, Carrillo also wrote the \\"Thirteenth Sound Theory\\" which was published later in the second volume of Musical Talks. =Return home= In 1918, he came back to Mexico, where he was chosen to conduct the National Symphony Orchestra (1918–1924) which had been the Conservatory's Orchestra. He was also named Principal of the National Conservatory (1920–1921). Carrillo led the National Symphony Orchestra to performance excellence. Renowned pianist Leopold Godowsky said the orchestra was superior to the New York Philharmonic Orchestra. The National Symphony Orchestra was so popular, it could be sustained by its own economic resources. With his orchestra, Carrillo introduced Mexico to the music of Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Weber, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Richard Strauss, Saint-Saëns, Debussy and Ravel. He directed two Beethoven Festivals in 1920 and 1921. He also introduced Mexican composers Manuel M. Ponce, Antonio Gómezanda, Juan León Mariscal, and himself, among others. In 1920, Julián Carrillo described his Thirteenth Sound Theory through the Mexican press and in conferences. It stated that, given the evolution of the musical system, the next step of musical composition must be the use of intervals smaller than half tones. He cited examples from his earlier experiments. The Thirteenth Sound Theory was not well received. Some enthusiastic people (most of them Carrillo's students) supported it, but others attacked it and its author. They said it was impossible to perceive such little intervals but, even if possible, Carrillo had stolen the idea from European musicians. The main opponent was \\"Group 9\\", consisting of seven musicians, a physician, and a lawyer. Carrillo's followers organized themselves as \\"Group 13\\". The two groups confronted each other to defend their positions through press, broadcasts and conferences. This debate is known as the Thirteenth Sound Polemic and was supported principally by the Mexico City's daily El Universal. The polemic culminated with a concert by the Group 13 on February 15, 1925. The program included several compositions of Carillo and his students in quarter-, eighth- and sixteenth-tones, performed with adapted instruments and specially trained voices. From September to November 1925, Carrillo made a Thirteenth Sound excursion through several cities of the country. In December 1925, Carrillo presented the Thirteenth Sound in Havana. In 1926 he arrived in New York City. There, he edited a few issues of the bilingual musical magazine The Thirteenth Sound: The Herald of America's Musical Culture. The League of Composers commissioned a microtonal work. He wrote the Sonata casi fantasía in quarter-, eighth- and sixteenth- tones. It was performed for the first time in Town Hall on March 13, 1926. Then, Leopold Stokowski commissioned a Carrillo work, the Concertino in quarter-, eighth- and sixteenth-tones, which Stokowski and the Philadelphia Symphony Orchestra performed in New York and Philadelphia. At that time, Carrillo wrote Leyes de Metamórfosis Musicales (Musical Metamorphosis Laws), a method to transform the tonal proportions of a work. For example, half tones become whole tones and whole tones become double tones; or half tones become quarter tones and quarters become eighths, and so on. In addition, these laws present a compositional process similar to serialism. He also wrote Pre-Sonido 13: Rectificación básica al sistema musical clásico—Análisis físico musical (Pre-Thirteenth Sound: Essential Rectification to classical musical system—Physical musical analysis) and Teoría lógica de la música (Logical Theory of Music). When he came back to Mexico, State of San Luis Potosí's government honored him for the Thirteenth Sound. It declared July 13 (anniversary of the 1895 experiment) as State Day of Honor. The National Flag was raised over Carrillo's house from 6 am to 6 pm. Despite governmental recognition, Carrillo didn't receive economic support for his musical revolution. Opponents put obstacles to his working as a conductor and professor of music. After that, he rarely was invited to conduct in Mexico and his music seldom performed. The former Principal of the National Musical Conservatory and titular Conductor of the National Symphony never obtained similar jobs again, in spite of his abilities and experience. He had to pay for his own musical research, making musical instruments, publishing his compositions, et cetera. In 1930, Carrillo organized the Thirteenth Sound Symphony Orchestra, in which all the musical instruments could perform microtones. From 1930 to 1931 Carrillo and Leopold Stokowski conducted this orchestra. In New York City on February 7, 1930, Ángel Reyes, principal of the Thirteenth Sound Group of Havana, recorded the Preludio a Colón (Prelude to Christopher Columbus) for the Columbia label.\\"Columbia matrix 98677: Preludio a Cristobal Colón / 13th Sound Ensemble of Havana; Angel Reyes\\", Discography of American Historical Recordings (accessed 1 October 2017) That year, the town of Ahualulco was officially renamed Ahualulco del Sonido 13. In 1934, Carrillo published La revolución musical del Sonido 13 (The Thirteenth Sound Musical Revolution), which gave the historical background of his revolution. In 1940 he published another book, Génesis de la Revolución Musical del Sonido 13 (Genesis of the Thirteenth-Sound Musical Revolution). =Pianos and metamorphosis= In 1940, Carrillo patented fifteen metamorphoser pianos for producing whole tones, third-tones, quarter-tones, fifth-, sixth-, seventh-, eighth-, ninth-, tenth-, eleventh-, twelfth-, thirteenth- fourteenth-, fifteenth-, and sixteenth-tones. Each piano produced one set of intervals but all of these pianos have sets of 96 keys unlike common pianos. The piano with quarter-tones could produce four full octaves and the piano with sixteenth- tones only one. In contrast, Wyshnegradsky's piano for quarter-tones has three sets of 88 keys. In 1941 Carrillo published Método racional de solfeo (Rational method of solfeggio). Its guiding idea is that a person has to proceed from known things to discover new things. So his exercises for singing are variations on the Mexican National Anthem. In 1947 he conducted experiments at New York University examining the node law that prevailed at the time and showed that it had to be modified. His reasoning followed from the fact that a node is not a mathematical point but a physical point. If a violin string is stopped below halfway, the frequency of the bowed fraction is more than twice the frequency of its base note. Carrillo later extended his work on musical physics (the node law and harmonic law) in Dos leyes de física musical (Two laws of musical physics, Mexico City, 1956)In 1949, the first metamorphoser piano was made for third-tones and Carrillo brought it to the Paris Musical Conservatory the next year. In France, he met Jean-Étienne Marie, who spread Carrillo's theories in Europe. Carrillo lectured in France, Spain and Belgium. In 1951 Carrillo produced a concert in the Esperanza Iris Theatre of Mexico City to demonstrate the musical metamorphosis laws. That year, in Pittsburgh, Leopold Stokowski performed for the first time Horizontes: Poema sinfónico (Horizons: Symphonic Poem for violin, cello and harp in quarter- eighth- and sixteenth-tones). The concert was so successful that Stokowski had to repeat the complete work. Next year, Stokowski performed Horizontes in Washington, Baltimore and Minneapolis. In 1954 he donated a metamorphoser piano for third-tones to the Schola Cantorum of Paris. In 1956, France's President decorated Carrillo with the badge of Knight of the Legion of Honor. Germany's government decorated Carrillo with the Great Cross of the Order of Merit. In 1958 Carrillo showed his 15 metamorphoser pianos at the Brussels' World Exposition. They won a gold medal. Then the pianos were shown in the Gaveau Hall in Paris. Julián Carrillo, Ivan Wyschnegradsky and Alois Hába met in Paris where they were all participating in the International Congress of Music that year. Carrillo performed in concert at UNESCO. =Last years= Tomb of Julian Carrillo in the Panteon Civil de Dolores cemetery in Mexico City From 1960 to 1965 Carrillo recorded about thirty musical works with the Lamoureaux Concerts' Association Symphony Orchestra with renowned French musicians like Jean-Pierre Rampal, Bernard Flavigny, Robert Gendre, and Reine Flachot. These records were made by Philips in Paris. Jean-Etienne Marie was the sound engineer. In 1960 Carrillo composed his Canon atonal a 64 voces (Atonal Canon for 64 Voices); the Misa de la Restauración dedicada a Juan XXIII (Mass of the Restoration dedicated to Pope John XXIII for male voices a capella in quarter-tones); Balbuceos (Babbles for metamorphoser piano in sixteenth-tones and orchestra). This last work was commissioned by Leopold Stokowski and performed for the first time in Houston. In Paris during 1963, Carrillo won the Great Award of Latin American Music. He lectured in the Mexican Embassy in London and was interviewed by the BBC. The Times of London published an article from their Mexico City correspondent: > The grand old man of Mexican music, Julián Carrillo, has spent his life > peering into an unsuspected microtonic world of sound. He has shattered and > then remade our chromatic scale, and we might be tempted to call him the > atom-splitter of music, except that the name gives no idea of the rich > emotional world he has opened. … This was a more startling revolution than > when Terpander, in Greece 26 centuries ago, added two notes to the Chinese > five-tone scale.Anon., \\"The Musical Revolution of Don Julián Carrillo\\", The > Times, issue 55659 (Tuesday, 26 March 1963): 15, col A. In 1964 Robert Gendre premiered Carrillo's First Violin Concerto in quarter- tones. That year, Carrillo wrote several works: three sonatas for viola in quarter-tones, a Sonata for violin in quarter-tones, the Second Violin Concerto in quarter-tones, and several atonal canons. Mexico's government awarded him the Civic Merit Medal because of the anniversary of the Canto a la Bandera (Song to the National Flag). In 1965 the USSR invited Carrillo to perform several concerts across the country, but he died before it could be a reality. He also won the Sibelius Award of Finland, with the support of the most important musical institutes of France, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, but his death prevented his receiving it personally. Carrillo died in Mexico City on September 9, 1965. His body was placed in the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres (the Rotunda of Illustrious Persons) of the Panteón de Dolores.

Education and early practice After growing up in northern Hungary, Dr. Hora received medical degrees from Royal Hungarian University in Budapest in 1942, and from Charles University in Prague, Czechoslovakia in 1945. He performed his residency in psychiatry at Budapest General Hospital and Carlsbad City Hospital in Carlsbad, Czechoslovakia. In 1952, Dr. Hora established private practices in New York City and in Bedford Village, New York. For the next fifteen years, he was active in professional psychiatric circles in the U.S. and in Europe, and published several articles. In 1958, in recognition of his contributions to his field, he received the Karen Horney Award for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis. Development of metapsychiatry However, at about this time, Dr. Hora was inspired to look for alternative solutions to psychological problems and life issues. Dissatisfied with orthodox treatments for mental illness, he investigated alternate cures and treatments, soon leading him to spiritual literature. Dr. Hora is described as having read the sacred texts and major writings of many major world religions, including Zen Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism, and Judaism. In addition to the literature of the world's major religions, Dr. Hora also read from an extensive list of philosophers, both existentialist and classical. He is also said to have met with Carl Jung, Alan Watts and a Zen master to ask questions and seek guidance, incorporating many of their thoughts into his work. The teachings of Jesus became especially important to Dr. Hora's formulation of metapsychiatry, and many of his books (such as Beyond the Dream: Discourses on Metapsychiatry and Spiritual Guidance ()) drew heavily from Jesus' teachings. Dr. Hora continued to teach and provide mentorship until shortly before his death on October 30, 1995. His teachings continue to be promulgated through the PAGL (Peace, Assurance, Gratitude, and Love) Foundation , which continues to publish his works.

It is known for its connection to Rennyo, the founder of the Ikkō sect of Japanese Buddhism. The site is a National Historic Site.Agency for Cultural Affairs In 1457, Rennyo was appointed as the eighth chief abbot of Hongan-ji, on the outskirts of Kyoto Under Rennyo's leadership, Hongan-ji began to expand the teachings of Shinran's Pure Land Buddhist even to areas beyond the capital. However, the rapid growth of Hongan-ji was met with hostility by the orthodox Tendai sect based at Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, and in 1465, Hongan-ji was destroyed by militant monks from Enryaku-ji and, and Rennyo was forced to flee from Kyoto. In 1471, he re-established Hongaki- ji at the small village of Yoshizaki on the border of Echizen Province with Kaga Province. His rectory, known as the \\"Yoshizaki-gobō\\" was the location from which he sent out many letters explaining the teachings of his version of the Pure Land faith, known as the Ikkō-shū, in colloquial Japanese, and was the location at which he reformed the ritual practices of the sect. It was also from this location that he implemented his vision of reforming society by creating a semi-theocratic republic, in which the traditional feudal landlords were replaced by communal landholding by lay followers of the sect, and led by the priesthood. The town of Yoshizaki had residences for both priests and lay followers and provided lodgings and other services, and rapidly attracted large numbers of pilgrims mainly from the northern provinces as far away as Dewa and Ōshū. However, Rennyo's success at Yoshizaki, drew hostility from the traditional political authorities. The Yoshizaki-gobō burned down in 1474 and again in 1475. After this, Rennyo left Yoshizaki and returned to Kyoto. The Yoshizaki Hongan-ji continued to be used by his followers and the Kaga ikki movement until it was destroyed by the forces of the Asakura clan in 1506 in their suppression of the movement. A new temple was built on the site in 1747, belonging to the Ōtani-branch of the Jōdo Shinshū movement.

Evidence suggests that Jefferson planned to instruct architecture students himself, but he died in 1826 before his vision could be realized. It would take more than 100 years after Jefferson's death for the School of Architecture to be formed. In 1919, a School of Fine Arts was established under the direction of Sidney Fiske Kimball, for whom the university's Fine Arts Library is named. In 1954 the university dissolved the School of Fine Arts, merging it into the College of Arts and Sciences, and creating a new School of Architecture. In the nine decades since its founding, the school has grown from an initial enrollment of eleven students to some 350 undergraduate and 175 graduate students, with 54 full-time faculty members and an extensive staff. Facilities  The school is located in Campbell Hall, and includes studio space, lecture halls, classrooms, the Fine Arts Café, and the Arts & Architecture Store (colloquially known as the A&A;). A decade-long program entitled \\"Campbell Constructions\\" was created by Dean Karen Van Lengen (1999-2009). She invited Architecture and Landscape Architecture faculty to contribute to the renovation and rejuvenation of the school and its grounds. Eleven projects were completed during this ten-year period, ranging from furniture to interior renovations, as well as building additions and outdoor projects and landscapes. Van Lengen led the planning and oversight of the designs. This series of projects was also part of a larger redevelopment program at the university. The two building expansions and landscape designs were collaborative design efforts between the faculty offices and SMBW Architects, the \\"Architects of Record\\" for all of the major additions and landscape projects. These expansions added some 12,000 square feet (1,100 m²) to accommodate the school's growth over the previous two decades. The South Addition, by faculty member Bill Sherman, provides office space along the south side of the building. A series of landscape interventions accompany the South Addition, designed by Warren Byrd (Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects). The Elmaleh East Wing, by faculty member W. G. Clark, provides additional space for reviews and exhibits. The new additions were dedicated in October 2008. The original building, by Pietro Belluschi, was completed in 1970.\\"School of Architecture shines with Campbell Hall additions\\" (October 25, 2008), Daily Progress. Rankings  In the 2012 rankings by the journal DesignIntelligence, the school's architecture program tied for first place among public Master of Architecture programs and ranked seventh overall. U.Va. is also the top program among public and private universities in the South. The program has been ranked the first or second public Master of Architecture program three times in the last 10 years, and in the top five publics of the last 10 years. The Master of Architecture program has the lowest tuition of any top-10 program ranked by DesignIntelligences 2012 report. The graduate landscape architecture program is ranked third in master's programs at public universities and fifth overall. In a survey of deans and administrators, U.Va.'s Master of Landscape Architecture program ranked third overall, second for research and theory, fourth in design communication and cross-disciplinary teamwork, and fifth in computer applications. The program has consistently remained in the top six of public programs and top 15 overall since 2005. The Planetizen 2012 Guide to Graduate Urban Planning Programs ranked U.Va.'s program in Urban and Environmental Planning seventh in the nation.

Ex-Mormons—sometimes referred to as exmo or postmo—may neither believe in nor affiliate with the LDS Church. In contrast, Jack Mormons may believe but do not affiliate; and cultural Mormons may or may not affiliate but do not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the LDS Church. The distinction is important to a large segment of ex-Mormons, many of whom consider their decision to leave as morally compelling and socially risky. According to 2014 Pew data, around 1/3 of adults raised LDS no longer adhere to the faith (up from around 10% in the '70s and '80s) and in 2008 only 25% of LDS young adults are actively involved. Many ex-Mormons experience troubles with family members who still follow Mormon teachings. Aggregations of ex-Mormons may comprise a social movement. Reasons for leaving Most ex- Mormons leave Mormonism and the LDS Church because specific intellectual or spiritual reasons have led them to a conviction that the religion is false. The foremost reasons are disbelief both in Joseph Smith as a prophet and in the Book of Mormon as a religious and historical document. Reasons for this disbelief include issues with anthropological, linguistic, archaeological, and genetic evidence against the Book of Mormon in the New World. In addition to rejecting the Book of Mormon for such reasons, the Book of Abraham and other Mormon religious texts are rejected on similar grounds. A study of 3000 people who were formerly affiliated with the LDS Church recorded that 74 percent of respondents cited a disbelief in church doctrine or theology as major reason for leaving the church, but only 4 percent of respondents cited conflict with other church members as a large factor in their decision to leave. Also, just 4 percent claimed that a significant reason for apostasy was dissatisfaction with the rules of conduct professed by the LDS Church. This corroborates the assertion that many Mormons are satisfied with the communal aspect and attributes of LDS Church life. Individuals leave Mormonism for a variety of reasons, although \\"single reason disaffiliates are rare among former Mormons.\\" Research shows that 43 percent of ex-Mormon left due to unmet spiritual needs. Other reasons for leaving may include a belief that they are in a cult, logical or intellectual appraisal, belief changes or differences, spiritual conversion to another faith, life crises, and poor or hurtful responsiveness by Mormon leaders or congregations. Of former Mormons surveyed, 58 percent switched to other faiths or practices. Those who adopt humanist or feminist perspectives may view certain Mormon doctrines (including past teachings on the spiritual status of black people, polygamy, and the role of women in society) as racist or sexist. A minority of ex-Mormons cite their personal incompatibility with Mormon beliefs or culture. A 2003 Princeton Review publication quoted a student at church-owned Brigham Young University as stating, \\"the nonconformist will find a dull social life with difficulty finding someone that will be their friend, regardless of who they are or what they believe.\\" Liberal views and political attitudes that challenge this conformity, and occasionally sexual orientation, are cited as reasons for leaving Mormonism. In recent years, the LDS Church has become more politically active, particularly with regard to legislation barring civil marriage for same-sex couples. Official church involvement in the California Proposition 8 campaign was highly controversial, causing some Mormons to stop attending church. Post-disaffiliation issues After their decision to leave Mormonism and the LDS Church, ex-Mormons typically go through an adjustment period as they re-orient their lives religiously, socially, and psychologically. =Religious= An online poll of ex-Mormons found that a majority of ex- Mormons do not self-identify as a member of another faith tradition, choosing to describe themselves as agnostic, atheist or simply ex-Mormon. Some can also become apatheist. A Pew Research report corroborated this, finding in 2015 that 36% of those born Mormon left the religion, with 21% of born Mormons (58% of ex-Mormons) now unaffiliated, 6% evangelical Protestant, and 9% converting to other Protestant, Catholic, or a non-Christian faith. Others either retained belief in God but not in organized religion or became adherents of other faiths. Among ex-Mormons with no current religious preference, 36 percent continued the practice of prayer often or daily. Ex-Mormon attitudes toward Mormons and Mormonism vary widely. Some ex-Mormons actively proselytize against Mormonism, while some provide only support to others leaving the religion. Other ex-Mormons prefer to avoid the subject entirely, while still others may try to encourage healthy dialogue between adherents of their new faiths and active Mormons. Attitudes of ex-Mormons also differ regarding their church membership. Some formally resign, which the LDS Church refers to as \\"name removal,\\" while others simply stop attending church services. =Social= Ex-Mormons who publicly leave Mormonism often face social stigmatization. Although many leave to be true to themselves or to a new belief structure, they leave at a cost; many leave feeling ostracized and pressured and miss out on major family events such as temple weddings. Family members of some may express only disappointment and sorrow and try to reach out in understanding to their new belief system or lack thereof. Some stay under threat of divorce from spouses that still believe. Still, many ex- Mormons are completely shunned and have given up spouses, children, and the ability to enter Mormon temples to witness life events of family members. Ex- Mormons in geographic locations away from major enclaves of Mormon culture such as Utah may experience less stigmatization, however. =Psychological= A good number of ex-Mormons go through a psychological process as they leave Mormonism. Former Mormon Bob McCue described his disaffiliation as recovery from cognitive dissonance. Reynolds reports that leaving involves a period of intense self-doubt and depression as disaffiliates confront feelings of betrayal and loneliness, followed by self-discovery, belief exploration, spiritual guidance and connection as they leave Mormonism. He argues that leaving may provide a renewed sense of self, confidence and peace. One ex- Mormon compared his disaffiliation experience to leaving a cult, while others called it close to overcoming mind control or adjusting to life outside of religious fundamentalism. Still others compare their symptoms to divorce from marriage. Ex-Mormons may also have to cope with the pain of ostracism by Mormon employers, friends, spouses, and family members.What did leaving cost you? (collection of forum posts), exmormon.org, further studies would need to be done to compare exmormons with ex members of other religious communities in order to see if the psychology of an ex mormon is unique. Ex-Mormon organizations Many formerly LDS individuals (sometimes called post-Mormon or ex-Mormon, \\"postmos\\" or \\"exmos\\" respectively) seek community and discussion about their former beliefs in online and in-person groups. Some of these international groups include the ex-Mormon page on Reddit (with over 175,000 subscribers) as well as various group listings on the Mormon Spectrum website. Localized groups include the SLC Postmos meetup and Facebook group (with over 2,000 members) and Utah Valley Postmos meetup and Facebook group (over 900 members). The ex-Mormon subreddit gained publicity with its involvement leaking LDS documents. Latter-day Saint views of ex-Mormons Depending on the circumstances of an ex-Mormon's departure, Latter-day Saint views may range from considering them apostates to viewing them as individuals who have simply strayed from the path. The LDS Church teaches that people leave for a variety of reasons. Reasons range from trivial to serious (including doctrinal disagreements). Latter-day Saints view \\"denying the Holy Spirit\\" as having potentially devastating spiritual consequences, and they generally hope ex- Mormons will \\"return to the fold.\\" =Reasons for leaving= The reasons given for a person leaving the church vary according to who is offering the opinion. LDS Church Sunday School manuals say members leave because of unwarranted pride, committing sins which drive them to alienation from God, or because they have taken offense to something trivial. A 2003 manual claims members leave because they have been deceived by Satan, who, according to Mormon scripture, is actively seeking to destroy the souls of men. Furthermore, those who \\"depart from the truth\\" will be judged in the final judgment for falling prey to this deception. The deceptions that Satan uses include acceptance of a false prophet, pride and vanity, being critical of leaders' imperfections, being offended, rationalizing disobedience, and accepting the false teachings of the world. In the Book of Mormon, a figure named Korihor preaches disbelief and challenges prophecies and church leaders. He then demands a miracle and is miraculously struck mute for the acts. One Mormon scholar likened the philosophical analysis employed in an essay compilation edited by an ex-Mormon to Korihor's tactics. Church authority and popular LDS fiction writer Gerald N. Lund compares any reasoning that leads to disbelief in God or Mormonism to Korihor. Mormon historian B. H. Roberts wrote of an account of a member leaving the LDS Church over the misspelling of a name in church records. The LDS Church has used the story of Frazier Eaton (who gave $700 for the Kirtland Temple but left after being unable to get a seat at the dedication ceremony) as an object lesson on how members can leave after being offended. In October 2013, Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught: \\"The search for truth has led millions of people to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. However, there are some who leave the Church they once loved. One might ask, 'If the gospel is so wonderful, why would anyone leave?' Sometimes we assume it is because they have been offended or lazy or sinful. Actually, it is not that simple. In fact, there is not just one reason that applies to the variety of situations. Some of our dear members struggle for years with the question whether they should separate themselves from the Church. In this Church that honors personal agency so strongly, that was restored by a young man who asked questions and sought answers, we respect those who honestly search for truth. It may break our hearts when their journey takes them away from the Church we love and the truth we have found, but we honor their right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own conscience, just as we claim that privilege for ourselves.\\" url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2013/10/come- join-with-us?lang=eng =Consequences of leaving= Early Latter-day Saints were taught to consider ex-Mormons as stronger candidates for eternal damnation based on their former devotion to Mormonism, since those who were never adherents will be judged more lightly. The LDS Church taught \\"When individuals or groups of people turn away from the principles of the gospel, they are in a state of apostasy.\\" In addition, one who goes so far as to deny the Holy Spirit could become a son of perdition and be cast into outer darkness. Outright apostasy of members will lead to a church disciplinary council, which may result in disfellowshipment or excommunication. However, members who ask for their names to be removed from church records or who have joined another church are not subject to a disciplinary council. Brigham Young, a president of the LDS Church from 1847 to 1877, taught that members who openly disagree with church leaders are cursed or condemned and that those who reject Mormon doctrine or authority outright are \\"apostate\\". An early Mormon epistle teaches that apostates have \\"fallen into the snares of the evil one.\\" Although sometimes mistaken for a direct quote from Joseph Smith, this passage occurs in the book as part of \\"Excerpts from an Epistle of the Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad\\", edited by Oliver Cowdery and Frederick G. Williams as published in the Evening and Morning Star. Young also said that \\"[if] there is a despicable character on the face of the earth, it is an apostate from this Church. He is a traitor who has deceived his best friends, betrayed his trust, and forfeited every principle of honor that God placed within him. They may think they are respected, but they are not. They are disgraced in their own eyes. There is not much honesty within them; they have forfeited their heaven, sold their birthright, and betrayed their friends.\\"  See also  *Religious disaffiliation *Exmormon Foundation *Lost boys (Mormon fundamentalism) *Lapsed Catholic *List of former or dissident LDS *Stay LDS *PostMormon Community *Blogs about Mormonism or Mormons *:People excommunicated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints *Ed Decker References Further reading * External links * *The Exmormon Foundation - an organization dedicated to supporting those in transition from Mormonism *Recovery from Mormonism - the most prominent ex- Mormon community on the web *MormonNoMore - Information on how to resign from the LDS Church *Utah Lighthouse Ministry - Founded by ex-Mormons Jerald and Sandra Tanner Disengagement from religion Latter Day Saint terms Mormon, Ex ","title":"Ex-Mormon"},{"id":"1780581","text":"William Worthington Scranton III (born July 20, 1947) served as the 26th lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania from 1979 to 1987 in the administration of Governor Richard Thornburgh. He is the son of the late Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton, and a member of the wealthy and politically influential Scranton family, the founders of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Early life Scranton was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of the late Pennsylvania Governor William Scranton and the late First Lady of Pennsylvania Mary Scranton. He attended Yale University. After college he became the editor of a local newspaper in Mountaintop, Pennsylvania. In 1970, he went to Europe to study Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Transcendental Meditation, and became a lifelong practitioner of the Transcendental Meditation technique. He then became president and managing editor of the Greenstreet News Company. He entered politics as a member of the Republican State Committee in 1976. Political career =Lieutenant Governor 1979–1987= Scranton (L) and Oran Henderson (R) at a press conference In 1978, he won the Republican primary for lieutenant governor and later that year became the youngest person ever elected lieutenant governor in Pennsylvania. His dual role as chairman of the Governor's Energy Council and chairman of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Council put him at the center of the Three Mile Island crisis in 1979. As lieutenant governor, Scranton hired Nat Goldhaber, a member of the Transcendental Meditation movement, as his top aide in Harrisburg. In 1982, he was unanimously elected as Chairman of the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors. =Candidate for governor 1986= During his final term as lieutenant governor, Scranton ran for Governor of Pennsylvania in 1986 against Democratic former Auditor General Bob Casey Sr.. The race was virtually tied until five days before election day when Casey's media consultants, led by a young James Carville, launched the now-infamous \\"guru\\" ad. This television advertisement portrayed Scranton as having been a regular drug user in the 1960s and mocked Scranton's interest in transcendental meditation and his ties to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The image of Scranton as a \\"long haired, dope- smoking hippie\\" is seen by political observers as having tipped the scales against Scranton in the socially conservative rural sections of Pennsylvania. Casey went on to win the election by a narrow margin of 79,216 out of 3.3 million votes cast. =Candidate for governor 2006= On October 17, 2005, Scranton formally announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for Governor of Pennsylvania in 2006. After it became clear that Scranton would not win the Pennsylvania Republican Party endorsement, his campaign called for Pennsylvania change to an \\"open primary\\" election. Scranton dismissed his first two prior campaign managers over strategy issues. In January 2006 Scranton fired his third campaign manager, Jim Seif, after Seif criticized Scranton's African American opponent, Lynn Swann, during a television interview saying, \\"the rich white guy in this campaign is Lynn Swann.\\" In February 2006, after his request for an open primary was denied, Scranton withdrew from the race. Private sector After losing the 1986 election, Scranton exited politics and managed some California companies and start-up firms. He returned to Pennsylvania in 1994 to spend time with his family. Scranton served on the board of directors for a number of Pennsylvania companies. He was Chairman of the Board of the Harleysville Group of Insurance Companies. He also co-founded and co-chaired the Great Valley Technology Alliance. In 1992, Scranton donated $1,000 to the campaign of his friend John Hagelin, the Pittsburgh-born presidential candidate for the Transcendental Meditation-backed Natural Law Party. Scranton says he has always supported Republicans. He has maintained a presence in the political arena, creating a new political action committee (GrowPAC), speaking at the annual Pennsylvania Leadership Conference and testifying before the State House of Representatives budget hearing. In May 2007, Scranton joined the Board of Directors for the Commonwealth Foundation, a Harrisburg public policy research center. Scranton was a potential candidate in the 2010 gubernatorial election, but, in August 2009, effectively ended speculation he would enter the race by endorsing 6th district Congressman Jim Gerlach for governor.http://www.gerlachforpa.com/news/51 Notes External links *GrowPA: Agitate for Change (GrowPAC official website) *PA Comeback: Bill Scranton for Governor (official website) *Scranton going for governor again *Who did Scranton really support in 2004? * Scranton officially announces candidacy for governor 1947 births Living people American people of English descent Politicians from Scranton, Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governors of Pennsylvania Pennsylvania Republicans Transcendental Meditation practitioners ","title":"William Scranton III"},{"id":"1780585","text":"John Fitzgibbon or FitzGibbon may refer to: *John FitzGibbon, 1st Earl of Clare (1748–1802), Attorney-General and Lord Chancellor of Ireland *John FitzGibbon, 2nd Earl of Clare (1792–1851), Privy Councillor and Governor of Bombay *John Fitzgibbon (politician) (1845–1919), United Kingdom Member of Parliament for South Mayo (1910–1918) *John Fitzgibbon (Cork hurler) (born 1967), Irish hurler *John Fitzgibbon (Limerick hurler) (born 1992), Irish hurler  See also  *John Fitzgibbons (1868–1941), U.S. Representative from New York ","title":"John Fitzgibbon"},{"id":"1780586","text":"Joseph Michael Jurevicius (born December 23, 1974) is a retired American football wide receiver. He was drafted by the New York Giants in the second round of the 1998 NFL Draft. He played college football at Penn State. Jurevicius played for the Giants, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Seattle Seahawks, and Cleveland Browns. He earned a Super Bowl ring with the Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII, and also played in Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XL as a member of the Giants and Seahawks respectively. Early years Jurevicius attended St. Justin Martyr School in Eastlake, Ohio, and Lake Catholic High School in Mentor, Ohio, and was a letterman in football as a wide receiver and punter, and in basketball, his #84 jersey is retired and hanging in the Lake Catholic gymnasium. College career Jurevicius played college football at Penn State University under head coach Joe Paterno. He finished his college career with 94 receptions for 1,905 yards and 15 touchdowns. Professional career =New York Giants= Jurevicius was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (55th overall) in the 1998 NFL Draft. He played four seasons with the New York Giants through the 2002 season. During his time in New York, he played in 58 games, scoring five touchdowns and totaling 1,442 receiving yards. He played in the Giants' 34–7 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, but did not record any receptions. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= In 2002, Jurevicius signed a four-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an unrestricted free agent. In the 2002 NFC Championship game against the Philadelphia Eagles, he took a crossing pattern 71 yards down to the Eagles' five-yard line. In Super Bowl XXXVII, Jurevicius led the Buccaneers in receiving yards with four catches for 78 yards as Tampa Bay won by a score of 48–21 over the Oakland Raiders. Tampa Bay is the first franchise from the NFC South to win the Super Bowl. Jurevicius left Tampa Bay following the 2004 season. He played in 30 games for the team, recording 874 yards receiving and eight touchdowns. =Seattle Seahawks= In 2005, Jurevicius signed with the Seattle Seahawks. He finished the regular season with a career-high 10 touchdowns with 694 receiving yards, leading the team in touchdowns and finishing second in yards. He also had a career-high 137 yards against the St. Louis Rams. He led the Seahawks in receiving with five catches for 93 yards in their 21–10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL. =Cleveland Browns= On March 11, 2006, Jurevicius signed a four-year contract with his hometown team, the Cleveland Browns. He became an immediate impact player as a dependable, sure-handed receiver—especially on 3rd-and-long situations. He finished the 2007 season with the third most 3rd-down receptions (29) in the league. In 2008, Jurevicius spent the preseason recovering from surgery on his right knee. Shortly after the initial surgery, he developed a staph infection and underwent five additional surgeries to eliminate the infection. He began the season on the Active/PUP list, and on August 25, he was transferred to the Reserve/PUP list, forcing him to miss the first six weeks of the regular season. Slow recovery prevented his availability before Week 10, which by NFL rules, made him ineligible to return for the remainder of the 2008 season. He was awarded the team's Ed Block Courage Award, given to the player who best persevered through injury. Jurevicius underwent a seventh surgery to clear out scar tissue in late 2008, vowing to return for the 2009 season. However, the Browns released him on March 11, 2009.Browns Release WR Jurevicius Yahoo Sports, March 11, 2009 On June 26, 2009, Jurevicius filed a lawsuit in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas naming the Browns, the Cleveland Clinic, and Browns team physicians, Dr. Anthony Miniaci and Dr. Richard Figler, as defendants. The suit alleged Jurevicius contracted staph in his right knee due to the Browns' failure to sterilize their Berea, Ohio training facility properly and the failure of doctors at the Cleveland Clinic to take proper precautions against infection. Five other Browns players and two staff members had contracted staph since 2003. The Browns and Cleveland Clinic confidentially settled with Jurevicius in 2010. Retirement The damage done to his knee effectively forced him into retirement. He now appears on the Tailgate Show on Cleveland Browns pre-game television. Jurevicius also appeared on two episodes of North American Hunter in 2013 hunting moose and bear in Newfoundland and British Columbia. In 2014, he opted to receive stem cell therapy on his knees. Personal life Jurevicius currently lives in Gates Mills, Ohio. He is of Lithuanian descent, has a tattoo of Vytis, the national symbol of Lithuania on his right biceps. He earned a degree in Human Development and Family Studies from Penn State University in 1997. He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated twice: August 25, 1997 and February 3, 2003. Jurevicius is an avid hunter. In 2007, he co-founded Dismal River Outfitters, a hunting ranch and resort in Mullen, Nebraska, with his former Buccaneer and Seahawk teammate, John Howell. His appearance on 'North American Hunter' chasing moose and spot-and-stalk bear is a further testament to his love of hunting and the outdoors. In June 2009, Jurevicius took part in the 2009 NFL/NFLPA \\"Broadcast Boot Camp,\\" a program designed by the NFL Broadcasting Department and their broadcast partners to prepare players for possible post-playing careers in broadcasting. Jurevicius now owns a company that deals with commercial construction of businesses.

They produced a moderately successful single with their song, \\"Open Up Your Door\\". History The Young Lions originally performed under the name, the Emeralds. When Richard Tepp saw the group perform, he was so impressed with the act, he joined the band, which resulted in changing their moniker to the Original Kounts. In addition to having a repertoire conceived of British Invasion cover versions, the band members became known as one of the more rebellious acts as a result of the bandmembers growing their hair long. After being discovered by Larry Brown, (a.k.a. L. Russell Brown) and Ray Bloodworth during a chance encounter in a Newark pizzeria and joining Bob Crewe Productions, the name was changed to Richard and the Young Lions. The core of the group consisted of Tepp (lead vocals and tambourine), Bob Freedman (rhythm guitar and vocals), Marc Lees (lead guitar and vocals), Norm Cohen (drums), Ricky Rackin (guitar and bass guitar), and Jerry Raff (piano). The Young Lions managed to produce one minor hit with their song \\"Open Up Your Door\\". The composition was the first ever recorded using an African hair drum and a fuzz bass. It reached number one in Cleveland, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Elyria, Ohio; and Salt Lake City, Utah; number two in Seattle, Washington and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; number three in Tucson, Arizona; and the Top 10 in many other cities in the US and Canada. Nationally, it peaked at number 99 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 24, 1966 and number 91 on the Record World Top 100 Pops chart on October 8, 1966. The corresponding Cash Box listing was at number 70 on October 22, 1966. The band made several television appearances including The Hy Lit Show and The Jerry Blavat Show out of Philadelphia, PA. They also appeared in the Detroit market on Robin Seymour's Swingin' Time show, out of Windsor, Ontario. A video of that appearance on Swingin' Time has survived to this day and can be found on line. And the band also made two appearances on the Upbeat TV show out of Cleveland, OH, hosted by Don Webster. Their follow-up release, \\"Nasty\\", was chosen and released in late December 1966 and became a regional hit, but did not match the sales of their debut single. The Young Lions' final single, \\"You Can Make It\\" was released in February 1967 and received extensive radio play. However, the record company refused to distribute the single to the public, so \\"You Can Make It\\" failed to chart. The band sought to compose their own tracks, however they were no longer backed financially which led to their disbandment. Original lead singer Richard Tepp died of Leukemia, on June 17, 2004. Film A documentary on the band was produced in 2004, entitled Out of Our Dens: The Richard and the Young Lions Story by James Hannon and Leon Leybs, and narrated by preeminent radio personality Pat St. John. It featured the group's history from their early days to their reunion shows in the early 2000s.

Beeger he had the possibility to extend the table of Lehmer beyond the number 10 006 721. 1955 he was awarded a gold medal and the order of the Republic of Italy by Italian president Giovanni Gronchi. In his long life (102 years) he was a member of the city council in the rank of Commissario Prefettizio. He was a poet in his native dialect Pontremolese (poems and texts for popular music). He wrote for example Al Campanon d‘ Pontrémal, La Zumniana (for which he also composed the music) or Al cant dal Cont Ugolìn. He translated XXXIII of \\"Dantes Inferno\\". As an amateur he wrote poems in Latin language.

Terminology * Ocean – the four to seven largest named bodies of water in the World Ocean, all of which have \\"Ocean\\" in the name. See Borders of the oceans for details. * Sea has several definitions: ** A marginal sea is a division of an ocean, partially enclosed by islands, archipelagos, or peninsulas, adjacent to or widely open to the open ocean at the surface, and/or bounded by submarine ridges on the sea floor. ** A division of an ocean, delineated by landforms, currents (e.g. Sargasso Sea), or specific latitude or longitude boundaries. This includes but is not limited to marginal seas, and this is the definition used for inclusion in this list. ** The World Ocean. For example, the Law of the Sea states that all of the World Ocean is \\"sea\\", and this is also common usage for \\"the sea\\". ** Any large body of water with \\"Sea\\" in the name, including lakes. * River - A small strip of water that foes inland * Tributary - A small river that flows into a larger one * Estuary - The piece of a river that flows into the sea or ocean * Strait - a narrow area of water connecting two wider areas of water, also sometimes known as a passage *Channel - Usually wider than a strait *Passage - Connects waters between islands, also sometimes known as a strait *Canal - Man-made channel *Fjard - A large open water between groups of islands There are several terms used for bulges of ocean that result from indentations of land, which overlap in definition, and which are not consistently differentiated: * Bay – generic term; though most features with \\"Bay\\" in the name are small, some are very large * Gulf – a very large bay, often a top-level division of an ocean or sea * Fjord – a long bay with steep sides, typically formed by a glacier * Bight – a bay that is typically shallower than a sound * Sound – a large, wide bay which is typically deeper than a bight, or a strait * Cove – a very small, typically sheltered bay * Inlet – A skinny bay that are like peninsulas but for the sea *Polynya – Least used out of all, Patch of water surrounded by ice Many features could be considered to be more than one of these, and all of these terms are used in place names inconsistently; especially bays, gulfs, and bights, which can be very large or very small. This list includes large areas of water no matter the term used in the name.

Chanter Sisters Chanter started as a member of a group called the Chanters in 1967 with her sister Irene Chanter and her five brothers, releasing four singles which failed to chart. In 1968, the Chanter sisters became a duo initially known as Birds of a Feather. The duo released four singles between 1967 and 1972 but none of them achieved chart success. Their first album was Birds of a Feather, released in 1970 and featuring Elton John on piano. The Chanter sisters had appeared as backing singers for John in a Radio 1 session. Long John Baldry asked the sisters to join his live band in 1973. They also featured on June 1, 1974, a live album featuring Nico, Brian Eno, Kevin Ayers and John Cale, and appeared on the Chris Farlowe album BBC Radio 1 Live in Concert. Both sisters are credited on the 1974 John Cale album Fear and, the same year, Ron Wood's album I've Got My Own Album to Do. Other credits include Manfred Mann's Earth Band's Solar Fire (1973), Nightingales and Bombers (1975), The Roaring Silence (1976) and Watch (1978), plus John Entwistle's Mad Dog (1975), Andy Fairweather Low's La Booga Rooga (1975), Chris Rea's Whatever Happened to Benny Santini? (1978) and Justin Hayward's Night Flight (1980). In 1976, Polydor released their second album First Flight, although it failed to make any lasting impression.

In 1976 her name was credited on Bryan Ferry's album Let's Stick Together, and the following year she appeared as a backing vocalist on another Ferry album, In Your Mind. In 1981, Chanter was part of a chorus that sang at The Secret Policeman's Ball, with other chorus members including Phil Collins, Donovan, Sheena Easton, Bob Geldof, Midge Ure and Tom Robinson. She also wrote two singles for Kiki Dee, released in 1981, and a song sung by Dee for the British television series Roll Over Beethoven in 1985. She made a cameo in the film Pink Floyd The Wall in 1982 as a vocalist in a choir and, with Irene, provided backing vocals on the Pink Floyd song, \\"Not Now John\\", from the band's 1983 album, The Final Cut. Also in 1983, both Doreen and Irene appeared as backing singers on The Undertones track \\"The Love Parade\\" on their The Sin of Pride album. The same year, Chanter provided vocals for the song \\"Say You're Sorry\\" from Ministry's With Sympathy.

Hora described it as \\"a scientific method of healing and education based on metaphysical concepts of man and the universe.\\"Hora, Dialogues in Metapsychiatry, page 1 Metapsychiatry was inspired by Hora's dissatisfaction with what he believed was psychoanalysis's failure to account for human spirituality,Tyrrell, page 76-77 and his observation that psychiatric healing was often temporary.Chervenkova, page 70 It is characterized by a hermeneutic approach,Hora, page 1 with precise definitions of psychological terms and conditions, and what it calls “spiritual reality.” Metapsychiatry borrows from Judeo-Christian, Zen Buddhist and Taoist religious traditions, along with theistic existentialist philosophy and phenomenology;Rinehart, page 50 similarities to Morita therapy have been noted.Chervenkova, pages 70-72 While the teachings of Christ are central, metapsychiatry is not aligned with a Christian denomination, refrains from valuing historical and sacramental teachings, and makes a distinction between religious practice and spiritual interest.Tyrrell, pages 77-82 God is perceived as \\"limitless, infinite and non-material.\\"Rinehart, page 54 Its style originates with the assertion that “the meaning and purpose of life are to come to know reality,”Leach which is defined as “God”, “Love-Intelligence” or “Infinite Mind.”Tyrrell, pages 78-79 Study of metapsychiatry includes implementation of “the two intelligent questions”, which seek to distinguish between experiential and spiritual existence. The first question is \\"What is the meaning of what seems to be?\\" The second question asks \\"What is what really is?\\" The aim is a reorientation from a preoccupation with material appearances toward the apprehension of spiritual reality.Tyrrell, page 78 Metapsychiatry maintains that the problems of humankind are based in ignorance, and may be overcome through \\"Knowledge of the truth of what really is.\\"Tyrrell, page 80 Problems are viewed as psychological; answers are spiritual.Menahem Metapsychiatry holds that suffering is the product of self-confirmatory thought, the insistence on affirming one's existence, and that relief from suffering is realized through enlightened transcendence of the material world.Rinehart, page 53 The qualities of peace, assurance, gratitude and love (PAGL) are cited as indicating a state of spiritual consciousness.Hora, pages 8, 38 Notes References *Chervenkova, Velizara, Japanese Psychotherapies: Silence and Body-Mind Interconnectedness in Morita, Naikan and Dohsa-hou, Springer, December 26, 2017 * Hora, Thomas, Dialogues in Metapsychiatry, PAGL Press, Orange, California, August 1, 1986 *Leach, Michael, 25 Really Good Reasons to Love the Faith, Live the Faith, and Share the Faith, Loyola Press, September 1, 2016 *Menahem, Sam, The Great Cosmic Lesson Plan: Healing Through Spirituality, Humor and Music, Balboa Press, Mar 18, 2015 *Rinehart, Christie Walter, Love and Compassion, 2009 *Tyrrell, Bernard, Christotherapy II: The Fasting and Feasting Heart, Wipf and Stock Publishers, March 11, 1999 Further reading * Hora, Thomas, Existential Metapsychiatry, PAGL Foundation, August 1, 2002 * Hora, Thomas, Beyond the Dream: Awakening to Reality, Crossroad, October 1, 1996 * Kerievsky, Bruce S., Metapsychiatry and the Elusive Truth of Being, Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 39, No. 1 (Spring, 2000), pp. 51-55 External links * pagl.org * The Meta View Psychotherapy Spirituality ","title":"Metapsychiatry"},{"id":"1780644","text":"Edmund Burke Fairfield (August 7, 1821 – November 7, 1904) was an American minister, educator and politician from the U.S. state of Michigan. He served as the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan and as the 2nd Chancellor of the University of Nebraska. Early life Fairfield was born in Parkersburg, Virginia, now West Virginia. He moved with his family to Troy, Ohio when he was a young boy. He received an early education at Denison University of Granville and in 1837 he attended Marietta College of Marietta. He graduated from the congregationalist-affiliated Oberlin College of Oberlin in 1842. He then worked as a tutor at the college teaching Latin and Greek. He spent two years as a Christian minister in New Hampshire, and two in Boston as pastor of the Ruggles Street Baptist Church. Then, in 1848, he became President of the Michigan Central College, renamed Hillsdale College in 1853, and remained in this office until his resignation in 1869. In 1857, Fairfield received LL.D. degree from Madison University (now Colgate University) in New York. Politics and further academics Fairfield served as a Republican in the Michigan Senate (14th district) from 1857-1859. He was elected to serve as the 12th Lieutenant Governor of Michigan from 1859 to 1861, and made a widely published speech on the \\"Prohibition of Slavery in the Territories\\". In 1863, Fairfield received a Doctor of Divinity degree from the Indiana University Bloomington. The following year he received an S.T.D. degree from Denison University of Ohio. In the early 1870s, Dr. Fairfield was involved in public dispute based on a review he published in Mansfield, Ohio regarding the Henry Ward Beecher adultery scandal. The scandal broke in 1873, and in 1874, Fairfield published \\"Wickedness in High Places: A Review of the Beecher Case\\" Robert Raikes Raymond, brother of Vassar professor John Howard Raymond, published a scathing review to this pamphlet entitled: \\"The Case of the Rev. E.B. Fairfield, D.D., LL.D.: Being an Examination of his 'Review of the case of Henry Ward Beecher\\" together with his 'Reply' and a Rejoinder\\" He received a number of honors in the academic world before being elected Chancellor of the University of Nebraska in 1876. The Board of Regents dismissed him in 1882, after a disagreement over religion and its place in education. Fairfield became the pastor of the Manistee congregational church from September 1882 to April 1889. In 1886, he was the Moderator of the Congregationalists' \\"General Association of Michigan\\" meeting held in Flint In July 1889, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Fairfield to be the consul of the United States at Lyons in place of Lawson V. Moore. His son George D. Fairfield was vice-consul in Lyons at the same time. He returned from France in 1893 and lived in Grand Rapids, where he lived an intellectual life of writing and speaking until 1896. In 1896, he became a pastor again at his former church in Mansfield Ohio and then in 1900 he retired to Oberlin, where he died in November 1904. Retirement and death In the theological field, Fairfield, having been a Baptist early in his career and Congregationalist pastor later in life, became convinced that the doctrines of Baptists were without sufficient foundation for him to remain a minister in any Baptist denomination. He delineated his views in his Letters on Baptism (1893). He died on November 7, 1904 in Oberlin, Ohio at the age of eighty-three in Oberlin, eleven years after its publication. Family life fairfield was the son of Micajah Fairfield and Hannah (Wynn) Fairfield. He was married three times. He married his first wife, Lucia Ann Jennison, daughter of Dr. Charles Jennison and Betsy Mahan, on August 27, 1845. They had three children together. He married his second wife Mary A.

The first-generation Lacetti was available as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon, styled by Pininfarina—and five-door hatchback styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The sedan and wagon were marketed as the Suzuki Forenza in North America. The hatchback, was introduced in 2004 and marketed as Daewoo Lacetti5 in South Korea, Suzuki Reno in the United States, Daewoo Nubira in Europe, and elsewhere also as the Chevrolet Nubira and Lacetti. In November 2008, the second-generation Lacetti was launched as the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, a badge-engineered version of the Chevrolet Cruze, co-developed by GM Daewoo, Holden, and General Motors. It was marketed under the Daewoo marque until the beginning of 2011, when the brand was discontinued, and was thereafter marketed under the Chevrolet and Holden brands. The name Lacetti derives from the Latin \\"Lacertus\\", meaning \\"youthful\\".  First generation (J200; 2002–2009)  = Body styles and design = Lacetti was developed based on its predecessor Nubira under Daewoo before it was acquired by GM. The four-door sedan, designed by Pininfarina, was launched in South Korea on 25 November 2002, following a development period of two years and six months. A pre-production prototype of the five- door hatchback, styled by Giorgetto Giugiaro, was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2003 with production starting in December. The hatchback featured a different exterior and interior design than the sedan. At the Geneva Motor Show in March 2004, Daewoo revealed the station wagon body variant penned by Pininfarina with the hatchback's updated interior and a facelifted derivative of the sedan's frontal styling. The facelift replaced the three-slot grille with a single item for a new full-length item featuring a bold horizontal bar capped in the center by the company's logo. The wagon's door handles ditch the lift-up variety from the sedan and hatchback for pullout versions. A facelift for the sedan was released on 25 March incorporating these new door handles, front-end styling and interior changes. The hatchback also received new door handles around this time. The sedan was facelifted for some markets from 2007, receiving the same front end as the hatchback featured since its debut. This version was only produced in certain countries, such as Colombia, India or Thailand, and in 2013–2016 in Uzbekistan as the Daewoo Gentra.

The five-door hatchback showed off only after the 2004 facelift of the sedan, which mainly included a new front grill, switching from a three-part corporate Daewoo grill to a simpler, Chevrolet- style grill. The hatchback name was Lacetti5, offering a specific design for the front, rear and dashboard. The wagon version, called simply the Lacetti Wagon, was introduced in late 2007—though it was already sold in many other countries. It had the same dashboard as the hatchback, with the sedan front end. At the same time, GM Daewoo introduced the VM Motori diesel engines on the Lacetti range. When the Lacetti Premiere was introduced in November 2008, the sedan and wagon version sales were discontinued, leaving the only hatchback in the range, renamed Lacetti EX. The Lacetti EX was discontinued in October 2009.  Australia and New Zealand  In Australia and New Zealand the Daewoo Lacetti was briefly sold between September 2003 and December 2004 as a four-door sedan. At this time, Daewoo withdrew from the Australian market. Fitted with the 1.8-liter engine rated at and , the Lacetti offered standard five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic transmission. The single trim level, called SX, included are dual front airbags, air conditioning, power steering, keyless entry, power windows, CD player, and an alarm. The special edition SX Limited from October 2003 added anti-lock brakes, side impact airbags, alloy wheels, climate control air conditioning, six-stacker CD player, tilt/telescopic steering wheel, lumbar support for the front passenger seat, and leather trim. From 2005, the Lacetti (sedan and wagon) and Lacetti hatchback were sold together as the JF series Holden Viva. It was introduced at around the same time as the Daewoo Gentra-based Holden Barina. Unlike the Barina, however, the Viva was meant to be below the premium Holden Astra as a budget alternative. Despite the Viva's lower price compared to the Astra ( compared to ), the Astra continued to outsell the Viva by a factor of about two-to-one. With the release of the all new Holden Cruze in mid-2009 the Viva ceased to be sold in Australia. In New Zealand, where many cars are imported second-hand from Japan, several Japanese specification Chevrolet Optra sedans and wagons were also sold.

The sedan was available for model years 2004 and 2005, but was removed for 2006. All are powered by the 2.0-liter inline-four D-TEC engine, rated at at 5400 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm, driving the front wheels through either a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic. Despite its compact size and the 2.0-liter engine, fuel economy was poor rated at for city and highway driving, respectively, which was worse than mid-size cars like the Toyota Camry or Honda Accord, considering that the Optra was a compact car. The main selling point of the Optra was its low price at $12,000 MSRP. The car was positioned as a versatile and fun to drive but affordable budget compact family car. The Optra slotted between the Cobalt and the Aveo, and it replaced the Daewoo Nubira. Brakes are disc, front and rear. Independent suspension, 15-inch wheels, and CD player were standard on the LS sedan, with optional ABS and air conditioning; the LT adds standard air conditioning and cruise control, standard fog lamps on both LS and LT, and an optional sunroof. The sedan is rated as an Ultra Low Emissions Vehicle. The Optra5 hatchback was added to the line-up for 2004 and was more contemporary in styling and equipment, with projector type headlights and fog lamps, clear taillight lenses, and blackout grille. In addition to the same options available on the sedan LS and LT models, an options package contained alloy wheels, sunroof, spoiler, leather steering wheel and shift knob, and steering wheel mounted controls for the eight-speaker audio system. The Optra wagon was also added to the line-up for 2005, sharing the sedan’s front styling. The wagon has standard alloy roof rails, 60/40 folding rear seat, and a 12-volt power outlet in the rear compartment, in addition to the same options available on the sedan LS and LT models. General Motors Canada discontinued the importation of Optra for 2008.  China  In China, the cars are marketed as the Buick Excelle sedan or wagon and Excelle HRV (hatchback). The sedan, which is also assembled in China, features an updated exterior. The successor to the Daewoo Lacetti-based Buick Excelle is based on the global GM Delta II platform, like the Opel Astra and Chevrolet Cruze and their derivatives. The development center at the Opel plant in Rüsselsheim, Germany, leads the development of this platform. This second generation hatchback Buick Excelle XT, making its debut in 2009, is actually a replica of the Opel Astra hatchback adapted to Chinese conditions. The corresponding sedan (Excelle GT) made its debut in China in 2010. A version of this sedan for North America was introduced for model year 2012 as Buick Verano, and as Opel Astra sedan in other parts of the world. The Lacetti-based first generation (Excelle) sedan, however, continued to be produced for the Chinese market until 2016.  Europe  In Europe, the car was initially sold as the Daewoo Nubira, with the production model being introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2003. However, by the end of 2004, it was rebadged Chevrolet Lacetti throughout the continent. As with its home market, in some European markets, the Lacetti name is also used for the entire range of sedan, station wagon and hatchback models on the same J-series platform. In Finland and Germany, for example, only the hatchback is sold under the Lacetti name. The European models were initially only available with the following gasoline powered four-cylinder engines: * 1.4 L E-TEC II—93 hp (69 kW) at 6300 rpm * 1.6 L Family 1— at 5800 rpm, : 10.9 seconds (4-door) and 10.6 seconds (5-door), top speed: (4-door manual) and (5-door manual) * 1.8 L Family II— at 5800 rpm * 2.0 L D-TEC— at 5800 rpm * 2.0 L DOHC—, : 9 seconds, top speed: (4-door manual) A diesel-powered version was later added to the line-up with these specifications: * 2.0-liter SOHC turbo diesel engine, under VM Motori licence of RA 420 SOHC (see List of VM Motori engines), , torque from 2000 rpm, in 9 seconds, top speed. This engine is available with five-speed manual and five-speed automatic. In Europe, the sedan version was initially sold as the Daewoo Nubira. However, in late 2003, it was announced that Daewoo would be rebranded Chevrolet in some European markets. The Chevrolet Nubira went on sale in early 2004, initially only in Eastern Europe. When Daewoo was rebranded Chevrolet across Europe by the end of 2004, the Chevrolet Nubira was renamed Chevrolet Lacetti in some markets for the 2005 model year, which expanded the Lacetti line-up to include both the sedan and station wagon versions in addition to the five-door hatchback version, in line with Korea. The engines built for the Nubira and its badge-engineered twins are the same as in the Lacetti hatchback and its badge-engineered versions. The 1.8-liter Family II four-cylinder engine is sourced from the Australian car maker Holden.  India  Chevrolet Optra Magnum (India) In 2004, The Lacetti was launched in India and sold as the Optra and the sportsback version was sold as Optra S-RV (formerly known/sold as Chevrolet SRV), which the company planned to produce with a 2.0-liter diesel engine in the near future. The Optra was sold with two engine options, 1.6- and 1.8-liter. The 1.6-liter ecotec petrol version was available in three trim levels, the Elite, the Elite LS, and the high-end LT Royale, while the 1.8-liter petrol version was available in two levels, the LT and the LT AT (automatic transmission). The 1.6-liter petrol produced and allowed a top speed of , while the 1.8-liter petrol sibling was capable of producing and a limited top speed of . However, the 1.8-liter automatic was capable of . In 2007 GM India introduced a facelifted diesel-engined Optra called the Optra Magnum. The Magnum sported the family nose, and better interiors as compared to the petrol version, also a new 2.0-liter TCDi engine capable of producing . Subsequently the petrol version received the new nose treatment (as that of the Optra SRV, but with a slightly different front grill) and tail lights, and was sold as the Optra Magnum petrol. The S-RV succumbed to competition from cheaper cars and was eventually discontinued in 2009. It had a 1.6-liter petrol engine with a maximum power output of . The Optra sedan continued selling in India until 2013.  Pakistan  In Pakistan, the car came in three trim levels, 1.6-liter SE and LS and the 1.8-liter CDX. SE trim models came with manual transmission only, whilst LS and CDX models came with five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions. Sales however, were poorer than expected and all models were withdrawn from sale.  Japan  In Japan, Suzuki briefly distributed the Lacetti as the Chevrolet Optra wagon.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=minm9w4RjqY&app;=desktop&ab;_channel=n35a2 It was available in two trim levels, the LS and the LT. Both came with either a five-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission with a console shift. The Optra Wagon was powered by a 1.6 or 1.8-liter engine. For model years 2004 and 2005 the Lacetti sedan was also sold in Japan as the Chevrolet Optra LT. The Optra was limited in sales due to the exterior dimensions exceeding , thereby causing Japanese owners to pay a yearly tax for a vehicle that exceeds Japanese dimension regulations.  Mexico  In Mexico, the Lacetti came to the market in 2006 as Optra to replace the Chevrolet Astra, and it was sold only as a sedan. The Optra was phased out after the 2009 model year in favour of the Chevrolet Cruze, although for now, the Mexican Cruze is an imported model from South Korea.  Colombia  The Lacetti as a best seller was launched in Colombia, under the Chevrolet brand as Chevrolet Optra, in 2004 with the sedan version having the following engine options: * 1.4 L GM Family I engine E-TEC II, at 6300 rpm * 1.8 L GM Family II engine D-TEC, at 5800 rpm In 2006 the hatchback version was introduced, with only the aforementioned 1.8-liter engine. By 2006, the 1.4-liter engine was replaced by the 1.6 L Family I E-TEC II, at 5800 rpm. In addition, the design of wheels, and the grille were updated for all models offered. The Vehicle was sold in LT and LTZ trims. LS trim wasn't available in the Colombian market. In 2009, the saloon version received a facelift marketed as Chevrolet Optra Advance, with a sportier interior and front styling similar to that of the hatchback, it was sold with GM's 1.6 and 1.8 engines, with the 5 Speed Manual Transmission and 4 Speed Automatic Transmission. Assembly at the Bogotá GM plant (GM Colmotores) ceased in 2013 due to the modernization of GM Colmotores lineup.  Southeast Asia  In Singapore, the name \\"Chevrolet\\" has replaced the Daewoo nameplate after GM bought Daewoo. It still offers the same line-up as did GM Daewoo, naming the Optra sedan, Optra station wagon and Optra5 hatchback in Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. In Indonesia, the sedan is simply called Optra or Optra Magnum for the facelift model, and Estate for the station wagon. The vehicles use the 1.6- or 1.8-liter engine with an automatic transmission option for selected models.  United States  Suzuki marketed a rebadged Lacetti as the Forenza and Reno beginning in the United States in 2004—following the end of Daewoo's North American operations in 2002 and replacing the Daewoo Nubira station wagon and sedan. The Forenza/Reno falls between the Aerio (later SX4) and the now-discontinued Verona. In the territories of Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, it was sold as a Chevrolet Optra, but it was only available as a sedan. The US model line features the 2.0-liter four-cylinder D-TEC made by General Motors, developing a maximum power of at 5600 rpm. The Forenza and the Reno were discontinued within the 2008 model year, the Reno being replaced by the Suzuki SX4 sedan after the 2008 model year and the Forenza by the Chevrolet Cruze.  Iraq  The Chevrolet Optra entered the Iraqi market in 2004 with the 1.6-liter engine; a few years later the LS term version was used as a traffic police patrol vehicle.  Uzbekistan  In Uzbekistan, the Lacetti has been produced by GM Uzbekistan since 2008, in a plant located in Asaka, and marketed as the Chevrolet Lacetti. In 2013, the partner company Uz-Daewoo Avto began producing the facelifted sedan version as the new Daewoo Gentra. It is marketed throughout the CIS countries. In 2015 the car was renamed the \\"Ravon Gentra.\\"  Russia  Ravon Gentra It was sold as the Chevrolet Lacetti and includes 5-door hatchback, sedan and station wagon models. The entire line of models were produced at the Avtotor plant in Kaliningrad with full cycle of manufacturing until 2012. In 2014, UzDaewoo, GM's subdivision in Uzbekistan, started importing the Lacetti sedan as Daewoo Gentra. After license agreement between GM and Daewoo ended, UzDaewoo (now GM Uzbekistan) re-branded all of its lineup as Ravon, due to impossibility of using both Daewoo and Chevrolet names in Russia (Chevrolet withdrew from the Russian market in early 2015 due to the economic crisis). The Russian models are available with the following gasoline-powered four-cylinder engines: * 1.4 L: 95 hp; manual; not available for station wagon * 1.6 L: 110 hp; automatic and manual (wagon is manual only) * 1.8 L: 122 hp; automatic and manual (wagon is manual only)  Second generation (J300; 2008–2011)  Daewoo Lacetti Premiere Daewoo Lacetti Premiere The second-generation, built on the GM Delta II platform, is sold in most markets as the Chevrolet Cruze. In South Korea it was originally branded as the Daewoo Lacetti Premiere, until the Daewoo brand was replaced by Chevrolet in 2011. For the Chinese successor of the Lacetti-based Buick Excelle, see Buick Excelle XT and Buick Excelle GT, which are twins of Opel Astra hatchback and sedan respectively. Chinese versions also included the new SAIC-GM-Wuling joint venture called Baojun 630 manufactured in Liuzhou, Guangxi, China. It was launched at the 2011 Shanghai Auto Show, and went on sale in August 2011.  Motorsport  The car has been used in the FIA's World Touring Car Championship from 2005 until 2012, and in the British Touring Car Championship from 2008 until 2011.  Media  The Chevrolet Lacetti was chosen as the new \\"reasonably-priced car\\" for Top Gear's \\"Star in a Reasonably-Priced Car\\" segment for series 8 in 2006, replacing the Suzuki Liana, which had ceased production. In this segment of the show, celebrity guests set timed laps of the Top Gear test track driving the Lacetti. In the first episode of series 15 of Top Gear, broadcast on BBC2 on 27 June 2010, the Lacetti, that had been used for the power laps, was given a \\"Viking Burial\\" by presenter Richard Hammond. An industrial chimney was demolished, collapsing over and almost completely burying the car under rubble. Soon afterwards, the new reasonably priced car, a Kia Cee'd, was unveiled to viewers.

Part of the Lubbock Independent School District, the school is known for its academic program and for the fact that it has produced a number of talented musicians, vocalists, businessmen, and scientists over the years (including Buddy Holly and The Crickets, Natalie Maines, Ralna English, and Mac Davis). The school was founded in 1891. It was the first high school in Lubbock County. Lubbock High's colors are black and gold and its mascot is the Westerner. The school primarily serves students from the central and eastern parts of Lubbock, but the school's LEAP (Lubbock Exemplary Academic Program) magnet program serves students from all over the city.  History  The school was founded in 1891 as a one-room school (two additional rooms were added in 1898). The original announcement of the school's opening read: \\"Schooling for all who could reach it by pony, wagon, buggy or on foot.\\" The first (and only) teacher at this point was Miss Minnie Tubbs.History of the School and LISD. Retrieved May 2, 2006. In March 1909, a fire set by students destroyed the building. After this, the school relocated to a brick building with two stories and a basement at the location of the current City Hall in Lubbock. In 1922 a bond issue provided for a new high school. This school of 28 teachers was located between 13th and 14th streets in the 2000 block. Bonds were voted in 1925 for the addition of two study halls. This was the old Thompson Junior High building. In the fall of 1929, plans began for the construction of a new building for LHS. Construction began in 1930, and the building was completed in 1931. The school opened in its new location for the fall semester of 1931. This is the current Lubbock High School building. Due to its distinctive architecture, the school is included in the National Register of Historic Places.Lubbock High School. Retrieved May 2, 2006.  Academics  In 1979, due to low enrollment as a result of new school district boundaries, there was discussion of closing LHS. To solve this problem and to comply with an ongoing desegregation plan ordered by the US Department of Justice, LEAP (Lubbock Exemplary Academic Program) was developed. This college preparatory program offers advanced classes in mathematics, science, English, and history. Counselor Nancy Phillips was instrumental in the initial success of the LEAP Program. In its initial design, the LEAP plan included several incentives to attract students from outside the school's geographic district. These included unique classes not offered at that time in other Lubbock high schools, including Russian, Portuguese, Mandarin Chinese, Western Cultures, Marine Biology, and Calculus, among others. Additionally, the school offered trips to relevant locations in conjunction with specific classes. For example, students in the Western Cultures class spent 15 days in western Europe at the close of the school year. Due to pressure from parents with students in other high schools in the district, some of these incentives were phased out by the school board in the 1983–1984 academic year. 1983 saw the addition of the \\"Friday Enrichment Schedule,\\" wherein students attended academic classes Monday through Thursday (for longer hours than other high schools in Lubbock) and attended either \\"enriching classes\\" (e.g. \\"Reading for Pleasure,\\" \\"French Club,\\" etc.) or review classes from 8 am until noon on Fridays. The Friday Enrichment Schedule was altered to exclude the \\"enriching classes\\" in favor of shortened academic classes in 2007. The school now has an \\"abbreviated\\" Texas Friday schedule with classes ending at 1:35 on Fridays. Along with the \\"Friday Enrichment Schedule,\\" a program was instituted in 1983 that allowed junior or senior students to take courses at Texas Tech University or South Plains College for dual credit.

Pihos played college football, principally as an end and fullback, for Indiana University from 1942 to 1943 and 1945 to 1946. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1942, 1943, and 1945. His college playing career was interrupted by service in the United States Army during World War II. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1966, the first Indiana player to be so honored. Pihos played professional football as an end in the National Football League (NFL) for the Philadelphia Eagles from 1947 to 1955. While with the Eagles, he helped the team win back-to-back NFL championships in 1948 and 1949. He was selected six times to play in the Pro Bowl (1950–1955) and six times as a first-team All-Pro (1948, 1949, 1952–1955). During his career, he was one of the NFL's leading receivers. He was named to the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team in 1969 and inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1970. After his playing career was over, Pihos was the head football coach for National Agricultural College (later renamed Delaware Valley University) from 1956 to 1958. He also held coaching positions with Tulane University (assistant coach, 1959–1960) and the Richmond Rebels (head coach, 1964–1965). Early life Pihos was born in 1923 in Orlando, Florida. His parents, Louis and Mary Pihos, were Greek immigrants. In August 1937, when Pihos was 13 years old, his father, the operator of an all-night restaurant in Orlando, was murdered. His body was discovered behind the counter of the restaurant with his skull fractured in 12 places. Police concluded he had been struck with a meat cleaver or axe. A young truck driver was arrested and charged with the murder but was not convicted. Pihos attended Orlando High School where he played football as a tackle and basketball as a guard.The 1939 Jigando (Orlando High School yearbook), approximately page 76 and 79. Ancestry.com. U.S., School Yearbooks, 1880-2012 [database on-line]. When he was a junior in high school, his mother moved the family to Chicago, where he attended Austin High School. College and World War II =1942 and 1943 seasons= Pihos attended the Indiana University and played for the Indiana Hoosiers football team, first as an end in 1942 and 1943. As a sophomore in 1942, Pihos caught 17 passes for 295 yards. He scored the only touchdown in a 7–0 upset victory over the seventh-ranked Minnesota Golden Gophers, which came in the game's closing minutes and ended Minnesota's hope of a third straight Big Ten Conference title. He was named to the All-America team selected based on the votes of 1,706 fellow players, earned honorable mention on the United Press (UP) All-America team, and was a second-team selection on the UP's All-Big Ten team. As a junior in 1943, Pihos caught 20 passes for 265 yards and four touchdowns and scored two rushing touchdowns. He led the Hoosiers to a 34–0 victory over Wisconsin; after catching a touchdown pass from Bob Hoernschemeyer in the first half, head coach Bo McMillin moved him into the backfield for the second half where he scored two rushing touchdowns. He was named a first-team All-American by Sporting News, Collier's Weekly, and The New York Sun. He was also a unanimous selection by conference coaches as a first-team end on the 1943 All-Big Nine Conference football team. On January 1, 1944, Pihos and teammate Bob Hoernschemeyer played for the East team in the East–West Shrine Game, with Hoernschemeyer throwing a touchdown pass to Pihos in a 13–13 tie game. =World War II= Pihos was drafted into the United States Army in January 1944. He served in the 35th Infantry Division under George S. Patton. Commissioned as a second lieutenant on the battlefield, he was awarded the Bronze Star and Silver Star medals for bravery. He was granted a furlough to return to Indiana University in September 1945 while awaiting his final discharge. =1945 and 1946 seasons= When Pihos returned to Indiana after his military service, he played at the fullback position for the 1945 Indiana Hoosiers football team that compiled the only undefeated record (9–0–1) in Indiana football history, won the program's first Big Ten Conference championship, and finished the season ranked No. 4 in the final AP Poll. He had only two days of practice before his first game back, Indiana's second game of the season, against Northwestern. He scored Indiana's only touchdown in the game, when he caught a pass at the Northwestern five-yard line and dragged three defenders with him over the goal-line. He scored the first two touchdowns in Indiana's 26–0 win over Purdue in the final game of the year. Pihos finished the season having carried the ball 92 times for 410 yards and seven touchdowns. He earned first-team All-America honors from Yank, the Army Weekly magazine, and finished eighth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. As a senior, Pihos played three positions (fullback, halfback, and quarterback) and was named the most valuable player on the 1946 Indiana Hoosiers football team. In a show of versatility, and despite suffering from a throat infection and thigh injury during the 1946 season, he carried the ball 76 times for 262 rushing yards, completed seven of 12 passes for 84 passing yards, had ten catches for 213 receiving yards, and scored eight touchdowns. He ended his college career by scoring three touchdowns against the Purdue Boilermakers, helping the Hoosiers win the Old Oaken Bucket for that year. Pihos finished third in the voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football as the most valuable player in the Big Nine Conference. In four seasons at Indiana, Pihos scored 138 points, which was then the school's all-time scoring record. He also broke Indiana career records for touchdowns and receptions. Bo McMillin, Indiana's head football coach since 1934, called Pihos \\"the greatest all-around football player our team has known in my time at Indiana.\\" Professional football player Pihos was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the fifth round (41st overall pick) of the 1945 NFL Draft, but he continued to play for Indiana in 1945 and 1946. In February 1947, he signed to join the Eagles after his graduation in June. In his first NFL season, he caught 23 passes for 382 yards and seven touchdowns. He also blocked a punt by Sammy Baugh and returned it 26 yards for a touchdown against the Washington Redskins. The Eagles made it to the NFL Championship Game in each of Pihos' first three seasons with the team. In 1947, the team captured its first division championship. In the playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers for the Eastern Division title, Pihos blocked a punt to set up the first touchdown in the Eagles' 21–0 win. The Eagles then lost 28–21 to the Chicago Cardinals in the 1947 NFL Championship Game. Pihos caught three passes for 27 yards in that game and intercepted a pass while playing defense. The Eagles then won consecutive NFL championship games in 1948 and 1949. Pihos scored the only offensive touchdown of the 1949 championship game via a 31-yard reception in the second quarter during a heavy downpour. Pihos' 766 receiving yards and 11 receiving touchdowns in 1948 were both the second-most in the NFL that season. He earned first-team All-Pro recognition in 1948 from United Press (UP), New York Daily News, Chicago Herald-American, and Pro Football Illustrated and in 1949 from the International News Service, UP, Associated Press, and New York Daily News. He was invited to his first of six-straight Pro Bowls after the 1950 season. In 1951, Pihos led the Eagles in receptions and receiving yards and intercepted two passes as a defensive end. Pihos caught only 12 passes and scored only one touchdown in 1952, causing the Eagles front office to suspect he was washed up. However, he still managed to make the Pro Bowl and earn first-team All-Pro honors by the AP as a defensive end. Not willing take a pay cut and be an exclusive defensive end, he trained heavily during the off-season prior to 1953. He went on to have his greatest statistical success over the next three seasons, which were ultimately his final three; he recorded similar statistics over that three-year span (185 receptions, 2,785 yards, and 27 touchdowns) to his first six seasons (188 receptions, 2,834 yards, and 34 touchdowns). Pihos led the NFL in receptions in each of his final three seasons, in receiving yards twice, and in receiving touchdowns once. In 1953, he became the third different player to record a \\"triple crown\\" in receiving; he led the NFL in receptions (63), receiving yards (1,049), and receiving touchdowns (10) that season. In November 1955, Pihos announced that the current season would be his last as a player. In his final NFL game, on December 11 against the Chicago Bears, he caught 11 passes for 114 yards. He retired after playing in the Pro Bowl that January, in which he caught four passes and scored the East's first touchdown by out-leaping defender Jack Christiansen to snag a 12-yard pass from Eddie LeBaron. During his nine seasons of play with the Eagles, Pihos missed just one game. Coaching career =National Agricultural= In March 1956, shortly after retiring from the NFL, Pihos was hired as the head football coach at National Agricultural College (later renamed Delaware Valley University) in Doylestown, Pennsylvania. He had been an advisory coach for the college in 1955 and also taught classes in business law. He remained in the position for three years and led the 1958 National Aggies to a 5–2–1 record. His contract was not renewed after the 1958 season. =Tulane= In August 1959, Pihos was hired as an assistant coach under head coach Andy Pilney for the Tulane Green Wave football team. He was given responsibility for coaching the ends. He spent two years coaching at Tulane with the team compiling 3–6–1 records in both 1959 and 1960. In December 1960, Pihos resigned his position at Tulane. =Cincinnati= In February 1961, Pihos was hired by a group seeking to secure a professional football franchise for Cincinnati in the American Football League (AFL) for the 1962 season. He was the general manager of the enterprise and was also slated to be head coach of the proposed team. However, when the AFL announced its expansion plans for 1962, Cincinnati was not awarded a franchise. =Semipro and minor league football= In 1962 and 1963, Pihos served as the head coach of the Hammonton Bakers, a semipro football team in Hammonton, New Jersey. In 1964, Pihos served as the head coach of the Richmond Rebels of the Atlantic Coast Football League. He remained with the Rebels in 1965 as the team joined the Continental Football League. He led the Rebels to records of 8–5–1 in 1964 and 6–8 in 1965. He stepped down as the coach of the Rebels in February 1966. Honors Pihos received numerous honors for his accomplishments as a football player. His honors include the following: * In October 1961, he was named to the Helms Athletic Foundation's Major League Football Hall of Fame. * In February 1966, he was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. He was the first Indiana Hoosiers football player to receive the honor. In a halftime ceremony during the opening game of Indiana's 1966 season, the school presented Pihos with a special citation for his contribution to the university through football. * In August 1969, as part of the NFL's 50th anniversary, the Pro Football Hall of Fame selected all-decade teams for each of the league's first five decades. Pihos was selected as an end on the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team. * In February 1970, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At the induction ceremony in August 1970, a telegram was presented from Vice President Spiro Agnew calling Pihos \\"the golden Greek of football\\" and \\"the most durable and versatile football player\\" of his time. * In 1978, Pihos was inducted into the Indiana Football Hall of Fame. * In 1982, he was one of the inaugural inductees into the Indiana Hoosiers Hall of Fame. * In November 1987, he was one of the 11 inaugural inductees into the Philadelphia Eagles Honor Roll. Family and later years Pihos was married four times. In May 1944, he married Dorothea Lansing at the First Methodist Chapel in Bloomington, Indiana. Pihos was at that time a private in the Army stationed at Camp Reynolds. They met while both were students at Indiana University. She became a pediatrician. They were divorced in 1949. Pihos was next married in December 1949 to model Mary Cecile Clark, also known as Cecile Chandler. He and his second wife separated in 1965 and were divorced in 1967. He was married for a third time to Charlotte Berlings Wolfe in November 1967.Ancestry.com. Virginia, Marriage Records, 1936-2014 [database on-line].Certificate of Marriage between Peter Louis Pihos and Charlotte Berlings Wolfe. Certificate states that Pihos had previously been married twice. Ancestry.com. Virginia, Marriage Records, 1936-2014 [database on-line]. His fourth marriage was to Donna Ballenger. After retiring from football, Pihos had a business career. As of 1970, he was a vice president of Regal Home Improvement Co. in Richmond, Virginia. In 1977, he was living in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and was employed as a vice president of Franklin National Life Insurance Co. In 2001, Pihos was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 2004, he was victimized by a con artist who acquired Pihos' lifetime collection of sports memorabilia in exchange for $30,000 in bogus checks. He spent his last years at the Grace Healthcare nursing home in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He died there at age 87 in August 2011. His neurologist opined that Pihos' dementia was caused by blows to the head during his career as a football player. Pihos was buried at Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery in Winston-Salem. Pihos' daughter Melissa Pihos made a series of documentary films about her father. She began in 2010 with a documentary short titled Dear Dad juxtaposing photos and footage from his days as a football player with images of him as he fought the disease. She also created Pihos: A Moving Biography, exploring aspects of her father's life and his struggle with Alzheimer's disease through film and dance. Her efforts culminated in a feature-length documentary titled Pihos: A Life in Five Movements.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Deputy Under Secretary Dr. Janey Thornton is present for an event to launch International School Meals Day on 08 Mar 2013. The class is video conferencing to a school in Ayrshire, Scotland, with some of their children visible on the screens. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (79 P.L. 396, 60 Stat. 230) is a 1946 United States federal law that created the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to provide low-cost or free school lunch meals to qualified students through subsidies to schools.Copy of the School Lunch Act As Enacted in 1946, Federal Education Policy History website The program was established as a way to prop up food prices by absorbing farm surpluses, while at the same time providing food to school age children. It was named after Richard Russell, Jr., signed into law by President Harry S. Truman in 1946, and entered the federal government into schools dietary programs on June 4, 1946. The majority of the support provided to schools participating in the program comes in the form of a cash reimbursement for each meal served. Schools are also entitled to receive commodity foods and additional commodities as they are available from surplus agricultural stocks. The National School Lunch Program serves 30.5 million children each day at a cost of $8.7 billion for fiscal year 2007. Most participants are also eligible for food during the summer through the Summer Food Service Program.  Early programs  School feeding in the United States underwent the same evolution as in Europe, beginning with sporadic food services undertaken by private societies and associations interested in child welfare and education. The Children's Aid Society of New York initiated a program in 1853, serving meals to students attending the vocational school. =Philadelphia= In 1894, the Starr Center Association in Philadelphia began serving penny lunches in one school, later expanding the service to another. Soon a lunch committee was established within the Home and School League, and lunches were extended to include nine schools in the city. In 1909, Dr. Cheesman A. Herrick, who was principal of the William Penn High School for Girls was credited with accomplishing the transfer of responsibilities for operation and support of the lunch program from charitable organizations to the Philadelphia School Board. He requested that a system be established to assure that the lunches served would be based upon sound principles of nutrition and required that the program be under the direction of a home economics graduate. The Board granted his request on an experimental basis and on the condition that the program would be self-supporting. The experiment proved successful, and the following year lunch services were extended to the Southern Manual Training School and later to three additional units. In the spring of 1912, the School Board established a Department of High School Lunches and directed that the food services be inaugurated in all the high schools of the city. During all this time the Home and School League had continued operating the feeding program in the nine elementary schools, and continued to do so until May 1915, when it reported to the Board that the need for a lunch system had been clearly demonstrated and that it could not be successfully operated by an organization outside the school system. As a result, the School Board placed the operation of both high school and elementary lunch programs under the supervision of the Department of High School Lunches and authorized the extension of the program to other elementary schools.Emma Smedley, The School Lunch: Its Organization and Management in Philadelphia, Smedley, 1920. =Boston= In September 1908, the Women's Educational and Industrial Union in Boston began to supply hot lunches to high schools which were under the supervision of the Boston School Committee. A central kitchen system was used and lunches were transported to the participating schools. In January 1910, an experimental program for elementary schools took the form of a mid-morning lunch prepared by the class in Home Economics three days each week. On two days of each week sandwiches and milk were served. The children ate their meals at their desks, there being no lunchroom in the building. Before the end of the school year (1909–10) five additional schools were benefiting from the program, and a total of 2,000 pupils were being served each day, according to a report submitted by Ellen H. Richards in the \\"Journal of Home Economics\\" for December 1910.  Early supports  =Early federal aid= As the scope of the meal supply expanded, local governments and school district boards could not provide the funds necessary to carry the increasing load. Supplementary contributions by charitable organizations and individuals did not suffice. Aid from Federal sources became inevitable. The earliest Federal aid came from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and 1933 when it granted loans to several towns in southwestern Missouri to cover the cost of labor employed in preparing and serving school lunches. Such Federal assistance was expanded to other areas in 1933 and 1934 under the operations of the Civil Works Administration and the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, reaching into 39 States and covering the employment of 7,442 women. =Commodity Donation Program= The depression of the 1930s brought on widespread unemployment. Much of the production of the farm went begging for a market, surpluses of farm products continued to mount, prices of farm products declined to a point where farm income provided only a meager subsistence. Millions of school children were unable to pay for their school lunches, and with but limited family resources to provide meals at home, the danger of malnutrition among children became a national concern. Public Law 320 passed by the 74th Congress and approved August 24, 1936, made available to the Secretary of Agriculture an amount of money equal to 30 percent of the gross receipts from duties collected under the customs laws during each calendar year. Needy families and school lunch programs became constructive outlets for the commodities purchased by the USDA under the terms of such legislation. Many needy school children could not afford to pay for lunches and were sorely in need of supplementary foods from a nutritional standpoint. Thus they would be using foods at school which would not otherwise be purchased in the market place and farmers would be helped by obtaining an outlet for their products at a reasonable price. The purchase and distribution program was assigned in 1935 to the Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation which had been established in 1933 as the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation to distribute surplus pork, dairy products, and wheat to the needy. These funds came from customs duties and were specifically designated to encourage agricultural surplus consumption via exports and domestic donations. In March 1937, there were 3,839 schools receiving commodities for lunch programs serving 342,031 children daily. Two years later, the number of schools participating had grown to 14,075 and the number of children had risen to 892,259. From 1939 to 1942，the number of schools participating increased by 78,841, and the number of pupils participating increased by 5,272,540. In July 1943, in an attempt to salvage the deterioration of school lunches, Congress passed Public Law 129 to amend the Agricultural Act of 1935. This law re-established school lunch programs using $60 million to cover the purchase of food, but not labor. The next year, Congress appropriated another $50 million and allowed child-care centers to participate. Since the Act passed, Congress has modified several aspects of the policy. Congress amended the NSLP in 1962 to adjust fund distribution. They decided that the budget allocated to each state should be influenced by the state's need for further assistance. Rather than just factoring in the number of participants, Congress took into account the state poverty level compared to the national poverty level. Then, in 1968, Congress improved the NSLP food options to accommodate students with special dietary needs. Most recently, in 2012, First Lady Michelle Obama took on the issue of school lunches. Changes that she initiated primarily focused on more specific nutritional requirements. The changes include updated food group nutrition standards, such as vegetable subgroups, re-adjusted meat and grain serving sizes to reflect different school grade ranges, an implemented requirement for whole grains, and milk-fat restrictions. Lower calorie ranges and a 10-year progressive sodium reduction plan also started in 2012.  Nutrition, behavior, and learning  Nutrition standards for the National School Lunch Program and National School Breakfast program were updated in 2012. This update in nutritional standards was funded through a federal statute signed into law by President Barack Obama. The bill called the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 funds free lunch programs in public schools for the next five years. The new guidelines require students to choose either a serving of fruit or vegetables every meal. Also, the portions must now be larger. Along with larger portions of fruits and vegetables, the National School Lunch Program now enforces a variety of other nutritional requirements. Food products and ingredients used to prepare school meals must contain zero grams of added trans fat per serving (less than 0.5 grams per serving as defined by FDA). Furthermore, a meal can provide no more than 30 percent of calories from fat and less than 10 percent from saturated fat. In late 2009, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released School Meals: Building Blocks For Healthy Children. This report reviews and provides recommendations to update the nutrition standard and the meal requirements for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. School Meals also sets standards for menu planning that focus on food groups, calories, saturated fat, and sodium, and that incorporate Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the Dietary Reference Intakes. Nutrition plays a critical role in cognitive development and academic performance for children; undernourished children are more likely to be less energetic and less able to concentrate. The day-to-day observation of teachers and administrators of the relationship between inadequate nutrition and behavior and ability to learn is substantiated by scientific studies. Twenty Cape Town, South Africa, children were studied for 11 years, beginning in 1955.-The study was based on the hypothesis \\"that the ill effects of under-nutrition are determined by (1) its occurrence during the period of maximum growth and (2) the duration of under-nutrition relative to the total period of growth. . . Evidence is cumulative and impressive that severe under- nutrition during the first 2 years of life, when brain growth is most active, results in a permanent reduction of brain size and restricted intellectual development.\\" Undernutrition During Infancy, and Subsequent Brain Growth and Intellectual Development from Malnutrition, Learning and Behavior.

Food safety In December 2009, a report was released that showed that fast food restaurants were far more rigorous in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens in beef and chicken than the school lunch program. A 2018 study by USDA and University of Connecticut researchers compared data from mandatory safety inspections for ground beef for the NSLP and separate data from random USDA inspections. The study found that the beef destined for the NSLP had fewer levels of test failures than beef for the market generally, although a study author noted that \\"ground beef that fails the National School Lunch Program’s inspection can be sold to other vendors and eventually make its way onto consumers' plates.\\"National School Lunch Program aces ground beef safety review, Food Safety News (January 24, 2018). Between 2005 and 2014, there were no outbreaks of Salmonella and E. coli linked to beef provided to the NSLP, although there were dozens of such outbreaks in commercially sold ground beef over the same period. Participation rates In 1967–68, the national enrollment in public and private schools was approximately 50.7 million, according to a survey of School Food Services in March 1968. About 36.8 million children, or 73 percent, were enrolled in schools participating in the National School Lunch Program with an actual average participation in the program of 18.9 million children, or about 37 percent of the national enrollment. Reasons for non- participation in the program were numerous but, in low-income areas and large urban centers, low participation was particularly evident. Many of the school buildings in these areas, as well as the small schools in rural areas, were built many years before there were plans for operating a school lunch program, and the buildings did not lend themselves to remodeling for that purpose - neither were local funds available for it. Many of the elementary school buildings in urban centers were built with the idea that the children could and should go home for lunch (\\"neighborhood schools\\") and lunchroom facilities were not available. Many of these conditions hold true today. Some school authorities have held to the idea that a school lunch program must be self- supporting, and others have felt that the school has no responsibility in this area. In 1968, a group of women's civil rights and religious groups formed the Committee on School Lunch Participation to research and draw attention to the issue. Under their chair, Jean E. Fairfax, the group produced an influential report, Their Daily Bread. In this report a junior high school principal remarked, \\"We think [school lunch] is the responsibility of parents and child. We do not check them to see if a student eats. As a whole, we are doing it as a service rather than a need.\\" The net result is that the children in the neediest areas must go without an adequate noonday meal at school, or perhaps an inadequate evening meal at home, or none at all. Many high school students prefer to bring a bag lunch from home or eat snacks and beverages at a nearby stand or from a vending machine in the school. In some instances the portions served to high school students are not adjusted to meet their needs and they seek other sources of service where their tastes and appetites can be satisfied. The predominate reason, however, appears to be inadequate funding at federal, state and local levels, with the end result that the children who cannot afford to pay are the losers. Native Americans and children of color In December 2014, Indian Country Today reported that 68 percent of Native American and Alaska Native students \\"are eligible for free and reduced- price school lunches, compared with 28 percent of white students. USDA data indicate that 70 percent of children receiving free lunches through the NSLP are children of color, as are 50 percent of students receiving reduced-price lunches.\\" The article expressed concern regarding efforts to undercut nutrition standards, and notes that several Native American schools are working to improve the quality of school lunches by using produce from school gardens, or tribally grown buffalo meat. Current challenges =Caloric and nutritional needs= For some time, the measurement from which the NSLP based its cash-reimbursements and meal provisions largely came from caloric requirements. However, while this worked in a time where malnutrition plagued the nation's poverty, a continuing focus on caloric intake ignores the growing national obesity epidemic. Balancing nutrition and calories has always been a challenge for the NSLP and its participating schools. This struggle can undermine schools that wish to comply with the national standards while still advocating healthy lifestyles. Another problem that contributes to this challenge is that nutritious food is often considered less favorable than competitive food that is available to students. Given the choice, students will often prefer competitive foods that are not required to meet federal minimum nutrition standards. =Competitive foods= In the US, the term competitive foods refers to any food source that competes with a lunch program's offerings. Such competitive foods include fast food offerings, a la carte food lines, and vending machines. A study was done in the 2009-2010 school year across 47 states and 622 districts to examine how much of districts' competitive food and drink policy complied with Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA) recommendations. One of the major reasons for this study to be done is the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act which requires schools to establish a science-based nutrition standards for competitive foods called a wellness plan. These provisions for competitive food and drinks included limits on specific nutrients in the food, such as sodium and fats. Less than 5% of districts met or exceeded DGA requirements. Only about 4% of districts across the nation required fruits and vegetables to be sold within the competitive foods which in no way helps the fruit and vegetable intake of students that is already sub-par. =Food waste= In a study of the Boston Public Schools, \\"on average, students discarded roughly 19 percent of their entrées, 47 percent of their fruit, 25 percent of their milk, and 73 percent of their vegetables.\\" \\"It was estimated that $432,349.05 worth of food is wasted annually at lunch by students in Grades 6–8 in [Boston Public Schools].\\" Overall, this sum makes up 26.1 percent of these three schools' food budgets, excluding labor and supplies. If translated nationally, Cohen estimates that roughly $1,238,846,400 in food is wasted on an annual basis. One reason that students discard this amount of food has to do with à la carte lines and vending machines. In a 1998 study of 16 randomly selected schools in St. Paul, Minnesota, the authors discovered a negative correlation between à la carte lines, vending machine use, and fruit and vegetable consumption. On average, students from schools without an à la carte line consumed nearly an entire serving more of fruit and vegetables than did students with such programs. Furthermore, students from all schools exceeded the daily USDA recommended calories from saturated fat, and students from schools with à la carte lines exceeded the recommendations by 1 percent more, on average. Concerning snack vending machines, the authors determined that with each vending machine present, \\"students' mean intake of fruit servings decreased by 11 percent.\\" Beverage machines showed no significant impact. =Rising costs= A challenge for schools that take part in the NSLP is rising costs of producing lunch. According to the School Lunch and Breakfast Cost Study (SLBCS), one in four school districts reported costs for school lunches above the program reimbursement rate. The additional cost must then be supplemented by school district general funds, and this puts a strain on school district budgets. Additional costs also make it difficult to meet federally mandated nutrition requirements because using the best palatable foods for students becomes too expensive. According to the 2008 USDA report on the NSLP, \\"other sources of increasing costs include increases in health care costs for employees and, more recently, rising food costs.\\" For example, in 2008, some school systems in Alabama, California, and Texas raised meal prices to keep up with \\"steep increases in food costs.\\" The school districts raised prices for paying students, while keeping prices the same for students that qualified for reduced-price or free lunches. This method of cost adjustment leaves either the school district or paying students to bear the burden of the price increase. National School Lunch Week National School Lunch Week takes place on the second Sunday in October. On October 6, 2017, President Donald Trump proclaimed National School Lunch Week.

He is the son of John Eisenhower, grandson of the 34th president of the United States, Dwight Eisenhower, and a son-in-law of the 37th president of the United States, Richard Nixon. Early life Eisenhower (age 12) poses with sign at presidential retreat named after him, 1960. David Eisenhower was born on March 31, 1948, in West Point, Orange County, New York, to Barbara (Thompson) and John Eisenhower, the only son and eldest of four children. His father was a U.S. Army officer, and his grandfather was Dwight D. Eisenhower, future president of the United States of America, and former Supreme Allied Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces in Europe during World War II. His father would go on to be a brigadier general in the U.S. Army Reserve, United States Ambassador to Belgium (1969–1971), and a renowned military historian. His grandfather would become president of Columbia University (1948–1953), and later the 34th president of the United States (1953–1961). After assuming the presidency in 1953, President Eisenhower named the presidential mountain retreat, formerly Camp Shangri-La, Camp David, after his grandson.\\"Camp David\\" at Dwight D.

Education and career Eisenhower graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1966. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in history cum laude from Amherst College in 1970. After college, he served for three years as an officer in the United States Naval Reserve.TIME Magazine, February 9, 1970. During this time, he was an officer on the in the Mediterranean Sea. He then earned his J.D. degree cum laude from The George Washington University Law School in 1976. He was at least loosely identified with the Nixon administration, when he accepted a request to attend the funeral of Dan Mitrione in 1970, the operative whose activities in training Uruguayan police in torture techniques, when later publicized, caused profound controversy, although there has been no suggestion that Eisenhower had any knowledge of Mitrione's controversial activities. He is today a teaching adjunct and public policy fellow at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, author, and co-chair of the Foreign Policy Research Institute's History Institute for Teachers. From 2001–2003, he was editor of the journal Orbis published by FPRI. Eisenhower was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1987 for his work Eisenhower At War, 1943-1945—about the Allied leadership during World War II. He is the host of a Public Television series called The Whole Truth with David Eisenhower, distributed by American Public Television. Personal life Julie and David Eisenhower (age 23) in 1971 On December 22, 1968, Eisenhower married Julie Nixon, a daughter of then President-elect Nixon, who served as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president. The couple had known each other since meeting at the 1956 Republican National Convention. The Reverend Norman Vincent Peale officiated in the non-denominational rite at the Marble Collegiate Church in New York City. Eisenhower's best man was future The Love Boat actor and U.S. congressman Fred Grandy. David Eisenhower was Julie Nixon's civilian escort when she was presented as a debutante to high society at the prestigious International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City in 1966. Many other members of the Eisenhower and Nixon families have been presented as debutantes at the International Debutante Ball, including their daughter Jennie. Eisenhower and his wife Julie live in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. They have three children: actress Jennie Elizabeth Eisenhower (b. 1978); Melanie Catherine Eisenhower (b. 1984); and Alexander Richard Eisenhower (b. 1980). They also have three grandchildren.

It is known by the street names Eden and Methyl-J. MBDB is a closely related chemical analogue of MDMA, with the only difference between the two molecules being an ethyl group instead of a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon. It has IC50 values of 784 nM against 5-HT, 7825 nM against dopamine, and 1233 nM against norepinephrine. Its metabolism has been described in scientific literature. MBDB was first synthesized by pharmacologist and medicinal chemist David E. Nichols and later tested by Alexander Shulgin and described in his book, PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. MBDB's dosage, according to PiHKAL, is 180–210 mg; the proper dosage relative to body mass seems unknown. Its duration is 4–6 hours, with noticeable after- effects lasting for 1–3 hours. MBDB was initially developed as a non- psychedelic entactogen. It has lower effects on the dopamine system in comparison to other entactogens such as MDMA. MBDB causes many mild, MDMA-like effects, in particular the lowering of social barriers and inhibitions, pronounced sense of empathy and compassion, mood lift, and mild euphoria, all of which are present. MBDB tends to produce less euphoria, psychedelia, and stimulation in comparison to MDMA. Legal Status Unlike MDMA, MBDB is not internationally scheduled under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The thirty-second meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (September 2000) evaluated MBDB and recommended against scheduling. From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of MBDB: :Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended. =Australia= MBDB is considered a Schedule 9 Prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. =Russia= MBDB is included into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. =Sweden= Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified MBDB as \\"health hazard\\" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Feb 25, 1999, in their regulation SFS 1999:58 listed as \\"2-metylamino-1-(3,4-metylendioxifenyl)-butan (MBDB)\\", making it illegal to sell or possess.

He is Lucie's father, a brilliant physician, and spent eighteen years \\"in secret\\" as a prisoner in the Bastille prior to the French Revolution. He is imprisoned because in the course of his medical practice he learns of abusive actions by two members of the aristocratic Evrémonde family. While realizing the power at court of nobles such as the Evrémondes, Manette reports them to a minister of the royal government. He is seized from his young family and imprisoned under a lettre de cachet. Character and plot At the start of the novel, Manette has been recently released from the Bastille after a long imprisonment. He is briefly given shelter in Paris by his former servant Ernest Defarge (who will subsequently be a leader of the storming of the Bastille) and is then reunited with his daughter Lucie. He does nothing but make shoes, a pastime that he adopted to distract himself from the tortures of prison. He is clearly not in his mind during this time; he speaks only when necessary, and has become so used to being a prisoner that he can hardly bear light or freedom. As he overcomes his past as a prisoner, due to his daughter's love and devotion to him, however, he resumes his occupation as a physician in England, and proves to be a kind, loving father who prizes his daughter’s happiness above all things. He even blesses her marriage to Charles Darnay; the son of the aristocrat who was responsible for his imprisonment (Darnay has completely renounced his family's ill-gotten fortune and is a good fellow, unaware of the harm that his father once inflicted on his current father-in-law). When Charles Darnay is arrested in France during the French Revolution, Manette is his witness that he is innocent. Unfortunately, Darnay is arrested again, due to a diary that Manette wrote when he was in jail, which sends Darnay back to prison. Darnay is condemned for his uncle's sins, but Sydney Carton (out of love for Lucie Manette), disguises himself as Charles and takes his place in the guillotine and dies for him. Analysis Dickens uses Doctor Manette in his novel, A Tale of Two Cities, to illustrate one of the dominant motifs of the novel: the essential mystery that surrounds every human being. As Jarvis Lorry makes his way toward France to recover Manette, the narrator reflects that \\"every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other.\\" For much of the novel, the cause of Manette’s incarceration remains a mystery both to the other characters and to the reader. Even when the story concerning the evil Marquis St. Evrémonde comes to light, the conditions of Manette's imprisonment remain hidden. Though the reader never learns exactly how Manette suffered, his relapses into trembling sessions of shoemaking evidence the depth of his misery. Like Carton, Manette over the course of the novel undergoes drastic change. He is transformed from an insensate prisoner who mindlessly cobbles shoes into a man of distinction. The contemporary reader tends to understand human individuals not as fixed entities but rather as impressionable and reactive beings, affected and influenced by their surroundings and by the people with whom they interact. In Dickens' age, however, this notion was rather revolutionary. Manette’s transformation testifies to the tremendous impact of relationships and experience on life. The strength that he displays while dedicating himself to rescuing Darnay seems to confirm the lesson that Carton learns by the end of the novel — that not only does one's treatment of others play an important role in others' personal development, but also that the very worth of one's life is determined by its impact on the lives of others. His daughter \\"recalls him to life\\" after he is rescued from his cell in the Bastille. At the end of the first book of Tale of Two Cities he is asked: \\"'I hope you care to be recalled to life?' And the old man answers: 'I can't say.'\\" Through the novel, Dr. Manette is a proven good soul, respected by the revolutionaries as well as his family. However his memories of his time in unjust imprisonment has had a negative effect on him. His obsessively making of shoes is only a distraction from the feelings he does not want to deal with. The shoes could be a symbol of freedom. Cinematic and theatrical portrayals * In the 1935 film A Tale of Two Cities, Dr. Manette is played by Henry B.

She was a daughter of Fahd bin Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and a granddaughter of Prince Muhammad bin Abdulaziz, who was an older brother of King Khalid (the then-Saudi king) and a son of King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Background Her family sent Princess Mishaal bint Fahd, at her own request, to Beirut, Lebanon, to attend school. While there, she fell in love with a man, Khaled al Sha'er Mulhallal, the nephew of Ali Hassan al Shaer, the Saudi ambassador in Lebanon, and they began an affair. Upon their return to Saudi Arabia, it emerged that they had conspired to meet alone on several occasions and a charge of adultery was brought against them. She attempted to fake her own drowning and was caught trying to escape from Saudi Arabia with Khaled. Although the Princess was disguised as a man, she was recognized by a passport examiner at Jeddah airport. She was subsequently returned to her family. Under the Wahhabi Sharia law current in Saudi Arabia, a person can only be convicted of adultery by the testimony of four adult male witnesses to the act of sexual penetration, or by their own admission of guilt, stating four times in court \\"I have committed adultery.\\" (Other Schools of Islamic Jurisprudence or Sharia have different views and legal practice than this.) Her family urged her not to confess, but instead to merely promise never to see her lover again. On her return to the courtroom, she repeated her confession: \\"I have committed adultery. I have committed adultery. I have committed adultery.\\" Execution On 15 July 1977, both were publicly executed in Jeddah by the side of the Queen's Building in the park. She was blindfolded, made to kneel, and executed on the explicit instructions of her grandfather, a senior member of the royal family, for the dishonor she brought on her clan. Khaled, after being forced to watch her execution, was beheaded with a sword by, it is believed, one of the princess' male relatives rather than by a professional executioner. Severing his head took five blows. Both executions were conducted near the palace in Jeddah, not in Deera Square. Controversy Independent film producer Antony Thomas came to Saudi Arabia and interviewed numerous people about the princess's story. He was met by conflicting stories, which later became the subject matter of a British documentary, Death of a Princess. The movie was scheduled to show on 9 April 1980 on the ITV television network and then a month later on the public television network PBS in the United States. Both broadcasts were met with livid protests followed by strong diplomatic, economic and political pressure from the Saudis to cancel these broadcasts. After having failed to get the British broadcast cancelled, King Khalid expelled the British ambassador from Saudi Arabia. In May 1980, attention then shifted to PBS, where their officials endured a month of mounting pressure from corporations and politicians. A major PBS sponsor, the Mobil Oil Corporation, took out a full- page ad in The New York Times op-ed page opposing the film and declaring it jeopardized U.S.-Saudi relations. After some stalling, it was eventually broadcast by the PBS program World in most of the US on 12 May 1980, although some PBS stations did not do so. For example, in South Carolina, the PBS affiliate cancelled broadcast of the film, a decision influenced by fact that the then US Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, John C. West, had formerly been the state's Governor. The docudrama was aired in the United States as part of a weekly PBS program called \\"World\\". That program later became known as PBS Frontline. Death Of A Princess aired again on Frontline in 2005, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the original broadcast.South Carolina public TV cancels 'Death of Princess', Wilmington Morning Star, 4 May 1980 King Khalid, Saudi Arabia's King at the time, was said to have offered $11 million to the network to suppress the film.

The square is named after the Constitution that Otto, the first King of Greece, was obliged to grant after a popular and military uprising on 3 September 1843.DOMESTIC POLICY 1833-1897 It is located in front of the 19th century Old Royal Palace, housing the Greek Parliament since 1934. Syntagma Square is the most important square of modern Athens from both a historical and social point of view, at the heart of commercial activity and Greek politics. The name Syntagma () alone also refers to the neighbourhood surrounding the square. Description View of the hotels to the north side of the Square, along King George I Street Syntagma Square as seen from Amalias Avenue in 2015 The square is bordered by Amalia Avenue (Leofóros Amalías) to the east, Otto Street (Óthonos) to the south and King George I Street (Vasiléos Georgíou Prótou) to the north. The street bordering the square to the west, connecting Stadiou Street with Fillelinon Street, is simply named \\"Syntagma Square\\" (Plateia Syntágmatos). The eastern side of the square is higher than the western, and dominated by a set of marble steps leading to Amalias Avenue; beneath these lies the Syntagma metro station. The stairs emerge below between a pair of outdoor cafes, and are a popular city-centre gathering place. Syntagma also includes two green areas to the north and south, planted with shade trees, while in the centre of the square there is a large mid-19th century water fountain. The Old Royal Palace neoclassical building, housing the Greek Parliament since 1934, is immediately across Amalias Avenue to the east, and surrounded by the extensive National Gardens, which are open to the public; the Parliament itself is not open to the public, even when not in session. Every hour, the changing of the guard ceremony, performed by the Presidential Guard, is conducted in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on the area between the Syntagma Square and Parliament building. On certain days, a ceremonial changing of the guard occurs with an army band and the majority of the 120 Evzones present at 11 am.  History  Dimitrios Kallergis on horseback demanding Constitution, Otto and Amalia at the windows of the Royal Palace. The square was designed and constructed in the early 19th century, shortly after King Otto moved the capital of the newly-born Greek Kingdom from Nafplio to Athens in 1834. It was designed as one of the two central squares of modern Athens, situated to what were then the eastern boundaries of the city. The second square was Omonoia Square, to the north of the city. Even though King Otto's Royal Palace was at first planned to be erected on Omonia Square, a location overlooking the eastern square was deemed a better option. Thus, the square's first name was \\"Palace Square\\". Work for the construction of the Old Palace to the north of the square, started in 1836 and lasted until 1843. About a month after the installation of King Otto and his wife Amalia in late July 1843, a popular and military uprising took place in the Greek Capital on September 3, 1843. Soldiers under Dimitrios Kallergis gathered in front of the palace and demanded the granting of constitution. King Otto was then obliged to grant the first Constitution of Greece. In memory of the event, the palace square was renamed to Constitution Square or Syntagma Square in Greek. Between 2010 and 2012, the square was the site of mass protests, including an occupation of the square with tents and other provisions due to the worsening economic situation during the Greek government debt crisis. Some of the demonstrations amassed crowds of up to 10,000 people, according to police reports, or 50,000 according to other sources. Since the inception of the \\"Unity Government\\", the occupation has been removed from the square and demonstrations are less frequent. Transport Syntagma Square is a hub for many forms of public transportation in Athens. Metro lines 2 and 3 of the Athens Metro have a stop at the Syntagma station, which is to be found under the square; the Athens Tram also stops here (currently closed, from October 19th 2018 until the end of repair works). Buses and trolleybuses are available to many places in the city. Travel between Syntagma Square and the Eleftherios Venizelos Airport is available via special airport bus and metro lines. Free high-speed wireless Internet access (4 Mbit/s) is offered by the Municipality of Athens at the Square. The square is also a hub for buses to the northern suburbs and the Athens Olympic Complex in Maroussi.

He played for the San Francisco 49ers from 1948 to 1960, the Baltimore Colts from 1961 to 1962, and returned to the 49ers in 1963 for his final year in football. He was exceptionally fast, a trait uncommon for a fullback and one which earned him the nickname, \\"the Jet\\". The first African-American to be named the NFL Most Valuable Player, he became one of American football's first black stars. After playing a season of football for Compton Junior College, Perry joined the U.S. Navy. While playing football in the military, he was spotted by the 49ers, who signed him into the AAFC. He spent the next 13 seasons playing for San Francisco, where he was featured in the \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\", made three straight Pro Bowl appearances, and in 1954 was named the NFL MVP by United Press International (UPI). He was the first player in the NFL to rush for 1,000 yards in consecutive seasons, doing so in 1953 and 1954. Perry retired in 1963 as the league's all-time leader in rushing yards, and in 1969 he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His jersey number 34 was retired by the 49ers in 1971. Early life Fletcher Joseph Perry was born in Stephens, Arkansas, and grew up in Los Angeles, California, after his family moved there during the Great Depression. He was a four-sport star at David Starr Jordan High School in Los Angeles. Perry grew up admiring several African-American athletes at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), including Jackie Robinson, who played football and baseball and ran track for the university. After being rejected by UCLA, Perry played football at Compton Junior College in 1944, and scored 22 touchdowns that season. He was then recruited by UCLA, but declined, and enlisted in the Navy during World War II. He played football in the military for Naval Air Station Alameda. In an East vs. West college all-star game in January 1948, Perry scored on a four-yard run in the first quarter for the West, which also featured Bobby Layne of Texas and Jake Leicht of Oregon. Professional career Standing tall and weighing , Perry was small for a typical fullback, even during his era. Also unlike typical fullbacks, Perry's forte was not to run with power, as he was a straight-ahead runner who combined power and speed with deceptive elusiveness. His role was primarily as a ball carrier rather than a blocker, and he had a knack for finding holes in opposing defensive lines. \\"If you saw a hole, you take it,\\" Perry described his running style to The Sacramento Bee. \\"If you didn't, you kept moving until you did. You run with instinct.\\" Perry was known for his speed, which earned him the nickname \\"The Jet\\". He ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds in 1947, two-tenths of a second slower than Mel Patton's then-world record of 9.3 seconds. =San Francisco 49ers= 1948–1952: AAFC and first Pro Bowl While playing for Alameda, Perry was scouted by the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, who offered him a $9,500 salary. He turned down the offer and instead signed with the San Francisco 49ers of the AAFC for $4,500. His decision was based on his trust in 49ers owner Tony Morabito, who Perry described as like a father. He was the team's first African-American player. It was during his first practices with the 49ers that he earned his nickname, when quarterback Frankie Albert exclaimed, \\"You're like a jet, Joe,\\" after Perry had shot out of his stance so quickly that Albert could not hand him the ball in time. Albert's successor at quarterback, Y. A. Tittle, echoed his sentiments. \\"He was the fastest player off the ball in the history of the world,\\" Tittle told the San Francisco Chronicle. \\"You'd take the ball from center and turn, and he was already gone through the hole.\\" Tittle became one of Perry's closest friends. Black players were a novelty in pro football when Perry entered the league, and he was faced with racial abuse and discrimination on and off the field. \\"I can't remember a season when I didn't hear a racial slur,\\" he said. \\"Someone would say, 'Nigger, don't come through here again', and I'd say, 'I'm coming through again, and you better bring your family.'\\" When he was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game in Houston, he and other black players on the all-star team were not allowed to stay in the same hotel as white players. There was initial uncertainty over whether or not black players would be allowed to participate in the game at all. Perry's 49ers teammates, however, were more accepting of him, and provided him strong support from the outset. With the 49ers in the AAFC, Perry led the league in rushing touchdowns in both 1948 in 1949, and also in rushing yards in 1949. He had the first and only kick return touchdown of his career in 1948 when he returned a kickoff 87 yards against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Following the season, Perry was invited to play in the 1949 AAFC All-Star game against the league champion Cleveland Browns. The AAFC folded soon after and the 49ers were absorbed into the NFL in 1950. Perry finished fifth among league rushing leaders in both 1950 and 1951. The 49ers acquired halfback Hugh McElhenny in the 1952 Draft, who joined Perry in the backfield to form a prolific rushing duo. He and McElhenny finished third and fourth in the league respectively in rushing yards that season. Following the season, Perry was invited to play in his first Pro Bowl. 1953 and 1954: Back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons Perry became the first player to eclipse 1,000 rushing yards in consecutive seasons, when he did so in 1953 and 1954. His 1,018 yards rushing in 1953 and 1,049 in 1954 were the third and second highest totals for a single season in the NFL, respectively, behind only Steve Van Buren's 1,146 yards in 1949. He led the league in carries, rushing yards, rushing yards per game, and yards from scrimmage in both seasons. His ten rushing touchdowns and 13 total touchdowns in 1953 were both the most in the NFL that year. Perry, McElhenny, and Tittle comprised the offensive backfield of that year's Pro Bowl. The Associated Press (AP), United Press (UP), and New York Daily News each named Perry their first-team All-Pro fullback. Morabito awarded Perry an extra five dollars for every yard he gained in 1953, for a total bonus of $5,090. With the 49ers' acquisition of halfback John Henry Johnson in 1954, Perry now had a reliable blocker to run behind. The backfield of Perry, Johnson, Tittle, and McElhenny—which became known as the \\"Million Dollar Backfield\\"—shattered the 49ers team record for rushing yards in a season. Despite having to split more carries between him and his teammates, Perry again led the NFL in rushing yards. He gained almost 400 yards more than his nearest competitor, his backfield mate Johnson. A. S. \\"Doc\\" Young, writing for Jet magazine, called Perry \\"the bellwether of the greatest rushing backfield in pro football.\\" The United Press named Perry its Pro Player of the Year, the first black player so honored. He was a first-team All-Pro for the AP, UP, New York Daily News, and The Sporting News, and played in his third straight Pro Bowl. Perry in 1963 1955–1960: All-time rushing leader Prior to a game against the Cleveland Browns at Kezar Stadium in 1955, the 49ers staged \\"Joe Perry Day\\", in which fans honored Perry with gifts including a new car. \\"I was a favorite son,\\" he said of the occasion. \\"I just thought Joe Perry Day was one of the great honors in my life.\\" He had 20 carries in that game for 116 yards, out-gaining the entire Browns backfield and prompting Cleveland coach Paul Brown to remark, \\"This was Joe Perry's day in more ways than one.\\" Perry accounted for 701 rushing yards and two touchdowns in 1955, leading the 49ers in rushing for the seventh straight season. His streak was snapped by McElhenny in 1956. The closest Perry came to winning a championship with the 49ers was in 1957, as San Francisco finished with an 8–4 record but lost the Western Conference tiebreaker game to the Detroit Lions. He led the 49ers in rushing for the final time in 1958, with 758 yards. That season, he surpassed Steve Van Buren for first place on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list. He was named a first-team All-Pro by The Sporting News. The following year, he shared carries with fullback J.D. Smith. Perry carried only 36 times for 95 yards in 1960 as Smith took over the starting role. After the season, Perry was traded to the Baltimore Colts. =Baltimore Colts, return to San Francisco, and retirement= Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank cited injuries to fullback Alan Ameche as the key reason for the team's inability to win a third straight NFL championship. Ewbank hoped Perry could fill in the role if Ameche was not ready when the season began. Ameche retired prior to the season, and Perry filled in to lead the Colts in rushing in 1961, while catching a career- high 34 passes for 322 yards. \\"Joe was the kind of guy you'd love to play your whole career with,\\" said Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. \\"He was older when we got him, but he did well for us. He was amazing on the screen pass, like McElhenny. And Joe clawed and scratched for every yard.\\" A thigh ligament injury caused him to miss several games in 1962 which, along with an injury to halfback Lenny Moore, severely hampered the Colts' running game. He was traded back to San Francisco in 1963, where he played a diminished role in his final nine games before retiring at age 36. Legacy and honors Perry's durability allowed him to play in three separate decades, from the 1940s to the 1960s, for 16 seasons. He was the NFL's career rushing leader from 1958 to 1963, ultimately compiling 8,378 yards; his record was broken by Jim Brown on October 20, 1963. His 7,344 rushing yards for the 49ers stood as the franchise record for nearly 60 years before it was broken in 2011 by Frank Gore. As of 2016, Perry's 68 rushing touchdowns with the team remains a franchise record. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1969, his first year of eligibility. Also in that year's class was longtime teammate, tackle Leo Nomellini. The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Hall. Perry's jersey number 34 was retired by the 49ers in 1971, and he was a charter member of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Following his death in 2011, the team honored Perry that season by wearing helmet decals with his number 34 on them. Other ventures and later life In addition to his football career, Perry also hosted a popular sports and music radio program, \\"Both Sides Of The Record\\", sponsored by Burgermeister Beer (\\"Burgie\\"), on R&B-formatted; KWBR (1310 AM; later known as KDIA) beginning in 1954. The program was arranged by Franklin Mieuli, a sports entrepreneur who worked in marketing for Burgie, in addition to being a part-owner of the 49ers and producer of the team's radio and television broadcasts. After retiring from football, Perry competed in the Professional Bowlers Association Tour and carried an average of over 200. He also served as a scout and assistant for the 49ers, and later was a sales representative for E & J Gallo Winery. The 49ers announced that Perry died on Monday April 25, 2011 in Arizona of complications from dementia at the age of 84. 49ers owner John York said: > I was deeply saddened to hear of Joe Perry's passing. He was a dear friend > to my family and I and to the entire 49ers organization. He was also an > integral part of our rich history. A truly remarkable man both on and off > the field, Joe had a lasting impact on the game of football and was an > inspirational man to the generations of players that followed him. Our > heartfelt sympathy goes out to his wife, Donna, and his entire family. He > will be sadly missed by all of us. On June 9, 2011, it was announced that Perry and his fellow Million Dollar Backfield teammate, John Henry Johnson, who died on June 3, 2011, would have their brains examined by researchers at Boston University who are studying head injuries in sports. Both men were suspected of suffering form chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disorder linked to repeated brain trauma.

The practitioner grips the wrapped middle of the lengthened crescent with the other acting as a hand guard. They are relatively short weapons that are easily concealable in traditional Chinese clothing, and are usually trained in pairs, one for each hand. Deer horn knives are especially associated with the soft style Chinese martial art Baguazhang, which is known for its diverse weaponry. They are mainly used in trapping an opponent's weapon in aid of tying up or breaking the opponent's weapon, disarming the opponent and other close combat applications.Yang, Jwing-Ming; Baguazhang: Theory and applications, YMAA Publication Centre, 2008, Deer horn knives are normally used against longer weapons such as spears, swords, broadswords, or any weapon which uses a safe distance to attack from. One advantage of deer horn knives in comparison to a longer weapon is that seeing as the deer horn knives are direct appendages of the hands, they can be moved with great speed and precision, and along with their ease of concealment, can easily be used to catch their opponent off guard.

Johnson. The Act was created as a result of the \\"years of cumulative successful experience under the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) to help meet the nutritional needs of children.\\" The National School Lunch Program feeds 30.5 million children per day (as of 2007). NSLP was operated in over 101,000 public and nonprofit private schools in 2007.Amber Waves , September 2008, USDA Economic Research Service The Special Milk Program, functioning since 1954, was extended to June 30, 1970 and incorporated into the act. The act also provided Federal funding assistance towards non-food purchases for school equipment. The act established the School Breakfast Program, a federally assisted meal program that provides low-cost or free breakfasts to children in public and non-profit schools as well as child care institutions. During the signing of the act, the president remarked that \\"good food is essential to good learning.\\" Importance It is important for food programs such as these in schools because some students may receive all their meals from school. According to the CDC, a poor diet can lead to energy imbalance (e.g., eating more calories than one expends through physical activity) and can increase one’s risk for overweight and obesity. Without a well balanced diet it could cause a child's brain to not develop normally (Berger, 172). Children may be malnourished and could possibly suffer from Protein-calorie malnutrition (Berger 172). In the long run if children do suffer from lack of nutrients it will not only impede brain growth but effect their ability to learn as well (Berger, 172). Some students have recognized the importance of a well balanced diet and started programs on a local level. Programs like the School Food Plus Initiative & E.A.T.W.I.S.E (Cooper, 54). Parents are also getting in on the action and have formed school district wellness committees around the country. They are looking forward to developing wellness policies that will charge local school districts with setting targets for nutrition education (Cooper, 84). Nutrition standards The National School Breakfast Program feeds 10 million children each day, and the National School Lunch Program feeds more than 30 million students. However, the national standards and meal requirements for these meals were created more than a decade ago. The planning model used to develop current nutritional standards and related meal requirements is based on legislation (USDA,1995)that provided specifications for use of 1995 Dietary Guidelines for American and the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (Stallings, 89). This model considers needs of the entire population of school children rather than specific individuals (Stallings, 91). The William F. Goodling Child Nutrition Reauthorization Act of 1998 () extended expiring authorizations for child nutrition and Commodity Assistance Programs, and the WIC program, through fiscal year 2003. Among other things, this law significantly expanded the availability of federal subsidies (through the school lunch program and the CACFP) for snacks served in after-school programs and authorized demonstration projects providing free breakfasts for elementary school children without regard to family income. Modest revisions were made to child nutrition and WIC program rules. The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (, ) required that all school districts with a federally funded school meal program develop wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.Pangrazi, Robert (2007) \\"Dynamic Physical Education for Elementary School Children\\", 15th ed. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Snack Program (Food and Nutrition Service) was also designed to increase fruit and vegetables available to schools. In 2008, a farm bill called for gradual expansion of program to all states by 2012. In the fall of 2009 the Institute of Medicine recommended updates and revisions to the school lunch and breakfast programs, at the request of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The committee reviewed the current regulations for the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program Nutrition Standards and Meal Requirements. The planning model used to develop current nutritional standards and related meal requirements is based on legislation (USDA,1995) that provided specifications for use of 1995 Dietary Guidelines for American and the 1989 Recommended Dietary Allowances (NRC, 1989). To meet its task, the IOM committee also reviewed and assessed the food and nutritional needs of school- aged children in the United States using the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans set by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and USDA, as well as the IOM’s Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). The committee recommends numerous revisions and that emphasis be placed on revised Meal Requirements rather than on nutrients per se. The committee’s recommended new approach clearly focuses on providing meals that are consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The final report, School Meals: Building Blocks for Healthy Children was released in November 2009. The committee recommended that the USDA adopt standards for menu planning, including: * Increasing the amount and variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains * Setting a minimum and maximum level of calories * Focusing more on reducing saturated fat and sodium On January 13, 2011, the USDA published new proposed regulations in the Federal Register based on the IOM recommendations, as part of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.

HyTime defines a set of hypertext-oriented element types that, in effect, supplement SGML and allow SGML document authors to build hypertext and multimedia presentations in a standardized way. HyTime is an international standard published by the ISO and IEC. The first edition was published in 1992, and the second edition was published in 1997.  Legacy  Some of the concepts formalized in HyTime were later incorporated into HTML and XML: * HTML is an application of SGML for hypertext document presentations, that assigns specific semantics and processing expectations to a fixed set of element types. * XML defines a simplified subset of SGML that focuses on providing an open vocabulary of element types for data modeling and establishes precise expectations for how the marked-up data is read and subsequently fed to another software application for further processing, but does not assign semantics to the element types or establish expectations for how the data is processed. * XLink was intended as a simplified version of HyTime for use in the XML world, but has not seen much adoption. * Work on applying HyTime to back-of-book indexes eventually led to the development of Topic Maps, which eventually became far more successful in its own right than HyTime ever was.

Pier 62 is on the left, with the driving range of Pier 59 partially visible on the right Chelsea Piers from the West Side Highway Golf club entrance Chelsea Piers is a series of piers in Chelsea, on the West Side of Manhattan in New York City. Located to the west of the West Side Highway (Eleventh Avenue) and Hudson River Park and to the east of the Hudson River, they were originally a passenger ship terminal in the early 1900s that was used by the RMS Lusitania and was the destination of the RMS Carpathia after rescuing the survivors of the RMS Titanic. The piers replaced a variety of run-down waterfront structures with a row of grand buildings embellished with pink granite facades. The piers are currently used by the Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex. The Complex is a 28-acre waterfront sports village located between 17th and 23rd Streets along Manhattan's Hudson River. This privately financed project opened in 1995. Situated on Piers 59, 60 and 61 and in the head house that connects them, the complex features the Golf Club, a multi-story driving range; the Field House, which contains numerous sports and training facilities; Sky Rink, which has two full-sized ice rinks; the Chelsea Piers Fitness health club; Bowlmor at Chelsea Piers, a bowling alley; and Sunset Terrace, a venue that hosts weddings. The complex also includes several event centers; the Studios film and television production facilities; and the Maritime Center marina for mooring private boats.  History  = Development and construction = Historically, the term Chelsea Piers referred to the luxury liner berths on Manhattan's west side from 1910 to the 1930s. With ocean liners such as the Titanic becoming bigger and bigger, New York City was looking for a new passenger ship dock in the early 1900s. The Army, which controls the location and size of piers, refused to let any piers extend beyond the existing pierhead line of the North River (the navigation name for the Hudson River south of 30th Street). Ship lines were reluctant to build north of 23rd Street because infrastructure was already in place, including the New York Central railway line and a ferry station near the river at 23rd Street. New York City solved the problem in an unusual way by actually taking away a block of land that was the 1837 landfill that extended Manhattan to 13th Avenue. The controversial decision included condemning many businesses. The city was unable to condemn the West Washington Street Market and was left to remain landfill. The market ultimately closed and the dock was converted to a sanitation facility that was used to load garbage barges headed for the Fresh Kills Landfill. The only section of 13th Avenue that remains is behind the sanitation facility, now a parking lot for sanitation trucks. The landfill is now called the Gansevoort Peninsula. The new piers were designed by the architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore, which also designed Grand Central Terminal. Under contracts let by the New York City Department of Dock and Ferries, the Chelsea Section Improvement, as it was officially called, replaced a hodgepodge of run-down waterfront structures with a row of grand buildings embellished with pink granite facades and formed the docking points for the rival Cunard Line and White Star Line. =Early 20th century= The RMS Carpathia at Pier 54 after the RMS Titanic rescue Most of the major trans- Atlantic liners of the day docked at the piers and they played pivotal roles in the RMS Titanic and RMS Lusitania disasters. The two most memorable moments for the pier were with the Lusitania and Titanic. The RMS Lusitania left her Cunard Pier 54 in 1915 before being torpedoed by German submarine U-20. The RMS Titanic was destined for the White Star pier 59 when she sank. Survivors were rescued on Cunard's RMS Carpathia. The Carpathia dropped off the Titanic's lifeboats at Pier 59 before going back south to Pier 54 where she unloaded the passengers and survivors. Thousands of people assembled at the dock to greet the ship. During the summer of 1920, a dramatic rally was organized on July 31 at the White Star Line docks. This was to send off Daniel Mannix, the Irish born Archbishop of Melbourne, Australia who had been outspoken on the English rule in Ireland, and successfully led anti conscription campaigns during WW1. A reported 15,000 New Yorkers turned up at Pier 60 at the foot of West 20th street to make sure Lloyd George would allow Mannix passage to Ireland. A luxury liner row was built between West 44th and West 52nd Street to handle larger liners in the 1930s. After New York moved its luxury liner piers to the New York Cruise Terminal between West 46th and West 54th Street in 1935 to accommodate bigger ships such as the RMS Queen Mary and the , the pier became a cargo terminal. During World War II the piers were used to deploy troops. The piers had catastrophic fires in 1932 and 1947 that destroyed some of the south piers. New construction resulted in new cargo piers used by the United States Lines and Grace line. In July 1936, the Chelsea Piers were the point of departure for Jesse Owens and the United States Olympic team as they left for the Summer Games in Berlin, Germany. =Late 20th century= In the 1980s, plans circulated to replace the West Side Elevated Highway with an at grade highway going along the West Side south of 42nd Street. The plan called for the highway to run over demolished piers. The superstructure of Pier 54 was demolished in 1991 except for the archway entrance (along with the White Star and Cunard signage). The plan (dubbed the Westway) was abandoned after court cases said the new highway would jeopardize striped bass. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy and other officials at the June 2012 ribbon cutting ceremony for Chelsea Piers Connecticut, the first expansion project of Chelsea Piers brand Following the demise of Westway, development of the West Side Highway evolved into two parts: a public/private partnership that evolved into the upper piers being used for recreational purposes. The southern piers are now part of the Hudson River Park while the northern piers make up the Chelsea Piers Sports & Entertainment Complex. Construction of the complex began on July 12, 1994 in ceremonies attended by New York Governor Mario Cuomo, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger. The complex opened in August 1995. Chelsea Piers Connecticut, the first expansion project of Chelsea Piers, was built in Stamford, Connecticut. The facility opened in July 2012. After the collapse of the World Trade Center due to the September 11 attacks, EMS triage centers were quickly relocated and consolidated at the Chelsea Piers and the Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal. The EMS triage center was shut down and disassembled on September 12, 2001, due to a lack of need. An ad hoc volunteer disaster recovery site was run from Chelsea Piers through September 16, 2001. Volunteers assisted with resources for ground zero recovery volunteers: sleeping area, food, and cell phones.  Piers 54/55  The archway is the only remaining identifiable piece of the pier Pier 54 in 2012 Piers 54 and 55 are being combined into one structure that will be completed in 2020. The new structure will contain a park. =Pier 54= Pier 54 at , part of the historic Chelsea Piers, is associated with the 1912 RMS Titanic and 1915 RMS Lusitania maritime disasters, when it was used by the Cunard Line. It is now part of Hudson River Park. The piers themselves are at Little West 12th Street and the Hudson River in the Meatpacking District/Greenwich Village neighborhood. The pier was also used for troop ships during World War II. After the war it was used as part of the W. R. Grace and Company and United States Lines freight operations. In 1998 the piers became part of the Hudson River Park. Since then they has been used for concerts and other events. In 2005, it was the site of The Nomadic Museum's art exhibit housed in shipping containers. Pier 54 was finally shut down in 2011 after it started to collapse. =Pier 55 park= Plans arose in November 2014 for a new park designed by Heatherwick Studio, with estimates of the park between $130 million and $160 million. Major backers included Barry Diller and Diane von Fürstenberg's joint foundation, which contributed $100 million to the project with plans to give up to $130 million. The city and state vowed to give $17 million and $18 million, respectively. The park, a partnership between Diller and von Furstenberg's foundation, the city and state, and Hudson River Park Trust, was to float completely above the water, resting on 300 concrete pillars. If the project were approved, construction was to begin in 2015 and end in 2018 or 2019. The project was provisionally known as Pier 55, and was to be built between the sites of Pier 54 and 56. Plans for the pier were scrapped in 2017 due to legal trouble and cost overruns, as the budget had gone over $200 million by then. In October 2017, the proposal was revived in exchange for Governor Andrew Cuomo agreeing to complete the remaining 30% of the incomplete Hudson River Park. Cuomo provided $50 million for the park in April 2018, but with the condition that the city raise a matching amount. Construction of the structure began the same month. The park would be supported by 132 pot-shaped structures suspended above the water, and would include a 700-seat amphitheater. A symbolic cornerstone was laid in December 2018, by which time the structure was proposed to be significantly completed by 2020. The new estimate for the project was $250 million. In 2019 the project was renamed Little Island.

(born March 24, 1943) is the former President of the North Carolina Community College System and former Chair of the National Council of State Directors of Community Colleges. He was also United States Representative from North Carolina from 1987 to 1995. Life and career Lancaster was raised on a tobacco farm in rural Wayne County, North Carolina and spent his childhood working in the fields; he went to the small local school and participated in local church youth activities. In 1957, he served as a Page in the North Carolina House of Representatives and in 1959, as Chief Page. In 1961, Lancaster went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and entered the law school at UNC after his junior year in college as a Law Alumni Scholar, graduating in 1967. After graduating, he joined the United States Navy, serving on active duty as a judge advocate for three years, eighteen months of which were spent on the USS Hancock (CV-19) off the coast of Vietnam. Lancaster continued to serve as a reservist until 1993. After his military service he returned to North Carolina and set up a law practice with a college classmate. In 1977, Governor Jim Hunt appointed him Chairman of the North Carolina Arts Council, a position he held for four years. This led to elective office, first to eight years in the North Carolina House of Representatives and ultimately to the U.S. Congress. In Congress, he served on the Armed Services, Small Business, Agriculture, and Merchant Marine & Fisheries Committees. His major committee was Armed Services. Lancaster also represented the House for six years at the Chemical Weapons Convention negotiations in Geneva. Lancaster was reelected three times without serious difficulty. However, in 1994 he faced a very credible Republican challenger in Walter Jones, Jr., a former Democratic state Representative who had recently switched parties. Lancaster's district had absorbed a large amount of the territory once represented by Jones' father, Walter B. Jones, Sr., in the 1990s round of redistricting. The race was initially fairly close until Walter, Jr. circulated a picture of Lancaster jogging with Bill Clinton, whose socially liberal stances (especially on allowing gays in the military) had angered voters in this socially conservative Eastern North Carolina district. In the general election, Jones defeated Lancaster by almost six points—one of many moderate Democrats in the South to be defeated in the Republican landslide that year. Lancaster worked briefly for Governor Jim Hunt handling federal issues. President Clinton then asked that he assist him with the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which he accepted. In the fall of 1995, the president nominated Lancaster to become Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, a position for which the U.S. Senate confirmed him in January 1996. In this capacity, Lancaster was primarily responsible for policy development and advocacy for the Army Corps of Engineers before the Office of Management and Budget, the White House, and the Congress. In 1997, Lancaster was chosen President of the North Carolina Community College System. Lancaster sought to increase state and private funding for facilities, equipment, faculty salaries and instruction and to strengthen the system's essential role in workforce and economic development. He led community college participation in the successful Higher Education Bond referendum of 2000, which included $600 million for community college construction, repair and renovation. He focused particular efforts on increasing the role of community colleges in preparing \\"homegrown teachers\\" for public schools and in workforce training for biotechnology and other high–tech industries. In the summer of 2003, he was elected Chair of the National Council of State Directors of Community Colleges. In March 2007, Lancaster announced that he would retire as system president in the spring of 2008.https://web.archive.org/web/20081012035114/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/554293.html After the announcement, a column in the (Raleigh) News and Observer praised his service, comparing him to former UNC system president William C.

Note the porphyry columns, and the richly carved capitals, bases and entablatures, of Flavian age (1st century). Interior. The domed octagonal Lateran Baptistery stands somewhat apart from the Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Rome, to which it has become joined by later construction. This baptistery was founded by Pope Sixtus III in 440, perhaps on an earlier structure, for a legend grew up that Constantine the Great had been baptized there and enriched the structure. However it is more likely that if he was baptized it was in the Eastern part of the Roman Empire and possibly by an Arian bishop.Head, Thomas, Medieval Hagiography, p. 93, note, 19 This baptistry was for many generations the only baptistery in Rome, and its octagonal structure, centered upon the large octagonal basin for full immersions, provided a model for others throughout Italy, and even an iconic motif of illuminated manuscripts, \\"The fountain of Life\\". Around the central area, where is the basin of the font, an octagon is formed by eight porphyry columns, with marble Corinthian capitals and entablature of classical form. On the ceiling of the Baptistry is the story of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312). An ambulatory surrounds the font and outer walls form a larger octagon. Attached to one side, towards the Lateran basilica, is a fine porch with two porphyry columns and richly carved capitals, bases and entablatures. The Baptistery was subject to an elaborate restoration during the pontificate of Urban VIII. While its interior architecture was consolidated and embellished after plans of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, a fresco cycle with scenes from the life of Constantine was added by Andrea Sacchi on the walls of the ambulatory. In the meantime the early Christian liturgy of Easter baptisms was reanimated by the baroque popes, baptizing adult \\"turchi ed ebrei\\" [\\"Turks and Jews\\"] in a public ceremony on Easter eve.Kirsten Lee Bierbaum: Die Ausstattung des Lateranbaptisteriums unter Urban VIII.

He is research director at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales, where he founded the Centre d'étude des mouvements sociaux. Touraine was an important figure in the founding of French sociology of work after World War II and later became an internationally-renowned sociologist of social movements, particularly the May 68 student movement in France and the Solidarity trade-union movement in communist Poland.  Biography  Touraine completed his khâgne (preparatory school) at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris, and entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1945. He left his studies at the ENS for a research trip in Hungary, and then worked at a mine in Valenciennes in 1947-1948 after his return to France. Touraine's work in the industrial milieu and his simultaneous discovery of the sociologist Georges Friedmann's Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel led him to return to studies in history at the ENS and to pass the agrégation in history in 1950. The same year, he became a researcher in sociology at the CNRS, working in the new subfield of sociology of work under Friedmann. Touraine conducted field research at the Renault auto factory in Boulogne-Billancourt in Paris, which would lead to his first sociological monograph, published in 1955. In 1952, he received a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study at Harvard with Talcott Parsons. Touraine defended his two doctoral theses at the University of Paris in 1964. His major thesis was published as Sociologie de l'action in 1965, and his minor thesis as La conscience ouvrière in 1966, both by Éditions du Seuil. Touraine is the father of two children: Marisol, who served as the French Minister of Social Affairs and Health from 2012 to 2017 in the government of Jean-Marc Ayrault and Manuel Valls; and Philippe, a professor of endocrinology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital in Paris. Work Part of the first generation of French sociologues du travail after World War II, Touraine was a pioneer of sociological fieldwork in industrial settings in France, drawing on the influence of American industrial sociology and industrial relations, as well as the survey research of Paul Lazarsfeld. Touraine's 1955 study of Renault articulated the \\"ABC\\" theory of automation which was adopted by 1960s radical sociologists of the \\"new working class,\\" including Serge Mallet. Touraine's mature work after 1960 is based on a \\"sociology of action\\", which he called \\"actionalism\\",Volkmar Gessner, David Nelken, European Ways of Law: Towards a European Sociology of Law (2007), p. 166. and believes that society shapes its future through structural mechanisms and its own social struggles. Expressed in his first theoretical statement, Sociologie de l'action, Touraine conceived \\"actionalism\\" as an alternative to the functionalism of Talcott Parsons, toward which he has frequently expressed disdain throughout his career. Touraine was a professor of sociology at Nanterre when the student movement of May 1968 broke out on its campus. Touraine observed the movement on the ground and wrote one of the first studies of it; 1968 marked a transition in his work away from labor and the working class toward social movements. Touraine, who in his 1960s work had been a major theorist of \\"industrial society,\\" published one of the first books articulating a concept of \\"post-industrial society\\" in 1969, though the American sociologists Daniel Bell and David Riesman had already been using the term. His prime interest for most of his career has been with social movements. He has studied and written extensively on workers' movements across the world, particularly in Latin America. In Poland where he observed and the emergence of the dissident movement Solidarnosc. While in Poland, he developed the research method of \\"Sociological Intervention,\\" which had been outlined in \\"The Voice and the Eye\\" (La Voix et le Regard) [1981]. Touraine has gained popularity in Latin America as well as in continental Europe. He has failed to gain the same recognition in the English-speaking world, although half of his books have been translated into English. He participated in 1969 at the Universitas project organized by Argentine architect Emilio Ambasz.  Honours  In 2010, he was jointly awarded, with Zygmunt Bauman, the Príncipe de Asturias Prize for Communication and the Humanities. Touraine received the Légion d’Honneur in 2014 during his daughter Marisol’s mandate as French Minister of Social Affairs. Selected publications * Touraine, A. (1965) Sociologie de l'action.

After the Cubs signed Enrique Wilson, Cedeño was sent back down to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. In 65 games at Iowa in 2005, Cedeño batted an impressive .355, and slugged over .500 for the first time in his professional career.

Cedeño made 118 starts at shortstop on the year with a brief trip to the disabled list in July with a concussion. He batted .249/.297/.339 with 13 errors.

The SER Ashford to Margate Broadstairs and Ramsgate (via Canterbury West) line was then extended south to Deal. This was linked up by the \\"Dover & Deal Joint Railway\\" with their bitter rival the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR). Upon the joint management of the SER and LCDR in 1899 the track layout at Ashford rationalised, with Thanet receiving similar treatment (by Southern) in the 1920s. The line was electrified under the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan, in \\"Kent Coast Electrification (Stage 2)\\" opening January 1961. The building of the railway was significant in the development of seaside resorts like Broadstairs.  Dover track layout  The Railway Clearing House produced a map that shows the complex layout of this area. This shows the separate connection to the pier where trains used to board ferries.

The president wears knee breeches, while his secretaries wear long trousers. Culottes are an item of clothing worn on the lower half of the body. The term can refer to split skirts, historical men's breeches, or women's under-pants; this is an example of fashion-industry words taken from designs across history, languages and cultures, then being used to describe different garments, often creating confusion among historians and readers. The French word culotte is (a pair of) panties, pants, knickers, trousers, shorts, or (historically) breeches; derived from the French word culot, meaning the lower half of a thing, the lower garment in this case. In English-speaking history culottes were originally the knee-breeches commonly worn by gentlemen of the European upper-classes from the late Middle Ages or Renaissance through the early nineteenth century. The style of tight trousers ending just below the knee was popularized in France during the reign of Henry III (1574–1589). Culottes were normally closed and fastened about the leg, to the knee, by buttons, a strap and buckle, or a draw-string. During the French Revolution of 1789–1799, working-class revolutionaries were known as the \\"sans-culottes\\" - literally, \\"without culottes\\" - a name derived from their rejection of aristocratic apparel. In the United States, the first five Presidents, from George Washington through James Monroe, wore culottes according to the style of the late 18th century. In military uniforms European Military uniforms incorporated culottes as a standard uniform article, the lower leg being covered by either stockings, leggings, or knee-high boots. Culottes were a common part of military uniforms during the European wars of the eighteenth- century (the Great Northern War, the War of the Spanish Succession, the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, the Franco-British Colonial Wars, and the American Revolution). Historical Japanese field workers and military Samurai wore hakama that were sometimes tight at the bottom as French military culottes. Wider bifurcated wrap-skirt hakama were for horse-back riding. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century European women introduced culottes cut with a pattern looking like long hakama, hiding their legs while riding horses. Today Aikido and Kendo masters wear long hakama, to hide their feet from opponents. Culottes for women In modern English, the use of the word culottes can mean a close fitting pair of pants ending at the knees,Calasibetta, Charlotte Mankey; Tortora, Phyllis (2010)The Fairchild Dictionary of Fashion. New York: Fairchild Books: . such as Lady Diana Spencer popularised during the early 1980s. The term is used as such in the United Kingdom and Canada. In this sense, culottes are similar to the American knickerbockers (knickers), except whereas the latter are loose in fit. Culottes can also, in some cases, describe a split or bifurcated skirt or any garment which \\"hangs like a skirt, but is actually pants.\\" During the Victorian Era (mid- to late-nineteenth century European culture) long split skirts were developed for horseback riding so that women could sit astride a horse with a man's saddle rather than riding side-saddle. Horse-riding culottes for women were controversial because they were used to break a sexual taboo against women riding horses when they were expected to hide their lower limbs at all times. Later, split skirts were developed to provide women more freedom to do other activities as well, such as gardening, cleaning, bike riding, etc. and still look like one is wearing a skirt. =School uniforms= Culottes are used in school uniforms for girls. They can be used along with skirts, or they may be used as a replacement for skirts. Culottes are worn as part of a uniform mainly to primary and middle schools. Culottes were also part of the uniform of UK Brownie Guides up until recently, when the uniform was modernized and the traditional brown culottes (and the navy blue culottes worn by the Girl Guides) were replaced. =Skorts= White pleated culottes with an interior view showing the leg separation In place of the term culotte, the term skort (a portmanteau for skirt and shorts) is more widely used in some areas. While some garments sold as culottes resemble short trousers, to truly be a skort it needs to look like a skirt. Thus, they differ from trousers or shorts by being much fuller at the bottom (hem) than at the waist. A skort is shorts that have a front covering to resemble a skirt or short pant legs with a same length or longer skirt sewn over the top. Some culottes have a part sewn over only the front, while some are shorts with a skirt sewn over them. While these may not be completely the same as skorts, they are often called by either name, so either term can apply. = Demi-denims = Demi- denims A cut which emerged in the 21st century - a combined silhouette of pants which appear to be made out of two separate garments. They look like slim fit jeans from behind, like a skirt or culottes worn on top of slim fit jeans - from the front. =Contemporary French under-pants= The term \\"culottes\\" in French is now used to describe women's panties, an article of clothing that has little or no relation to the historic men's culotte breeches, except that in French, calling something \\"culottes\\" is like calling them \\"bottoms\\". The historical French term \\"sans-culottes\\" which was once the rejection of aristocrats' breeches, is now used colloquially to mean the same as an English colloquialism \\"going commando\\" or not wearing under-pants.

In 1861, Patteson was selected as the first Bishop of the Anglican Church of Melanesia. He was killed on Nukapu, one of the easternmost islands of the Solomon Islands, on 20 September 1871. Consequently, he is commemorated in the Church of England on 20 September. Early life He was the elder son of Sir John Patteson the judge, by his second wife, Frances Duke Coleridge who was a niece of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Patteson was brought up in Devon at Feniton Court, where his family resided, so as to be near the home of his mother's relatives at Ottery St Mary. After three years at The King's School, Ottery St Mary, Patteson was placed in 1838 at Eton College, under his uncle, the Reverend Edward Coleridge, son-in-law of John Keate, once headmaster there. Patteson studied there until 1845. From 1845 to 1848, he was a commoner of Balliol College, Oxford, under Richard Jenkyns. He was not interested in academic studies, and obtained a second-class degree. However, at Oxford he began lifelong friendships with prominent figures such as Benjamin Jowett, Max Müller, John Campbell Shairp, Edwin Palmer, James Riddell, James John Hornby, and Charles Savile Roundell. Having earlier played for the Eton school XI,Miscellaneous matches played by John Patteson – CricketArchive. Retrieved 11 May 2015. Patteson continued his involvement with cricket at Oxford, playing for the Oxford University Cricket Club. In 1849, he appeared in the annual University Match against Cambridge University, which had first-class status.First-class matches played by John Patteson – CricketArchive. Retrieved 11 May 2015. In that match, he scored 25 runs in the first innings but only two in the second, with Oxford going on to lose by three wickets after being bowled out for 69 in its second innings.Oxford University v Cambridge University, University Match 1849 – CricketArchive. Retrieved 11 May 2015. After taking his degree in October 1849, Patteson travelled in Switzerland and Italy, learned German at Dresden, and devoted himself to the study of Hebrew and Arabic. Languages were to be a lifelong interest. Returning to Oxford in 1852, he became Fellow of Merton College, and spent the years 1852 and 1853 at the college, where there had been recent reform. Ordination On 25 September 1853, he was ordained as deacon and curate of Alphington, Devon, and on 24 September 1854 was ordained priest at Exeter Cathedral.Rutledge, Martha, \\"John Coleridge Patteson\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography On a visit in the summer of 1854, George Augustus Selwyn, the first Bishop of New Zealand, recruited Patteson as a missionary to the South Seas. Patteson left England with the bishop in March 1855, and landed at Auckland in May. Missionary work Patteson arrived at Auckland in May 1855. For five years, he toured the islands on the Southern Cross, visiting the indigenous peoples and teaching them about Christianity.\\"John Coleridge Patteson\\", Dictionary of New Zealand Biography He ran the Melanesian Mission's summer school at Kohimarama, Auckland. He also founded St Barnabas College on Norfolk Island, as a training centre for missionaries. On 24 February 1861, at Auckland, he was consecrated the first Bishop of Melanesia. It was not an easy calling: the islands were scattered over of ocean. He was not always welcomed, particularly since the native peoples were subject to abuses at the hands of blackbirders. These essentially stole men as labourers, transporting them away under harsh conditions. Usually Patteson's gentle, quiet manner reassured the indigenous peoples, but not always. Once when he and his assistants were about to leave Santa Cruz, they were shot at with arrows. Patteson's assistants were wounded, and the arrows turned out to be poisoned, since both ultimately died from the wounds.\\"The Story of John Coleridge Patteson\\", Ottery St. Mary Parish Church A brilliant linguist, Patteson eventually spoke 23 of the more than 1,000 Melanesian languages. He printed grammars and vocabularies and translated some gospels into the Mota language. Patteson was described as tall and athletic, with a grave and gentle face. In the islands he went barefoot, wearing only shirt and trousers, the latter tucked up above his knees. Following the example of Bishop Selwyn, when Patteson came to an island where he did not know the people and where they might be hostile, he used to swim ashore wearing a top hat. He had filled it with presents for the people. He quickly made friends, learnt the villagers' names, and enough of their language to use when he came again.Fox, Rev. Dr. C.E., \\"On The Occasion Of The Centenary Of The Consecration Of Bishop John Coleridge Patteson\\", February 24, 1961 Patteson's goal was to take boys from local communities, educate them in western Christian culture at his mission school, and return them to their villages to help lead the next generation. He had difficulty persuading local people to allow their young men to depart, sometimes for years, for this purpose. Patteson never tried to make the Melanesians British but thought he was equipping them for the contemporary world. His most brilliant scholar, Edward Wogala, wrote of him: \\"He did not live apart, he was always friends with us and did not despise in the least a single one of us.\\" Well liked by many, his name is still handed down from father to son, and in 1961, young Melanesians were still being named for him at baptism. In March 1864, Patteson visited Australia. In Sydney, he addressed a large meeting of British colonists, who pledged systematic support of the Melanesian Mission. Patteson devoted his private fortune to the mission, including money inherited from his father, and income from his Merton College fellowship. In 1867, he moved the Melanesian Mission to Norfolk Island, where it was called Saint Barnabas. In that milder climate, the school could continue in the winter months. Native foods, such as yams, could be grown so the students would feel more at home. Death The years of the slave trade in the late nineteenth century created problems for Patteson and other missionaries. Numerous British ships, known as blackbirders, sailed to the islands to recruit, often by deception and force, labourers to work on plantations in Australia or Fiji, under extremely harsh conditions. Sometimes ship captains ordered crews to cut off the heads of resisters, selling the heads at other islands and entering into the headhunter cultures. The slave-trade was technically illegal in the South Pacific at that time, and the traders called the natives indentured workers. Laws for their protection and return to their home islands were rarely enforced; the men were severely treated and many died; thousands of others were abandoned in the work islands. Patteson worked with the colonial government to suppress the blackbirders and their trade.Kiefer, James, \\"Biographical Sketches of Memorable Christians of the Past\\" His task was made harder when traders from Australia began to visit the islands, keen to get men to go and work on their sugar plantations. Usually they kept the law and agreed proper terms of employment: but some simply kidnapped the islanders and carried them off in what became known as \\"snatch-snatch\\" boats. On 20 September 1871, Patteson was killed on the island of Nukapu in the Solomon Islands, where he had landed alone. At the time, it was thought that natives killed him as revenge for the abduction of five men by illegal blackbirders a few days before, who had also killed one man. The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica says that Patteson was taken for a blackbirder and killed, but the natives realised their mistake and treated his body with respect, as it was found floating at sea, placed in \\"a canoe, covered with a palm fibre matting, and a palm-branch in his hand\\". Two Norwegian historians (Thorgeir Kolshus and Even Hovdhaugen, 2010) have examined the evidence in light of current interpretations related to agency and meanings given by the indigenous people. They have reviewed mission documents, as well as oral histories collected by ethnographers. They suggest that women, especially Niuvai, the wife of the paramount chief, played a more prominent role in the events. They led resistance to having their sons taken away to the distant mission school. Kolshus and Hovdhaugen argue that the natives may not have completely distinguished between the blackbirders and the missionaries, as both took young people away from the communities. Alternatively, Kolshus and Hovdhaugen also suggest that Patteson had upset the local hierarchy by giving gifts without due regard for precedence, and by cultivating support among women in the community. This was contrary to patriarchal norms. The men considered him a threat to their social order and killed him.  Legacy  Exeter Cathedral's Martyrs' Pulpit, designed by George Gilbert Scott As Bishop Patteson's death was associated with native resistance to the abuses of the blackbirders, the British government took measures to stamp out the slave trade in its Pacific territories. His death became a cause celebre in England; it increased interest both in missionary work and in improvement of the working conditions of labourers in Melanesia. The Aborigines' Protection Society took up the cause, resulting in a well- orchestrated campaign in Parliament from William McArthur for the annexation of Fiji to abolish slavery. Britain annexed Fiji in 1874.\\"Proposed Annexation of Fiji\\", Launceston Examiner, 21 June 1873 Patteson is celebrated in Anglican churches for his saintly life and as a martyr; he is commemorated with a Lesser Festival on 20 September, in the calendar of saints and other Anglican churches. A bas-relief memorial by Thomas Woolner was installed in the Merton College Chapel. The portrait portrays him surrounded by palm leaves, with an image below of him lying in the canoe, as described above. On Norfolk Island in 1882, the church of St Barnabas was erected to Patteson's memory, with windows designed by Edward Burne-Jones and executed by William Morris. In 1920, the Melanesian Mission was relocated from the island to the Solomon Islands to be closer to its target population. Port Patteson on Vanua LavaVanua Lava at Encyclopædia Britannica and Bishop Patteson Theological College in the Solomon Islands are both named after him. The Martyrs' Pulpit in the nave of Exeter Cathedral was erected in memory of Bishop Patteson who was ordained in the cathedral. It was designed by George Gilbert Scott in the 1870s.

It is based on the novel of the same name by oceanographer Ramón Bravo, who studied the species of shark known as 'tintorera' (a 19ft shark) and discovered the sleeping sharks of Isla Mujeres. The film, along with many monster movies of the 1970s and 1980s, is very similar to Jaws. It is also known by the alternative title Tintorera: Killer Shark. Quentin Tarantino paid tribute to this movie at the 8th Morelia International Film Festival, showing a copy from his private collection. Plot Steven (Hugo Stiglitz} a U.S.-born Mexican businessman, arrives in a Mexican resort village on a yacht anchored off shore. One of the local fishermen and the caretaker of the yacht, Colorado (Roberto Guzmán) takes Steven with him when he goes to haul in the sharks he's caught - and he's annoyed to find that another shark has taken a huge bite out of one of them. Steven then sets his sights on Patricia (Fiona Lewis), an Englishwoman on vacation. They have a whirlwind romance but break up when Steven can't decide if he's in love with her. Steven is extremely jealous, however, when she begins a relationship with Miguel (Andrés García) a womanising swimming instructor at the nearby resort hotel. While Steven stews on the yacht, Patricia and Miguel have sex. Then she goes skinny-dipping in the ocean and is eaten by a large, apparently emphysemic, tiger shark. The next day, Steven confronts Miguel in the hotel bar. Miguel tells Steven that Patricia was in love with Steven but she must have returned to England. Neither man ever learns of her true fate. Miguel introduces Steven to two sisters, American college students Kelly and Cynthia Madison (Jennifer Ashley and Laura Lyons). They go on a double date and, at the sisters' suggestion, swim to the yacht for some skinny-dipping. The shark's heavy, labored breathing can clearly be heard but they make it to the boat safely. Kelly and Cynthia then hop back and forth between Miguel's and Steven's beds. They all swim back to shore the next morning and the submerged tiger shark again chooses not to bother them. When Miguel and Steven start a shark hunting business, Miguel tells Steven that if a tiger shark ever appears, they must immediately get out of the water. One night, Miguel and Steven meet Gabriella (Susan George) a young English tourist. Miguel and Steven take Gabriella shark hunting with them. She's appalled by what they do, but admits her feelings for them have become powerful. The three of them decide to have a triangular relationship; she'll be sexually involved with both of them, but they won't fall in love with her or she with them. They tour the local Mayan archaeological sites together, then retire to the yacht for sex. The next time they go shark hunting, a shark appears and rips Miguel in half. Gabriella is so upset that she decides to return to England. Steven, meanwhile, vows revenge on the shark, enlisting the local coastguard and fishermen in a campaign to kill the tiger shark and seemingly every other shark in the area. \\"I hate the bastards\\", Steven tells him the troubled Colorado, who in turn assures him that so many sharks have been killed, the tiger shark must have been one of them. Meanwhile, unbeknown to Steven or Colorado, the tiger shark attacks another small fishing boat and eats two fishermen. Steven goes to a nighttime beach party with Kelly, Cynthia and two other American women (Priscilla Barnes and Pamela Garner) after the party ends, Kelly and Cynthia suggests more skinny-dipping. This time, the tiger shark attacks, ripping Cynthia from Steven's arms as he tries to make out with her in the water, as well as injuring the other two women, both of whom safely make it ashore. Steven vows to kill the shark himself. That evening, Steven lures the shark with a devilfish he's speared for the occasion, and when he hears the shark's rasping approach he shoots it with a speargun with an explosive charge. The shark rips off Steven's arm but it's finally destroyed by the explosive. Steven awakens in a hospital room, minus his right arm, thinking happy thoughts about his ménage à trois with Gabriella and Miguel.

The shark in the film was a Tiger shark. Locations were filmed at Isla Mujeres, a resort island near Cancún. All the underwater scenes were filmed with live sharks using the submarine expertise of Ramón Bravo. Due to the censorship imposed by the Mexican government at the time, there were two versions of the film prepared - the so-called uncut version, with plenty of explicit nudity, for foreign markets, and a cut version for domestic (Mexican) exhibition. It's now possible to find both versions on DVD. The original English dub in theatres and on video featured the voices of Susan George and Fiona Lewis, who played the two British tourists in the film.

The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 New Yorker article \\"Crisis in the Hot Zone\\". The filoviruses—including Ebola virus, Sudan virus, Marburg virus, and Ravn virus—are Biosafety Level 4 agents, extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high fatality rate, and most have no known prophylactic measures, treatments, or cures. Along with describing the history of the devastation caused by two of these Central African diseases, Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus disease, Preston described a 1989 incident in which a relative of Ebola virus, Reston virus, was discovered at a primate quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia, less than 15 miles (24 km) away from Washington, D.C.  Synopsis  The book is in four sections: * \\"The Shadow of Mount Elgon\\" delves into the history of filoviruses, as well as speculation about the origins of AIDS. Preston recounts the story of \\"Charles Monet\\" (a pseudonym), who might have caught Marburg virus from visiting Kitum Cave on Mount Elgon in Kenya. The author describes the progression of the disease, from the initial headache and backache, to the final stage in which Monet's internal organs fail and he hemorrhages extensively in a waiting room in a Nairobi hospital. This part also introduces a promising young physician who became infected with Marburg virus while treating Monet. Nancy Jaax's story is told. Viruses, biosafety levels and procedures were described. The Ebola virus disease outbreaks caused by Ebola virus and its cousin, Sudan virus, are mentioned. Preston talks to the man who named the Ebola virus. * \\"The Monkey House\\" chronicles the discovery of Reston virus among imported monkeys in Reston, Virginia, and the following actions taken by the U.S. Army and Centers for Disease Control. It starts with the monkey house receiving a shipment of 100 wild monkeys. After four weeks, 29 of these monkeys have died. This is followed by the veterinarian for the facility, Dan Dalgard, examining the dead monkeys and sending the samples to Peter Jahrling, a virologist at United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. After seeing a rope-like virus under the microscope, it is suspected that the monkeys were infected with a hot agent similar to the Marburg virus. Jahrling then conducts a blood test to find out that the hot agent is the Ebola Zaire virus. This conclusion leads to the Army Medical Research Institute deciding to euthanize all the monkeys in the same room as the infected monkeys. * \\"Smashdown\\" is more on the Reston epizootic, which involved a strain of the virus that does not affect humans but which easily spreads by air, and is very similar to its cousin the Ebola virus. * \\"Kitum Cave\\" tells of the author's visit to the cave that is the suspected home of the natural host animal in which Ebola lives. The book starts with \\"Charles Monet\\" visiting Kitum Cave during a camping trip to Mount Elgon in Central Africa. Not long after, he begins to suffer from a number of symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and red eye. He is taken to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, but his condition deteriorates further, and he goes into a coma while in the waiting room. This particular filovirus is called Marburg virus. Dr. Nancy Jaax had been promoted to work in the Level 4 Biosafety containment area at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and is assigned to research Ebola virus. While preparing food for her family at home, she cuts her right hand. Later, while working on a dead monkey infected with Ebola virus, one of the gloves on the hand with the open wound tears, and she is almost exposed to contaminated blood, but does not get infected. Nurse Mayinga is also infected by a nun and goes to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, where she succumbs to the disease. In Reston, Virginia, less than fifteen miles (24 km) away from Washington, D.C., a company called Hazelton Research once operated a quarantine center for monkeys that were destined for laboratories. In October 1989, when an unusually high number of their monkeys began to die, their veterinarian decided to send some samples to Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for study. Early during the testing process in biosafety level 3, when one of the flasks appeared to be contaminated with harmless pseudomonas bacterium, two USAMRIID scientists exposed themselves to the virus by wafting the flask. The virus found at the facility was a mutated form of the original Ebola virus and was initially mistaken for simian hemorrhagic fever virus. They later determine that, while the virus is lethal to monkeys, humans can be infected with it without any health effects at all. This virus is now known as Reston virus. Finally, the author goes to Africa to explore Kitum Cave. On the way, he discusses the role of AIDS in the present, as the Kinshasa Highway that he travels on was sometimes called the \\"AIDS Highway\\" after its early appearance in the region. Equipped with a hazmat suit, he enters the cave and finds a large number of animals, one of which might be the virus carrier. At the conclusion of the book, he travels to the quarantine facility in Reston. He finds the building abandoned and deteriorating. He concludes the book by claiming that Ebola will be back.  Reston virus outbreak  The discovery of the Reston virus was made in November 1989 by Thomas W. Geisbert, an intern at United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Dr. Peter B. Jahrling isolated the filovirus further. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted blood tests of the 178 animal handlers. While six tested positive, they did not exhibit any symptoms. The Reston virus was found to have low pathogenicity in humans. This was further supported later when a handler infected himself during a necropsy of an infected monkey, as the handler did not show symptoms of the virus after the incubation period.

When asked whether any book \\"scared the pants off you\\" writer Suzanne Collins answered \\"The Hot Zone, by Richard Preston. I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering.\\" The Hot Zone has received criticism for sensationalizing the effects of Ebola virus. In their memoir Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC (1996), former CDC scientists Joseph B. McCormick and Susan Fisher-Hoch lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact. McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident. In an interview about his book Ebola: The Natural and Human History of a Deadly Virus (2014), David Quammen claimed that The Hot Zone had \\"vivid, gruesome details\\" that gave an \\"exaggerated idea of Ebola over the years\\" causing \\"people to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon\\".Michaeleen Doucleff (November 11, 2014) How 'The Hot Zone' Got It Wrong And Other Tales Of Ebola's History NPR.org Retrieved March 16, 2020 Dramatizations =Failed film adaptation= In January 1993, 20th Century Fox producer Lynda Obst won a bidding war for the film rights to Preston's 1992 New Yorker article, which was still being transitioned into book form. In response to being outbid, Warner Bros. producer Arnold Kopelson immediately began working on a similarly themed production. This competing film, entitled Outbreak (and released in March 1995), was only vaguely inspired by Preston's work, but would ultimately be a factor in the collapse of Fox's planned production, Crisis in The Hot Zone. Directors considered for Crisis in The Hot Zone included Wolfgang Petersen (who would later direct Outbreak), Michael Mann, and Ridley Scott. Scott eventually signed on to direct the film in February 1994. Screenwriter James V. Hart was also signed to adapt the book. In late April 1994, Fox announced they had signed Robert Redford and Jodie Foster to star in the film. Crisis in The Hot Zone, however, was never made. Foster dropped out of the film just before filming was to begin and production was delayed, with Meryl Streep, Sharon Stone, and Robin Wright touted as possible replacements. In August 1994, Redford also dropped out of the film; a few days after Redford left it was announced that pre-production had been shut down. =Television series= On October 16, 2014, The Hollywood Reporter announced that Ridley Scott again planned to adapt the book, this time as a television miniseries for NatGeo. Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson, and Jeff Vintar wrote the pilot. Julianna Margulies starred as Nancy Jaax. Filming began in September 2018. Lynda Obst again produced the series. The miniseries aired from May 27 to May 29, 2019.  See also  * C.J.

The plant was shut down in 2013 after replacement steam generators failed; it is currently in the process of decommissioning. The plant is owned by Southern California Edison. Edison International, parent of SCE, holds 78.2% ownership in the plant; San Diego Gas & Electric Company, 20%; and the City of Riverside Utilities Department, 1.8%. When fully functional, it employed over 2,200 people. Located between the ocean and Interstate 5, the station is a prominent landmark because of its twin hemispherical containment buildings, which were designed to contain any unexpected releases of radioactive material from the power generators. The plant's first unit, Unit 1, operated from 1968 to 1992. Unit 2 was started in 1983 and Unit 3 started in 1984. Upgrades designed to last 20 years were made to the reactor units in 2009 and 2010; however, both reactors were shut down in January 2012 after premature wear was found on more than 3,000 tubes in replacement steam generators that had been installed in 2010 and 2011. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission investigated the events that led to the closure. In May 2013, Senator Barbara Boxer, the then-chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, said the modifications had proved to be \\"unsafe and posed a danger to the eight million people living within 50 miles of the plant,\\" and she called for a criminal investigation. In June 2013, Southern California Edison announced the permanent retirement of Unit 2 and Unit 3, citing \\"continuing uncertainty about when or if SONGS might return to service\\" and noting that ongoing regulatory and \\"administrative processes and appeals\\" would likely cause any tentative restart plans to be delayed for \\"more than a year\\". The company stated that \\"Full retirement of the units prior to decommissioning will take some years in accordance with customary practices. Actual decommissioning will take many years until completion.\\" Controversy continues over Edison's plans for on-site dry cask storage of the considerable amount of nuclear waste created during the facility's decades of operation. Reactors Unit 1 in 1975 Units 2 and 3 in 2012 Unit 1, a first- generation Westinghouse pressurized water reactor that operated for 25 years, closed permanently in 1992; it has been dismantled and is used as a storage site for spent fuel. It had a spherical containment of concrete and steel; the smallest wall was thick. It generated 456 MWe gross, and 436 MWe net, when operating at 100% capacity. Units 2 and 3, Combustion Engineering two-loop pressurized water reactors, generated 1,127 MWe gross, and 1,070 MWe and 1,080 MWe net respectively, when operating at 100% capacity. In a ten-year project completed in 2011 and costing $671 million, Edison replaced the steam generators in both reactors with Mitsubishi steam generators of modified design. Because of the reactors' two-loop design, uncommon for such large reactors of that era, the steam generators were among the largest in the industry. A common shortcoming of these large steam generators was tube wear, requiring replacement earlier than their 40-year design life. The steam generators being the largest components in the reactor required a temporary hole through the concrete containment shell. The Unit 2 replacement was completed in 2009 and Unit 3 in 2011. Edison estimated that the modernization would save customers $1 billion during the plant's license period, which at the time ran until 2022. During its operation until 2012, SONGS provided about 20% of the power to large portions of Southern California. Safety issues The San Onofre station had technical problems over the years. In July 1982, Time wrote, \\"The firm Bechtel was ... embarrassed in 1977, when it installed a 420-ton nuclear-reactor vessel backwards\\" at San Onofre. In 2008, the San Onofre plant received multiple citations over issues such as failed emergency generators, improperly wired batteries and falsified fire safety data. In its annual review of 2011, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) identified improvements but noted that in the area of human performance, \\"corrective actions to date have not resulted in sustained and measurable improvement\\". According to the NRC, workers at San Onofre were \\"afraid they will be retaliated against if they bring up safety problems, something that's against the rules\\". As of 2011, according to the NRC, there had been progress on the issue and the problems were not considered a threat to the safety of plant workers or the public. In November 2011, there was an ammonia leak, and as a precaution company employees were evacuated from the leak area, while the units continued normal operation. A mid-cycle inspection report spanning July 2011 to June 2012 revealed three incidents relating to human performance. An additional issue concerned a failure to develop procedures for a \\"cyber security analysis of electronic devices\\" that was later corrected. In 2012, coolant fluid was found in the oil system of a backup diesel generator, which would have caused the generator to fail if needed. An internal investigation found \\"evidence of potential tampering\\", making sabotage by staff a possible cause. =Environmental risk and mitigation= Southern California Edison stated after the Fukushima disaster in 2011 that the station was \\"built to withstand a 7.0 magnitude earthquake directly under the plant\\". Additionally, there was a 25-foot wall to protect the plant from a tsunami which could be potentially generated by the active fault 5 miles offshore. The closest tectonic fault line is the Christianitos fault, less than a mile away, which is considered inactive or \\"dead\\", but other active faults in the vicinity might pose some threat. The NRC's estimate of the yearly risk of an earthquake intense enough to cause core damage to the reactor at San Onofre was 1 in 58,824, according to a study it had published in August 2010.Bill Dedman, \\"What are the odds? US nuke plants ranked by quake risk,\\" NBC News, March 17, 2011 http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42103936 Accessed April 19, 2011. In June 2012 S. David Freeman, the former head of the Southern California Public Power Authority and \\"a longtime anti-nuclear voice\\", described San Onofre and Diablo Canyon as \\"disasters waiting to happen: aging, unreliable reactors sitting near earthquake fault zones on the fragile Pacific Coast, with millions of Californians living nearby\\". The San Onofre plant used seawater for cooling, like some other seaside facilities in Southern California, lacking the large cooling towers typically associated with nuclear generating stations. Limited available land next to SONGS would likely have required towers to be built on the opposite side of Interstate 5. More than 4,000 tons of radioactive waste are stored at San Onofre. =Surrounding population= The NRC defines two emergency planning zones around nuclear power plants: 1) a plume exposure pathway zone with a radius of , concerned primarily with exposure to, and inhalation of, airborne radioactive contamination, and 2) an ingestion pathway zone of about , concerned primarily with ingestion of food and liquid contaminated by radioactivity. The average prevailing westerly wind direction at San Onofre blows inland 9 months of the year.http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi- bin/clilcd.pl?ca23188 The 2010 U.S. population within of San Onofre was 92,687, an increase of 50.0 percent in a decade, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data for msnbc.com. The 2010 U.S. population within was 8,460,508, an increase of 14.9 percent since 2000.Bill Dedman, Nuclear neighbors: Population rises near US reactors, NBC News, April 14, 2011 http://www.nbcnews.com/id/42555888 Accessed May 1, 2011. Three of the cities within 20 miles of the facility are San Clemente and Laguna Beach in Orange County and Oceanside in San Diego County. San Diego is 45 miles south of the facility, and Los Angeles is 60 miles north of the facility. Anti-nuclear protests, 1977– present On August 6, 1977, about a thousand anti-nuclear protesters marched outside the nuclear generation station, while units 2 & 3 were under construction. On June 22, 1980, in the wake of the Three Mile Island accident, about 15,000 people attended a protest rally against the San Onofre nuclear plant that was organized by the Southern California Alliance For Survival.Williams, Eesha. Wikipedia distorts nuclear history Valley Post, May 1, 2008 Among the speakers was physicist Michio Kaku, who noted that one of the reactor pressure vessels had been installed backwards and called on California governor Jerry Brown (then considered an environmentalist) to shut them down. On March 11, 2012, more than 200 activists protested at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station to mark the one-year anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Two Japanese residents who lived through the Fukushima meltdowns, and Raymond Lutz spoke. They said the generators which had been offline since January 2012, should remain off. In May 2012, environmental and anti-nuclear activists gathered at Southern California Edison's Irvine headquarters calling for the San Onofre plant to be decommissioned. Shutdown, 2012 and closure, 2013 Units 2 and 3 after shutdown.https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/us/californians-consider-a-future- without-a-nuclear-plant-for-a-neighbor.html =Initial shutdown= Unit 2 was shut down in early January 2012 for routine refueling and replacement of the reactor vessel head. On January 31, 2012, Unit 3 suffered a radioactive leak largely inside the containment shell, with a release to the environment below allowable limits, and the reactor was shut down per standard procedure. On investigation, the replacement steam generators from 2011 in both units were found to show premature wear on over 3,000 tubes, in 15,000 places. Plant officials pledged not to restart until the causes of the tube leak and tube degradation were understood. Neither unit was ever restarted. There were no blackouts due to the lack of SONGS electricity; more pollution was caused by the use of natural gas plants to make up for the lost power generation, and additional cost led to higher utility bills. =NRC, SCE and public response= In March 2012, the NRC forbade the plant to be reopened until the causes of its equipment problems were thoroughly understood and fixed. At the same time, Irvine Councilman Larry Agran called for the plant to be decommissioned safely and as soon as possible. Concerns included \\"nuclear waste stored at the plant, health hazards from radioactive material, and inadequate evacuation plans\\". Resolutions passed in neighboring cities Laguna Beach and San Clemente called for safer and more secure nuclear waste storage. San Clemente voted to request public information about radiation levels near the plant. The spokesman for Edison International said \\"the company will work to prepare detailed responses to council and community member questions and concerns\\". In June 2012 the environmental group Friends of the Earth filed a legal petition with the NRC, asking that any decision to restart SONGS be considered a de facto NRC license amendment which required a public hearing, rather than a decision by the NRC commissioners. Friends of the Earth submitted evidence and sworn statements of John Large of the London-based nuclear consulting engineers Large & Associates, demonstrating that the steam generating tube degradation was a generic fault of the Mitsubishi design and that Edison's power derating of the two nuclear units would not lower the rate of wear or the risk of catastrophic tube failure. SCE and NRC staff filed statements opposing the petition. In July 2012, the NRC's final report identified ten issues that needed followup and stated \\"the plant will not be permitted to restart until the licensee has developed a plan to prevent further steam generator tube degradation and the NRC independently verifies that it can be operated safely.\\" , the cost related to the shutdown had reached $165 million, with $117 million of that being the purchasing of power from other sources to replace the output of the plant. The Chairman of Edison International Ted Craver stated the possibility that reactor 3 might be scrapped as \\"It is not clear at this time whether Unit 3 will be able to restart without extensive additional repairs\\". In August 2012, Southern California Edison announced plans to lay off one-third, or 730, of the plants employees; the company said that the downsizing had been planned more than two years before. Rochelle Becker of the Alliance for Nuclear Responsibility said the layoffs showed that the company was not honest about their plans for the power plant. In September 2012, Allison Macfarlane, the NRC Chairwoman, said that the plant would be down for a prolonged period, and that Unit 3 would be defueled in September 2012 because the unit had been significantly damaged. Due to the shutdown, the NRC ended requirements to monitor non-operating systems. In October 2012, SCE submitted a \\"Unit 2 Return to Service Report\\" about corrective actions, such as plugging worn tubes and preventively plugged additional tubes. It proposed a restart limiting Unit 2 to 70% power, to prevent excessive tube vibration, until an inspection within 150 days of operation. SCE reported that most of the excessive wear had been in limited areas, due to higher speed and drier steam than computer modeling had predicted, and inadequate tube support at the U-bend. Analysis had concluded operating at 70% power would eliminate the conditions that caused excessive wear. In November 2012, the NRC decided to refer the Friends of the Earth hearing request to the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board. By November 2012, the cost of the outage was over $300 million, and discussion of restarting Unit 2 had been postponed. In December 2012, the last of the four old steam generators was transported to Clive, Utah for disposal. In February 2013, the NRC asked the steam generator manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to provide a redacted version of a report on the plant's steam generators for publication. The report described the changes made in the replacement steam generator including the removal of a support cylinder, changes to the tube support plates and anti-vibration bars, and addition of about 400 tubes. In December 2013, the NRC cited SONGS for failing to properly check the steam generator design, which had caused the plant shutdown. The finding did not carry any fine or penalty but complicated SCE's legal position that they did nothing wrong. The California Public Utilities Commission was considering whether to order a multimillion-dollar refund to SCE customers. =Atomic Safety and Licensing Board ruling, May 2013= On May 13, 2013, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board issued its decision on the Friends of the Earth hearing request filed in June 2012. It determined the current NRC process on this issue constituted a de facto license amendment requiring an adjudicatory public hearing, for three independent reasons: #the SCE proposal to limit unit 2 to 70% power is inconsistent with the license, so constitutes an amendment; #unit 2 cannot safely operate within the full license scope, so the license needs to be amended; #restarting the plant with the steam generator tubes in the current degraded state is outside historical experience, and the proposal to operate them at 70% power for a limited duration before reinspection constituted the regulatory definition of \\"tests or experiments\\", requiring a license amendment. In May 2013, Senator Barbara Boxer asked that the United States Justice Department investigate possible malfeasance by Edison officials, and released a 2004 letter by an Edison executive that expressed worries that the new steam generators, though similar, would not be \\"like for like\\" replacements and could lead to the same kind of potential \\"disastrous\\" issues that in fact led to the plant's shutdown in 2012. In making the request for a possible criminal investigation, Boxer stated \\"This correspondence leads me to believe that Edison intentionally misled the public and regulators in order to avoid a full safety review and public hearing in connection with its redesign of the plant.\\" Edison denied any wrongdoing. but reportedly signaled it might shut the plant down for good should the company not be allowed to restart one of the reactors at 70% of capacity. =Plant closure, June 2013= On June 7, 2013, Southern California Edison announced it would \\"permanently retire\\" Unit 2 and Unit 3, ending their attempt to restart the plant at a reduced capacity. The utility said it would cut the SONGS workforce from about 1,500 to some 400 employees, with most reductions \\"expected to occur in 2013\\". The company also said it would \\"pursue recovery of damages from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the supplier of the replacement steam generators\\", although the contract limited liability to $138 million and excluded consequential damages. The chief executive of Edison International explained that the current licenses expire in 2022, and with post-Fukushima requirements, which include re-evaluating earthquake vulnerability, it was uncertain renewal would be economic, so it made little sense making costly and politically difficult repairs now that would not make a return on investment before 2022. California Senator Dianne Feinstein signaled approval of the decision to permanently close the plant, stating \\"I firmly believe this is the right thing to do for the more than 7 million Californians who live within 50 miles of San Onofre.\\" However, Representative Darrell Issa, whose voting district includes the nuclear station, was more downbeat, saying \\"our communities now face the loss of employment for more than a thousand highly skilled workers and an essential local source of low-cost, clean energy.\\" Issa also pledged to work to improve the prospects for nuclear power nationwide. In contrast, Sierra Club Director Kathryn Phillips applauded the move, saying in a statement that \\"We hope, especially, that the utilities will take this opportunity to help get more locally generated renewable energy, such as rooftop solar, into their portfolios.\\" In 2015, State Attorney General Kamala Harris opened an investigation of the Office of Ratepayer Advocates, San Diego Gas and Electric, and Southern California Edison. California state investigators searched the home of California utility regulator Michael Peevey and found hand written notes, which showed that Peevey had met with an Edison executive in Poland, where the two had negotiated the terms of the San Onofre settlement leaving San Diego taxpayers with a $3.3 billion bill to pay for the closure of the plant. The investigation was closed amidst Harris' 2016 run for the US Senate position, which opened when Barbara Boxer retired. =Environmental impact= Total greenhouse gas emissions from power plants in California increased by 35% from 2011 to 2012, according to figures from the California Air Resources Board, which per the World Nuclear News is partly due to the early closure of San Onofre.http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/EE-California- emissions-rise-on-San-Onofre-shut-down-0511135.html =Decommissioning, 2014–present= Decommissioning San Onofre will take numerous years until the process is complete. In February 2014 SCE announced that it would be auctioning off non-radioactive equipment from the former nuclear plant March 2015. In August 2014, SCE announced decommissioning would take 20 years, cost $4.4 billion and spent fuel would be held on-site in dry casks indefinitely, while Low Level Radioactive Waste would be disposed in Texas and Utah. On December 20, 2016, SCE announced it had selected a joint venture of AECOM and EnergySolutions as decommissioning general contractor for SONGS. = Nuclear Waste Issue = Since the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository plan was terminated in 2008, nuclear waste will have to be stored on site in San Onofre until Congress finds another location for a nuclear waste repository. SONG's nuclear waste is in steel-lined concrete pools known as wet storage. According to the NRC, nuclear waste must sit in these pools for about 5 years in order to cool. It then must be transferred into a more permanent, dry storage, consisting of 80 underground steel lined concrete monoliths. SCE decided on Holtec International to design the dry storage canisters. The canisters will be thick compared to the thickness used for most other canisters in the US. These steel-lined concrete monoliths right next to the Pacific Ocean exceed California's earthquake requirements and Edison says they are designed to withstand fire and tsunamis. The canisters are prone to cracking mainly because of chloride-induced, stress-corrosion from being close to the ocean. The canisters cannot be inspected for cracks. Kris Singh, president and CEO of Holtec, says that they are working on developing inspection methods, but that even if cracks could be detected, there is no way to repair them. As an added safety measure, Holtec is providing an extra canister on site. The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) will be using new technologies in order to detect and protect these canisters from cracking. EPRI believes the best method for chloride-induced, stress-corrosion cracking is to apply proactive practices, which include using standard methods to classify the corrosivity of the site environment, monitoring the site specific absolute humidity, and planning for visual inspection of the canister surface in a timeframe based on the results\\". In April 2017 Southern California Edison agreed to move spent nuclear fuel off the site, following legal action by San Diego environmental group Citizens Oversight. In July 2020, the California Coastal Commission approved an inspection and maintenance program that will allow Southern California Edison to continue to store spent nuclear fuel in a storage site at San Onofre. =Financial settlement= In July 2013 SCE started a 90-day dispute resolution process with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. The dispute resolution was unsuccessful, so a binding arbitration process run by the International Chamber of Commerce commenced in October 2013. SCE claimed $7.57 billion (930 billion yen), but MHI argues that compensation is limited to $137 million by their contract. In October 2015 the owners reached a $400 million settlement with their insurers for outages caused by the failure. SCE received $312.8 million, SDG&E; $80 million, and the city of Riverside $7.16 million. The arbitration claim against MHI continued to be pursued through the International Chamber of Commerce. In March 2017 the International Chamber of Commerce ordered MHI to pay $125 million compensation, the liability limit contained in the contract. The tribunal rejected claims of fraud and gross negligence against Mitsubishi, and ordered the claimants to pay MHI $58 million in legal fees and costs. In popular culture The San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station is shown in the 1987 film Made in U.S.A. directed by Ken Friedman and starring Adrian Pasdar, Chris Penn and Lori Singer. SONGS was also featured in Godfrey Reggio's 1982 experimental film Koyaanisqatsi, where sunbathers are shown on San Onofre State Beach in front of the station.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085809/locations Passing reference is made to the design of the containment shields (which resemble breasts) in the lyrics of the Descendents song \\"Kids\\" from their 1986 album I Don't Want To Grow Up, and in the cult comedy The Naked Gun (1987).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTxFFWajIII The nuclear generating station was also used as a backdrop for the non-descript Californian nuclear reactor in the film Cloud Atlas (2012). Unit 1 was shown in a season 2 episode of Batman in 1967, \\"The Mad Hatter Runs Afoul\\". It is also shown in the 2017 series Animal Kingdom as the backdrop to several surf scenes.

While the avenue has different names at different points in Manhattan, it is actually one continuous stretch of road. Description Hearst Tower at West 57th Street and Eighth Avenue Eighth Avenue begins in the West Village neighborhood at Abingdon Square (where Hudson Street becomes Eighth Avenue at an intersection with Bleecker Street) and runs north for 44 blocks through Chelsea, the Garment District, Hell's Kitchen's east end, Midtown and the Broadway theatre district in the eponymous neighborhood, before it finally enters Columbus Circle at 59th Street and becomes Central Park West. North of Frederick Douglass Circle, it resumes its Eighth Avenue designation, but is also known as Frederick Douglass Boulevard. The avenue ends north of 155th Street, and merges into the Harlem River Drive. The New York City Subway's IND Eighth Avenue Line, serving the in Lower Manhattan and the in the Upper West Side, runs under Eighth Avenue. MTA Regional Bus Operations primarily operates two bus routes on the avenue. The northbound serves Eighth Avenue between Abingdon Square and Columbus Circle, while the serves the length of Eighth Avenue north of 59th Street in its entirety. = Southernmost section = The southernmost section is known solely as Eighth Avenue between Abingdon Square and Columbus Circle. This portion of Eighth Avenue has carried traffic one-way northbound since June 6, 1954. Since the 1990s, the stretch of Eighth Avenue that runs through Greenwich Village and its adjacent Chelsea neighborhood has been a center of the city's gay community, with bars and restaurants catering to gay men. New York City's annual gay pride parade takes place along the Greenwich Village section of Eighth Avenue. Also, along with Times Square, the portion of Eighth Avenue from 42nd Street to 50th Street was an informal red-light district in the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s before it was controversially renovated into a more family friendly environment under the first mayoral administration of Rudolph Giuliani. =Central Park West= The American Museum of Natural History Housing cooperatives on CPW: The San Remo (far right), The Langham (center-right), The Dakota (center-left), and The Majestic (far left). North of Columbus Circle, the roadway becomes Central Park West (abbreviated to CPW). Unlike many Manhattan avenues, CPW has traffic running in two directions, and its address numbering system is different than that of the rest of Eighth Avenue. As its name indicates, CPW forms the western edge of Central Park. It also forms the eastern boundary of the Upper West Side. It runs 51 blocks from Columbus Circle (at 59th Street, or Central Park South) to Frederick Douglass Circle (at 110th Street, or Cathedral Parkway). The gates into Central Park along its western edge are: Merchants Gate at 59th Street, Women's Gate at 72nd, Naturalists Gate at 77th, Hunters Gate at 81st, Mariners Gate at 85th, Gate of All Saints at 96th, Boys Gate at 100th, and Strangers Gate at 106th. Central Park West's expensive housing rivals that of Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side. Several famous residences are located on Central Park West, including: * The Dakota, where John Lennon lived with current resident Yoko Ono,Weiss, Shari (December 8, 2010). \\"Yoko Ono on anniversary of John Lennon's death: I still can't bear to leave our home at The Dakota\\".

An heirloom plant, heirloom variety, heritage fruit (Australia and New Zealand), or heirloom vegetable (especially in Ireland and the UK) is an old cultivar of a plant used for food that is grown and maintained by gardeners and farmers, particularly in isolated or ethnic minority communities of the Western world. These were commonly grown during earlier periods in human history, but are not used in modern large-scale agriculture. In some parts of the world, it is illegal to sell seeds of cultivars that are not listed as approved for sale. The Henry Doubleday Research Association, now known as Garden Organic, responded to this legislation by setting up the Heritage Seed Library to preserve seeds of as many of the older cultivars as possible. However, seed banks alone have not been able to provide sufficient insurance against catastrophic loss. In some jurisdictions, like Colombia, laws have been proposed that would make seed saving itself illegal. Many heirloom vegetables have kept their traits through open pollination, while fruit varieties such as apples have been propagated over the centuries through grafts and cuttings. The trend of growing heirloom plants in gardens has been returning in popularity in North America and Europe. Origin A selection of heirloom tomatoes Before the industrialization of agriculture, a much wider variety of plant foods were grown for human consumption, largely due to farmers and gardeners saving seeds and cuttings for future planting. From the 16th century through the early 20th centuries, the diversity was huge. Old nursery catalogues were filled with plums, peaches, pears and apples of numerous varieties and seed catalogs offered legions of vegetable varieties. Valuable and carefully selected seeds were sold and traded using these catalogs along with useful advice on cultivation. Since World War II, agriculture in the industrialized world has mostly consisted of food crops which are grown in large, monocultural plots. In order to maximize consistency, few varieties of each type of crop are grown. These varieties are often selected for their productivity and their ability to ripen at the same time while withstanding mechanical picking and cross-country shipping, as well as their tolerance to drought, frost, or pesticides. This form of agriculture has led to a 75% drop in crop genetic diversity. While heirloom gardening has maintained a niche community, in recent years it has seen a resurgence in response to the industrial agriculture trend. In the Global South, heirloom plants are still widely grown, for example, in the home gardens of South and Southeast Asia. Before World War II, the majority of produce grown in the United States was heirlooms. In the 21st century, numerous community groups all over the world are working to preserve historic varieties to make a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, herbs, and flowers available again to the home gardener, by renovating old orchards, sourcing historic fruit varieties, engaging in seed swaps, and encouraging community participation. Requirements The definition and use of the word heirloom to describe plants is fiercely debated. One school of thought places an age or date point on the cultivars. For instance, one school says the cultivar must be over 100 years old, others 50 years, and others prefer the date of 1945, which marks the end of World War II and roughly the beginning of widespread hybrid use by growers and seed companies. Many gardeners consider 1951 to be the latest year a plant could have originated and still be called an heirloom, since that year marked the widespread introduction of the first hybrid varieties. It was in the 1970s that hybrid seeds began to proliferate in the commercial seed trade. Some heirloom varieties are much older; some are apparently pre-historic. Another way of defining heirloom cultivars is to use the definition of the word heirloom in its truest sense. Under this interpretation, a true heirloom is a cultivar that has been nurtured, selected, and handed down from one family member to another for many generations. Additionally, there is another category of cultivars that could be classified as \\"commercial heirlooms\\": cultivars that were introduced many generations ago and were of such merit that they have been saved, maintained and handed down – even if the seed company has gone out of business or otherwise dropped the line. Additionally, many old commercial releases have actually been family heirlooms that a seed company obtained and introduced. Regardless of a person's specific interpretation, most authorities agree that heirlooms, by definition, must be open-pollinated. They may also be open-pollinated varieties that were bred and stabilized using classic breeding practices. While there are no genetically modified tomatoes available for commercial or home use, it is generally agreed that no genetically modified organisms can be considered heirloom cultivars. Another important point of discussion is that without the ongoing growing and storage of heirloom plants, the seed companies and the government will control all seed distribution. Most, if not all, hybrid plants, if they don't have sterile seeds and can be regrown, will not be the same as the original hybrid plant, thus ensuring the dependency on seed distributors for future crops. Collection sites The heritage fruit trees that exist today are clonally descended from trees of antiquity. Heirloom roses are sometimes collected (nondestructively as small cuttings) from vintage homes and from cemeteries, where they were once planted at gravesites by mourners and left undisturbed in the decades since. Modern production methods and the rise in population have largely supplanted this practice. UK and EU law and national lists In the UK and Europe, it is thought that many heritage vegetable varieties (perhaps over 2,000) have been lost since the 1970s, when EEC (now EU) laws were passed making it illegal to sell any vegetable cultivar not on the national list of any EEC country. This was set up to help in eliminating seed suppliers selling one seed as another, guarantee the seeds were true to type, and that they germinated consistently. Thus, there were stringent tests to assess varieties, with a view to ensuring they remain the same from one generation to the next. These tests (called DUS) assess \\"distinctness\\", \\"uniformity\\", and \\"stability\\". But since some heritage cultivars are not necessarily uniform from plant to plant, or indeed within a single plant—a single cultivar—this has been a sticking point. \\"Distinctness\\" has been a problem, moreover, because many cultivars have several names, perhaps coming from different areas or countries (e.g., carrot cultivar Long Surrey Red is also known as \\"Red Intermediate\\", \\"St. Valery\\", and \\"Chertsey\\"). However, it has been ascertained that some of these varieties that look similar are in fact different cultivars. On the other hand, two that were known to be different cultivars were almost identical to each other, thus one would be dropped from the national list in order to clean it up. Another problem has been the fact that it is somewhat expensive to register and then maintain a cultivar on a national list. Therefore, if no seed breeder or supplier thinks it will sell well, no one will maintain it on a list, and so the seed will not be re-bred by commercial seed breeders. In recent years, progress has been made in the UK to set up allowances and less stringent tests for heritage varieties on a B national list, but this is still under consideration. When heirloom plants are not being sold, however, laws are often more lenient. Because most heirloom plants are at least 50 years old and grown and swapped in a family or community they fall under the public domain. Another worldwide alternative is to submit heirloom seeds to a seedbank. These public repositories in turn maintain and disburse these genetics to anyone who will use them appropriately. Typically, approved uses are breeding, study, and sometimes, further distribution. US state law There are a variety of intellectual property protections and laws that are applied to heirloom seeds which can often differ greatly between states. Plant patents are based on the Plant Patent Act of 1930 which protects plants grown from cuttings and division, while under intellectual property rights, the Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 (PVPA) shields non-hybrid, seed-propagated plants. However, seed breeders can only shelter their variety for 20 years under PVPA. There are also a couple exceptions under the PVPA which allow growers to cultivate, save seeds, and sell the resultant crops as well as give breeders allowances to use PVPA protected varieties as starter material as long as it constitutes less than half of the breeding material. There are also seed licenses which may place restrictions on the use of seeds or trademarks that guard against the use of certain plant variety names. In 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture caused a seed-lending library to shut down and promised to curtail any similar efforts in the state. The lending library, hosted by a town library, allowed gardeners to \\"check out\\" a package of open-pollinated seed, and \\"return\\" seeds kept from the crop grown from those seeds. The Department of Agriculture said that this activity raises the possibility of \\"agro-terrorism\\", and that a Seed Act of 2004 requires the library staff to test each seed packet for germination rate and whether the seed was true to type. In 2016 the department reversed this decision, and clarified that seed libraries and non-commercial seed exchanges are not subject to the requirements of the Seed Act.  Future  As the effects of climate change intensify and the world population rises, more attention is being put on heirloom plants as a way to restore genetic diversity and feed a growing population while safeguarding the food supply of diverse regions. Specific heirloom plants are often selected, saved, and planted again because of their superior performance in a particular locality. Over many crop cycles these plants develop unique adaptive qualities to their environment which empowers local communities and can be vital to maintaining the genetic resources of the world.

The new problem is satisfiable if and only if the original problem was, and solutions can be converted easily from one problem to the other. There are a number of algorithms for constraint satisfaction that work only on constraints that have at most two variables. If a problem has constraints with a larger arity (number of variables), conversion into a problem made of binary constraints allows for execution of these solving algorithms. Constraints with one, two, or more variables are called unary, binary, or higher-order constraints. The number of variables in a constraint is called its arity. The hidden transformation replaces each constraint with a new, hidden variable. The hidden transformation converts an arbitrary constraint satisfaction problem into a binary one. The transformation is similar to that generating the dual problem. The problem is added new variables, one for each constraint of the original problem. The domain of each such variable is the set of satisfying tuples of the corresponding constraint. The constraints of the new problem enforce the value of the original variables to be consistent with the values of the new variables. For example, if the new variables c, corresponding to the old constraint C(x,y) can assume values (1,2) and (2,0), two new constraints are added: the first one enforces x to take value 1 if c=(1,2) value 2 if c=(2,0), and vice versa. The second condition enforces a similar condition for variable y. The graph representing the result of this transformation is bipartite, as all constraints are between a new and an old variable. Moreover, the constraints are functional: for any given value of a new variable, only one value of the old variable may satisfy the constraint.

The Formidable-class ships were developments of earlier British battleships, featuring the same battery of four guns—albeit more powerful 40-calibre versions—and top speed of of the preceding , while adopting heavier armour protection. The ship was laid down in July 1898, was launched in March 1899, and was completed in July 1901. Commissioned in September 1901, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and served with the fleet until 1908. After a refit, she transferred to the Channel Fleet, then onto the Atlantic Fleet in May 1909. By now rendered obsolete by the emergence of the dreadnought class ships, she was assigned to the 5th Battle Squadron and attached to the Home Fleet in 1912. Upon the outbreak of World War I, Implacable, along with the squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet. After operations with the Dover Patrol, she served in the Dardanelles Campaign in support of the Allied landings at Gallipoli. She participated in the Landing at Cape Helles on 25–26 April and supported ANZAC forces ashore over the course of the following month. In late May 1915, she was withdrawn to reinforce the Italian fleet at the southern end of the Adriatic Sea after Italy joined the war on the side of the Allies. She remained in the Mediterranean until June 1917, apart from a brief return to Britain in March and April 1916 for a refit. After returning to England, she was laid up until March 1918, when she was converted for use as a depot ship for the Northern Patrol. After the war, she was decommissioned and eventually sold for scrap in 1921. Design Line-drawing of the Formidable class The design for the Formidable class was prepared in 1897; it was an incremental improvement over the preceding and es. Formidable adopted the larger size of the Majestics, while taking the stronger Krupp armour of the Canopus design. In addition, the new design incorporated longer (and thus more powerful) main and secondary guns and an improved hull form. These characteristics produced a ship with better armour protection than either earlier class, but with the same high speed of Canopus. Implacable was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She displaced normally and up to fully loaded. Her crew numbered 780 officers and ratings. The Formidable-class ships were powered by a pair of 3-cylinder triple-expansion engines that drove two screws, with steam provided by twenty Belleville boilers. The boilers were trunked into two funnels located amidships. The Formidable-class ships had a top speed of from . Implacable had a main battery of four 40-calibre guns mounted in twin-gun turrets fore and aft; these guns were mounted in circular barbettes that allowed all-around loading or elevation. The ships also mounted a secondary battery of twelve 45-calibre guns mounted in casemates, in addition to ten 12-pounder guns and six 3-pounder guns for defence against torpedo boats. As was customary for battleships of the period, she was also equipped with four torpedo tubes submerged in the hull. Implacable had an armoured belt that was thick; the transverse bulkheads on either end of the belt were thick. Her main battery turrets sides were thick, atop barbettes, and the casemate battery was protected with 6 in of Krupp steel. Her conning tower had thick sides as well. She was fitted with two armoured decks, thick, respectively. Service history =Pre-World War I= HMS Implacable was laid down at Devonport Dockyard on 13 July 1898 and launched on 11 March 1899 in a very incomplete state to clear the building way for construction of battleship . She was completed in July 1901. Implacable was commissioned at Devonport Dockyard by Captain Prince Louis of Battenberg on 10 September 1901 for service on the Mediterranean Station, and left Plymouth for the Mediterranean 29 September, arriving at Malta on 8 October 1901. The gun shields for her 3-pounder guns were removed the following year. In June 1902 she was in Alexandria for the scheduled coronation festivities for King Edward VII, and in September that year she visited Nauplia in the Aegean Sea for combined manoeuvres with the Mediterranean and Channel squadrons. Captain Reginald Charles Prothero was appointed in command on 27 October 1902, serving as such until May 1904. In November 1902 she was Genoa to land Prince Louis on his departure home, and the officers of the ship attended the deferred coronation ball organized by the British colony in the city. During her Mediterranean service, she underwent refits at Malta in 1902, 1903–1904, and 1904–1905. During these refits, she had her masts revised several times as rangefinders and fire control equipment were added. She suffered a fatal accident on 12 July 1905 when a boiler explosion killed two men, and suffered another boiler explosion on 16 August 1906, the result of a loss of feedwater that caused the boiler to overheat. She entered Chatham Dockyard in the United Kingdom in 1908 for another refit. During this refit, her 12-pounder guns were relocated from the main deck to the superstructure, and the four forward gun ports were plated over to reduce flooding in heavy seas. When her Chatham refit ended in February 1909, Implacable transferred to the Channel Fleet, then to the Atlantic Fleet on 15 May 1909. Following a fleet reorganisation on 1 May 1912, Implacable transferred to the 5th Battle Squadron in the Second Home Fleet at the Nore on 13 May 1912. =World War I= When World War I began in August 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was assigned to the Channel Fleet and based at Portland. Implacable and her half-sister were attached temporarily to the Dover Patrol in late October 1914 to bombard German Army forces along the coast of Belgium in support of Allied forces fighting at the front. The German forces were attacking French positions to the east of Dunkirk, and they were in dire need of heavy artillery support. A flotilla of destroyers and monitors helped to break up the attack before Implacable and Queen arrived, but reports of an imminent German counterattack with armoured cruisers, which ultimately failed to materialize, led the British to send the battleships to guard against it in company with the Harwich Force. When it had become clear that the German fleet posed no threat, they returned to the Channel Fleet. On 14 November 1914, the 5th Battle Squadron was transferred to Sheerness in case of a possible German invasion attempt, but it returned to Portland on 30 December 1914. In January 1915, the British and French navies began to draw ships to the eastern Mediterranean to begin operations against the Ottoman Empire, including several ships from the 5th Battle Squadron. By the end of the month, only Implacable, Queen, and their sisters and , along with the light cruisers and that had been assigned to support the 5th Squadron, were still at Portland. Dardanelles campaign Map showing landing beaches of the Gallipoli Campaign In March 1915, as the British and French fleets waging the Dardanelles campaign were preparing to launch a major attack on 18 March, the overall commander, Admiral Sackville Carden, requested two more battleships of the 5th Squadron, Implacable and Queen, to be transferred to his command in the expectation of losses in the coming operation. The Admiralty ordered the two ships to transfer to the Dardanelles, and they left England on 13 March 1915 and arrived at Lemnos on 23 March 1915. By the time they arrived, the British had lost two battleships in the 18 March attack, prompting the Admiralty to send the last two ships of the 5th Squadron to join the fleet. On her arrival off the Dardanelles, Implacable joined 1st Squadron, which included seven other battleships under the command of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss. Over the course of the next month, the British and French fleet began preparations for the landings at Cape Helles and at Anzac Cove, the beginning of the land portion of the Gallipoli Campaign. Late in the day on 23 April, the Allied forces began to move into position for the landing; troop transports made their way to the concentration point off Tenedos. Wemyss followed in the armoured cruiser , and Implacable and the battleship accompanied him. On the night of 24–25 April, soldiers transferred from the troopships to Implacable, Cornwallis, and Euryalus, which then steamed to their landing beaches under cover of darkness. Implacable arrived off X Beach, part of the landings at Cape Helles, and started sending men ashore at 04:00 under cover of her own bombardment of Ottoman defences. In the course of the bombardment, she fired twenty 12-inch shells and 368 rounds of 6-inch. In recognition of the critical support she had provided the troops as they attacked Ottoman positions, they named the landing site \\"Implacable Beach\\". Over the course of the following days, Implacable continued to bombard Ottoman positions around the landing beaches. As Ottoman forces began to gather at Krithia to launch a counterattack against Y Beach on 26 April, Implacable opened a heavy bombardment that completely dispersed the Ottomans. Two days later, she was again off X Beach, and she and several other British and French battleships bombarded Ottoman troop concentrations during the First Battle of Krithia. She helped to break up an Ottoman attack on Y Beach on the night of 1 May and supported an unsuccessful British and ANZAC attack on Krithia five days later, the Second Battle of Krithia. Later operations Implacable, along with the battleships London, Prince of Wales, and Queen, was detached from the Dardanelles on 22 May 1915 to become part of a new 2nd Detached Squadron in the Adriatic Sea to reinforce the Italian Navy after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Implacable arrived at Taranto, Italy, her base for this duty, on 27 May 1915. In November 1915, Implacable transferred to the 3rd Detached Squadron. Based at Salonika, this squadron was organised to reinforce the Suez Canal Patrol and assist the French Navy in blockading the Aegean coasts of Greece and Bulgaria. She shifted her base to Port Said, Egypt, later that month. Implacable departed on 22 March 1916 for a refit in the United Kingdom, arriving at Plymouth Dockyard on 9 April 1916. When her refit was complete, she returned to the 3rd Detached Squadron and was based at Salonika. In June 1917, Implacable was at Athens during the abdication of King Constantine I of Greece. In July 1917, Implacable returned to the United Kingdom and paid off at Portsmouth to provide crews for anti-submarine vessels, and four main-deck casemates on either side were replaced by two 6-inch guns on her battery deck. She was laid up until March 1918, when she was selected for service as a depot ship with the Northern Patrol at Lerwick, Kirkwall, and Buncrana. In the conversion, she kept her main battery and the four upper-deck 6-inch guns, but the rest of her 6-inch guns were removed, as were her anti-torpedo nets. In November 1918, Implacable was placed on the disposal list, paid off in 1919, and on 4 February 1920 was placed on the sale list. She was sold for scrapping to the Slough Trading Company on 8 November 1921. Resold to a German firm, she was towed to Germany for scrapping in April 1922.

Bernstein. It is similar to GNU Mailman and Majordomo but only works with the qmail mail transfer agent. It is released into the public domain. The latest version, 0.53, came out in 1997. The related program ezmlm-idx originated as an add-on to ezmlm. It now exists as a complete package on its own, but can still be considered essentially as an extension to ezmlm. It adds multi-message threaded message retrieval from the archive, digests, message and subscription moderation, and a number of remote administration functions. The latest version, 7.2.2, was released May 15, 2014.  Features  ezmlm provides all of the common electronic mailing list functionality: moderated lists, automated subscription and unsubscription, and digest creation. ezmlm takes advantage of the features of qmail to enable ordinary users to create and to manage mailing lists, without need for superuser privileges. Unlike some other mailing list management software, ezmlm's user interface is command-based. The mailing list administrator usually does not have to edit files. For example, the command to create a new mailing list is: and the commands to (manually) subscribe someone to and unsubscribe someone from that list are: and: The operation of each individual mailing list is controlled by files in the list's directory ( in the given example). That directory also contains an archive of all messages sent to the list. Whether a list is moderated or not is controlled by the existence of a file in the list's directory, named . In the given example, this file would be . If the file exists, the list is not moderated, and anyone can subscribe to and unsubscribe from the mailing list by sending (empty) electronic mail messages to special and electronic mailboxes. If the file does not exist, the list is moderated, and only the list owner can change subscriptions using the and commands. The ezmlm-idx extension provides more moderation mechanisms. Standard ezmlm does not include a web interface, but the ezmlm-web extension provides that functionality. Ezmlm works very fast since it makes use of database type files, while many other mailing list managers use flat ascii files. Ezmlm also has a very good security record.

Established in 1916, Hillcrest is affiliated with the Church of the Lutheran Brethren of America. Hillcrest's mission is \\"to equip students in a Christ-centered Bible-based environment for a life of eternal significance.\\" http://www.ffhillcrest.org/significant Hillcrest holds accreditation as a non- public high school through Cognia (formerly AdvancED) and the Minnesota Nonpublic School Accrediting Association (MNSAA). Campus Hillcrest occupies an historic building constructed in 1901 by the Norwegian Lutheran Synod to house the Park Region Luther College. The four-story red brick and sandstone building, located on a hilltop overlooking the city, is in the Romanesque Revival style and was designed by Twin Cities architects Omeyer and Thori, who also designed educational buildings at St. Olaf College, courthouses in Windom and Ada, and the E.J. Webber house and Ole Hagen's Autograph Block in Fergus Falls. Its construction, supervised by contractor John Lauritzen, required all of the brick masons available in the area. The building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.Park Region Luther College - 715 W. Vernon Ave., City of Fergus Falls website Park Region Luther College operated on the site until 1932, when the synod decided to concentrate its academic efforts on Concordia College in Moorhead. Three years later, the campus was sold to the Church of the Lutheran Brethren, which operates Hillcrest Academy. Hillcrest served as the high school department of Lutheran Brethren Schools from its founding until 2003, when it was incorporated as a separate school directly under the Church of the Lutheran Brethren, with its own president and school board. HLA continued to share the campus with Lutheran Brethren Seminary, the theological training institute of the Church of the Lutheran Brethren. That was until in 2015, the seminary building was given to Hillcrest, which was renovated to the new Student Union, and the seminary moved across the street to a new addition attached to The Church of the Lutheran Brethren synod offices. https://issuu.com/hillcrest/docs/hc_fall-winter_15-final_xerox Athletics Hillcrest won the Minnesota 9-Man State Football Title in 2001 under Head Coach Richard Risbrudt and participating at the state level in basketball and soccer as well.

Uniquely, Presley did not sing on-screen, and the film featured no songs at all except for the main title theme, which was played over the opening credits. It was also the only movie in which Presley wore a beard. The film was novelized by Harry Whittington.Bridges, Ben. \\"Harry Whittington.\\" www.benbridges.com.uk. Retrieved December 9, 2016. Ina Balin, Victor French, Barbara Werle, and Solomon Sturges co-starred. It was the final film for director Charles Marquis Warren who also produced and wrote it. It was also the only Presley film distributed by National General Pictures. The film made a profit but was not a runaway success, and remains one of Presley's least- seen films despite being regarded among his best in terms of a 'straight' (non-musical) acting performance. Plot Jess Wade (Elvis Presley), a former member of a gang of outlaws led by Vince Hackett (Victor French), is standing at a bar waiting on an old flame, Tracey Winters (Ina Balin). Vince's younger brother Billy Roy (Solomon Sturges) enters the saloon and spots Jess. Before a shoot-out ensues Jess orders the bar's patrons to leave. Jess then makes a break for the door but is stopped by Gunner (James Sikking) and forced to relinquish his gun. The gang take Jess with them to their hideout in the mountains. Vince shows Jess that the gang have stolen a gold-plated cannon that was used by Emperor Maximilian in his ill-fated fight against popular Mexican leader Benito Juárez. Vince intends to sell the gun for $100,000 to other gangs. In revenge for Jess deserting the gang, Vince informs him that he has been set-up and that the Federales believe he was behind the robbery. He shows off a wanted poster that identifies Jess. Vince explains that during the robbery another gang member called Norm was fatally wounded in the neck and that Vince has let it be known that it was Jess rather than Norm so that Jess would take the blame. Vince orders the gang to subdue Jess and using a hot poker he burns Jess on his neck. The gang beat Jess unconscious and then leave him with just his saddle before riding off. Jess manages to catch up with the gang later that night, Vince gives Jess some food but informs him that he's now a wanted man (being chased by the Mexican government as well as the US cavalry). Jess manages to track down a wild stallion, breaks it and saddles it. Jess makes his way to a local town where he greets Sheriff Dan Ramsey (James Almanzar). Dan explains that he's received a wanted poster and knows all about the robbery. Jess tells Dan he is innocent and goes into detail about Vince's plot which Dan believes. Jess leaves the Sheriff's office and sneaks into the local hotel where he finds his former lover Tracey Winters. The two embrace but then Tracey tells Jess she knows all about the theft of the cannon. Jess tries futilely to explain that Vince has set him up, Tracey gives him his pistol and holster and begs Jess to let Vince go. Tracey threatens Jess that if anything should happen, she'll expose him to the local town as a wanted man. Meanwhile, Billy Roy Hackett arrives into town and accosts Marcie (Lynn Kellogg), but she walks away from him. Billy Roy enters the saloon and starts to talk with the barman before Tracey intervenes. Jess seeing Billy Roy attempts to diffuse the situation. Sheriff Dan arrives after being summoned by Marcie. Billy Roy pretends to acquiesce to Jess and Dan's request for him to leave but takes Tracey at gunpoint. He then shoots Dan but Jess knocks him unconscious and drags him out of the saloon. Jess ensures Dan is looked after by the town doctor and barber Opie (Paul Brinegar) and ensures Billy Roy is safely jailed. Dan swears Jess in as his deputy and asks that he keep the town safe, while he recuperates. Jess returns to the jail where the townspeople are threatening to lynch Billy Roy. To defuse things, Jess knocks Billy Roy out and then arms the men and instructs them to defend their stores. When challenged Jess shows the men he has been deputised by Dan and they grudgingly acquiesce to his instructions. At the gangs camp, Vince awakes to find that Billy Roy has snuck off from the town. He beats several gang members for letting Billy Roy sneak away before heading to town. Meanwhile, Jess checks in on Dan and Opie tells him that Dan will recover. Tracey angrily approaches Jess and tells him he should have men on lookout for the gang, Jess agrees it's a good plan and Tracey storms off. As she walks across the street with Marcie, she spots that Jess already has every man on their roofs defending their property in advance of the gangs arrival. Vince arrives into the town and heads for the saloon inquiring after Billy Roy. Tracey informs Vince that Billy Roy has been jailed for shooting Dan and there are multiple witnesses. Vince leaves the saloon and heads for the jail where he demands the release of Billy Roy. Jess counters that Vince should return the cannon and clear his name. Vince issues an ultimatum that if Jess doesn't release Billy Roy before sundown he'll unleash the cannon against the town. Jess brings Vince out onto the main street where he shows him the armed townspeople. Vince glances at his watch as he shows he's called the Mexican cavalry in. He then threatens to expose Jess to the Mexican Lieutenant Rivera (Tony Young). Jess in turn threatens to shoot Billy Roy and Vince backs down agreeing to get rid of the cavalry. He approaches Lt Rivera and promises to bring them to the cannon in exchange for a $10,000 reward. Jess goes to Dan with Vince's proposal. The wounded Sheriff denies Jess' request to free Billy Roy. Jess agrees to not release Billy Roy. Dan's wife Sara (Barbara Werle) chases after Jess and pleads with Jess not to heed Dan's instruction and let Billy Roy go. Jess explains to Sara that he gave Dan his word and cannot break it. Meanwhile, outside the town, the gang create an ambush for Lt Rivera and his men. They train the cannon on the troop as they cross at the river. Vince crosses first and just as Lt Rivera and his men enter the river the gang fire the cannon. Lt Rivera's men are massacred but he survives, as he goes to confront Vince, Vince coldly guns him down. Vince informs the gang that they are to bring the cannon to the town so they can force Jess to release Billy Roy. When one of the gang stands up to Vince and calls the plan crazy, Vince guns him down and the gang quickly comply. Billy Roy in the jail starts to mock Jess from his cell as Vince arrives back into town. Vince demands his brother's release while Jess tries to antagonise him into a shoot-out. Just then the gang begin a bombardment with the cannon destroying the church. Sara screams as another explosion destroys their house and runs in to find Dan dead. She rushes back blaming Jess for Dan's death and grabs the wanted notice exposing Jess in front of the entire town. The town start to turn on Jess demanding for him to release Billy Roy. Jess explains to them that once Billy Roy is released Vince cannot let anyone else live as they can expose him as the real thief. Vince rides out and the townsfolk demand Billy Roy be released. Tracey approaches Jess and tells Jess she can see he has changed and they embrace. He asks her to get somewhere safe. Jess grabs Billy Roy as the townsfolk led by Sara break into the jail. Sara accuses Jess as working against the town and being in with the gang all along. As the cannon goes off again Tracey announces to the town that Jess is still on their side. She attempts to rally the town behind Jess. As the gang are about to start the final bombardment Jess sets a trap for the gang. He ties Billy Roy to a tree and has him call-out to the gang. The gang attempt to sneak up on Jess and when that fails they try and shoot Jess with the cannon. In the shoot out the cannon falls off the wagon and rolls against the tree crushing Billy Roy. Jess picks off the remaining gang members and captures a distraught Vince. He informs him that he intends to take Vince and the cannon back to Mexico. In the final scene in the town Sara is shown to forgive Jess. Opie and the townsfolk gather and thank Jess for his actions. Tracey runs after Jess who informs her that while he doesn't intend to return to the town, he'll send for her.

The budget for the movie was estimated at $1.5 million. Working titles for the film included Jack Valentine, Johnny Hang, and Come Hell or Come Sundown. Presley signed up to the project with high hopes after reading the serious, song-free script, but was left disappointed when he arrived for his first day of shooting on July 22, 1968 to find that the script he had originally signed up for had been changed beyond recognition. The original opening scene, which was to feature female nudity, was dropped in favor of a more gentle bar scene. The story of Charro, which was written by Frederick Louis Fox, contained many violent scenes that were dropped from the film altogether. Harry Whittington based his novelization Charro on Fox's story, and included the scenes that Warren deemed too violent for the film.De Jong, Gerrit. \\"Original Books Adapted Into Elvis Presley’s Movies.\\" www.elvisechoesofthepast.com. Retrieved December 9, 2016. A scene which featured Ina Balin nude climbing from a bath was also removed. Location scenes were shot at Apache Junction and the Apacheland Movie Ranch in Arizona. Reception The film, although a hit, was not received as well as Presley's previous films. Fans were put off by the lack of songs, and critics were generally unimpressed with the film as a whole. Despite this, the film made a good profit and Presley received $850,000 for his work. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times wrote of Presley's performance, \\"He treats his part rather as a minor embarrassment, and he seems determined not to push himself in a role that could have used a stronger personality to fill the lapses in the story and the wide open spaces in the dialogue.\\"Greenspun, Roger (September 4, 1969). \\"'A Fine Pair' and 'Charro' on Double Bill in Neighborhoods\\".

Allan Eyles of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"Unfortunately, Charro is fatally undermined by the slack staging of its action highlights and by a plot riddled with irrational behaviour and dialogue ... As if to compensate for the film's lack of impact, Hugo Montenegro's lively but over-attentive score does too much underlining of mood and character.\\" Soundtrack In June 1968, Presley had already completed the sequences and recorded the songs for what would be his comeback television special and its attendant album, Elvis, that put his musical talents back on display after the long slog of the soundtrack years.Jorgensen, Ernst. Elvis Presley A Life in Music: The Complete Recording Sessions. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998; pp. 255-259. During the special, Presley erroneously states that he had made twenty nine '\\"pictures\\" up to that time. The actual tally was twenty eight at taping. Charro would be the twenty ninth. At the time the special was aired in December, Presley had completed his thirtieth film, The Trouble with Girls (and How to Get into It). His confidence and enthusiasm restored, Presley turned to his musical obligations for Charro! Appropriately for a Western, the studio hired Hugo Montenegro to produce the film's two songs, the recording session taking place at Samuel Goldwyn Studio in Hollywood, California on October 15, 1968.Jorgensen, op. cit., p. 260. The title song appeared in the movie during the opening credits, released commercially on February 25, 1969, as the b-side to RCA 47-9731 \\"Memories,\\" which had also appeared on the TV special and album.Jorgensen, op. cit., p. 249. A second song recorded for but not used in the film, \\"Let's Forget About the Stars\\" appeared on the budget album Let's Be Friends in 1970. This song is erroneously referred to in some sources as an outtake from the soundtrack of the later Presley film Change of Habit.Roy Carr and Mick Farren, Elvis: The Illustrated Record.

It marked the very first time that an uncut release of the film was presented to the retail market, and in its original wide-screen letterbox format. This DVD version underwent an extensive re-mastering process to restore the original 35mm film-print quality. Previous VHS issues of the film, notably the 1990 Warner Home Video release, were of an inferior standard, mainly due to poor picture quality and minor edits throughout the movie. An oddity concerning Charro! is the film's classification. Despite containing violence and partial nudity (the latter a scene in which Ina Balin's character is shown exiting a bath tub), it was released with an MPAA G rating, even though other Presley films from the 1968-69 period carry PG ratings. These latter releases are somewhat less 'adult' than Charro!.

The ranch includes the Ewing Mansion, which was the setting for both Dallas television series: the original, which first aired on CBS from 1978 to 1991 (except for the first five episodes which were at Cloyce Box Ranch), and its continuation, first aired on TNT from 2012 to 2014. History The house was built in 1970 by Joe Duncan and was known as Duncan Acres, named after his family. The property was originally in size. The \\"mansion\\" at Southfork Ranch is a house with a enclosed garage that was turned into a den/card room. The ranch appears in the television series Dallas. Exterior shots were filmed on location from 1979 until 1989, though Lorimar Productions also made a studio mock-up of the ranch's exterior (complete with swimming pool) in California in 1979 for use when the weather made it impractical to film on location in Texas. From 1989 the series' production shifted entirely to the California studio set. The reunion movies J.R. Returns (1996) and War of the Ewings (1998) returned to the ranch, as did the non-fiction special The Return to Southfork (2004). War of the Ewings, in 1998, was the only time filming was done inside the real ranch for dramatic purposes. Southfork was again used for the new Dallas series. In 1993–94 the ranch was featured in the Little Texas music video \\"God Blessed Texas\\". The ranch is now an event and conference center, owned by Forever Resorts. It was home to the KLTY-FM radio Christian concert Celebrate Freedom, held annually during the Independence Day celebration, and hosted the 4 July 2009 \\"America's Tea Party\\", which an organizer said drew an estimated crowd of 25,000–35,000.\\"More than 25,000 attend Southfork Ranch tea party, organizer says,\\" Dallas Morning News, July 5, 2009.

Folk names include wart spurge, umbrella milkweed and madwoman's milk.Malta Wild Plants Euphorbia helioscopia  Description  It is an annual plant growing in arable land and disturbed ground. It grows to 10–50 cm tall, with a single, erect, hairless stem, branching toward the top. The leaves are oval, broadest near the tip, 1.5–3 cm long, with a finely toothed margin. The flowers are small, yellow-green, with two to five basal bracts similar to the leaves but yellower; flowering lasts from mid-spring to late summer.  Uses  It is highly poisonous. Active ingredients are extracted from it for use in pharmaceutical industry. It is also a plant used in Chinese traditional medicine. Its extract has been found to inhibit hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo in mice and in vitro in human cells.  Chemistry  Euphorbia helioscopia contains the jatrophone-type diterpenoids euphoheliosnoid A, B, C and D and other toxic diterpenes such as euphoscopins, epieuphoscopins euphornins, cuphohelioscopins and euphohelionone.

In a cyclical process, a sequence of events repeats itself on a regular basis. Michel Aglietta views economic reproduction as the process whereby the initial conditions necessary for economic activity to occur are constantly re-created.Michel Aglietta, A theory of capitalist regulation. London: NLB, 1979 (expanded edition, 2015). Marx viewed reproduction as the process by which society re-created itself, both materially and socially. Economic reproduction involves: *the physical production and distribution of goods and services, *the trade (the circulation via exchanges and transactions) of goods and services, *the consumption of goods and services (both productive or intermediate consumption and final consumption). *the reproduction of voluntary and involuntary social relations, involving competition and cooperation (including the social relations of the class hierarchy). Karl Marx developed the original insights of Quesnay to model the circulation of capital, money, and commodities in the second volume of Das Kapital to show how the reproduction process that must occur in any type of society can take place in capitalist society by means of the circulation of capital.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II. Penguin Classics, 1992. Marx distinguishes between \\"simple reproduction\\" and \\"expanded (or enlarged) reproduction\\".Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I. Penguin Classics, 1990, chapter 23 and Capital, Volume II. Penguin Classics, 1992, chapter 20 and 21. In the former case, no economic growth occurs, while in the latter case, more is produced than is needed to maintain the economy at the given level, making economic growth possible. In the capitalist mode of production, the difference is that in the former case, the new surplus value created by wage-labour is spent by the employer on consumption (or hoarded), whereas in the latter case, part of it is reinvested in production. Ernest Mandel additionally refers in his two-volume Marxist Economic Theory to contracted reproduction, meaning production on a smaller and smaller scale, in which case business operating at a loss outnumbers growing business (e.g., in wars, depressions, or disasters).Ernest Mandel, Marxist Economic Theory, Volume 1. London: Merlin, 1968, chapter 10: \\"Reproduction and growth of the national income\\", p. 331. See also Joseph Tainter et al., The Collapse of Complex Societies. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990. Reproduction in this case continues to occur, but investment, employment, and output fall absolutely, so that the national income falls. In the Great Depression of the 1930s, for example, about one-quarter of the workers became unemployed; as a result of the 2008–9 slump, the unemployed labour force increased by about 30 million workers (a number approximately equal to the total workforce of France, or Britain).According to the International Labour Organization. Theoretical approach As an approach to studying economic activity, economic reproduction contrasts with equilibrium economics, because economic reproduction is concerned not with statics or with how economic development gravitates towards an equilibrium, but rather with dynamics—that is, the motion of an economy. It is not concerned with the conditions of a perfect match between supply and demand under ideal conditions but rather with the quantitative proportions between different economic activities or sectors that are necessary in any real economy so that economic activity can continue and grow. It is concerned with all the conditions for that, including the social and technical conditions necessary for the economic process. Reproduction economics does not assume that society is kept in balance by market mechanisms. Wassily Leontief developed Marx's idea further in his input-output economics (see also input- output model).W. Leontief, “Quantitative Input and Output Relations in the Economic System of the United States”. In: Review of Economics and Statistics Vol. 18, 1936, pp. 105-125; “Interrelation of Prices, Output, Savings and Investment”. In: Review of Economics and Statistics, Vol. 18, 1937, pp. 109-132 respectively; \\"The significance of Marxian economics for present-day economic theory\\". The American Economic Review, Vol. 28, No. 1, March 1938. However, there is a major difference between Leontief and Marx. By treating gross profit as a \\"factor input\\" as well as a factor output, the respective total values of the input and output in Leontief's model are always exactly equal. In Marx's model, the output in an accounting period is normally always higher in value than the input. This is what Marx believed capitalists to be in business for: to produce a product sold at a higher value than the sum of input costs, thus generating profit. The profit in Marx's theory is not an \\"input\\" (it is not part of the capital advanced), but a business result, the yield of capital on an investment. In Marx's view, economic reproduction in any society has five main features: *the production of reproducible products (goods or services) replacing, maintaining, or adding to the stock of society's physical assets *the physical maintenance of the (working) population and their dependents through household consumptionFor more detail, William James Booth, Households: on the moral architecture of the economy. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2003. *the reproduction and growth of the total population, including procreation and childrearingFor more detail, see Bonnie Fox, Hidden in the Household: Women's Domestic Labour Under Capitalism. Women's Press, 1980. *the reproduction, enforcement, and maintenance of social relations, in particular the relations of production that characterize the social hierarchy, and property rightsKarl Marx, Capital, Volume I. Penguin Classics, 1990, chapter 23. *the maintenance and reproduction of trading and distribution relations (the systems, institutions, and organizations enabling market trade and non-market allocation of resources) What is specific to capitalist society is that these reproduction processes are accomplished primarily via the intermediary of commercial trade; that is, they are mediated by the market. Reproduction on a larger and larger scale becomes conditional on successfully making money. It means that these processes tend to be increasingly reorganized to bring them in line with the requirements of the accumulation of capital. Marx's argument is that by producing an output value the equivalent to their own labor cost plus a surplus value (or gross profit) appropriated by capitalists, waged workers accomplish many of the processes involved at the same time. Part of the role of the state is to secure those general (collective) conditions for the reproduction and maintenance of society that individuals and private enterprise cannot secure by themselves for one reason or another (e.g., because they transcend competing interests, because they are too costly for private agencies, because it is technically not possible to privatize them, or because they are not sufficiently profitable or too risky).Bob Jessop, The Capitalist State: Marxist Theories and Methods. Oxford: Blackwell, 1982; Jessop, State Theory: Putting the Capitalist State in Its Place. Cambridge: Polity, 1990; Jessop, The Future of the Capitalist State. Cambridge: Polity 2002. Ecologists would nowadays probably add as a \\"reproduction condition\\" good stewardship for the physical environment.Harry Rothman, Murderous providence; a study of pollution in industrial societies. London: R. Hart- Davis, 1972. Sustainable development cannot occur if the natural environment is constantly depleted without being restored. The recycling of wastes and waste materials can be considered as a necessary and integral part of society's reproduction process. Each of these six features is the subject of much political controversy in society. Many different opinions exist about their relative importance and their effects on each other. Economists and businesspeople are often primarily concerned with the economic effects, but other intellectuals and workers are often more concerned with the non-economic effects for the health, security, and well-being of citizens. Thus, governments usually have both economic policies and social policies, population policies, environmental policies, and so on. Economic reproduction in capitalism According to Marx, in a capitalist society, economic reproduction is conditional on capital accumulation.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I. Penguin Classics, 1990, chapter 25 and Capital, Volume II. Penguin Classics, 1992, chapter 21. If workers fail to produce more capital, economic reproduction begins to break down. Therefore, economic reproduction in capitalist society is necessarily expanded reproduction and requires market growth. Capital must grow, otherwise the whole process breaks down. Thus, economic growth is not simply desirable but also necessary in capitalism, not just because of population growth, but for commercial reasons.Karl Marx, Capital, Volume I. Penguin Classics, 1990, chapter 25. In this light, the ecological vision of a \\"zero-growth society\\" appears rather utopian; or, at the very least, its achievement would require the abolition of capitalism. Some would argue that population growth makes economic growth absolutely necessary. Others argue that population growth must be restricted with birth control methods because otherwise there will be too many people for the available resources. The real argument, though, is not about growth or the lack thereof, but rather about the kind of growth that is best for the (enlarged) reproduction of the human species as such. Ecologists may validly argue that some types of growth undermine important conditions for human survival in the longer term without invalidating other kinds of growth that are beneficial. However, there is much dispute about which kinds of economic growth are beneficial or harmful. Capital accumulation (the amassing of wealth in the form of capital assets) can occur either by producing a net addition to the stock of capital assets or by transferring wealth from one owner to another. In the former case, the total stock of capital grows. In the latter case, the accumulation of one owner occurs at the expense of the other, there is no net growth. These two ways are usually combined, meaning that all or most owners make gains, but in unequal amounts. In considering the economic reproduction process as a whole, one therefore has to consider both the production of new resources and the transfer (distribution) of resources. As a corollary, supposing that there is no net growth of output and capital, capital accumulation can continue only if some people and organizations get richer while other people and organizations get poorer. Typically, if output growth slows down, socio-economic inequality (as measured, e.g., by the Gini coefficient) increases. Nine factors not theorized by Marx There were nine main factors that Marx disregarded in his construction of reproduction schemes when he modelled the circulation of capital (through the constant transformations of money-capital into production-capital and commodity-capital and vice versa). These omissions have been noted by various Marxist and non- Marxist authors. :*The sphere of consumption. Marx did not go into detail about how capitalist business reshapes, reorganizes, and restructures the mode of consumption so that it becomes more profitable. He concerned himself primarily with the capitalist mode of production, not with the capitalist mode of consumption.Ben Fine, The world of consumption. The material and cultural revisited, 2nd edition. London: Routledge, 2002, p. 60. :*Unproductive accumulation. Through successive cycles of economic reproduction, more and more capital assets are created that exist outside the sphere of capitalist production. These capital assets include residential housing; improved and unimproved land; publicly owned physical assets including offices, hospitals, schools, roads, installations, parks, vehicles, equipment, and infrastructural works; consumer durables; and all kinds of financial assets.See capital asset data in National Income & Product Accounts, Budget of the US Government, and McKinsey Quarterly \\"Survey of Capital Markets\\". These assets can also yield profits, income gains, or capital gains insofar as they are tradeable goods or rented out. For example, there is nowadays a large trade in used cars, second- hand equipment, and housing, as well as in financial assets. In fact, in developed capitalist countries, the capital directly tied up in private-sector means of production (i.e., the productive investment capital of private enterprises) is nowadays only the minor part of the total physical capital assets of society (i.e., a quarter or one-fifth); if financial assets are included, the proportion of this part shrinks even more (to one-sixth to one- eighth of the total capital).As shown by capital asset data, national wealth data, and household wealth data. :*Human capital and labour markets. Marx did not analyze the effects of human capital—that is, the skills and knowledge lodged in the physical bodies of workers, and the very large sums of money invested into education systems.Samuel Bowles & Herbert Gintis, \\"The problem with human capital theory - a Marxian critique.\\" The American Economic review, Vol. 65, Issue 2, May 1975, pp. 74-82. He was aware of the idea of human capital, but he regarded it as a fictitious, reified notion that, he argued, would imply that workers were really capitalists.\\"Apologetic economists present the matter wrongly... They say that the same money here realizes two capitals : the buyer - the capitalist - converts his money capital into living labour-power, which he incorporates into his productive capital ; on the other hand, the seller - the worker - converts his commodity -labour-power - into money that he spends as revenue, which is precisely what enables him to sell his labour-power over and over again and thus to maintain himself; his labour- power is thus actually his capital in the commodity form, from which he constantly draws his revenue. In point of fact, labour-power is his capacity (ever renewing and reproducing itself), not his capital. It is the only commodity that he can constantly sell, and he has to sell it in order to live, but it operates as capital (variable capital) only in the hands of the buyer, the capitalist. If a man is perpetually forced to sell his labour-power over and over again, i.e. to sell himself, to someone else, this proves, according to these economists, that he is a capitalist, because he always has a 'commodity ' (himself) for sale. In this sense even a slave would be a capitalist, even though he is sold once and for all as a commodity by a third person ; for the nature of this commodity, the working slave, not only requires that its buyer put it to work each day, but also that he give it the means of subsistence that it needs in order to be able to work again.\\" - Karl Marx, Capital, Volume II, Penguin ed., chapter 20 section 10, pp. 515-516. Nevertheless, the stock of skills and knowledge in the economy can represent a very large tradable value, which can profoundly influence economic relationships, insofar as workers can increase their income because they possess specialized skills and knowledge. Considerable money is spent on education and research and development in developed capitalist countries. Marx intended to write a separate study about the labour market, considering the different forms that wages could take, but he never did.Capital, Volume I, Penguin edition, p. 683. :*Rent seeking. Marx did not analyze the effects of \\"rent-seeking\\" for economic reproduction.Mushtaq Husain Khan & Jomo Kwame Sundaram, Rents, rent-seeking and economic development: theory and evidence in Asia. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. In conventional economics, the term \\"rent-seeking\\" was coined in 1974, and refers mainly to a form of parasitism or economic opportunism by government bureaucrats in a privileged position (though sometimes it is applied to firms and business managers).Charles K. Rowley et al., The political economy of rent-seeking. Boston: Kluwer, 1988. Definitions of \\"economic rent\\" are much disputed in economic theory, but in radical theory they refer to an unearned income (which may be conceptualized as being not a true \\"factor-income\\" but rather an income in excess of factor-income) that derives from a favorable trading position or from the monopolization of a resource.Michael Hudson, \\"Financial Capitalism v. Industrial Capitalism\\". Contribution to The Other Canon Conference on Production Capitalism vs. Financial Capitalism, Oslo, September 3–4, 1998. Marx only considered the special case of land rent (\\"ground rent\\"), but modern theorists argue that the scope of economic rents has become much larger. If investors can earn rents simply by capitalizing on the ownership or use of a resource (and make money simply by trading in the ownership of assets, which may themselves be borrowed assets), then, if this sort of activity makes more profit faster, with less risk and lower tax than investing in production, capital will shift more and more to trade in already existing assets. If there exist plenty of such assets, a very large trade in such assets can develop, causing speculative bubbles. The result is that output growth is curbed and may even turn negative.Jan Toporowski, The end of finance. London: Routledge, 2000. Thus, the relative proportions of industry profits, interest, and rent income in total surplus value have a decisive effect on the ability of the economy to grow. The more the interest and rent that must be paid for production to occur, the more this becomes a constraint for expanding production. If the population increases, output, investments, and jobs necessarily have to grow to keep up with it; but in a complex system of financial intermediation involving rent seeking, economic growth may fail to occur on a sufficient scale, and in that case, some groups can only improve their economic position at the expense of others. This argument, however, is also disputed by many theorists; the objection is simply that well-developed capital and money markets ensure that the finance exists to develop production, and that without a strong financial sector, production would be starved of funds.McKinsey Quarterly, various issues. :*Non-capitalist economic areas. In his theory of capital, Marx failed to consider the importance and weight of the non-capitalist production activities that must occur to sustain capitalist production (a significant component of which is household labour; see below). He was primarily concerned to show that the reproduction of society as a whole could in principle be accomplished by means of the accumulation of capital. All the activities of economic production can, Marx argued, in principle be organized in a capitalist way (according to commercial logic). It supplied proof that the capitalist mode of production could exist as an historically distinctive world system, completely dominated by the requirements of capital, without quickly breaking down. But this idea was strongly criticized, especially by German Marxist authors such as Rosa Luxemburg and Fritz Sternberg.Rosa Luxemburg, The accumulation of Capital. New York: Monthly Review Press, 1968; Fritz Sternberg, Der Imperialismus. Berlin 1926 and Der Imperialismus und seine KritikerBerlin 1929. (not translated into English). They argued that capital accumulation proceeds only by constantly drawing upon a non-capitalist \\"hinterland\\" or region. That is, markets can expand only if there are new, non-capitalist areas to expand into; but inversely, these non-capitalist areas could actually support the capitalist economy well in advance of becoming thoroughly organized according to commercial principles. This idea is developed further by the Marxist David Harvey, who uses the concept of accumulation by dispossession.David Harvey, The New Imperialism. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. Lewis in his Nobel prize winning Theory of Economic Growth and model of economic development argued the opposite – that the capitalist sector raises wages, drawing unproductive labour out of the non-capitalist sector, creating a self- sustaining process of economic development. :*Population growth. Marx failed to systematically theorize the impact of demographic effects on economic reproduction, except that he studied the reserve army of labour and criticized the \\"overpopulation\\" theories of Thomas Malthus. Malthus was anxious that population growth would outstrip the capacity of the economy to sustain all the new people. Marx replied that the very idea of \\"overpopulation\\" was an anti-human ideological fiction, since it really meant \\"overpopulation\\" only relative to the requirements of capital accumulation. If resources were appropriately allocated, there was enough for everybody to have a decent life. The real point was that capital could not achieve that goal. Capital accumulation necessitated a \\"relative surplus population\\", which tended to grow in size. Nevertheless, since population trends are not simply determined by economic factors, population movements can exert an important independent effect on economic reproduction. In China population growth has been curbed by deliberate government policy to restrict the number of births per couple, using birth control methods. Another aspect about which there is much controversy is the emigration of workers and refugee populations, whether they are an asset for, or a drain on, economic growth. Capitalists are generally in favor of the free international movement of capital, but they are much more cautious about freedom of movement for workers, depending on whether that movement is profitable to them or whether it is a cost or a political threat. :*Public finance. Marx did not analyze in any detail the effect of taxation and state expenditures on the reproduction process. In his time, state taxes and expenditures were comparatively small (5%–10% of gross product), but since that time they have risen to 30%–40% or more of gross product in many countries.Vito Tanzi and Ludger Schuknecht, Government spending in the 20th century. A global perspective. Cambridge University Press, 2000. They enable the state to intervene directly in the process of social and economic reproduction, and to alter its course within certain limits. Because of the size of state funds and the fact that taxes must be paid irrespective of productive performance, the state can borrow large sums and use them, together with legislation, to influence economic growth and social relations. In addition, the state nowadays also employs a very large number of people earning incomes from activity that is often or mostly not oriented to profit making, analogous to a non-profit sector sustained by subsidies, grants, and donations, as well as some income-generating activity. The state is the largest sponsor and purchaser of the military industry supplying the armed forces.Peter Custers, Questioning Globalized Militarism: Nuclear and Military Production and Critical Economic Theory. London: Merlin Press, 2008. :*Ecology. Although he did refer to it, Marx did not analyze in detail the depletion of natural resources by capitalist production, where the depletion involves non-reproducible goods, or living organisms that are wiped out. If land is exhausted or becomes infertile, or if it is devastated by a natural disaster, or if the yield of mines, forests, and fisheries becomes too low, production can no longer continue. After a series of cycles of capitalist reproduction, environments may emerge that are no longer inhabitable by human beings because they are incapable any longer of sustaining life. :*International division of labor. Through mechanization and productivity increases achieved by capitalist production, the allocation of human labour between agriculture, manufacturing industries, and services (the so-called primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors of the economy) is altered nationally and internationally. In developed capitalist countries, the agricultural labour force has shrunk to only a tiny fraction of the total workforce, and manufacturing industries remain only as a minor part of total production; the large majority of workers are employed in service industries. This contrasts with less-developed countries, which retain a large agricultural workforce, and newly industrializing countries, which feature a large manufacturing workforce. Marx did not analyze the implications of these long-term effects of the expansion of production by means of capital accumulation. In assessing the effect of these \\"omissions\\", one ought to keep in mind that when Marx discussed the intertwining of the circulation of capital with the reproduction processes that occur in any kind of society, he was primarily concerned with the functional requirements of the capitalist mode of production and not with the reproduction of the whole of society. At any time, a fraction of the population is not working or \\"economically active\\" (children, students, the sick and disabled, the unemployed, volunteer workers, housewives, pensioners, idlers, etc.), and assets are maintained or accumulated that are unrelated to the sphere of production. These were generally outside the scope of Marx's analysis, even if he occasionally mentioned them. Economic reproduction, economic equilibrium, and economic crises Marx's models of economic reproduction in capitalism have often been interpreted as stating the conditions for economic equilibrium, or balanced economic growth. After all, there are certain \\"necessary proportions\\" between different branches of production, which have to adjust their output levels to each other. If those proportions do not reach a minimum acceptable level, then products remain unsold or producers cannot obtain the inputs they require, in which case production begins to slow down or break down. So there are necessary proportions between production, distribution, and consumption that must be maintained if society is to survive and grow. In this sense, Marx distinguishes between the production of means of production, consumer goods, and luxury goods, and he considers the commercial interactions between the sectors producing them. If the growth of different sectors of production occurs very unevenly, bottlenecks can occur, so that a supply or demand cannot be met. In the worst case, an interruption in the normal reproduction process triggers a sequence of disturbances, a chain reaction, which spreads from some branches of production to the whole economy, meaning that products are left unsold and that producers receive insufficient income to pay their bills. The result is rising unemployment, idle productive capacity, and a drop in output and productive investment. This in turn means lower economic growth. *Disproportionality theories. This idea was the basis for numerous Marxist crisis theories devised in the first three decades of the 20th century, most famously by Rudolf Hilferding, Rosa Luxemburg, Nikolai Bukharin, Otto Bauer, and Henryk Grossmann. The argument is that balanced economic growth is only a temporary phenomenon, because a private enterprise economy is incapable of sustaining the necessary proportionalities required. It cannot do so because there is no overall, conscious coordination of production activities in an economic system in which producers compete to cut costs, increase sales, and increase profits. There has been much dispute about which disproportionalities exactly are of decisive importance and why those specific disproportionalities would occur and recur, but all these theorists agree that some disproportionalities must necessarily occur, making recurrent crises inevitable. *Uneven development theories. Other theorists such as Ernest Mandel and Roman Rosdolsky argued that capitalist economic development is always an \\"imbalanced\\" rather than \\"balanced\\" development in space and time. At most, an approximate balance of supply and demand is achieved in particular areas. In that case, an economic equilibrium never exists in reality; it is only a theoretical abstraction. There are constant market fluctuations as producers adjust to each other without being able to determine how much others will produce for sale. At most, one could say that in times of strong economic growth, when markets strongly expand, all producers can make gains from increasing output, even if the gains are unequal. But after a certain time, productive investment will \\"overshoot\\" a now saturated market demand, causing the economy to spiral into crisis again. :The basis for this alternative interpretation is that as long as simple reproduction is at least accomplished, expanded reproduction permits considerable variations, possibilities, and flexibilities (elasticities); the gross profit income of enterprises can, within certain limits, be used or reinvested in many different ways without causing any critical disturbance of the economic reproduction process as a whole. The higher labor productivity is and the larger the surplus product, the more discretionary wealth exists. The less that basic necessities (food, clothing, housing, cellphones, etc.) cost as a fraction of the disposable household budget, the more funds are available to be spent optionally or saved. In addition, the extension of credit can compensate for temporary supply-demand imbalances. So while certain minimal quantitative conditions do exist for the proportionalities of outputs among different branches of production, these proportionalities can be maintained, even if the output growth rate per year drops, say from 4% to 2%. Provided that the capitalist relations of production are stable and secure, capital accumulation will continue, despite constant market fluctuations, at a slower or faster pace. Society will reproduce itself anyway, but at a lower or higher standard of living. In this case, models of economic reproduction are not a useful guide to understanding economic crises because, it is argued, Marx only intended them to show how it was possible for the whole economic reproduction process to be accomplished on the basis of the circulation of capital, by stating the minimum requirements (not the equilibrium conditions) for it. If certain quantitative assumptions are made about the growth rates of different sectors and about capital compositions, it can be proved that certain disproportions must necessarily develop. But in reality, the economic reproduction process could be interrupted or break down for all kinds of reasons (including non-economic causes, such as wars or disasters). And if disproportions occur, the economic system can also adjust to them, within certain limits. If vastly more capital assets are created than are invested in production, one cannot explain economic crises simply in terms of disproportionalities in the sphere of production; one has to look at the process of capital accumulation as a whole, which includes the financial system, non-productive assets, and real estate. This becomes particularly important when large debt crises occur. These debt crises signal that serious misallocations of capital have occurred, which impact negatively on economic reproduction. *Financialization theories. A third, more recent interpretation is that the reproduction process (both the material reproduction processes and the reproduction of capital) has become completely dominated by capital finance.Jan Toporowski, The End of Finance: Capital Market Inflation, Financial Derivatives and Pension Fund Capitalism. Routledge, 2002. Hence, to explain economic crises, critical disproportions between the developments of branches of production, or unutilized capacity ought to be viewed as emerging out of specific financial and monetary regimes pursued by financial institutions and the state. The large funds commanded by these organizations are thought to shape the whole character of the reproduction process.Michael Hudson, \\"From Marx to Goldman Sachs: The Fictions of Fictitious Capital, and the Financialization of Industry\\". Critique. A journal of socialist theory, Vol. 38, No. 3, August 2010, pp. 419-444. As analysts like Michael Hudson like to point out, ordinary consumers in developed countries today have little in common anymore with how economists portray them in their models, because in reality consumers are using the majority of what they earn to pay interest, premiums, rent and debt principal to the financial industry (finance, insurance and real estate). Consumers spend less than a quarter or less than 20% of their earnings on actual goods and services. Just as Marx noted a progression from natural economy to a \\"money-economy\\" and then a \\"credit economy\\", it is argued that the reproduction process has now become dominated by the supply, demand, or withdrawal of credit-money. However, there is much theoretical controversy about exactly how the relationship between the \\"real economy\\" (the direct involvement with the production and consumption of goods and services) and the \\"financial economy\\" (the circuit of trade in financial claims) should be understood. There is not much consensus about the effects of different financial policies by government and business on the economy, or how one could prove what the effects are. Arguably, much of the confusion in the debates about economic reproduction is attributable to two basic errors: *Definition of capitalism. Scholars often confuse Marx's idea about what is required for the reproduction of the capitalist mode of production (bringing together the factors of production to make money) with what is required for the reproduction of capitalist society as a whole. Abstractly, it is assumed that the economy consists only of capitalist production and that the capitalist economy is equal to capitalist society. But in reality this is not the case. Capitalist society contains all sorts of non-economic processes and non-capitalist processes as well. It remains a society of human beings, who have certain requirements or needs that cannot easily be met through a commercial business. And the majority of capital assets in developed capitalist countries are, even though they attract profit, not physical means of production, but financial assets or non-productive physical assets such as real estate or durables. This can be easily verified from national capital stock and asset inventory data (provided in national accounts or flow of funds tables). *Physical/social distinction. Scholars often conflate the (expanded) physical reproduction of goods and services necessary for human survival with the (expanded) reproduction of capital. They assume that a certain market balance or market proportionality is essential for an equilibrium growth path. In fact, Marx never argued that capitalist society is \\"held together\\" or \\"balanced out\\" by the market itself, and he denied that equilibrium ever existed anywhere, other than as a momentary coincidence. Instead, \\"what held society together\\" was the compulsion to produce and reproduce for a living, given a system of property rights enforced by the state. Marxists call this viewpoint Marx's historical materialism. Once the basic needs of all could be met and organized capitalistically, the further development of capital accumulation could take directions quite unrelated to the direct requirements of economic reproduction. Indeed, this was also part of Marx's critique of capitalism: significant funds could be invested in ways that did not benefit society at all, with the effect that activities and assets essential to maintain society's well-being might be starved of funds. That is, within certain absolute limits, the requirements for physical reproduction and for capital accumulation might not be the same at all. Capital would be invested for profit, but basic necessities might be ignored. An example might be the 2007–2008 world food price crisis, which indicates that insufficient capital has been invested in food production. This might seem strange, since food is a basic requirement of human life. But, as Marx would presumably argue, what makes a profit is not necessarily what people really need, and therefore the possibility exists that profit making may undermine the most basic conditions for economic reproduction, including the supply of food and clean water, sanitation, adequate shelter, schooling, health care, and the like. These conditions are undermined not because capitalists dislike investing in these things—they might love to invest in them, if they could—but rather because it is difficult to make a secure profit from doing so. The required investments may be very large and long term, tying up capital for many years, but either there is no possibility for profit or it is uncertain whether a sufficient profit can and will be made. If, for example, foreign investors invested in a country's essential infrastructure, a falling currency exchange rate some years later might wipe out the profits they could get. Therefore, such investments could occur only if foreign or local government authorities (and ultimately taxpayers) subsidized them (or at any rate, if they acted as a guarantor for the investments), or if financial institutions could find sufficient financial insurance to protect the value of investment capital through terms that reduce financial risk to investors. Reproduction of labor power Reproduction can also refer to the worker's daily reproduction of his or her own labor power. This consists of the tasks of everyday existence—food preparation, laundry, and so forth—that maintain the worker and his or her ability to work. Since roughly the 16th century, much of this domestic labor has been made the responsibility of women, through various developments put in motion by powerful institutions in the transition period from feudalism to capitalism. Adding to the process of social degradation of women in that period was the devaluation of the reproduction of labor. As Silvia Federici notes, \\"In the new monetary regime, only production-for-market was defined as value-creating activity, whereas the reproduction of the worker began to be considered as valueless from an economic viewpoint and even ceased to be considered as work\\".Silvia Federici, \\"Caliban and the Witch\\" 2004:75. \\"Reproductive work continued to be paid - though at the lowest rates - when performed for the master class or outside the home. But the economic importance of the reproduction of labor-power carried out in the home, and its function in the accumulation of capital became invisible, being mystified as a natural vocation and labelled \\"women's labor\\". In addition, women were excluded from many waged occupations and, when they worked for a wage, they earned a pittance compared to the average male wage\\" Thus it is of particular interest in feminist economics. For example, it was reported in 1988 that the paid work done by both men and women outside the home in West Germany totalled 55,000 million hours a year, earning them a total of $335 billion; but housework done by women inside the home totalled 53,000 million hours a year, which earned them no salary at all.New Internationalist, issue 181, March 1988. One of the principal inventors of modern national accounts, Simon Kuznets, did at one time suggest that the value of household labour should be estimated as a standard measure, even just for the sake of objectivity about the economy, but that argument was rejected. He stated: Later, the economist Robert Eisner tried to estimate the value of \\"non-market outputs\\".Robert Eisner, The total incomes system of accounts. University of Chicago Press, 1989. His calculations suggested that in the United States, the value of unpaid household work declined from about 45% of conventional Gross National Product in 1945 to about 33% in 1981.Robert Eisner, The total incomes system of accounts. University of Chicago Press, 1989, p. 41f.cf. Review of Income and Wealth, series 37, number 4, December 1991, p. 455.

Tryon (September 4, 1940 – December 11, 2019) was an American scientist and a professor emeritus of physics at Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY). He was the first physicist to propose that our universe originated as a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum.Impey, p.411 Early life Tryon was born and raised in Terre Haute, Indiana.gribbin, p.303 He took his first physics course in his junior year at Wiley High School.Parker, p.186 Academia and intellectual influences Tryon entered Cornell University in 1958. He was influenced by Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe, who was one of his professors. He was especially affected by advice that Bethe gave him: \\"Our intuition is based on our experiences in the macroscopic world. There is no reason to expect our intuition to be valid for microscopic phenomena.\\"Parker, pp.186-187 He graduated from Cornell University in 1962, earning a bachelors in physics. He would then go on to do his graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley. There he was very much influenced by Steven Weinberg. He took courses taught by Weinberg, who would later become a mentor to him.Parker, pp. 187-188 His doctoral thesis focused on the relationship between general relativity and quantum field theoryParker, p.188 and was titled: \\"Classical and Quantum Field-Theoretic Derivations of Gravitational Theory.\\" He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley with a PhD in physics in 1967. Dennis Sciama and the idea that the universe is a vacuum fluctuation In 1969, (some versions of this story say 1970), Tryon was at a lecture taking place at Columbia University being given by British cosmologist Dennis Sciama.Guth, p.12 And when Sciama paused for a moment in his speaking, Tryon suddenly said out loud: \\"Maybe the universe is a vacuum fluctuation?\\"Gribbin, p.304 Everyone laughed, assuming it was a joke.Vilenkin, p.183 Embarrassed, he did not explain to anyone that this was not the case. Tryon says he only remembered this incident after he was reminded of it when he published a paper about this subject matter.Parker, p. 189 Career Tryon's specialization is in theoretical quark models, theoretical general relativity, and cosmology. In 1973, he proposed that the universe is a large-scale quantum fluctuation in vacuum energy. This is called vacuum genesis or the zero-energy universe hypothesis. He has been quoted as saying, \\"the universe is simply one of those things that happens from time to time\\".\\"Guth, p.14 In 1967, he began working at Columbia University as a research assistant. In 1968 he began working as an assistant professor and worked there until 1971. Tryon left Columbia University in 1971 and began working at Hunter College of the City University of New York, where he spent the rest of his academic career teaching as a professor. Is the universe a vacuum fluctuation? In the early 1970s, there was still a strong belief among physicists that no one could speak about what came before the Big Bang and stay within the boundaries of science.Chaisson, p.42 It was almost universally accepted that no scientist could explain why there is something and not nothing. This was the scientific climate Tryon existed in as he was getting settled working at Hunter College. But soon after arriving there he found himself in a writing project that he thought required him to do an exhaustive study of how modern science perceives our universe.Parker, pp. 189-190 In studying the many ways cosmologists see our universe, he thought he had discovered a way it might have come into existence that no one had ever thought of. He then wrote his idea up as a scientific paper and tried to get it published. He submitted it to Physical Review Letters, but they rejected it. He then sent it to the British scientific journal Nature, hoping it might be accepted as a \\"letter to the editor\\". An editor from the journal did not just accept it, but decided to make it a feature article.Guth, p.271 The paper appeared in Nature in December, 1973, with the title: \\"Is the Universe a Vacuum Fluctuation?\\" It proposed the idea that our universe had originated from a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum. The cosmologist Alexander Vilenkin said of the paper: \\"Now, what Tryon was suggesting was that our entire universe, with its vast amount of matter, was a huge quantum fluctuation, which somehow failed to disappear for more than ten billion years.\\"Vilenkin, p.184 Physicist Alan Guth made this comment about the paper: \\"In his controversial two-page paper, Tryon advanced the startling proposal that on rare occasions, whole universes might materialize from the vacuum, and our universe may have begun this way.\\"Guth, p.272 This was the first time any scientist had used science to try to explain how our universe may have originated from nothing. In his paper, Tryon first deals with the idea of how our universe could have come from nothing and stay within the laws of physics. The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can not be created or destroyed. Tryon needed to assert that our universe could come from nothing without breaking this law of the conservation of energy. He theorized that all the positive mass energy and all the negative gravitational energy cancel each other out, leaving us with a universe with zero energy. Tryon gives credit for learning this idea from the general relativist Peter Bergmann. The person who first proposed the idea that we might live in a universe equaling zero because mass positive energy is equal to gravitation negative energy was the physicist Richard C. Tolman. Because Tryon believed our universe was equal to zero energy, in his paper Tryon said: \\"If this be the case, then our Universe could have appeared from nowhere without violating any conservation laws.\\" Tryon then goes on to describe how our universe could have come from a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum. He does this by simply applying our current scientific laws such as quantum mechanics and quantum field theory which exist in our universe, to that era before our universe was here. Like many physicists he believes that a vacuum, or empty space, existed before our universe existed. According to physics, because of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, every vacuum has something in it. At the quantum level, because of the uncertainty principle, the law of the conservation of energy can be broken for just a brief moment, causing virtual particles to pop in and out of existence. Tryon says virtual particles also existed in the vacuum that was here before our universe existed, and these quantum fluctuations from nothing (the vacuum) eventually led to one of these particles popping into existence and becoming our universe.Gleiser, p.307 Tryon is not able to explain how one of these virtual particles grows to become a universe like ours, but he does say in his paper \\"that the laws of physics place no limit on the scale of vacuum fluctuations\\". He also mentions in his paper how \\"vacuum fluctuations of our Universe are probably quite rare\\". While Tryon was the first person to say that our universe was a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum, the German physicist Pascual Jordan was the first person to talk about how a star might be created from the vacuum by a quantum transition. In the 1930s a number of physicists were looking at how to explain where matter was coming from if we lived in a continuous universe (an eternal one, always here). Jordan knew how a sun's mass positive energy could cancel out its gravitational negative energy, leaving a sun with zero energy. This led him to speculate what would prevent a quantum transition from the vacuum from creating a new sun.Gribbin, p.344 Jordan was not suggesting that our universe could have come about by a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum, but how matter might be generated if we existed in an eternal universe. In the early 1970s, a Ukrainian from Soviet Russia named P. I. Fomin (Peter Ivanovych Fomin) seems to have independently come up with the idea that our universe could have come about by a quantum process. However, he did not publish anything until 1975, almost two years after Tryon came out with his paper, which resulted in the scientific community giving Tryon credit for coming up with this idea first. Tryon also believed that this quantum event was without a purpose or cause. In essence, he was saying \\"that our universe could have originated in this way and emphasized such a creation event would not require a cause\\".Vilenkin, pp. 184-185 This is why in his paper he said: \\"In answer to the question of why it happened, I offer the modest proposal that our Universe is simply one of those things which happen from time to time\\". Even though this paper gives the impression that the mystery of where our universe originated is solved, it is not. In his paper Tryon mentions how there is this \\"larger space in which our Universe is embedded,\\" but this place is given only a very vague and short description. Additionally, while Tryon says our universe came into being from an accident of the laws of physics, he does not say what created the laws of physics, leaving the mystery incompletely solved.

Beth Sulzer-Azaroff is a psychologist at University of Massachusetts Amherst, Department of Psychology It is the applied form of behavior analysis; the other two forms are radical behaviorism (or the philosophy of the science) and the experimental analysis of behavior (or basic experimental research). The name \\"applied behavior analysis\\" has replaced behavior modification because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior- environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment. Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors. ABA has been utilized in a wide range of areas, including early behavioral interventions for autism, rehabilitation of brain injury, research on the principles influencing criminal behavior, as well as HIV prevention, conservation of natural resources, education, gerontology, health and fitness, industrial safety, language acquisition, littering, medical procedures, parenting, psychotherapy, seatbelt use, severe mental disorders, sports, substance abuse, phobias, pediatric feeding disorders, and zoo management and care of animals. ABA is controversial within the autism rights movement due to its emphasis on normalization instead of acceptance and a history of, in some embodiments of what was then called behavior modification, the use of aversive electric shocks. Definition ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior. It is to be distinguished from the experimental analysis of behavior, which focuses on basic experimental research, but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular operant conditioning and classical conditioning. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of radical behaviorism, treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of behavior modification. Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a natural science as opposed to a social science. As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including antecedents and consequences, without resort to \\"hypothetical constructs\\". History The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to Teodoro Ayllon and Jack Michael's study \\"The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer\\" (1959) that they submitted to the Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the University of Houston. Ayllon and Michael were training the staff and nurses at a psychiatric hospital how to use a token economy based on the principles of operant conditioning with their patients, who were mostly adults with schizophrenia, but some were also mentally retarded children. This paper later served as the basis for the founding of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (JABA), which publishes research on the application of behavior analysis to a wide array of socially relevant behavior. A group of faculty and researchers at the University of Washington, including Donald Baer, Sidney W. Bijou, Bill Hopkins, Jay Birnbrauer, Todd Risley, and Montrose Wolf, applied the principles of behavior analysis to instruct developmentally disabled children, manage the behavior of children and adolescents in juvenile detention centers, and organize employees who required proper structure and management in businesses, among other situations. In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas, where they founded the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis. Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and Ivar Lovaas. Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior, and relied upon the methods of errorless learning that was initially devised by Charles Ferster to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury. In 1987, Lovaas published the study, \\"Behavioral treatment and normal educational and intellectual functioning in young autistic children\\". The experimental group in this study received up to 40 hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting at a table using errorless discrete trial training (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact, fine and gross motor imitation, and language. ABA principles were used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, \\"Long-term outcome for children with autism who received early intensive behavioral treatment\\". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research were replicated in university and private settings. The \\"Lovaas Method\\" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or 30 to 40 hours per week of DTT. Over the years, \\"behavior analysis\\" gradually superseded \\"behavior modification\\"; that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior. This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior. While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used in a broad range of other situations. Recent notable areas of research in JABA include autism, classroom instruction with typically developing students, pediatric feeding therapy, and substance-use disorders. Other applications of ABA include applied animal behavior, consumer behavior analysis, behavioral medicine, behavioral neuroscience, clinical behavior analysis, forensic behavior analysis, increasing job safety and performance, school-wide positive behavior support, and systematic desensitization for phobias. Characteristics Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article is still used as the standard description of ABA. It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA. * Applied: ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved. * Behavioral: ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described. * Analytic: Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation. Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations. The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. * Technological: The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately. Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement. * Conceptually Systematic: Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions. Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as \\"secondary reinforcement\\" or \\"errorless discrimination\\" where appropriate. * Effective: Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed * Generality: Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects. =Other proposed characteristics= In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added: * Accountable: To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness. * Public: The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations. * Doable: To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.Heward, 205 p. 322 * Empowering: ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness. * Optimistic: According to several leading authors , behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons: ** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment. ** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements. ** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success. ** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable. Concepts =Behavior= Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment. Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a response is a single instance of that behavior. If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. \\"Repertoire\\" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do. Operant conditioning Operant behavior is the so-called \\"voluntary\\" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the three-term contingency that uses stimulus control, in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as reinforcement or punishment. The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades. Respondent (classical) conditioning Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not produce a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food because it salivates). =Environment= The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.Michael, J. (2004). Concepts and principles of behavior analysis (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis. This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included. A stimulus is an \\"energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells\\". A stimulus can be described: * Topographically by its physical features. * Temporally by when it occurs. * Functionally by its effect on behavior. =Reinforcement= inflict sensory or physical pain, is an area of controversy. Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning and in most behavior change programs. It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement. There are multiple schedules of reinforcement that affect the future probability of behavior. =Punishment= Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added (positive punishment) or removed (negative punishment). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out'). Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects. Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it. =Extinction= Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.Miltenberger, R. G. \\"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\\". Thomson/Wadsworth, 2008. p. 102. The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.Miltenberger, R. G. \\"Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures\\". Thomson/Wadsworth, 2008. p. 104. Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of shaping procedures. =Discriminated operant and three-term contingency= In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts. This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (SD). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of stimulus control. More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as \\"Setting Event\\", \\"Establishing Operations\\", and \\"Motivating Operations\\" by various researchers in their publications. =Verbal behavior= B.F. Skinner's classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. SPL-ABA 1(4)–2(1), 97–138 Skinner's system includes: * Tact (psychology) – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement. * Mand (psychology) – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer. * Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question). * Autoclitic – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of \\"I think...\\" vs. \\"I know...\\") For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills. Measuring behavior When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus. =Repeatability= Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs. * Count is the number of occurrences in behavior. * Rate/frequency is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time. * Celeration is the measure of how the rate changes over time. =Temporal extent= This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs. * Duration is the period of time over which the behavior occurs. =Temporal locus= Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs. * Response latency is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response. * Interresponse time is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class. =Derivative measures= Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions: * Percentage is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities. * Trials-to- criterion are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance. Analyzing behavior change =Experimental control= In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following: * At least one participant * At least one behavior (dependent variable) * At least one setting * A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data * At least one treatment or intervention condition * Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed * An intervention that will benefit the participant in some wayBehavioral Cusp Methodologies developed through ABA research =Task analysis= Task analysis is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: forward chaining, backward chaining and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals). Behavioral scripts often emerge from a task analysis. Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills. A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors. Ivey would later call this \\"behaviorist\\" phase a very productive one and the skills-based approach came to dominate counselor training during 1970–90. Task analysis was also used in determining the skills needed to access a career. In education, Englemann (1968) used task analysis as part of the methods to design the Direct Instruction curriculum. =Chaining= The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc. For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior. Some behavior therapies, such as dialectical behavior therapy, make extensive use of behavior chain analysis, but is not philosophically behavior analytic. =Prompting= A prompt is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual. Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g., verbal). In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically. During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting. Types of prompts Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response: * Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations * Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture * Gestural prompts: A physical gesture * Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual. * Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model. * Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap). This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual. =Fading= The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill. =Thinning a reinforcement schedule= Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements. Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin. Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in contingency management and token economy systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see professional practice of behavior analysis).Bailey, J.S. & Burch, M.R. (2005). Ethics for behavior analysts. LEA =Generalization= Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill. Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or school and generalize the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization. =Shaping= Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then they could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which they touch the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of operant conditioning principles and extinction. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks. One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and motor responses, in some cases for long chains of behavior. =Interventions based on an FBA= Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral case formulation with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core. This approach should apply a behavior analytic theory of change (see Behavioral change theories). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain) and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior. Some argue that behavior analytic case formulation can be improved with an assessment of rules and rule-governed behavior. Some of the interventions that result from this type of conceptualization involve training specific communication skills to replace the problem behaviors as well as specific setting, antecedent, behavior, and consequence strategies. Use in the treatment of autism spectrum disorders ABA-based techniques are often used to teach adaptive behaviors or to diminish behaviors associated with autism, so much that ABA itself is often mistakenly considered to be synonymous with therapy for autism. It is also the gold standard treatment for that diagnosis as it is considered to be most effective according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. ABA for autism may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ. = Efficacy = Recent reviews of the efficacy of ABA-based techniques in autism include: * A 2007 clinical report of the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) \\"has been well documented\\" and that \\"children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and adaptive behavior as well as some measures of social behavior\\". * Researchers from the MIND Institute published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of \\"the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies\\", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the Lovaas technique created by Ole Ivar Løvaas) is \\"well-established\\" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD. * A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality (\\"Level 1\\" or \\"Level 2\\") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is \\"well-established\\" and is \\"demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists\\". However, the review committee also concluded that \\"there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective\\". * A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a meta-analysis of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were \\"generally positive\\" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other \\"empirically validated treatment programs\\". * In a 2009 systematic review of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote \\"there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment\\". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention. * A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a \\"large\\" effect on full-scale intelligence and a \\"moderate\\" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children. * A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews. Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior. In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI. Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI. Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site randomized trials are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism. * In 2011, investigators from Vanderbilt University under contract with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the UCLA/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and Geraldine Dawson). They concluded that \\"both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills\\". However, they also concluded that \\"the strength of evidence ... is low\\", \\"many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment\\", \\"subgroups may account for a majority of the change\\", there is \\"little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies\\", and the published studies \\"used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements\\". * An October 2019 report by the United States Department of Defense found that \\"76 percent of TRICARE beneficiaries in the ACD had little to no change in symptom presentation over the course of 12 months of applied behavior analysis (ABA) services, with an additional 9 percent demonstrating worsening symptoms.\\"TRICARE Autism Report =Use of aversives= Some embodiments of applied behavior analysis as devised by Ole Ivar Lovaas used aversives such as electric shocks to modify undesirable behavior in their initial use in the 1970s. Over time the use of aversives lessened and in 2012 their use was described as being inconsistent with contemporary practice. However, a minority of clinicians have disagreed. In comments made in 2014 to the FDA, a clinician who previously worked at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center claimed that \\"all textbooks used for thorough training of applied behavior analysts include an overview of the principles of punishment, including the use of electrical stimulation.\\" In 2020, the FDA banned the use of electrical stimulation devices used for self- injurious or aggressive behavior and asserted that \\"Evidence indicates a number of significant psychological and physical risks are associated with the use of these devices, including worsening of underlying symptoms, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, pain, burns and tissue damage.\\" =Controversy= The value of eliminating autistic behaviors is disputed by proponents of neurodiversity, who claim that it forces autistics to mask their true personalities on behalf of a narrow conception of normality. Autism advocates contend that it is cruel to try to make autistic people \\"normal\\" without consideration for how this may affect their well-being. Instead, these critics advocate for increased social acceptance of harmless autistic traits and therapies focused on improving quality of life. Julia Bascom of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network (ASAN) has said, \\"ASAN's objection is fundamentally an ethical one. The stated end goal of ABA is an autistic child who is 'indistinguishable from their peers'—an autistic child who can pass as neurotypical. We don’t think that’s an acceptable goal. The end goal of all services, supports, interventions, and therapies an autistic child receives should be to support them in growing up into an autistic adult who is happy, healthy, and living a self-determined life.” Major journals Applied behavior analysts publish in many journals.

The group also secured a parking/tie-down area (paved with concrete), and has added a picnic area within walking distance to the parking/tie-down area overlooking the Pacific Ocean. In the 1940s, a small aircraft landing strip was built at Camp McQuaide so airplanes could drop targets into the ocean. After the end of the war, in 1948, it was converted to the private boarding school Monterey Bay Academy. Between 1980 and 1984 the airport was home to Pterodactyl Limited, which manufactured ultralight aircraft.

The first issue was published on March 11, 1998. Initially published every other week, it scaled back to 24 issues a year in early 2016, then became a monthly in its later days. The main sports covered include Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, National Football League, National Hockey League, college basketball, and college football. The magazine typically takes a more lighthearted and humorous approach to sporting news compared with competitors such as Sports Illustrated and, previously, the Sporting News. On April 30, 2019, ESPN announced they would cease paper publishing in September 2019. Departments Some of the regular departments, in their magazine order: * Two Way: Stuart Scott answered questions from readers, giving his own opinions. * The Biz: Peter King writes about the business side of sports and its effect on the sporting world. * The Post: Looking back at the previous edition of the magazine with some of the readers' comments and updates on past stories. * Zoom: One large \\"image of the week,\\" occupying two pages. * The Jump: A mix of different regular features, offering an alternative and usually humorous take on the current sporting scene. * Outtakes: A transcript of an interview from The Dan Patrick Show with a sport star mostly talking about non sports issues. Kenny Mayne succeeded Patrick in this regular feature. * The Life of Reilly: Former Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly gives his opinions on the sports world, and reports upon various \\"special interest\\" stories in sports. * NEXT Athlete: Yearly award given out to young rising star athletes. * Athlete X: a feature that ran in the late 2000s where an anonymous athlete from various sports (MLB, NFL, and NASCAR) offered an insider's perspective. Most of these departments and features were dropped after a 2011 editorial change. By 2016, only Zoom and The Biz still appeared regularly. There is also a recurring column that focuses on Sabermetrics, as well as The Truth, a back-page editorial that focuses on controversial topics. The Big Ticket, similar to The Jump, was introduced when ESPN Mag became a monthly in Fall 2018. The Body Issue The annual \\"Body Issue\\", which debuted in 2009 as its answer to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue, features naked and scantily-clad athletes. The \\"Body Issue\\" addresses the physical structure of the most popular athletes to show what parts of their body they see as almost \\"perfect\\".

Language and History in the Early Germanic World. Cambridge University Press, , p.167. Whether the story reproduced by Jordanes contains factual information, and if so which parts, is no longer possible to ascertain with any certainty. Name etymology Jordanes does not give an etymology, but many scholars interpret this word as a dative plural to the widespread Germanic words *aujō- or *auwō- and means \\"well-watered meadow\\" or \\"island\\". The word is believed to be related to older words for water, including Gothic ahwa Latin aqua, ultimately a well-attested Proto Indoeuropean root. This is seen as consistent with the description Jordanes gave of the Goths delight in this region's fertility. As mentioned for example by Dennis H. Green (p.167) Jordanes describes another place with a similar name — the place where the Goths' relatives the Gepids lived: :XVII (96) These Gepidae were then smitten by envy while they dwelt in the province of Spesis on an island surrounded by the shallow waters of the Vistula. This island they called, in the speech of their fathers, Gepedoios [emphasis added]; but it is now [in the 6th century] inhabited by the race of the Vividarii, since the Gepidae themselves have moved to better lands. The Vividarii are gathered from various races into this one asylum, if I may call it so, and thus they form a nation. (97) So then, as we were saying, Fastida, king of the Gepidae, stirred up his quiet people to enlarge their boundaries by war. He overwhelmed the Burgundians, almost annihilating them, and conquered a number of other races also. Chronology A problem with Jordanes' account is that he dates the arrival of the Goths in Oium well before 1000 BCE (approximately 5 generations after 1490). Historians who accept Jordanes' account as partially reflecting real events, do not accept this aspect. Jordanes Mierow's translation of the one short passage in Getica IV, which mentions Oium is as follows: :[...] But when the number of the people increased greatly and Filimer, son of Gadaric, reigned as king — about the fifth since Berig — he decided that the army of the Goths with their families should move from that region. :(27) In search of suitable homes and pleasant places they came to the land of Scythia, called Oium in that tongue. Here they were delighted with the great richness of the country, and it is said that when half the army had been brought over, the bridge whereby they had crossed the river fell in utter ruin, nor could anyone thereafter pass to or fro. :For the place is said to be surrounded by quaking bogs and an encircling abyss, so that by this double obstacle nature has made it inaccessible. And even to-day one may hear in that neighborhood the lowing of cattle and may find traces of men, if we are to believe the stories of travellers, although we must grant that they hear these things from afar. :(28) This part of the Goths, which is said to have crossed the river and entered with Filimer into the country of Oium, came into possession of the desired land, and there they soon came upon the race [gens] of the Spali, joined battle with them and won the victory. Thence the victors hastened to the farthest part of Scythia, which is near the sea of Pontus; for so the story is generally told in their early songs, in almost historic fashion. Ablabius also, a famous chronicler of the Gothic race, confirms this in his most trustworthy account. :(29) Some of the ancient writers also agree with the tale. [...] The place where they first arrived is thus described not as the whole of Scythia, which Jordanes describes in the subsequent chapter (V), but a remote and isolated part of it, where the Spali lived. The Goths coming from the Baltic crossed a bridge to get there, but when it broke, it became impossible to cross back and forth anymore. Returning to his narrative, Jordanes described the area where Filimer subsequently moved his people and settled as being near the Sea of Azov, noting that there are verbal legends around about Gothic origins, but that he prefers to trust what he reads: :(38) We read that on their first migration the Goths dwelt in the land of Scythia near Lake Maeotis [the Sea of Azov; the Latin calls it a marsh, not a sea or lake: paludem Meotidem]. On the second migration they went to Moesia, Thrace and Dacia, and after their third they dwelt again in Scythia, above the Sea of Pontus. :[...] :Of course if anyone in our city says that the Goths had an origin different from that I have related, let him object. For myself, I prefer to believe what I have read, rather than put trust in old wives' tales. :(39) To return, then, to my subject. The aforesaid race of which I speak is known to have had Filimer as king while they remained in their first home in Scythia near Maeotis. In their second home, that is in the countries of Dacia, Thrace and Moesia, Zalmoxes reigned, whom many writers of annals mention as a man of remarkable learning in philosophy. According to Jordanes, the Goths left Oium in a second migration to Moesia, Dacia and Thrace, but they eventually returned, settling north of the Black Sea. Upon their return, they were divided under two ruling dynasties. The Visigoths were ruled by the Balþi and the Ostrogoths by the Amali. The identified places Jordanes himself understands Oium to be near the Sea of Azov, which was understood to be a marshy area in this period. Wolfram (p.42) for example interprets Jordanes in a straightforward way to be referring to a place on the shore of the Sea of Azov. The Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde (RGA) article on Oium, for example, proposes, based upon a proposal by Herwig Wolfram, that the uncrossable river with a broken bridge might be the Dnieper. The bridge story itself can not be taken literally as bridges crossing major rivers were not known in this area more than 1000 years BCE. It can therefore only refer to events in a much later period. Both Herwig Wolfram and Walter Goffart see the bridge story as likely to be symbolic. Based upon a proposal by Norbert Wagner, the RGA suggests that the marshes surrounding Oium could be the Pripyat or Rokitno marshes in the area of the modern border of Belarus and Ukraine. This is to the west of the Dnieper, and not near Southern Russia where Wagner believed Oium was, and so Wagner saw this area, which contains the Pripyat River, as representing the \\"river\\" which needed to be crossed en route to Oium. Jordanes' sources As explained above, Jordanes represented his story as being consistent with history-like Gothic songs, and the lost work of Ablabius. He also specifically expressed his preference for written sources in defending this Oium account against legends he had encountered in Constantinople. Concerning the larger work where this story appears, the Getica, Jordanes also explained in his prefaces to it and his other surviving work, the Romana, that he had started the work with the aim of summarizing a far larger work written by Cassiodorus, which has not survived. According to some historians, Jordanes' account of the Goths' history in Oium was constructed from his reading of earlier classical accounts and from oral tradition.Wolfram, Herwig (2006). \\"Gothic history as historical ethnography\\" and Origo et religio: ethnic traditions and literature in early medieval texts\\". In From Roman Provinces to Medieval Kingdoms. Ed. Thomas F. X. Noble, Routledge, , pp. 43-90. According to other historians, Jordanes' narrative has little relation to Cassiodorus's, no relation to oral traditions and little relation to actual history. Archaeology Historians such as Peter Heather, Walter Goffart, Patrick Geary, A. S. Christensen and Michael Kulikowski have criticized the use of the Getica as a source for details about real Gothic origins.Kulikowski, Michael: Rome's Gothic Wars, p. 66. Archaeologically, the Chernyakhov culture, which is also called the Sântana de Mureș culture, contained parts of Ukraine, Moldova and Romania and corresponds with the extent of Gothic-influenced Scythia as known from 3rd and 4th century contemporaries.On the identification of Oium with the Sintana de Mures/Chernyakhov culture-area see , , For archaeologists who subscribe to the proposal that Jordanes' account of migration from the Vistula can be seen in archaeological evidence, the Vistula archaeological culture which is proposed to represent the earlier Goths is the Wielbark culture. The account of Jordanes fits with the interpretation of the Wielbark and Chernyakhov cultures, in which Germanic peoples from the Vistula Basin, moved towards, influenced, and began to culturally dominate, peoples in the Ukraine. Some of the historians who agree with this scenario, such as Herwig Wolfram, propose that this did not require significant amounts of people to move. Norse mythology In The origin of Rus, Omeljan Pritsak connects the Hervarar saga with its account of Gothic legendary history and of battles with the Huns, with historical place names in Ukraine from 150 to 450 AD, This places the Goths' capital Árheimar, on the river Dniepr (Danpar). The connection to Oium was made by both Heinzel and Schütte. However the attribution of places, people, and events in the saga is confused and uncertain, with multiple scholarly views on who, where, and what real things the legend refers to.

It covers the south of Bavarian Swabia, southeastern Baden-Württemberg and parts of Austria. The region stretches from the prealpine lands up to the Alps. The main rivers flowing through the Allgäu are the Lech and Iller. Allgäu is not an administrative unit. The alpine regions of the Allgäu rise over 2,000 metres in altitude and are popular for winter skiing. The Allgovian area is notable for its beautiful landscapes and is popular for vacations and therapeutic stays.Its scenic countryside can be seen in Asmus, C. and Bufe, S. \\"Dampflokomotiven im Allgau\\" (1977, Hermann Merker). It is well known in Germany for its farm produce, especially dairy products including Hirtenkäse (\\"herdsman's cheese\\") and Bergkäse (\\"mountain cheese\\"). Besides tourism and dairy products, another important economic sector is the building of industrial equipment and machines. Fendt tractors, developed and produced in Marktoberdorf are one of the most famous products of the region. The castle of Neuschwanstein is in the eastern part of the Allgäu. The Allgäu is dominated in the south by the Allgäu Alps, which are not part of the Allgäu themselves. The Allgäu is formed mainly by glaciers and glacial debris.

She was the daughter of Oichi and sister of Ohatsu and Oeyo. She was a concubine and second wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who was then the most powerful man in Japan. She also became the mother of his son and successor, Hideyori. Her time period being that of large turmoil and overhaul, Yodo-dono had an interest toward both politics and administration. She actively acted in the restoration of the Toyotomi clan after the fall of the Council of Five Elders, as Hideyori's guardian. Alongside her son, Yodo-dono led the last anti-Tokugawa shogunate resistance in the Siege of Osaka. When her two younger sisters became prominent members linked to the Tokugawa clan, Oichi's three daughters were vital to maintaining a diplomatic relationship between the two most powerful clans of the time, Toyotomi and Tokugawa. Her sister, Oeyo, was the wife of the second shogun, Tokugawa Hidetada, and matriarch of the successive Shoguns lineage, thus receiving the political title Omidaidokoro. The relationship of Tokugawa and Toyotomi has been falling steadily since Hideyoshi's death, so it led both clans to the Battle of Sekigahara and later to the Siege of Osaka. Due to the attempt to exalt the Tokugawa Shogunate, Yodo-dono was frequently portrayed as a \\"wicked and wanton\\" woman who planned the Toyotomis' death. She was also known as Lady Chacha (茶々). After the death of Hideyoshi, she took the tonsure, becoming a Buddhist nun and taking the name Daikōin (大広院). She was the founder of the temple Yogen-in (養源院). The great wealth and changing fortunes of her family affected Yodo-dono's life as well.

(2002). Japan's Golden Age: Momoyama, p. 283. Genealogy Yodo-dono, also called in her youth, was the eldest of three daughters of the Sengoku period daimyō Azai Nagamasa. Her mother, Oichi was the younger sister of Oda Nobunaga.\\"The silk coloured portrait of wife of Takatsugu Kyogoku\\", Digital Cultural Properties of Wakasa Obama; Oichinokata, Gifu prefecture website. After Nagamasa's death, Toyotomi Hideyoshi became the adoptive father and protector of Chacha.Wilson, Richard L. (1985). Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743), p. 40. Her status changed once when she became his concubine, and once again when she became the mother of his heir. Yodo-dono's middle sister, Ohatsu, was the wife of Kyōgoku Takatsugu and the mother of Kyōgoku Tadataka. Yodo-dono's youngest sister, Oeyo, also known as Ogō, was the principal wife of Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada and the mother of his successor Tokugawa Iemitsu. Early years In 1570, Chacha's father, Nagamasa, broke his alliance with Oda Nobunaga and there was a three-year period of fighting until 1573 when Nobunaga's army surrounded Nagamasa at Odani Castle. Nobunaga, however, requested the safe return of his sister, Oichi. Chacha, along with her mother and her two sisters, left the castle with her. Odani castle fell, and amongst those who died were Nagamasa and Manpukumaru, Chacha's only brother. Nobunaga's death in 1582 caused open hostilities between Shibata Katsuie and Hashiba Hideyoshi over the issue of succession. Katsuie's forces were defeated at the Battle of Shizugatake, and he was forced retreat to Kitanosho castle. With Hideyoshi's army laying siege to his home, Katsuie set the castle ablaze; he and Oichi perished in it. However, before Oichi died, she passed Chacha, Oeyo, and Ohatsu to the care and protection of Hideyoshi. She was skilled with Waka poetry and was regarded as the highest ranked princess of the Azai family. She treated her sisters and other relatives well though it is said that she was also a passionate speaker regarding the Toyotomi's future. Concubine of Hideyoshi 205x205px In 1588, Yodogimi became pregnant. Hideyoshi, who did not yet have a son, was greatly pleased. Hideyoshi's younger brother Toyotomi Hidenaga remodeled the Yodo castle in March 1589. After this, Hideyoshi gave Yodo castle to Chacha, probably to appeal the existence of his son to the retainers who passes between Osaka and Kyoto city. Hideyoshi's wife, Nene, was said to have been unable to conceive; and thus Lady Yodo inherited many of her privileges. She had two sons with Hideyoshi, Tsurumatsu, who died young, and Hideyori, born in 1593, who became Hideyoshi's designated successor. In 1594, the family moved to Fushimi Castle, but tragedy fell when Hideyoshi died in 1598. As a result, the Toyotomi clan lost much of its influence and importance. Yodo-dono founded the temple Yogen-in,(養源院) in memory of her father Azai Nagamasa and her mother Oichi. Yodo-dono then moved to Osaka Castle with her son Hideyori and plotted the restoration of the Toyotomi clan. She intervened in politics as Hideyori's guardian and became the de facto head of Osaka Castle.  Sekigahara campaign  Yodo no Kimi woodblock print by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi. After the death of Hideyoshi in 1598, Hideyori became the successor of Hideyoshi and Chacha became the mother of paramount. But Hideyori still was a child and could not manage the retainer, and conflict of front generals and administrative staff became serious. Tokugawa Ieyasu who was the largest lord under Toyotomi government aimed at next hegemony, stirred up the conflict of both party and supported front generals. Ishida Mitsunari (1560-1600), the chief administrative staff of Toyotomi government, raised his army to stop the ambition of Ieyasu, but was defeated at the Battle of Sekigahara and was executed. After the defeat of the Western Army, the Toyotomi clan lost much of its sovereignty, even though Yodo-dono did not actively participate in the Battle of Sekigahara it is said that more than 2,000 Toyotomi vassals participated in the battle and relations between Tokugawa-Toyotomi declined. Ieyasu distributes the Toyotomi family area as a prize for the Sekigahara, and the Toyotomi family will have less control. As Hideyori's guardian, Yodo-dono has the leadership of Osaka Castle, after Ieyasu ends the Council of Five elders. In 1603, Tokugawa Ieyasu was named as Shogun by the emperor, Yodo-dono began to actively resist the Tokugawa. Hideyori still kept Osaka castle and married with Princess Senhime, the daughter of Tokugawa Hidetada who was the son of Ieyasu, there was no room for two rulers. Even though having secured the Osaka castle and inherited huge amount of property from Hideyoshi, former retainers of Hideyori now supported Edo Shogunate and Hideyori’s position became quite weak. But Yodo-dono was proud of her blood, and also her status as a mother of paramount. It is said that at first Ieyasu tried to conciliate Yodo-dono and Hideyori to become subordinates to Ieyasu, but she declined.  Siege of Osaka  In 1611 Hideyori finally left Osaka, meeting with Ieyasu for two hours at Nijō Castle. Ieyasu was surprised by Hideyori's behavior, contrary to popular belief that the boy was just \\"useless\\". This belief had been spread by Katagiri Katsumoto, Hideyori's personal guardian since 1599 assigned by Ieyasu, and who had the intention of dissuading any aggression against the heir. In 1614, the Toyotomi clan rebuilt Osaka Castle. At the same time, the head of the clan sponsored the rebuilding of Hōkō-ji in Kyoto. These temple renovations included the casting of a great bronze bell, with inscriptions that read \\"May the state be peaceful and prosperous\\" (国家安康 kokka ankō), and \\"May noble lord and servants be rich and cheerful\\" (君臣豊楽 kunshin hōraku). The shogunate interpreted \\"kokka ankō\\" (国家安康) as shattering Ieyasu's name (家康) to curse him, and also interpreted \\"kunshin hōraku\\" (君臣豊楽) to mean \\"Toyotomi's force (豊臣) will rise again,\\" which meant treachery against the shogunate. Tensions began to grow between the Tokugawa and the Toyotomi clans, and only increased when Toyotomi began to gather a force of rōnin and enemies of the shogunate in Osaka. Ieyasu, despite having passed the title of Shōgun to his son in 1605, nevertheless maintained significant influence. Despite Katagiri Katsumoto's attempts to mediate the situation, Ieyasu found the ideal pretext to take a belligerent attitude against Yodo-dono and Hideyori. The situation worsened for September of that year, when the news reached Edo that in Osaka they were grouping a large quantity of rōnin at the invitation of Hideyori. Katsumoto proposed to Yodo-dono be sent to Edo as a hostage with the desire to avoid hostilities, to which she flatly refused. Suspect of trying to betray the Toyotomi clan, Yodo-dono finally banished Katsumoto and several other servants accused of treason from Osaka castle, and go to the service of the Tokugawa clan, consequently any possibility of reaching an agreement with the shogunate was dissolved. This last movement of Yodo-dono, who acted as the guardian of Hideyori, led to the beginning of the siege of Osaka.Memorial in place where Yodo-dono and Hideyori committed suicide in Osaka Castle. Tokugawa Ieyasu, who seized control from Hideyori after the death of Hideyoshi, now viewed Hideyori as an obstacle to his unification of Japan. In 1614, Ieyasu laid Siege to Osaka Castle. Yodo-dono defended the castle alongside her son, she actively participated in the siege. When the Tokugawa army bombarded her room killing two of her maids, Yodo-Dono went with three or four armed women dressed in armor and told the warriors to make a peace treaty. She met with Lady Acha which was accompanied by Honda Masazumi and Ohatsu (Yodo-dono younger sister), the treaty was accepted by both sides. However, in 1615, Ieyasu broke the truce and once again attacked Osaka Castle. Subsequently, Yodo-dono and her son Hideyori committed suicide in the flames of Osaka castle, ending the Toyotomi legacy.

This contrived protagonist is Lady Ochiba, who dislikes Toranaga (Tokugawa Ieyasu) because he presumably suspected her son was not fathered by the Taikō (Toyotomi Hideyoshi). However, she admires and trusts the Taikō's widow, Yodoko (Nene), who urges both her and Toranaga to marry so that Japan would remain united, and when the heir, Yaemon (Toyotomi Hideyori) comes of age, he can safely take control. In James Clavell's later novels it is revealed that, just as in real history, Toranaga eventually besieged Ochiba and Yaemon in their castle, prompting them to commit suicide. In the 2009 film Goemon (五右衛門), Cha-Cha is portrayed by Ryōko Hirosue, and is depicted as being in love with Ishikawa Goemon (the equivalent of Robin Hood or Ned Kelly). She is eventually forced to marry Hideyoshi, though Goemon attempts to save Cha-Cha to no avail, dying in the attempt. In the 2011 Taiga drama, Gō: Hime-tachi no Sengoku, Cha-cha was portrayed by Japanese actress Rie Miyazawa.\\"Ueno Juri's Two Older Sisters\\" (上野樹里の２人の姉) , Sponichi Annex; retrieved April 14, 2010.

Pafford is a Canadian former politician in New Brunswick. In the 1988 federal election, he ran for office as a candidate of the Confederation of Regions Party of Canada (CoR). He placed third with 10.7% of the vote in the riding of Miramichi. CoR did surprisingly well in New Brunswick, with 4.3% of the popular vote, considering it was a Western Canada-based party whose national results were less than one half of one percent. Due to this success, Pafford and other CoR supporters founded the New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party, a party to contest provincial elections. The party attracted a lot of support in anglophone areas of the province because of the collapse of the Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick in the 1987 election, and resentment against PC Premier Richard Hatfield's support of official bilingualism. The CoR party won eight seats in the 1991 New Brunswick election, and formed the official opposition. Pafford did not win a seat, finishing in third place in his Newcastle riding. As a result, Pafford resigned the leadership. In 1995, Pafford ran for mayor of the new city of Miramichi, but was defeated. He largely withdrew from the political scene, but participated with other former CoR members in founding the Grey Party of Canada in 2001.

It is situated in the valley of the Kuzuçay (Cogamus in antiquity), at the foot of the Bozdağ Mountain (Mount Tmolus in antiquity). The town is connected to İzmir by a railway. The longtime mayor is Gökhan Karaçoban. It stands on elevated ground commanding the extensive and fertile plain of the Gediz River (Hermus in antiquity), presenting an imposing appearance when seen from a distance. It has about 45 mosques. There are small industries and a fair trade. From one of the mineral springs comes a heavily charged water popular around Turkey. Within Turkey, the city's name is synonymous with the dried Sultana raisins, although cultivation for the fresh fruit market, less labour-intensive than the dried fruit, has gained prominence in recent decades. As Philadelphia, Alaşehir was a highly important center in the Early Christian and Byzantine periods. It remained a strong center of Orthodox Christianity until the early 20th century,Philadelphia, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1915). and remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church. History Church of St John, Philadelphia (Alaşehir)Ancient episcopal sees of the late Roman province of Lydia are listed in the Annuario Pontificio as titular sees:Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), \\"Sedi titolari\\", pp. 819-1013 =Ancient Philadelphia= Alaşehir began as perhaps one of the first ancient cities with the name Philadelphia. It was established in 189 BC by King Eumenes II of Pergamon (197–160 BC). Eumenes II named the city for the love of his brother, who would be his successor, Attalus II (159–138 BC), whose loyalty earned him the nickname, \\"Philadelphos\\", literally meaning \\"one who loves his brother\\". The city is perhaps best known as the site of one of the seven churches of Asia in the Book of Revelation. Lacking an heir, Attalus III Philometer, the last of the Attalid kings of Pergamum, bequeathed his kingdom, including Philadelphia, to his Roman allies when he died in 133 BC. Rome established the province of Asia in 129 BC by combining Ionia and the former Kingdom of Pergamum. St. Jean Church, carved stone slab lying on the floor in Alaşehir =Roman Philadelphia= Philadelphia was in the administrative district of Sardis (Pliny NH 5.111). In AD 17, the city suffered badly in an earthquake, and the Roman emperor Tiberius relieved it of having to pay taxes (Tacitus Annales 2.47, cf. Strabo 12.8.18, 13.4.10, John Lydus de mensibus 4.115). In response, the city granted honors to Tiberius. Evidence from coinage reveals that Caligula helped the city; under Vespasian, Philadelphia received his cognomen, Flavia. Under Caracalla, Philadelphia housed an imperial cult; its coins bore the word Neokoron (literally, \\"temple- sweeper\\"—caretaker of the temple). A small theater located at the northern edge of Toptepe Hill is all that remains of Roman Philadelphia. St. Jean Church, carved stone slab lying on the floor in Alaşehir =Philadelphia in the Book of Revelation= Although several ancient cities bore the name of Philadelphia,W. M. Ramsay, The Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia (1904), p. 391-412. this is generally agreed to be the one listed among the seven churches written to by John in the Book of Revelation. Philadelphia is listed as the sixth church of the seven. A letter specifically addressed to the Philadelphian church is recorded in (). The city's history of earthquakes may lie behind the reference to making her church \\"a pillar in the temple\\" (). Aside from the peculiar fact that Smyrna was warned of temptation lasting \\"ten days\\" while Philadelphia was promised a total exemption, or preservation, from temptation, Philadelphia shares with Smyrna the distinction of receiving nothing but praise from Christ. This explains why modern Protestant churches sometimes use \\"Philadelphia\\" as a component in the local church's name as a way of emphasizing its faithfulness. =Byzantine Philadelphia= Philadelphia was a prosperous Byzantine city, called the \\"little Athens\\" in the 6th century AD because of its festivals and temples.Lydus de mensibus 4.58 Presumably this indicates that the city wasn't entirely converted to Christianity. Ammia, the Christian prophetess, was from Philadelphia, however.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica 5.17. In about the year 600 the domed Basilica of St. John was built, remains of which are the main archaeological attraction in the modern city. The Byzantine walls that once surrounded the city have all but crumbled away. A few remnants are still visible at the northeast edge of town, near the bus stand. The city was taken by the Seljuk Turks in 1074 and 1093–94. In 1098, during the First Crusade, it was recovered by Byzantine Emperor Alexios I. In the 11th to 15th centuries AD, it was the seat of the doux (governor) and stratopedarches (military commander) of the Thrakesion theme. It was the center of several revolts against ruling Byzantine emperors- in 1182, led by John Komnenos Vatatzes, and 1188–1205 or 1206, led by Theodore Mangaphas, a local Philadelphian, against Isaac II Angelos. At that time, the bishopric of Philadelphia was promoted to metropolis. In the 14th century, Philadelphia was made the metropolis of Lydia by the Greek Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople, a status it still holds. It was granted this honor because the city did not capitulate to the Ottomans. The city was prosperous especially in the 13th and 14th centuries; there was a Genoese trading colony and the city was an important producer of leather goods and red-dyed silk (whence, perhaps, its Turkish name, which probably means \\"red city\\").I. Beldiceanu-Steinherr, \\"Notes pour l'histoire d'Alaşehir (Philadelphie) au XIVe siècle.\\" In H. Ahrweiler, 1984, Philadelphie et autres etudes. Byzantina Sorbonensia 4. Centre de recherches d'histoire et de civilisation Byzantines. Paris, p. 33 By the 14th century, the city was surrounded by Turkish emirates but maintained nominal allegiance to the Byzantine emperor. The town remained prosperous through trade and its strategic location. Philadelphia was an independent, neutral city under the influence of the Latin Knights of Rhodes, when taken in 1390 by Sultan Bayezid I and an auxiliary Christian force under the Byzantine emperor Manuel II after a prolonged resistance, by which time all the other cities of Asia Minor had surrendered to the Ottomans. Manuel had been forced by Bayezid to participate in subjugating Philadelphia to Turkish rule, a bitter irony given its long resistance. Twelve years later it was captured by Timur, who built a wall with the corpses of his prisoners. =Modern period= The Greek army occupied the city during the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922). There is dissent about who burned Philadelphia in 1922. American consul George Horton wrote in his memoirs about the Turkish army tactics of burning every Greek city they entered culminating with the great fire of Smyrna. Other accounts put the blame on the other side. The retreating Greek army carried out a scorched-earth policy while it was retreating from Anatolia during the final phase of the war,Sydney Nettleton Fisher, The Middle East: a History, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1969, p. 386 which included the Fire of Alaşehir. According to Park, 70% of the buildings of Alaşehir were destroyed by fire, and Kinross wrote, \\"Alaşehir was no more than a dark scorched cavity, defacing the hillside. Village after village had been reduced to an ash-heap.\\" It is estimated some 3,000 lives had been lost in the burning of Alaşehir.Mango, Atatürk, p. 343. A suburb of Athens, Nea Filadelfia (\\"New Philadelphia\\"), is named from the Greek refugees from Alaşehir (in Greek known as \\"Philadelphia\\") who settled there following the war and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey of 1923.

Retrieved 9 July 2018. Background From 1961 until 1991, Eritrea had fought a long war of independence against Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Civil War began on 12 September 1974 when the Marxist Derg staged a coup d'état against Emperor Haile Selassie. It lasted until 1991 when the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF)—a coalition of rebel groups led by the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front (TPLF)—overthrew the Derg government and installed a transitional government in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. The Derg government had been weakened by their loss of support due to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe. During the civil war, the groups fighting the Derg government had a common enemy, so the TPLF allied itself with the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). In 1991 as part of the United Nations-facilitated transition of power to the transitional government, it was agreed that the EPLF should set up an autonomous transitional government in Eritrea and that a referendum would be held in Eritrea to find out if Eritreans wanted to secede from Ethiopia. The referendum was held and the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of independence. In April 1993 independence was achieved and the new state joined the United Nations. In 1991, the EPLF-backed transitional government of Eritrea and the TPLF-backed transitional government of Ethiopia agreed to set up a commission to look into any problems that arose between the two former wartime allies over the foreseen independence of Eritrea. This commission was not successful, and during the following years relations between the governments of the two sovereign states deteriorated. Determining the border between the two states became a major conflict, and in November 1997 a border committee was set up to try to resolve that specific dispute. After federation and before independence, the line of the border had been of minor importance because it was only a demarcation line between federated provinces, and initially the two governments tacitly agreed that the border should remain as it had been immediately before independence. However, upon independence the border became an international frontier, and the two governments could not agree on the line that the border should take along its entire length, and they looked back to the colonial period treaties between Italy and Ethiopia for a basis in international law for the precise line of the frontier between the states. Problems then arose because they could not agree on the interpretation of those agreements and treaties, and it was not clear under international law how binding colonial treaties were on the two states. Writing after the war had finished, Jon Abbink postulated that President Isaias Afewerki of Eritrea, realising that his influence over the government in Ethiopia was slipping and given that \\"the facts on the ground, in the absence of a concrete border being marked—which anyhow lost much of its relevance after 1962 when Eritrea was absorbed by Ethiopia—have eminent relevance to any borderline decision of today\\" calculated that Eritrea could annex Badme.\\"Issaias believed that Meles was weak and that war would result in his overthrow. He was wrong.\\" () If successful, this acquisition could have been used to enhance his reputation and help maintain Eritrea's privileged economic relationship with Ethiopia. However, because Badme was in the province of Tigray, the region from which many of the members of the Ethiopian government originated (including Meles Zenawi, the former Ethiopian prime minister), the Ethiopian government came under political pressure from within the EPRDF as well as from the wider Ethiopian public to meet force with force. War =Chronology= After a series of armed incidents in which several Eritrean officials were killed near Badme, on 6 May 1998, a large Eritrean mechanized force entered the Badme region along the border of Eritrea and Ethiopia's northern Tigray Region, resulting in a firefight between the Eritrean soldiers and the Tigrayan militia and security police they encountered.The Eritreans describe the start of the war thus: \\"after a series of armed incidents during which several Eritrean officials were murdered near the disputed village of Badme, Ethiopia declared total war as on 13 May and mobilized its armed forces for a full-scale assault on Eritrea.\\" () On 13 May 1998 Ethiopia, in what Eritrean radio described as a \\"total war\\" policy, mobilized its forces for a full assault against Eritrea. The Claims Commission found that this was in essence an affirmation of the existence of a state of war between belligerents, not a declaration of war, and that Ethiopia also notified the United Nations Security Council, as required under Article 51 of the UN Charter.) The fighting quickly escalated to exchanges of artillery and tank fire, leading to four weeks of intense fighting. Ground troops fought on three fronts. On 5 June 1998, the Ethiopian Air Force launched air attacks on the airport in Asmara and the Eritreans retaliated by attacking the airport of Mekele. These raids caused civilian casualties and deaths on both sides of the border.Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal, speaking for the British government in the Eritrea and Ethiopia debate, House of Lords, (Hansard) 30 November 1999 : Column 802 The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1177 condemning the use of force and welcomed statements from both sides to end the air strikes. There was then a lull as both sides mobilized huge forces along their common border and dug extensive trenches. Both countries spent several hundred million dollars on new military equipment. This was despite the peace mediation efforts by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the US/Rwanda peace plan that was in the works. The US/Rwanda proposal was a four-point peace plan that called for withdrawal of both forces to pre-June 1998 positions. Eritrea refused, and instead demanded the demilitarization of all disputed areas along the common border, to be overseen by a neutral monitoring force, and direct talks. With Eritrea's refusal to accept the US/Rwanda peace plan, on 22 February 1999 Ethiopia launched a massive military offensive to recapture Badme. Tension had been high since 6 February 1999, when Ethiopia claimed that Eritrea had violated the moratorium on air raids by bombing Adigrat, a claim it later withdrew. Surveying the extensive trenches the Eritreans had constructed, Ethiopian General Samora Yunis observed, \\"The Eritreans are good at digging trenches and we are good at converting trenches into graves. They, too, know this. We know each other very well\\". Ethiopia's offensive, codenamed Operation Sunset, began with an air attack on Assab airport by four Ethiopian fighter jets, followed by a massive artillery barrage against Eritrean positions on the Tsorona front, which was meant as a diversion to make the Eritreans prepare for an Ethiopian offensive against eastern or southern Eritrea. The following day, the Ethiopian ground attack began. Three Ethiopian divisions broke through the Eritrean defenses in the Biyukundi area and then advanced toward Dukambiya, 20 kilometers southeast of Barentu, before turning east and hitting an Eritrean division north of Badme in the flank, taking the Eritreans by surprise. The Eritrean division was almost totally destroyed and the Ethiopians continued their advance toward Dukambiya. Realizing that they were about to be cut off, the remaining Eritrean units deployed in the Badme area hastily retreated, abandoning nearly 100 kilometers of fortifications and most of their heavy weapons. Ethiopian helicopter gunships attacked the fleeing Eritreans with rockets.https://books.google.co.il/books?id=R4iWDwAAQBAJ&pg;=PA60#v=onepage&q;&f;=false After five days of heavy fighting, Ethiopian forces were 10 kilometers (six miles) deep into Eritrean territory. Eritrea accepted the OAU peace plan on 27 February 1999. While both states said that they accepted the OAU peace plan, Ethiopia did not immediately stop its advance because it demanded that peace talks be contingent on an Eritrean withdrawal from territory occupied since the first outbreak of fighting. The widespread use of trench warfare by both sides resulted in comparisons of the conflict to the trench warfare of World War I. According to some reports, trench warfare led to the loss of \\"thousands of young lives in human-wave assaults on Eritrea's positions\\". On 16 May the BBC reported that, after a lull of two weeks, the Ethiopians had attacked at Velessa on the Tsorona front-line, south of Eritrea's capital Asmara and that after two days of heavy fighting the Eritreans had beaten back the attack claiming to have destroyed more than 45 Ethiopian tanks; although not able to verify the claim, which the Ethiopian Government dismissed as ridiculous, a BBC reporter did see more than 300 dead Ethiopians and more than 20 destroyed Ethiopian tanks. In June 1999 the fighting continued with both sides in entrenched positions. About a quarter of Eritrean soldiers were women. Proximity talks broke down in early May 2000 with Ethiopia accusing Eritrea of imposing \\"unacceptable conditions\\". On 12 May Ethiopia launched a massive combined arms offensive on multiple fronts involving four armored divisions and 22 infantry divisions, extensive artillery, and close air support. The Ethiopians used pack animals such as donkeys for logistical support for their infantry, and due to their cumbersome logistical chain, primarily relied on infantry assaults to capture Eritrean positions and held their tanks in reserve, then brought forward the tanks to secure positions they had captured. Ethiopian forces struggled to exploit the gaps they had tore in the Eritrean positions, often at great cost in frontal assaults against Eritrean trenches.https://books.google.co.il/books?id=A32pDwAAQBAJ&source;=gbs_navlinks_s The Ethiopians broke through the Eritrean lines between Shambuko and Mendefera, crossed the Mareb River, and cut the road between Barentu and Mendefera, the main supply line for Eritrean troops on the western front of the fighting. Ethiopian sources stated that on 16 May Ethiopian aircraft attacked targets between Areza and Maidema and between Barentu and Omohager, and that all aircraft returned to base, while heavy ground fighting continued in the Da'se and Barentu area and in Maidema. The next day Ethiopian ground forces with air support captured Da'se. Barentu was taken in a surprise Ethiopian pincer movement on the Western front. The Ethiopians attacked a mined but lightly defended mountain, resulting in the capture of Barentu and an Eritrean retreat. Fighting also continued in Maidema. Also on 17 May, due to the continuing hostilities, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1298 imposing an arms embargo on both countries. By 23 May Ethiopia claimed that its \\"troops had seized vital command posts in the heavily defended Zalambessa area, about south of the Eritrean capital, Asmara\\". But the Eritreans claimed they withdrew from the disputed border town of Zalambessa and other disputed areas on the central front as a goodwill' gesture to revive peace talks\\" and claimed it was a 'tactical retreat' to take away one of Ethiopia's last remaining excuses for continuing the war; a report from Chatham House observes, \\"the scale of Eritrean defeat was apparent when Eritrea unexpectedly accepted the OAU peace framework.\\" Having recaptured most of the contested territories—and having heard that the Eritrean government would withdraw from any other territories it occupied at the start of fighting in accordance with a request from the OAU—on 25 May 2000, Ethiopia declared the war was over. By the end of May 2000, Ethiopia occupied about a quarter of Eritrea's territory, displacing 650,000 people and destroying key components of Eritrea's infrastructure. =Regional destabilisation= The fighting also spread to Somalia as both governments tried to outflank one another. The Eritrean government began supporting the Oromo Liberation Front,Staff.

On website of Bradford University citing The Financial Times 9 June 1999 Ethiopia retaliated by supporting groups in southern Somalia who were opposed to Aidid, and by renewing relations with the Islamic regime in Sudan—which is accused of supporting the Eritrean Islamic Salvation, a Sudan-based group that had launched attacks in the Eritrea–Sudan border region—while also lending support to various Eritrean rebel groups including a group known as the Eritrean Islamic Jihad.The Somali connection BBC 23 July 1999Angel Rabasa, et al., Beyond al-Qaeda: Part 2, The Outer Rings of the Terrorist Universe RAND Project AIR FORCE RAND Corporation pp. 82–85 online pp. 44–47 hardcopy =Casualties, displacement and economic disruption= Eritrea claimed that 19,000 Eritrean soldiers were killed during the conflict;Eritrean KIA *Eritrea reveals human cost of war BBC, 20 June 2001 *A Statistical Report of Eritrea's Casualties in the Eritrea–Ethiopia Border War (1998–2000) published by Awate Foundation , P.O.

All these figures have been contested and other news reports simply state that \\"tens of thousands\\" or \\"as many as 100,000\\" were killed in the war. Eritrea accused Ethiopia of using \\"human waves\\" to defeat Eritrean trenches. But according to a report by The Independent, there were no \\"human waves\\" because Ethiopian troops instead outmaneuvered and overpowered the Eritrean trenches.Peter Biles, Eritrean disaster looms as a million flee from rapidly advancing Ethiopian forces, The Independent, 20 May 2000. The fighting led to massive internal displacement in both countries as civilians fled the war zone.

On the Eritrean side, around 7,500 Ethiopians living in Eritrea were interned, and thousands of others were deported. Thousands more remain in Eritrea, many of whom are unable to pay the 1,000 Birr tax on Ethiopians relocating to Ethiopia. According to Human Rights Watch, detainees on both sides were subject in some cases to torture, rape, or other degrading treatment. The economies of both countries were already weak as a result of decades of cold-war politics, civil war and drought. The war exacerbated these problems, resulting in food shortages. Prior to the war, much of Eritrea's trade was with Ethiopia, and much of Ethiopia's foreign trade relied on Eritrean roads and ports. Aftermath =Cessation of hostilities= On 18 June 2000, the parties agreed to a comprehensive peace agreement and binding arbitration of their disputes under the Algiers Agreement. On 31 July 2000, Unites Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1312 and a 25-kilometer-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) was established within Eritrea, patrolled by the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) from over 60 countries.

Horn rivals reject border plans, BBC, 21 November 2006 Both nations have been accused of supporting dissidents and armed opposition groups against each other. John Young, a Canadian analyst and researcher for IRIN, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs news agency, reported that \\"the military victory of the EPRDF (Ethiopia) that ended the Ethiopia–Eritrea War, and its occupation of a swath of Eritrean territory, brought yet another change to the configuration of armed groups in the borderlands between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Asmara replaced Khartoum as the leading supporter of anti-EPRDF armed groups operating along the frontier\\". However, Ethiopia is also accused of supporting rebels opposed to the Eritrean government. At the November 2007 deadline, some analysts feared the restart of the border war but the date passed without any conflict.Peter Heinlein. On the possibility of war restarting , Voice of America, 17 December 2007 There were many reasons why war did not resume. Former U.S. Ambassador David Shinn said both Ethiopia and Eritrea were in a bad position. Many fear the weak Eritrean economy is not improving like those of other African nations while others say Ethiopia is bogged down in Mogadishu. David Shinn said Ethiopia has \\"a very powerful and so far disciplined national army that made pretty short work of the Eritreans in 2000 and the Eritreans have not forgotten that.\\" But he stated Ethiopia is not interested in war because America would condemn Ethiopia if it initiated the war saying \\"I don't think even the US could sit by and condone an Ethiopian initiated attack on Eritrea.\\" =Arbitration through the Permanent Court of Arbitration= As decided in the Algiers Agreement, the two parties presented their cases at the Permanent Court of Arbitration to two different Commissions: In July 2001 the Commission sat to decide its jurisdiction, procedures and possible remedies. The result of this sitting was issued on August 2001. In October 2001, following consultations with the Parties, the Commission adopted its Rules of Procedure. In December 2001 the Parties filed their claims with the Commission. The claims filed by the Parties relate to such matters as the conduct of military operations in the front zones, the treatment of POWs and of civilians and their property, diplomatic immunities and the economic impact of certain government actions during the conflict. At the end of 2005 final awards have been issued on claims on Pensions, and Ports. Partial awards have been issued for claims about: Prisoners of War, the Central Front, Civilians Claims, the Western and Eastern Fronts, Diplomatic, Economic and property losses, and Jus Ad Bellum. The Ethiopia–Eritrean claim committee ruled that: Christine Gray, in an article in the European Journal of International Law (2006), questioned the jurisdiction of the Commission making such an award, because \\"there were many factors which suggested that the Commission should have abstained from giving judgment\\". For example, the hearing of this claim, according to the Algiers agreement was to be heard by a separate commission and to be an investigation of exclusively factual concern not compensation. = 2018 Peace Agreement = The Ethiopian government under the leadership of new prime minister Abiy Ahmed unexpectedly announced on 5 June 2018 that it fully accepts the terms of the peace Algiers Agreement (2000). Ethiopia also announced that it would accept the outcome of the 2002 UN-backed Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission (EEBC) ruling which awarded disputed territories including the town of Badme to Eritrea. Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki noted the “positive signals”. Eritrea Foreign Minister Osman Saleh led the first Eritrean delegation to Ethiopia in almost two decades when he visited Addis Ababa in late June 2018. At a summit in July 2018 in Asmara, Eritrea's President Isaias Afeerki and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed signed a joint declaration formally ending the state of war between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Following the peace agreement, on July 18, 2018, after twenty years Ethiopian Airlines restarted its operations to Eritrea. Flight ET0312 left Bole International Airport to Asmara. The Ethiopian Prime minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts. In an interview made on February 7, 2020, between the country's major national media outlets, Eritrean TV and Dimtsi Hafash Radio Program, with President Isaias Afwerki, the president expressed uncertainty in finalizing the peace agreement processes. He said the condition in Badme has been heightened in the past months. Even though the decisions were made favoring Eritrea to gain the disputed land, the “bankrupt clique,” the president referring to small group of people who control the regional power near Badme, demand further conflict in order to change the decision. Therefore, according to the Eritrean president, the situation in Badme has aggravated and might lead to additional future conflicts. Timeline: Continuing border conflicts Eritrea (green) and Ethiopia (orange) On 19 June 2008 the BBC published a time line (which they update periodically) of the conflict and reported that the \\"Border dispute rumbles on\\": In August 2009, Eritrea and Ethiopia were ordered to pay each other compensation for the war. In March 2011, Ethiopia accused Eritrea of sending bombers across the border. In April, Ethiopia acknowledged that it was supporting rebel groups inside Eritrea. In July, a United Nations Monitoring Group accused Eritrea of being behind a plot to attack an African Union summit in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, in January 2011. Eritrea stated the accusation was a total fabrication. In January 2012, five European tourists were killed and another two were kidnapped close to the border with Eritrea in the remote Afar Region in Ethiopia. In early March the kidnappers announced that they had released the two kidnapped Germans. On 15 March, Ethiopian ground forces attacked Eritrean military posts that they stated were bases in which Ethiopian rebels, including those involved in the January kidnappings, were trained by the Eritreans.

She was built in 1952 as a passenger liner, and successively served as a cruise ship, hospital ship, troop ship and stores ship. She was laid up in 1985 and scrapped in 1992. Passenger liner Barclay Curle and Company of Whiteinch, Glasgow built Uganda for the British-India Steam Navigation Company (BI). She was a passenger and cargo liner with capacity for 167 first class and 133 tourist class passengers and of cargo. Her original tonnages were , and . Wallsend Slipway & Engineering Company built her two Parsons steam turbines, which between them developed 12,300 shp. Uganda was launched on 15 January 1952, completed six months later and made her sea trials on 16 July. On trial she achieved a top speed of , but in service she normally cruised at . Her route was between London and East Africa, calling at Gibraltar, Naples, Port Said, Aden, Mombasa, Dar-es-Salaam, Tanga and Beira. Increasing competition from civil aviation reduced the market for passenger sailings between Britain and East Africa, leading BI to withdraw Uganda from the route in 1967. Cruise ship house flag BI had Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft of Hamburg refit Uganda to an educational cruise ship. Decks were inserted in her former cargo holds, which were converted into dormitory cabins with a total of 920 berths. The conversion raised her passenger capacity from 300 to 1,226 and cost £2.8 million. It increased her gross and net tonnages to but the loss of cargo capacity reduced her deadweight tonnage to . In her new rôle Uganda sailed her first voyage on 27 February 1968. On 21 October 1969 while she was cruising in the North Atlantic in international waters off Cape Trafalgar a Spanish shore battery opened fire. Several shells landed within of the ship. Uganda continued for 14 years cruising mainly Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, together with her company consort . In 1971 Ugandas management and operation were transferred to P&O;'s Passenger Division. In 1972 P&O; absorbed its BI subsidiary and Ugandas ownership. However, uniquely within the P&O; fleet, Uganda retained her BI livery of white hull with a black band and black funnel with two white bands. Nevasa was larger and more modern than Uganda but also more expensive to run. In 1974 she was withdrawn and scrapped, leaving Uganda as the fleet's only educational cruise ship. Falklands service In 1982 Uganda was a hospital ship in the Falklands War with the call sign of \\"Mother Hen\\". She was called up for military duty while on cruise 276 and discharged her 315 cabin passengers and 940 school children, who were on an educational cruise, in Naples. When Uganda docked in Naples, reporters turned up their microphones to hear a ship full of school children singing Rule, Britannia! Uganda had a three-day refit in Gibraltar where a helicopter platform, fittings for replenishment at sea, satellite communications and wards and operating theatres were installed. Two additional water distillers were fitted on the sports deck. In accordance with the Geneva Convention she was painted white and eight red crosses were painted, two on each side of the hull, one facing forward on the bridge superstructure, one on the upper deck visible from the air, and one on either side of her funnel. A team of 136 medical staff including 12 doctors, operating theatre staff and 40 members of the Queen Alexandra's Royal Naval Nursing Service, left Portsmouth to join her taking large quantities of medical supplies with them. The survey vessels , and were converted to ambulance ships to work with Uganda. She received her first casualties on 12 May: wounded men from the Type 42 destroyer . Uganda sailed to and fro between \\"Red Cross Box 2\\" – at position and Middle Bay, taking on casualties, both British and Argentine, transferring those who were well enough to the converted survey ships for passage to Montevideo. On 28 May the land battles started and Uganda anchored in Grantham Sound, 11 miles northwest of Goose Green, where casualties from both sides arrived by helicopter and were treated. By 31 May she had 132 casualties aboard. Uganda co-ordinated the movements of the three British and three Argentine ambulance ships , and . She conducted 504 surgical operations, treated 730 casualties including 150 Argentinians, and made four rendezvous with the Argentine ships. In deference to the TV series M*A*S*H she was nicknamed NOSH - Naval Ocean- going Surgical Hospital. By 10 July her role as a hospital ship was over and the crew held a party for 92 Falkland children more in keeping with her peacetime role. On 13 July Uganda was deregistered as a hospital ship and the red crosses were painted out. Two days later she went back to Grantham Sound, to embark the men of the 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles and their equipment, before sailing for the UK on 18 July. She arrived at Southampton on 9 August 1982, 113 days after she had sailed to join the Task Force. In this time she had sailed 26,150 miles, consumed 4,700 tons of fuel, received more than 1,000 helicopter landings on her flight deck and 3,111 personnel had been transferred to or from her. Smiths Shiprepairers of North Shields extensively refitted Uganda, but her games deck windows never did close properly again after having Sea King helicopters landing on her quoits court. She returned to educational cruising on 25 September 1982, but in November she was chartered for two years to serve as a store ship between Ascension Island and the Falkland Islands. She was fitted with a new helicopter deck and on 14 January 1983 left Southampton for the Falklands again. Uganda was refitted again at Falmouth in November 1983. She completed her charter in 1985, reached Falmouth on 25 April and was laid up in the River Fal on 4 May. Triton On 29 April 1986 the Triton Shipping Company of St Vincent bought Uganda and renamed her Triton. With a crew of 21 she left the Fal on 20 May and anchored off Kaohsiung in Taiwan on 15 July to await breaking. On 22 August Typhoon Wayne drove her ashore. She was still ashore on her side in March 1992, but has since been broken up. In Popular Culture In 1970 Uganda was used in the Children Foundation Film All at Sea. In 1981, she featured in The Two Ronnies serial Band Of Slaves.

Latin American Friends are concentrated in Bolivia and Central America. Most of these Friends are evangelical and are affiliated with Evangelical Friends Church International. Friends World Committee for Consultation organizes among them through the Comité de Amigos Latinoamericanos CoAL del Comité Mundial de Consulta de Los Amigos CMCA FWCC.  Bolivia and southern South America  There are about 30,000 Friends in Bolivia. Quakerism came to Bolivia in 1919 through a Navajo man, William Abel, who sold Bibles and preached in the capital city of La Paz. Bolivian Juan Ayllón became convinced of the truth of the preacher's message and went to study at the Friends' Biblical Institute in Guatemala. After graduating in 1924 he returned and began the Evangelical Friends Church. This yearly meeting, now INELA-BOLIVIA, Iglesia Nacional Evangélica de Los Amigos, consists of 192 congregations throughout Bolivia and sponsors several schools. Also during 1919 the Holiness Friends Mission, an association of independent Indiana Friends, established meetings in Bolivia's northern Andes surrounding Sorata village. When the mission reorganized as Central Friends Mission in 1952 the Bolivian meetings divided into two Yearly Meetings— ' (Bolivian Friends YM), and Holiness Friends ('). At first, Bolivian Yearly Meetings consisted only of members of Aymara heritage. Aymara Friends are now working among Quechua, Moseten, Chimane, and other indigenous groups. Yearly Meetings include Iglesia Evangélica Amigos Central (semi- programmed congregations in the Friends Church related to Central YM), Iglesia Evangélica Unión Boliviana \\"Amigos\\" (Bolivian Union Evangelical Friends Church), Iglesia Nacional Evangélica Los Amigos de Bolivia (National Evangelical Friends Church of Bolivia) or INELA-Bolivia, and Iglesia Evangélica Misión Boliviana de Santidad Amigos (Bolivian Evangelical Mission of Holiness Friends Church). In Peru there are about 5,000 Friends; they are a part of INELA-Perú Iglesia Nacional Evangélica Los Amigos del Perú (National Evangelical Friends Church of Peru), an outgrowth of INELA-Bolivia. This church has grown through extensive youth outreach. Bolivian Friends are also supporting missions in northwest Argentina, especially among indigenous people there. Two other small Friends groups exist in Bolivia: Iglesia Nacional Evangélica 'Estrella de Belén, Iglesia Nacional Evangélica 'Seminario Bíblico are beginning to cooperate with the other Yearly Meetings.  Central America and other Latin American countries There are approximately 20,000 Friends in the nation of Guatemala. Missions from California and Oregon YM early in the 20th century led to the founding of Central America Yearly Meeting, with headquarters at Chiquimula. Due to the closing of borders because of war conditions, and because of theological distinctions, the Chiquimula Yearly Meeting formed daughter Yearly Meetings: Iglesia Nacional 'Los Amigos' de Guatemala (National Evangelical Friends Church of Guatemala), the official successor, Iglesia Evangélica Embajadores Amigos (Friends Ambassadors Evangelical Church) (a Monthly Meeting with several preparative meetings that functions as a Yearly Meeting), and ' (Holiness Friends Yearly Meeting). There is also Guatemala Monthly Meeting, a small unprogrammed meeting affiliated with Pacific Yearly Meeting (meetings alternating between Guatemala capital and Guatemala Antigua), which operates PROGRESA (formerly Guatemala Friends Scholarship Program), an educational program at the high school and university level serving primarily highlands indigenous communities. (This last was laid down in 2018, according to.https://www.pacificyearlymeeting.org/monthly- meetings-and-worship-groups/) Honduras Yearly Meeting of the Friends Church was formed from the eastern missions of CA YM. In the 1950s an agreement among North American missionaries abandoned Tegucigalpa and nearby meetings and is concentrated around San Pedro Sula, Santa Rosa de Copán and San Marcos Ocotepeque, where there is a school/seminary. Tegucigalpa Friends Church has returned to the YM. In El Salvador there are about 550 Friends, members of ' (Friends Evangelical Church YM in El Salvador). They have a number of congregations and YM offices in Soyopango, a suburb of San Salvador. Recently the YM has taken on the project of promoting \\"Proyecto Alternativas a la Violencia\\" PAV (AVP - the Alternatives to Violence Project) There are also about 72 Friends in Costa Rica. Monteverde Monthly Meeting was founded as a colony by a group of young Conservative Friends families in 1952, trying to find a place that was not militaristic. Many of the men in the group had been incarcerated in the United States as conscientious objectors and they were attracted when Costa Rica abolished its army. El Centro de Los Amigos para la Paz, with a small hostel, was founded as a community center and a home for San José Quakers' unprogrammed silent worship in the 1980s. Mexico has about 800 Friends in two meetings—the Asociación Religiosa de las Iglesias Evangélicas de los Amigos (the yearly meeting of the Religious Association of the Friends Evangelical Churches EFCI) and the Reunion General de los Amigos en México (General Meeting of Friends in Mexico), which meets sesquiannually (every 18 months), comprising several churches around Ciudad Victoria monthly meeting (founded by missions from FUM), and Mexico City Monthly Meeting, affiliated with Pacific Yearly Meeting, an open worship, liberal meeting in the Mexican capital. They manage the Casa de Los Amigos in Mexico DF, which has numerous programs, including refugee support. There are similar groups in Sonora as well. A new evangelical mission is forming as . There are about 373 Friends in Cuba. They are members of Cuba Yearly Meeting (\\"\\"), which is affiliated with Friends United Meeting. The first MMs in Banes and Gibara were begun in 1904. All but one of the 11 monthly meetings are in former Oriente province, around Holguín. Also in Cuba there was a small unprogrammed group in Havana starting in 1994, which spread silent worship across the Island; there were unprogrammed groups in Holguin for two years, one in Santiago de Cuba and in Santi Spiritus for a while, but all have been laid down. Looking at their missionary heritage and developing their Quaker roots while seeking to develop a Cuban Quakerism in the rapidly changing national environment, the YM founded the Cuban Quaker Peace Institute, \\"Instituto Cuáquero Cubano de Paz\\" in Gibara in 2013, with courses promoting the Quaker Testimonies and peace-building. After the Conference of Friends in the Americas in 1977, Latino Friends got to know each other and FWCC began an effort to help them organize. This led to the founding of CoAL in Mexico City in 1982. EFCI also began trying to bring all the Evangelical mission church YMs of the region into a region of their denomination, as well as other programmed Quakers. Today pastoral and Evangelical Friends in Latin America are in regular contact, but they are only slowly constructing links to one another. There have been unprogrammed worship meetings and groups in Latin America for several years, the oldest and most permanent in Costa Rica and Mexico; the majority of the others are expatriates' worship groups plus about 20 in Colombia, Bogotá Monthly Meeting. Unprogrammed Friends in Latin America had their first meeting in November 2006 in Monteverde, Costa Rica.

Rusty Brown's only friend throughout his life is Chalky White. White is also a collector of G.I. Joe and other action figures, but gives up collecting as he grows up, gets married, and starts a family, unlike his friend Rusty, who remains locked in a permanent manchild state, always looking for elements of his lost childhood like lunchboxes, Funny Face drink cups, and more. A recurring theme in the series is Rusty's greedy, egocentric, and bold behavior opposed to Chalky's kind, timid, and often naïve nature. Rusty is often utilizing tricks to swindle Chalky of his action figures, while Chalky, being highly gullible, is never able to see through Rusty's true nature.

A supplement, With One Voice (WOV), contains additional hymns and service music. The LBW is sometimes called the \\"green book\\", as opposed to With One Voice, which is bound in blue; or Service Book and Hymnal, which is bound in red; or The Lutheran Hymnal, which is also bound in red, with a simple gold cross.  History  When Lutheran churches were first established in North America, the immigrants from Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and other non-English-speaking countries retained services in their native languages. However, as the children and grandchildren of these immigrants began speaking English in their everyday lives and the various Lutheran denominations began uniting, many felt that the North American Lutheran churches needed a common English-language liturgy and hymns. Although the eighteenth-century missionary Henry Melchior Muhlenberg had hoped for the day when Lutherans would be \\"one church [with] one book\\", it was not until the 1888 \\"Common Service\\" that a majority of English-speaking Lutherans in North America began to use the same texts for worship, albeit with minor adaptations. (Senn, 584-591.) The \\"Common Liturgy\\" included in the 1958 Service Book and Hymnal was a major revision of the \\"Common Service\\", and introduced a Eucharistic Prayer into American Lutheran usage. Culto Cristiano, a 1964 service book, attempted to offer a unified liturgy for Spanish-speaking Lutherans. The process leading to the publication of the LBW was started in 1965 when the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) invited other North American Lutheran denominations to join it to work on a common service book. Together with the LCMS, the Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Canada formed the Inter- Lutheran Commission on Worship to undertake this project. The commission conducted its work through four sub-committees: Liturgical Text Committee, Liturgical Music Committee, Hymn Text Committee, Hymn Music Committee. The work of the committees was validated via provisional liturgical and hymn materials, questionnaires, conferences, and dialogs. The Rev. Dr. Eugene Brand was named project director for the development work and The Rev. Leonard Flachman was named publishers' representative and managing editor. The LBW was published in 1978. The LCMS pulled out of the ILCW just prior to the publication of the LBW, but having been a participant in the development of the materials its name appears on the title page. The LCMS published its own hymnal, Lutheran Worship (LW), in 1982. Although the LW liturgies are very similar to those in the LBW, there are differences which reflect differing theologies. For example, LW lacks the option for a Eucharistic Prayer. The Lutheran Book of Worship has remained in use for thirty years. There are a couple reasons for that longevity. The first is the careful, forward-looking, inclusive work of the ILCW and the four subcommittees. The second is the careful work done by the staff of Augsburg Publishing House in selecting and testing the materials with which the book was manufactured. The books did not wear out. The first printing of the LBW was one million copies and required 19 semi-trailers to carry the book from the printer to 14 distribution points around the United States. While it is in its twenty-seventh printing and widely used by the ELCA and the ELCIC, the LBW was replaced in October 2006 as the primary worship resource in the two denominations by Evangelical Lutheran Worship. The new book is intended to reflect the changing demographic of the church bodies and the subsequent changes in language and ritual practice.

Its namesake is the city's Powderhorn Park facility in the northwestern part of the neighborhood around Powderhorn Lake, which contains playing fields, playgrounds and a park building that hosts community education classes ranging from pottery to yoga. In winter, the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board sets up a portable warming house and the lake is used for ice skating. Developed mainly between 1905 and 1920, it is a residential area consisting of single-family homes, duplexes, and three-story brick apartment buildings. Approximately 9,000 people live in Powderhorn Park. According to the 2000 Census, 42% of the population is white, 22% each black and Hispanic, and 5% each Asian and Native American. Along Lake Street, numerous new and existing Hispanic and African businesses show the area's diversity. The neighborhood belongs Minneapolis City Council Ward 9, currently represented by Alondra Cano. The park and lake are used as the setting for the last act in the city's annual May Day parade (actually occurring on the first Sunday in May), which is a play in motion that has been put on by the In the Heart of the Beast Puppet and Mask Theatre since 1975. As the parade runs south along Bloomington Avenue, participants wear a variety of costumes, and many manipulate giant puppets, all to produce a story that is based on sociopolitical themes including peace, environmentalism, current events, and others. After the parade story ends, the tail end of the parade is a \\"free speech\\" section which includes representatives of community groups and campaigning politicians. After the parade, there is an intermission as people gather on a hillside at the west end of the park for the Tree of Life ceremony. Many details of the final act change from year to year, but there are several figures that consistently appear: River, Woods, Prairie, Sky, Sun, and the Tree of Life. At the end of the ceremony, a flotilla comes across the lake with the Sun figure in the central boat. The Sun awakens the Tree of Life (a figure which includes a traditional maypole), and the crowd sings \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" to mark the banishment of another season of winter. In 2009, a group of residents started the Powderhorn365 program that documents the day-to-day life of the neighborhood, through a daily photograph from the neighborhood. In May 2020, the neighborhood was the location of the killing of George Floyd. In response, residents of the neighborhood have vowed not to call the police, \\"doing so, they believed, would add to the pain that black residents of Minneapolis were feeling and could put them in danger.\\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/minneapolis-george-floyd- police.html Since then, a camp for those experiencing homelessness has been established in Powderhorn Park, with many tents and over 300 residents.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/minneapolis-george-floyd- police.html While community members have complained about the camp (which has brought increased vehicle traffic, drugs, property damage, and at least two overdoses) and changed their behavior to avoid it, many remain committed to not involving the police. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/minneapolis- george-floyd-police.html Instead, community members have delivered meals, medical care, and counseling and sought support from the American Indian Movement to monitor the area.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/us/minneapolis-george-floyd- police.html Notable residents * Alison Bechdel, cartoonist * Peter Gross, comic book artist and writer  References  External links *Minneapolis Neighborhood Profile - Powderhorn Park *Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association *Minnesota Stories: Powderhorn Park (broken link: archived version) *Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board: Powderhorn Park *Powderhorn365 Photography Project *Parks, Lakes, Trails and So Much More, a history of Minneapolis parks (pages 210-215) Neighborhoods in Minneapolis ","title":"Powderhorn Park, Minneapolis"},{"id":"1781251","text":"This is a list of Queen's University Belfast people including notable alumni and staff of Queen's University Belfast, Northern Ireland.

The municipality, including the city, covers an area of 244.84 km² and as of 2007 has a population of 110,511 people. Situated near the Guatemalan border, it is the westernmost city in the country and is the center of an agricultural region producing primarily coffee. Ahuachapán is the site of a geothermal power plant and a hydroelectric station. The local geothermal activity produces many steam vents, visible throughout the surrounding mountains. Among other things, Ahuachapan is also the birthplace of notable Salvadoran poet Alfredo Espino and is about an hour's drive from the national wildlife park El Imposible. History Ahuachapán was founded by Mayan Indians of the Poqomam tribe in the 5th century, and was invaded in the 15th century by the Izalcos people. It officially gained city status in El Salvador on 11 February 1862 and became the departmental capital on 9 February 1869. Geography The municipality of Ahuachapán is located 100 km from the capital city San Salvador. To the north it borders San Lorenzo and the Republic of Guatemala. It is surrounded by San Lorenzo, Atiquizaya and Turín; by Juayúa, Apaneca, and Tacuba to the south.

The castle was important both militarily and as a symbol of Llywelyn's power and authority. The castle features a large stone keep, which historian Richard Avent considers \\"the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower\\". In 1284 Dolbadarn was taken by Edward I, who removed some of its timbers to build his new castle at Caernarfon. The castle was used as a manor house for some years, before falling into ruin. In the 18th and 19th century it was a popular destination for painters interested in Sublime and Picturesque landscapes. It is now owned by Cadw and managed as a tourist attraction, and is protected as a grade I listed building. History =1220–40= Dolbadarn Castle was built in either the 1220s or the 1230s by Llywelyn the Great, at the base of the Llanberis Pass, overlooking the lake of Llyn Padarn in northern Wales.Avent, p.12. Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles, instead using undefended palaces called ', or courts.Avent, p.3. From the late 11th century onwards, the Normans had advanced into Wales, taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches. During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built, but in small numbers.Avent, p.4. Plan of the castle: A – South Tower; B – Keep; C – West Tower; D – East Building; E – Hall Llywelyn the Great initially controlled the princedom of Gwynedd, but grew more powerful over the course of his reign, extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century.Avent, p.6. Llywelyn was faced by several challenges, including dealing with the threat from the kings of England, and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh.Avent, p.7. As part of this strategy, Llywelyn built Castell y Bere, an innovative stone Welsh castle, in the 1220s.Avent, p.8. Shortly afterwards he began the first phases of Dolbadarn Castle, constructing the initial stone fortifications on the site, including two square stone towers.Avent, p.12; Butler, p.31 The location of the castle was important both because it controlled an important mountain pass, and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as the lord of the mountains and coasts of Wales: several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind.Butler, p.29. It is also possible that Llywelyn may have built his castle on top of the remains of a previous fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd, a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century, although no such remains have been found.Castell Dolbadarn, Llanberis, Gwynedd Archaeological Trust, Regional Historic Environment Record, accessed 22 October 2011. As part of his strategy for dealing with the Marcher Lords, Llywelyn married his eldest son, Dafydd, to Isabella, the daughter of William de Braose, a powerful lord in Brecon, Builth and Abergavenny. The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls. Following Dafydd's marriage, Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn, probably in the 1240s, adding these elements to the existing castle.Avent, pp.7, 12. The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology, but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south.Avent, p.12; Crouch, p.278. Traditionally the surrounding district of Is Gwyrfai had been run from the town of Llanbeblig; after the 1240s, this role was transferred to Dolbadarn.Avent, p.12. =1240–1300= The keep, seen across the hall and courtyard Following Llywelyn's death in 1240, Gwynedd's power declined and many of its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247.Avent, p.14. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Owain was eventually released in 1277 and there has been much historical debate over which castle he was held in. Hywel Foel ap Griffri wrote a famous poem describing Owain's long imprisonment in a round tower; historians believe that this refers to the keep at Dolbardarn.Avent, pp.14–15. The conflict between the Welsh princes and the English kings continued in the reign of Edward I. In 1282 Llywelyn fought a final campaign against Edward, ending in the prince's death near Builth that December.Avent, p.16. His brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd, assumed power but during 1283 was forced south into Snowdonia and by May his government was based from Dolbadarn Castle. Edward deployed 7,000 troops to detain Dafydd who was finally captured and executed in October; Dolbadarn was occupied by Norman forces. Edward was determined to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales and set about building a sequence of new castles and walled towns, replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon.Avent, p.20. Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle was being used by the Normans for the construction of Caernarfon Castle. This was both a practical and a symbolic action, demonstrating Norman power over one of the most important possessions of the Welsh princes. =14th – 21st centuries= J. M. W. Turner's painting Dolbadarn Castle, 1800. \\"Dolbadarn Castle, Llanberis, Wales\\", ca. 1890 - 1900. The remaining parts of the castle continued to be used as a manor house into the 14th century. By the 18th century, however, Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited.Avent, p.21. From the 1760s onwards, however, it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque.Avent, p.22. Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground, allowing the viewer's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist, to create a more striking or dramatic effect.Avent, p.22; Andrews, p.135. J. M. W. Turner's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back-lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous, but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period. In 1941 the castle was given to the State by Sir Michael Duff. It is now maintained by Cadw and is protected as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument. In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes, the history of Dolbadarn Castle and similar Welsh castles has become increasing prominent. In response, Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes.Jones, pp.200–201. Architecture The castle seen from the north-west, showing (near to far) the hall, the courtyard, the west tower, the east building, the keep and the south tower Dolbadarn Castle comprises a courtyard, surrounded by a number of towers and a round keep.Avent, p.31. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar, with the exception of the keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15 feet (5 m) high, it is now only at most 3 feet (1 m) high.Avent, p.33. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.Avent, p.35. The keep today is 46 feet (14 m) high and is modelled on early 13th-century English round towers built in the south of the Welsh Marches.Avent, pp.11, 31; King, p.135. As with other Welsh-constructed towers, the entrance is on the first storey, not at ground level; it may originally have been protected by a porch. The keep had a portcullis which would have been drawn up past the window on the second storey of the tower.Avent, p.32-33. While the castle's flooring has long since disappeared, its interior staircase to the upper storey may still be climbed.Avent, p.32. This second storey would have formed the main chamber in the keep and had a large fireplace and a latrine. Originally the keep would have had a parapet and battlements, since destroyed. Historian Richard Avent considers it \\"the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower\\".Avent, p.11. The rectangular west tower was a relatively short defensive structure, designed to protect the more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle. At the north end of the castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an additional building, probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century.Avent, p.34. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27 feet (15 by 8 m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time, where a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common.Crouch, p.278; Emery, p.660.

Failure to do so is normally taken as a signal of a lack of confidence in the leadership of the faction or party, since it should be possible in a well-run organization to find someone willing to at least run for a job they are not fit to perform, to show solidarity. Major political parties tend to be able to take a full slate for granted: all the positions they run for, they have some chance of winning, and the party is well-funded, and people can gain contacts and prestige from running for that party. It will likewise have even less of a problem filling its internal roles. While a minor political party may have little trouble filling its own officer positions or Shadow Cabinet, these deploying the little power it has, it will likely have much more trouble offering candidates for every legislative position in every electoral district. The so-called \\"parachute candidates\\" who run for election in a district that is not their own home nor where they necessarily have close ties, are always a means to achieve a full slate or close to it. This demonstrates solidarity and allows people to vote for a party but is not typically understood as a serious offering for the person to take the job. It is considered to be a highly questionable practice by most who advocate electoral reform, in part to get rid of any necessity to engage in such tricks. In some countries, states, provinces or territories, running a full slate seems to be a pre-requisite for media coverage or participation in a televised leaders' debate such as the United States presidential election debates. In a presidential system like the United States there are other nomination rules, ballot access and media access issues but being able to run in every U.S. electoral district and \\"on the ballot\\" in every state, is certainly one of the signs of being a \\"major\\" party.

It was one of Presley's final acting roles, along with the same year's Change of Habit. It is based on the 1960 novel Chautauqua by Day Keene and Dwight Vincent Babcock. Plot In a small Iowa town in 1927, a traveling Chautauqua company arrives, with internal squabbles dividing the troupe. The new manager, Walter Hale (Elvis Presley), is trying to prevent Charlene, the troupe's \\"Story Lady\\" (Marlyn Mason), from recruiting the performers to form a union. Meanwhile, the town has a scandal following the murder of the local pharmacist Wilby (Dabney Coleman). Although a shady gambler is arrested, Walter realizes that the real killer is Nita (Sheree North), one of Wilby's employees. Walter successfully gets Nita to confess during a Chautauqua performance, where she makes public the sexual harassment that Wilby directed at her. Nita's self-defense plea frees the wrongly jailed man, but Charlene is outraged that Walter used the crime to financially enrich the Chautauqua, and attempts to quit. Walter attempts to reason with Charlene, but when she refuses to give in, he deceives her and uses the local police force to be sure that she must leave on the train with the rest of the troupe.

Production and release =Development= In June 1959 it was announced that Don Mankiewicz would write a screenplay of an unpublished story by Mauri Grashin, Day Keene, and Dwight Babcock. By December 1960, with the project titled Chautauqua, MGM was ready to make the film with Glenn Ford. Rumours circulating in Hollywood at the time stated that Presley would co-star with Ford, Hope Lange, and Arthur O'Connell, but nothing came of it and the film was shelved. In 1964, Dick Van Dyke had been signed up to star in a film titled Chautauqua based on a book called Morally We Roll Along by Gay MacLaren.The name of the book is incorrectly given as \\" _Merrily_ We Roll Along\\" in After several years of failed screenplays and cast changes, MGM sold the rights to Columbia Pictures in May 1965. Columbia also struggled to get the project off the ground, and in April 1968 sold the rights back to MGM. This time MGM lined up Presley to star and production began in the fall of 1968. Chautauqua was the working title, but it was later changed to The Trouble with Girls when the producers worried that audiences would not understand the title or be able to pronounce it. =Filming= Elvis Presley was paid $850,000 plus 50% of the profits.Michael A. Hoey, Elvis' Favorite Director: The Amazing 52-Film Career of Norman Taurog, Bear Manor Media 2013 Production ran from October 28 to December 18, 1968. Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager, originally wanted actress Jean Hale for the female lead, but Marlyn Mason was cast at the insistence of director Peter Tewksbury. Ironically, Jean Hale's husband, Dabney Coleman, would later be cast. The Trouble with Girls was released as the bottom half of a double feature, sharing the screen with the Raquel Welch drama Flareup. =Reception= The Trouble with Girls (and How to Get into It) performed poorly in cinemas but strongly on the drive-in circuit. Roger Greenspun of The New York Times called it \\"a charming though ineptly titled comedy\\" with Presley performing \\"a reasonably developed characterization as the chautauqua company manager, and he sings very well.\\"Greenspun, Roger (December 11, 1969). \\"Trouble With Girls\\". The New York Times. 63. Variety wrote, \\"Elvis Presley is lost in this one. Without star’s usual assortment of 10 to 12 songs, and numbers cut down to a bare three, picture has little to offer. Title suggests a gay comedy but it’s a mass of contrived melodramatics and uninteresting performances that do not jell into anything but program fare.\\"\\"Film Reviews: The Trouble With Girls\\". Variety. May 14, 1969. 6. Margaret Harford of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \\"never makes up its mind where to go and how to get there ... The trouble with the picture is not girls; it's indecision by the writers, Arnold and Lois Peyser about whether we should laugh at the corny entertainment of 40-odd years ago, or cry over the troubles of a lonely widow who drinks too much.\\"Harford, Margaret (September 13, 1969). \\"'Trouble With Girls' No. 30 for Presley\\". Los Angeles Times. Part II, p. 7. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"The plot's rather curious blend of amateur theatricals, folksy humour and straight melodrama strains credulity even for a Presley film, and the few songs are instantly forgettable. Vincent Price makes an odd and quite appealing guest appearance as an itinerant lecturer known as Mr. Morality, but Presley himself seems uninterested in the whole affair.\\" While it met with generally poor reviews on release, post Presley’s death critics re-visited the film and started to acknowledge its merits – interesting narrative, strong supporting cast, authentic period feel and innovative filming techniques. Soundtrack Entering the studio for The Trouble with Girls, Presley found himself in the position of knowing he had the goods in the can with his looming comeback television special but given that his last three singles – \\"You'll Never Walk Alone,\\" \\"Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby,\\" \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" – and the Speedway album all tanked, facing a practically dead recording career.Jorgensen pp. 261–262 The soundtrack contained some minor songs, its only distinctive track by Billy Strange, the producer of the session, and Mac Davis. The recording session took place at United Artists Recorders in Hollywood, on October 23, 1968. \\"Clean Up Your Own Backyard\\" by Strange and Davis, their fourth successful submission to a Presley soundtrack in a row, was the only one released concurrently with the film's release, as the single RCA 47-9747 in 1969, peaking at #35 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"Almost\\" would appear in 1970 on the budget album Let's Be Friends, the only other track from the film to be released during Presley's lifetime. His remake of the His Hand in Mine track \\"Swing Down Sweet Chariot\\" would not see release until 1983 on Elvis: A Legendary Performer Volume 4.Jorgensen, pp. 260, 419. The other songs would wait to be issued until RCA's soundtrack compilations of the 1990s combining released songs and outtakes from multiple films on one compact disc.

Cobia (SS-245) was laid down on 17 March 1943 by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 28 November 1943 (sponsored by Mrs. C. W. Magruder), and commissioned on 29 March 1944, Lieutenant Commander Albert L. Becker in command. Cobia was designated a National Historic Landmark for her service in World War II, which included service in the Pacific, where she earned four battle stars. She is now a museum ship at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. World War II =First patrol= Cobia reached Pearl Harbor from New London 3 June 1944. On 26 June, she put to sea on her first war patrol, bound for the Bonin Islands. On 13 July, 17 July, and 18 July she sank Japanese freighters. The last, Nisshu Maru, was a troop transport carrying a Japanese tank regiment to Iwo Jima. Even though casualties were low in the 26th Tank Regiment, all of the regiment's 28 tanks went to the bottom of the sea. It would be December before 22 replacements were provided. On 20 July Cobia sank three small armed ships in a running gun battle. One of them rammed Cobia, causing minor damage, but the submarine continued her mission, sinking a converted yacht of 500 tons on 5 August. A survivor from the yacht was rescued as Cobia's first prisoner of war. =Second and third patrols= After refitting at Majuro from 14 August to 6 September 1944, Cobia sailed into the Luzon Strait for her second war patrol, a mission frequently punctuated by attacks by Japanese aircraft. On 22 October, the sub rescued two survivors of a Japanese ship previously sunk by another American submarine. Cobia put into Fremantle for refit 5 November, and cleared that harbor on her third war patrol 30 November. Sailing into the South China Sea, she reconnoitered off Balabac Strait between 12 December and 8 January 1945, and on 14 January sank the minelayer Yurishima off the southeast coast of Malaya. Surfacing to photograph her sinking victim, Cobia was driven under by a Japanese bomber. Next day she rescued two Japanese from a raft on which they had been adrift 40 days. =Fourth patrol= Once more she refitted at Fremantle (between 24 January and 18 February), then sailed to the Java Sea for her fourth war patrol. On 26 February she engaged two \\"sea trucks\\" . One of the targets resisted with machine gun fire which damaged Cobia's radar equipment and killed Ralph Clark Huston Jr., a 20 mm gun loader and the submarine's only casualty of the war. After sinking both sea trucks, Cobia interrupted her patrol for repairs at Fremantle from 4–8 March, then returned to the Java Sea, where on 8 April she rescued seven surviving crewmembers of a downed Army bomber. One of the crewmembers, Jean Vandruff, recounted the story of the rescue in his autobiography (see external link). =Fifth and sixth patrols= Cobia replenished at Subic Bay from 15 April to 9 May 1945, then put out for the Gulf of Siam and her fifth war patrol. On 14 May she attacked a cargo ship, but was driven deep by depth charges hurled by minelayer Hatsutaka. Her luck changed for the better on 8 June, when Cobia contacted a tanker convoy, and sank both a tanker and the landing craft Hakusa. She refitted once more at Fremantle between 18 June and 18 July, then sailed for her sixth and final war patrol. After landing intelligence teams along the coast of Java on 27 July, Cobia sailed to act as lifeguard during air strikes on Formosa until the end of hostilities, returning to Saipan 22 August. Of Cobia's six war patrols, the first, third, fourth, and fifth were designated as \\"successful\\" war patrols, for which she received four battle stars. She was credited with having sunk a total of 16,835 tons of shipping. Post-war service Cobia sailed on for Pearl Harbor, New York, Washington, and New London, where she was decommissioned and placed in reserve 22 May 1946. Recommissioned 6 July 1951, Cobia trained reservists and Submarine School students at New London until placed in commission in reserve at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard 29 October 1953. After overhaul, she was towed to New London, where she was again placed out of commission in reserve in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet 19 March 1954. By 1959, the Navy considered Cobia obsolete as a deployable warship and transferred her to the Milwaukee, Wisconsin Naval Reserve Center. There she served as a training platform for the next eleven years. She was redesignated an Auxiliary Submarine, AGSS-245, 1 December 1962. On 1 July 1970, the Navy struck Cobia from the Naval Register, and she was towed to Manitowoc, Wisconsin to serve as an international memorial to submariners. In 1986, Cobia was incorporated as a part of the Wisconsin Maritime Museum, declared a National Historic Landmark, and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Cobia is permanently docked at the Manitowoc River's mouth at Lake Michigan, where tours are given daily and overnight trips are available. Ongoing restoration, maintenance, and preservation efforts keep Cobia in remarkably good condition, with many systems operational, including two of the main diesel engines, the radio shack, and the SJ-1 radar, which is considered to be the oldest operating radar set in the world.

George II (, Giorgi II) ( 1054 – 1112), of the Bagrationi Dynasty, was a king of Georgia from 1072 to 1089. He was a son and successor of Bagrat IV and his wife Borena of Alania. Unable to deal effectively with the constant Seljuk Turkish attacks and overwhelmed by internal problems in his kingdom, George was forced to abdicate in favor of his energetic son David IV, to whom he remained a nominal co-ruler until his death in 1112. He also held the high Byzantine titles of curopalates (c. 1060) and caesar (c. 1081). Early reign George’s childhood coincided with the civil war between his father, Bagrat IV (r. 1027–1072), and the rebellious Georgian feudal lord Liparit, who succeeded in temporarily driving Bagrat into the Byzantine Empire, and crowned George as king at the Ruisi cathedral between 1050 and 1053, under the regency of Bagrat's sister Gurandukht. In fact, Liparit became the master of nearly half of the Georgian kingdom and the most powerful dynast in the country. By 1060, Bagrat IV had been able to secure the throne and made George his heir apparent to whom the Byzantine emperor attached the title of curopalates. In 1070, Prince George, at the head of a combined Georgian-Alan army, inflicted a decisive defeat on the Shaddadid emir of Arran, Fadl II, and ravaged his possessions at Ganja. Seljuk invasions Coin of George II, 1081–1089 Charter of King George II of Georgia George succeeded as King of Georgia upon the death of his father in 1072 and received the title of nobelissimos and later that of sebastos from the Byzantine emperor. A year later, he faced a major aristocratic revolt led by Niania Kvabulis-dze, Ivane Liparitis-dze, and Vardan of Svaneti. Although victorious, the king had to buy the rebels’ loyalty through generously awarding them additional estates. Soon, Georgia was attacked again by the Seljuks, a nomadic Turkic people, who would prove to be a major menace to George II’s reign. Following the 1073 devastation of Kartli (central Georgia) by the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan, George successfully repelled an invasion commanded by a Turkish general left by the sultan in charge of the Caucasus. The king also secured the formal return of Upper Tao/Tayk (Theme of Iberia), a frontier region which had been a bone of contention between Georgia and the Byzantine Empire early in the 11th century, by the Byzantine governor, Gregory Pakourianos, who began to evacuate the region shortly after the 1071 disaster inflicted by the Seljuks on the Byzantine army at Manzikert. On this occasion, George was bestowed with the Byzantine title of caesar, granted the fortress of Kars and put in charge of the Imperial Eastern limits. This did not help to stem the Seljuk advance, however. In 1076, the Seljuk sultan Malik Shah I surged into Georgia and reduced many settlements to ruins. Harassed by the massive Turkic influx, known in Georgian history as didi turkoba, or the Great Turkish Invasion, from 1079/80 onward, George was pressured into submitting to Malik-Shah to ensure a precious degree of peace at the price of an annual tribute. George II was even able to garner the Seljuk military support in his campaign aimed at bringing the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, which had long resisted the Bagratid attempts of annexation, within a unified Georgian realm. However, tired with a protracted siege of the Kakhetian stronghold of Vezhini, George abandoned the campaign when snow fell, and headed for the Ajameti forests to ease his disappointment by hunting. The Seljuk auxiliaries also lifted the siege and plundered the fertile Iori Valley in Kakheti. Aghsartan I, king of Kakheti, went to the sultan to declare his submission, and in token of loyalty embraced Islam, thus winning a Seljuk protection against the aspirations of the Georgian crown.Lordkipanidze, Mariam Davydovna; Hewitt, George B. (1987), Georgia in the XI-XII Centuries, pp. 76–78. Ganatleba Publishers: Tbilisi. Deposition George II’s wavering character and incompetent political decisions coupled with the Seljuk yoke brought the Kingdom of Georgia into a profound crisis which climaxed in the aftermath of a disastrous earthquake that struck Georgia in 1088. In 1089, George handed over the crown to his vigorous sixteen-year-old son David. This changeover is shrouded in mystery and is mentioned only in passing in the Georgian chronicles. All that is recorded is that George crowned his son as king with his own hands, after which he disappears from the chronicle. He was most probably forced by his nobles, in a palace coup masterminded by the powerful minister Bishop Giorgi Chkondideli, to abdicate in favor of David. George is mentioned in prayers dated to 1203 as \\"king of kings, and caesar of all the East and West\\", suggesting that he was still alive and given some titles by his reigning son, but exercised no real power.

It is one of the most important secular buildings in Schleswig-Holstein, and has been rebuilt and expanded several times in its over eight hundred years of history, changing from a medieval castle to a Renaissance fortress to a Baroque castle.Dehio: Handbuch der Deutschen Kunstdenkmäler. Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein, p. 800. (German text) It is the ancestral home of the Holstein-Gottorp branch of the House of Oldenburg, from which emerged in the 18th century, among other things, four Swedish kings and several Russian Tsars. It is situated on an island in the Schlei, about 40 km from the Baltic Sea. History Gottorf castle in 1864 Plan of the Neuwerk garden and the \\"Schlossinsel\\", Etching 1743 View from the globe house to the south, pond, figure of Herkules and southern garden terrace It was first settled as an estate in 1161 as the residence of Bishop Occo of Schleswig when his former residence was destroyed. The Danish Duke of Schleswig acquired it through a purchase in 1268, and in 1340 it was transferred to the Count of Holstein at Rendsburg of the House of Schauenburg. The manor later, through maternal inheritance, became the possession of Christian I of Denmark, the first Danish monarch from the House of Oldenburg, in 1459. Both the island and the structure were extended through the years, and particularly during the 16th century. Frederick I, younger son of Christian I, made it his primary residence. In 1544 the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were divided in three parts; Frederick's third son Adolf received one of these parts and made his residence at Gottorp. This state became known as the Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. The estate became a European cultural centre in the reign of Frederick III, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, (1597–1659). The castle was built by the famous Swedish architect Nicodemus Tessin the Younger (1697-1703). After the ducal lineage of Gottorp were forced to move out in 1702, the palace, now occupied by the Danish, fell into disuse and disrepair in 1713 under the reign of Frederick IV of Denmark. Pieces of furniture, art and other interior were gradually moved out of the palace, and the structures were used both as Danish and Prussian barracks in the 19th century. During World War II, the estate was used as a displaced persons camp. Since 1947, the palace has been renovated and restored through a series of initiatives. The restoration was considered complete in 1996. The palace is now owned by a foundation of the State of Schleswig-Holstein and houses the State Art and Cultural History Museum and the State Archeological Museum.

Plattner, Marc F. and Costopoulos, Philip J. World Religions and Democracy. 2005, page 119.( also in PDF file (archived from the original on 13 April 2008), p49), saying \\"Not only do Protestants presently constitute 13 percent of the world's population—about 800 million people—but since 1900 Protestantism has spread rapidly in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\\" The main reason for this wide range is the lack of a common agreement among scholars as to which denominations constitute Protestantism. For instance, most sources but not all include Anabaptism, Anglicanism, Baptists and Independent Nondenominational Christianity as part of Protestantism. Moreover, Protestant denominations altogether do not form a single structure comparable to the Catholic Church, or to a lesser extent the Eastern Orthodox Communion. However, several different comparable communions exist within Protestantism, such as the Anglican Communion, World Communion of Reformed Churches, World Baptist Alliance, World Methodist Council and the World Lutheran Federation. Regardless, 900 million is the most accepted figure among various authors and scholars, and thus is used in this article. Note that this 900 million figure also includes Anglicanism, as well as Anabaptists, Baptists and multiple other groups that might sometimes disavow a common \\"Protestant\\" designation, and would rather prefer to be called, simply, \\"Christian\\".

Instead, they are broadly linked to Pentecostalism or similar other independent evangelical and revivalistic movements that originated in the beginning of the 20th century. For this reason, several sources tend to differentiate them from Protestants and classify them as together as Independents, Non-core Protestants etc. Also included in this category are the numerous, yet very similar Nondenominational churches. Nonetheless, sources eventually combine their numbers to the Protestant tally. Despite the absence of centralized control or leadership, if considered as a single cohort, this will easily be the second largest Christian tradition after Roman Catholicism.

Most of these denominations came into being when existing Protestant Churches adopted reformational variants of Orthodox Christian liturgy and worship; while others are the result of reformations of Orthodox Christian beliefs and practices, inspired by the teachings of Western Protestant missionaries. Some Protestant Eastern Churches are in communion with similar Western Protestant Churches. However, Protestant Eastern Christianity within itself, does not constitute a single communion. This is due to the diverse polities, practices, liturgies and orientations of the denominations which fall under this category. *Mar Thoma Syrian Church – 1.1 million =Church of the East – 0.6 million= Divisions occurred within the church itself, but by 1830 two unified patriarchates and distinct churches remained: the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church (an Eastern Catholic Church in communion with the Holy See).

The grounds of Tolethorpe occupy about seven acres. History For 800 years from around 1088 until 1839 it was the home of three distinguished families, the de Tolethorpes (1088–1316), the Burtons (1316–1503) and the Brownes (1503–1839). Sir Thomas Burton (c.1369–1438) was MP for Rutland three times and High Sheriff of Rutland three times. Francis Browne was MP for Stamford and High Sheriff for 1524. His grandson Robert Browne (c. 1550-1633), born at Tolethorpe, became the leader of the Brownists, early advocates of a congregational form of organisation for the Church of England. Having in 1580 attempted to set up a separate church in Norwich, he moved to Middelburg in the Netherlands in 1581.Stamford Shakespeare Company He returned to England and to the Church of England, being employed as a schoolmaster and parish priest. The estate was purchased in 1864 by Charles Ormston Eaton, of a Stamford banking family, who carried out a major reconstruction of the hall and formal gardens. He added a large wing on the east in the Jacobean style, and another smaller one on the west. The date 1867 appears on brackets of the rainwater heads. From the 1920s onwards, Tolethorpe Hall was rented by John Burnaby-Atkins, head of a landed gentry family of Halstead Place, Kent; his widow lived there until 1967,Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th edition, vol. 1, Peter Townend, Burke's Peerage Ltd, 1965, p. 26Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes, Kelly's Directories, 1969, p. 374https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lieutenant-colonel-f-j-burnaby-atkins- kx9zsr8vkzn when the Eatons sold it to a Cambridgeshire farmer who sold it to Michael Racher in 1972 who, in 1977, sold the near derelict hall and a few acres of land to the Stamford Shakespeare Company. The hall and its gardens are now noted as an outdoor Shakespearian theatre. The hall itself stands on the middle of three terraces cut in sloping ground. Its raked auditorium is arranged on the lower one, looking outward across the lower terrace which forms the open air stage behind which, is the open country of the Gwash Valley.

Ludwig Kaas (23 May 1881 - 15 April 1952) was a German Roman Catholic priest and politician of the Centre Party during the Weimar Republic. He was instrumental in brokering the Reichskonkordat between the Holy See and the German Reich. Early career Born in Trier, Kaas was ordained a priest in 1906 and studied history and Canon law in Trier and Rome. In 1906 he completed a doctorate in theology and in 1909 he obtained a second doctorate in philosophy. In 1910 he was appointed rector of an orphanage and boarding school near Koblenz. Until 1933, he devoted his spare time to scholarly pursuits. In 1916 he published the book \\"Ecclesiastical jurisdiction in the Catholic Church in Prussia\\" (Die geistliche Gerichtsbarkeit der katholischen Kirche in Preußen in Vergangenheit und Gegenwart mit besonderer Berücksichtigung des Wesens der Monarchie), demonstrating his expertise in church history, Canon law and his political interests. In 1918 he requested to be sent to a parish, but Michael Felix Korum of Trier refused and instead appointed him professor of canon law at the Trier seminary in 1918. In that position, he published the study \\"Missing in war and remarriage in state law and canon law\\" (Kriegsverschollenheit und Wiederverheiratung nach staatlichen und kirchlichen Recht), dealing with remarriage in case of spouses missing in war. In 1919 he was offered the chair for canon law at the university of Bonn and was initially inclined to accept it, but as he did not find the conditions in Bonn to his liking and after consultation with Bishop Korum he refused the offer.Volk, Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.7.1933, p. 38-43. Entry into politics Distressed by the revolution, Kaas also decided to engage in politics and joined the Centre Party. In 1919 he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly and in 1920 to the Reichstag, of which he was a member until 1933. He was also elected to the Prussian state council, the representation of Prussia's provinces. As a parliamentarian Kaas specialized in foreign policy. From 1926 to 1930 he was a German delegate to the League of Nations.Biographie: Ludwig Kaas, 1881-1952 Lebendiges Museum Online Kaas considered himself a \\"Rhenian Patriot\\" and advocated the creation of a Rhineland state within the framework of the German Reich. In 1923, a year of crisis, he – just like Konrad Adenauer, then mayor of Cologne – fought the separatists that wanted to break away the Rhineland from Germany. Despite French occupation, he sought reconciliation with France and voiced this desire in a famous Reichstag speech on 5 December 1923. Despite personal reservations towards the Social Democrats (SPD), he developed a cordial relationship with President Friedrich Ebert and willingly acknowledged the SPD's accomplishments after 1918. Kaas supported foreign minister Stresemann's policy of reconciliation and denounced nationalist agitation against this policy - agitation he considered to be irresponsible. Advisor to the Nuncio Pacelli In 1920, Eugenio Pacelli, the Papal Nuncio to Bavaria, was also appointed Nuncio to Germany. In view of this new position, he asked Cardinal Adolf Bertram of Breslau, to provide him with experts who might serve as a link between the Nuncio in Munich and the Prussian bishops. Bertram suggested Kaas, who in his academic work had developed a special interest in the relations between the state and the Catholic Church.Scholder, Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich, p. 81. The workload as a professor, a parliamentarian and as advisor to the Nuncio strained Kaas's energies. Though Kaas tried to convince himself that his primary obligation was to his own diocese, it was his academic post that always came out last. In 1922 he was prepared to resign his chair, but Bertram and Pacelli insisted that he should stay until he had obtained a secure position within the diocese that would not hinder his external commitments. Bertram, following Pacelli's wishes, proposed to the new bishop of Trier, Franz Rudolf Bornewasser, to make Kaas a cathedral canon, but the bishop refused. An angry Kaas announced he would give up all his other commitments and concentrate on his academic work, but eventually he was reconciled to Bornewasser. On 1 April 1924, Kaas was appointed to the Cathedral chapter. Bishop Bornewasser had allowed Kaas to keep his parliamentary seat until September 1924, but expected him to resign it afterwards and concentrate on his administrative and academic work within the diocese. However, as Pacelli asked the bishop not to insist on this as it would \\"substantially hinder the hitherto influential work of Dr. Kaas and damage an effective representation of ecclesiastical interests in a deplorable way\\". Bornewasser, though legally in a stronger position, yielded to these considerations of expediency and did not press his demand again. In the same year, Kaas resigned from his academic chair. Pascalina Lehnert, writing after Pacelli had already become Pope Pius XII, described the relationship between Kaas and Pacelli in the following words: In 1925, as Pacelli was also appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Prussia and moved his office to Berlin, the cooperation between Pacelli and Kaas became even closer. Out of this involvement grew a formal but close and lasting friendship, which remained one of the basic factors throughout Kaas's life. In this position Kaas contributed to the successful conclusion of the Prussian Concordat negotiations with Prussia in 1929. After this achievement, Pacelli was called back to the Vatican to be appointed Cardinal Secretary of State. Pacelli asked Kaas, who had accompanied him on his travel, to stay in Rome but Kaas declined because of his ecclesiastical and political duties in Germany. Nonetheless, Kaas would frequently travel to Rome, where he would stay with Pacelli, and experience first hand the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty, which he penned an article on. In 1931 and 1932 continued as an advisor in negotiations for a Reichskonkordat; that, however, came to nothing.Volk, Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.7.1933, p. 44-59. In 1929, Kaas published a volume of Nuncio Pacelli's speeches. In the introduction, he described him as: “Angelus not nuntius, ... his impressive personality, his sacerdotal words, the popularity he generated in public meetings\\"Kaas, Eugenio Pacelli, Erster Apostolischer Nuntius beim Deutschen Reich, Gesammelte Reden, p. 24. Kaas as party chairman Without being a candidate, September 1928 Kaas was elected chairman of the Centre Party, in order to mediate the tension between the party's wings and to strengthen their ties with the Bishops.Klaus Scholder, Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich, Ullstein, 1986, p.185 Under Kaas' watch, the Centre began drifting steadily rightward. Much of his time was occupied in arranging a Reich-wide Concordat. This work made him increasingly distrustful of democracy, and he eventually concluded that only authoritarian rule could protect the interests of the church. From 1930 onwards, Kaas loyally supported the administration under the Centre's Heinrich Brüning, who served as the leader of the party's Reichstag faction due to Kaas' frequent travel to the Vatican. In 1932 he campaigned for the re-election of President Paul von Hindenburg, calling him a \\"venerated historical personality\\" and \\"the keeper of the constitution\\". As his frequent Vatican travels hampered his work as chairman, Kaas was prepared to yield the leadership of the party to Brüning, whom Hindenburg had dismissed in May, but the former Chancellor declined and asked the prelate to stay. In 1932 Kaas and Brüning led the Centre Party into opposition to the new Chancellor: party renegade Franz von Papen. Kaas called him the \\"Ephialtes of the Centre Party\\".Klaus Scholder, Die Kirchen und das Dritte Reich, Ullstein, 1986, p.175 Kaas tried to re-establish a working parliament by cooperation with the National Socialists. = Hitler's Enabling Act = When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor on 30 January 1933 based on a coalition between National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP), German National People's Party (DNVP) and independent conservatives which excluded the Centre Party, Kaas felt betrayed. In the campaign leading up to the election on 5 March, Kaas vigorously campaigned against the new government, but after the government parties succeeded in attaining a majority, he visited Vice Chancellor Papen, offering to put an end to their old animosities. Later that month, from 15 March, he was the main advocate supporting the Hitler administration's Enabling Act in return for certain constitutional and, allegedlyHeinrich Brüning, Memoirs 1918 - 1934 ecclesiastic guarantees. Hitler responded positively via Papen. On 21 and 22 March the Centre leadership negotiated with Hitler on the conditions and reached an agreement. A letter, in which Hitler would confirm the agreement in writing, was promised by the government but never delivered. Kaas - as much as the other party leaders - was aware of the doubtful nature of any guarantees, and, when the Centre fraction assembled on 23 March to decide on their vote, he still advised his fellow party members to support the bill, given the \\"precarious state of the fraction\\", saying: \\"On the one hand we must preserve our soul, but on the other hand a rejection of the Enabling Act would result in unpleasant consequences for fraction and party. What is left is only to guard us against the worst. Were a two-thirds majority not obtained, the government's plans would be carried through by other means. The President has acquiesced in the Enabling Act. From the DNVP no attempt of relieving the situation is to be expected.\\" A considerable group of parliamentarians however opposed the chairman's course, among whom were the former Chancellors, his nemesis Heinrich Brüning and Joseph Wirth and former minister Adam Stegerwald. The opponents also argued in regard to Catholic social teaching that ruled out participating in an act of revolution. The proponents however argued that a \\"national revolution\\" had already occurred with Hitler's appointment and the presidential decree suspending basic rights, and that the Enabling Act would contain revolutionary force and move the government back to a legal order. Both groupings were not unaffected by Hitler's self-portrayal as a moderate seeking co-operation, as given on the Day of Potsdam of 21 March, as against the more revolutionary SA led by Ernst Röhm. In the end the majority of Centre parliamentarians supported Kaas's proposal. Brüning and his followers agreed to respect party discipline by also voting in favour of the bill. On 23 March, the Reichstag assembled at midday under turbulent circumstances. Some SA men served as guards, while others crowded outside the building, both to intimidate any opposing views. Hitler's speech, which emphasised the importance of Christianity to the German culture, was aimed particularly at assuaging the Centre Party's sensibilities and almost verbatim incorporated Kaas's requested guarantees. Kaas gave a speech, voicing the Centre's support for the bill amid \\"concerns put aside\\", while Brüning notably remained silent. When parliament assembled again in the evening, all parties except the SPD, represented by their chairman Otto Wels, voted in favour of the Enabling Act. This vote was a major step in the institution of the dictatorship of Adolf Hitler and is remembered as the prime example of a democracy voting for its own demise. Because of Kaas's request for guarantees and because of his later involvement in the Reichskonkordat negotiations, it is sometimes alleged that Kaas's assent was part of a quid pro quo of interests between the Holy See and the new regime. There is however no evidence for involvement of the Holy See in these dealings . Kaas had planned to travel to Rome since the beginning of the year, to discuss a conflict in Eupen and Malmedy, formerly German towns now belonging to Belgium, where priests had been arrested. This trip had been postponed by the political events - first Hitler's appointment, then the March elections, then by the Enabling Act -, but on 24 March, one day after the decision, Kaas finally managed to leave for Rome. During this stay, Kaas explained to Pacelli the Centre's rationale for acceding to the Enabling Act. On 30 March, he was called back to Germany to take part in sessions of the working committee, that had been promised during the Enabling Act negotiations. This committee was chaired by Hitler and Kaas and was supposed to inform about further legislative measures, but it only met three times: on 31 March, on 2 April (followed by a private talk between Kaas and Hitler) and on 7 April. On 5 April Kaas also reported to the foreign office about his talk in the Eupen-Malmedy affair. Reichskonkordat On 7 April, directly after the third meeting of the working committee, Kaas once more left Berlin and headed for Rome. The next day, after having changed trains in Munich, the Prelate happened to meet Vice-Chancellor Papen in the dining car. Papen officially went on skiing holidays to Italy, but his real destination was Vatican City, where he was to offer a Reichskonkordat on his government's behalf. Kaas and Papen traveled on together and had some discussions about the matter on the train. After their arrival in Rome, Kaas was received first by Pacelli on 9 April. One day later, Papen had a morning meeting with Pacelli and presented Hitler's offer. Cardinal Pacelli subsequently authorized Kaas, who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations, to negotiate the draft of the terms with Papen. These discussions also prolonged his stay in Rome and raised questions in Germany as to a conflict of interest, since as a German parliamentarian he was advising the Vatican. On 5 May Kaas resigned from his post as party chairman, and pressure from the German government forced him to withdraw from visibly participating in the concordat negotiations. Though allegedly the Vatican tried to hold back the exclusion of Catholic clergy and organisations from politics, Pacelli was known to strongly favour the withdrawal of all priests from active politics, which is Church position in all countries even today. In the end, the Vatican accepted the restriction to the religious and charitable field. Even before the Roman negotiations had been concluded, the Centre Party yielded to increasing government pressure and dissolved itself, thus excluding German Catholics from participating in political life. According to Oscar Halecki, Kaas and Pacelli, \\"on account of the exclusion of Catholics as a political party from the public life of Germany, found it all the more necessary that the Holy See assure government guarantees to maintain their position in the life of the nation\\" Oscar Halecki, Pius XII, New York, 1951, p.73. He maintains that Hitler had from the beginning no other aim than a war of extermination of the Church.Oscar Halecki, Pius XII,New York, 1951, p.74 Pacelli, now Pope Pius XII, met the German Cardinals on 6 March 1939, three days after his election. He referred to the constant Nazi attacks against the Church, and the Nazi responses to his protests, saying, \\"They always responded, 'sorry, but we cannot act because the concordat is not legally binding yet'. But after its ratification, things did not get any better, they got worse. The experiences of the past years are not encouraging.\\"Proces Verbal de la 1. conference, Lettres de Pie XII aux Eveques Allemands, p. 416. Despite this, the Holy See continued diplomatic relations with Germany in order to \\"connect to the bishops and faithful in Germany\\".Proces Verbal de la 2. conference, Lettres de Pie XII aux Eveques Allemands, p. 424-425. As a result of the Concordat, the Church gained more teachers, more school buildings and more places for Catholic pupils. At the same time it was well known to Pacelli and Pope Pius XI that the Jews were being treated very differently. The Centre Party's vote for the Enabling Act, at Kaas's urging, was an action which fostered the establishment of the Hitlerian tyranny.Review by John Cornwell of Hitler's Priests: Catholic Clergy and National Socialism, Kevin P. Spicer (2008) in Church History (2009), pp 235-37. At the Vatican Kaas, who had played a pivotal role in the concordat negotiations, hoped to head an information office, watching over the implementation in Germany. However, Cardinal Bertram considered Kaas to be the wrong man, given his political past. Also, Kaas's conduct was controversial among his fellow party members, who saw his sudden and lasting move to Rome as an act of defection and his involvement in the concordat negotiations as treason to the party. A prime example of this view is Heinrich Brüning, who denounced Kaas in his own memoirs written in exile and not undisputed among historians.Volk, Das Reichskonkordat vom 20.7.1933, p. 201-212. Cardinal Bertram had proposed to elevate Kaas to honours without responsibilities. Accordingly, Kaas was appointed papal protonotary on 20 March 1934 and canon of the Basilica of Saint Peter on 6 April 1935. Meanwhile, the dioceses of Trier stripped Kaas of his position in the cathedral chapter of Trier. The exiled Kaas suffered from homesickness and from the rejection by his fellow party members and the German episcopate. On 20 August 1936, Kaas was appointed Economicus and Secretary of the Holy Congregation of the fabric of St. Peter's Basilica. Pacelli was elected Pope Pius XII on 2 March 1939. Late in that year, after the outbreak of World War II, Kaas was one of the key figures for the secret Vatican Exchanges, in which Widerstand circles within the German army tried to negotiate with the Allies through the mediation of the Pope Pius XII. Josef Müller, a Bavarian lawyer, would travel to Rome from Berlin with instructions from Hans Oster or Hans von Dohnanyi and confer with Kaas or the Pope's secretary Pater Robert Leiber, in order to avoid direct contact between Müller and the Pope. These exchanges resumed in 1943 after the Casablanca conference, but neither attempt was successful. After his election, Pius XII had decided to accelerate the archaeological excavations under St. Peter's Basilica and put Kaas in charge. At the Christmas message of the Holy Year 1950, Pius XII presented the preliminary results, which deemed it likely that the tomb of Saint Peter was resting below the Papal altar of the Basilica. Not all questions were solved, and Kaas continued excavations after 1950, despite an emerging illness.Tardini, Pio XII, p. 76. Ludwig Kaas died in Rome in 1952, aged 70. He was first buried in the cemetery of Campo Santo in the Vatican. Later, Pope Pius XII ordered the body of his friend to be put to rest in the crypt of St. Peter's Basilica. Ludwig Kaas is thus the only Monsignor who rests in the vicinity of virtually all Popes of the twentieth century. To succeed him in his work, Pope Pius XII appointed a woman, Professor Margherita Guarducci, another Vatican novelty.Lehnert, Ich durfte ihm dienen, p. 59. List of publications Ludwig Kaas was a scholar and prolific writer, addressing a wide range of issues in Latin or German concerning marital law, education reform, moral and systematic theology, canon law, prisoners of war, the speeches of Eugenio Pacelli, historical issues, policy issues of the Weimar Republic and the Reichskonkordat. Some of his writings were published after his death. References Sources *Halecki, Oscar. Pius XII, New York (1951). *Kaas, Ludwig.

Social Security Administration. was an American politician from Annapolis, Maryland. A native of Baltimore, Callahan had been a mayor of Annapolis and a director of the Recreation and Parks Department of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. He ran unsuccessfully in the Democratic primary for Anne Arundel County Executive in 2006. The general election winner, Republican John R. Leopold, appointed Callahan chief administrative officer of Anne Arundel County, a position he held at the time of his death. Career in Parks and Recreation Department As director of the Recreation and Parks Department, he was at the center of two controversial park developments. One of the park developments involved the Smith Farm on the Broadneck Peninsula. The plan called for tearing down most of a horse farm and building ball fields over the land, leaving limited space for a community equestrian center. Local citizens organized against this proposal, and groups such as WHOA (We Hold Officials Accountable), SACReD (South Arundel Citizens for Responsible Development), and the Anne Arundel Green Party literally stood in front of the bulldozers to stop the farm from being torn down. Eventually the farm was preserved and is now the Andy Smith Equestrian Center. The other controversy entailed converting a substantial portion of wetlands on Franklin Point into ball fields and parking lots. The local community organized against the proposal, offering alternate sites for the ball fields. However, it was only after the Critical Area Commission ruled that plans for the park would have to be severely curtailed that Anne Arundel County backed out of the proposed development. Callahan stated that the new offer would \\"fundamentally change the character of the plan, substantially reduce the number of park activities available to the Shady Side community and the public, and make development of certain park features problematical or perhaps impossible.\\" This ended 5 years of negotiations between county and state officials. During Callahan's tenure as the Recreation and Parks Director, football commissioners throughout the County petitioned the County Executive to have him removed from his position. On September 15, 2002 a fight broke out in the parking lot between the two competing football teams, the Cape St. Claire Cougars and Riviera Beach Buccaneers. During the incident, assistant coach Mike T. Pivec, 52, allegedly hit Rory Fracasse Jr., 15, in the face. The head coaches of both teams were put on two game suspensions. Cape St. Claire's Michael Harris, appealed the decision to county recreation officials under Callahans supervision. The officials lifted the two game suspension, however \\"members of the football association said that Callahan, who is a friend of Harris, intervened in the appeals process.\\" They later petitioned to have him removed from the position, but were unsuccessful. Political career Callahan was a mayor of Annapolis, serving from 1985 to 1989. He was originally a Republican before serving as mayor. He was defeated in the 1989 mayoral primary. He ran again for mayor in 1993 as an Independent, placing second in the General Election. Callahan was again the Democratic nominee for mayor in 1997. He was also an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for Anne Arundel County Executive in 1990 and 2006. Tenure as CEO Callahan served as CEO of the P.O.I.N.T. Corp., which owned Chiro-Serve. After two years under his leadership, the P.O.I.N.T. Corp. and Chiro-Serve went under in 1996. Death Callahan suffered a heart attack at his home on February 8, 2012, and died later that morning at Anne Arundel Medical Center. He was 70 years old.

Wang of the C.O.A.A ; at the end Charles Hunter, general manager of CAMCO to the right of C.F. Wang. (Photo from the collection of Eugenie Buchan, with permission, identifications by Eugenie Buchan ) The Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company (CAMCO; ), also known as the Loiwing Factory (雷允飛機製造廠) after they moved to Yunnan, was a Chinese aircraft manufacturer established by American entrepreneur William D. Pawley in the 1930s. History Starting in 1933, CAMCO assembled (probably from factory-supplied kits) about 100 Hawk II and Hawk III fighter-bombers in a factory at Hangzhou Jianqiao Airport. The planes had originally been designed as scout bombers for the U.S. Navy. They served as the backbone of the Chinese Air Force during the first year of the Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945). As Nationalist Chinese forces were driven back from the coast in the winter of 1937-38, CAMCO retreated with them. Pawley's factory was reconstituted in Hankou, where it repaired airplanes damaged in combat or by bombing, and may also have assembled some later-model Curtiss H-75 fighters, an export version of the U.S. Army's P-36 monoplane fighter. When Hankou fell in October 1938, CAMCO moved to Hengyang and added Vultee V-11 light bombers to its product line. At the same time, work was started at a new factory far in the hinterland, at Loiwing on the China-Burma frontier. Opened in the spring of 1939, it was supplied by the mountainous \\"Burma Road\\" from Rangoon (now Yangon). The factory was financed by the nationalist government in Chongqing. An undetermined number of Hawk 75 (P-36 type) and Curtiss-Wright CW-21 fighters were assembled there. In the winter of 1940-1941, Pawley became involved in the recruitment and supplying of the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG), later known as the Flying Tigers. AVG pilots were released from U.S. military service to serve as \\"instructors\\" or \\"Metal Workers\\" for the Chinese; their employer of record was CAMCO, which also set up a facility at Mingaladon airport outside Rangoon to assemble the 100 Curtiss P-40 fighters sold to China to equip the AVG. From offices in Rangoon and New York City, CAMCO also provided housekeeping and record-keeping services for the AVG until its disbandment in July 1942. The CAMCO factory at Loiwing was used to repair AVG P-40s, and its airfield was briefly used by the AVG to mount raids into Thailand and Burma. Following the Allied retreat from Burma in the spring of 1942, the CAMCO plant was lost to the Japanese, and Pawley moved his operation to Bangalore, India, where he evidently joined forces with an Indian firm, Hindustan Aircraft Ltd. Here he assembled Harlow trainers for the Indian Air Force and arguably launched Bangalore on its 20th century path as the high- tech centre on the subcontinent.

Methods of meat processing include salting, curing, fermentation, and smoking. Processed meat is usually composed of pork or beef, but also poultry, while it can also contain offal or meat by- products such as blood. Processed meat products include bacon, ham, sausages, salami, corned beef, jerky, hot dog, lunch meat, canned meat and meat-based sauces. Meat processing includes all the processes that change fresh meat with the exception of simple mechanical processes such as cutting, grinding or mixing.Introduction Meat processing began as soon as people realized that cooking and salting prolongs the life of fresh meat. It is not known when this took place; however, the process of salting and sun-drying was recorded in Ancient Egypt, while using ice and snow is credited to early Romans, and canning was developed by Nicolas Appert who in 1810 received a prize for his invention from the French government.  Relationship to cancer  The International Agency for Research on Cancer at the World Health Organization classifies processed meat as Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans), because the IARC has found sufficient evidence that consumption of processed meat by humans causes colorectal cancer. A 2016 report by the American Institute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Research Fund found that processed meat consumption increased the risk of stomach cancer. A 2012 paper by Bryan et. al. identified Helicobacter pylori as a potential causative agent that warranted further study.  Preservatives  The preservative sodium nitrite (E250) (mixed into curing-salt) is well known for its role in inhibiting the growth of clostridium botulinum bacteria spores in processed and refrigerated meats. A principal concern about sodium nitrite is the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines in meats containing sodium nitrite when meat is charred or overcooked. Such carcinogenic nitrosamines can also be formed from the reaction of nitrite with secondary amines under acidic conditions (such as occurs in the human stomach) as well as during the curing process used to preserve meats. Nitrate and nitrite are consumed from plant foods as well as animal foods, with 80% of a typical person's nitrate consumption coming from vegetables, especially leafy and root vegetables such as spinach and beets. Some nitrate is converted to nitrite in the human body. Nitrite is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and is not directly carcinogenic. Yet, when nitrate or nitrite interact with certain components in red meat, such as heme iron, amines, and amides, they can form nitroso compounds, which may contribute to the association between consumption of processed meats and higher incidence of colorectal cancer.

They gradually evolved, or reemerged, from the long running sociopolitical milieu of the Border. Mention of them appears suddenly in historical records and gives the false impression that they appeared suddenly, but the first statute passed to deal with them, the Moss Troopers Act 1662 (13 & 14 Cha. 2. c. 22), notes the moss-troopers to have been a long- running problem.\\"An Act for preventing of Theft and Rapine upon the Northern Borders of England.\\" With the 1662 act about to expire, the Cavalier Parliament passed the Moss Troopers Act 1666 (18 Cha. 2 c. 3).

Moss-troopers usually operated in small bands, either on the fringes of the Highlands or in the border regions. Many Highland lairds complained of moss- troopers' cattle-stealing and of how they incurred military reprisals against the Highlands as a whole.

He played college football at the University of Maryland. As a professional, Wycheck played 11 seasons for the Washington Redskins and the Tennessee Titans, where he threw the lateral pass in the Music City Miracle. He has also spent time as a professional wrestler. Wycheck was the color commentator on the Tennessee Titans Radio Network from 2005 to 2016, and from 2004 to 2017, Wycheck co-hosted a morning sports radio show on Nashville radio station WGFX. Early life and college Born in Philadelphia, Wycheck attended Archbishop Ryan High School in Northeast Philadelphia and the University of Maryland, College Park. As a freshman, Wycheck led the Atlantic Coast Conference in receptions with 58 for 509 yards, including a school record 14 catches in a game against Virginia Tech. As a sophomore, Wycheck led the team with 45 receptions, made 2nd team All-ACC, and set the conference record for most receptions ever by a player in their first two seasons. In Wycheck's third season, Maryland hired coach Mark Duffner, who switched the team to a run and shoot offense, which tended to use four receivers and no tight end. As a result, Wycheck's playing time and receptions declined significantly. However, injuries eventually forced Duffner to play Wycheck at running back, where he started the final three games of the season, rushing for more than 100 yards twice, including a 162-yard performance in Maryland's 53-23 win over the Clemson Tigers in the season finale. \\"I feel like I really never got into the flow of the offense,\\" Wycheck said after the season. \\"The last three games were great, but I'm a tight end type more than a running back.\\"https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs- xpm-1992-11-18-1992323212-story.html He decided to forgo his senior year and enter the NFL draft, finishing his three seasons at Maryland with 134 receptions for 1,183 yards, 80 carries for 391 yards, and eight touchdowns.https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/frank-wycheck-1.html Professional career =Washington Redskins= Wycheck was drafted in sixth round (160th overall) of the 1993 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. With the arrival of new coach Norv Turner in 1994, the Redskins made a failed attempt to switch Wycheck to fullback. Later that same season, Wycheck was suspended by the league for testing positive for anabolic steroids. Wycheck was released by the Redskins in 1995. =Tennessee Oilers/Titans= In 1995, Wycheck was signed by the Houston Oilers, who later became the Tennessee Titans. The Oilers had a rocky transition to Tennessee, but Wycheck quickly adopted Nashville as his hometown (even before the team officially left Houston), and became one of the most visible players in the community. When the team reached enormous popularity in Nashville, Wycheck's stellar performance on the field and visibility in the media helped him become one of the most popular players on the team. Even following his retirement, he remains a popular public figure in Middle Tennessee. Wycheck also made the Pro Bowl in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Wycheck is perhaps most famous for his participation in the Music City Miracle, at the end of the 2000 wild card game against the Buffalo Bills. The Titans were down 16–15 with 16 seconds remaining. Wycheck took a hand-off from Lorenzo Neal and then threw the ball across the field to Kevin Dyson, who then turned the ball upfield 75 yards for the game-winning touchdown. The Titans would go on to make the Super Bowl that year, but would lose by a touchdown. Wycheck continued to play for the Titans before retiring after the 2003 season. Wycheck amassed 505 receptions for 5,126 yards and 28 touchdowns over his 11-year career, one of only eight tight ends to surpass 500 receptions in NFL history (the others being Jason Witten, Shannon Sharpe, Ozzie Newsome, Kellen Winslow, Tony Gonzalez, Antonio Gates, and Travis Kelce). Wycheck led the Titans in receiving for three consecutive seasons (1999–2001). In the 1999 and 2002 postseasons, he had 14 receptions, twice tying the franchise record held by Tim Wilson and Jackie Harris. Wycheck also went 5-for-6 passing the ball in his career (all on trick plays), resulting in 148 yards, two touchdowns, and a perfect 158.3 passer rating. Professional wrestling appearances On May 31, 2007 Total Nonstop Action Wrestling announced that during a press conference in Nashville, that an altercation between Wycheck and James Storm disrupted events. Wycheck, with the help of Jeff Jarrett, delivered a guitar shot to James Storm after the \\"Tennessee Cowboy\\" spat beer in the former Tennessee Titan's face. TNA Wrestling would then announce that Wycheck has agreed in principle to a match with James Storm at Slammiversary on June 17, 2007. The match was made official on TNA's website later that day. At Slammiversary, he teamed with Jerry Lynn to defeat Storm and Ron Killings in a tag match. Wycheck won the match with a Cradle Piledriver, Lynn's finishing move. Broadcasting career In 2001, Wycheck \\"hosted\\" his own Titan player show with George Plaster and Willy Daunic on WGFX 104.5 FM until his retirement from the game. Wycheck became a co-host of the morning drive time show The Wake Up Zone with Kevin Ingram and Mark Howard on the Nashville radio station WGFX \\"104.5 The Zone\\". Beginning with the 2005 season, Wycheck assumed color commentary duties on the Tennessee Titans Radio Network. Prior to the 2017 Titans preseason, it was announced that Wycheck would step down from being color commentator due to lingering head issues sustained in his football career. His absence was supposed to be temporary, but replacement Dave McGinnis returned for the 2018 season. In a corresponding move, Wycheck also left The Wake Up Zone morning show in 2017. Personal life In 1995, Wycheck married Cherryn Krol. They have two children: Deanna (born 1991) and Madison (born 1997). Wycheck is a strong supporter of the Tennessee Special Olympics, hosting the Wycheck Harley Ride charity event.

Seen as the successor technology to spreadsheet software in reviews of the time, and rival to the then-dominant Lotus 1-2-3, Javelin won numerous industry awards, including besting Microsoft's new Excel for the InfoWorld Software Product of the Year award. Javelin Software fell on difficult times when their initial public offering had to be cancelled due to it being scheduled for only a few days after the stock market crash of 1987. The company's assets were later purchased by Information Resources, Incorporated (IRI), which sold enhancements to Javelin until 1994 when IRI was itself purchased by Oracle Corporation, who promptly discontinued the product. Screenshot: A variable with monthly period Unlike models in a spreadsheet, Javelin models are built on objects called variables, not on data in cells of a report. For example, a time series, or any variable, is an object in itself, not a collection of cells which happen to appear in a row or column. Variables have many attributes, including complete awareness of their connections to all other variables, data references, and text and image notes. Calculations are performed on these objects, as opposed to a range of cells, so adding two time series automatically aligns them in calendar time, or in a user-defined time frame. Data are independent of worksheets--variables, and therefore data, cannot be destroyed by deleting a row, column or entire worksheet. For instance, January's costs are subtracted from January's revenues, regardless of where or whether either appears in a worksheet. This permits actions later used in pivot tables, except that flexible manipulation of report tables is but one of many capabilities supported by variables. Moreover, if costs are entered by week and revenues by month, Javelin can allocate or interpolate as appropriate. This object design enabled variables and whole models to reference each other with user-defined variable names, and to perform multidimensional analysis and massive, but easily editable consolidations. Javelin encourages viewing data and algorithms in various self-documenting ways, including simultaneous multiple synchronized views. For example, users can move through the connections between variables on a diagram while seeing the logical roots and branches of each variable. This is an example of what is perhaps its primary contribution—the concept of traceability of a user's logic or model structure through its twelve views. Among its dynamically linked views were: diagram, formulas, table, chart, QuickGraph, worksheet, notes, errors, macro, graph. A complex model can be dissected and understood by others who had no role in its creation, and this remains unique even today. The second fundamental advance in Javelin's design is extensive built-in time series modeling, including calendar intelligence. Javelin was used primarily for corporate and governmental financial modeling, but was also used to build instructional models in college chemistry courses, to model the world's economies, and by the military early in the Star Wars project. It is still in use by institutions for which model integrity is mission critical. Javelin received multiple awards, including: \\"Best of 1985\\" for technical excellence from PC Magazine; \\"Most Significant Product\\" from PC Week; and \\"Software Product of the Year\\". 'The Infoworld award apparently created some consternation in the top ranks of number two Microsoft:' Javelin was conceived by co-founder Rob Firmin, Chairman and CEO, whose University of Chicago doctorate research and subsequent financial planning work at Prime Computer led him to creation of the concepts. Co-founder Stan Kugell, President, worked with Firmin on the user interface. The Javelin development team was led by Christopher Herot, Vice President of Engineering, and included Charles Frankston, brother of spreadsheet co-inventor Bob Frankston, Arye Gittelman, John R. Levine, Louise Cousins (Pathe), and Peter Pathe. Some parts of Javelin's approach were later used by other products such as Lotus's Improv. Lotus essentially copied two of Javelin's features (named data arrays and pivot tables) onto a NeXTSTEP-based and later Windows-based GUI to create Improv. Since Improv was not based on 1980s MS-DOS technology, it suffered less memory-based limitations than Javelin, however, Javelin performed well with DOS extended and expanded memory. While its business failure has been attributed to the infancy of business GUI software at the time, as well as an ill-conceived marketing plan that placed it head to head with the popular spreadsheet 1-2-3, enterprise-wide financial models converted into Javelin models at times strained the PC resources of the day. Despite this, it remained a standard for financial modeling and econometrics for several years after it was discontinued by Oracle. For example, the World Bank modeled the world's economies in Javelin and distributed them in Javelin format for a number of years.

It rises just outside the village of Knossington in Leicestershire, near the western edge of Rutland. It is about long.Wheeler and Batty (1896), p.291 Course The source of the river is just north-west of the village of Knossington, but the Gwash is formed of several small headwaters that come together near Braunston- in-Rutland before passing the site of Brooke Priory at and running westward to pass under the railway Northwest of Manton (). The Gwash then helps to fill the Rutland Water reservoir which was formed by damming its valley at Empingham. From the reservoir a controlled flow is released to maintain the flow around Tolethorpe Hall and Stamford and into the River Welland. The flow is enhanced by the Gwash's tributary, the North Brook, at in Empingham, which significantly helps maintain riverlife. East of Stamford, its course is now fixed but it lies in a small flood plain which shows clear signs of the river's former meandering. The pasture fields include depressions which fill in wet seasons forming oxbow lakes, though they are not of the classical shape. Near Stamford it is the parish boundary between Stamford and Uffington. The Gwash Valley east of Stamford on the Macmillan Way West of Stamford, the Gwash crossed the Stamford Canal, requiring some elaborate hydraulic works. Although the canal has been dry for over a century, the Borderville weir has only just been removed, and some meanders re-watered. The river feeds the millpond at Newstead Mill in the parish of Uffington before entering the Welland at Newstead Bridge just east of Stamford. Wildlife The river supports a wild variety of fish species, including grayling and trout. Chub and dace inhabit the lower length below Newstead bridge in Stamford. There are attempts to re-introduce water voles in the area. There are concerns about non-native signal crayfish becoming dominant in the river, and reports of a deliberate introduction. The river has formed part of pilot control trials. Etymology Newstead Mill, on the Gwash near the confluence with the Welland The name appears to be derived from the Old English (ge)waesc 'a washing, a flood'.The Place-Names of Rutland by Barrie Cox (EPNS, 1994), p2 The earliest form was \\"le Whasse\\" (c1230); the use of an initial G- is first recorded in 1586 and the spelling 'Gwash' appears to be a quasi-Welsh spelling. In literature Local poet John Clare wrote a sonnet about the Gwash, published in Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery (London, 1820): Where winding gash wirls round its wildest scene On this romantic bend I sit me down On that side view the meads their smoothing green Edg'd with the peeping hamlets checkering brown Here the steep hill as dripping headlong down While glides the stream a silver streak between As glides the shaded clouds along the sky Brightning & deep'ning loosing as they're seen In light & shade—so when old willows lean Thus their broad shadow—runs the river bye With tree & bush repleat a wilderd scene & mossd & Ivyd sparkling on my eye— O thus wild musing am I doubly blest My woes unheeding—& my heart at rest.

Life The Pagoda of Fugong Temple, built in 1056 at the site of Daozong's grandmother's family home in Ying County, Shanxi. Emperor Daozong succeeded his father, Emperor Xingzong, in 1055. He was notable for reviving the name \\"Great Liao\\" in 1066, a designation first given the kingdom by Emperor Taizong in 947. Other noteworthy achievements made during his reign include the completion of a Liao edition of the Buddhist Tripitaka and the construction of the Sakyamuni Pagoda in 1056. Emperor Daozong faced a number of assassination attempts throughout his life. In 1063, a group of Khitans, angry that their system of tribal justice had been put under local Han Chinese administration, ambushed the emperor while he was on a hunting trip. Emperor Daozong survived the attack and the rebels were executed. However, in order to reassert his legitimacy as emperor, he was forced to perform a traditional \\"rebirth\\" ceremony. In 1070, he restructured the Liao legal system to reflect the differences in Han Chinese and Khitan customs. Emperor Daozong's wife, Xiao Guanyin, was said to have been a virtuous woman who would persuade him to be a good leader and to purge corrupt officials. However, Daozong was not interested in ruling the empire and did not take her advice seriously. Xiao Guanyin would stay in her chambers and write poetry to pass the time. A corrupt official by the name of Yelü Yixin (耶律乙辛) feared the influence she had on the emperor and plotted to have her removed. Yelü Yixin conspired with a palace maiden into tricking the empress into writing a love poem. When Xiao Guanyin had finished writing the poem, Yelü Yixin presented the poem to Emperor Daozong, and insisted that the poem contained hidden messages that the empress was having an affair with another man. Emperor Daozong believed Yelü Yixin, and executed the empress in 1075. Yelü Yixin then went on to execute the crown prince and any other officials he did not like. Eventually, Emperor Daozong caught on, and began to take away Yelü Yixin's privileges one by one. Yelü Yixin then attempted to defect to Song, but was caught in the process; he was finally executed in 1083 AD, but the damage he had done to the empire was already done. Epitaph for Emperor Daozong Emperor Daozong's reign was fraught with corruption. He spent lavishly on his palaces and his Buddhist worship.

It is the only genus in the family Roridulaceae. It has thin, woody, shyly branching, upright, initially brown, later grey stems, with lance- to awl-shaped leaves crowded at their tips. The star-symmetrical flowers consist from the outside in of five, green or reddish, free sepals, alternating with five white, pink or purple, free petals. Further to the middle and opposite the sepals are five stamens with the anthers initially kinked down. These suddenly flip up if the nectar-containing swelling at its base is being touched. The center of the flower is occupied by a superior ovary. The leaves and sepals carry many sticky tentacles of different sizes, that trap insects. Roridula does not break down the insect proteins, but bugs of the genus Pameridea prey on the trapped insects. These later deposit their feces on the leaves, which take up nutrients from the droppings. The species can be found in the Western Cape province of South Africa. They are commonly known as dewstick or fly bush in English and vlieëbos or vlieëbossie in Afrikaans. Description R. gorgonias can be distinguished by its entire leaves and spiky inflorescencesThe two species in the genus Roridula are slender evergreen shrubs up to 1⅓ m (4 ft) or 2 m (6⅔ ft) high. They grow from a taproot with few side roots. The perennial, upright, shyly branching stems are leafless, except near the top. The leaves are arranged alternately, crowded at the tip of the branches, almost as if in a rosette. The leaves are awl-shaped, lack both stipules and a leaf stalk, either with entire margins or with distanced line-shaped lobes. The leaves and calyx are set with different sizes stalked glands or tentacles that secrete a resin. Two flowers of R. dentata, the one in the background showing three anthers still flipped down, the two in the back already turned up.The 5-merous bisexual flowers are set with several in racemes amidst the crowded leaves at the tip of the branches. The free sepals and petals are well-developed and star-symmetrical. The broadly inverted egg-shaped petals are white, reddish pink or bright purple and are overlapping in a circle in the bud. Inside the petals are five stamens that sit opposite the sepals and below the ovary. The filaments are free, line-shaped, topped by anthers that are connected with the filament near their base. These anthers have two pollen-containing cavities that open inwards through four short slits near the top. The anthers are initially flipped downward on the outside. They are subtended by a swelling that contains a cavity that contains nectar. When the swelling is touched, the anther explosively swings up, releasing the pollen through the slits. The superior ovary in the center of the flower consists of three merged carpels, that together protect three cavities within which are one to four anatropous ovules each of which is covered by a single layer. The upright style tapers towards the top and carries a small globe-shaped stigma or expands towards the top into an inverted cone-shaped stigma, covered in small grains. The smooth, cartilaginous, dehiscent fruit opens with three valves. The small, dark reddish brown seeds are ellipsoid in shape either with a smoothed netted structure or angular with three sutures and with prominent warts or a honeycomb-like structure. Both species are diploids having six sets of homologue chromosomes (2n=12). =Differences between the species= R. dentata can be distinguished by its larger habit of up to 2 m, the line-shaped lobes along its leaves and the umbel-like inflorescences, whereas R. gorgonias is smaller, up to 1⅓ m, has entire leaves and spike-like inflorescences. Taxonomy Carl Linnaeus described Roridula in 1764. The name Roridula derives from roridus, a Latin word meaning “dewy”, which refers to the fine drops of liquid on the tentacles that give the leaves a dewy appearance. Over time, different botanists have held different views on the affinities of the genus Roridula. Jules Émile Planchon thought it should be assigned to the Ochnaceae in 1848. George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker, two of the nineteenth century's most influential British botanists however, included it in 1867 in the Droseraceae. In 1912, Johannes Gottfried Hallier regarded Roridula as a specialized member of the Clethraceae. Hutchinson in 1959, and Arthur Cronquist in 1981 included it in the Byblidaceae. Current insights in the relationships of the Roridulaceae, based on a 2015 DNA-analysis, are summarized in the following tree. Distribution, habitat and ecology Pameridea marlothi on Roridula dentata'Synema marlothiThe genus Roridula is endemic to parts of the mountains in the west and southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa. R. dentata can be found in the mountains of Tulbagh, Clanwilliam and Ceres. R. gorgonias occurs between Somerset West and Swellendam. Both species grow on acidic and nutrient-poor, sandy soils, in locations that are relatively moist, at altitudes of 900–1200 m (2950–3950 ft) for R. dentata and 150–925 m (500–3000 ft) for R. gorgonias. The seeds of Roridula dentata germinate shortly after a fire has destroyed the vegetation. Flowering mostly occurs in September and December. Like many other carnivorous plants, Roridula has a rather poorly developed root system, and grows on acidic and leached soils in humid locations. Roridula shares its habitat with several Drosera species. Like Drosera, R. gorgonias strongly absorbs UV and this is assumed to attract flying insects. Both Drosera and Roridula trap large numbers of various flying insects. Unlike Drosera, Roridula gorgonias secretes a very sticky resinous substance, mainly containing acylglycerides and triterpenoids that are insoluble in water. This implies that insects can even be trapped during rainy weather. Roridula does not respond by bending tentacles to struggling insects, unlike Drosera, that secrete a sticky mixture of saccharides or proteins. Instead, it carries three types of glandular hairs that differ in size: long, medium, and short. The long tentacles are less sticky, and by struggling, the insect comes in contact with the much more sticky medium and short glands, which completely immobilize it. Carnivorous plants like Drosera secrete enzymes that break down proteins (so-called proteases) from the captured insects, and so make available nitrates to these plants, that grow in soils with low ammonium and nitrate content. R. gorgonias however lacks proteases and is thus unable to extract these nutrients from trapped prey directly. Instead, each plant houses individuals of the bug Pameridea roridulae, which quickly close in on the trapped insects and feed on them. The bugs consequently defecate on the leaves. In a nitrogen-15 tracing experiment, where prey insects enriched with the rare heavy nitrogen isotope were eaten by Pameridea bugs, the share of N15 increased, showing that the plant had taken up nitrogen nutrients from the captured insects. Pameridea was shown to have a thick greasy layer that prevents direct contact between the resin on Roridula tentacles and the insect's cuticle, this allows the them to roam freely across the plants. R. dentata also has a hemipteran resident, Pameridea marlothi, and may receive nitrogen nutrients in much the same way. In addition, several crab spider species of the genus Synema can be found on the plant and these may both prey on the captive insects as well as on the resident bugs. The unrelated Australian genus Byblis resembles Roridula in having sticky tentacles, which do not secrete digestive enzymes and also lives together with hemipteran bugs in much the same way. Pameridea is assigned to the Miridae, a family of bugs that further live from sucking plant juices. Although Pameridea depends on insects with their high protein content that have been captured by Roridula for completing its life cycle, it can survive on plant juices. In case of a fire, the bugs probably evacuate their home plant and fly off. Even if they do not find another Roridula specimen, the bugs can sit out the period until Roridula plants have germinated and sufficiently grown, by sucking juices of other plant species. Fossil record Fragments of fossil leaves, morphologically very close to extant Roridula, have been found in two pieces of amber of Eocene age (35–47 million years old), from the Yantarny mine near Kaliningrad. These leaf tips are set with both non-glandular hairs and stalked glands (or tentacles), and have a linear-triangular shape that narrows to a terminal stalked gland. The hairs are on both surfaces and the margins, consist of a single cell, taper to a point, and are 10 to 80 μm long. The stalked glands are restricted to the margins and lower surface. The glands consist of many cells, forming a tapering stalk and a thick, hoof-shaped or egg-shaped head, with a small pore at its very tip. The stalks are 20–350 μm long (one stalk reaching 1.4 mm), the heads 20–120 μm long and 10–40 μm wide. Organic remains and hairs of other plant species are positioned on the heads, suggesting these were sticking to a secretion from the heads. The surface of the leaf consists of small six-sided cells at the base of the leaf and long, larger cells from the center to the tip of the leaf. These epidermal cells are 3–54 μm long and 6–18 μm wide. Stomata of 20–38 μm long and 15–25 μm wide are restricted to the underside of the leaf. Leaf shape, size and shape of the stomata and epidermal cells, the presence of non-glandular hairs, and of stalked glands that strongly differ in size on the lower leaf surface and on the margins including a terminal tentacle, as well as the head of the tentacle having an apical pore, are all characters shared with extant Roridula species. These fossils differ from today's dewsticks in having smaller tentacles, and in lacking a prominent midrib on the underside of the leaf. The pieces of amber with the roridulid remains were found in a deposit formed in a forested swamp on a nutrient-poor and carbonate-free soil in a coastal area, with both angiosperm and conifer trees in a warm-temperate or subtropical climate. The presence of roridulids in the northern hemisphere during the Eocene questions the assumption that the family originated in Gondwana, about 90 million years ago. Use Early settlers in parts of the Cape used to hang Roridula branches from the ceiling to catch flies.

He was the father of Oswaldo Goeldi, a noted Brazilian engraver and illustrator. Biography Goeldi studied zoology in Jena, Germany with Ernst Haeckel, and in 1884 he was invited by Ladislau de Souza Mello Netto, the influential director of the Brazilian Museu Imperial e Nacional, to work at that institution. Goeldi arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 1885 to work in the National Museum (now the Museu Nacional do Rio de Janeiro. In May 1890, he was fired, due to political circumstances related to the proclamation of the republic and the exile of his principal benefactor, Emperor D. Pedro II. He was then invited by the governor of the state of Pará, Lauro Sodré, to reorganize the Pará Museum of Natural History and Ethnography, in Belém, which had been founded in 1866 by Domingos Soares Ferreira Penna. He arrived on 9 June 1894 in Belém. In his pioneering work, Goeldi was helped by several other foreign researchers, such as the Swiss botanist Jacques Huber (1867–1914), zoologist Emilie Snethlage (1868–1929), geologists Friedrich Katzer (1861–1925), and Alexander Karl von Kraatz-Koschlau (1867–1900), and Adolpho Ducke (1876–1959), entomologist, ethnographer and botanist. In 1902, the Museu Paraense de História Natural e Ethnography was renamed in his honour. It is now called the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi. In 1905 Émil Goeldi renounced his post, due to ill health, and returned to Switzerland where he died in Bern, in 1917, at age 58. Hüber, then Snethlage and Ducke succeeded him as general directors of the Goeldi Museum in Belém. Contributions Goeldi was primarily a zoologist and described many new Brazilian species of birds and mammals. Some of the species which bear his name are: * Goeldi's antbird - Myrmeciza goeldii * Goeldi's marmoset - Callimico goeldii * Goeldi's frog - Flectonotus goeldii Several other species were named in honour of Émil Goeldi, such as: * Acropyga goeldii, Camponotus goeldii, Azteca goeldii, Pachycondyla goeldii, Crematogaster torosa goeldii, Mycocepurus goeldii, Procryptocerus goeldii, Acanthoponera goeldii, Brachymyrmex goeldii, Dorymyrmex goeldii dubius, Paratrechina goeldii, Megalomyrmex goeldii, Myrmelachista goeldii, Neivamyrmex goeldii, Solenopsis goeldii, Pheidole goeldii and Cephalotes goeldii, all species of South American ants described by Auguste Forel; * Protambulyx goeldii, a moth; * Dubioniscus goeldii, a garden pillbug (isopod); * Megaelosia goeldii and Fritziana goeldii, frogs; * Trichomycterus goeldii, a pencil catfish; * Cynopotamus goeldii, a Characidae fish; * Goeldi's pimelodid, Duopalatinus goeldii, a Pimelodidae freshwater fish; * Goeldi's hemiodus, Hemiodus goeldii, a Hemiodontidae freshwater fish. * Cheirocerus goeldii, also a catfish; * Simulium goeldii, a blackfly from the Amazon Rainforest; * Philodendron goeldii, a philodendron plant. =In other scientific fields= Goeldi was also recognized as an important early figure in public health and epidemiology in Brazil, because he studied the mechanism of transmission of yellow fever and advocated the importance of fighting the mosquito as the vector of the disease, several years before Oswaldo Cruz did so. His extensive scientific research on the geography, geology, flora, fauna, archaeology, ethnography and socio-economical conditions of the present day region of Amapá was very important to end the Contestado territorial litigation between France and Brazil, ceding the territory to Brazil on 1 December 1900, by the international decision of the court of Bern.

Buildings viewed from left to right: The Echo Chalet, Echo Mountain House, Incline Powerhouse, Dormitories, and Car Barn. Behind the car barn, note an inflatable reservoir for the storage of hydrogen gas produced in Pasadena and piped some to Echo. Echo Mountain is also known for its incredible echoes. Echo Mountain was shaped from an alluvial fan between Rubio and Las Flores canyons. It is geographically defined by Castle Canyon to its leeward side, Rubio Canyon at its foot, and Las Flores Canyon on its windward side. Echo has a mean elevation of . It is most visible as a short mountain extension whose ridge protrudes below the peak of Inspiration Point. Echo Mountain's name is derived from the number of repetitions one's voice could emit into Castle Canyon. Boy Scout projects were made to find the \\"sweet spot\\" where the largest number of repetitions could be heard. During the days of the Mount Lowe Railway \\"echophones\\" were set up to assist in voice projections near the best sweet spots. History Replica of an \\"echophone\\" mounted over the edge of Castle Canyon for visitors' use. The few echophones that still exist are part of personal or museum collections. On 6 January 1993, Echo Mountain, also referred to as Mount Echo, was delineated as part of the Mount Lowe Railway monument area listed by the U.S. Forest Service on the National Register of Historic Places. On top of the mountain are the ruins of \\"White City\\", a resort along the scenic Mount Lowe Railway, which could easily be seen from the valley below.

And so, when I began getting into model airplanes, and getting into contests and creating new things, I probably got more psychological benefit from that than I would have from some of the other typical school things.\\" MacCready graduated from Hopkins School in 1943 and then trained as a US Navy pilot before the end of World War II. He received a BS in physics from Yale University in 1947, an MS in physics from Caltech in 1948, and a PhD in aeronautics from Caltech in 1952. In 1951, MacCready founded his first company, Meteorology Research Inc, to do atmospheric research. Some of MacCready's work as a graduate student involved cloud seeding, and he was an early pioneer of the use of aircraft to study meteorological phenomena. Career and Achievements He started gliding after World War II and was a three-time winner (1948, 1949, 1953) of the Richard C. du Pont Memorial Trophy, awarded annually to the U.S. National Open Class Soaring Champion. In 1956, he became the first American pilot to become the World Soaring Champion. He invented a device that told pilots the best speed to fly a glider, depending on conditions and based on the glider's rate of sink at different air-speeds. Sailplane pilots still use the \\"MacCready speed ring\\", and still adjust the \\"MacCready Number\\" (abbreviated MC) within their flight instruments, to optimize their flying speed. In the 1970s, he guaranteed a business loan for a friend, which subsequently failed, leaving him with a $100,000 debt. This was the motivation he needed to compete for the £50,000 Kremer prize for human-powered flight, which had been on offer for 18 years. With Dr. Peter B.S. Lissaman, he created a human-powered aircraft, the Gossamer Condor. The Condor stayed aloft for seven minutes while it completed the required figure eight course, thereby winning the first Kremer prize in 1977. The award-winning plane was constructed of aluminium tubing, plastic foam, piano wire, bicycle parts, and mylar foil for covering. Kremer then offered another £100,000 for the first human-powered crossing of the English Channel. MacCready took up the challenge and in 1979, he built the Condor's successor, the Gossamer Albatross, and won the second Kremer prize, successfully flying from England to France. He also received the Collier Trophy, which is awarded annually for the greatest achievement in aeronautics or astronautics, for his design and construction of the Albatross.The Gossamer Penguin in flight He later created solar-powered aircraft such as the Gossamer Penguin and the Solar Challenger. He was involved in the development of NASA's solar-powered flying wings such as the Helios, which surpassed the SR-71's altitude records and could theoretically fly on Mars (where the atmosphere is thin and has little oxygen). MacCready also collaborated with General Motors on the design of the Sunraycer, a solar-powered car, and then on the EV-1 electric car. In 1985, he was commissioned to build a halfscale working replica of the pterosaur Quetzalcoatlus for the Smithsonian Institution, following a workshop in 1984, which concluded that such a replica was feasible. The completed remote-controlled flying reptile, with a wingspan of 18 feet, was filmed over Death Valley, California in 1986 for the Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. It flew successfully several times before being severely damaged in a crash at an airshow at Andrews AFB in Maryland. The launch of the pterosaur model came off well but the radio transmitter link failed, perhaps due to the interference from some of the many base communications devices. The model nosed over and crashed at the runway side, breaking at the neck from the force of impact. MacCready helped to sponsor the Nissan Dempsey/MacCready Prize which has helped to motivate developments in racing-bicycle technology, applying aerodynamics and new materials to allow for faster human-powered vehicles. He was the founder (in 1971) and Chairman of AeroVironment Inc., a public company (AVAV) that develops unmanned surveillance aircraft and advance power systems. AV recently flew a prototype of the first airplane to be powered by hydrogen fuel cells, the Global Observer. MacCready died on August 28, 2007 from metastatic melanoma. He was an atheist and a skeptic. He was survived by his wife Judy, his three sons Parker, Tyler and Marshall and two grandchildren.

He was involved with scientific skepticism from its early days, being a member of the board of directors of the Southern California Skeptics in 1985. Skeptic and author Michael Shermer credits MacCready with his introduction to the skeptical movement. MacCready was admitted posthumously to the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry's Pantheon of Skeptics in 2011. Since 2013, MacCready has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. MacCready was also a passionate environmentalist who was concerned about humanity's role in the depletion of natural resources. \\"Environmentally conscious, technologically clever, and culturally grand, Paul wanted to change the world through reason, intelligence, and creativity\\", Shermer wrote of him in an obituary. Appearances MacCready lectured widely at both industry and educational venues, with an emphasis on creativity. Enthusiastic about spreading his message to as many as possible, he would speak to anyone he thought he could influence, including children. Michael Shermer described his delivery as \\"completely unpretentious, conversing in the same manner whether he was talking to a room full of undergraduate students or Nobel laureates and Pulitzer Prize winners.\\" In February 1998, MacCready spoke at a TED conference on the topic of nature versus humans, continuing his environmental theme of \\"doing more with less\\".

Originally named Oak Mountain, it was renamed for Professor Thaddeus S.C. Lowe, who is credited for being the first person to set foot on and plant the American flag at its peak, and who built the Mount Lowe Railway to its foot in 1896. The record of the naming was made official by Andrew McNally, the famous Chicago map printer and summertime resident of Altadena, who promised to print \\"Mount Lowe\\" on all his maps. Mt. Lowe was established as an alternate route for the Mount Lowe Railway when attempts to procure rights of way to the more prominent Mount Wilson had failed. A number of trails stem from it due to the Mount Lowe Tavern which was built at Crystal Springs below the summit and operated from 1895 to 1936. One of the historic trails was the \\"Mount Lowe Eight\\" which was a mule ride attraction of the hotel that made a figure eight shaped route starting at the Tavern, ascending the summit of Mt. Lowe, returning to the Tavern, and crisscrossing to a trail that headed down Castle Canyon. From there the trail passed down to the Echo Mountain resort and ascended on the return to the Tavern. Mount Lowe was the upper terminus of the Alpine Division of the Mount Lowe Railway originally incorporated by Professor Lowe as the Pasadena and Mt. Wilson Railroad Co. Mt. Lowe is approachable from Echo Mountain or Chaney trail via a fire road which was graded over the old railway right-of-way.  See also * Mount Lowe Railway * Thaddeus S. C.

He is the best known member of the Traditionalist Catholic \\"Tridentine\\" movement in Ireland and is also known for ordaining the singer Sinéad O'Connor. He is the founder and bishop superior of the Irish Orthodox Catholic and Apostolic Church. Early life Cox was an Irish soldier and a Dún Laoghaire harbour policeman.  Ministry  Cox was consecrated as a bishop in 1978 by Ciarán Broadbery, Here Ciarán Broadbery is spelled \\"Kieran Broadberry\\". who in turn was consecrated in 1977 by Clemente Domínguez y Gómez of the independent Palmarian Catholic Church. Domínguez was consecrated in January 1976 by Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of the Roman Catholic Church. In September 1976, Thục, and those he had ordained, were excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church. Cox offered Tridentine Masses at Monkstown, County Dublin, in the mid-1980s. Cox's church is St Coleman's, in the townland of Cree near Birr, County Offaly. In May 1998, Cox consecrated a Roman Catholic priest, Patrick Buckley, as a bishop. According to a British journal, The Tablet, it was said at the time that Buckley's consecration was \\"valid but illicit\\" but that the Catholic Media Office of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales \\"has now said that it doubts that the bishop's episcopal consecration is valid\\". Irish issues within the Roman Catholic Church, however, fall under the jurisdiction of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference; in June 1998, Jim Cantwell, director of the Irish Catholic Press and Information Office, said that Cox's consecration of Buckley was valid but illicit. In April 1999, Cox ordained female rock singer Sinéad O'Connor as a priest. Her ordination ceremony, after six weeks of theological study, was held in a Lourdes hotel bedroom. O'Connor then assumed the religious name of \\"Mother Bernadette Mary\\".\\"O'Connor becomes a 'priest'\\", BBC, 4 May 1999. In 2001, Cox planned to convert his commercial fishing trawler, called The Little Bishop, into \\"a mobile floating church, offering on-board marriages and baptisms to people around the British Isles.\\" Cox planned to protest against the ship being sailed into Ireland by the pro- choice feminist group Women on Waves. In 2004, Cox's trawler, called The Patriarch, caught fire while underway and sank. Cox also planned to use The Patriarch as a church. In 2011, Cox was a candidate in the general election for the Laois–Offaly constituency, coming last with 60 votes.Laois-Offaly - 2011 Candidates , RTÉ News, 25 February 2011. In 2013, a District Court judge requested that the Garda Síochána investigate a marriage conducted by Cox for a 17-year-old Traveller youth and his partner. Civil marriages in Ireland require that the participants are over 18, or have a Court Exemption Order if this is not the case. Cox states that such weddings conducted by him are religious, not civil, so there is no religious reason why somebody 16 years old should not get married. Cox insists on parental consent and parents being present at the ceremony.

She was the only ship of her class and was the first large warship built in Germany after the end of World War I. She was built at the Reichsmarinewerft in Wilhelmshaven; her keel was laid down in December 1921 and her completed hull was launched in January 1925. Emden was commissioned into the fleet in October 1925. Her design was heavily informed by the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles and the dictates of the Allied disarmament commission. Displacement was capped at , though like all German warships built in the period, Emden exceeded the size limitations. She was armed with a main battery of surplus guns left over from World War I, mounted in single gun turrets, as mandated by the Allied powers. She had a top speed of . Emden spent the majority of her career as a training ship; in the inter- war period, she conducted several world cruises to train naval cadets, frequently visiting East Asia, the Americas, and the Indian Ocean region. In 1937 and 1938, she briefly participated in the non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War. At the outbreak of war, she laid minefields off the German coast and was damaged by a British bomber that crashed into her. She participated in the invasion of Norway in April 1940 as part of the force that captured the Norwegian capital at Oslo. The ship thereafter resumed training duties in the Baltic Sea. These lasted with minor interruptions until September 1941, when she was assigned to the Baltic Fleet and tasked with supporting German operations during the invasion of the Soviet Union. Training duties resumed in 1942 and lasted until late 1944, when she took part in minelaying operations in the Skagerrak. Damaged in a grounding accident in December 1944, she went to Königsberg for repairs. In January 1945, she participated in the evacuation of East Prussia to escape the advancing Soviet Army. While undergoing repairs in Kiel, Emden was repeatedly damaged by British bombers and later run aground outside the harbor to prevent her from sinking. In the final days of the war, she was blown up to prevent her capture. The wreck was ultimately broken up in place by 1950. Design , the basis of Emdens design According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles, the treaty that ended World War I, the German Navy was permitted only six light cruisers. Article 190 limited new cruiser designs to and prohibited new construction until the vessel to be replaced was at least twenty years old.Treaty of Versailles Part V, Section II: Naval Clauses, Articles 181 and 190 Since the six cruisers that German retained had been launched between 1899 and 1902, the oldest ships—, , , , and —could be replaced immediately. Design work on the first new light cruiser, ordered as \\"Ersatz Niobe\\", began in 1921. The Navy hoped to finish the ship as quickly as possible and to keep costs to a minimum, and so requested permission from the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control to use steam turbines, boilers, and conning towers from scrapped vessels to complete Ersatz Niobe. The NIACC rejected the request. The Navy also hoped to use an armament of four twin-gun turrets for the new ship. The NIACC rejected the twin-turret design, but allowed the use of guns from existing stocks of spare barrels. Nominally within the 6,000-ton limit of the Versailles Treaty, Emden in fact exceeded the restriction by almost fully loaded. In 1923, after work on Emden had already begun, the Germans proposed using the definition for standard displacement adopted in the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which was significantly less than full-load displacement. The Allied powers approved of the change, and thus Emden, which had a standard displacement of just under the 6,000-ton limit, was retroactively made legal. The ship was based on the blueprints from the late-war cruiser , primarily due to personnel shortages in the design staff and the closure of the Navy's Ship Testing Institute, and the blueprints for Karlsruhe were still available. Completed to a dated design, she proved to be something of a disappointment in service, primarily owing to her weak broadside of just six 15 cm guns. Nevertheless, the ship incorporated major advances over the earlier designs, including large-scale use of welding in her construction and a significantly more efficient propulsion system that gave her a cruising radius fifty percent larger than that of the older ships, which proved to be quite useful on the extended training cruises of the 1920s and 1930s. =General characteristics= Emden was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a designed draft of ; at standard load, the draft was , and at combat load the draft increased to . Her designed displacement was , with standard and combat displacements. Her hull was constructed with longitudinal steel frames and incorporated seventeen watertight compartments and a double bottom that extended for 56 percent of the length of the keel. She had a waterline armored belt that was thick; her armored deck was thick, and her conning tower had thick sides. The ship had a standard crew of nineteen officers and 464 enlisted men. While serving on cadet training cruises, her crew numbered twenty-nine officers and 445 enlisted, with 162 cadets. After 1940, her standard crew was increased to twenty-six officers and 556 enlisted, and after being reduced to a training ship, her crew numbered thirty officers and 653 enlisted men. Emden carried six boats. The German Navy regarded the ship as a good sea boat, with slight lee helm and gentle motion in a swell. The cruiser was maneuverable, but was slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. She lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns. She had a metacentric height of . =Machinery= A replacement engine built for Emden, displayed at the Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum (2011 picture) Emden was powered by two sets of Brown, Boveri & Co. geared steam turbines; they drove a pair of three-bladed screws that were in diameter. Steam was provided by four coal-fired Marine- type water-tube boilers and six oil-fired Marine water-tube boilers divided into four boiler rooms. The engines were rated at and a top speed of . On speed trials, her engines reached and a maximum of . The ship was designed to carry of coal, though additional space could accommodate up to . Oil capacity was as designed, and up to in additional fuel bunkers. This gave the ship a cruising radius of at . At , her range fell to . Electrical power was supplied by two systems of three generators each, with a total combined output of at 220 Volts. =Armament= The ship's main battery was to have been eight 15 cm SK L/55 guns in twin turrets, but the Allied disarmament authority refused to permit this armament. Instead, she was equipped with existing stocks of 15 cm SK L/45 guns in single turrets. The guns were C/16 models; they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . They could elevate to 40 degrees and had a maximum range of . The eight guns were supplied with a total of 960 rounds of ammunition. Emden was also equipped with two 8.8 cm SK L/45 anti-aircraft guns, and a third was later added. These guns had between 900 and 1,200 rounds of ammunition in total. As designed, she was to have carried eight deck- mounted torpedo tubes in dual launchers, but only four tubes were fitted as built. In 1934, these were replaced with more powerful tubes. The ship carried twelve torpedoes. In 1938, the ship's anti-aircraft battery was strengthened. She received two and later four 3.7 cm SK C/30 guns and up to eighteen 2 cm Flak guns. The capacity to carry 120 mines was also added. In 1942, two of the four torpedo launchers were removed, and she was rearmed with a new model of 15 cm gun. This gun was the Tbts KC/36 model, and was designed for use on destroyers. It fired a slightly smaller shell at a higher muzzle velocity—. The gun could elevate to 47 degrees for a maximum range of . By 1945, the ship's anti-aircraft battery consisted of nine 3.7 cm guns and six 2 cm guns. Service history =Construction – 1931= Emden in port, in 1928 Emden was laid down at the Reichsmarinewerft shipyard in Wilhelmshaven on 8 December 1921. Political instability and Germany's financial weakness in the early 1920s delayed construction of the ship, and she was launched on 7 January 1925. Admiral Hans Zenker gave a speech at her launching, and the ship was christened by the widow of Karl von Müller, who had commanded the original during World War I. The new cruiser was commissioned into the fleet nine months later, on 15 October 1925. Intended for use as a training ship for naval cadets, Emden was assigned to the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station); she began sea trials after entering service, and these were interrupted with alterations in the Reichsmarinewerft that included a reconstruction of the battle mast. After these were completed in 1926, she conducted individual training and made numerous visits to foreign ports in northern European waters. In August and September 1926, she took part in annual fleet maneuvers, and in October she returned to the shipyard again to have her aft funnel increased in height to match the forward one. Emden was at that time allocated to the Training Inspectorate of the Navy. Emden embarked on her first long-range training cruise on 14 November 1926 from Wilhelmshaven. The ship traveled to south around Africa and across the Indian Ocean, where she stopped in the Cocos Islands, where the wreck of the original Emden was still present. The crew held a memorial service there on 15 March 1927 before continuing on to East Asian waters. She visited ports in Japan before crossing the northern Pacific Ocean to Alaska and then steamed down the western coast of North America, calling in various harbors along the way. Emden continued south through Central and South American waters, crossing into the Atlantic Ocean and turning north; the ship was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 25 December. She returned to Germany by way of the Azores and Vilagarcía, Spain, arriving in Wilhelmhaven on 14 March 1928. The ship spent much of the rest of the year preparing for the next major cruise, which began on 5 December. By this time, the ship had come under the command of Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Lothar von Arnauld de la Perière, who had come aboard in September. The ship steamed down to the Mediterranean Sea and stopped in Istanbul, Turkey, before traveling south through the Suez Canal, across the Indian Ocean to the Dutch East Indies, and then to Australia. Emden then crossed the Pacific to Hawaii before proceeding to the west coast of the United States. She then steamed south to the Panama Canal, which she transited to the Caribbean Sea. The ship then crossed to Las Palmas in the Canary Islands before returning to Wilhelmshaven, which she reached on 13 December 1929. Emden departing Shanghai in 1931 On 13 January 1930, Emden left Wilhelmshaven on her third voyage abroad. She steamed into the Atlantic and stopped in Madeira before crossing over to tour several ports in the Caribbean, including Saint Thomas in the US Virgin Islands, New Orleans and Charleston in the US, Kingston, Jamaica, and San Juan, Puerto Rico. The ship recrossed the Atlantic, stopping in Las Palmas and Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the way, before arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 13 May 1930. There, she went into the shipyard for an extensive overhaul. In October, Fregattenkapitän (FK—Frigate Captain) Robert Witthoeft-Emden took command of the ship. Emden embarked on her next overseas cruise on 1 December. The ship initially cruised to Vigo, Spain before entering the Mediterranean. She stopped in Souda Bay, Crete and then transited the Suez Canal, stopping in Aden, Cochin, Colombo, Trincomalee, Port Blair as she crossed the Indian Ocean to Sabang in the Dutch East Indies. Emden then visited numerous ports in Southeast Asia, China, Japan, and the Pacific, including Bangkok, Victoria, Labuan, Manila, Nanking, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nii-jima, Tsuruga, Hakodate, Otaru, Yokohama, and Guam. Emden then crossed back through the Indian Ocean, stopping in Mauritius before arriving in South Africa; there, she stopped in Durban and East London, where a group of the ship's officers went to Johannesburg; there, they were received by J. B. M. Hertzog, the Prime Minister of South Africa. On the way back to Germany, the ship stopped in Lobito and Luanda in Portuguese Angola, Las Palmas, and Santander, Spain. She reached Wilhelmshaven on 8 December 1931. =1932–1939= On 1 January 1932, Emden, under the command of FK Werner Grassmann, was transferred from the Training Inspectorate to the Commander of Reconnaissance Forces, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Conrad Albrecht. During this period, the ship took part in training exercises with the fleet's scouting forces, including the annual fleet maneuvers in August and September. She also participated in a fleet training cruise into the Atlantic, during which she visited Funchal and Las Palmas with the light cruiser . Emden was decommissioned on 1 April 1933 for an extensive refit that involved the replacement of her four coal-fired boilers with oil-fired models. Both funnels were shorted by approximately and gaffs for the wireless transmitters were installed on the aft funnel. On returning to service on 29 September 1934, FK Karl Dönitz, the future commander of the Kriegsmarine, took command of the ship. At this time, she returned to the Training Inspectorate and resumed long-range cruises. The first such voyage began on 10 November, and included stops in Santa Cruz de La Palma, Cape Town and East London, Porto Amelia in Portuguese Mozambique, Mombasa, Kenya, Victoria, Seychelles, Trincomalee, and Cochin. On the way back home, she entered the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal and visited Alexandria, Cartagena, Ponta Delgada, Lisbon, and Vigo, before anchoring in the Schillig roadstead outside Wilhelmshaven on 12 June 1935. Emden in Lisbon in 1935 Emden started her sixth major training cruise on 23 October, under the command of Kapitän zur See (KzS—Captain at Sea) Johannes Bachmann, which went to the Americas. She crossed the Atlantic by way of the Azores, toured the West Indies and visited Venezuela, before passing through the Panama Canal to Guayaquil, Ecuador on 25 December. She then steamed north to Puerto San José, Guatemala before continuing on to Portland, Oregon and then crossing over to Hawaii. From there, she returned to Central America, crossed back through the Panama Canal, visited more islands in the West Indies, and then cruised the eastern coast of North America, stopping in Baltimore and Montreal. The ship then recrossed the Atlantic to Pontevedra, Spain and returned to Germany, arriving on 11 June 1936. In August, Bachmann was replaced by KzS Walter Lohmann. The next major training cruise began on 10 October; Emden steamed to the Mediterranean Sea and visited Cagliari on the island of Sardinia, and passed through the Dardanelles to Istanbul, and continued on through the Bosporus to the Black Sea. There, she stopped in Varna, Bulgaria, before returning to the Mediterranean and steaming through the Suez Canal. The ship stopped in British Ceylon on her way to East Asia, where she visited ports in Thailand, China, and Japan. On the way back to Germany, she stopped in Padang in the Dutch East Indies and Bombay, India. Another trip through the Suez Canal brought the ship back to the Mediterranean; she stopped in Algeciras, Spain on 15 April 1937, passed through the English Channel three days later, and reached Voslapp, Germany on the 19th. The ship finally returned to Wilhelmshaven on 23 April. On 11 October 1937, Emden began her eighth major cruise, departing Wilhelmshaven for the Mediterranean under the command of FK Leopold Bürkner. There, she joined the German naval forces that had been sent to the non-intervention patrols enforcing the arms embargo on Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Emden remained here for only a few days, from 16 to 18 October, before continuing on through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean. There, she stopped in a variety of foreign ports, including Massawa in Italian Eritrea, Colombo in British Ceylon, Mormugao, India, and Belawan and Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies. On her return to the Mediterranean, she briefly rejoined the non-intervention patrols off the Spanish coast from 14 to 21 March 1938. She then continued on to Amsterdam and ultimately arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 23 April. In June, KzS Paul Wever relieved Bürkner in preparation for the next major cruise, which began on 26 July. Emden steamed north to Norway, then crossed the North Atlantic to Iceland, stopping in Reykjavik before turning south to the Azores and Bermuda. There, she stopped in Hamilton from 30 August to 3 September; the visit proved to be an unfriendly one, as international opinion had turned decidedly against Nazi Germany during the Sudeten crisis. Indeed, a planned visit to Havana, Cuba was cancelled and Emden was recalled to Germany. She stopped in Funchal from 10 to 15 September on the way back to Wilhelmshaven, though before she arrived the Munich Agreement that ended the crisis had been signed, and so international tensions decreased enough to allow Emden to continue the training cruise. The ship turned south and entered the Mediterranean and later the Black Sea. She was present in Istanbul from 19 to 23 October, when the funeral for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of Turkey, was held. Emden returned to Germany by way of Rhodes and Vigo, arriving in Wilhelmshaven on 16 December. From 29 March to 15 April 1939, Emden was used as a fishery protection ship. During this period, she visited Reykjavik. In May, Wever left the ship and his place was taken by KzS Werner Lange. =World War II= After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Emden took part in laying a defensive minefield off the German coast in the North Sea on 3 September, along with several light cruisers and destroyers. The barrier stretched across the German Bight from the coast of the Netherlands to the Jutland peninsula; the purpose of the minefield was to secure the seaward flank of the Westwall. She conducted the operation with the other light cruisers Nürnberg, Leipzig, Köln, and Königsberg and sixteen destroyers. After laying her first set of mines, she returned to Wilhelmshaven to restock her mines. While Emden was moored in the harbor, a force of ten British Blenheim bombers attacked the port on 4 September; German anti- aircraft gunners in the city shot down four of the five bombers, one of which inadvertently crashed into the ship. Nine men from Emden were killed and another twenty were wounded in the crash; these were among the first casualties of the German fleet during the war. Emden then transferred to the Baltic, where she was assigned to commerce protection duties. She returned to Wilhelmshaven for periodic maintenance from 2 December to 3 January 1940, after which she resumed training duties. During the shipyard period, a degaussing coil was installed just above the waterline to protect the ship from magnetic mines and her anti-aircraft armament was strengthened. After the work was completed, Emden returned to training duties through the winter of 1939–1940. Operation Weserübung View from Emdens deck, following behind Blücher and Lützow on the way to Oslo, 8 April 1940 As Germany assembled forces for the invasion of Norway, codenamed Operation Weserübung, Emden was allocated to Group 5, which was tasked with seizing Oslo. She joined the group as it began forming in Swinemünde on 12 March. The group consisted of the flagship, the heavy cruisers and Lützow, three torpedo boats, and eight R-type minesweepers. On the night of 5 April, Emden and Blücher conducted searchlight training to prepare for night operations. The following day, Emden embarked 600 soldiers and their equipment in Swinemünde before proceeding to the collection point for the invasion fleet, Strander Bucht outside Kiel. At 03:00 on 8 April, Group 5 left Strander Bucht and steamed to the Oslofjord, where they arrived at midnight. After reaching the approaches to the fjord, Emden transferred 350 of the men to the R-boats to allow them to go ashore. The element of surprise was lost, however, and on entering the narrows in the fjord, Blücher was engaged and sunk by Norwegian coastal defenses at Oscarsborg Fortress in the Battle of Drøbak Sound. Lützow was also damaged before the Germans broke off the attack. After the loss of Blücher, Emden and Lützow disembarked their troops further down the fjord so they could attack the coastal defenses from the rear. Once the ground troops had begun their attack, Emden and Lützow closed with the Oscarborg fortress at 15:55 and began providing covering fire. The Germans then negotiated surrender terms with the other Norwegian forces later on 9 April. Emden entered the port on the morning of 10 April, thereafter serving as a joint communications center to coordinate Kriegsmarine, Wehrmacht, and Luftwaffe operations. She was relieved of this duty on 24 April, though she remained in Oslo until 7 June. During this period, Großadmiral (Grand Admiral) Erich Raeder visited the ship on 17 May. Emden arrived back in Swinemünde on 8 June, where she resumed training duties. Baltic operations Emden underway in the Oslofjord in late summer 1941 From 7 November to 15 February 1941, the ship was in dry dock for maintenance. In September, she was assigned to the Baltic Fleet, centered on the newly commissioned battleship ; the Baltic Fleet was tasked with preventing the Soviet Navy from breaking out of the Baltic. Emden and Leipzig were the core of the southern group, which was based in Libau. The fleet remained on station only briefly, and when it became clear that the Soviet fleet had remained in port, the German Baltic Fleet was dissolved. On 16 September, Emden was operating off Dagö with Leipzig and three torpedo boats; the ships came under fire from Soviet coastal batteries, but were undamaged. A group of four Soviet torpedo boats also made an unsuccessful attack on the German squadron. Emden again provided gunfire support to German troops fighting on the Sworbe Peninsula from 26 to 27 September. Later on the 27th, the ship was transferred to Gotenhafen. She was assigned to the newly formed Training Unit of the Fleet in November 1941, and she would remain attached to the unit for the rest of the war. From June to November 1942, the ship was thoroughly overhauled in Wilhelmshaven, before returning to Gotenhafen on 7 November. Raeder again came aboard the ship for the voyage back to Gotenhafen; this was his last visit to a warship before his resignation. While on sea trials after the 1942 overhaul, Emden reached a speed of , significantly less than her original top speed. By that time, the ship had been in service for sixteen years and retained her original engines. Due for an engine replacement, the war situation prevented the work from being done and Emden soldiered on. The year 1943 passed uneventfully for Emden, though she received a strengthened anti-aircraft battery that included and a pair of Bofors guns. The ship took part in a pair of minelaying operations in the Skagerrak in late 1944, the first from 19 to 21 September and the second from 5 to 6 October. The increasing frequency of Allied air attacks on the minelaying operations led to their cancellation in late October. For the rest of the year, she was occupied with escorting convoys in the Baltic. On 1 November 1944, Emden assisted the cruiser Köln, which had run aground. Emden herself ran aground in the Oslofjord on 9 December, though she was refloated the following day. She left Oslo on 23 December and steamed to Königsberg for repairs, arriving two days later. After entering the dry dock at the Schichau-Werke shipyard, her guns were removed and repair work began at a leisurely rate. She was there, still awaiting the completion of repairs when the Soviet Army attacked the city in January 1945, and on 23 January the naval high command ordered all naval forces in the city to evacuate. Emden had her guns reinstalled and she embarked the remains of Paul von Hindenburg and his wife, which had been disinterred to prevent them from falling into the hands of the advancing Soviet Army. She carried them to Pillau, under tow from several icebreakers, where they were transferred to the transport ship . In Pillau, Emdens engines were put back in working order, though she was only able to use one of her propellers. Emden then steamed as fast as was possible to Kiel, where she arrived on 6 February. There, she went into drydock at the Deutsche Werke shipyard for repairs. While in Deutsche Werke, Emden was under continuous air attacks. An air raid on 11 March set the forward deck and port side torpedo launchers on fire with incendiary bombs. Another attack on 3 April scored a direct hit on the ship's forward funnel, destroying it. On the night of 9–10 April, an Allied bombing raid severely damaged the ships in Kiel; the heavy cruisers and were both destroyed by bombs and Emden was slightly damaged by a near miss astern. Further, more serious damage was done on 13 April, and the next morning she was towed out into Heikendorfer Bucht. She had a 15 degree list to port, but the crew managed to stop the flooding and seal the hull. To prevent her from sinking, she was run aground in the shallows, and was decommissioned on 26 April 1945. To prevent her capture by the advancing Allied armies, her crew destroyed the ship with explosives on 3 May, days before the end of World War II in Europe. The wreck was broken up for scrap in situ over the following five years. Her bow ornament is currently on display in the Deutsches Museum in Munich.

Ford (CVN-78) was moved to Pier 3 at Newport News Shipbuilding for 28 months of additional outfitting and testing. The A1B reactor plant is an aircraft carrier nuclear reactor developed by the United States Navy. It is used in Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers to provide electrical and propulsion energy. The A1B is the first naval reactor produced by Bechtel Corporation, which has \\"performed engineering and/or construction services on more than 80 percent of [land-based] nuclear plants in the United States\\". Aircraft carriers' nuclear reactors provide the electrical and motor energy of the ship by splitting enriched uranium to produce heat and convert water to steam to power steam turbines. This process is largely the same as in land-based nuclear power stations, the most notable difference being the direct use of turboshaft power for turning the ship's screws. Over decades of development several other design differences have emerged between naval reactors and the usually much larger power station reactors. As Navy planners developed requirements for the Gerald R. Ford class, they concluded that the A4W reactors that provide propulsion and electricity for the predecessor Nimitz- class aircraft carriers offer too little power for contemporary and anticipated future shipboard needs, so they commissioned a new reactor from Bechtel. The new reactor was named A1B, following the Navy's reactor- designation scheme of type, generation, and manufacturer: A for aircraft carrier, 1 for the maker's first reactor plant design, and B for Bechtel. Two A1B reactor plants will power each Gerald R. Ford class ship. It is estimated that the total thermal power output of the A1B will be around 700 MW, some 25% more than provided by the A4W. Improved efficiency in the total plant is expected to provide improved output to both propulsion and electrical systems. Using A4W data with a 25% increase in thermal power, the A1B reactors likely produce enough steam to generate of electricity, plus to power the four propeller shafts.104 MW + 25% = 130 MW x 2 = 260 MW (350,000 SHP.) The increased electrical generation capacity will allow for elimination of service steam on the ship, reducing staffing requirements for maintenance. Also, the use of Electrical aircraft catapults (EMALS) will free the ship's air wing from reactor plant constraints, in comparison to the steam catapults used for launching aircraft on Nimitz class carriers, which relied on steam supplied by the nuclear reactor. The A1B reactor uses modernized technology that is both more advanced and adaptable than previous reactor technology, is smaller and weighs less than the A4W, and has operator interfaces that are expected to be improved as well.

During his long and eventful reign, Bagrat sought to repress the great nobility and to secure Georgia's sovereignty from the Byzantine and Seljuqid empires. In a series of intermingled conflicts, Bagrat succeeded in defeating his most powerful vassals and rivals of the Liparitid family, bringing several feudal enclaves under his control, and reducing the kings of Lorri and Kakheti, as well as the emir of Tbilisi to vassalage. Like many medieval Caucasian rulers, he bore several Byzantine titles, particularly those of nobelissimos, curopalates, and sebastos. Early reign Coin of Bagrat IV, struck between 1060 and 1072. Bagrat was the son of the king George I () by his first wife Mariam of Vaspurakan. At the age of three, Bagrat was surrendered by his father as a hostage to the Byzantine emperor Basil II () as a price for George's defeat in the 1022 war with the Byzantines. The young child Bagrat spent the next three years in the imperial capital of Constantinople and was released in 1025. He was still in Byzantine territory when Basil died and was succeeded by his brother Constantine VIII (). Constantine ordered the retrieval of the young prince, but the imperial courier was unable to overtake Bagrat – he was already in the Georgian kingdom.Lynda Garland & Stephen Rapp. Mary 'of Alania': Woman and Empress Between Two Worlds, pp. 94–5. In: Lynda Garland (ed., 2006), Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience, 800–1200. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., . After George I died in 1027, Bagrat, aged eight, succeeded to the throne. Queen Dowager Mariam then returned to prominence and became a regent for her underage son. She shared the regency with the grandees, particularly Liparit IV, Duke of Trialeti, and Ivane, Duke of Kartli. By the time Bagrat became king, the Bagratids’ drive to complete the unification of all Georgian lands had gained irreversible momentum. The kings of Georgia sat at Kutaisi in western Georgia from which they ran all of what had been the Kingdom of Abkhazia and a greater portion of Iberia/Kartli; Tao/Tayk had been lost to the Byzantines while a Muslim emir remained in Tbilisi and the kings of Kakheti obstinately defended their autonomy in easternmost Georgia. Furthermore, the loyalty of great nobles to the Georgian crown was far from stable. During Bagrat's minority, the regency had advanced the positions of the high nobility whose influence he subsequently tried to limit when he assumed full ruling powers. Simultaneously, the Georgian crown was confronted with two formidable external foes: the Byzantine Empire and the rising Seljuq Turks. Although the Byzantine Empire and Georgia had centuries-long cultural and religious ties, and the Seljuqs posed a substantial threat to the empire itself, Constantinople's aggressiveness on the Caucasian political scene contributed to an atmosphere of distrust and recrimination, and prevented the two Christian nations from effective cooperation against the common threat. With assertion of the Georgian Bagratid hegemony in the Caucasus being the cornerstone of Bagrat's reign, his policy can be understood as the attempt to play the Seljuqs and Byzantines off against one another. Dynastic wars Bagrat IV's charter, 1060–1065 Shortly after Bagrat's ascension to the throne, Constantine VIII sent in an army to take over the key city-fortress of Artanuji (modern Ardanuç, Turkey) on behalf of the Georgian Bagratid prince Demetre, son of Gurgen of Klarjeti, who had been dispossessed by Bagrat IV's grandfather, Bagrat III, of his patrimonial fief at Artanuji early in the 1010s. Several Georgians nobles defected to the Byzantines, but Bagrat's loyal subjects put up a stubborn fight.Holmes, Catherine (2005), Basil II and the Governance of Empire (976–1025), p. 482. Oxford University Press, . Constantine's death in 1028 rendered the Byzantine invasion abortive, and, in 1030, Queen Mariam paid a visit to the new emperor Romanos III (). She negotiated a peace treaty, and returned with the high Byzantine title of curopalates for her son in 1032. Mariam also brought him the Byzantine princess Helena Argyre as wife. Helena was a daughter of Basil Argyros, brother of Emperor Romanos, and the marriage was a diplomatic effort to establish a strategic association. However, Helena's death shortly afterwards at Kutaisi presented the Georgian court with the opportunity to pursue yet another diplomatic initiative through Bagrat's marriage with Borena, daughter of the king of Alania, a Christian country in the North Caucasus. In 1033, the royal court faced another dynastic trouble, this time with Bagrat's half-brother Demetre, a son of George I of his second marriage with Alda of Alania. Demetre and Alda lived in Anacopia, a fortress in Abkhazia, which had been bequeathed to them by the late king George I. Although an attempt by some great nobles to exploit Demetre's possible aspirations to the throne in their opposition to Bagrat's rule failed, the Georgian court's efforts to win his loyalty also went in vain. Threatened by Bagrat, the dowager queen Alda defected to the Byzantines and surrendered Anacopia to the emperor Romanos III who honored her son Demetre with the rank of magistros.Alemany, Agusti (2000). Sources of the Alans: A Critical Compilation, p. 222. Brill Publishers, . In 1039, Demetre returned to Georgia with Byzantine troops. This time, he was supported by Liparit IV, of the Liparitid clan, the most powerful noble in Georgia.Robert Bedrosian, \\"Liparit IV Orbēlean\\", p. 586. In: Joseph Reese Strayer (1983), Dictionary of the Middle Ages. Scribner, . Liparit, as duke of the district of Trialeti and later as a commander-in-chief of the royal armies, had appeared as the defender of a boy-king Bagrat early in the 1030s. Liparit's military prowess had been demonstrated once again in 1034 when, at the head of a combined Georgian-Armenian army, he defeated a Shaddadid troops in Arran. In 1038, Liparit was on the verge of capturing the ancient Georgian capital of Tbilisi, which had been a Muslim stronghold since the 8th century. Fearing his growing power, the Georgian nobles persuaded Bagrat to withdraw Liparit's army and thus thwarted the plan. As a result, Liparit became a sworn enemy of the king and began actively cooperating with the Byzantines for vengeance on Bagrat and his nobles. On behalf of the pretender Demetre, Liparit enjoyed a series of successes against Bagrat. In spite of Demetre's death in 1042, Liparit continued his struggle in alliance with the Byzantines and David I of Lorri. After the defeat at Sasireti, Bagrat was left with the western provinces only. During the Seljuk campaigns in Anatolia in 1048, Liparit, who had been fighting on the Byzantine side, was captured at the Battle of Kapetrou. Bagrat took advantage of this, and returned to his eastern possessions. The king's fortunes were quickly reversed, however, upon Liparit's return from captivity. The rebellious duke forced Bagrat to flee to Constantinople where he was kept, as a result of Liparit's intrigues, for three years. In the absence of Bagrat (1050–1053), Liparit was an effective ruler of Georgia; he even installed Bagrat's son George as king and declared himself a regent. After Bagrat's return, Liparit again warred against him. Eventually in 1060 his followers conspired and surrendered the duke to King Bagrat, who forced him into a monastery. Now, Bagrat gained a momentum to restrict the power of dynastic princes, reduced the kings of Lorri and Kakheti to impotence, and briefly held Tbilisi.Suny, Ronald Grigor (1994), The Making of the Georgian Nation: 2nd edition, p. 33. Indiana University Press, Seljuk attacks In the 1060s, Bagrat faced with an even greater problem: the Seljuks under Alp Arslan started to penetrate the frontier regions of Georgia. Bagrat had to buy peace through marrying his niece to Alp Arslan sometime after 1064.John Andrew Boyle, William Bayne Fisher (ed., 1991), The Cambridge History of Iran, p. 62. Cambridge University Press, . She later married the Seljuk vizier Nizam al- Mulk. The Seljuk threat prompted the Georgian and Byzantine governments to seek a closer cooperation. To secure the alliance, Bagrat's daughter Mart’a (Maria) married, at some point between 1066 and 1071, the Byzantine co-emperor Michael VII Ducas. The choice of a Georgian princess was unprecedented, and it was seen in Georgia as a diplomatic success on Bagrat's side.Lynda Garland with Stephen H. Rapp Jr. (2006). Mart'a-Maria 'of Alania'. An Online Encyclopedia of Roman Emperors. Retrieved on 24 December 2007. On 10 December 1068, Alp Arslan accompanied by the kings of Lorri and Kakheti as well as the emir of Tbilisi again marched against Bagrat. The provinces of Kartli and Argveti were occupied and pillaged. Bagrat's long-time rivals, the Shaddadids of Arran, were given compensation: the fortresses of Tbilisi and Rustavi. After Alp Arslan left Georgia, Bagrat recovered Kartli in July 1068. Al-Fadl I b. Muhammad, of the Shaddadids, encamped at Isani (a suburb of Tbilisi on the left bank of the Mtkvari) and with 33,000 men ravaged the countryside. Bagrat defeated him, however, and forced the Shaddadid troops to flight. On the road through Kakheti, Fadl was taken prisoner by the local ruler Aghsartan. At the price of conceding several fortresses on the Iori River, Bagrat ransomed Fadl and received from him the surrender of Tbilisi where he reinstated a local emir on the terms of vassalage.V. Minorsky, \\"Tiflis\\", p. 754. In: M. Th. Houtsma, E. van Donzel (1993), E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936. Brill, . The last years of Bagrat's reign coincided with what Professor David Marshall Lang described as \\"the final débacle of eastern Christendom\\" — the Battle of Manzikert — in which Alp Arslan dealt a crushing defeat to the Byzantine army, capturing the emperor Romanos IV, who soon died in misery. Bagrat IV died the following year, on 24 November 1072, and was buried at the Chkondidi Monastery. The suzerainty over the troubled kingdom of Georgia passed to his son George II.Lang, David Marshall (1966), The Georgians, p. 111. Praeger Publishers.

If this interpretation is correct, Dushara would be more of a title than a proper name, but both the exact form of the name and its interpretation are disputed.  Worship  In Greek times, he was associated with Zeus because he was the chief of the Nabataean pantheon as well as with Dionysus.

Mercury and Nitro first began teaming together in 2004 in OVW, WWE's developmental territory in Louisville, Kentucky. Melina, who at the time was Nitro's actual girlfriend, joined them as their manager in February 2005. While working in OVW, Mercury and Nitro captured the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on one occasion. MNM were called up to the SmackDown! roster in April 2005, in which Mercury and Nitro went on to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. While in WWE, their ring personas was that of a trio of Hollywood celebrities, complete with a red carpet ring entrance, that had them accompanied by \\"paparazzi\\". The duo lost the title in July 2005. After their third and final reign ended in May 2006, Nitro and Melina blamed Mercury for the loss and attacked him, splitting the team. Nitro and Melina were let go from the SmackDown! roster and debuted on the Raw brand. In November 2006, MNM reunited for a brief period, before Mercury was released from his contract in March 2007. Concept Partly inspired by Paris Hilton, the concept behind the group was that they were Hollywood celebrities. Upon their debut on SmackDown!, they claimed to be the \\"hot new team on the scene\\", because of their good looks and celebrity status. As part of their in-ring personas, MNM had a distinctive ring entrance. They walked to the ring on a red carpet, while members of the \\"paparazzi\\" took photos of them. The male members of MNM usually wore fur coats to the ring. As they took them off, Melina suggestively rubbed their abs while removing the title belts from their pants, where they hung in an exaggerated phallic fashion. Melina had a signature entrance which involved her doing a split on the ring apron—from the floor—then bending forward and crawling under the bottom rope. History =Ohio Valley Wrestling (2004–2005)= MNM was formed in the former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) \\"farm territory\\" Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). Melina Perez, Johnny Nitro's real-life girlfriend, was introduced into the company in 2004 as his ex-girlfriend, an ally of Matt Cappotelli with whom Nitro was engaged in a scripted rivalry. Almost immediately, however, Perez betrayed Cappotelli and sided with Nitro. Together they introduced Joey Matthews to become MNM. While in OVW, Nitro and Matthews won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship once, holding it for over two months. =Tag Team Championship reigns (2005–2006)= MNM was called up to WWE's SmackDown! roster in April 2005, with Matthews undergoing a name change to \\"Joey Mercury\\". They made their debut during Carlito's interview segment Carlito's Cabana, where they interrupted an interview between Carlito and Rey Mysterio, and attacked Mysterio. This provoked a feud between MNM and Mysterio and his partner, Eddie Guerrero, over the WWE Tag Team Championship. Two weeks later, in their debut match on the SmackDown! brand, they defeated Mysterio and Guerrero to win the WWE Tag Team Championship after Guerrero refused to tag into the match. While Nitro and Mercury held the championship, Melina was placed in an angle with Heidenreich. She publicly mocked him and was the impetus for an attack on him by Nitro and Mercury. In July, MNM were scheduled to face Heidenreich in a two-on-one handicap match, but attacked him before the match started. Road Warrior Animal saved Heidenreich from the attack and as a result, Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal challenged Mercury and Nitro for the WWE Tag Team Championship at The Great American Bash. MNM lost the match and the championship to Heidenreich and Animal at The Great American Bash. The loss of the WWE Tag Team Championship was seen as \\"bad publicity\\" by Melina so she introduced Jillian Hall, a storyline spin doctor to repair their image. Hall got them a cover article in SmackDown! magazine, and began to introduce the team before and aid them during matches. In September 2005, Hall left the group to join John \\"Bradshaw\\" Layfield (JBL), who had lost a match to Rey Mysterio. Joey Mercury (left), Melina (bottom), and Johnny Nitro during their ring entrance at December to Dismember (2006) On the October 28 episode of SmackDown!, Mercury and Nitro were placed into a tag team title fatal four-way match against the teams of the Mexicools (Super Crazy and Psicosis), William Regal and Paul Burchill, and the WWE Tag Team Champions Legion of Doom 2005 (Heidenreich and Road Warrior Animal). During the match, Mercury and Nitro were able to perform the Snapshot on Heidenreich, to win the championship for a second time. MNM successfully defended the championship against Eddie Guerrero and Batista on the November 4 episode of SmackDown!. In December, they began a feud with the Mexicools, who earned the right to face MNM at Armageddon for the WWE Tag Team Championship. Before Armageddon however, on the December 16 episode of SmackDown!, MNM lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to Batista and Rey Mysterio. A storyline was begun before the match, where Melina attempted to seduce Batista into forfeiting the match. The storyline played over to the December 30 episode of SmackDown! when, before MNM invoked their rematch clause, Melina held a press conference in the ring where she claimed that Batista had sexually harassed her. During the tag team match, Mark Henry aided MNM in winning back the WWE Tag Team Championship. The following week, MNM defeated Batista and Mysterio in a steel cage match to retain the championship, Henry's aid. Henry was only with the group a short time before his contract was sold to Daivari in storyline. They went on to successfully defend the championship against The Mexicools and the team of Matt Hardy and Tatanka in early 2006. =Dissolution (2006–2007)= In April 2006, MNM were placed in an angle in which they found themselves in a losing streak against the team of Paul London and Brian Kendrick. In non-title tag team matches, singles matches, and even a six-man tag match, London and Kendrick defeated the duo every time. At the Judgment Day pay-per-view in May 2006, MNM lost the tag team championship to London and Kendrick. After the match, Nitro and Mercury started brawling, disbanding the group. Later that night, Melina lost a singles match against Jillian Hall and after slapping General Manager Theodore Long in anger, she and Nitro were fired from the SmackDown! brand in storyline. Off-screen, Nitro and Mercury did not get along, and WWE management decided to split the tag team and send Nitro and Melina to the Raw brand. In addition, Mercury was about to begin serving a suspension for violating the WWE Wellness program. After the team split, Nitro, alongside Melina, was quickly placed into the Intercontinental Championship picture, winning the title twice. In November, after serving his suspension and a brief stint back in OVW, Mercury returned to WWE, reuniting MNM to answer an open challenge put out by The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) for the December to Dismember pay-per-view. At the event, MNM lost to the Hardys. MNM and the Hardys met again at Armageddon as part of a four-way ladder match, which also included the teams of Dave Taylor and William Regal and Paul London and Brian Kendrick. During the match, which saw London and Kendrick retain the WWE Tag Team Championship, Mercury was legitimately injured when he was struck in the face with a ladder, necessitating a trip to the emergency room where his broken nose received 15 stitches. The facial injury was worked into the angle, and when Mercury returned wearing a protective covering on his face, the rivalry between the teams intensified with MNM actively seeking to injure one or both of the Hardys, even going so far as to attack and perform a Snapshot on Matt on exposed concrete following a match. MNM lost to The Hardys at the Royal Rumble, and again at the No Way Out pay-per-view in February, which concluded the feud. =Post-breakup= After their feud with the Hardys was over, Nitro and Melina continued to team on Raw, while Mercury wrestled in singles competition on SmackDown!. On March 26, 2007, through WWE's official website, it was announced that Mercury had been released from his contract. Melina and Nitro's association began to fizzle out when Melina became the WWE Women's Champion and began garnering attention as a singles performer. Melina was released from her contract in 2011. During the 2007 supplemental draft, Nitro moved to the ECW brand, was renamed John Morrison and would go on to capture the ECW World Championship. Morrison formed a partnership with The Miz, capturing both the WWE Tag Team Championship and the World Tag Team Championship, as well as becoming a two-time Slammy Award winner. He also gained his third WWE Intercontinental Championship shortly after his alliance with The Miz, before leaving WWE in 2011. Mercury returned to WWE in 2010, first as a member of CM Punk's Straight Edge Society, and later began working as a trainer in Florida Championship Wrestling (later renamed NXT). He most recently appeared on television alongside The Authority and as part of J&J; Security, former WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins's \\"personal security\\". Nitro and Melina had a brief reunion when Melina made an appearance in Lucha Underground at Ultima Lucha, attacking Alberto El Patron during his match with Nitro, now known as Johnny Mundo, allowing Nitro to pick up the win. On September 22, 2017, Nitro, under his John Morrison ring name, and Mercury reunited for the first time in ten years at an All Pro Wrestling event, defeating Reno Scum.

It is about thirty kilometres east of Montreal, and immediately east of the Richelieu River. It is one of the Monteregian Hills. Around the mountains are the towns of Mont-Saint- Hilaire and Saint-Jean-Baptiste. Other nearby towns include Otterburn Park, Beloeil and McMasterville. The area surrounding the mountain is a biosphere reserve, as one of the last remnants of the primeval forests of the Saint- Lawrence valley. Most of the mountain is currently the property of McGill University, as the Gault Nature Reserve, which is considered the third McGill campus. The University has opened the western half of the mountain to visitors (at a fee) for hiking and cross-country skiing, as the Milieu Naturel (natural area). The eastern half, or Milieu de Conservation (preservation area) is not accessible to the general public. Until the late nineteenth century, the lack of information on more remote summits of Quebec, as well as the relatively high prominence (about ) of Mont Saint-Hilaire, led to it being mistaken as the highest summit in Québec. In actuality, Saint-Hilaire's 414 metres falls far short of making it the highest mountain in Quebec. Mont Saint-Hilaire is home to a wide variety of fauna and flora, as well as a number of rare minerals, including some which were discovered on the mountain and some which are unique to the region. These minerals are exploited by a quarry on the north-eastern side of the mountain. In addition, the soil is ideal for the growth of apple trees, and the mountain's apple orchards draws tens of thousands of visitors each year. Geography The western part of the mountain, seen from the North The mountain stands above the sea level, or 400 metres above the surrounding plains.Lambert, Pierre (2007) Le Mont Saint- Hilaire, Éditions du Septentrion, It has several summits, surrounding a central lake, Lac Hertel (Lake Hertel). Most of the well-known summits of the mountain are in the western (open to the public) part. They are the Pain de Sucre (Sugar Loaf), high, the Sunrise, high, the Rocky, high, and the Sommet Dieppe (Dieppe Summit), high as well as Burnt Hill( high). The summits of the eastern half of the mountain, which is closed to the public, are generally little known, to the point that most official maps fail to identify the distinct summits at all. Only a few names are known, such as East Hill and Lake Hill. These summits range from in elevation. =Cliffs= Mont Saint- Hilaire seen from the south. The Dieppe, Rocky and Pain de Sucre summits are visible (in order) to the left The best-known feature of the mountain is the cliffs. Collectively known as the falaise dieppe, or falaise de Dieppe (Dieppe cliffs) the cliffs are part of the Dieppe summit, and nearly high. Some of the best known features of the cliffs include the 60-metre high Tour rouge (Red tower), as well as two slabs, the Dalle noire (Black slab) and Dalle Verte (Green slab), which rise at a 75-degree angle. The cliff's unique ecosystem hosts lichens, as well as cedar trees, some of which may be as much as five hundred years old. It also hosts the mountain's population of peregrine falcons. However, the action of rock climbers has proven destructive to the ecosystem, in addition to being dangerous to the climbers themselves. A white cross on the cliff commemorates the death of a boy scout in 1941. =Lac Hertel= At the centre of the mountain is Lac Hertel, a lake in a glacially- formed depression in the middle of the various summits. It covers an area of 0.3 square kilometre (0.12 square mile), and has a maximum depth of . It is fed by three permanent streams; a fourth flows from the lake toward the Richelieu River. The lake serves as a secondary reservoir of drinking water to the region, and, as such, swimming, fishing and boating are forbidden. The central position of the lake on the mountain has led to claims that Mont Saint-Hilaire is a volcanic caldera. However, the lake is actually the result of glacial erosion, and in no way an ancient volcanic crater. Geology Carletonite crystal from Poudrette Quarry, Mont Saint-Hilaire, its type locality. Catapleiite-Analcime-Aegirine Mont Saint-Hilaire is one of the Monteregian Hills, a group of erosional remnants of intrusive mountains spread across southern Quebec. It is composed of three distinct plutonic intrusions that formed during the Cretaceous Period between 133 and 120 million years ago.McGill University: Mineralogy of Mont Saint-Hilaire Retrieved on 2008-07-07 Like the other Monteregian Hills, Mont Saint-Hilaire forms part of the Great Meteor hotspot track, which was created when the North American Plate slid over the New England hotspot. During this time, melting occurred, creating subsurface magma intrusions. Erosion of the surrounding softer sedimentary rocks revealed the more resistant rocks of Mont Saint-Hilaire. =Mineral wealth= Mont Saint-Hilaire is a famous mineral locality because of its great number of rare and exotic mineral species. Annite (iron rich biotite) from Mont Saint-Hilaire is among the most iron-rich found in nature. In the gabbro, biotite is less iron-rich, has lower manganese content, but is titanium-rich. Phlogopite is found as small metamorphic crystals in marble xenoliths within the syenite. Siderophyllite, a relatively rare mineral, occurs as large crystals in a metasomatised albite-rich albitite dike. In addition to gabbro, the second intrusive suite included nepheline syenite, diorite and monzonite. The third intrusive occupies the eastern side and is mainly peralkaline nepheline syenites and porphyrites. The most mineralogically interesting are the associated agpaitic (alkali rich, low aluminium and silicon) pegmatites, the intrusive breccias, and the hornfels derived from the metasomatised sedimentary wall rocks. There have been over 366 distinct species of minerals collected at Mont Saint-Hilaire, 50 of which have this site as type locality. Ecology As the last remnant in Quebec of the ancient Gulf of St. Lawrence lowland forests, the area has been a provincial biosphere reserve since 1978 and a federal Migratory Bird Sanctuary since 1960. The area hosts 21 at risk and two endangered species of plant under current statutes. History The mountain, particularly the Pain-de- Sucre summit, was well known by the Algonquin First Nations, who used it as a vantage point to survey the valley of the Richelieu River below. Maison des Cultures Amérindiennes (in french) The mountain is located in Abenaki traditional territory and its name, Wigwômadenizibo, which means little house- shaped mountainhttp://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/la%20toponymie%20des%20Abenaquis.pdf?ts=0.14881141134537756https://gault.mcgill.ca/fr/la- reserve/detail/histoire-humaine/. The first European to visit the region was Samuel de Champlain, who explored the Richelieu River in two expeditions in 1603 and 1609. It was during the later expedition that he discovered the mountain. =Development of the region= Settlement around the mountain began in 1694 when a seigneury was granted to Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville. A village slowly grew on the slopes of the mountain, near the streams emptying out of Lake Hertel. The combination of sugar bushes, the orchards alongside the mountain slopes, and the stream flowing from Lake Hertel which facilitated the construction of watermills provided for growth of the village in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In the nineteenth century, the mountain became a tourist destination, particularly after Tomas Edmond Campbell bought the seigneury from the Hertel de Rouville family in 1844. A café, the Campbell Café, was established in 1851, and in 1874, a 150-room hotel, the Iroquois Hotel. Both burned down, the café in 1861 and the hotel in 1895. The tourist value of the mountain dwindled as development of the Eastern Townships made the northern Appalachians more accessible. =The Gault Reserve= Campbell sold the mountain in 1913 to Andrew Hamilton Gault. While he saw to the development of the region, Gault also insisted on protecting the wild nature of Mont Saint-Hilaire, where he planned to build a mansion home for his retirement. Construction of the mansion began in 1957, but Gault lived there a mere three weeks before he died. He bequeathed the property to McGill University, where he had received his education, Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed. Pirie-Gordon, H., London, 1937, p.872: \\"Gault, of Hatch Court\\" which made it into the \\"Gault Reserve\\". The natural value of the mountain led to its being proclaimed a migratory bird sanctuary in 1960. In 1970, the mountain was divided into a preservation area, closed to the public, and an area open to the public, which became the responsibility of the Centre de Conservation de la Nature (Nature Conservation Centre) in 1972. In 1978, the mountain was made the first world biosphere reserve of Canada as a result of it being the last remnants of the primeval forests of the Saint-Lawrence Valley. Although initial documents indicate the biosphere reserve covered large areas surrounding the mountains, it appears that today, the effective definition of the biosphere reserve corresponds to that of the Gault Reserve. Names of Mont Saint-Hilaire In the modern Abenaki language, Mont Saint-Hilaire is known as Wigwômadenizibo, meaning the small house-shaped mountainhttp://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/la%20toponymie%20des%20Abenaquis.pdf?ts=0.14881141134537756. The neighbouring Mount Yamaska is similarly referred to in Abenaki as Wigwômadenek (Wigwam-shaped mountain), without the diminutive suffixhttp://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/pdf/la%20toponymie%20des%20Abenaquis.pdf?ts=0.14881141134537756. The mountain was formerly rendered by Europeans as Wigwomadensis (Wigwam- shaped mountain). When Samuel de Champlain visited the mountain, he named it Mont Fort (which can be interpreted as \\"Fort Mountain\\" or \\"Mount Strong\\"). The establishment of the town and parish of Chambly to the south led to the mountain temporarily becoming Mont Chambly in the later seventeenth century (although the name persisted in English until at least 1830). After 1697, the mountain became known as Mont Rouville, after the newly established seigneury of the Hertel de Rouville family. When the Campbell family replaced the Hertel de Rouville family, the mountain took up the name Mont Beloeil, after the nearby municipality of Beloeil, on the other side of the Richelieu River. However, the name Mont Saint-Hilaire, after the parish of Mont-Saint-Hilaire established at the foot of the mountain, became prevalent by the early twentieth century. Even so, quarrels between inhabitants of Beloeil and Mont- Saint-Hilaire, both near the mountain, as to which the mountain should be named after lasted well into the twentieth century, with the town newspapers of Beloeil attempting to resurrect the debate as late as 1986. Mont Saint- Hilaire in culture Mont Saint-Hilaire, owing to its stark form, has always played a significant part in the culture of the nearby region. It is an important regional icon, its silhouette appearing in the symbols of many towns and cities of the region, such as Beloeil, McMasterville, Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Otterburn Park. =In art= Several artists have painted Mont Saint- Hilaire over the years. The first was the English painter John Bainbrigge, who made three separate watercolour paintings of the mountains around 1838, while garrisoned in the region. A few decades later, the mountain also appeared in a painting by Cornelius Krieghoff. However, the famous artists most closely linked with the mountains are the three who were born or lived in Mont-Saint- Hilaire itself over the course of the late nineteenth and twentieth century: Ozias Leduc, born in 1864 in Mont-Saint-Hilaire, his student Paul-Émile Borduas, also born in Mont-Saint-Hilaire in 1905, and finally, Jordi Bonet, who, after emigrating to Québec, settled down at Mont-Saint-Hilaire in 1969. Leduc especially is known for his numerous representations of the mountain in several paintings such as L'Heure Mauve and Neige Dorée, but the mountain also inspired the work of Borduas, such as his Le Trou des Fées and Synthèse d'un paysage de Mont-Saint-Hilaire, and Bonnet, who included the silhouette of the mountain in several of his works. =In religion= Some evidence suggests that Mont Saint-Hilaire, particularly the Pain de Sucre summit, was a sacred site of the Algonquin natives, who conducted rituals there. Despite a slow establishment in the region (the first two parishes at the foot of the mountain, Saint-Jean-Baptiste and Saint-Hilaire, were only established in 1796 and 1798), the Catholic Church soon established itself on the mountain. In 1841, a great wooden cross was built atop the mountain, more than high and across, with a chapel at its base. The cross was hollow, allowing visitors to climb to the top. A winding trail was established leading up to the mountain, with stations of the cross along the way. The cross was destroyed in a storm in 1846. It was replaced in 1871 by a stone chapel, which burned in 1876. =In legends= Oral tradition in the area surrounding Mont Saint-Hilaire has recorded several legends concerning the mountains. Local figures such as the painter Ozias Leduc and local historians Armand Cardinal and Pierre Lambert have set down in writing several of those legends; even so much of the oral tradition is now lost. Legends of the mountain generally centre on the figures of either the mountain's three fairies, who are said to have lived in a cave in the cliff-face for several centuries before abandoning the mountain and their immortality to marry their mortal lovers, or the devil, and the existence of two passage to hell, including the location known as les Portes de fer (the Iron gates) (two great stone slabs found next to one another on the slopes of the mountain). Lac Hertel is also at the centre of several legends. According to different legends, it is either bottomless, connected by underground passages to Lake Champlain, or was formed as a direct result of the devil successfully convincing several of the early settlers to abandon their promise to attend mass at the newly established chapel every Sunday. Another legend, based on the unusual ice patterns found on the northern cliff- face of the mountain, where a vaguely horse-shaped ice formation does not melt until late in the spring, state that the spirit of a local farmer's horse warns farmers against planting their crop so long as the ice formation remains on the mountain. =In esotericism= Since the late twentieth century, the mountain has become a major hub of alleged supernatural activity. The towns surrounding the mountain have shown the highest number of UFO sightings in Quebec. The Ufologist organisation UFO-Québec has claimed Mont Saint-Hilaire to be the central hub of all UFO observations in southern Quebec. On the night of May 22–23, 1981, several hundred people came to the mountain after Richard Glenn claimed to have been warned of UFO visits to the mountain that night. The observations were severely limited by a rainstorm, although some alleged sightings still took place. Glenn also introduced the concept of the hollow earth to the mountain, claiming Mont Saint-Hilaire to be an entrance leading to the domain of the inhabitants of the hollow earth. The abundance of unusual minerals and crystals at Mont Saint-Hilaire, as well as the effect of its mass upon local magnetism, have also been of great interest to followers of the New Age movement and conspiracy theories.

Locals often refer to \\"Old Eddyville\\" for Eddyville and \\"Old Kuttawa\\" for Kuttawa. The \\"Old\\" areas were the portions of the cities that were left above the water after the areas were flooded; these old areas are now lakefront. The present-day cities were created on nearby sites after the lake was impounded. Old foundations and streets, previously flooded, are still visible during winter pool.

Established in 1886 as St. Mary's School in Concord, New Hampshire, the school moved to its current location in 1936, situated just north of the White Mountains of New Hampshire. History The White Mountain School was founded in 1886 as an all-girls Episcopal high school called St. Mary's School in Concord, New Hampshire. In 1935, Dorothy McLane, the school's headmistress, moved the school north into the White Mountains region, to the estate of Ernest Poole in Sugar Hill, New Hampshire; the school was then renamed St. Mary's-in-the-Mountains. One year later in 1936, the school bought the Seven Springs Estate, in Bethlehem, New Hampshire, from Eman and Mary Payne Beck and relocated there for the last time. Over the next 25 years, the Bethlehem campus expanded with the purchase of new dormitories and the construction of new classroom wings. On January 3, 1964, the school's Main Building burned down. The following year, a new Main Building was constructed in its place. Six years later, in 1970, the school began accepting a small number of male day students, and in 1972 the school became co-educational and changed its name to The White Mountain School. Academics The White Mountain School curriculum is structured in a traditional liberal arts model. Each discipline offers a range of courses from introductory-level, Honors, Advanced Placement, to student-designed independent studies. Year-long courses are worth one credit; semester courses are worth ½ credit. To graduate, students must earn 19 academic credits, including a minimum of 4 credits in English, 2 ½ credits in history, 3 credits in mathematics, 3 credits in science, 2 credits in world language, 1 credit in the arts, ½ credit in philosophy and religious studies and ½ credit in sustainability studies. (The White Mountain School was the first high school in the US to add Sustainability Studies as an academic department.) In addition, students must complete two Field Courses per year and a LASR Project. \\"Natural History of the Mojave Desert: Joshua Tree National Park Rock Climbing\\" Field Course The White Mountain School Field Course is a week-long, academic exploration of a specific topic that occurs within an appropriate geographic setting. They occur in October and March for five days in length. Recent courses have included Poverty, Homelessness and Hunger (Portland, Maine), Adirondack Art and Adventure (New York), Island Culture and Ecology (Acadia National Park, Maine), Avalanche Forecasting (Wyoming & Idaho), A Walk in Thoreau's Shoes (Massachusetts), Gender & Politics: Women's Rights in the US (Washington, DC), Desert Ecology of the Southwest (Tucson, Arizona), Community Service Odyssesy (Dominican Republic), Writing for Performance: Exploration of Performing Arts (New Hampshire), Buddhism (The Vermont Zen Center, Shelburne, Vermont), Green Living in the Urban World: Sustainability & Service (Montreal), Carving Up Equations to Carve the Slopes: The Math of Ski and Snowboard Design (Vermont & New Hampshire). \\"LASR\\" in the White Mountain School LASR Project stands for the general categories that students can pursue: Leadership, Arts, Service and Research. Students choose from several approaches to completing the project, including (but not limited to) the following courses: Research Seminar, Art Portfolio, Independent Study, Senior Project, and Field Course Leadership. Faculty and advisors Every student has a faculty advisor who communicates with parents throughout the year and they serve as a primary liaison between student, family, and teacher. 67% of the faculty hold advanced degrees as well as a variety of additional certifications. College matriculation Recent WMS graduates have attended colleges and universities that include American University, Boston University, Colby College, Connecticut College, Davidson College, Drexel University, Duke University, Mount Holyoke College, New York University, Tufts University, the University of Michigan, the University of New Hampshire, and Wesleyan University. Student body The White Mountain School enrolls 123 students from around the country and the world, 49% male and 51% female. 76% of the student population boards and 24% are day students from surrounding towns. Campus Aerial view of The White Mountain School (foreground) with Littleton, NH, in the distance The school's campus is located between the towns of Bethlehem and Littleton, New Hampshire on a hilltop providing views of the White Mountains. The McLane Academic Center houses the classroom wing, multimedia center and learning labs. The school library offers more than 7,000 volumes, an online catalog, several online databases, and an inter-library loan system with Dartmouth College and the University of New Hampshire. The Fred Steele Science Center is equipped with SMART Board interactive technology and state-of-the-art labs which allow for a wide range of independent projects. The new Catherine Houghton Arts Center houses dance, visual arts, and music studios. The school partners with Creative Edge Dance Studio to offer academic courses as well as technique and performance-based classes for students of all dance styles and levels. Students have access to these spaces and the practice studios and recording lab outside of class. The indoor Beverly S. Buder climbing wall is located inside an indoor sports center outfitted with Nautilus equipment, free weights and aerobic equipment. The campus also has two athletic fields, an extensive trail system, and a school farm, including a student-built post and beam shed; a chicken coop with hens; an organic vegetable and fruit garden; and composting bins. The student center is located in McLane. Boarding students live in one of four dorms with their peers, faculty members and faculty families.

He served as Montgomery's staff officer for a period of over two and a half years. He played an important diplomatic role in sustaining relations between the notoriously difficult Montgomery and his peers and superiors. Early life De Guingand was born in Acton (West London), the second of three brothers, and a younger sister. His parents moved to London from Yorkshire. After the Royal Navy rejected him for being colour blind, he joined the British Army. De Guingand was educated at Ampleforth College and graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1918. He joined the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) in December 1919, and was promoted to lieutenant on 17 December 1921.London Gazette, 23 December 1921 He was seconded to the King's African Rifles from 1926 to 1931; during this time he was promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 10 June 1929London Gazette, 11 June 1929 and to the permanent rank on 8 March 1930.London Gazette, 4 April 1930 De Guingand was the Officer Commanding Troops, Nyasaland, 1930–1931 before returning to his regiment in October 1931. He was appointed regimental adjutant in July 1932 and then served as Military Assistant to the Secretary of State for War, 1933–1936, and again 1939-1940. He was promoted major in August 1938. Despite failing the entrance exams to attend Staff College, he was nominated for the 1935-36 course at Camberley through the intervention of Bernard Montgomery, with whom he had served in the 1920s and formed a friendship.Mead (2007), p. 112 Second World War de Guingand outside Montgomery's caravan, Tripoli. At the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, de Guingand became Military Assistant to the Secretary of State for War in which role he had exposure to the most senior officers in the army and developed skills in diplomacy. In January 1940 he was posted as an instructor to the new staff college at Haifa in the rank of lieutenant- colonel.Mead (2007), p. 113 After a short period as Commandant of the newly formed School of Combined Operations, he was posted in December 1940, on the recommendation of the Staff College's Commandant Eric Dorman-Smith, to the Joint Planning Staff of GHQ Middle East in Cairo where he also took on the role of secretary to the Commanders-in-Chief Committee. He was involved in controversy when it was discovered he had on his own initiative been planning from an early date the evacuation of the expeditionary force to Greece. However, with the support of the naval and air C-in-Cs he was allowed to continue with his plans. In February 1942 Dorman-Smith, by this time Deputy Chief of the General Staff in Cairo, recommended de Guingand for the vacant post of Director of Military Intelligence, Middle East. In this role he proved to be very successful and after the First Battle of El Alamein he was appointed as Eighth Army's Brigadier General Staff (Operations). When Montgomery was appointed to command Eighth Army in August 1942 he summoned de Guingand to meet him. He later wrote: He was to serve as Montgomery's chief of staff, responsible for the running of Montgomery's armies, on their journey from Egypt to the Rhine. He was promoted acting major-general after the surrender of the Axis forces in North Africa in May 1943.Mead (2007), p. 114 Montgomery once wrote to Chief of the Imperial General Staff Alan Brooke saying about de Guingand 'I do not know what I should do without him as he is quite 1st class'. De Guingand was to prove indispensable to Montgomery, not only in battle, but also in relations with the Americans. De Guingand seems to have been blessed with considerable diplomatic skills, which proved useful when serving with Montgomery. He formed a close relationship with Walter Bedell Smith, Chief of Staff to Supreme Allied Commander Dwight Eisenhower and was able to smooth over many difficulties arising from Montgomery's problematic relationships with many of his peers and superiors.Mead (2007), p. 115 He was awarded the Legion of Merit (Commander) by the United States in April 1945 and the US Distinguished Service Medal in 1948. He was awarded the DSO after the victory at El Alamein and having been given the OBE earlier was promoted to CBE after the capture of Tripoli at the end of the Western Desert Campaign. Following the campaign in Sicily he was appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). He was further promoted in the Order of the British Empire when he was knighted KBE in 1944, an unusual honour for a major- general. At the time he had a substantive rank of major (war substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel) although his permanent rank was advanced to full colonel in March 1945. De Guingand had been under great strain, and during the first half of 1944 he was away on sick leave on several occasions. After the end of hostilities in Europe he spent time recuperating but was still not recovered when, he was appointed as Director of Military Intelligence in September 1945. He was promoted to substantive major-general in September 1946. Montgomery had become aware that he was to succeed Alan Brooke as Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1946 and told de Guingand he wanted him as his Vice Chief. However, still recovering from illness, de Guingand failed to impress Brooke as DMI and as a result the Vice Chief job went to Frank Simpson.Mead (2007), p. 116 Post war In February 1947 de Guingand retired from the army and arrived in Southern Rhodesia to pursue a career in business, achieving considerable success. In addition he wrote the following books: Operation Victory, Generals at War, African Assignment and From Brass Hat to Bowler Hat. His memoirs did not always cast Montgomery in a favourable light and as a result their friendship suffered. De Guingand was the head of the South Africa Foundation, an organization founded in 1959 by Harry Oppenheimer whose chief goal was to \\"block economic sanctions\\" led by the Anti-Apartheid Movement. In 1973 he was interviewed on the British TV documentary series The World at War. Death De Guingand died on 29 June 1979 in Cannes, Alpes- Maritimes, France, at the age of 79.

Statue of John H. Stevens by Johannes Gelert in Minnehaha Park John Harrington Stevens (June 13, 1820 – May 28, 1900) was the first authorized resident on the west bank of the Mississippi River in what would become Minneapolis, Minnesota. He was granted permission to occupy the site, then part of the Fort Snelling military reservation, in exchange for providing ferry service to St. Anthony across the river. The Stevens House was moved several times, finally to Minnehaha Park in south Minneapolis in 1896. The house is now a museum, with tours available on summer weekends. The home was considered to be a civic and social hub of the city, and was used to organize both Hennepin County and the city of Minneapolis. Stevens was born in Brompton Falls, Quebec, Canada. He attained the rank of colonel in the U.S. Army, and was involved in the Mexican–American War {John Stevens did not have official rank of Colonel in the U.S. Army; this was an unofficial title commonly used}. He served in the Minnesota House of Representatives in 1857–1858 and the Minnesota Senate in 1859–1860. He returned to the house once later in 1876. Minneapolis and St. Anthony merged in 1872, so there are others who can claim to be earlier Minneapolis residents. The oldest existing house from that earlier settlement was built by Ard Godfrey in 1848, two years before Stevens' home; that house is now at the small Chute Square park in the city.

For example, if a computer program accepts free text input from the user, an ad hoc algorithm will mishandle many combinations of legal and illegal input strings. Input kludges are usually difficult for a programmer to detect in a unit test, but very easy for the end user to find. The evidence exists that the end user can easily crash software that fails to correctly handle user input. Indeed, the buffer overflow security hole is an example of the problems caused. To remedy input kludges, one may use input validation algorithms to handle user input. A monkey test can be used to detect an input kludge problem. A common first test to discover this problem is to roll one's hand across the computer keyboard or to 'mash' the keyboard to produce a large junk input, but such an action often lacks reproducibility. Greater systematicity and reproducibility may be obtained by using fuzz testing software.

The sub-field is also defined as, \\"the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment\\". The focus of its research concerns \\"how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments, and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems\\". Ecological anthropology developed from the approach of cultural ecology, and it provided a conceptual framework more suitable for scientific inquiry than the cultural ecology approach. Research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to environmental problems. Ecological anthropologist, Conrad Kottak published arguing there is an original older 'functionalist', apolitical style ecological anthropology and, as of the time of writing in 1999, a 'new ecological anthropology' was emerging and being recommended consisting of a more complex intersecting global, national, regional and local systems style or approach.  History of the domain and leading researchers  In the 1960s, ecological anthropology first appeared as a response to cultural ecology, a sub-field of anthropology led by Julian Steward. Steward focused on studying different modes of subsistence as methods of energy transfer and then analyzed how they determine other aspects of culture. Culture became the unit of analysis. The first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological populations should be the unit of analysis, and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment. It was characterised by systems theory, functionalism and negative feedback analysis. Benjamin S. Orlove has noted that the development of ecological anthropology has occurred in stages. \\"Each stage is a reaction to the previous one rather than merely an addition to it\\". The first stage concerns the work of Julian Steward and Leslie White, the second stage is titled 'neofunctionalism' and/or 'neoevolutionism', and the third stage is termed 'processual ecological anthropology'. During the first stage, two different models were developed by both White and Steward. \\"The distinction is not as rigid as some critics have made it out to be, White's models of cultural evolution were unilinear and monocausal, whereas Steward admitted a number of different lines of cultural development and a number of different causal factors. During the second stage, it was noted that the later group agreed with Steward and White, while the other disagreed. 'Neoevolutionists' borrowed from the work of Charles Darwin. The general approach suggested that \\"evolution is progressive and leads towards new and better forms in succeeding periods\\". 'Neofunctionalists' \\"see the social organization and culture of specific populations as functional adaptations which permit the populations to exploit their environments successfully without exceeding their carrying capacity\\". 'Processual ecological anthropology' is noted to be new. Studies based on this approach \\"seek to overcome the split in the second stage of ecological anthropology between excessively short and long time scales\\". The approach more specifically, examines \\"shifts and changes in individual and group activities, and they focus on the mechanism by which behavior and external constraints influence each other\\". One of the leading practitioners within this sub-field of anthropology was Roy Rappaport. He delivered many outstanding works on the relationship between culture and the natural environment in which it grows, especially concerning the role of ritual in the processual relationship between the two. He conducted the majority, if not all, of his fieldwork amongst a group known as the Maring, who inhabit an area in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. Patricia K. Townsend's work highlights the difference between ecological anthropology and environmental anthropology. In her view, some anthropologists use both terms in an interchangeable fashion. She states that, \\"Ecological anthropology will refer to one particular type of research in environmental anthropology – field studies that describe a single ecosystem including a human population\\". Studies conducted under this sub-field \\"frequently deal with a small population of only a few hundred people such as a village or neighbourhood\\". Globalization effects on the discipline Studies under the discipline are concerned with the ethnoecologies of indigenous populations. Due to various factors associated with globalization, indigenous ethnoecologies are facing increasing challenges such as, \\"migration, media, and commerce spread people, institutions, information, and technology\\". \\"In the face of national and international incentives to exploit and degrade, ethnological systems that once preserved local and regional environments increasingly are ineffective or irrelevant\\". Threats also exist of \\"commercial logging, industrial pollution, and the imposition of external management systems\\" on their local ecosystems. These threats to indigenous ways of life are a familiar occurrence in the field of anthropology. Conrad Phillip Kottak states that, \\"Today's ecological anthropology , aka environmental anthropology, attempts not only to understand but also to find solutions to environmental problems\\". The discipline's one of the approaches for finding such solutions is contemplating which aspects of human nature lead to environmental degradations. Such features of human nature can include a desire for technological innovations, aspiration for higher social status, and preoccupied or biased inclination to social justice. Another approach to deal with contemporary climate issue is applying a norm of traditional ecological knowledge. Long-term ecological knowledge of an indigenous group can provide valuable insight into adaptation strategies, community-based monitoring, and dynamics between culturally important species and human.  Criticisms  From the beginning various scholars criticised the discipline, saying it inherently was too focused on static equilibrium which ignored change, that it used circular reasoning, and that it oversimplified systems. One of the current criticisms is that, in its original form, ecological anthropology relies upon cultural relativism as the norm. However, in today's world, there are few cultures that are isolated enough to live in a true culturally relative state. Instead, cultures are being influenced and changed by media, governments, NGOs, businesses, etc. In response, the discipline has seen a shift towards applied ecological anthropology, political ecology and environmental anthropology.

The term was coined in 1967 by E. J. Corey. He noted in 1988 that the \\"word synthon has now come to be used to mean synthetic building block rather than retrosynthetic fragmentation structures\\". It was noted in 1998 that the phrase did not feature very prominently in Corey's 1981 book The Logic of Chemical Synthesis, as it was not included in the index. Because synthons are charged, when placed into a synthesis a neutral form is found commercially instead of forming and using the potentially very unstable charged synthons. Example :Retrosynthetic analysis of phenylacetic acid In planning the synthesis of phenylacetic acid, two synthons are identified: a nucleophilic \\"COOH−\\" group, and an electrophilic \\"PhCH2+\\" group. Of course, both synthons do not exist per se; synthetic equivalents corresponding to the synthons are reacted to produce the desired reactant. In this case, the cyanide anion is the synthetic equivalent for the COOH− synthon, while benzyl bromide is the synthetic equivalent for the benzyl synthon. The synthesis of phenylacetic acid determined by retrosynthetic analysis is thus: : PhCH2Br + NaCN → PhCH2CN + NaBr : PhCH2CN + 2 H2O → PhCH2COOH + NH3 :600 px * C2 synthons - acetylene, acetaldehyde * -C2H4OH synthon - ethylene oxide * carbocation synthons - alkyl halides * carbanion synthons - Grignard reagents, organolithiums, substituted acetylides Alternative use in synthetic oligonucleotides This term is also used in the field of gene synthesis—for example \\"40-base synthetic oligonucleotides are built into 500- to 800-bp synthons\\". Carbanionic synthons Comparison between retrosynthetic analysis and the chemical synthesis for an ester alkylation In 1967, E. J. Corey introduced the concept of a synthon in retrosynthetic analysis. Planning the steps of a complex molecule synthesis requires recognizing key synthons and identifying how they can be assembled into a desired product. In many retrosynthetic bond disconnections, the bond is broken heterolytically instead of homolytically, generating a carbocationtic and a carbanionic synthon. Most polar-mechanism reactions, whether they are nucleophilic displacements, 1,2-carbonyl additions, Michael reactions, or other processes, involve the fusion of a nucleophilic fragment and an electrophilic fragment. There are a wide variety of carbanionic synthons available to the organic chemist for the construction of complex molecules. These include enolates, organometallics, acetylides, malonates, and carbanions generated in situ after addition to olefins. An example of a carbanionic synthon for an ester enolate is shown in fig. 1. A carbon-carbon bond alpha to a carbonyl can usually be disconnected to an enolate equivalent and a carbon electrophile. In this case, the enolate is generated by direct deprotonation of the substrate with lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) base. The electrophile is methyl iodide. Since synthons are idealized structures, it is often difficult to find equivalent chemical compounds in the real world. Many carbanion synthons, as drawn, present stability issues that render the molecule’s existence in reality impossible. For example, an acyl anions are not stable species, but the acyl anion synthon can be used to represent reagents such as lithiated dithianes, which are nucleophilic and often used in umpolung chemistry. Carbocationic synthons Fig. 1: Strategic disconnection en route to the hops ether Many retrosynthetic disconnections important for organic synthesis planning use carbocationic synthons. Carbon-carbon bonds, for example, exist ubiquitously in organic molecules, and are usually disconnected during a retrosynthetic analysis to yield carbocationic and carbanionic synthons. Carbon-heteroatom bonds, such as those found in alkyl halides, alcohols, and amides, can also be traced backwards retrosynthetically to polar C-X bond disconnections yielding a carbocation on carbon. Oxonium and acylium ions are carbocationic synthons for carbonyl compounds such as ketones, aldehydes and carboxylic acid derivatives. An oxonium-type synthon was used in a disconnection en route to the hops ether, a key component of beer (see fig.1). In the forward direction, the researchers used an intramolecular aldol reaction catalyzed by titanium tetrachloride to form the tetrahydrofuran ring of hops ether. Another common disconnection that features carbocationic synthons is the Pictet-Spengler reaction. The mechanism of the reaction involves C-C pi-bond attack onto an iminium ion, usually formed in situ from the condensation of an amine and an aldehyde. The Pictet-Spengler reaction has been used extensively for the synthesis of numerous indole and isoquinoline alkaloids. :Fig 2: The Pictet-Spengler disconnection. Carbanion alkylation is a common strategy used to create carbon-carbon bonds. The alkylating agent is usually an alkyl halide or an equivalent compound with a good leaving group on carbon. Allyl halides are particularly attractive for Sn2-type reactions due to the increased reactivity added by the allyl system. Celestolide (4-acetyl-6-t-butyl-1,1-dimethylindane, a component of musk perfume) can be synthesized using a benzyl anion alkylation with 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene as an intermediate step. The synthesis is fairly straightforward, and has been adapted for teaching purposes in an undergraduate laboratory.

A skilled politician, he caused multiple changes of political alliance throughout his reign, switching among the Southerner, Westerner, Soron, and Noron political factions.  Biography  King Sukjong was born on October 7, 1661 to King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong at Gyeonghui Palace. His given name was Yi Sun. He became the Crown Prince Myeongbo in 1667 at age 6, and in 1674, at age 13, he became the 19th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. King Sukjong was a brilliant politician, but his reign was marked by some of the most intense factional fights in the Joseon dynasty. Sukjong frequently replaced faction in power with another one to strengthen the royal authority. With each change of government, which was called hwanguk (), literally turn of the state, the losing faction was completely driven out of politics with executions and exiles. Nevertheless, the chaotic changes of government did not affect the general populace significantly, and his reign is considered one of more prosperous times. =Factional Fightings= In the early years of Sukjong's reign, the Southern faction and Western faction clashed over the Royal Funeral Dispute, a seemingly minor issue regarding the mourning period for Queen Insun. The Southern faction claimed that the mourning period should last one year while the Western faction argued for a nine-month mourning period. A one-year mourning period meant that Hyojong of Joseon was considered the eldest son while 9-month period would suggest that Hyojong was considered not the eldest son, following the rules that governed the yangban class. In other words, the Western faction viewed the royal family as the first of the yangban class rather than a separate class for which different rules applied. The two factions were also in conflict over the issue of fighting the Qing Dynasty, which was considered barbaric country (as opposed to Ming Dynasty) that threatened Joseon's national security. The Southern faction, led by Heo Jeok and Yun Hyu, supported war against Qing while Western factions wanted to focus first on improving domestic conditions. Sukjong at first sided with the Southern faction, but in 1680, Heo Jeok was accused of treason by Western faction, which led to the execution of Heo Jeok and Yun Hyu and purging of the Southern faction. This incident is called Gyeongsin hwanguk (경신환국). Now in power, the Western faction split into the Noron (Old Learning) faction, led by Song Siyeol, and the Soron (New Learning) faction, led by Yun Jeung. After nine years in power, the Noron collapsed when Sukjong deposed Queen Inhyeon, who was supported by the Western faction, and named Consort Hui of Jang clan (also called Consort Jang or Jang Hui-bin) as the new queen. She is widely thought to be one of the most beautiful women in Joseon Dynasty, and her beauty was mentioned in the Annals. The Western faction angered Sukjong when it opposed the naming of Consort Jang's son as crown prince. The Southern faction, who supported Consort Jang and her son, regained power and drove out Western faction, executing Song Siyeol in revenge. This is called Gisa hwanguk (기사환국). Five years later in 1694, the Southern faction was planning another purge of the Western faction, accusing them of conspiracy to reinstate the deposed Queen Inhyeon, when Sukjong began to regret deposing Queen Inhyeon and favor Consort Suk of Choe clan (Consort Choe), an ally of Queen Inhyeon and the Noron faction. Angry with the Southern faction's attempt to purge Westerners, Sukjong abruptly turned around to purge Southerners and brought the Western faction back in power. The Southern faction would never recover from this blow, also called Gapsul hwanguk (갑술환국). Sukjong demoted \\"Queen Jang\\" to Consort \\"Jang Hui-bin\\" and reinstated \\"Queen Inhyeon\\". Consort Jang was eventually executed (with poison) for cursing Queen Inhyeon to her death. The Soron faction supported Crown Prince Hwiso (Yi-Yun), Consort Jang's son, while the Noron faction supported Consort Choe's son, Prince Yeonying (Yi- Geum), later to become Yeongjo of Joseon. Late \\"Queen Inhyeon\\" and newly installed \\"Queen Inwon\\" were childless. In 1718, Sukjong allowed the crown prince, soon to be Gyeongjong of Joseon, to rule the country as regent. Sukjong died in 1720 supposedly after telling Yi Yi-myoung to name Yeoning- geum as Gyeongjong's heir, but in absence of a historiographer or recorder. This will would lead to yet another purge which led to the execution of four Noron leaders in 1721, followed by another purge with the executions of eight Noron people in 1722. Sukjong made tax system reform (大同法), promoted the use of coinage (Korean mun) and allowed the middle class and children of concubines to advance to higher governmental positions in provinces. In 1712, Sukjong's government worked with the Qing Dynasty in China to define the national borders between the two countries at the Yalu and Tumen Rivers. The Japanese government recognized Ulleung Island as Joseon's territory in 1696 (Korean Government insists that Liancourt Rocks was also recognized.Q&A; on Dokdo(Q05) , Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Republic of Korea But Japanese Government insists that Liancourt Rocks was not recognized as Joseon's territoryHistorically, Takeshima belongs to Japan , Shimane Prefectural Government). Sukjong's reign also saw agricultural development of far provinces and increased cultural activities including publications. He died after reigning for 46 years in 1720 at age 60. He was buried in Myeongreung (명릉) in Gyeonggi province, Goyang City inside Western Five Royal Graves (西五陵 서오릉 seooreung).

It is made at the western end of the Loire Valley, near the city of Nantes in the Pays de la Loire region. It is made from the Melon de Bourgogne grape, often referred to simply as melon. While most appellation d'origine contrôlée wines are named after their growing region, or in Alsace after their variety, the name Muscadet refers to an alleged characteristic of the wine produced by the melon grape variety: vin qui a un goût musqué (wine with a musk-like taste). However, according to wine expert Tom Stevenson, Muscadet wines do not have much, if any, muskiness or Muscat-like flavors or aromas. The sole variety used to produce Muscadet, Melon de Bourgogne, was initially planted in the region sometime in or before the 17th century. It became dominant after a hard freeze in 1709 killed most of the region's vines. Dutch traders, who were major actors in the French wine trade, encouraged the planting of this variety; they distilled much of the wine produced into eau de vie for sale in Northern Europe. The generic Muscadet appellation, officially established in 1937, contains three regional sub-appellations: # Muscadet- Sèvre et Maine, officially established in 1936, covering 20,305 acres (8,217 hectares) with 21 villages in the Loire-Atlantique department and 2 in the Maine-et-Loire department. This appellation produces 80% of all Muscadets. # Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire, officially established in 1936, covering 467 acres (189 hectares) with 24 villages spread across the Loire-Atlantique and Maine-et-Loire departments. # Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu, officially established in 1994, benefits from the Grandlieu lake's microclimate. This sub appellation covers 717 hectares with 17 villages in the Loire-Atlantique department and 2 villages in the Vendée department. History Evidence suggest that Louis XIV ordered the plantings of Melon de Bourgogne in the Muscadet region following the devastating frost of 1709 that wiped out many vineyards.The wine-growing tradition in the region where Muscadet is produced dates from an edict of the Roman emperor Probus who had the first vineyards planted by soldiers.Culinaire Saisonnier, hiver 2006/07http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/loirenantais.shtml The exact origins of Muscadet wine, and its association with the Melon de Bourgogne grape, is not clear. One estate near Nantes, Château de la Cassemichère, claims that the first Melon de Bourgogne vines used to make Muscadet were transported from Burgundy and planted in their vineyards in 1740. However, most ampelographers believe that the Melon de Bourgogne grape was introduced to the Pays Nantais region in the 17th century by Dutch trader looking for a sufficient source of neutral, white wines that could be distilled into brandewijn. Following the deep freeze of 1709, most of the red grape varieties were severely damaged and replaced by the hardier Melon de Bourgogne.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pg 463 Oxford University Press 2006 The French ampelographer Pierre Galet found evidence that following that deep freeze, King Louis XIV ordered the replanting himself with a grape called Muscadent blanc that was most likely the Melon de Bourgogne. By the 20th century, Muscadet began to fall out of favor in the global wine market and earned a reputation for being homogenous and simple. The late 20th century saw a revival in the Muscadet region as ambitious wine producers experimented with new winemaking techniques aimed at bringing out more flavor and complexity in the wine. The 1980s saw a rise in use of oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring while the 1990s introduced the widespread use of extended skin-contact (maceration) prior to fermentation. By the 20th century, the use of these techniques created a wide range of styles and quality of Muscadet wine. Climate and geography The proximity of Nantes and the Muscadet growing region to the Atlantic coast brings a strong maritime influence to the region The Muscadet growing region lies at the far western reaches of the Loire Valley and is dominated by maritime influences of the nearby Atlantic Ocean. The ocean's influence makes the climate of the Muscadet region cooler than the rest of the Loire Valley with more precipitation.E. McCarthy & M. Ewing-Mulligan \\"French Wine for Dummies\\" pg 210-211 Wiley Publishing 2001 Wine expert Tom Stevenson notes that the city of Nantes serves as a shield, protecting the region from northwesterly winds. However the closest vineyards to the city in the village of Vertou are located over 9.5 km from the city center and at higher elevation.http://www96.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+from+nantes+to+vertouhttp://www.geonames.org/2969612/vertou.html Winters have the potential to be harsh with deep freezes common and threatening all the way into early spring. Vineyards in the Muscadet region are scattered across a wide range of terroirs ranging from gentle slopes near the rivers to rolling hills to flat fertile land near the mouth of the Loire river. The most ideally situated vineyards are in the rolling hills Muscadet- Sèvre et Maine sub-appellation located south and east of Nantes. The soil in this area is rich in magnesium and potassium, made up of clay, gravel and sand above subsoils of gneiss, schist, granite and volcanic rock. Throughout the Muscadet region the soils drain well, which is a necessity in a region as damp as the Pays Nantais. In the broader, generic Muscadet AOC the soil is predominantly silt and sand while the soils of the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire has high concentration of schist and the Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu sub-appellation has a mixture of granite and schist based soils. Appellations There are four main appellations of the Muscadet region. At the lowest level is the umbrella AOC Muscadet which covers the entire 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) region. Wine expert Jancis Robinson notes that wines carrying this basic designation are normally the most simple examples of Muscadet. Since the late 1990s, this level has been excluded from using sur lie aging by AOC regulations. Next come the three sub-appellations representing different micro-climates of the region: Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine; Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire, which includes the northernmost expanse of the area; and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu, which is located in the southwestern area around the eponymous lake. As the most northern sub-appellation, the quality of wines from the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire can vary greatly depending on the vintage. In cooler years the grapes struggle to ripen and tend not to have the fruit to balance the acidity. In warmer years, this area tends to produce the most balanced wines. Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu is the most recent AOC promotion, gaining its status in 1996. Prior to gaining its own sub-appellation, this region was responsible for nearly three-quarters of the wine labeled as basic Muscadet AOC. Well made examples from Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are characterized by floral bouquet and minerality. The Muscadet- Sèvre et Maine sub-appellation is the most productive and notable region of Muscadet, producing more than three-quarters of the region's entire production. (In contrast, the Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire AOC only produces around 20% of the amount of wine of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine) In fact, more AOC Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is produced on a yearly basis than in any other single AOC in the entire Loire Valley. The appellation is located east and south around the city of Nantes and is named after the rivers Sèvre and Maine that flow through it. Vineyard soil composition varies throughout the region and can range from the granite and schist hillsides around the village of Saint- Fiacre-sur-Maine to the predominantly clay based soils of Vallet. The most ideally situated vineyards are located around the villages of La Chapelle- Heulin, St-Fiacre, Vallet and VertouH. Johnson & J. Robinson The World Atlas of Wine pg 116 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 Around 45% of the wine made Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine is aged sur lie. The wines made in this style tend to be slightly fuller body and can have some of the texture and mouthfeel of a white Bourgogne AOC. Well made examples will have a balance of fruit, acidity and texture. Viticulture flowering. The most common viticultural hazards in the Muscadet region are seasonal frost and mildew near harvest. The Melon de Bourgogne has adapted well to these condition being very frost resistant and capable of ripening early. Harvest usually takes place in mid to late September but in recent years producers have been experimented with harvesting the grapes several days to a couple weeks later. The traditional method is to harvest early in order to maintain acidity that is a key characteristic of Muscadet wine. The trend to pick later, and risk the threat of rains and mildew rot, is to give the grapes more time to develop sugars and riper phenols that can impart more fruit notes and complexity to the wine. However, these grapes that are picked later will usually experience a dramatic drop in acidity. Winemaking The grape variety used to produce Muscadet, Melon de Bourgogne, is a relatively neutral grape. Winemaking techniques have evolved in the region to adapt to the grape's limitation and bring out more flavor and complexity. The most well-known of these techniques is sur lie aging, where the wine stays in contact with the dead yeast cells left over after fermentation (the lees). The technique was discovered, almost accidentally, in the early 20th century. Traditionally Muscadet producers would set aside a barrel of wine for special occasions, such as a family wedding. This \\"honeymoon barrel\\", as it became known, would take on more flavor and texture due to its contact with the lees.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 262-263 Workman Publishing 2001 Through this process, autolysis occurs which contributes to a creamy mouthfeel that may make the wine seem to have a fuller body. The release of enzymes during this process inhibits oxidation which may also improve the aging potential of the wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 54 Oxford University Press 2006 During this process, the wine is usually not racked for several months. While in many wines, the lack of racking could have the undesired consequences of developing off flavors or other wine faults. However, the relative neutrality of the Melon de Bourgogne grape works in the favor of the Muscadet wine and poses minimal risk to developing off flavors. The process of sur lie aging involves the wine staying in constant contact with the dead yeast cells (known as lees) which appear as sediment at the bottom of a wine barrel (example shown). The late 20th century saw a wave of winemaking innovation and the popularization of several winemaking techniques. The mid-1980s saw increased usage of oak barrels for fermentation over stainless steel fermenting tanks. The process of stirring the lees (bâtonnage) also became more commonplace. By stirring the lees, the dead yeast come into greater contact with the wood-based tannins and pigments that are usually extracted into the wine. The lees act as a sort of buffer between the wines and the oak elements, allowing the wine to maintain its color and not become too harsh and tannic.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 399 Oxford University Press 2006 In the late 1990s, more Muscadet producers started extending the amount of time that the must spends in contact with the grape skins prior to fermentation. This extended maceration allowed the wine to leach more phenolic compounds from the skin which can add complexity to the wine. Muscadet wines are usually bottled in the spring or autumn following the vintage though they can be made in the vins de primeur style (like a Beaujolais nouveau) and be released as early as the third Thursday of November. At time of bottling some carbon dioxide may still be present in the wine, giving it a slight effervescence that can come across as a \\"prickly\\" sensation to the tongue. This effervescence is rarely seen to the degree of a semi-sparkling wine such as Lambrusco. Under French AOC regulations, the maximum alcohol content of a Muscadet must be no more than 12% (after chaptalization)-making it the only unfortified French wine to have a maximum alcohol content stipulation. =Sur lie on the wine label= Wine bottle with the words sur lie printed on both the label as well as embossed on the wine bottle itself. Prior to the early 1990s, any producer of Muscadet wine could use the phrase sur lie on their wine labels regardless of the length of time and manner that it actually spent in contact with the lees. In 1994, French authorities designed regulations that limit the use of sur lie to only wines that comply with a set guideline. First, while the sub- appellations of Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine, Muscadet-Coteaux de la Loire and Muscadet-Côtes de Grandlieu are permitted to use the term, any wine labeled with just the generic AOC Muscadet cannot. Second, the wine must spend at least a full winter in contact with the lees and not be bottled until after the third week of March following the harvest. Some wines are kept in contact longer, in order to produce a more full-bodied style, and not bottled till between mid-October to mid-November. Finally the wine must be bottled directly off its lees and not go through any racking or filtration process. Currently there is no regulation on the size or type of vessel that the wine should be kept in sur lie with. There is a movement among some Muscadet producers to limit the practice to just that done in standard-sized oak barrels, but currently any size barrel or even stainless steel fermentation tanks are allowed to age a wine sur lie and label it accordingly. Wine industry Vineyard of Melon de Bourgogne in the Muscadet region. At the turn of the 21st century there were over 2,500 vineyards in the Muscadet region tended mostly as small lots by individual farmers who either commercialize their own wine or sell their grapes to one of the forty plus négociants in the region. These négociants would blend and bottle the wine under their own label. Grapes The only grape variety permitted in any of the AOC Muscadet is the Melon de Bourgogne. The grape was once prevalent in the Burgundy wine region but was eventually prohibited by French authorities. Introduced by Dutch wine traders in the 17th century, the grape came to thrive in the cool, mild climate of the Pays Nantais. Other varieties are grown in the region-such as Folle blanche, Cabernet franc, Gamay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot noir and Chenin blanc, Pinot gris, Groslot, and Négrette-but must be used under different designations such as the Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure (VDQS) wines of Coteaux d'Ancenis, Fiefs Vendéens or Gros Plant du Pays Nantais. Wines Muscadet wines are often light bodied and almost always dry with very little, if any residual sugar. The AOP states that the wine may not have residual sugar above 5 grams per liter for Blanc and above 3 grams of sugar per liter for Blanc \\"Sur Lie.\\" Left over carbon dioxide from the bottling process can leave the wines with a slight \\"prickly\\" sensation. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan describes Muscadets as fresh and crisp, at their peak drinking ability from release up to three of years of age. Muscadet that have been aged sur lie can have very subtle \\"yeasty\\" aromas. The acidity keeps the wines light and refreshing.A. Domine (ed.) Wine, pp. 220, Ullmann Publishing, 2008 Some examples can have a slight \\"saltiness\\" about them. =Food pairing= Muscadet has been described by Jon Bonné as the \\"perfect oyster wine\\" The classic food and wine pairings in the Pays Nantais region is of Muscadet with the local seafood, particularly oysters. Other seafood dishes with which Muscadet pairs well include lobster, shrimp and mullet. San Francisco Chronicle wine editor Jon Bonné called Muscadet \\"the perfect oyster wine\\".O. Wu \\" New, old worlds your oyster when pairing wine\\" San Francisco Chronicle, September 28th, 2007 The moderate alcohol level of Muscadet allows it to complement many types of dishes without overwhelming them. The light, crisp acidity can \\"cut through\\" (meaning it stands out against) rich, creamy dishes which can be a refreshing change of pace for the palate.E. Deitch \\"Why you should pour a Muscadet tonight\\" MSNBC, April 11th 2008 =Cellaring and service= Most Muscadets should be drunk within three years of production. There are, however, some exceptions to this rule. Depending upon the soils upon which they are produced and vinification, some Muscadets can have an aging potential of up to and exceeding ten years. Master Sommelier Geoff Kruth is known for his love of well-aged muscadet.Château LoiselVins de Loire The organisation responsible in France for promoting Loire Valley wines suggests that Muscadet should be served at between 9 and 11 °C (48.2 - 51.8 °F).

At 125th Street, most traffic continues onto the Willis Avenue Bridge over the Harlem River, which continues into the Bronx. South of Houston Street, the roadway continues as Allen Street south to Division Street. Traffic on First Avenue runs northbound (uptown) only. History Like most of Manhattan's major north-south Avenues, First Avenue was proposed as part of the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 for Manhattan, which designated 12 broad north-south Avenues running the length of the island. The southern portions of the Avenue were cut and laid out shortly after the plan was adopted. The northern sections of the Avenue would be graded and cut through at various intervals throughout the 19th century as the northward development of the island demanded. The IRT Second Avenue Line ran above First Avenue from Houston Street to 23rd Street before turning west at 23rd and then north onto Second Avenue. This elevated line was torn down in 1942. First Avenue has carried one-way traffic since June 4, 1951. A protected bike lane was established along the left side of the avenue south of 50th Street in 2011. Description First Avenue passes through a variety of neighborhoods. Starting in the south at Houston Street, First Avenue passes through the East Village, once a predominantly German and Jewish neighborhood, now a gentrified area populated mostly by hipsters and yuppies. First Avenue then runs by two large urban development projects, Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, two middle-income housing developments that sit on what used to be the Gashouse District, an industrial area. These fill the east side of the avenue from 14th to 23rd Streets. The avenue is very wide in this segment, and is separated by a median. The New York Veterans Affairs Medical Center, the Bellevue Hospital, and NYU Medical Center fill the blocks from there to 34th Street. Between 42nd and 47th streets, the avenue runs past United Nations Headquarters. Here a local bypass, United Nations Plaza, splits from the main road, which runs through the First Avenue Tunnel, rejoining the local street at 49th Street. Crossing under the Queensboro Bridge and entering the Upper East Side, First Avenue runs through a number of residential areas. It serves as one of the main shopping streets of the Yorkville neighborhood, historically a working class German and Hungarian neighborhood, today a wealthy enclave of upper-class residents. In this district, First Avenue is also known as \\"Bedpan Alley\\" (a play on \\"Tin Pan Alley\\") because of the large number of hospitals located nearby. Crossing 96th Street, First Avenue runs through Spanish Harlem, a historically Puerto Rican neighborhood. Before Puerto Rican migration in the 1950s, much of this district was populated by Italians and known as \\"Italian Harlem\\". First Avenue in Italian Harlem was the site of a major open-air pushcart market in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There is still a small Italian enclave in the Pleasant Valley district of East Harlem, between 114th and 120th Streets. The northern reaches of First Avenue, north of roughly 110th Street have also seen a significant increase in Mexican residents. First Avenue then connects to the Willis Avenue Bridge, which crosses the Harlem River at 125th Street and connects to Willis Avenue in the Bronx. In popular culture *The opening scene of Ghostbusters II was filmed at the intersection of First Avenue and 77th Street. *In the Seinfeld TV series, Kramer describes the intersection of First Avenue and 1st Street as the \\"nexus of the universe\\".

Listeners have the ability to both segregate different stimuli into different streams, and subsequently decide which streams are most pertinent to them. Thus, it has been proposed that one's sensory memory subconsciously parses all stimuli and identifies discrete pieces of information by classifying them by salience. This effect is what allows most people to \\"tune into\\" a single voice and \\"tune out\\" all others. It may also describe a similar phenomenon that occurs when one may immediately detect words of importance originating from unattended stimuli, for instance hearing one's name among a wide range of auditory input. An inability to segregate stimuli in this way is sometimes referred to as the cocktail party problem or cocktail party deafness. Neurological basis (and binaural processing) Auditory attention in regards to the cocktail party effect primarily occurs in the left hemisphere of the superior temporal gyrus (where the primary auditory cortex is); a fronto-parietal network involving the inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal sulcus, and intraparietal sulcus also accounts for the acts of attention-shifting, speech processing, and attention control. Both the target stream (the more important information being attended to) and competing/interfering streams are processed in the same pathway within the left hemisphere, but fMRI scans show that target streams are treated with more attention than competing streams. Furthermore, we see that activity in the superior temporal gyrus (STG) toward the target stream is decreased/interfered with when competing stimuli streams (that typically hold significant value) arise. The \\"cocktail party effect\\" - the ability to detect significant stimuli in multitalker situations - has also been labeled the \\"cocktail party problem\\" because our ability to selectively attend simultaneously interferes with the effectiveness of attention at a neurological level. The cocktail party effect works best as a binaural effect, which requires hearing with both ears. People with only one functioning ear seem much more distracted by interfering noise than people with two typical ears. The benefit of using two ears may be partially related to the localization of sound sources. The auditory system is able to localize at least two sound sources and assign the correct characteristics to these sources simultaneously. As soon as the auditory system has localized a sound source, it can extract the signals of this sound source out of a mixture of interfering sound sources. However, much of this binaural benefit can be attributed to two other processes, better-ear listening and binaural unmasking. Better-ear listening is the process of exploiting the better of the two signal-to-noise ratios available at the ears. Binaural unmasking is a process that involves a combination of information from the two ears in order to extract signals from noise. Early work In the early 1950s much of the early attention research can be traced to problems faced by air traffic controllers. At that time, controllers received messages from pilots over loudspeakers in the control tower. Hearing the intermixed voices of many pilots over a single loudspeaker made the controller's task very difficult. The effect was first defined and named \\"the cocktail party problem\\" by Colin Cherry in 1953. Cherry conducted attention experiments in which participants listened to two different messages from a single loudspeaker at the same time and tried to separate them; this was later termed a dichotic listening task. His work reveals that the ability to separate sounds from background noise is affected by many variables, such as the sex of the speaker, the direction from which the sound is coming, the pitch, and the rate of speech. Cherry developed the shadowing task in order to further study how people selectively attend to one message amid other voices and noises. In a shadowing task participants wear a special headset that presents a different message to each ear. The participant is asked to repeat aloud the message (called shadowing) that is heard in a specified ear (called a channel). Cherry found that participants were able to detect their name from the unattended channel, the channel they were not shadowing. Later research using Cherry's shadowing task was done by Neville Moray in 1959. He was able to conclude that almost none of the rejected message is able to penetrate the block set up, except subjectively \\"important\\" messages. More recent work Selective attention shows up across all ages. Starting with infancy, babies begin to turn their heads toward a sound that is familiar to them, such as their parents' voices. This shows that infants selectively attend to specific stimuli in their environment. Furthermore, reviews of selective attention indicate that infants favor \\"baby\\" talk over speech with an adult tone. This preference indicates that infants can recognize physical changes in the tone of speech. However, the accuracy in noticing these physical differences, like tone, amid background noise improves over time. Infants may simply ignore stimuli because something like their name, while familiar, holds no higher meaning to them at such a young age. However, research suggests that the more likely scenario is that infants do not understand that the noise being presented to them amidst distracting noise is their own name, and thus do not respond. The ability to filter out unattended stimuli reaches its prime in young adulthood. In reference to the cocktail party phenomenon, older adults have a harder time than younger adults focusing in on one conversation if competing stimuli, like \\"subjectively\\" important messages, make up the background noise. Some examples of messages that catch people's attention include personal names and taboo words. The ability to selectively attend to one's own name has been found in infants as young as 5 months of age and appears to be fully developed by 13 months. Along with multiple experts in the field, Anne Treisman states that people are permanently primed to detect personally significant words, like names, and theorizes that they may require less perceptual information than other words to trigger identification. Another stimulus that reaches some level of semantic processing while in the unattended channel is taboo words. These words often contain sexually explicit material that cause an alert system in people that leads to decreased performance in shadowing tasks. Taboo words do not affect children in selective attention until they develop a strong vocabulary with an understanding of language. Selective attention begins to waver as we get older. Older adults have longer latency periods in discriminating between conversation streams. This is typically attributed to the fact that general cognitive ability begins to decay with old age (as exemplified with memory, visual perception, higher order functioning, etc.). Even more recently, modern neuroscience techniques are being applied to study the cocktail party problem. Some notable examples of researchers doing such work include Edward Chang, Nima Mesgarani, and Charles Schroeder using electrocorticography; Jonathan Simon, Mounya Elhilali, Adrian KC Lee, Shihab Shamma, Barbara Shinn-Cunningham and Jyrki Ahveninen using magnetoencephalography; Jyrki Ahveninen, Edmund Lalor, and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham using electroencephalography; and Jyrki Ahveninen and Lee M. Miller using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Models of attention Not all the information presented to us can be processed. In theory, the selection of what to pay attention to can be random or nonrandom. For example, when driving, drivers are able to focus on the traffic lights rather than on other stimuli present in the scene. In such cases it is mandatory to select which portion of presented stimuli is important. A basic question in psychology is when this selection occurs. This issue has developed into the early versus late selection controversy. The basis for this controversy can be found in the Cherry dichotic listening experiments. Participants were able to notice physical changes, like pitch or change in gender of the speaker, and stimuli, like their own name, in the unattended channel. This brought about the question of whether the meaning, semantics, of the unattended message was processed before selection. In an early selection attention model very little information is processed before selection occurs. In late selection attention models more information, like semantics, is processed before selection occurs. =Broadbent= The earliest work in exploring mechanisms of early selective attention was performed by Donald Broadbent, who proposed a theory that came to be known as the filter model. This model was established using the dichotic listening task. His research showed that most participants were accurate in recalling information that they actively attended to, but were far less accurate in recalling information that they had not attended to. This led Broadbent to the conclusion that there must be a \\"filter\\" mechanism in the brain that could block out information that was not selectively attended to. The filter model was hypothesized to work in the following way: as information enters the brain through sensory organs (in this case, the ears) it is stored in sensory memory, a buffer memory system that hosts an incoming stream of information long enough for us to pay attention to it. Before information is processed further, the filter mechanism allows only attended information to pass through. The selected attention is then passed into working memory, the set of mechanisms that underlies short-term memory and communicates with long-term memory. In this model, auditory information can be selectively attended to on the basis of its physical characteristics, such as location and volume. Others suggest that information can be attended to on the basis of Gestalt features, including continuity and closure. For Broadbent, this explained the mechanism by which people can choose to attend to only one source of information at a time while excluding others. However, Broadbent's model failed to account for the observation that words of semantic importance, for example the individual's own name, can be instantly attended to despite having been in an unattended channel. Shortly after Broadbent's experiments, Oxford undergraduates Gray and Wedderburn repeated his dichotic listening tasks, altered with monosyllabic words that could form meaningful phrases, except that the words were divided across ears. For example, the words, \\"Dear, one, Jane,\\" were sometimes presented in sequence to the right ear, while the words, \\"three, Aunt, six,\\" were presented in a simultaneous, competing sequence to the left ear. Participants were more likely to remember, \\"Dear Aunt Jane,\\" than to remember the numbers; they were also more likely to remember the words in the phrase order than to remember the numbers in the order they were presented. This finding goes against Broadbent's theory of complete filtration because the filter mechanism would not have time to switch between channels. This suggests that meaning may be processed first. =Treisman= In a later addition to this existing theory of selective attention, Anne Treisman developed the attenuation model. In this model, information, when processed through a filter mechanism, is not completely blocked out as Broadbent might suggest. Instead, the information is weakened (attenuated), allowing it to pass through all stages of processing at an unconscious level. Treisman also suggested a threshold mechanism whereby some words, on the basis of semantic importance, may grab one's attention from the unattended stream. One's own name, according to Treisman, has a low threshold value (i.e. it has a high level of meaning) and thus is recognized more easily. The same principle applies to words like fire, directing our attention to situations that may immediately require it. The only way this can happen, Treisman argued, is if information was being processed continuously in the unattended stream. =Deutsch and Deutsch= Diana Deutsch, best known for her work in music perception and auditory illusions, has also made important contributions to models of attention. In order to explain in more detail how words can be attended to on the basis of semantic importance, Deutsch & Deutsch and Norman proposed a model of attention which includes a second selection mechanism based on meaning. In what came to be known as the Deutsch-Norman model, information in the unattended stream is not processed all the way into working memory, as Treisman's model would imply. Instead, information on the unattended stream is passed through a secondary filter after pattern recognition. If the unattended information is recognized and deemed unimportant by the secondary filter, it is prevented from entering working memory. In this way, only immediately important information from the unattended channel can come to awareness. =Kahneman= Daniel Kahneman also proposed a model of attention, but it differs from previous models in that he describes attention not in terms of selection, but in terms of capacity. For Kahneman, attention is a resource to be distributed among various stimuli,Kahneman, D. (1973). Attention and effort. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. a proposition which has received some support. This model describes not when attention is focused, but how it is focused. According to Kahneman, attention is generally determined by arousal; a general state of physiological activity. The Yerkes-Dodson law predicts that arousal will be optimal at moderate levels - performance will be poor when one is over- or under-aroused. Of particular relevance, Narayan et al. discovered a sharp decline in the ability to discriminate between auditory stimuli when background noises were too numerous and complex - this is evidence of the negative effect of overarousal on attention. Thus, arousal determines our available capacity for attention. Then, an allocation policy acts to distribute our available attention among a variety of possible activities. Those deemed most important by the allocation policy will have the most attention given to them. The allocation policy is affected by enduring dispositions (automatic influences on attention) and momentary intentions (a conscious decision to attend to something). Momentary intentions requiring a focused direction of attention rely on substantially more attention resources than enduring dispositions. Additionally, there is an ongoing evaluation of the particular demands of certain activities on attention capacity. That is to say, activities that are particularly taxing on attention resources will lower attention capacity and will influence the allocation policy - in this case, if an activity is too draining on capacity, the allocation policy will likely cease directing resources to it and instead focus on less taxing tasks. Kahneman's model explains the cocktail party phenomenon in that momentary intentions might allow one to expressly focus on a particular auditory stimulus, but that enduring dispositions (which can include new events, and perhaps words of particular semantic importance) can capture our attention. It is important to note that Kahneman's model doesn't necessarily contradict selection models, and thus can be used to supplement them. Visual correlates Some research has demonstrated that the cocktail party effect may not be simply an auditory phenomenon, and that relevant effects can be obtained when testing visual information as well. For example, Shapiro et al. were able to demonstrate an \\"own name effect\\" with visual tasks, where subjects were able to easily recognize their own names when presented as unattended stimuli. They adopted a position in line with late selection models of attention such as the Treisman or Deutsch-Norman models, suggesting that early selection would not account for such a phenomenon. The mechanisms by which this effect might occur were left unexplained.  Effect in animals  Animals that communicate in choruses such as frogs, insect, songbirds and other animals that communicate acoustically can experience the cocktail party effect as multiple signals or calls occur concurrently. Similar to their human counterparts, acoustic mediation allows animals to listen for what they need to within their environments (e.g., mates, threats, etc...). For Bank swallows, cliff swallows, and king penguins, acoustic mediation allows for parent/offspring recognition in noisy environments. Amphibians also demonstrate this effect as evidenced in frogs; female frogs can listen for and differentiate male mating calls, while males can mediate other males' aggression calls. There are two leading theories as to why acoustic signaling evolved among different species. Receiver psychology holds that the development of acoustic signaling can be traced back to the nervous system and the processing strategies the nervous system uses. Specifically, how the physiology of auditory scene analysis affects how a species interprets and gains meaning from sound. Communication Network Theory states that animals can gain information by eavesdropping on other signals between others of their species. This is true especially among songbirds.

In North America, this episode was somehow syndicated onto UPN affiliates a week early by accident. Although none of them broadcast the episode by mistake, the episode was leaked onto the internet more than a week before it was slated to air. The episode was also noted for its drastic and controversial content, being the only episode of the series to air at an alternate time on the Canadian family network YTV.  Plot synopsis  Willow and Tara snuggle in bed together after their reconciliation, discussing the possibility that something is going on between Buffy and Spike. Tara confirms Willow's suspicions, adding that Buffy feels ashamed of her sexual relationship with Spike. Willow is hurt that she was never told, but simply puts it aside when she remembers what Buffy is going through. Willow goes to check on Buffy, but instead encounters Dawn in the hallway. When Tara appears wearing just a sheet, Dawn is thrilled to see they are back together. Buffy meanwhile has decided to take care of the Trio once and for all and breaks into their lair, but finds the place deserted and dangerous traps waiting for her. She escapes, managing to grab a few items before large saw blades tear apart the house. Buffy, Dawn, Willow and Tara gather to go over those items, realizing sadly that the rest of the group won't be helping since they all have other priorities or lack interest. Anya sits with a young scorned woman who wants to wish vengeance on her cheating boyfriend, but Anya is too busy talking about her own relationship problems to notice the young woman's wish. Dawn visits Spike at his crypt, informing him that she knows he had sex with Anya and Buffy. She lectures him about hurting Buffy when he supposedly loves her and leaves him pondering the thought of how he shows his love to her. Meanwhile in a cave, the Trio kill a large Nezzla demon who is guarding the Orbs of Nezzla'khan. Warren and Andrew make Jonathan wrap himself in the dead Nezzla's skin to cross a barrier that can only be passed by one of the demons, and as he fetches the orbs the other two conspire against him. Warren tests the power of the orbs and is pleased when he can easily kill another demon. Xander, aghast that Buffy could have been involved with Spike, storms out of an argument with Buffy. He walks the streets alone, pausing briefly to secretly look in on Anya as she works at the magic shop. He ends up at The Bronze drinking away his sorrow over Anya and Spike, when the nerds enter. Orb-enhanced Warren hits on a former schoolmate's girlfriend, and when the woman's boyfriend steps in Warren fights off the boyfriend and several others with ease. Xander tries to intervene but is tossed aside. Later, at home in bed, Willow reviews some files on her laptop, but is quickly distracted by Tara. Buffy, badly injured from patrolling earlier, runs a bath for herself to soothe her aching back. Spike shows up uninvited and tries to convince her that she loves him and just needs to admit it. She protests as he forces himself on her, his attempt to make her feel love for him again. With her back injured, Buffy barely manages to stop his advance on her. Immediately horrified by his behavior, Spike attempts to apologize, but Buffy knows he only stopped because she made him. When Xander notices Spike's coat on the stairs, then finds Buffy on the floor in the bathroom with a large bruise on her leg, he realizes what happened. His desire to go after Spike is thwarted when Willow and Tara arrive to tell Buffy they found plans indicating the Trio are planning to steal a large amount of money. After Xander warns her of Warren's new strength, Buffy rushes off to stop them. Returning to his crypt, Spike thinks back on his attempted rape. He pours himself a drink, but when memories of the attempted rape haunt him he becomes so upset and furious that he crushes the glass in his hand. Just then Clem comes by, and Spike begins to wonder exactly what he is. He becomes distraught both that he attacked Buffy and that he backed off – something the pre-chip Spike would never have done. He questions whether his feelings for Buffy really are love. He realizes he is not a monster, yet can't be a man. Clem tells him that things change, and Spike suddenly gets an idea, and tells Clem that things do change... if you make them. Warren overturns an armored car loaded up with money from a big weekend at an amusement park. Buffy shows up and fights him, but quickly finds herself outmatched against Warren's strength; Warren taunts Buffy with his supposed mastery. Jonathan jumps on Buffy's back and appears to be fighting her, but he quietly informs her that she needs to smash the orbs in order to defeat Warren. Buffy smashes the orbs on Warren's belt. No longer strong, Warren uses a hidden jet pack to escape freely into the sky. Andrew reveals he too has a jet pack, but when he tries to escape, he only knocks himself out on the overhanging roof above him. As the cops haul Jonathan and Andrew off to jail, the jetpack-less Jonathan realizes that the two were about to betray him. In jail, Andrew insinuates that he was in love with Warren. Meanwhile at the city limits, Spike boards his motorcycle and leaves Sunnydale. He promises that when he returns, things will be different. Willow and Tara get dressed and while hugging, Tara notices Xander and Buffy in the backyard together. Buffy and Xander begin to discuss Buffy's relationship with Spike, and the two make up and reaffirm their friendship. As the two hug, Xander spots Warren entering the backyard with a gun. Warren rants about his recent defeat and declares his intentions of revenge. He pulls out the gun, fires directly at Buffy, then shoots randomly over his shoulder as he runs away. Buffy and Xander topple to the ground as the window to Willow's bedroom is broken and a bullet strikes Tara in the back as she's facing Willow. The blood from her wound splatters on Willow's shirt. Tara stares at the stain and manages to say \\"Your shirt...\\" before she collapses and dies. Xander tries to staunch the bleeding of Buffy's chest wound, while in the house, Willow cries out as she holds Tara's lifeless body and her eyes turn magically dark red with pain and fury.  Writing  The episode continues the emphasis on the consequences of actions. Spike takes the time to explain to Dawn that what he and Anya did was wrong. Also, guns make another appearance on the show. By the end of the filming of Tara's death scene, Gellar and Benson were crying. In the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion that took place between seasons six and seven, Alyson Hannigan revealed that getting the shot of Tara's blood spraying onto Willow's shirt was incredibly difficult. Because they only had two shirts, the wardrobe department kept washing the shirts but did not have time to dry them, so the shirt was wet in most of the takes. Hannigan joked that when they finally got the take she wasn't sure what she was doing acting- wise, she was just concerned with, \\"Was that blood good? OK, good. Let's move on.\\" In the DVD commentary, James Marsters said that filming the scene in which Spike attempts to rape Buffy was one of the hardest he ever had to do. He has since said that he will never do such a scene again. That scene has also generated controversy between fans and the writers, but writer Jane Espenson says that moment was necessary to set up a powerful motivation for Spike's quest to gain a soul. As James Marsters points out, \\"How do you motivate him [to] make a mistake that’s so heart-rending that he’d be willing to do that?\\" Marsters would later say in 2012 that he understood the idea to have come from \\"a female writer, [who] had a situation in her life where she was and her boyfriend were breaking up and she decided if she just made love to him one more time, that they wouldn't break up. She ended up trying to force herself on him and decided to write about that. The thing is, if you flip it and make it a man forcing himself on a woman, I believe it becomes a whole different thing... I'm not really sure it expressed what the author was intending and on that score it was not successful.\\" 411mania Interviews: James Marsters (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel), 10th March 2012 In her essay on sex and violence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Gwyn Symonds calls the scene itself \\"technically and emotionally intricate\\" in that, unlike most depictions of attempted rape, it \\"encourages a complex audience engagement with both... the perpetrator and the victim.\\" The action was \\"very carefully choreographed\\" according to James Marsters, with the camera alternating between close-ups of Buffy and Spike separately to reinforce the audience's shifting empathy with both Buffy and Spike. Writer Rebecca Rand Kirshner agrees that the viewer \\"could feel how [Spike's] very innards were twisted into this perversion of what he wanted,\\" and she found that experiencing the scene from his perspective was additionally disturbing.Rand-Kirshner, Rebecca ( 2003) in Life as the Big Bad: A Season Six Overview in Special Features, Season 6 DVDs Collectors Edition, Disc 6.

Anemone ranunculoides), the yellow anemone, yellow wood anemone, or buttercup anemone, is a species of herbaceous perennial plant that grows in forests across most of Continental Europe, and less frequently in the Mediterranean region. It is occasionally found as a garden escape. Description Growing to tall, the plant is herbaceous, dying back down to its root-like rhizomes by mid summer. The rhizomes spread just below the earth surface and multiply quickly, contributing to its rapid spread in woodland conditions. The flower is about diameter, with from five to eight petal-like segments (actually tepals) of rich yellow colouring. In its native range, it flowers between March and May. Cultivation The plant is widely grown as a garden plant, especially by rock garden and alpine garden enthusiasts. It has been awarded an Award of Garden Merit or AGM, H4 (hardy throughout the British Isles) by the Royal Horticultural Society. The double- flowered form 'Pleniflora' (sometimes listed as 'Flore Pleno') is also a recipient of the award. Anemone ranunculoides 'Frank Waley', a larger-growing, more robust cultivar, is sometimes available, as are the miniature subspecies A. ranunculoides subsp. wockeana and a selection known as A. ranunculoides 'Laciniata', with finely divided leaves. Related species and hybrids Anemonoides × lipsiensis with its parents Wood anemone, Anemonoides nemorosa, is similar to A. ranunculoides but has slightly larger flowers (usually white, but they may be pinkish or lilac, often with a darker tint to the back of the 'petals').

It is open daily and only closes on Christmas Day, hours and admission fees can be found on the Arboretum's website. The Arboretum is located across the street from the Santa Anita Park, the horse racetrack, and the shopping mall Santa Anita Fashion Park, now known as Westfield Santa Anita. History The Arboretum is sited on a remaining portion of the Rancho Santa Anita, one of the Mexican land grants of Southern California. Rancho Santa Anita was unusual in that it was located above a large part of the Raymond Basin aquifer. Three sag ponds and numerous springs were found in the area and the only remaining one is now called Baldwin Lake. Lacy Park in the city of San Marino once was another sag pond and the precise location of the third is not known but may have been on the grounds of the Huntington Library and Botanic Garden. As a consequence of the relative abundance of water, it was important area in prehistory as a year-round source of water, the body of water known as Baldwin Lake and the other sag ponds attracted both waterfowl and other animals as well as Native Americans. Not surprisingly the presence of water and game created a permanent Native American habitation in the area and is believed to have been the location of the Tongva village of Aleupkigna. The exact location of the village is unknown. The close proximity to the nearby San Gabriel Mission may have led to the construction of a small seasonal dwelling at the Arboretum site for shepherds or hunters which ultimately led to the construction of a modest adobe structure. In 1839, the grant to Rancho Santa Anita was awarded to Hugo Reid (1809–1852) and his Tongva wife, Victoria. Reid built an adobe home by the lake in 1839, now a California Historic Landmark. Reid was an educated Scotsman known for a series of letters describing Tongva culture. Otherwise Reid was probably best known for his role in the 1849 California Constitutional Convention. Afflicted with tuberculosis, he died at the age of 43. A series of short term owners of the property, Rancho Santa Anita, followed. Subsequent owners of Rancho Santa Anita were; in sequence, Henry Dalton, Joseph A. Rowe, Albert Dibblee in partnership with William Corbett and a Mr. Barker, Leonard Rose and William Wolfskill, Alfred Chapman with Harris Newmark until finally the property was sold to Elias Jackson Baldwin. With each transition, beginning with the sale to Rose and Wolfskill, a portion of the ranch was sold off. Every owner in some ways typifies the history of southern California during the period. Agricultural innovation is a feature which persisted taking advantage of the climate and the new crops that it made possible as well as a growing body of consumers and new markets opened by transportation innovations. The site's modern history began in 1875 when Elias Jackson \\"Lucky\\" Baldwin purchased Rancho Santa Anita and constructed its buildings and grounds. Baldwin's influence was a strong presence on the site. A certain flamboyance was evident in the creation of a showcase at Santa Anita. Baldwin in some ways anticipated the development of Las Vegas creating Arcadia as a kind of prototype destination resort. The Oakwood Hotel, the Santa Anita racetrack and the creation of Arcadia as an independent city made it possible for Baldwin to become its first Mayor. The first liquor license was issued to his oldest daughter Clara Baldwin. This becomes more significant when one understands that Pasadena, which borders Arcadia, was dry from its founding in 1886. A major motivation for incorporation being the banning of liquor in the city. Although many towns in southern California were dry, commercial viticulture flourished around the San Gabriel Mission since mission days. Baldwin started an award-winning winery to supply the thirsty tourists, sold land to settlers as well as running a private water company and brick works. A partnership with Henry E. Huntington and the Santa Fe Railroad insured that passengers could arrive by rail from Los Angeles and other locations as well as bringing freight, such as building supplies and taking away ranch produce for sale. The arboretum itself began in 1947 with California and Los Angeles jointly purchasing 111 acres (44.9 ha) to create an arboretum around the Baldwin site. By 1949, the first greenhouse had been constructed and the site's plants inventoried. In 1951, the first 1,000 trees were planted, and in 1956 the arboretum was opened to the public. Ongoing construction of gardens and greenhouses took place during the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1975-1976 the Tropical Greenhouse was opened and the Prehistoric and Jungle Garden completed. Construction and renovation of both greenhouses and gardens has continued to this day. In 1994, the original name of the garden was changed from Los Angeles State and County Arboretum to The Arboretum of Los Angeles County.  Management  Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden is governed by Los Angeles Arboretum Foundation and Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation. The Los Angeles Arboretum Foundation is a non-profit organization governed by a board of trustees with a CEO. The current CEO and President of the board of trustees are: * CEO: Richard Schulhof. * President: William Lincoln. The current Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation leaders at the Arboretum are: * Director: John Wicker * Assistant Director: Norma E. Garcia * Regional Operations Manager: Hugo Maldonado The gardens The arboretum's plants are grouped by geography with gardens for South American, Mediterranean, South African, Australian and Asiatic-North American plants. Other displays include the Aquatic Garden, Meadowbrook, Demonstration Home Gardens, Garden for All Seasons, Prehistoric and Jungle Garden, Native Oaks, Herb Garden, and the Palm and Bamboo collection. The gardens also serve as the home for summer concerts featuring the Pasadena POPS, under the direction of Principal POPS Conductor Marvin Hamlisch. In addition, the arboretum is home to a flock of some 200 peafowl, which are descendants of original birds imported by Baldwin from India. The peafowl is a symbol of the city of Arcadia. The first record of peafowl in what is now the United States was the introduction by Frances Sinclair on Kaua’i I., Hawai‘i, in 1860.http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/377/articles/introduction However the first reported introduction into the continental United States occurred in 1879, when Elias J. “Lucky” Baldwin brought 3 pairs to his vast ranch in the San Gabriel Valley of California.http://www.audubon.org/news/peacocks-take-over-florida-town Today, semidomestic or feral populations persist mostly in California and Florida. Peafowl can also be found throughout neighborhoods surrounding the arboretum. Mt Wilson seen from the main lawn near the entrance.

Santa Anita Depot In 1970, the Santa Fe Railway depot was moved to the Arboretum during the construction of the 210 Foothill Freeway. It was built in 1890 at today's Colorado Boulevard and Old Ranch Rd. to serve Lucky Baldwin, and the people of Rancho Santa Anita. The depot opened on the Southern California Railway in 1890 and was sold to Santa Fe on January 17, 1906. Before the depot was built, the site was a Rancho Santa Anita railway siding on the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad opened in 1887.abandonedrails.com, Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad Today, the depot is furnished with railroad memorabilia and is open to visitors. A number of films have been made at the station, including the remake of Christmas in Connecticut, which starred Dyan Cannon, Arnold Schwarzenegger (also directed), and Kris Kristofferson. Haunted history The arboretum is widely reported to be haunted, particularly the Queen Anne Cottage. Some have claimed to see the ghost of Lucky Baldwin or one of his wives. Visitors have claimed hearing moaning coming from the house (where Lucky Baldwin's wife also died of cancer), odd cooking smells, and seeing various strange anomalies walk the gardens at night.National Directory of Ghostly AbodesWeird California  Gallery  Selected garden images of Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden.

There are ten German halligen in the North Frisian Islands on Schleswig-Holstein's Wadden Sea-North Sea coast in the district of Nordfriesland and one hallig at the west coast of Denmark (Danish Wadden Sea Islands). The name is cognate to Old-English halh, meaning \\"slightly raised ground isolated by marsh\\".Patrick Stiles, 'OE halh \\"slightly raised ground isolated by marsh\\"', in: Alexander R. Rumble en A.D. Mills (eds.), Names, Places and People. An onomastic miscellany in memory of John McNeal Dodgson, Stamford 1997, p. 330-344. An etymology from Celtic word hal, meaning \\"salt\\" is less likely. The very existence of the halligen is a result of frequent floods and poor coastal protection. The floods were much more common in the Middle Ages and coastal protection was much poorer. The halligen have areas ranging from 7 to 956 ha, and are often former parts of the mainland, separated therefrom by storm tide erosion. Some are also parts of once much bigger islands sundered by the same forces. Sometimes, owing to sediment deposition, islands have actually grown together to form larger ones. Langeneß (or Langeness) includes a former island by that same name, and two others that were called Nordmarsch and Butwehl. Dwellings and commercial buildings are built upon metre-high, man-made mounds, called Warften in German or Værft in Danish, to guard against storm tides. Some halligen also have overflow dikes. Not very many people live on the halligen. Their livelihoods are mainly based on tourism, coastal protection, and agriculture. This last activity mainly involves raising cattle in the fertile, often flooded, salt meadows. The halligen are to be found in the Schleswig-Holsteinisches Wattenmeer National Park. The commercially developed halligen of Nordstrandischmoor, Gröde, Oland, Langeneß, and Hooge are surrounded by the protected area, but not an integral part of it. The smaller halligen, Habel, Südfall, Süderoog, and Norderoog as well as the Hamburger hallig are parts of the national park. Walks on the tidal flats and informational meetings are offered by tourist boards and the park administration. In the west the German halligen are protected from the open sea by the North Frisian Barrier Island. The island of Mandø in the Danish Wadden Sea Islands is also technically one of the halligen, although it is far away from the other ten, which are quite near each other. Mandø can be reached from the mainland over the mudflats at low tide, when a tidal pathway (ebbevej in Danish, meaning \\"ebb-way\\") is above water.

Early life  He was born on 4 July 1908 in Turin, the capital of the Piedmont region of Italy. He spent his youth there, eventually graduating from the University of Turin with a degree in economics in 1930. Soon thereafter he went to the Sorbonne with a scholarship and was awarded a free trip to the Soviet Union. His knowledge of other languages brought him to Fiat S.p.A.. Although under continual suspicion as an anti-fascist in the early-1930s, in 1935 a successful mission for Fiat in China established his position in Fiat management. During World War II, Peccei joined the anti-fascist movement and the resistance, when he was a member of the \\"Giustizia e Libertà\\". He was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. He escaped to hide until liberation.  Business ventures  After the war, Peccei was engaged in the rebuilding of Fiat. He was concurrently involved in various private and public efforts then underway to rebuild Italy, including the founding of Alitalia. In 1949, he went to Latin America for Fiat, to restart their operations, as Fiat operations in Latin America had been halted during the war. He settled in Argentina, where he was to live for a decade with his family. He realised that it would make sense to start manufacturing locally and set up the Argentine subsidiary, Fiat-Concord, which built cars and tractors. Fiat-Concord rapidly became one of the most successful automotive firms in Latin America. In 1958, with the backing of Fiat, Peccei founded Italconsult (a para-public joint consultancy venture involving major Italian firms such as Fiat, Innocenti, Montecatini), and became its chairman, a position he held until the 1970s, when he became honorary president. Italconsult was an engineering and economic consulting group for developing countries. It operated under Peccei's leadership, on the whole, more as a non-profit consortium. Italconsult was regarded by Peccei as a way of helping tackle the problems of the Third World, which he had come to know first-hand in Latin America. In 1964, Peccei was asked to become president of Olivetti. Olivetti was facing significant difficulties at that time due to the profound changes occurring in the office machine sector. Peccei, with his foresight and his entrepreneurial vision, was able to turn the situation at Olivetti around. But Peccei was not content merely with the substantial achievements of Italconsult, or his responsibilities as president of Olivetti, and threw his energies into other organisations as well, including ADELA, an international consortium of bankers aimed at supporting industrialisation in Latin America. He was asked to give the keynote speech in Spanish at the group's first meeting in 1965, which is where the series of coincidences leading to the creation of the Club of Rome began.  The Club of Rome  Peccei's speech caught the attention of Dean Rusk, then US Secretary of State, who had it translated into English and distributed at various meetings in Washington. A Soviet representative at the annual meeting of the United Nations Advisory Committee on Science and Technology (ACAST), Jermen Gvishiani, Alexei Kosygin's son-in-law and vice- chairman of the State Committee on Science and Technology of the Soviet Union, read the speech and was so taken by it that he decided he should invite the author to come for private discussions, outside Moscow. Gvishiani therefore asked an American colleague on ACAST, Carroll Wilson, about Peccei. Wilson did not know Peccei, but he and Gvishiani both knew Alexander King, by then Director General for Scientific Affairs for the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, so Wilson appealed to him for information. As it happened, King did not know Peccei, but he was equally impressed by the ADELA paper and tracked down its author via the Italian Embassy in Paris. King wrote to Peccei, passing on Gvishiani's address and his wish to invite him to the Soviet Union, but also congratulating him on his paper and suggesting that they might meet some time as they obviously shared similar concerns. Peccei telephoned King and they arranged to have lunch. The two men got on well from the outset. They met several times in the latter part of 1967 and early-1968, and then decided that they had to do something constructive to encourage longer-range thinking among Western European governments. Peccei accordingly persuaded the Agnelli Foundation to fund a two-day brainstorming meeting on 7–8 April 1968 of around 30 European economists and scientists at the Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. The goal of the meeting was to discuss the ideas of Peccei and King of the globality of problems facing mankind and of the necessity of acting at the global level. The meeting at the Accademia dei Lincei was not a success, partly due to the difficulty of the participants to focus on a distant future. After the meeting there was an informal gathering of a few people in Peccei's home, which included Erich Jantsch (one of the great methodologists of planning studies), Alexander King, Hugo Thiemann, Lauro Gomes-Filho, Jean Saint-Geours, and Max Kohnstamm. According to King, within an hour they had decided to call themselves the Club of Rome and had defined the three major concepts that have formed the club's thinking ever since: a global perspective, the long-term, and the cluster of intertwined problems they called \\"the problematique\\". Although the Rome meeting had been convened with just Western Europe in mind, the group realised that they were dealing with problems of much larger scale and complexity—in short, \\"the predicament of mankind\\". The notion of problematique excited some because it seemed applicable at a universal level, but worried others, who felt that the approach was valid only for smaller entities such as a city or community. Saint-Geours and Kohnstamm therefore soon dropped out, leaving the others to pursue their informal programme of learning and debate. Thus started what Peccei called \\"the adventure of the spirit\\". He was fond of stating that, \\"If the Club of Rome has any merit, it is that of having been the first to rebel against the suicidal ignorance of the human condition.\\" Peccei felt \\"It is not impossible to foster a human revolution capable of changing our present course.\\" Aurelio Peccei's legacy About the same time, a study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), headed by Jay Forrester, began on the implications of continued growth on population increase, agricultural production, non-renewable resource depletion, industrial output, and pollution generation. He made an offer to the Club of Rome to adapt his dynamic model to handle global issues. A fortnight later, a group of club members visited Forrester at MIT and were convinced that the model could be made to work for the kind of global problems which interested the club. The results of the study were published in the 1972 book The Limits to Growth, which received both worldwide acclaim and strong criticism. In 1972, Peccei was one of the principal founders of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), in Laxenburg, Austria. This institute was formed after considerable struggle, but then served as an important bridge between East and West, partly because its founders included the United States (through the National Academy of Sciences), the Soviet Union (through the Soviet Academy of Sciences), Italy (through the Comitato Nazionale di Ricerche) and various other countries in the Western and Eastern sectors of the world. IIASA became a meeting place for scholars and scientists of different countries and provided a bridging function for the scientific world, producing important studies in different fields, including climate change, energy, and agriculture. It was during this same period that Peccei became involved in the World Wildlife Fund (now the World Wide Fund for Nature), becoming a member of its international board and becoming a strong supporter of their mission, not only internationally but also locally in Italy. In the early-1970s, several other studies were undertaken to improve upon The Limits to Growth, with varying degrees of support from the Club of Rome. Reflecting general criticism from the Third World, a Latin American model was developed by the Bariloche Institute in Argentina. The Club of Rome helped to find funding for the project, but did not give its imprimatur to the final report (\\"Catastrophe or New Society?\\", A.O. Herrera et al., 1976). With the idea of placing greater stress on the human dimension, Peccei approached the Dutch economist and Nobel laureate Jan Tinbergen and proposed a study of the likely impact of a doubling of the population on the global community. Tinbergen and his colleague Hans Linnemann came to the conclusion that the topic was unmanageably large and decided to focus on the problems of food for a doubling world population. When this was put to the Club of Rome, Peccei and others disagreed strongly, feeling that other aspects such as strains on housing, urban infrastructure, and employment should not be ignored. Ultimately Linnemann and his group pursued their research with funds they had already raised in the Netherlands and published their results independently, not as a report to the Club of Rome. In that same month, OPEC met, resulting in the first oil shock of 1973. The framework of discussion changed radically, at least for a while, and the club was to become involved in the United Nations debate on the New International Economic Order (NIEO). Peccei persuaded the Austrian Chancellor, Bruno Kreisky, to host a meeting on North-South problems in February 1974 in Salzburg, Austria. Besides Bruno Kreisky, the following heads of state of government were present in Salzburg: Leopold Senghor, President of Senegal; Luis Echeverría, President of Mexico; Joop den Uyl, Prime Minister of the Netherlands; Olof Palme, Prime Minister of Sweden; Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada; as well as the representatives of the prime ministers of Algeria and Ireland. Peccei deliberately did not invite any of the major European powers, the US, or the Soviet Union so as to prevent the debate turning into a forum for national or ideological position statements. To encourage the participants to speak freely, they were asked to come without accompanying civil servants and assured that nothing they said would be attributed to them. The two-day private brainstorming meeting ended with a press conference for 300 journalists. As a logical extension of the Salzburg meeting, Peccei asked Jan Tinbergen to produce a follow-up report on global food and development policies, exploring these aspects much more thoroughly than the coverage in The Limits to Growth. Scholars from the First, Second and Third Worlds were invited to participate in the RIO project (Reshaping the International Order), though only Poland and Bulgaria accepted from the Communist bloc. The basic thesis was that the gap between rich and poor countries (with the wealthiest roughly 13 times richer than the poorest) was intolerable and the situation was inherently unstable, and that ways should be found to reduce the gap to 6:1 over the next 15 to 30 years. Unlike The Limits to Growth, the model allowed the developing countries five percent growth per annum, whereas the industrialised countries would have zero or negative growth. According to the report, all would benefit from more sensible use of energy and other resources and a more equitable distribution of global wealth. The main report argued that people in the rich countries would have to change their patterns of consumption and accept lower profits, but a dissenting group saw consumption as a symptom rather than a cause of the problems, which stemmed rather from the fundamental power structure. After numerous working sessions and presentations over an 18-month period, the final results of RIO were presented at a meeting in Algiers in October 1976 and accepted as a report to the Club of Rome. The report did not have the hoped-for impact. The last meeting Peccei organized and participated in was in Bogotá, Colombia, on 15–17 December 1983, with the title \\"Development in a World of Peace\\". Co-organizer of the meeting with Peccei was the President of Colombia, Belisario Betancur. Peccei visited Las Gaviotas in the Vichada and endorsed the project of Paolo Lugari to regenerate the rain forest that was destroyed by decades of extensive cattle farming.

History The Calcutta and Burmah Steam Navigation Company had been formed out of Mackinnon, Mackenzie & Co, a trading partnership of the Scots William Mackinnon and Robert Mackenzie, to carry mail between Calcutta and Rangoon. It became British India SN Co in 1862. Under the hand of Lord Inchcape, who had become chairman in 1913, the company became part of the P&O; group of companies in 1914 through a complex amalgamation, but continued with its own identity and organisation for another nearly 60 years until 1972, when it was entirely absorbed into P&O.; Fleet & Routes As one of the largest shipowners of all time, the company owned more than 500 ships and managed 150 more for other owners. At its height in 1922, BI had more than 160 ships in the fleet, many built on Clydeside, Scotland. The main shipping routes of the line were: Britain to India, Australia, Kenya, Tanganyika. The company ran services from India to Pakistan, Ceylon, Bay of Bengal, Singapore, Malaya, Java, Thailand, Japan, Persian Gulf, East Africa and South Africa. BI had a long history of service to the British and Indian governments through trooping and other military contracts. In the last decade of its operational existence BI carried thousands of school children on educational cruises. The SS Mantola was sunk in February 1917 by a torpedo from a German submarine off the coast of Ireland with a substantial cargo of silver bullion. The cargo ship , carrying silver bullion, pig iron and tea, which was sunk at great depth by the in February 1941 some southwest of Galway Bay, Ireland, carried the richest cargo of any sunken ship in world history.C. Michael Hogan. 2011 Some of the company's better known passenger ships included , , , , Leicestershire, , the sister ships and , and and , and , which was sunk by a terrorist bomb in 1961. of 1956 was the final passenger ship built for BI. Serving as a troopship until redundant in 1962, Nevasa was assigned new duties with the BI educational cruise ship flotilla until 1974, when she became uneconomic due a four fold increase in crude oil prices and was scrapped in 1975 having earlier been joined in this trade by the more economic Uganda. The highly popular Uganda was taken up (STUFT) by the British Ministry of Defence in 1982 as a hospital ship during the Falklands war with Argentina. Returning to BI's tradition of government service again in 1983 – this time as a troopship – Uganda was \\"the last BI\\" when finally withdrawn in 1985. Dwarka holds the distinction of closing British-India's true \\"liner\\" services, when withdrawn from the company's Persian Gulf local trades in 1982, in her 35th year.

Dinitz played a major role in coordinating the weapons shipments to Israel received from the U.S. during the Yom Kippur War airlift in 1973, and was a member of the Israeli delegation during the Camp David peace talks with Egypt. In the 1984 elections he was elected to the Knesset on the Alignment's list and served as a member of its Committee for Foreign and Defense Affairs. However, he resigned from the Knesset shortly before the 1988 elections. From 1986 Dinitz served as Chairman of the Executive of the World Zionist Organization and Jewish Agency for Israel. During his time in office, almost 1 million Jews (about 7% of the entire Jewish population in the world) emigrated to Israel from the Soviet Union and other countries. In addition, he coordinated Operation Solomon, in which over 14,000 Ethiopian Jews were airlifted to safety in Israel in one day in May 1991. In 1995, Dinitz was forced to step down after he was indicted for two charges of theft.\\"Ex-chief of Jewish Agency is guilty of credit card fraud\\" Dinitz claimed that these were accounting errors, and was tried in the Jerusalem District Court.

For one week at a time, GATE students come to the park and learn about the surroundings, and other science related topics. The students go on hikes and learn about the trees and birds, take a day to collect samples from Galindo Creek which flows through the park, and care for the many animals that reside in the Markhams' old farmhouse. The animals range from snakes to mice to turtles, and a toad named \\"Alligator\\" who lives in the bathtub.

Dips are used to add flavor or texture to a food, such as pita bread, dumplings, crackers, cut-up raw vegetables, fruits, seafood, cubed pieces of meat and cheese, potato chips, tortilla chips, falafel, and sometimes even whole sandwiches in the case of au jus. Unlike other sauces, instead of applying the sauce to the food, the food is typically put, dipped, or added into the dipping sauce (hence the name). Dips are commonly used for finger foods, appetizers, and other food types. Thick dips based on sour cream, crème fraîche, milk, yogurt, mayonnaise, soft cheese, or beans are a staple of American hors d'oeuvres and are thinner than spreads which can be thinned to make dips. Alton Brown suggests that a dip is defined based on its ability to \\"maintain contact with its transport mechanism over three feet of white carpet\\". Dips in various forms are eaten all over the world and people have been using sauces for dipping for thousands of years.The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink. p. 145.

She has been a political representative for Inuit at the regional, national and international levels, most recently as International Chair for Inuit Circumpolar Council (formerly the Inuit Circumpolar Conference). Watt-Cloutier has worked on a range of social and environmental issues affecting Inuit, most recently, persistent organic pollutants and global warming. She has received numerous awards and honors for her work, and has been featured in a number of documentaries and profiled by journalists from all media. Watt-Cloutier sits as an advisor to Canada's Ecofiscal Commission. She is also a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation. Early life and career Sheila Watt-Cloutier was born in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, Northern Quebec, Canada. Her mother was known as a skillful healer and interpreter throughout Nunavik, and her father was an officer for the RCMP. For the first ten years of her life, Sheila was raised traditionally, traveling on the land by dog sled, before she was sent away for school in Nova Scotia and Churchill, Manitoba. In the mid-1970s, she worked for the Ungava Hospital as an Inuktitut translator and strived to improve education and health conditions. From 1991 to 1995, she worked as a counsellor in the review process of the education system of Northern Quebec. This work led to the 1992 report on the educational system in Nunavik, Silaturnimut - The Pathway to Wisdom. Watt-Cloutier also contributed significantly to the youth awareness video Capturing Spirit: The Inuit Journey.Sheila Watt-Cloutier's Biography at the Government of Canada's Networks of Centres of Excellence Watt-Cloutier has a daughter, a son, and a grandson. Currently, Sheila Watt-Cloutier lives in Kuujjuaq, Nunavik, Canada. Political positions Watt-Cloutier has been a political representative for Inuit for over a decade. From 1995 to 1998, she was Corporate Secretary of Makivik Corporation, the Canadian Inuit land-claim organization established for Northern Quebec (Nunavik) under the 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement. In 1995, she was elected President of Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC) Canada, and re-elected in 1998. ICC represents internationally the interests of Inuit in Russia, Alaska, Canada and Greenland. In this position, she served as the spokesperson for Arctic indigenous peoples in the negotiation of the Stockholm Convention banning the manufacture and use of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) or DDT. These substances pollute the Arctic food chain and accumulate in the bodies of Inuit, many of whom continue to subsist on local country food.See the Arctic Monitoring Assessment Programme (AMAP) for more information on POPs in the Arctic. In 2002, she was electedICUN - The World Conservation Union International Chair of ICC, a position she would hold until 2006. Most recently, her work has emphasized the human face of the impacts of global climate change in the Arctic. On December 7, 2005, based on the findings of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, which projects that Inuit hunting culture may not survive the loss of sea ice and other changes projected over the coming decades, she launched the world's first international legal action on climate change: a petition, along with 62 Inuit Hunters and Elders from communities across Canada and Alaska, to the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights, alleging that unchecked emissions of greenhouse gases from the United States have violated Inuit cultural and environmental human rights as guaranteed by the 1948 American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man.Sheila Watt-Cloutier's Petition to the Inter- American Commission on Human Rights at the ICC, 7 December 2005.

A \\"first call\\" guitarist at Warner Brothers Studios, in the late 1940s Timbrell appeared in several motion pictures playing as part of a band. His reputation was such that he was hired to play guitar on recording sessions for singing stars such as Doris Day, Billy Vaughn & His Orchestra, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Harry James, and pop and country music artists such as Ricky Nelson and Marty Robbins. Perhaps most significantly in his career, Timbrell played rhythm guitar for Elvis Presley, first at Radio Recorders studios in Los Angeles for the making of the soundtrack for the film, Loving You and later on numerous other soundtracks for Presley films. In 1943 Timbrell married Margaret Ellen Scott. They had two children: Gail and Jay. Gail married and had three children: Roger, Nancy, and Steven. Steven followed his grandfather into the entertainment industry. He works as a Local 1 stagehand in New York City.

Dalton is north of the Hume Highway that joins Sydney and Melbourne, between Goulburn and Yass in southern New South Wales, southwest of Sydney and north of the national capital, Canberra. Nearby towns are Cullerin, Gundaroo, Gunning, Yass, and Murrumbateman. The town was gazetted in 1862. The name was derived from the family name of the wife of the then Governor of New South Wales The Rt Hon. Sir John Young; her name was Adelaide Annabella Tuite daughter of Edward Tuite Dalton. Economy The Monaro region is renowned for its sheep wool industry, notably for the Merino breed. The dry-land farming supports both summer and winter wheat, and some other cereal crops, but agriculture also extends to cattle production for meat.Farming Systems (South) n.d., NSW Department of Primary Industries, viewed 31 October 2015 at http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/research/areas/productivity/s-farming-systems The vibrancy of Dalton's heyday in the 19th century as a sheep-shearing centre is gone, lost in 1875Gunning Railway Precinct, 2009, NSW Government Office of Environment & Heritage,27 October, viewed on 31 October 2015, at http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=4806268 when the train line was routed through nearby Gunning rather than Dalton. Today the town is taking on a new role as a rural-residential centre, with generally well-maintained wide streets and churches, a school, a viable hotel (pub), post office services, and a petrol station. Geology and earthquakes The underlying rock strata of the region from Dalton to Lake George some east is geologically active, with the lake formed along a fault system running north–south. Dalton has a significantly higher rate of earthquakes and tremors than the background rate for the eastern highlands of Australia, and because their foci are very shallow (usually less than 1 km deep) the damage they cause is often disproportionately high: events as low as magnitude ML3.0 have damaged buildings in the region.McCue, K., Kennett, B.L.N., Gaull, B.A., Michael-Leiba, M.O., Weekes, J. & Krayshck, C.

This line was manufactured by Cessna from 1966 to 1985 under the name Utiliner and Businessliner.Montgomery, MR & Gerald Foster: A Field Guide to Airplanes, Second Edition, page 108. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1992. All seats are easily removable so that the aircraft can be used in an all- cargo configuration. Neither the Cessna 401 nor the 402 were pressurized, nor were they particularly fast for the installed horsepower. Instead, Cessna intended them to be inexpensive to purchase and operate. Development Cabin The Cessna 401 and 402 were developed to be non-pressurized twin engine piston aircraft. Their goal was to be a workhorse, useful to cargo and small commuter airlines among other users. The Cessna 401 and 402 were developments of the Cessna 411. One goal for the Cessna 401/402 was to improve upon the very bad single engine handling of the Cessna 411. Another goal was to avoid using the somewhat expensive and maintenance prone geared engines of the Cessna 411. Cessna 401s and 402s are powered by turbocharged Continental engines with three-bladed, constant speed, fully feathering propellers. On later models cruise power was limited to 75% to reduce cabin noise. Some aircraft have a propeller synchrophaser to reduce cabin noise and vibration. The FAA granted certification to the Cessna 401 in October 1968 and the 402 in January 1969. The original Cessna 402 was introduced in 1967. A version without the large cargo door called the Cessna 401 was produced at the same time. In 1969, the 402's nose was stretched for added baggage space. This model was renamed the 402A. The 401 kept the original nose. In 1970, various minor changes were made. Also, optional larger (184 gallon) fuel tanks became available. This model was called the 402B. By 1971, sales of the 401 had slowed to only 21 planes, so the model was discontinued. Between 1971 and 1977, many changes were made to the airframe, including an optional engine fire extinguisher (1971), simpler exhaust system (1972), enlarged passenger windows (1973), equipment for flight into known icing conditions (1975), and an optional flushing toilet (1977). In 1976, the very similar Cessna 421 was produced with a new wing, no tip tanks, and a simpler fuel system. The Cessna 414 was given a clean wing in 1978. In 1979, the 402s received a new wing, with a five-foot greater span. The landing gear was replaced, using the simpler system from the Cessna 414. The landing gear track was also increased by four feet. The engines’ output was boosted to 325 hp each and max gross weight increased to 6,850 pounds, creating a much more useful airplane. Fuel capacity was increased to 213 gallons. Even with the weight increase, single-engine performance went up and the stall speed went down by a couple of knots. After this change, the plane was named the Cessna 402C. Production stopped after the 1985 model year. =Modifications= In 1969, American Jet Industries began work on a turboprop-powered conversion of the Cessna 402, named the Turbo Star 402, using Allison 250-B17 engines. The prototype flew on 10 June 1970. Further modifications providing increased fuel capacity, higher gross weight, and lower minimum control speed were carried out in 1974 and the modification was re-certified. Scenic Airlines of Las Vegas purchased rights to the design in 1977. The Cessna 402C may be outfitted with vortex generators to increase maximum allowable takeoff weight to , with a zero-fuel weight of . Another modification for the 402C increases the maximum landing weight to , which allows commercial operators to fly with an increased payload on shorter routes. Hendrik Venter of DMI engineering created the Falcon 402: a converted Cessna 402 fitted with a single Walter M601D turboprop in the nose and replacing the two piston engines in the wings with new fuel tanks. The nose was lengthened in order to correct the centre of gravity. It has an increased payload and top speed and can use shorter runways Variants Early models have four oval windows, a short nose and tip tanks. Later 402Cs have five windows, a longer nose for luggage and no tip tanks. This family of aircraft was built in several versions: ; :Six to eight seat interior, intended for corporate transport.

Operators Cape Air Cessna 402Cs at Boston Logan =Civilian= The Cessna 402 has proven to be very dependable over the years, which, along with its range and passenger capacity, has made it a popular choice for many small regional airlines worldwide. The aircraft are generally flown on short, thin routes to hubs where passengers can connect to higher density routes. The largest operator of the type is Cape Air, which as of June 2019 has a fleet of 88 Cessna 402s operating in the Caribbean, Micronesia and United States. =Military= Swedish Coast Guard in 1981thumbright ; *Barbados Defence Force ; * Bolivian Air Force * Bolivian Naval Force ; ;. *Comoros Police Defence Air Wing\\"World Military Aircraft Inventory\\", Aerospace Source Book 2007, Aviation Week & Space Technology, January 15, 2007. ; * Finnish Air Force two aircraft, former operator ; *Haiti Air Corps ; * Royal Malaysian Air Force, ; *Mexican Navy ; *Portuguese Air Force – One 402B operated 1968–1974. ; *Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force – One 401 operated 1986. ; *Venezuelan NavyFlight International 30 November 1985, p. 99. *Venezuelan National Guard – One 402C operated 1986.

Launched in 1758, she saw active service in the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War. She was wrecked in Jamaica Bay, near New York, in 1778. Construction Liverpool was an oak-built 28-gun sixth-rate, one of 18 vessels forming part of the Coventry class of frigates. As with others in her class she was loosely modeled on the design and external dimensions of , launched in 1756 and responsible for capturing five French privateers in her first twelve months at sea.Winfield 2007, pp. 227–228 The Admiralty Order to build the Coventry-class vessels was made after the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, and at a time in which the Royal Dockyards were fully engaged in constructing or fitting-out the Navy's ships of the line. Consequently, despite Navy Board misgivings about reliability and cost, contracts for all but one of Coventry-class vessels were issued to private shipyards with an emphasis on rapid completion of the task. Contracts for Liverpools construction were issued on 3 September 1756 to commercial shipwrights John Gorill and William Pownall. As Gorill and Pownall's shipyard was in the city of Liverpool, Admiralty determined that this would also be the name of the vessel herself. It was stipulated that work should be completed within eleven months for a 28-gun vessel measuring approximately 590tons burthen. Subject to satisfactory completion, Gorill and Pownall would receive a modest fee of £8.7s per ton the lowest for any Coventry-class vessel to be paid through periodic imprests drawn against the Navy Board.Winfield 2007, pp. 229–230Baugh 1965, pp.255–256 Private shipyards were not subject to rigorous naval oversight, and the Admiralty therefore granted authority for \\"such alterations withinboard as shall be judged necessary\\" in order to cater for the preferences or ability of individual shipwrights, and for experimentation with internal design. Liverpools keel was laid down on 1 October 1756, but work proceeded slowly and the completed vessel was not ready for launch until 10 February 1758, a full six months behind schedule. As built, Liverpool was slightly longer and narrower than her sister ships in the Coventry-class, being long with a keel, a beam of and with a hold depth of . Her tons burthen were measured at 589 tons. Navy frigates were routinely fitted out and armed at Royal Dockyards, but Liverpool received her guns while still at the builder's yard. These comprised 24 nine-pounder cannons to be located along her gun deck, supported by four three-pounder cannons on the quarterdeck and twelve -pounder swivel guns ranged along her sides. The vessel was named after the city of Liverpool in North West England. In selecting her name the Board of Admiralty continued a tradition, dating to 1644, of using geographic features; overall, ten of the nineteen Coventry-class vessels, were named after well-known regions, rivers or towns.Winfield 2007, pp. 227–231 With few exceptions the remainder of the class were named after figures from classical antiquity, following a more modern trend initiated in 1748 by John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich in his capacity as First Lord of the Admiralty. In sailing qualities Liverpool was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed which provided ample space for provisions, the ship's mess and a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Liverpool to remain at sea for long periods without resupply.Gardiner 1992, pp. 107108 She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the weight of her hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.Gardiner 1992, pp. 111112 Her designated complement was 200, comprising two commissioned officers a captain and a lieutenant overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers, 91 naval ratings, 38 Marines and 29 servants and other ranks.Rodger 1986, pp.348351 Among these other ranks were four positions reserved for widow's men fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea. Seven Years' War Plan showing the body plan, sheer lines with inboard detail and longitudinal half breadth as proposed for the Liverpool, 1756 Liverpool was launched on 10 February 1758 and immediately commissioned into the Navy under the command of Captain Richard Knight. After taking on her crew, she was assigned to the Royal Navy squadron patrolling the English Channel near Dunkirk, on watch for French vessels seeking to prey on British merchant shipping. On 11 May 1759 Liverpool captured L'Emerillon, an 8-gun French privateer. The vessel and her 52 crew were subsequently delivered to British authorities at Yarmouth. Two further victories followed, with the capture of La Nouvelle Hirondelle on 7 July and Le Glaneur on 20 November. In March 1760 she was reassigned to convoy protection duties, between Britain and colonial outposts in the East Indies and North America. After two years she was again reassigned, as a support vessel for the Royal Navy's loose blockade of the port of Brest. In this role Liverpool was responsible for carrying messages between the blockading ships, and watching for French attempts to leave port. On 25 April 1762, while still engaged in these duties, the frigate encountered and overwhelmed Le Grand Admiral, a privateer from Bayonne. This was Richard Knight's last engagement as captain of Liverpool; in June 1762 he relinquished his command and returned to England. In Knight's absence, Liverpool secured her fifth victory at sea with the capture of French privateer Le Jacques. Liverpools captaincy was filled in September with the appointment of Edward Clark, formerly the first lieutenant of the 14-gun sloop . War with France was drawing to a close, and by January 1763 negotiations were well advanced for the peace settlement that would be finalised in the Treaty of Paris. On 20 January 1763 Clark was ordered to sail for the East Indies with news of imminent peace. Captain Clarke committed suicide in March 1764, during Liverpools return voyage. On reaching England, the frigate was declared surplus to the Navy's peacetime requirements, and taken to Woolwich Dockyard for decommissioning. Inter-war period Liverpool underwent a \\"great repair\\" between March 1766 and April 1767, and was re-commissioned in March 1767. She was subsequently ordered to Newfoundland. After two years service there, she journeyed to the Mediterranean, remaining there until her eventual return for paying off in Chatham, England in March 1772. American Revolutionary War Liverpool was re-commissioned in July 1775, shortly after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Command was given to Captain Henry Bellew, with the frigate setting sail for North America on 14 September. On January 1, 1776, she participated in the bombardment of Norfolk, Virginia with John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore as one of three English warships in his fleet. A cannonball fired from her onboard batteries is currently still lodged in the wall of Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia). On 26 August 1776 she was on patrol off Nova Scotia when she encountered two rebel schooners, USS Warren and USS Lynch. The American vessels fled in separate directions, with Bellew electing to follow Warren. After a short chase the American schooner was overhauled and captured; she was transformed into a ship's tender for Liverpool and her crew kept under guard until September when they were transferred to along with Warrens guns. In 1777, Liverpool was added to a fleet under the overall command of Viscount Howe. On 11 February 1778, she was wrecked in Jamaica Bay, Long Island.

KQGO is owned and operated by Go Media. KQGO's studios are located in the Ford Building on Fifth Street across from Target Field (and the similarly named Metro station) in downtown Minneapolis, while its transmitter is located in New Hope. History =Origins= The frequency was originally licensed as KQXA by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 15, 1991. In August 1993, the station signed on as KARP, playing a wide mix of classic rock, oldies, country music and farm reports. The station's transmitter was initially located west of Le Sueur. To increase the value of the station, KARP's owners decided to seek FCC permission to increase power and move their transmitter closer to the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. The transmitter was moved farther north and east, first to a location south of Hutchinson, then to a location near Watertown, and power was increased from 50,000 watts to 100,000 watts, giving the station a city-grade signal over much of the west metro area. The move also resulted in WJMC-FM/96.3 in Rice Lake, Wisconsin downgrading from 100 kW to 50 kW, changing its frequency to 96.1 FM, and moving its transmitter north. The actions were approved by the FCC in September 1999.Broadcasting News-September 1999 =B96 (2000–2010)= In February 2000, KARP was purchased by a group consisting of local investors Kandu Communications and Cincinnati, Ohio-based Blue Chip Broadcasting, with the aim of bringing a quasi-urban-formatted music FM station to Minnesota for the first time. The station moved its transmitter to a new site later that month.Broadcasting News-January 2000 The transfer in ownership to Blue Chip Broadcasting took place just after Noon on May 18, 2000. The station played all requests during the morning hours, with goodbyes from the DJ's and other staff. Morning hosts John Carrigan and John Mons gave a final farewell, followed by \\"Happy Trails.\\" They also announced that the KARP call sign and format would be moving to KKJR (106.9 FM) in Hutchinson, on June 1. Following KARP's departure from 96.3 FM, the station began stunting, repeating a short list of songs from Prince and Janet Jackson.Broadcasting News-May 2000 The new B96 (KTTB) debuted on May 31, 2000.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2000/RR-2000-06-09.pdf In May 2001, Blue Chip sold the station to Radio One, a company that specializes in urban formats. However, Radio One allowed B96 to maintain its rhythmic formatted playlist (although B96 leaned towards urban and played some urban exclusive songs that most rhythmic stations normally didn't play).Broadcasting News-May 2001 Off to the \\"Northern Lights\\" On June 14, 2007, Northern Lights Broadcasting, owned by the family of Minnesota Twins owner Carl Pohlad, announced the purchase of KTTB from Radio One for $28 million (USD). The deal was approved by the FCC on August 20, 2007.Vomhof, John Jr Pohlads, Hasselquist team on BMW deal Minneapolis / St. Paul Business Journal December 21, 2007 Northern Lights had already stated that it would keep the station's staff and format intact.Northern Lights Broadcasting Acquires KTTB FM - B96 - Entertainment - redOrbit In September 2008, Northern Lights Broadcasting filed an application to change KTTB's city of license from Glencoe to Edina (the city in which the station's studios are located), move its transmitter to the tower in St. Louis Park used by AM stations WWTC and KYCR, and decrease its power (from 100,000 to 24,000 watts) and antenna height. Northern Lights purchased 1310 AM KRBI in St. Peter in late July, and changed its call sign to KGLB. It plans to change KGLB's city of license to Glencoe (which has no other radio stations licensed to it) to maintain local service to Glencoe. The deal was not approved, but Northern Lights' application to change KTTB's city of license to Edina, move the transmitter to New Hope, and decrease its power (from 100,000 to 19,000 watts) was approved, and KTTB began transmitting from New Hope on August 20, 2009. The move strengthened KTTB's signal in urbanized portions of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. The lower power, however, meant the station lost coverage in the nearby smaller markets of Mankato and St. Cloud, where it also had significant listenership. =96.3 Now (2010–2011)= 96.3 Now logo from 2010 to 2011 At Noon on January 6, 2010, Northern Lights changed the station's name to \\"96.3 Now\\" and call sign to KHTC, officially dropping the urban lean at the station, while retaining the rhythmic format. The final song on \\"B96\\" was \\"Say My Name\\" by Destiny's Child, while the first song on \\"Now\\" was Miley Cyrus' \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\". The move put KHTC in an even closer rivalry to mainstream Top 40 (CHR) station KDWB-FM. B96 Minneapolis is Nowhttp://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=834855&catid;=391 According to radio promos, the station also featured Commercial-Free Mondays. While they were moving closer towards KDWB's format, KHTC's Program Director Sam Elliott insisted that \\"96.3 Now\\" would continue to have a Rhythmic flavor, will be more \\"Dance-oriented\\" than KDWB, will not play any songs that are too \\"Disney Pop\\", and will not add any pop/rock artists (like Nickelback). KHTC remained a reporter in Nielsen BDS' Rhythmic Airplay Panel as well as on Mediabase's Rhythmic Chart because of its rhythmic direction and playlist, and therefore did not meet the criteria to be included on their mainstream Top 40/CHR reporting panels.\\"B96 Changes Format to Top 40\\" from Metromix Twincities (January 6, 2010) =96.3 K-Twin (2012–2014)= K-Twin logo (2012-2014) On December 29, 2011, Northern Lights announced that KHTC would drop the rhythmic format and \\"Now\\" branding on January 1, 2012, and shift to a modern adult contemporary format, branded as \\"96.3 K-Twin.\\" \\"K-Twin In The Twin Cities?\\" from RadioInsight.com, updated 12/29/2011 At Midnight on January 1 (after \\"In Paris\\" by Jay-Z and Kanye West), the station officially flipped to the new format, with \\"Misery\\" by Minneapolis band Soul Asylum being the first song being played, followed by \\"Beautiful Day\\" by U2 and \\"Learn to Fly\\" by Foo Fighters. The \\"K-Twin\\" playlist featured, according to Northern Lights' preview of the change, \\"today’s guitar based, pop alternative music\\" and similar, gold-based hits from 1985 onward. \\"K-Twin,\\" though it was described as a modern adult contemporary format with an alternative rock lean, was classified as adult top 40 because of rhythmic content (such as Bruno Mars' \\"It Will Rain\\") and non-alternative classic hits (such as Def Leppard's \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\"), and to differ itself from Hot AC rival KSTP-FM (that station reports to the Mediabase/BDS hot AC panels). Even some 1970s staples could be found on the station, such as \\"Jammin'\\" by Bob Marley. The artist roster on \\"K-Twin\\" featured acts ranging from Bon Jovi and U2 to Adele and Green Day, along with songs and artists that, according to Northern Lights, \\"aren't currently being played in the (Twin Cities) market.\\" It leaned in a much older direction versus KSTP; however, as of April 2012, the station was listed on the Nielsen BDS hot AC panel. The station in the Modern AC era also competed against Cities 97, which shared many of the titles played. Another noticeable emphasis of \\"K-Twin\\" was its connections with Twin Cities listeners and its employment of local personalities, including a morning show (which debuted on January 4) that featured Tone E. Fly, a KDWB alum and a former \\"B96\\" and \\"96.3 Now\\" jock, former Miss Minnesota International contestant Danni Star who is also a former \\"Now\\" jock, and KARE news personality Eric Perkins. With the flip to \\"K-Twin\\", the station changed its call sign to KTWN- FM, which mirrors the calls on Northern Lights' country-formatted AM station in Glencoe. The calls and \\"K-Twin\\" branding were originally used by what is now KQQL from 1968 to 1983. By the spring of 2012, KTWN evolved to a straightforward hot adult contemporary format, playing hits from the 1980s, 1990s, 2000s and today. The station was trying to fill a void left by KSTP-FM, which has moved closer towards Top 40 (CHR). On August 15, 2012, the Minnesota Twins announced KTWN would be the team's new radio flagship, starting with the 2013 season.http://www.twincities.com/2012/08/14/minnesota-twins-radio-move- to-ktwn-fm-becomes-official/ By October 2013, KTWN transformed again, shifting away from Hot AC into more of a gold-based AAA direction with the addition of artists such as The Beatles, Neil Young, The Rolling Stones, The Who, and Led Zeppelin. However, KTWN occasionally threw in some 1990s songs from bands like Blues Traveler, Dave Matthews Band, Counting Crows, and Gin Blossoms. During its entire existence as \\"K-Twin\\", ratings for the station were anemic, usually below a 2 share of the market (with an average of a 1.7 share per ratings period). With the hybrid mix of baseball and music, the station stayed steady at a mere 1.0 share over the past three monthly ratings periods of 2014. In addition, the station has had a constant turnover in airstaff since launch, such as 96.3 veteran Tony Fly being let go in mid-2012. =Go 96.3 (2015–present)= In December 2014, morning host Eric Perkins (who was the final airstaff member from the station's initial launch) and afternoon host Curt Copeland left the station, as rumors abounded that 96.3 was about to undergo a major overhaul of its format, as nine new web domains were registered for the station. Morning show co-hosts Mark Rider and Rena Sarigianopoulos remained in place.What's GOing On At K-Twin? from Radio Insight December 5, 2014 The station enlisted Minneapolis branding agency Fellow to assist in the transition of the brand. At Midnight on January 1, 2015, 3 years to the hour after \\"K-Twin\\" debuted, after playing a set of songs with the word \\"go\\" in the title, as well as a block of \\"end\\"-themed songs (culminating with \\"Closing Time\\" by Minneapolis band Semisonic), KTWN-FM began stunting with a Siri-like text-to-speech voice quoting various movie and pop culture quotes, as well as a countdown to 3 p.m. on January 5. At that time, the station flipped to alternative rock as Go 96.3, launching with 10,000 songs in a row, starting with \\"Long Way Down\\" by Robert DeLong.KTWN GOes Alternative The station continued to be the home affiliate for the Twins until the 2017 season, when Twins broadcasts returned to WCCO. Minnesota Twins to Return to WCCO The Twins had previously been on WCCO radio since their first season in Minnesota in 1961 until the end of the 2006 season. About a month after the station's launch, the station added a full-time airstaff. The initial lineup of airstaff included Barb Abney from 8 AM-Noon, Brian \\"BT\\" Turner Noon-1 PM, Jason Nagel 1-4 PM and the duo of Thorn and Linnea Mohn 4-7 PM.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/91974/go-96-3-minneapolis-adds-barb- abney-sets-airstaff/ On April 6, 2015, the station launched GoTV, an in-booth music and video content streaming source.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/92648/go-96-3-minneapolis- launches-gotv/ With the Pohlads' purchase of KNOF in September 2015, KTWN was speculated to move to the newly acquired frequency, in order to take advantage of a larger coverage area. This comes as they have registered the domains Go953.com, G953MN.com and GoNorthMN.com.https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/94875/daily- domains-108-ktwn-going-to-new-frequencies/ Instead, a current-based rhythmic contemporary format, under the \\"Go 95.3\\" moniker, launched on that frequency at 3 PM on January 5, one year to the minute after KTWN launched the \\"Go\\" format.https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/95752/twin-gos-for- the-twin-cities/ On January 1, 2017, KTWN-FM changed their call letters to KQGO to match the \\"Go\\" branding. HD Radio KQGO broadcasts in HD Radio (digital). In addition to the HD1 channel, which mirrors the KQGO analog signal, KQGO has two other HD sub-channels. (more information about KQGO-HD2, and KQGO-HD3 can be found below) The station uses GO -FM as its HD Radio callsign display, as opposed to KQGO or KQGO-FM. HD2 KQGO-HD2 carries a simulcast of KBHL in Osakis, which was previously heard in the Twin Cities on KNOF before Go Media's acquisition of the station in 2016. HD3 As of September 9, 2020, KQGO-HD3 is simulcasting Hmong news, talk, and music formatted WIXK. This comes after Hmong Radio Broadcast, LLC's acquisition of previous KFAI translator K294AM. K294AM will relay KQGO-HD3.

Referred to colloquially as the \\"New Bankruptcy Law\\", the Act of Congress attempts to, among other things, make it more difficult for some consumers to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7; some of these consumers may instead utilize Chapter 13. It was passed by the 109th United States Congress on April 14, 2005 and signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 20, 2005. Most provisions of the act apply to cases filed on or after October 17, 2005.  Provisions  The Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act (BAPCPA) made changes to American bankruptcy laws, affecting both consumer and business bankruptcies. Many of the bill's provisions were explicitly designed by the bill's Congressional sponsors to make it \\"more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy.\\"Opening Statement of Sen. Chuck Grassley at the Bankruptcy Reform Hearing, 2005-02-10, Press Release, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa The BAPCPA was intended to make it more difficult for debtors to file a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy—under which most debts are forgiven (or discharged)--and instead required them to file a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy—under which the debts they incurred are discharged only after the debtor has repaid some portion of these debts. Some of the bill's more significant provisions include the following: =Presumption of abuse= Prior to the BAPCPA Amendments, debtors of all incomes could file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7. BAPCPA restricted the number of debtors that could declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The act sets out a method to calculate a debtor's income, and compares this amount to the median income of the debtor's state. If the debtor's income is above the median income amount of the debtor's state, the debtor is subject to a \\"means test.\\"Sahadi, Jeanne. \\"The new bankruptcy law and you\\". CNNMoney.com, October 17, 2005. Retrieved on April 12, 2007. The most noteworthy change brought by the 2005 BAPCPA amendments occurred within . Congress amended this section of the Bankruptcy Code to provide for the dismissal or conversion of a Chapter 7 case upon a finding of \\"abuse\\" by an individual debtor (or married couple) with \\"primarily consumer debt\\". The pre-BAPCPA language of § 707(b) provided for dismissal of a chapter 7 case upon a finding of \\"substantial abuse\\". Under the former § 707(b), only the court or the United States trustee could bring a motion to find abuse under the section. The 2005 amendments removed these restrictions. Post-BAPCPA, § 707(b) provides two definitions of \\"abuse\\". \\"Abuse\\" may be found when there is an unrebutted \\"presumption of abuse\\" arising under a BAPCPA-created \\"means test\\", [see ], or through a finding of bad faith, determined by a totality of the circumstances [see ]. Means test Only debtors whose monthly income is higher than the median income of their state, as calculated by the Code, are subject to being found abusive under § 707(b)(2). Debtors whose income falls below the median income figure may be in violation of the means test, however no party is permitted to file a motion in order to find abuse under § 707(b)(2), [see ]. This creates a means test \\"safe harbor\\" for debtors below the state's median income figure. Current monthly income is defined in as the monthly average of the income received by the debtor (and the debtor's spouse in a joint case) during a defined six-month time period prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case. Some narrow classes of payments, for example, social security, are excluded from these figures. Notably, the average income may be higher or lower than the debtor's actual income at the time of filing for bankruptcy. This has led some commentators to refer to the bankruptcy code's \\"current monthly income\\" as \\"presumed income\\". If the debtor's debt is not primarily consumer debt, then the means test is inapplicable. The applicable median income figure is adjusted by family size. Generally, the larger the family, the greater the applicable median income figure and the more money the debtor must earn before a presumption of abuse arises. A chart of the most recent applicable median incomes by state can be found at the US Trustee's website.Census Bureau Median Family Income By Family Size, U.S. Trustee Program, Department of Justice This code section then requires a comparison between the debtor's \\"current monthly income\\" and the median income for the debtor's state. If the debtor's income exceeds the median income, then the debtor must apply the means test. For debtors subject to the means test, the test is calculated as follows. The debtor's \\"current monthly income\\" is reduced by a set of allowed deductions specified by the IRS. These deductions are not necessarily the actual expenses the debtor incurs on a monthly basis. Some commentators have referred to these deductions as \\"presumed expenses\\". The deductions applicable in the \\"means test\\" are defined in , (ii)-(iv) and include: *living expenses specified under the \\"collection standards of the Internal Revenue Service\\", *actual expenses not provided by the Internal Revenue Standards including \\"reasonably necessary health insurance, disability insurance, and health savings account expenses\\", *expenses for protection from family violence, *continued contributions to care of nondependent family members, *actual expenses of administering a chapter 13 plan, *expenses for grade and high school, up to $1,500 annually per minor child provided that the expenses are reasonable and necessary, *additional home energy costs in addition to those laid out in the IRS guidelines that are reasonable and necessary, *1/60th of all secured debt that will become due in the five years after the filing of the bankruptcy case, *1/60th of all priority debt, and *continued contributions to tax-exempt charities. An itemized list of the applicable IRS living standards can be found at the US Trustee's website. A \\"presumption of abuse\\" will arise if: (1) the debtor has at least $182.50 in current monthly income available after the allowed deductions (this equals $10,950 over five years) regardless of the amount of debt, or (2) the debtor has at least $109.59 of such income ($6,575 over five years) and this sum would be enough to pay general unsecured creditors more than 25% over five years. For example, if a debtor had exactly $109.59 of \\"current monthly income\\" left after deductions and owed less than $26,300 in general unsecured debt, then the presumption of abuse would arise, [see ]. If a presumption of abuse is found under the means test, it may only be rebutted in the case of \\"special circumstances\\", [see ].  Nonpresumed abuse  Even in cases where there is no presumption of abuse, it is still possible for a Chapter 7 case to be dismissed or converted. If the debtor's \\"current monthly income\\" is below the median income, as discussed above, only the court or the United States trustee (or bankruptcy administrator) can seek dismissal or conversion of the debtor's case. If the debtor's \\"current monthly income\\" is above the median income, as discussed above, any party in interest may seek dismissal or conversion of the case. The grounds for dismissal under are the filing of a petition in \\"bad faith\\", or when \\"the totality of the circumstances (including whether the debtor seeks to reject a personal services contract and the financial need for such rejection as sought by the debtor) of the debtor's financial situation demonstrates abuse.\\" = Waiting period between filings = Another change that resulted from the BAPCPA was an extension of the time between multiple bankruptcy filings. was amended to provide that the debtor would be denied a discharge if a debtor had received a discharge in a prior Chapter 7 case filed within eight (8) years of the filing of the present case. Prior to BAPCPA, the rule was six (6) years between chapter 7 filings. BAPCPA did not change the rule for the waiting period if the debtor filed a chapter 13 previously. = Credit counseling and debtor education requirements = Another major change to the law enacted by BAPCPA deals with eligibility. Section 109(h) provides that a debtor will no longer be eligible to file under either chapter 7 or chapter 13 unless within 180 days prior to filing the debtor received an \\"individual or group briefing\\" from a nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency approved by the United States trustee or bankruptcy administrator. The new legislation also requires that all individual debtors in either chapter 7 or chapter 13 complete an \\"instructional course concerning personal financial management.\\" If a chapter 7 debtor does not complete the course, it constitutes grounds for denial of discharge pursuant to new . The financial management program is experimental and the effectiveness of the program is to be studied for 18 months. Theoretically, if the educational courses prove to be ineffective, the requirement may disappear. In 2006 more than half of all certified pre-filing counseling sessions were rendered by the three largest agencies: Money Management International, Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Greater Atlanta and GreenPath Debt Solutions. A 2007 GAO report was inconclusive regarding the efficacy of the counseling provisions and concluded that there is no mechanism in place to evaluate it:Bankruptcy Reform: Value of Credit Counseling Requirement Is Not Clear = Applicability of Automatic Stay = The automatic stay in bankruptcy is the court order that requires all collection proceedings to stop. There are exceptions, of course, but generally this is the term for the \\"relief\\" from collection proceedings a debtor receives by filing the bankruptcy with the bankruptcy clerk's office. BAPCPA limited the protections the stay provides in some re-filed cases. New § 362(c)(3) provides that if the debtor files a chapter 7, 11 or 13 case within one year of the dismissal of an earlier case, the automatic stay in the present case terminates 30 days after the filing, unless the debtor or some other party in interest files a motion and demonstrates that the present case was filed in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed. If the present case is a third filing within one (1) year, the automatic stay does not go into effect at all, unless the debtor or any other party in interest files a motion to impose the stay that demonstrates that the third filing is in good faith with respect to the creditor, or creditors, being stayed. The provision presumes that the repeat filings are not in good faith and requires the party seeking to impose the stay (usually the debtor) to rebut the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. There are exceptions. Notably, § 362(i) provides that the presumption that the repeat filing was not in good faith would not arise in a \\"subsequent\\" case if a debtor's prior case was dismissed \\"due to the creation of a debt repayment plan.\\" BAPCPA also limited the applicability of the automatic stay in eviction proceedings. The stay does not stop an eviction proceeding if the landlord has already obtained a judgment of possession prior to the bankruptcy case being filed, § 362(b)(22). The stay also would not apply in a situation where the eviction is based on \\"endangerment\\" of the rented property or \\"illegal use of controlled substances\\" on the property, § 362(b)(23). In either situation the landlord must file with the court and serve on the debtor a certificate of non-applicability of the stay spelling out the facts giving rise to one of the exceptions. There is a process for the debtor to contest the assertions in the landlord's certificate or if state law gives the debtor an additional right to cure the default even after an order for possession is entered, § 362(l) & (m). In addition, BAPCPA extends the exceptions to automatic stay to certain paternity, child custody, domestic violence and domestic and child support proceedings. = Stricter notice requirements = BAPCPA enacts a provision that protects creditors from monetary penalties for violating the stay if the debtor did not give \\"effective\\" notice pursuant to § 342, [§ 342(g)]. The new notice provisions require the debtor to give notice of the bankruptcy to the creditor at an \\"address filed by the creditor with the court,\\" or \\"at an address stated in two communications from the creditor to the debtor within 90 days of the filing of the bankruptcy case. The notice must also include the account number used by the creditor in the two relevant communications [§ 342(c)(2)(e) & (f)]. An ineffective notice can be cured if the notice is later \\"brought to the attention of the creditor.\\" This means that the notice must be received by a person designated by the creditor to receive bankruptcy notices. = Dischargeability = BAPCPA also provided more protections to creditors because it expanded the exceptions to discharge. The presumption of fraud in the use of credit cards was expanded. The amount that the debtor must charge for \\"luxury goods\\" to invoke the presumption is reduced from $1,225 to $500. The amount of cash advances that would give rise to a presumption of fraud has also been reduced, from $1,225 to $750. The time period was increased from 60 days to 90 days. Thus, if a debtor purchases any single item for more than $500 within 90 days of filing, the presumption that the debt was incurred fraudulently and therefore non-dischargeable in the bankruptcy arises. Prior to BAPCPA, the presumption would not have arisen unless the purchase was for more than $1,225 and was made within 60 days of filing (§ 523(a)(2)(C)). BAPCPA amended § 523(a)(8) to broaden the types of educational (\\"student\\") loans that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy absent proof of \\"undue hardship.\\" The nature of the lender is no longer relevant. Thus, even loans from \\"for-profit\\" or \\"non-governmental\\" entities are not dischargeable. = Lien avoidance = Some types of liens may be avoided through a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. However, BAPCPA limited the ability of debtors to avoid liens through bankruptcy. The definition of \\"household goods\\" was changed—for example, by limiting \\"electronic equipment\\" to one radio, one television, one VCR, and one personal computer with related equipment. The definition now excludes certain items such as works of art not created by the debtor or a relative of the debtor, jewelry worth more than $500, with adjustment for inflation (except wedding rings), and motor vehicles.See e.g., § 522(f)(1)(B) and § 522(f)(4)(B). Prior to BAPCPA, the definition of household goods was broader so that more items could have been included, including more than one television, VCR, radio, etc. = Limits to the homestead exemption = Under the new law, the homestead exemption, which allows bankruptcy filers in some states to exempt the value of their homes from creditors, is limited in various ways. If a filer acquired their home less than 1,215 days (40 months) before filing, or if they have been convicted of security law violations or been found guilty of certain crimes, they may only exempt up to $125,000 (adjusted periodically), regardless of a state's exemption allowance.(§ 522(p)(1)). Filers must also wait 730 days before they are allowed to use their state's exemptions. (§ 522(b)(3)(A)). There is an exception if the property is \\"reasonably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor.\\" These provisions were largely intended to prevent filers from forum shopping, i.e. moving assets and domiciles to a state with more favorable exemptions and filing. = Exemptions = BAPCPA attempted to eliminate the perceived \\"forum shopping\\" by changing the rules on claiming exemptions. Exemptions define the amount of property debtors may protect from liquidation to pay creditors. Typically, every state has exemption laws that define the amount of property that can be protected from creditor collection action within the state. There is also a federal statute that defines exemptions in federal cases. In bankruptcy, Congress allowed states to opt out of the federal exemption scheme. Opt out states still controlled the amount of property that could be protected from creditors, or \\"exempted\\" from creditors, in bankruptcy cases. Under BAPCPA, a debtor who has moved from one state to another within two years of filing (730 days) the bankruptcy case must use exemptions from the place of the debtor's domicile for the majority of the 180-day time period preceding the two years (730 days) before the filing [§ 522(b)(3)]. If the new residency requirement would render the debtor ineligible for any exemption, then the debtor can choose the federal exemptions. Also, there is a \\"cap\\" placed upon the homestead exemption in situations where the debtor, within 1215 days (about 3 years and 4 months) preceding the bankruptcy case added value to a homestead. The provision provides that \\"any value in excess of $125,000\\" added to a homestead can not be exempted. The only exception is if the value was transferred from another homestead within the same state or if the homestead is the principal residence of a family farmer (§ 522(p)). This \\"cap\\" would apply in situations where a debtor has purchased a new homestead in a different state, or where the debtor has increased the value to his/her homestead (presumably through a remodeling or addition). = Additional requirements for filers = The new law adds a number of new requirements for bankruptcy filers that attempt to make the filing process more difficult and costly. These additional requirements include: *Additional filing requirements and fees. The new law increases the amount of paperwork involved in filing and raises the filing fees. The law also allows filing fees to be waived for debtors earning below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. *Increased attorney liability and costs. Attorneys representing bankruptcy filers are now required to conduct an investigation of their clients' filings and can be held personally liable for inaccuracies. Most bankruptcy attorneys predicted that this will result in increased attorneys fees and will make attorneys less likely to take on some cases. In addition, bankruptcy filings are now subject to audit in a manner similar to tax returns. *Increased compliance requirements for small businesses. The new law increases the bureaucratic compliance obligations and shortens the deadline for Chapter 11 reorganizations involving small businesses, a series of new requirements not applicable to larger businesses. *Increased amount of debt repayment under Chapter 13. The new law made several changes that effectively increased the amount of debt that Chapter 13 filers will have to repay. = Other changes = *The new law allows creditors to pursue collection remedies without court permission in various circumstances such as offsetting tax refunds, pursuing tax and domestic relations litigation in all respects except the final turnover of assets from the estate, establishing wage assignments in domestic relations actions, repossessing vehicles and personal property subject to loans or leases 45 days after the first meeting of creditors in cases where no court action has been taken regarding that property, and allowing evictions that completed the court process prior to the filing of the petition or involve endangerment to property or drug use to proceed. The law also makes it easier for creditors who received preferential payments of less than $5,000 from the debtor before bankruptcy to avoid repaying such payments for the benefit of all creditors. * The law improves the ability of the bankruptcy estate to reclaim assets placed in asset protection trusts within ten years of filing or paid as employment bonuses to insiders within two years prior to filing. * The law makes Chapter 12 bankruptcy (farm reorganization) permanent while adding family fishermen, overhauls the treatment of complex financial contracts including many derivative contracts used by hedge funds, and overhauls the treatment of ancillary foreign bankruptcy proceedings. * The law extends protection to non- ERISA pension plans like private sector 403(b)s and some Individual Retirement Account that ERISA plans had enjoyed thereby making these plans more similar to ERISA plans. * The law raises the priority status for payment of domestic support obligations (such as alimony and child support) from seventh place to first, only behind the administrative expenses of the trustee. This means that domestic support claimants get paid before all other unsecured creditors.  Legislative history  President George W. Bush signs into law the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act on April 20, 2005. The 2005 bankruptcy bill was actually first drafted in 1997 and first introduced in 1998. The United States House of Representatives approved a version titled the \\"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999\\" and the Senate approved a slightly different version in 2000.H.R.833.EH - Text of Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999 After the differences in the bills were reconciled, Congress passed the \\"Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000\\". President Clinton, however, employed what is known as a \\"pocket veto\\" by waiting for the lame duck congressional session to adjourn without signing the bill, a legislative maneuver tantamount to a veto.H.R.833.EAS - Text of Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2000\\"Clinton vetoes bankruptcy bill.\\" Associated Press, December 20, 2000. Retrieved on April 11, 2007. Professor Elizabeth Warren, a member of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission at that time, briefed First Lady Clinton on negative effects of the bill; according to Warren, after the briefing: In the years since 2000, the bill was introduced in each Congress, but was repeatedly shelved due to threats of a filibuster from its opponents and because of disagreements over various amendments, including one backed by Senate Democrats that would have made it harder for anti-abortion groups to discharge court fines related to legal debts incurred from lawsuits filed by pro-abortion groups. The increase in Republican majorities in the Senate and House after the 2004 elections breathed new life into the bill, which was introduced in its current form by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa.Full text of legislation S.256 According to George Packer in his book The Unwinding, Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, and Hillary Clinton helped pass this bill. (Of the three, however, only Biden voted for the final bill. Dodd voted against, and Clinton did not vote.) The bill was supported by President George W. Bush. Tom DeLay also championed the legislation. The bill passed by large margins, 302-126 in the HouseBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act - House roll call #108 and 74-25 in the Senate,On Passage of the Bill (S. 256 As Amended) - Senate roll call #44 and was signed into law by President Bush.  Support  Support for the act mostly came from banks, credit card companies, and other creditors.Harvey R. Miller, Chapter 11 in Transition - From Boom to Bust and Into the Future, 81 Am. Bankr. L.J. 375, 388 (2007) Since banks, credit companies and other creditors are the ones who must bear the losses for debts discharged through bankruptcy, their lobby power was a great supporting factor to eventually prevailing and getting Congress to pass the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. It was widely claimed by advocates of BAPCPA that its passage would reduce losses to creditors such as credit card companies, and that those creditors would then pass on the savings to other borrowers in the form of lower interest rates. These claims turned out to be false. After BAPCPA passed, although credit card company losses decreased, prices charged to customers increased, and credit card company profits soared.Michael Simkovic, \\"The Effect of BAPCPA on Credit Card Industry Profits and Prices\\" Berkeley Business Law Journal, Vol. 6, No. 1, Spring 2009  Criticisms  The 2005 bankruptcy bill was opposed by a wide variety of groups, including consumer advocates, legal scholars, retired bankruptcy judges, and the editorial pages of many national and regional newspapers. While criticisms of the bill were wide ranging, the central objections of its opponents focused on the bill's sponsors' contention that bankruptcy fraud was widespread, the strict means test that would force more debtors to file under Chapter 13 (under which a percentage of debts must be paid over a period of 3–5 years) as opposed to Chapter 7 (under which debts are paid only out of existing assets), the additional penalties and responsibilities the bill placed on debtors, and the bill's many provisions favorable to credit card companies. Opponents of the bill regularly pointed out that the credit card industry spent more than $100 million lobbying for the bill over the course of eight years.Egan, Timothy. \\" Newly Bankrupt Raking In Piles Of Credit Offers.\\" The New York Times, December 11, 2005. Retrieved on April 4, 2008. There has also been significant criticism of BAPCPA's changes to Chapter 11 business bankruptcies.Harvey R. Miller, Chapter 11 in Transition - From Boom to Bust and Into the Future, 81 Am. Bankr. L.J. 375, 387-88 (2007) Harvey Miller, one of the most-prominent bankruptcy attorneys in the country (particularly in terms of representing corporate debtors) has described BAPCPA as \\"ill-conceived.\\" One of the primary stated purposes of the bankruptcy bill was to cut down on abusive or fraudulent uses of the bankruptcy system. As Congressman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis), one of the bill's key supporters in the House, argued, \\"This bill will help restore responsibility and integrity to the bankruptcy system by cracking down on fraudulent, abusive, and opportunistic bankruptcy claims.\\"Day, Kathleen. \\"Bankruptcy bill passes; Bush expected to sign.\\" The Washington Post, April 15, 2005; Page E01. Retrieved on April 12, 2007. Opponents of the bill argued that claims of bankruptcy abuse and fraud were wildly overblown, and that the vast majority of bankruptcies were related to medical expenses and job losses. These arguments were bolstered by an in- depth study and survey of 1,771 bankruptcy cases by scholars at Harvard University, of whom 931 submitted to interviews. The study found that \\"about half\\" of bankruptcy filers in the year 2001 cited out-of-pocket medical bills in excess of $10,000 as a major contributor to bankruptcy (the average bankruptcy filer in this study was a 41-year-old woman with a median income of $25,000, slightly below the personal income average for that year).Himmelstein, David U., Elizabeth Warren, Deborah Thorne, and Steffie Woolhandler. \\"MarketWatch:Illness And Injury As Contributors To Bankruptcy.\\" Health Affairs, February 2, 2005. Retrieved on October 26, 2019. Perhaps the most controversial provisions of the bill was the strict means test it established to determine whether a debtor's filing under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code would be considered as an \\"abuse\\" and therefore subject to dismissal. This decision was previously made by a bankruptcy court judge, who would evaluate the particular circumstances that led to a bankruptcy. Critics of the means test, which is triggered if a debtor makes more than their state's median income, argued that it ignored the many causes of individual bankruptcies, including job loss, family illnesses, and predatory lending, and would force debtors seeking to challenge the test into costly litigation, driving them even further into debt.Sabatini, Patricia. \\"New law's 'means' test just mean, bankruptcy experts say.\\" Pittsburgh Post Gazette, April 26, 2005. Retrieved April 12, 2007. Besides the stricter means test, opponents of the bill also objected to the many other obstacles the bill creates for individuals seeking bankruptcy protection. These changes included more detailed reporting requirements, higher fees, mandated credit counseling, and the additional liability placed on bankruptcy attorneys, which critics argued would drive up attorneys' fees and decrease the number of lawyers willing to help consumers file. These criticisms were partly borne out in the months following the new law, as lawyers have reported that the bankruptcy process has become significantly more arduous, forcing them to charge higher fees and take fewer clients.Gertner, Reni. \\"Lawyers reflect on first six months of bankruptcy reform\\" . St. Louis Daily Record & St. Louis Countian, May 6, 2006. Retrieved on April 12, 2007. One criticism of the law was that the law made the discharge of liability for medical bills more difficult.See . A major target of the bill's opponents were provisions they described as beneficial to credit card companies. In particular, critics objected to the extension to eight years from six to the time before which debtors could liquidate their debts through bankruptcy, and requirements that those who file for multiple bankruptcies pay previous credit card debt that would have been forgiven under the old law. The bill's opponents were especially critical of provisions that expanded exemptions to the discharge of credit card debt, forcing spouses owed alimony to compete more often with credit card companies and other lenders for their unpaid child support. More broadly the bill's critics argued that the legislation did nothing to curtail what they characterize as predatory practices of credit card companies, such as exorbitant interest rates, rising and often hidden fees, and targeting minors and the recently bankrupt for new cards. The bill's critics argue that these practices are themselves significant contributors to the growth of consumer bankruptcies. Hurricane Katrina bankruptcies Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claimed: \\"If someone in Katrina is down and out, and has no possibility of being able to repay 40 percent or more of their debts, then the new bankruptcy law doesn't apply.\\"No Bankruptcy Relief for Katrina Victims\\", ConsumerAffairs.Com, September 15, 2005. Accessed April 4, 2008. The Justice Department's US Trustee program has since said it would not attempt to enforce the means test rules for disaster victims, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina. The Justice Department Trustees oversee the administration of bankruptcy law and are able to file the motions necessary to enforce the means test. Despite these assurances, bankruptcy judges are still able to enforce these rules sua sponte.See 11 U.S.C. 707. The Department of Justice also indicated it would not oppose a debtor's eligibility to file bankruptcy because the debtor did not fulfill the credit counseling requirements before filing. U.S. Trustees have the discretion to grant waivers of the credit counseling requirements to debtors. See . Global Financial Crisis of 2008 As the Financial Times noted during the fall of 2008, \\"the 2005 changes made clear that certain derivatives and financial transactions were exempt from provisions in the bankruptcy code that freeze a failed company's assets until a court decides how to apportion them among creditors.\\" This radically altered the historic process of paying off creditors and did so just a few years prior to trillions of dollars in assets going into liquidation as a consequence of bankruptcies following from the global financial crisis of 2008. Some observers have argued that this contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 by removing the incentive that creditors would normally have to keep a borrower out of bankruptcy. Institutions who provided short-term funding to financial firms such as Bear Stearns and Lehman through repo lending could abruptly withdraw that funding even if it risked pushing the firms into bankruptcy, because they did not have to worry about tying up their claims in bankruptcy court, due to the new safe harbor provisions of BAPCPA. On October 4, 2009, FDIC Chair Sheila Bair proposed imposing a haircut on secured lenders in the event of a bank default, in order to prevent this kind of short-term funding run on a troubled bank. \\"This would ensure that market participants always have some skin in the game, and it would be very strong medicine indeed,\\" Bair said.

It is based on the Australian national flag, with the field changed to Air Force blue, and the southern cross tilted clockwise to make room for the RAAF roundel inserted in the lower fly quarter. The roundel is a red leaping kangaroo on white within a dark blue ring. The ensign was proclaimed as a Flag of Australia under section 5 of the Flags Act on 6 May 1982. The southern cross is tilted so that Gamma Crucis stays in the same position as for the Australian National Flag and that Alpha Crucis is moved along the x-axis towards the hoist by one-sixth of the width of the flag. This results in the axis being rotated 14.036° clockwise around Gamma Crucis and each star is rotated in this way, although the constellation as a whole is not simply rotated. History RAAF airfield defence guards posing with the RAAF Ensign and the Australian national flag in AfghanistanThe RAAF was established in 1921. On 24 July 1922, the British Royal Air Force Ensign, a sky-blue British ensign with the RAF roundel in the fly, was approved as the ensign of the RAAF. This flag was used until 1948, when the RAAF asked to change the flag to avoid confusion. A warrant for the new flag, which had the roundel in the lower fly of sky-blue ensign with Commonwealth Star and tilted southern cross to match the Australian national flag, was given in 1949. The RAAF adopted a distinctive roundel on 2 July 1956; a red kangaroo replacing the red circle of the British version. The old roundel remained on the ensign, however, until 1981, when Elizabeth II as Queen of Australia approved the change to the current flag. Although the flag is only flown by the RAAF, dispensation was granted to New Lambton Public School, NSW on 18 May 1995 to fly the RAAF ensign. This was in recognition of the school's involvement with the RAAF during World War II, when it was requisitioned by the government and used as No. 2 Fighter Sector Headquarters. New Lambton Public School is currently the only school in Australia with permission to fly the RAAF ensign.

From the formation of the RAN until 1967, Australian warships used the British White Ensign as their ensign. However, this led to situations where Australian vessels were mistaken for British ships, and when Australia became involved in the Vietnam War, the RAN was effectively fighting under the flag of another, uninvolved nation. Proposals were made in 1965 for a unique Australian ensign, which was approved in 1966, and entered use in 1967. The Australian White Ensign is identical in design to the Australian National Flag, but with the reversal of the blue background and the white Commonwealth Star and Southern Cross. History Before Australia's Federation, the Colonial navies flew the British Blue Ensign, defaced with the symbol of the relevant colony. When operating outside colonial waters, these ships had to be commissioned into the Royal Navy, and consequently flew the British White Ensign.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 54 The British White Ensign was used as the ensign of the Royal Australian Navy from 1911 to 1967 During the early 1900s, several British dominions, including Australia, began to campaign for the right to create naval forces independent of the Royal Navy, and capable of deploying outside territorial waters. During the 1909 Imperial Conference, Canada and Australia campaigned for this, and suggested that these ships fly the British White Ensign, defaced with an emblem representing the dominion. No binding decision was made on the matter. During the lead up to the creation of the RAN, the issue was raised again: Australian politicians and the public wanted Australian ships to fly a unique ensign, while the British Admiralty wanted them to fly the British White Ensign.Foley, The Australian Flag, pp. 133–4 Suggested Australian ensigns included the British ensign defaced with a blue Commonwealth Star, or a variant of the Australian national flag.Foley, The Australian Flag, p. 134 Australian warships used the national flag as an ensign until the formal creation of the RAN from the Commonwealth Naval Forces on 10 July 1911: ships were ordered to fly the British ensign, while the Australian flag was used as a jack to identify their nationality.Frame, No Pleasure Cruise, p. 96 Australian warships regularly found themselves mistaken for their British counterparts.Kwan, Flag and Nation, p. 110 One attempt to alleviate this was made by the executive officer of during the Korean War, when he had a kangaroo-shaped 'weathervane' made and mounted to the destroyer's mainmast: this became the basis for the red kangaroo symbol fixed to the funnels or superstructure of major RAN vessels.Cassells, The Destroyers, pp. 11–12 The design of the national flag of Australia (top) was the basis of the Australian White Ensign (bottom) Australia's participation in the Vietnam War put the RAN in a difficult situation: the United Kingdom was not involved in the conflict, and RAN ships were effectively fighting under the flag of another, uninvolved nation.Cooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 204 During a Naval Estimates hearing in 1965, Victorian politician Samuel Benson voiced concern over the use of the British ensign by Australian ships on wartime deployments, and Don Chipp, Minister for the Navy, announced that an Australian ensign was under consideration. In 1966, Prime Minister Harold Holt added his support to the idea that a unique RAN ensign was required. The First Naval Member of the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board, Sir Alan McNicoll, proposed two designs to the board members: one retaining the St George's Cross from the old ensign but replacing the Union Flag in the canton with the Australian flag, the other retaining the Union Flag and replacing the Cross with the six stars from the Australian flag.Kwan, Flag and Nation, pp. 110–11 McNicoll was in favour of retaining the Union Flag, and in January 1966, the Naval Board recommended that the second design for the new ensign. The design was approved under section five of the Australian Flags Act 1953. Royal Assent was granted to the new flag by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 November 1966, and its creation was formally announced by Prime Minister Holt on 23 December 1966. The official changeover occurred on 1 March 1967, with all ships and establishments hoisting the new flag that day. The date was brought forward from 1 May 1967 to correspond with the commissioning of the chartered cargo ship , which became the first ship commissioned under the new ensign.Royal Australian Navy, Australian White EnsignCooper, in Stevens, The Royal Australian Navy, p. 205 However, the frigate was the first to use the ensign, when the ship's company unofficially flew the flag on 25 December 1966 as part of shipboard Christmas Day celebrations while deployed to the Far East Strategic Reserve. Only two RAN ships served in conflict under both the old and new ensigns: the aircraft carrier (later troopship) and the destroyer .Fairfax, Navy in Vietnam, p. 169 Design and use The Australian White Ensign has been used in the first quarter of the Australian Navy Cadet Ensign since 1972. The flag is white, with the Union Flag in the canton. A blue Commonwealth Star is located in the lower hoist. The Southern Cross constellation is depicted in the fly in the same manner as the national flag, but in blue instead of white. Regulations for the use of the Australian White Ensign are detailed in Australian Book of Reference (ABR) 1834 Volume III.

The winning design was based on the traditional British Red Ensign and featured the Southern Cross and Commonwealth Star. Devices The Australian red ensign is a predominantly red version of the Australian National Flag, using the same shade of red as the Cross of Saint George which is part of the Union Jack present in the canton. Maritime Ensign Following federation in 1901, the topic of national colours for British ships registered in Australian ports was addressed by the Navigation Act, which provided that such ships (i.e., civilian ships) should wear the Australian Red Ensign. Technically private non-registered vessels were liable to a substantial fine if they did not fly the British Red Ensign as they were not formally covered by the Navigation Act. However, an Admiralty Warrant was issued on 5 December 1938 which authorised such non-registered vessels to fly the Australian Red Ensign, too. Australia enacted fully domestic shipping legislation in 1981. The Shipping Registration Act of 1981 reaffirmed that the Australian Red Ensign was the proper \\"colours\\" for Australian registered ships and that smaller (i.e., less than 30 tons) pleasure and fishing craft could fly either the Australian Red Ensign or the Australian National Flag but not both at the same time. History From 1901 to 1924 the red ensign was used as the national flag by state and local governments. In the decades following federation the red ensign was also the preeminent flag in use by private citizens on land. This was largely due to the Commonwealth government and flag suppliers restricting sales of the blue ensign to the general public.Elizabeth Kwan, Flag and Nation, University of New South Wales press, 2006, p. 106. By traditional British understanding, the blue ensign was reserved for official government use although the red ensign was nevertheless still in military circulation until after the 1953 legislation, meaning the 1st and 2nd Australian Imperial Forces served under both the blue and red versions. State and local governments, private organisations and individuals were expected to use the red ensign.Kwan, 2006, p. 9-10. In the 1920s there was debate over whether the blue ensign was reserved for Commonwealth buildings only, culminating in a 1924 agreement that the Union Flag should take precedence as the National Flag and that state and local governments were henceforth able to use the blue ensign.Kwan, 2006, p. 100, 106. In 1940 the Victorian government passed legislation allowing schools to purchase blue ensigns.Kwan, 2006, p. 92. The following year prime minister Robert Menzies issued a media release recommending that the blue ensign be flown at schools, government buildings and by private citizens and continued use of the red ensign by merchant ships, providing it was done so respectfully.Kwan, 2006, p. 92. Prime Minister Ben Chifley issued a similar statement in 1947.Kwan, 2006, pp.96–97 =1901–1903 version= Australian/Commonwealth red ensign (1901–1903) After being submitted to King Edward VII for approval the competition winning design which featured a southern cross with nine, eight, seven, six and five points respectively was standardised by the British Admiralty with the number of points on the four biggest stars of the southern cross set to seven, ostensibly to improve ease of manufacture.

The squadron is based at NASJRB Fort Worth, Texas and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 41 (MAG-41), 4th Marine Aircraft Wing (4th MAW). Their tail code is MA. During World War II the squadron saw extensive action throughout the Pacific Theater of Operations especially at the Battle of Guadalcanal as part of the Cactus Air Force. By the end of the war, its 140 air-to-air kills ranked it third among Marine Corps squadrons. Mission Conduct of Air-to-Air and Air- to-Ground operations in support of the Marine rifleman. History =World War II= Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 112, was originally activated as VMF-112, at San Diego, California on March 1, 1942. Original VMF-112 Squadron Patch Deploying shortly after to Henderson Field on Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands in their Grumman F4F Wildcats, the Wolfpack joined the Cactus Air Force with Marine Aircraft Group 11. On 31 January 1943 Jefferson J. DeBlanc downed five enemy aircraft in a single mission, and was awarded the Medal of Honor for this action. In recognition of its valor and its contributions to victory during its service on Guadalcanal, VMF-112 was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (US) for August 7 – December 9, 1942. VMF-112 was withdrawn from Guadalcanal to Espiritu Santo for a respite. There it began to switch to the Vought F4U-1 Corsair, the aircraft that it would fly for the rest of World War II. VMF-112 returned to the United States on September 5, 1943 and took up duty at MCAS Miramar, outside of San Diego. It was there that VMF-112 was redesignated VMF(CVS)-112, denoting that the squadron was carrier qualified. center In December 1944, VMF-112 was assigned to Air Group 82 aboard USS Bennington for its second combat tour. In mid-May 1945, Lieutenant Robert Cook scored the only downing of a barrage balloon by a Marine squadron during the war when he shot one down over Kyūshū.DeChant Devilbirds, p.217. By the completion of World War II, the Wolfpack was credited with the destruction of 140 Japanese aircraft in aerial combat, ranking it third among Marine Corps squadrons in terms of enemy aircraft destroyed. Following the surrender of Japan VMF-112 returned to the United States where it was deactivated on September 10, 1945. =Post World War II= The squadron was reactivated on July 1, 1946 as the Marine Air Detachment, Marine Air Reserve Training Command, Naval Air Station Dallas Dallas, Texas. VMF-112 was reactivated with the Corsair, but eventually flew the Grumman F9F Panther and Vought F8U-1 Crusader. VMF(AW)-112 F-8H Crusader II at Dallas NAS in 1975 Iwo Jima When VMF-111 was deactivated, its aircraft passed to VMF-112, which became the Marines' largest reserve squadron. Upon receipt of the all-weather D/E model of the Crusader, the squadron was redesignated VMF(AW)-112 and flew several more versions of the F-8 until late 1975, when it switched to the McDonnell- Douglas F-4 Phantom II and was redesignated VMFA-112. On January 18, 1992, VMFA-112 retired the last active F-4S squadron in naval service (though some F-4 Phantom IIs remained in naval testing facilities after this). VMFA-112 flew the McDonnell-Douglas F/A-18A Hornet on their first official flight October 8, 1992. VMFA-112 moved to NAS Fort Worth Joint Reserve Base (JRB) in September 1996 and continues to operate there. =2000 & beyond= In 2002, VMFA-112’s aircraft were reconfigured to the F/A-18A+ aircraft. The Cowboys were the first Reserve squadron to deploy on a Western-Pacific exercise since the Korean War. In the summer of 2004, the squadron supported Operation Jungle Shield and Exercise Southern Frontier while operating out of Japan, Guam and Australia. In 2005, VMFA-112 deployed to Oerland Main Air Station, Norway, for the multinational exercise: Battle Griffin. The exercise was conducted to enhance cohesive operations between multinational forces and hone air-to- ground combat skills. The Marines experienced cold weather and harsh conditions during the exercise. Currently, VMFA-112 has been working closely with sister squadron VMGR-234 on what has been called the “Herc/Hornet Expeditionary Package.” The conceptual program would allow an F/A-18A+ to land on a hastily constructed runway and refuel and rearm quickly without having to return to base, as is the current operating procedure. The program would be in keeping with the Marine Corps nature of self-sufficiency. The squadron was deployed to Al Asad Air Base, Al Anbar Province, Iraq in late 2009. During their deployment, the Cowboys supported the ground withdrawal from the major cities in Iraq, supported special forces during numerous missions, and provided key aerial surveillance for intelligence. The squadron was the last fighter/attack squadron to leave Iraq closing that chapter on the Iraq War.  Squadron aces  * Archie Donahue – 14 kills * Jefferson J. DeBlanc – 9 kills * Robert B.

Fullam was named for Rear Admiral William Fullam (1855-1926). Fullam was launched 16 April 1942 by Boston Navy Yard; sponsored by Miss Mariana F. Welch, granddaughter of Rear Admiral William Fullam; and commissioned 2 March 1943, Commander H. C. Daniel in command. History Fullam served briefly as an east coast escort, then arrived at San Diego, California, 28 June 1943. After training in the Hawaiian Islands, she arrived at Efate, New Hebrides, 28 August for escort and patrol duties in the Solomons. From 1 November, when she covered the landings on Cape Torokina, Fullam guarded convoys carrying reinforcements and supplies to Bougainville as well as bombarding enemy installations in the Empress Augusta Bay area 25 January 1944. Four days later, at Vella Lavella, transports Fullam screened, embarked a mixed reconnaissance party of New Zealanders and American sailors, which was landed on the Green Islands, 30 January. The party was reembarked that night, and the landings in force by New Zealand troops on the Green Islands took place 15 February, as Fullam and her task force provided protective cover. Through the next 3 months, Fullam continued her patrol, escort, and bombardment missions in the Solomons, joining in the landings on Emirau 20 March 1944. After training and replenishment at Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons, and at Espiritu Santo, the destroyer joined the 5th Fleet for the assault on the Marianas. She arrived off Tinian 12 June for the bombardments on Tinian and Saipan which began the next day and continued until the landings of 15th. Ordered west to search for an enemy task force known to be moving into position to oppose the landings, Fullam rejoined the carrier task force 19 June as the Battle of the Philippine Sea opened. During this 2-day engagement, she joined in the general firing which combined with fighter actions brought down the vast majority of the Japanese naval aviation as an effective element in the war. Completing her assignment in the Marianas with duty screening the cruisers bombarding Guam as well as firing on targets there herself, Fullam departed the Marianas 10 August for Eniwetok. After training at Guadalcanal, Fullam sortied from Port Purvis 6 September 1944 for the assault on the Palau Islands. Six days out, she and Noa (APD-24) collided, Noa sinking in 6 hours, and Fullam being badly damaged. Despite this, Fullam not only rescued all of Noa's men, but also carried out daily shore bombardment and night harassing fire, as well as covering the work of underwater demolition teams, as Peleliu was assaulted, then sailed for temporary repairs at Manus and a west coast overhaul. Fullam returned to Pearl Harbor for training 24 December 1944, then sailed for picket duty off Pagan Island before reaching Saipan 15 February 1945. Here she joined a task group for the Iwo Jima assault, sailing 16 February to serve as screen and fire- support ship during the assault and the bitter fighting which followed until 28 February. After replenishing at Leyte, she sailed 27 March in the screen of an escort carrier group for the Okinawa operation. After providing air cover to the landings of 1 April, her group began continual strikes on the airfields on the Sakashima Clunto from which suicide flights were launched by the Japanese. On 4 May, while screening Sangamon (CVE-26) with another destroyer, Fullam fired on a group of four kamikazes attacking the carrier. The screening destroyers shot down three of the attackers, but the fourth crashed the escort carrier's flight deck, forcing many of her men over the side. Three were saved by the destroyers, who stood by as Sangamon extinguished the huge fire. From 13 May 1945, Fullam was assigned to antisubmarine patrol and antiaircraft fire support off Hagushi Beach, as well as antiaircraft fire support ship for fighter-director ships on radar picket stations away from the island. She sailed from Okinawa 1 July to escort landing craft to Guam, and an escort carrier from Guam to Eniwetok. Assigned to operate with carriers against northern Japan, Fullam cleared Eniwetok 11 August for Adak, but arriving after the close of hostilities, instead took up escort and patrol duties in the Aleutians until entering Puget Sound Naval Shipyard 13 November. In March 1946 she sailed south to San Diego, where she was placed out of commission in reserve 15 January 1947. Honors Fullam received seven battle stars for World War II service.

Known from 1866 as the Universalist General Convention, the name was changed to the Universalist Church of America in 1942. In 1961, it consolidated with the American Unitarian Association to form the Unitarian Universalist Association.Harvard Divinity School: Timeline of Significant Events in the Merger of the Unitarian and Universalist Churches During the 1900s The defining theology of Universalism is universal salvation; Universalists believe that the God of love would not create a person knowing that that person would be destined for eternal damnation. They concluded that all people must be destined for salvation. Some early Universalists, known as Restorationists and led by Paul Dean, believed that after death there is a period of reprobation in Hell preceding salvation.The A to Z of Unitarian Universalism, p. 397, Mark W. Harris, 2009: \\"RESTORATIONIST CONTROVERSY. An important confrontation within the Universalist ranks in the 1820s. During the early decades of the Universalist movement theological differences were largely ignored so that the movement could gain.\\" Other Universalists, notably Hosea Ballou, denied the existence of Hell entirely. History =Spiritual ancestry= Members of the Universalist Church of America claimed universalist beliefs among some early Christians such as Origen. Richard Bauckham in Universalism: a historical survey ascribes this to Platonist influence, and notes that belief in the final restoration of all souls seems to have been not uncommon in the East during the fourth and fifth centuries and was apparently taught by Gregory of Nyssa, though this is disputed by Greek Orthodox scholars.Richard Bauckham \\"Universalism a historical survey,\\" Themelios 4.2 (September 1978): 47-54. According to the Universalist historian Rev. George T. Knight, in the first five or six centuries of Christianity there were six known theological schools, of which four (Alexandria, Antioch, Caesarea, and Edessa) were universalist. The first verifiable and undisputed believer in universal salvation is Gerrard Winstanley, author of The Mysterie of God Concerning the Whole Creation, Mankinde (London, 1648). =Early America= The official seal of the Universalist General Convention American Universalism developed from the influence of various Pietist and Anabaptist movements in Europe, including Quakers, Moravians, Methodists, Lutherans, Schwenkfelders, Schwarzenau Brethren, and others. Pietists emphasized individual piety and zeal and, following Zinzendorf, a \\"religion of the heart.\\"A similar idea was developed by FDE Schleiermacher Early followers were most often German in ancestry. The majority of the early American Universalists lived in the Mid- Atlantic colonies, though Rhode Island also had a fair number of followers. Adams Streeter (1735–1786), the first minister of Universalist congregations in Oxford and Milford, Massachusetts, original societies of Universalism in New England, came from a Baptist background, ordained in 1774. Hosea Ballou has been called the \\"father of American Universalism,\\" along with John Murray, who founded the first Universalist church in America in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1774. One of the most important early Universalist evangelists was Dr. George de Benneville. Born in a Huguenot family exiled to England, he arrived in America in 1741. A physician and lay preacher, he spread Universalism among the German immigrants of Berks County, Pennsylvania, and later around Philadelphia and New Jersey. Benneville also commonly visited the Ephrata Cloister, a utopian community with Universalist beliefs. He arranged for the translation of a German book about universalism, The Everlasting Gospel (1753 translation),Georg Klein-Nicolai, under pseudonym of Georg Paul Siegvolck Das von Jesu Christo, dem Richter der Lebendigen und der Todten, aller Creatur zu predigen befohlene ewige Evangelium: von der durch ihn erfundenen ewigen Erlösung by Georg Klein-Nicolai of Friessdorf, Germany. Nearly forty years later, Elhanan Winchester read the book and converted to Universalism. He was influential in the printing of the Sauer Bible of Christoph Sauer (1695–1758), the first German Bible printed in America, with passages supporting Winchester's belief in the universal availability of salvation. In the South, Rev. Giles Chapmanborn June 21, 1748 in Newberry Dist., South Carolina, USA; died April 15, 1819 was a former Quaker and Continental Army Chaplain who married into a Dunker family. The first Universalist church in South Carolina (and possibly in America) was the Freedonia Meeting Hall situated in Newberry County.Universalist magazine, Volume 9 p48 ed. Hosea Ballou 1828 Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a convert to Winchester's teaching of universal salvation, but not a member of a Universalist church, was a vigorous foe of slavery, advocated the abolition of the death penalty, advocated for better education for women, supported free public schools, was a pioneer in the study and treatment of mental illness, and insisted that the insane had a right to be treated with respect. He published a pamphlet on the iniquity of the slave trade. As part of his abolitionism, he helped organize the \\"Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition of Slavery and the Relief of Free Negroes Unlawfully Held in Bondage,\\" the first antislavery society in America; he also served as its president. Rush believed, as did Winchester and most Universalists, in a state of punishment after death for the wicked. The first General Society was held in 1778. Annual conventions started in 1785 with the New England Convention. In 1804, this convention changed its name to \\"The General Convention of Universalists in the New England States and Others.\\" At its peak in the 1830s, the Universalist Church is reported to have been the 9th largest denomination in the United States. =Consolidation= The Church consolidated with the American Unitarian Association to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. Some state Universalist Conventions did not accept the consolidation. These churches and others form minor pockets of Christian theological Universalists which remain, but most are affiliated with other denominations.Christian Universalist Churches Church organization Universalist National Memorial Church in Washington, D.C. Universalist congregations tended towards independence and were not easily prone to centralization. They generally met in State Conventions, which usually had more authority than was vested in national Conventions. The church had three divinity schools: Theological School of St. Lawrence University (1856–1965), the Ryder Divinity School (c. 1885–1913) at Lombard College, and the Crane Theological School of Tufts University (1869–1968). The Philadelphia Convention was an independent National Convention from 1790 to about 1810. Notwithstanding its tendency toward independence, Universalist congregations supported the construction of The Universalist National Memorial Church in Washington, D.C., to serve as the official church of Universalism. In 1921, the Universalist General Convention approved funds for the building of the church and services began in 1925. The present church, located at 1810 Sixteenth Street NW, Washington DC, was established in 1930 and its current congregation continues to follow Universalist principles. Social and political stances The Universalist Church of America involved itself in several social causes, generally with a politically liberal bent. =Abolitionism= As noted above, Benjamin Rush was a major political activist for anti-slavery causes in early America. The issue resurfaced in the 1850s with the Fugitive Slave Act and other compromises; the Universalists, along with various other denominations, vigorously opposed slavery as immoral. They also favored postbellum legislation such as the Fifteenth Amendment and the Freedman's Act to enfranchise all American citizens. =Separation of church and state= Like many American religions, Universalism has generally been amenable to church-state separation. In New England, Baptists, Universalists, and Quakers provided some of the loudest voices calling for disestablishment of the government sponsored churches of the standing order. One example comes from the 1770s. By Massachusetts state law, citizens were taxed to support the Congregational Church of the community where they lived. Sixty-one people in Gloucester left the church to form the Independent Church of Christ, which stood for Universalism. They then refused to pay their taxes. The church they built was seized and sold to pay; however, the Church sued, and in 1786, they won their case. =Spiritualism= Although the Universalist Church as a denomination never fully embraced Spiritualism, many Universalists were sympathetic to this nineteenth-century movement. Spiritualism was preached with some regularity from Universalist pulpits in the middle decades of the 19th century and some ministers left the denomination when their Spiritualist leanings became too pronounced for their peers and congregations. =Ordination of women= On June 25, 1863, Olympia Brown became one of the first women in the United States to receive ordination in a national denomination, Antoinette Brown having been the first when she was ordained by the Congregational Churches in 1853. By 1920, there were 88 Universalist women ministers, the largest group in the United States. Universalists *Hosea Ballou, theologian and evangelist *P. T.

A winger, Armstrong made his Arsenal debut in 1962 at the age of 17 and went on to make 621 appearanceswhich was then an all-time club recordbefore he left Highbury in 1977. He spent a season each with Leicester City and Stockport County, and then took up coaching, both domestically and abroad. After a year as Kuwait national team manager, Armstrong returned to Arsenal as reserve-team coach in 1990, a post which he held for the remaining ten years of his life. Playing career Armstrong was born in Kipling Avenue, Hebburn, County Durham. After leaving school he took up an apprenticeship as an electrician, at Hawthorne Leslie and played works football with his older brothers. He had an unsuccessful trial with Grimsby Town, and was on the books of Newcastle United as an amateur. The Newcastle United coaching staff fell out with Armstrong following a mix up which resulted in Armstrong missing one game, consequentially as a result of the fall out, the stubborn Newcastle staff would rarely pick him. He signed for Arsenal early in the 1961–62 season. Armstrong arrived at Highbury as an inside forward but was soon switched to the wing. He made his senior debut while still only 17, against Blackpool on 24 February 1962 in a match that Arsenal won 1–0. Although he started out as understudy to Johnny MacLeod and Alan Skirton, by the 1963–64 season he had become a regular in the side, and in 1964–65 he missed only two matches. Select season required. Over time Armstrong became one of Arsenal's most consistent players, who was noted for the quality and accuracy of his crossing and corner kicks, as well as for his tireless running along the wing. He primarily played on the left, but was also effective on the right. Signed by George Swindin but maturing under Billy Wright's management, he was one of several players from the Wright era such as Jon Sammels and Peter Storey who became an integral part of successor Bertie Mee's Arsenal side. After losing two successive League Cup finals, in 1967–68 and 1968–69, Armstrong was instrumental in the Gunners winning the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, and was voted Arsenal's Player of the Year for 1970. He played in every match the following season as Arsenal completed the League and FA Cup double, and according to the club's website, \\"it was estimated that [he] had a hand in more than half of the goals scored in the Double season\\". These included Ray Kennedy's winning header in the last match of the season, against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane, that won Arsenal the League title. Armstrong remained with the club through the 1970s, as Arsenal failed to win any further trophies after their Double win; he played at least thirty matches in each season he was at the club during that decade. However, after falling out with Mee's successor, Terry Neill, he moved to Leicester City in September 1977 for £15,000. He played only 14 League matches in his single season with the Foxes, and finished his career in England with Stockport County. In 1980-81 he was the player-manager for Mjølner, Norway, playing his last match against Bodø/Glimt on 5 July 1981.https://www.nb.no/search?q=%22george%20armstrong%22&mediatype;=aviser&sort;=datedesc&fromDate;=19810705&toDate;=19810706 Player stats at Mjølner. Having spent fifteen full seasons at Arsenal, most of them as an ever-present, Armstrong set an all-time club record for appearances621 competitive first-team appearances, which included exactly 500 in the league; his record has since been overtaken only by David O'Leary and Tony Adams. He also scored 68 goals for Arsenal. His profile on the club's website suggests he was \\"one of the most accomplished players never to have won a full cap\\" for England, despite being capped at youth level and five times for the under-23 team; this was attributed to England manager Alf Ramsey's policy of not using wingers. Coaching career After retiring as a player, Armstrong moved into coaching, and worked for clubs including Fulham, Aston Villa, Middlesbrough and Queens Park Rangers. He managed Enderby Town and Norwegian club FK Mjølner, and managed the Kuwaiti national team between 1988 and 1989. In 1990, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, he returned to England, where he rejoined Arsenal as reserve team coach, a post which he retained for the rest of his life, despite the club's many managerial upheavals. During his time coaching at Arsenal Armstrong was responsible for bringing many young players through the ranks, including Steve Morrow, Ray Parlour and Paul Dickov. On 31 October 2000, Armstrong collapsed after a brain haemorrhage while taking a training session. He died in Hemel Hempstead Hospital during the early hours of the following morning. He was survived by his wife, Marjorie, and their two children, Jill and Tom. A pitch at Arsenal's London Colney training ground has been named in his memory.

Hanoi Rocks was a Finnish rock band that combined elements of punk, glam rock, rock and roll, and blues. Before his tenure in Hanoi Rocks, Suicide played guitar in a Finnish punk band called Briard in the late 1970s. Suicide replaced Andy McCoy in Briard after McCoy joined Pelle Miljoona Oy. After the breakup of Hanoi Rocks in 1985, he and his former bandmate Andy McCoy recorded an acoustic album under the name The Suicide Twins which was released in 1986 and was titled Silver Missiles and Nightingales. At the same time McCoy and Suicide started The Cherry Bombz, which included Timo Caltio on bass (later replaced by Dave Tregunna), Terry Chimes on drums and singer Anita Chellemah. The Cherry Bombz released two EPs: The Cherry Bombz (1985) and House Of Ecstasy (1986) as well as a live album, Coming Down Slow (1986). After The Cherry Bombz Nasty went on to form his own band Cheap and Nasty, which was active from 1990 to 1994.

In the episode, the alien time traveller the Ninth Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), having been joined by near-future genius Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley), land on Satellite 5 in the year 200,000. Satellite 5 is a space station that broadcasts news across the entire human empire. However, the Doctor notices that the station is suspicious: there are no aliens, and those who are promoted to Floor 500 seem to disappear. The Doctor and Rose discover that the Editor (Simon Pegg) and an alien are controlling the rest of humanity by way of the press. Meanwhile, Adam makes a mistake that forces the Doctor and Rose to take him home. The concept of \\"The Long Game\\" was originally submitted by Davies to the Doctor Who script office in the 1980s. Davies had also been interested in doing a storyline about a failed companion. In addition, critics have pointed out that the story is a satire on the media. Production for the episode took place in Newport in November and December 2004 and in Coryton, Cardiff in December. \\"The Long Game\\" was watched by 8.01 million viewers in the UK and received generally mixed reviews from critics. Plot The Ninth Doctor, Rose, and Adam arrive on Satellite 5, a space station orbiting Earth in the year 200,000. The Doctor gets Adam and Rose some credits to buy food while he looks around the station. The Doctor meets a woman named Cathica, a reporter who tells him that the station is a giant broadcast tower transmitting news across Earth. Cathica leads them to a room where she sits down in a chair located in the centre of a round table. The reporters are connected to the computer via a special port installed directly into the brain. The Doctor believes there is a malevolent purpose to the station that is holding back human development. He learns from Cathica that a select few are invited to Floor 500, which is believed to be the highest promotion that can be earned on the station. The Doctor, with Rose, hacks into the computer systems of the station and is detected by the Editor. The Editor allows the Doctor and Rose to travel to Floor 500, with Cathica following soon after. On Floor 500 the Doctor and Rose find the Editor directing control over the station through a number of dead humans. On the ceiling resides the Editor-in- Chief, the Jagrafess, to whom the Editor answers. The Doctor learns that the Jagrafess controls the lives of the people on the planet below by manipulating the news. Meanwhile, Adam discovers that he can gain access to information about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess learns about the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat, killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they have been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. The Doctor warns Adam that he cannot allow anyone to discover the information port and must live a quiet life from now on, but his mother accidentally activates it shortly after returning home. Production \\"The Long Game\\" features a guest appearance by Simon Pegg, who enjoyed playing the villain. In the book The Shooting Scripts, Russell T Davies claims that he had originally set out to write this episode from Adam's perspective, watching the adventure unfolding from his point of view (exactly as Rose did in \\"Rose\\") and seeing both the Doctor and Rose as enigmatic, frightening characters. He even gave this outline a working title: \\"Adam\\". Another working title for this story was \\"The Companion Who Couldn't\\". According to Davies, the concept of \\"The Long Game\\" was originally written in the early 1980s and submitted to the Doctor Who production office. Whether it was ever read by the production team of the time is unclear, as Davies received a rejection from the BBC Script Unit, who advised him to write more realistic television about \\"a man and his mortgage\\" instead. Davies reworked the story for the new series. In the DVD commentary for this episode, director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley refer to an additional motivation for Adam's actions. Apparently, in earlier drafts of the script, Adam's father suffered from a disease that was incurable in his time (2012) and he hoped to learn about a cure which had been discovered between that year and 200,000. In the shooting script, the condition is arthritis. No trace of this motivation remains in the finished programme, although Grant discusses it as if it were still present. Langley and Grant also reveal that the \\"frozen vomit\\" that Adam spits out in one scene was in fact a \\"kiwi and orange ice cube\\". Simon Pegg had grown up with Doctor Who and considered it a \\"great honour\\" to guest star. He was pleased at being cast as a bad guy. Pegg had previously played Don Chaney in the Eighth Doctor audio play Invaders from Mars. When the Editor announces the Jagrafess's name to the Doctor and Rose, he pronounces it as \\"The Mighty Jagrafress of the Holy Hadrajassic Maxaraddenfoe.\\" Pegg has stated during interviews that he found this an extremely difficult line to say. Voice artist Nicholas Briggs had recorded voice work for the Jagrafess, but his contribution was not used because it sounded too similar to the Nestene Consciousness (which Briggs had voiced in \\"Rose\\"). \\"The Long Game\\" was produced singularly in the series' fourth production block.Russell, p. 81 Filming in the studio took place at the Unit Q2 warehouse in Newport from 30 November to 3 December, on 7 December, and from 10 to 15 December 2004.Ainsworth, ed.

It was given a shark-like design, with the intention that it would \\"snap out\\" like a shark. The initial design was also described as a \\"lump of meat on the ceiling\\". Broadcast and reception \\"The Long Game\\" was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 7 May 2005. Overnight ratings showed that the episode had been watched by 7.51 million viewers live, a 38.9% audience share.

Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e May 02–08, 2005\\", listed under BBC1Russell, p. 139 The episode received an Audience Appreciation Index score of 81. \\"The Long Game\\" was released on DVD in Region 2 alongside the following episodes \\"Father's Day\\", \\"The Empty Child\\", and \\"The Doctor Dances\\" on 1 August 2005. It was then re-released as part of the first series boxset on 21 November 2005. The episode received generally mixed reviews. SFX described it as an \\"okay\\" episode that was reminiscent of the earlier episode \\"The End of the World.\\" Despite praising Pegg, the theme of \\"media control,\\" and the Jagrafess, they criticised it for \\"[failing] to capture the imagination\\" because there was \\"no real palpable sense of threat\\" and that human culture looked identical to modern day. Rupert Smith of The Guardian wrote, \\"Anything that satirises the profession of journalism is all right with me, but this did it with style.\\" Arnold T Blumburg of Now Playing gave \\"The Long Game\\" a grade of B-, describing it as \\"entertaining\\" and a welcome throwback to the classic series. However, he questioned the developing tradition of the Doctor not being the hero of the episode and noted that there were some dangling threads. Reviewing the episode in 2013, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times was more positive, writing that it \\"acts brilliantly as a satire of the media.\\" He also praised the guest cast and characters and Adam's departure. In 2011, Den of Geek's Mark Harrison wrote that \\"In retrospect, 'The Long Game' is an underrated and perfectly enjoyable mid-series episode,\\" praising Adam's departure. Reviewing \\"The Long Game\\" for The A.V. Club in 2013, Alasdair Wilkins gave it a grade of \\"B-\\". He found it \\"inessential\\" and commented that it was not very clear on the motives of the Editor and Jagrafess, but Pegg's performance was almost enough to make up for it. Overall he felt that the story \\"presents a few too many simple ideas, with the cumulative effect that this is a story that feels slight at best, underdeveloped at worst. The episode is hardly a failure, but it could have been so much more.\\" In Who Is the Doctor, a guide to the revived series, Graeme Burk described the episode as \\"entertaining, if unspectacular.\\"Burk and , pp. 33–34 He called Pegg the best guest star so far, and stated that Langley did a \\"superb job\\" at conveying Adam, but he felt that the episode did not have much else beside the failed companion storyline. Burk criticised the satire for not being subtle enough and borrowing from other stories such as Nineteen Eighty-Four. He also remarked that it was a shame Adam's motives were cut, as well as development between Rose and Adam. Burk's coauthor Robert [the \\"?\\" is part of his nom de plume] was more positive, opining that a satire did not have to be subtle to be effective, and that viewers could still relate it to the news media today.Burk and , pp. 34–35 He also praised the way \\"The Long Game\\" showed the Ninth Doctor as an \\"inspirational figure.\\" The two also questioned the decision to leave Adam in the 21st century with future technology.Burk and , p. 32 References =Bibliography=  External links Doctor Who Confidential — Episode 7: The Dark Side *\\"I'm the Editor.\\" — Episode trailer for \\"The Long Game\\" * Fiction set in 2012 Dystopian television episodes Ninth Doctor episodes 2005 British television episodes Television shows written by Russell T Davies Fiction set in the 11th millennium or beyond Television episodes set in space ","title":"The Long Game"},{"id":"1781954","text":"Redwoods shading the forest area of the garden.

Life He was born in London in 1923. He was the eldest son of Sir Oswald Mosley, 6th Baronet, a British politician, and his first wife, Lady Cynthia Mosley, a daughter of The 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (Viceroy of India and Foreign Secretary). In 1932 his father, Sir Oswald Mosley, founded the British Union of Fascists and became an open supporter of Benito Mussolini. In 1933, when he was only 9, Nicholas's mother, Lady Cynthia, died and in 1936 Diana Mitford, one of the Mitford sisters, who was already his father's mistress, became his stepmother. As a young boy, he began to stammer and attended weekly sessions with the speech therapist Lionel Logue to help him manage it. He later said that his father claimed never really to have noticed this stammer, but still, he may, as a result of it, have been less aggressive when speaking to him than towards other people. Mosley was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford. In 1940, his father was interned because of his campaigning against the war with Germany. The younger Mosley was still soon commissioned into the Rifle Brigade and saw active service in Italy, winning the Military Cross in 1945.London Gazette Issue 37027; published 10 April 1945 (pg. 7 of 10). In 1966, Mosley succeeded his aunt Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale, his mother's elder sister, as Baron Ravensdale, thus gaining a seat in the House of Lords. On the death of his father, on 3 December 1980, he also succeeded to the Mosley Baronetcy of Ancoats. In 1983, two years after his father's death, Lord Ravensdale published Beyond the Pale: Sir Oswald Mosley and Family 1933–1980 in which he proved to be a harsh critic of his father. He called into question his father's motives and even Oswald's understanding of politics. The book contributed to the Channel 4 television programme Mosley (1998), based on Oswald Mosley's life. At the end of the serial, Nicholas is portrayed meeting his father in prison to ask him about his national allegiance. Living in London, he was a half-brother of Max Mosley, former President of the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Marriages and children Mosley married twice and was the father of five children. On 14 November 1947 he married firstly Rosemary Laura Salmond (divorced 1974, died 1991), daughter of Sir John Maitland Salmond and the Hon.

History The Lally school, founded in 1963, is relatively new to RPI, which was founded in 1824. The Lally school was originally solely a management program for engineers. It was originally housed in the Jonsson Engineering Center and Lally Management Center, before finally being moved to the larger Pittsburgh Building. The management school was named after Rensselaer trustee Kenneth T. Lally and his wife, Thelma P. Lally. Kenneth T. Lally has been an important member of the Rensselaer community since 1970. The Lallys wanted the school to be known throughout the world as the \\"best of the breed\\". Lally, an entrepreneur who saved the historic W.& L.E Gurley Company (now Gurley Precision Instruments), knew the challenge of managing a technological venture. To help the management school gain national prominence, the Lallys gave $15 million, which was, up until 2001, the largest single gift in Rensselaer's history. To honor the benefactors and to more properly reflect the school's unique focus, the school became the Kenneth T. and Thelma P. Lally School of Management and Technology.

Centered in Rensselaer’s Lally School of Management & Technology, the Severino Center lies at the core of Lally’s commitment to Entrepreneurship, providing a broad-based platform for entrepreneurs to make the transition from concept to company. The mission of the SCTE is to expose every Rensselaer student to the practices and principles of entrepreneurship and to extend Rensselaer’s leadership and national prominence in technological entrepreneurship. The center implements this mission by: Providing and supporting opportunities to learn fundamental principles of entrepreneurship and study historical cases of successful entrepreneurs; Providing opportunities to listen to, interact with, and work with experienced entrepreneurs; Helping students with ideas for new innovations to find resources for commercializing their ideas, and helping students who are seeking businesses opportunities to find and initiate them; Guiding, mentoring and coaching student-based start-up businesses; Connecting students who are starting businesses to resources and networks within and beyond the Rensselaer community.

It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1989, and was nominated for both the Hugo and Locus Awards that same year. Overview It offers a view of an early 21st century world, apparently peaceful, with delocalised, networking corporations. The protagonist, swept up in events beyond her control, finds herself in places that are off the net, from a datahaven in Grenada, to a Singapore under terrorist attack, to the poorest and most disaster-struck part of Africa. In the story, the fictional book The Lawrence Doctrine and Postindustrial Insurgency, named after Lawrence of Arabia, is banned because it deals directly with methods and tactics of an insurgent rebellion. Plot summary The action takes place in 2023–2025 in Galveston, Texas; Atlanta, Georgia; Grenada, an island on the northeast coast of South America; Singapore; and Africa. Protagonist Laura Webster, mother of three-month-old Loretta, works as a public relations employee for Rizome, a global corporation of economic democrats. Together with her husband David they run the Lodge, a resort for Rizome workers on the island of Galveston. The action sets off when Rizome organizes a conference between itself and three data havens - EFT Commerzbank of Luxembourg, The Young Soo Chim Islamic Bank and Grenada United Bank - in the Lodge. After the first day of the conference Winston Stubbs, the Grenadan representative, is assassinated. The organization which admits to killing him calls itself \\"F.A.C.T.\\" (Free Army of Counter- Terrorism). Rizome decides to send Laura with her husband and baby to Grenada on a diplomatic mission to prove that Rizome had nothing to do with the murder. While in Grenada, Laura and David learn about its tragic history and the advanced technology flourishing on the island thanks to “mad-doctors” like the American Brian Prentis. Grenada is ruled by one party, the New Millennium Movement, with Prime Minister Eric Louison who uses voodoo tradition as a means of keeping order in the country. Food is plentiful and cheaply produced on one of the huge tankers adapted for factories and housing. Drugs, in the form of a pure synthetic THC, are also cheap and widely accessible. Laura and David manage to escape Grenada after Singapore attacks it. They return to Atlanta and separate. David takes the baby to one of Rizome’s Retreats and Laura sets off to Singapore to continue her mission to improve the world. In Singapore, Laura witnesses the launching of the first Singaporean space rocket, celebrated by a speech by Singapore’s prime minister and leader of the People’s Innovation Party, Kim Sue Lok. The celebration ends in chaos as the prime minister spits fire and explodes, a victim, as it turns out, of Grenada’s pseudo-voodoo tricks. This event triggers national panic and riots. Grenada invades Singapore in reaction to Singapore’s previous attack. In addition, Singapore’s opposition party Anti-Labour Party tries to use the situation to get into power. The last group to invade Singapore is the Red Cross. Ace Books 1989 paperback edition of Islands in the Net Cut off from the Net, Laura cannot contact her husband or Rizome’s headquarters. Together with other Rizome’s workers in Singapore, she decides to get herself arrested and wait in prison for the end of war. Unfortunately, Laura gets separated from her companions and ends up on the roof of The Young Soo Chim Islamic Bank. From there a chopper takes her and with other survivors of the riots to a cargo ship somewhere in mid-ocean. The ship is bombed by F.A.C.T., and Laura is taken to one of F.A.C.T.’s submarines, where she learns more about the organization. She is then taken by plane to a prison in Bamako, the capital of Mali; F.A.C.T. had taken over the Malian government to provide themselves a military base. After a conversation with the Inspector of Prisons, she finds out that she poses a threat to the organization because they think she knows they have an atomic bomb, which they keep on board of Thermopylae, the submarine she has been kept on. She spends two years in the prison. When a South African country supported by European authority of the Vienna convention attacks Mali, she is taken in a convoy to the atomic site to be shot on camera as a hostage. She is miraculously freed when the convoy is attacked by a group of Inadin Cultural Revolutionists. Their leader is Jonathan Gresham, an American journalist and radical, who helps Inadin people (also called Tuaregs, the nomadic tribes of the Sahara) fight against any forms of outside interference in their traditional way of life. Gresham takes Laura to an Azanian relief camp in order to save the life of her convoy companion, Azanian doctor Katje Selous, who was wounded in the action. Outside of the relief camp Gresham records Laura’s statement on all that happened to her and sends it on the Net. Laura and Gresham get romantically involved, but this feeling has no future as she has to go back to the States while Gresham will continue to help Inadins. Laura arrives at Galveston and takes part in an official Rizome party organized for her. Her husband David had lost hope that she was alive and gotten involved with Emily Donato, her closest friend, and Laura and David’s daughter Loretta is raised by Laura’s mother Margaret. Laura continues to work for Rizome and tries to improve the world by doing so. The last scene in the novel describes Hiroshima being bombed by F.A.C.T. Fortunately, this time the bomb did not explode. =Lawrence’s doctrine= In the fictional world of Islands there exists a book titled The Lawrence Doctrine and Postindustrial Insurgency by Colonel Jonathan Gresham. It is banned by Vienna and widely read in the political underground. It draws on the example of T. E. Lawrence, who during the First World War helped the Arabs, who were fighting the Ottoman Turks. Lawrence convinced them, instead, to block the Ottomans' expansion by destroying their communication lines, which at the time were railway tracks and telegraphs. Although the Arabs were successful in fighting the Turks, they became dependent on the British Empire to provide them with industrial products such as explosives and canned food. Gresham calls the First World War “a proto-Net civil war”. In Sterling's 21st century, the Tuaregs' enemy is the Net. But whereas the Arabs were colonized by the British with industrial products such as guns, cotton, dynamite, and canned food, for Sterling's Tuaregs the necessary products of the Networld are solar power, plastique, and single-cell protein. Gresham’s book shows a pessimistic view of globalization and its mechanisms. It takes the view that it is impossible for small and economically weaker nations to stay completely independent; global influence will always be present with its positive and negative aspects. =Political order of the world in Islands= In the world of the novel the USA and the Soviet Union are still the world powers. The international political order, which is guarded by the Vienna Convention and uses censorship as a means of keeping the world order, is weak and divided, and to avoid world panic protects the terrorists from F.A.C.T. Countries that grow in power are Grenada, Singapore and Luxemburg, the so-called data havens where data piracy is legitimate. Organizations that feel threatened by the growing influence of havens are Rizome Industries Group, an economic democracy global corporation which suffers losses because of the data piracy and wants to negotiate with the pirates, and the Free Army of Counter-Terrorism (F.A.C.T.) which calls itself “the real world police” and plans to deal with any signs of attacks on “doctrines of national sovereignty”. This is the main reason why F.A.C.T. assassinates Winston Stubbs and bombs the ship on which Laura was sailing with Singaporean pirates. The novel shows a new phenomenon emerging in the political world. The global organizations start realizing that they no longer need governments to successfully run their affairs; “Let us cut out the middleman,” says a worker for another corporation. The F.A.C.T. seems to be fighting signs of such thinking, while at the same time it is itself a global corporation which took over the government of Mali in order to have its own military base. Africa is still “a mess”. The only problem which has been solved is famine, thanks to \\"the scop\\", a single-cell protein. The countries still suffer from poverty and political instability. People die from retroviruses and have no perspectives, and developed countries are not interested in what is going on there.

They are the imine derivatives of amides (RC(O)NR2). The simplest amidine is formamidine, HC(=NH)NH2. Examples of amidines include: *DBU *diminazene *benzamidine *Pentamidine *Paranyline Preparation A common route to primary amidines is the Pinner reaction. Reaction of the nitrile with alcohol in the presence of acid gives an iminoether. Treatment of the resulting compound with ammonia then completes the conversion to the amidine. Instead of using a Bronsted acid, Lewis acids such as aluminium trichloride promote the direct amination of nitriles. They are also generated by amination of an imidoyl chloride. They are also prepared by the addition of organolithium reagents to diimines, followed by protonation or alkylation. Dimethylformamide acetal reacts with primary amines to give amidines: :Me2NC(H)(OMe)2 \\\\+ RNH2 → Me2NC(O)NHR + 2 MeOH Properties and applications Amidines are much more basic than amides and are among the strongest uncharged/unionizedRoche VF.

Protonation occurs at the sp2 hybridized nitrogen. This occurs because the positive charge can be delocalized onto both nitrogen atoms. The resulting cationic species is known as an amidinium ion and possesses identical C-N bond lengths. center Several drug or drug candidates feature amidine substituents. Examples include the antiprotozoal Imidocarb, the insecticide amitraz , the anthelmintic tribendimidine, and xylamidine, an antagonist at the 5HT2A receptor. Formamidinium (see below) may be reacted with a metal halide to form the light-absorbing semiconducting material in perovskite solar cells. Formamidinium (FA) cations or halides may partially or fully replace Methylammonium halides in forming perovskite absorber layers in photovoltaic devices. Nomenclature Formally, amindines are a class of oxoacids. The oxoacid from which an amidine is derived must be of the form RnE(=O)OH, where R is a substituent. The −OH group is replaced by an −NH2 group and the =O group is replaced by =NR, giving amidines the general structure RnE(=NR)NR2. When the parent oxoacid is a carboxylic acid, the resulting amidine is a carboxamidine or carboximidamide (IUPAC name). Carboxamidines are frequently referred to simply as amidines, as they are the most commonly encountered type of amidine in organic chemistry. Derivatives =Formamidinium cations= general structure of a formamidinium cation A notable subclass of amidinium ions are the formamidinium cations; which can be represented by the chemical formula . Deprotonation of these gives stable carbenes which can be represented by the chemical formula . =Amidinate salts= Structure of cyclopentadienyl dimethyl zirconium (diisopropyl acetamidinate). An amidinate salt has the general structure M+[RNRCNR]− and can be accessed by reaction of a carbodiimide with an organometallic compound such as methyl lithium.

Named in honour of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) of World War I, Anzac Parade joins Gallipoli Reach of Lake Burley Griffin in the south and the Australian War Memorial to the north. As the main axis between Parliament House and Mount Ainslie, it bisects Constitution Avenue, which forms one side of the Parliamentary Triangle between Civic and Russell Hill. The Parade is flanked by Victorian blue gum eucalyptus trees on gently sloping banks either side of the three-lane, one- way roads centred by a wide parade ground topped with granulated rock (similar to scoria), with planted boxes of a low bush called Hebe. The eucalypts are Australian; and the hebe comes from New Zealand. The Parade is also flanked by the streets of Anzac Park West and Anzac Park East on either side of Anzac Park. On Anzac Day (25 April) and other ceremonial occasions, the Parade and adjoining streets may be blocked off to provide a parade route for formed groups of armed services personnel and veterans to proceed either along the central parade ground or the flanking roads.

Situation and history Anzac Parade is situated on the main axis between Parliament House and Mount Ainslie. It bisects Constitution Avenue, which forms one side of the Parliamentary Triangle between Civic and Russell Hill. Land Axis The Parade separates the residential suburbs of Campbell and Reid. The naming is significant: *Robert Campbell, Sydney's first merchant, received a grant of land on the Limestone Plains as compensation for the loss of one of his ships on government charter. In 1825 he built a homestead, naming it Duntroon after the Campbell castle in Argyllshire, Scotland. Duntroon House is now part of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. *The Right Honourable Sir George Houstoun Reid (1845–1918) was Australia's fourth Prime Minister who formed a Government in August 1904 and held office until July 1905. A Federalist, and one of the founders of the Australian Constitution, he entered the Australian House of Representatives after having been Premier of New South Wales from 1894 to 1898. Anzac Parade in 1964 At the corner of Anzac Parade and Constitution Avenue is the historic St John the Baptist Anglican Church, consecrated by the Bishop of Australia, William Broughton, on 12 March 1845, some 80 years before the site of the national capital was decided. Fortuitously, the alignment of the church was such that it seems to have been designed to fit the alignment the adjoining roads, ordained in the plans by Walter Burley Griffin. Lighting The original lighting was designed to be a symbolic \\"honour guard\\" and was opened by then Prime Minister, Robert Menzies, on Anzac Day 25 April 1965. The street lighting was updated and officially opened on 26 March 2001 by then Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard. The design is intended to be efficient, and to reduce energy consumption and thus air pollution while also reducing skyglow/light pollution.

It includes the villages of Upton and Upton Heath. At the 2001 Census the population was recorded as 7,800, rising to 7,956 at the 2011 Census. History Formerly a township in Broxton Hundred, it included the hamlet of Upton Heath. The population was 173 in 1801, 555 in 1851, 1,769 in 1901 and 6,343 in 1951. An illustrated 300 page book on the history of Upton called 'Upton-by-Chester: A People's History' was published in 2005. Upton-by-Chester as we know it today started when the railway was built in the mid-1800s. Gentlemen's country houses were built and provided employment other than traditional rural jobs. Initially ribbon development but then housing estates were built as more people moved out of the overcrowded city. Following the post-WW2 building boom there is now little development land left. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of Dale Barracks in 1939. Upton Mill Religion Upton has four churches; one Baptist, one United Reformed Church, one Catholic (St Columba's), and the Anglican Church of the Holy Ascension. Landmarks One building of particular interest is Upton Mill. Built in 1775 this was a full working flour mill with outhouses, yard and orchard. The wind sails were removed in the early 1920s when electricity was installed. The mill became closed in 1953 and remained uninhabited until 1979 when the mill was sold and converted as a private residence. Renovation was completed in 1988. Education The area has four primary schools - Upton Heath (formerly Upton Manor), Westlea, Acresfield and Mill View - and a secondary school, Upton-by-Chester High School. Governance An electoral ward in the name of Upton exists. This ward had a population of 8,905 at the 2011 Census. Community The area has a hospital, a Royal British Legion Club, a bowling green, a golf course and a zoo, Chester Zoo. There is an active village hall, with a wide range of activities for all ages and interests. Transport =Rail= The nearest railway station is on the Wirral Line at Bache less than a mile from Upton village centre. Shopping and leisure The Wheatsheaf Inn There are several shops including Bache, Upton-Heath, Weston Grove, at least four pubs including the Race Horse, the Frog, the Mill@Upton and The Wheatsheaf Inn, an Indian Restaurant called Indian Brasserie, and a cafe called Russian Style Crepes. Upton-by-Chester Golf Club is an established, 18-hole parkland course. Notable people Labour Party former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott lived with his parents in Upton after moving from Yorkshire, and married his wife Pauline (nee Tilston) at Church of the Holy Ascension in 1961.

Occupying a area on the residential southside of Savannah, Georgia, United States, the school became one of three campuses of Georgia Southern University in 2018. The university's flagship campus is in Statesboro, west of Savannah. The Armstrong campus is located approximately fifteen minutes by car from downtown Savannah and from Tybee Island. Armstrong offers undergraduate and graduate degrees; it has a total student enrollment of approximately 5,000 students.https://em.georgiasouthern.edu/ir/wp- content/uploads/sites/5/GS_Fall2019FastFacts.pdf  History  Students of Armstrong College (circa 1950).The Armstrong campus was founded as Armstrong Junior College in 1935 by Mayor Thomas Gamble. Gamble pursued the issue during the height of the Great Depression to benefit Savannah's youth and the community, as well aid in stimulating the local economy. The college was originally located in the historic Armstrong House adjacent to Forsyth Park in downtown Savannah. The mansion was given to the city as a gift from the family of George F. Armstrong, a local businessman involved in the shipping industry. The college eventually grew to encompass six buildings in the Forsyth and Monterey Square areas of Savannah. In 1959, Armstrong College of Savannah became part of the University System of Georgia as a community college, and in 1964 the Board of Regents conferred four-year status on Armstrong State College. Donald Livingston and the Mills B. Lane Foundation provided the college 250 acres of land on the southwest side of Savannah. Eight buildings were constructed on the property and the college moved from the Armstrong House downtown to the suburban location in January 1966. Over the years the college expanded, adding new buildings and expanding academic programs. In 1993, the college began extensive landscaping work that transformed the campus into an arboretum. Armstrong College gained state university status in 1996 and changed its name to Armstrong Atlantic State University. The following year the university opened the Liberty Center in Hinesville. The university celebrated its 75th anniversary and inaugurated Dr. Linda M. Bleicken as its seventh president in 2010. In 2014 the school officially changed its name to Armstrong State University, to help minimize confusion regarding the school's location, make the name easier to say, and to create a stronger brand for the school. The name change became effective July 1, 2014. Armstrong celebrated its 80th anniversary and the 50th anniversary of the university's move to the Southside during the 2015-2016 academic year.http://www.wjcl.com/news/local- news/armstrong-state-begins-fall-classes/50840138/story Presently, the campus is no longer an independent institution with a separate accreditation. = Consolidation with Georgia Southern University = On January 11, 2017, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, on recommendation by Chancellor Steve Wrigley, voted to consolidate Armstrong State with Georgia Southern University. The merger, without any student-faculty input from the two schools, was to take place as part of a long-term goal of the Board of Regents to consolidate smaller, regional colleges and universities with larger, more well-known institutions. Under the consolidation plan, Armstrong State would inherit Georgia Southern's name, leadership, academics, and athletics, and the merged institution would become the fourth-largest public university in the state: the \\"New Georgia Southern University\\". Consolidation, which took a full year to implement, was officially proclaimed by the Board of Regents on January 17, 2018.  Campus  The Armstrong campus is located in a suburban setting near the Savannah Mall, with direct access to downtown Savannah via Abercorn Expressway. The landscaped campus includes subtropical ferns and flowers, southern magnolias, oak trees draped with Spanish moss, and a wide variety of native plants scattered throughout the arboretum-style grounds. Lane Library is the main academic and research library on the Armstrong campus. Lane Library's collection comprises more than 200,000 books and printed materials as well as 18,000 audiovisual works. The university recently invested $5 million in a renovation and expansion of the facility. The Science Center complex is a two-building complex connected by an enclosed glass walkway. The Science Center is home to many of the College of Science and Technology programs, including Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Physical Science, and Psychology. It includes classroom and lecture space, faculty offices, and labs. The facility opened in 2001 as the largest single increase in instructional space on campus since the campus opened. A , $24 million Student Union opened in 2010. It is the university's first green building, built with rapidly renewable and recycled materials and featuring a high-efficiency chilled water cooling system. The Union houses a 300-seat food court (formerly known as the Galley), 200-seat movie theatre, ballroom, bookstore, coffeehouse, convenience store, and expansive porches and lounges. Next to the Student Union is the Memorial College Center. Commonly known as the MCC, it houses Student Affairs and Student Activities offices. Armstrong's athletic facilities are located in the southeast area of campus. The Student Recreation and Aquatic Center is a athletic facility that includes a fitness center, and two basketball courts. The facility is home to the ROTC program and was the formerly home to the Armstrong Pirate volleyball team. The Alumni Arena is located adjacent to the Rec Center and includes an indoor running track, weight room, coaches offices, classroom space, and a 4,000-seat arena home to the men's and women's basketball teams. Since consolidation with Georgia Southern, the campus has not maintained a separate athletics program, with the future of these athletic facilities uncertain . Near the end of the 2017-2018 academic year, there were talks of renovating the campus's current athletic facilities to allow for the University's tennis and soccer teams to practice and play at the Armstrong Campus, in addition to creating new recreational and general purpose fields. Such a proposal, if approved, could take up to a decade to complete, with the entire project having a low-end cost of $40 million to upgrade the campus's current athletic facilities, including infrastructure needs as mandated by division standards. Windward Commons suite-style residential community opened in 2010 More than 1,400 students live on campus within four residential communities located in the southwest portion of the campus. Windward Commons is Armstrong's suite-style freshmen residential community which opened in 2010 and is home to nearly 600 students. It features private and semi-private suites, music practice rooms, multipurpose classrooms, lounges/social areas, laundry facilities, courtyards with outdoor sitting space and barbecue areas, and two classrooms. Compass Point, University Terrace, and University Crossings are apartment-style residence halls intended for upperclassmen and graduate students. On April 24, 2013, Armstrong completed renovations to the Memorial College Center, opening the Learning Commons. The space was developed as an extension to the Lane Library. Features include PC and Mac computers, three multi-touch tables, and group study rooms. Academics Armstrong features more than 100 academic programs and offers bachelor's degrees, master's degrees, and doctoral degrees through its College of Education, College of Health Professions, College of Liberal Arts, College of Science and Technology, and Graduate Studies programs. In addition, the school offers a Doctorate of Physical Therapy. The campus is classified as a Master’s college and university by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. For the 2010-11 academic year, Armstrong was not ranked and deemed a Tier 2 university by U.S. News & World Report. The university has full accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The university does not utilize graduate students to teach classes as all are taught by members of the Armstrong faculty. Armstrong has nearly 300 faculty members and a student-to-faculty ratio of 19:1. The university offers study abroad and honors programs and opportunities for undergraduates to participate in research across a variety of disciplines. = College of Education = Armstrong's College of Education offers degree programs via two primary departments: Childhood & Exceptional Student Education and Adolescent & Adult Education. The programs prepare graduates for the education field as well as other positions in education administration. In 2010 the college received continued accreditation through 2017 under performance-oriented standards of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE). = College of Health Professions = The College of Health Professionals is the largest academic college at Armstrong in terms of enrollment.

It confers degrees ranging from associate's through master's and doctoral. = College of Liberal Arts = Liberal arts have been the foundation of education at Armstrong since its founding. The College of Liberal Arts includes various departments and interdisciplinary programs that prepare graduates for careers in government, criminal justice, law, business, and entertainment. Students in the College of Liberal Arts study the arts, humanities, and social sciences in classroom environments and through internships, performances, exhibitions, undergraduate research projects, and study abroad programs. Departments include Art, Music and Theatre, Criminal Justice, Social & Political Science, Economics, History, Languages, Literature & Philosophy, Interdisciplinary Programs, and Military Science/ROTC. = College of Science and Technology = The College of Science and Technology at Armstrong has a strong emphasis on student research opportunities that prepare students for graduate programs. Areas of study in the College of Science and Technology includes: Biology, Chemistry & Physics, Computer Science & Information Technology, Biochemistry, Engineering, Mathematics, and Psychology. Liberty Campus = Liberty Campus= The Liberty Campus in Hinesville, which offers select academic programs to residents of Liberty County and surrounding areas, serves as the third campus of Georgia Southern, which operates under the Armstrong Campus. The Liberty Campus provides special services to Fort Stewart military personnel and their families. A variety of programs are offered or supported, including associate’s degrees in arts and applied sciences, and bachelor's degrees in criminal justice, nursing, early childhood education, middle grades education, and liberal studies, with plans to develop consortium programs with Savannah State University in the upcoming years. The Liberty Campus's current facilities opened in downtown Hinesville in January 2016.http://savannahceo.com/news/2015/05/armstrong-liberty-center- hinesville-offer-new-masters-degree-starting-fall/ Student life Armstrong offers many opportunities for students to participate in extracurricular programs, organizations, performances, forums, and athletics. The university has over 100 student organizations and an expanding Greek life system with nine fraternity and sorority organizations. The Student Government Association, Graduate Student Coordinating Council, and University Programming Board (formerly known as CUB, for Campus Union Board, prior to consolidation) offer many opportunities for involvement, leadership, and entertainment. The Inkwell is the university's student-run award-winning publication, published every Thursday during the semester. The university also sponsors a number of recreational intramural and club sports, including dance, flag football, tennis, rugby, ultimate Frisbee, baseball, bowling, basketball, and billiards. The Calliope was Armstrong's student literature and art magazine. It received a First Place/Special Merit award from the American Scholastic Press Association in 2010, but was retired following the consolidation. Celebrate Armstrong occurs in October and is planned by the University Programming Board (UPB). Celebrate Armstrong consists of different kinds of activities, entertainment, and competitions. The UPB also hosted the annual Big Show in the spring, a concert that has included performances from Gym Class Heroes, Maroon 5, and Migos. The campus offers numerous volunteering opportunities to give back to the local community. The campus started the Initiative for Civic Engagement in 2009, making community service an active part of the curriculum. Hundreds of students, faculty, staff, and alumni turn out for joint outreach projects or the biannual Treasure Savannah Day of Service. = Student Government Association = The Student Government Association (SGA) for the Armstrong Campus consists of an executive and a legislative branch. The first student association on the campus was the Armstrong Student Association, founded by Armstrong Junior College's inaugural class in 1935. SGA's current system has existed since the summer of 2018, when the constitution for the post-consolidation Georgia Southern University took effect. In addition to the university-wide SGA President, the executive branch consists of an Executive Vice President, who chairs the Campus Executive Board for the Armstrong Campus, which includes the Executive Vice President, the Chief of Staff, other vice president positions with their own specialty (e.g. for financial or academic affairs), and officers. The Campus Executive Board consists of elected and appointed officers and serves as an advisory body for the campus's University administrators. The legislative branch consists of a Senate, lead by a Speaker, who presides over meetings of the Senate. The Senate consists of Senators representing the colleges housed on the Armstrong Campus (currently, the Colleges of Education, Health Professions, and Public Health), as well as two additional \\"colleges\\": Graduate Studies and At-Large, to ensure that graduate students and students whose major is not housed on the Armstrong Campus, respectively, are still represented. In addition to presiding over the Senate, the Speaker also chairs the Senate Advisory Council, which consists of the Speaker and other officers of the Senate Leadership, such as the Deputy Speaker, Senate Whip, Parliamentarian, and the chairs for the Senate's various standing committees. The Liberty Campus is represented by the Armstrong Campus, and includes a semi-autonomous Governing Board, led by an elected Director, and a Student Council, led by the Assistant Director.  Pirate athletics (1935–2017)  Armstrong State University's consolidation with Georgia Southern spelled an end for Armstrong's athletics, being announced on March 7, 2017 that Armstrong's athletic program would be discontinued at the conclusion of the 2016–17 academic year. Armstrong's athletic teams were known as the Pirates. Armstrong competed at the NCAA Division II level as a charter member of the Peach Belt Conference (PBC). Armstrong fielded twelve intercollegiate sports, five men's and seven women's: Men's sports * Baseball * Basketball * Cross country * Golf * Tennis Women's sports * Basketball * Cross country * Golf * Soccer * Softball * Tennis * Volleyball Athletics at Armstrong began at the start of the school's history in the 1930s with its teams known as the Geechees. The school won state championships as a junior college in 1938 in men's basketball and men's tennis. Athletics were suspended during World War II. Following the war, the college added new athletic programs, and in 1948 men's basketball won a second state championship. Armstrong joined the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) in 1967 and became known as the Pirates after the college became a four-year institution. In 1973, it joined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and became a member of the South Atlantic Conference (SAC) with in- state rivals Valdosta State College, Columbus College, and Augusta College. In 1983, Armstrong State College upgraded athletics to NCAA Division I and became a charter member of the Big South Conference in 1985. Soon after, in 1987, the Pirates returned to Division II, becoming a charter member of the Peach Belt Conference in 1990. Armstrong holds 96 PBC championships. In addition, the university has appeared in 139 NCAA Championships, winning 13 titles. Armstrong has produced 296 All-Americans. The Armstrong men's and women's tennis teams have combined to capture 10 NCAA Division II national championships over the last nine seasons.

The conference coordinates the maintenance of 2,000 miles of foot trails around the New York metropolitan area, from the Delaware Water Gap, north to beyond the Catskill Mountains, including the Appalachian Trail through New York and New Jersey. It also works to protect open space and publishes books and trail maps. The organization's headquarters are at 600 Ramapo Valley Road, Mahwah, New Jersey. History On October 19, 1920 local hiking clubs gathered in the Log Cabin atop the Abercrombie & Fitch sporting goods store in New York City. The meeting was proposed by Meade C. Dobson of the Boy Scouts of America and organized by Major William A. Welch, general manager of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission to plan a system of hiking trails to make Harriman-Bear Mountain State Park more accessible to the public. In addition to Welch and Dobson, those attending included Raymond H. Torrey, who edited the Outings page of the New York Evening Post, and included representatives from the Appalachian Mountain Club, the Fresh Air Club, the Green Mountain Club, the Tramp and Trail Club, the Associated Mountaineering Clubs of America and the League of Walkers. Major Welch guided the organization during its first ten years. Raymond Torrey served as its Secretary. In 1922 a proposal by forester Benton MacKaye to build a trail from Maine to Georgia (subsequently named the Appalachian Trail) was publicized by the New York Evening Post. The project generated great enthusiasm, and on October 7, 1923, the first section of the trail, from Bear Mountain west through Harriman State Park to Arden, New York, was opened by groups of enthusiastic volunteers. The first trails built were the Ramapo-Dunderberg, the Timp-Torne, the Tuxedo-Mount Ivy Trails, and the Boy Scouts' White Bar Trail; all are still in use. In 1923, the Palisades Interstate Trail Conference changed its name to the New York New Jersey Trail Conference. During the 1930s, as more trails were built, a system of trail maintenance was developed giving each hiking club a share of responsibility. Over the ensuing years, as the number of miles of trails maintained has grown, the Trail Conference has relied on trained individual volunteers as well to maintain the trails. They also have developed skilled volunteer trail crews to repair and build trails. Land acquisition and preservation On May 31, 2011 the Times Herald-Record reported by Stephen Sacco that the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference had helped expand the Huckleberry Ridge State Forest in Orange County, New York by transferring 389 acres from the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference holdings to the State of New York. The Huckleberry Ridge State Forest grew to 1500 acres with the acres purchased from the Trail Conference. The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation paid $1.55 million for the land purchase from the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference, the Times Herald-Record reports. Stephen Sacco goes on to report that throughout New York and New Jersey, the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference has managed to preserve 2400 acres through direct land purchases in the past 10 years. Protecting the 43 mile long Shawangunk Ridge Trail has been a priority for the New York - New Jersey Trail Conference and other conservation groups including Open Space Institute, The Nature Conservancy, and the Orange County Land Trust was also reported by the Times Herald-Record. The Trail Conference has been active in open space preservation in its region since its earliest days, including the efforts that led to the preservation of Storm King Mountain, now Storm King State Park. In that project, the Trail Conference joined with The Nature Conservancy to found the Scenic Hudson Preservation Committee, which eventually became known and established as Scenic Hudson, and which continues to protect land today. The Trail Conference also led the effort to preserve Sterling Forest in New York and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area on the border of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

The aim of the game is to keep the hoop upright for long periods of time, or to do various tricks. Hoop rolling has been documented since antiquity in Africa, Asia and Europe. Played as a target game, it is an ancient tradition widely dispersed among different societies. In Asia, the earliest records date from Ancient China, and in Europe from Ancient Greece. In the West, the most common materials for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, driven with a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre of the stick in order to ensure good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook. History A version of hoop rolling played as a target game is encountered as an ancient tradition among aboriginal peoples in many parts of the world. The game, known as hoop- and-pole, is ubiquitous throughout most of Africa. It is also found on other continents. In the Americas, where it has been played by a great number of unrelated tribes and is known in English as hoop-and-stick or hoop-and-dart, the game has exhibited many variations of materials and size of implements and rules of play.Andrew McFarland Davis Indian Games. pp. 44–56. . It is postulated that its wide distribution is a factor of the rich symbolical possibilities of the game, rather than indicating radial diffusion from a single center of invention. =Ancient Greece= A Greek youth depicted playing with a hoop The Greeks referred to the hoop as the \\"trochus\\". Hoop rolling was practiced in the gymnasium, and the prop was also used for tumbling and dance with different techniques.William Smith (1859) A dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities. Little, Brown, and Co. p. 1020 Although a popular form of recreation, hoop rolling was not featured in competition at the major sports festivals. Hoops, also called krikoi, were probably made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were driven with a stick called the \\"elater\\".Edward M Plummer (1856) Athletics and Games of the Ancient Greeks. Cambridge, Mass., Lombard & Caustic, Printers. p. 50 The hoop was sized according to the player, as it had to come up to the level of the chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick. The sport was regarded as healthful, and was recommended by Hippocrates for strengthening weak constitutions.\\"Hippocrates recommended playing with a hoop as a cure for weak people\\" Even very young children would play with hoops.James Augustus St. John (1878) The history of the manners and customs of ancient Greece. Volume 1. London, J. Murray. p. 148 The hoop thus held symbolic meanings in Greek myth and culture. A bronze hoop was one of the toys of the infant Dionysus,Francis Legge (1915) Forerunners and Rivals of Christianity: Being Studies in Religious History from 330 B.C. to 330 A.D.. The University Press. p. 125 and hoop driving is an attribute of Ganymede, often depicted on Greek vase paintings from the 5th century BCE. Images of the hoop are sometimes presented in the context of ancient Greek pederastic tradition. =Ancient Rome and Byzantium= A boy playing with hoops, depicted in the 6th-century mosaics of the Great Palace of Constantinople The Romans learned hoop driving from the Greeks and generally held the sport in high regard.Karl Groos (1901) \\"Playful Use of the Motor Apparatus.\\" Chapter 2 in The Play of Man, translated by Elizabeth L. Baldwin. New York: Appleton: pp. 74–121. \\"Other rolling toys, such as wheels and hoops, whose motion is kept up by means of continuous striking, offer a very different kind of amusement. The violent running, combining as it does something of the zest of the chase with the pleasure of overcoming a difficulty, forms a delightful compound with the enjoyment of the rolling as such. The Greeks called the hoop trocoVor krikoV. They were rather large, and made of metal studded with tinkling bells and propelled by a metal rod. Ganymede is often represented with such a hoop. The Romans had an extraordinary fondness for this sport, and Ovid, who refers to a teacher of the art of hoop rolling, says in one of his enumerations of the spring games \\"Usus equi nunc est, levibus nunc luditur armis, Nunc pila, nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus.\\" Fouquières cites a passage from Martial about youths rolling hoops on frozen streams. The Latin term for hoop is also \\"trochus\\", at times referred to as the \\"Greek hoop.\\" The stick was known as a \\"clavis\\" Thomas Dudley Fosbroke (1843) Encyclopædia of antiquities: and elements of archaeology .... Vol. 2. N3. London : M. A. Nattali. p. 619 or \\"radius\\", had the shape of a key, and was made of metal with a wooden handle. Roman hoops were fitted with metal rings that slid freely along the rim. According to Martial, this was done so that the tinkling of the rings would warn passers by of the hoop's approach: \\"Why do these jingling rings move about upon the rolling wheel? In order that the passers-by may get out of the way of the hoop.\\"(14. CLXIX) He also indicates that the metal tires of wooden cart wheels could be used as hoops: \\"A wheel must be protected. You make me a useful present. It will be a hoop to children, but to me a tyre for my wheel.\\"(14. CLXVIII)Harris, pp. 136–137 Martial also mentions the sport was practised by Sarmatian boys, who rolled their hoops on the frozen Danube river. According to Strabo, one of the popular Roman venues for practising the sport was the Campus Martius, which was large enough to accommodate a wide variety of activities. The Roman game was to roll the hoop while throwing a spear or stick through it. For Romans, this was more an entertainment and military development, not a philosophical activity. Several ancient sources praise the sport. According to Horace, hoop driving was one of the manly sports.William Pulleyn (1830) The etymological compendium, or, Portfolio of origins and inventions. T. Tegg. p. 139 Ovid in his Tristia is more specific, putting the sport in the same category with horsemanship, javelin throwing and weapon practice: \\"Usus equi nunc est, levibus nunc luditur armis, Nunc pila, nunc celeri volvitur orbe trochus.\\"Harris, p. 135 It was also presented as a virtue in the Distichs of Cato, which enjoin youth to \\"Trocho lude; aleam fuge\\" (\\"Play with the hoop, flee the dice\\").Harris, p. 136 A 2nd-century medical text by Antyllus, preserved in an anthology of Oribasius, Emperor Julian's physician, describes hoop rolling as a form of physical and mental therapy. Antyllus indicates that at first the player should roll the hoop maintaining an upright posture, but after warming up he can begin to jump and run through the hoop. Such exercises, he holds, are best done before a meal or a bath, as with any physical exercise.Harris, pp. 133 ff. Modern usage Children rolling hoops, Holland, 1560 Afonso, Prince Imperial of Brazil holding a stick and hoop, 1846 Early 19th-century travellers saw children playing with hoops over much of Europe and beyond.François-René de Chateaubriand (1838) Voyage en Amérique.

Christian missionaries encountered it there in the 19th century.\\"They also delight in rolling the hoop\\", p. 69 in The Gospel in all lands. Children in late Edo period Japan also were known to play the game.Sir Rutherford Alcock (1863) The capital of the tycoon: a narrative of a three years' residence in Japan. New York: Bradley Co. p. 281 In English the sport is known by several names, \\"hoop and stick\\", \\"bowling hoops\\", or \\"gird and cleek\\" in Scotland, where the gird is the hoop and the cleek, the stick. In the west, around the end of the 19th century, the game was played by boys up to about twelve years of age.Cassell's Complete Book of Sports and Pastimes (1896). Cassell. p. 237. Hoops would at times have pairs of tin squares nailed to the inside of the circle, to jingle as the hoop was rolled.William Clarke (1829) The Boy's Own Book: A Complete Encyclopedia of All the Diversions Athletic. Vizetelly, Branston and Co. p. 28 Up to a dozen such pairs of rattles might be placed around the rim of the hoop. Some preferred the ashen hoops, round on the outside and flat on the inside, to the ones made of iron, as the latter could break windows and hurt the legs of the passers by and horses. =Games= Among the games played with the hoops—besides simply trundling them, which is a matter of driving them forward while keeping them upright—are hoop races, as well as games of dexterity. Among these are \\"toll,\\" in which the player has to drive his hoop between two stones placed two to three inches apart without touching either one.The Corner cupboard, by the ed. of \\"Enquire within Upon Everything\\". p. 56 Another such game is \\"turnpike\\", in which one player drives the hoop between pairs of objects, such as bricks, at first placed so that the opening is about a foot wide, with each gate kept by a different player. After running all the gates, the openings are made smaller by one inch, and the player trundling the hoop runs the course again. The process repeats until he strikes the side of a gate, then he and the turnpike keeper switch places. Conflict games such as \\"hoop battle\\" or \\"tournament\\" can also be played. For this game, boys organise into opposing teams that drive their hoops against each other with the aim of knocking down as many of the opponents' hoops as possible. Only those hoops which fall as a result of a strike by another hoop are counted out.John Kendrick (1852) Every boy's book of games, sports, and diversions, or The school-boy's manual of amusement, instruction and health. London: Grieves. p. 18. In some parts of England, boys played a similar game called \\"encounters,\\" where two boys would drive their hoops against each other, with the one whose hoop was left standing being declared the winner. Boy playing Hoop rolling in DRC The \\"hoop hunt\\" is yet another game, in which one or more hoops are allowed to roll down a hill, with the double aim of rolling as far as possible and then of locating the hoop wherever it may have ended up.William Chambers, Robert Chambers (1864) Chamber's Journal of Popular Literature, Science, and Arts. p. 503 =British Empire= In England, children are known to have played the game as early as the 15th century.The Pictorial History of England vol. 2, by George Lillie Craik, Charles Knight, Charles MacFarlane, Harriet Martineau; p. 263 By the late 18th century, boys driving hoops in the London streets had become a nuisance, according to Joseph Strutt. Throughout the 1840s, a barrage of denunciations appeared in the papers against \\"The Hoop Nuisance,\\" in which their iron hoops were blamed for inflicting severe injuries to pedestrians' shins The London police attempted to eradicate the practice, confiscating the iron hoops of boys and girls trundling them through the streets and parks. That campaign, however, seems to have failed, as it was accompanied by renewed complaints about the increase of the nuisance. Other writers mocked the complainers as grumblers depriving the \\"juvenile community\\" of a healthy and harmless pastime that had been practised for hundreds of years \\"without any apparent inconvenience to the public at large.\\" The passion for passing laws was ridiculed: \\"Enact, say our modern philosophers, enact. Pass statute after statute. Regulate with exquisite minuteness the cries of the baby in the cradle, the laughter of the hoop-trundling boy, the murmurrings of the toothless old man.\\" In the 1860s, the anti-trundling campaign was taken up by Charles Babbage, who blamed the boys for driving iron hoops under horses' legs, with the result that the rider is thrown and very often the horse breaks a leg.Charles Babbage (1864) Passages from the life of a philosopher. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press; Piscataway, N.J. : IEEE Press. p. 360 Babbage achieved a certain notoriety in this matter, being denounced in debate in Commons in 1864 for \\"commencing a crusade against the popular game of tip-cat and the trundling of hoops.\\"Hansard's parliamentary debates.

Parliament, Thomas Curson Hansard \\"Street Music (Metropolis) Bill\\"; V4, p. 471 Girl with a Hoop (1885) by Pierre-Auguste Renoir The fuss over boys playing with hoops reached halfway around the globe. In the Colony of Tasmania, boys trundling hoops were blamed for endangering horsemen and rending ladies' dresses, and the Hobart paper called for their banishment to the suburbs, bye- laws, and police attention.\\"The Hoop Nuisance-The practice pursued by boys in trundling their hoops on the streets and footpaths has become a dangerous nuisance. The other day a gentleman was riding a rather spirited horse in Macquarie-street when a careless urchin drove his hoop against the animal's legs, when it instantly reared and plunged, and would have thrown its rider had not his good horsemanship enabled him to keep his seat, and, eventually, to quiet the frightened horse. On another occasion an elderly lady was crossing Davey-street, where three boys were vigorously racing with their hoops, one of which came in contact with the lady's silk dress, and damaged it by a considerable rent. We are not averse to boyish games or amusements, and as there are numerous quiet localities in the suburbs, but little frequented by passengers, either on horse or foot, the boys ought to be compelled to quiet the public thoroughfares, and to resort to places where no injury could arise from the pursuit of their pastimes. The Corporation could effect this by a bye-law, and tin Police ought to receive strict directions rigidly to enforce it.\\" The Hobart Town Daily Mercury. 18 August 1858. p. 3 Not only schoolboys, but even graduate students at Cambridge enjoyed trundling hoops after their lectures. The practice, however, was brought to an end sometime before 1816, by means of a statute that forbade Masters of Arts to roll hoops or play marbles. By the early 19th century, the game was already part of the standard physical education of girls, together with jumping rope and dumbbells.George Ripley (1858) New American Cyclopedia, Vol. 8. p. 609 Girls from four to fourteen could be seen by the hundreds, trundling their hoops across the grass in the London parks. Though held to be common in the early years of the 19th century, the simplicity and innocence of those years was alleged to have been replaced by the 1850s with a precocious maturity, where \\"Instead of trundling hoops, urchins smoke cigars.\\" In the mid-19th century, bent ash was favoured as material for making wooden hoops. In early 20th- century England, girls played with a wooden hoop driven with a wooden stick, while boys' hoops were made of metal and the sticks were key-shaped and also made of metal. In some locations, hoops with spokes and bells were available in stores, but they were often disdained by boys . Another alternate name for hoop rolling is Gird ‘N Cleek. The World Gird ‘N Cleek championships are held annually in New Galloway, Scotland. Winners include Andrew Firth (1983), Alexander McKenna (2009,2018), Arthur Harfield (2019). . =America= A great number of widely separated Native American peoples play or played an ancient target-shooting version of hoop rolling currently known as Chunkey. Though the forms of the game exhibited great variation, generally certain elements were present, namely a prepared terrain over which a disc or hoop was rolled at high speed, at which implements similar to spears were thrown. The game, when played by adults, was often associated with gambling; and quite often, very valuable prizes, such as horses, exchanged hands.Charles Augustus Murray (1839) Travels in North America: including a summer residence with the ... Vol. 2. London, R. Bentley. p. 19 The game has been played by tribes such as the Arapaho, the Omaha, the Pawnee and many others. Since hoop and stick involves spear throwing, it is thought to predate the introduction of the bow and arrow that took place around 500 AD. In the California region in the 18th century, it was widespread and known as \\"takersia\\". Canadian Inuit players divide into two groups. While the first group rolls the hoops—a large and a small one—the players in the other group attempt to throw spears through the hoops. The Cheyenne named two months of the year after the game: January is known as Ok sey' e shi his, \\"Hoop-and-stick game moon,\\" and February as Mak ok sey' i shi, \\"Big hoop-and-stick game moon.\\" Among the Blackfeet, children would play the game by throwing a feathered stick through the rolling hoop. Salish and Pend d'Oreilles youth played hoop and arrow games \\"to become skillful at bringing down small game for the village\\" in early spring, when the men were gone in search of large game. Among the European settlers, hoop- rolling was a seasonal sport, seeing the greatest activity in the winter.American Education (1910), Vols. 14–15. Nabu Press p. 350 . Children, besides rolling the hoops, also tossed them back and forth, catching them on their sticks. In the 1830s, hoop trundling was seen as an activity so characteristic of the young that it was adopted by a fanatic sect in Kentucky whose members mimicked children's activities in order to gain access to heaven.\\"The Fanatics in New York\\" (1832). From The North American Review. March 26, 1899, p. 23 Hoop driving was also seen as a remedy for the sedentary and overprotected lives led by many American girls of the mid-19th century.Wisconsin journal of education, Volume 1 By Wisconsin. Dept. of Public Instruction, Wisconsin Education Association Council, Wisconsin Teachers' Association, Wisconsin Education Association; p. 52; 1857 The game was popular with both girls and boys: in an 1898 survey of 1000 boys and 1000 girls in Massachusetts, both the girls and the boys named hoop and stick their favorite toy. In Ohio, the wood of the American elm (Ulmus americana) was particularly valued for making hoop-poles. At Bryn Mawr College, Wellesley College, and Wheaton College, the Hoop Rolling Contest is an annual spring tradition that dates back to 1895, and is only open to graduating seniors on that college's May Day celebration.

The airline's initial services were between Adelaide and Broken Hill. The airline grew rapidly and in 1934 transferred its main base to Perth, after winning a Commonwealth Government contract for air services to the north-west of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. The airline has had to endure hardship and cope with long distances in the vast state of Western Australia.  Aircraft  Early aircraft used by the airline included Avro Ansons, de Havilland DH.84 Dragons, Lockheed Model 10 Electras and Douglas DC-3s. Later aircraft included the Fokker F27 Friendship turboprop, a leased Vickers Viscount turboprop, a Douglas DC-9 twinjet leased from Ansett, Piaggios, de Havilland of Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter STOL turboprops, Fokker F28 Fellowship (both 1000 and 4000 series twinjets) and British Aerospace BAe 146 jet aircraft. The airline's Fokkers were amongst the hardest working in the world with some of the highest utilisation rates in the world. MMA's F28s flew the world's longest twinjet route at one stage, and certainly the world's longest F28 flight, Perth to Kununurra. MMA also flew one of the world's shortest scheduled air services, from Perth to Rottnest Island flying the Douglas DC-3 and later the Fokker F-27 Friendship turboprop airliner. MMA's first Fokker F28 Fellowship was actually leased from Braathens SAFE of Norway (VH-MMJ c/n 11013) and returned to Fokker as PH-ZAH after the first of the ordered aircraft arrived. VH-FKD was originally purchased for Ansett division Airlines of New South Wales but transferred to MMA when it proved uneconomical on the NSW intrastate routes. Ironically this aircraft returned to Airlines of New South Wales service several years later. * The first F27, VH-MMS, RMA-SWAN, was the 39th of the Fokker production line, but the first F27 in the world to reach 10,000 hours. This aircraft flew an average of 15 hours a day, five days per week to some of the most remote places in the world. * VH-FKA, RMA Pilbara, was the first Fokker F28 Fellowship in the World to exceed 30,000 hrs and was later re- commissioned by Airlines of New South Wales before returning to Perth. It made its final revenue flight Perth-Port Hedland on 26 May 1995 after over 60,000 hrs. VH-FKA was scrapped at Tullamarine Airport, Melbourne in January 1996.  Corporate history  Douglas DC-3 in 1948 During 1919, Captain Horatio (later Horace) ‘Horrie’ Clive Miller purchased Armstrong Whitworth F.K.8 G-AUCF from the United Kingdom and eventually launched the Commercial Aviation Company, in Rochester, Victoria. On 8 October 1920, he registered the Commercial Aviation Company. In 1927, the Commercial Aviation Company commenced weekly Adelaide- Mount Gambier services, using Airco D.H.9 G-AUHT. During late 1927, the MacRobertson-Miller Aviation Co Pty. Ltd. was founded by Horrie C. Miller & Sir MacPherson Robertson, the millionaire confectionery manufacturer. It was not registered until 28 May 1928. In October 1934, MacRobertson-Miller Aviation transferred its main base to Perth, after it won the Commonwealth Government's contract for North-West services, previously operated by West Australian Airways Fokker F27 Friendship turboprop airliner at Essendon Airport in 1971 In 1955, MacRobertson-Miller Aviation Co. Pty. Ltd. & Airlines (W.A.) Ltd. were merged, to form MacRobertson Miller Airlines Ltd.,The Argus - 24 June 1955, p.16 Retrieved 2011-10-26 at the request of the State Government.RAAF Association of WA Retrieved 2011-10-26 MacRobertson Miller Airlines Ltd. began operations; combining the operations of MacRobertson Miller Aviation Co. Ltd. and Airlines (W.A.) Ltd., over a network of more than 32,000 km, from Esperance in Western Australia to Darwin in the Northern Territory. On 19 April 1963, Ansett Transport Industries (ATI). purchased MacRobertsons Pty Ltd's 62% share in MMA, plus some 8% of MMA owned by Horrie Miller, via Miller Investments Pty Ltd, to give it 70.49% (654,716 of 953,314 shares) of MMA shares, after MMA, in desperate need of funds for new Fokker F27 Friendship aircraft and planned new jet aircraft, approached Ansett to purchase a major share. On 1 June 1963, MacRobertson Miller Airlines. was renamed MacRobertson Miller Airline Services & became a division of Ansett Transport Industries. Fokker F28 Fellowship at Perth Airport in the early 1970s In 1968 the airline adopted the Ansett \\"Delta\\" livery for its company image, introducing the new scheme on its leased Fokker F28 Friendship substituting the name MMA for Ansett on aircraft, vehicles and stationery. MMA was renamed Airlines of Western Australia in 1981 using a new red and green colour scheme and a stylised kangaroo paw logo (the floral emblem of Western Australia). This scheme was adopted with the introduction of the first of the new Fokker F28 Fellowship 4000 series after Peter Abeles and Rupert Murdoch acquired control of the Ansett Group, as part of a restructuring of the local divisions. Airlines of Western Australia was then renamed Ansett WA in 1984 and once again it adopted the parent companies livery and image. It was also briefly named Air WA prior to naming it Ansett WA, although this only appeared on a single BAe 146 aircraft which was repainted Ansett WA before entering line service. In 1993 the division was absorbed by Ansett, and any connection with its Western Australian heritage vanished. On 14 September 2001 Ansett collapsed. By the time it became an integral part of the Ansett group, it was Australia's oldest continually-operating domestic airline, and one of the oldest airlines in the world. MMA was affectionately referred to by the West Australian locals as \\"Mickey Mouse Airlines\\". MMA operated out of Perth Airport. The main road leading into Perth Airport's International Terminal 1 is named after Horrie Miller. MMA usually named its aircraft after Western Australian rivers, and the last letter of the aircraft registration reflected this i.e. Fokker F27 \\"RMA SWAN\\" had VH-MMS, \\"RMA ROBE\\" VH-MMR etc. One exception was Fokker F27 VH-MMU, \\"RMA MABUHAY\\", leased from Philippine Airlines. The name meant \\"welcome\\" in one of the Filipino dialects. The F28s were named after Western Australian regions (Pilbara, Kimberley, Goldfields etc.), and the F28s' registrations \\"FK\\" prefix reflected the aircraft manufacturer, Fokker. One of the later jets was named after the founder of the airline, Horrie Miller.  Accidents and incidents  * On 1 July 1949, Douglas DC-3 \\"Fitzroy\\" on a schedule flight to Darwin and carrying 14 passengers and a crew of 4 crashed after take-off from Perth in heavy rain. The aircraft crashed into an area of disused army huts north of the town of Guildford (a town directly in line with Perth Airport's major runway 21/03). It is believed to have been caused by the aircraft being incorrectly loaded. *On 31 December 1968, Vickers Viscount \\"Quininup\\" VH-RMQ leased from Ansett- ANA broke up in mid-air and crashed south of Port Hedland Airport in the scrub on Indee Station. 22 passengers and the 4 crew on board were killed. The aircraft was originally purchased by Trans Australia Airlines. *Fokker F28 Flight MV 372 Perth to Port Hedland - 30 July 1971, VH-FKC: During the long late night hop destination and onward airports became blanketed with fog. The F28 became dangerously low on fuel and after circling for some time Captain Harold Rowell considered ditching the aircraft in the ocean. However, he eventually landed the jet on a gravel runway in the isolated town of Fitzroy Crossing, landing with less than ten minutes of fuel remaining. No life was lost and no injury occurred. *Fokker F28 Fellowships of MMA assisted with the evacuation of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy in December 1974. One F28-1000 carried 128 evacuees, mostly children, on a flight to Perth, though most aircraft carried 80, 20 more than the standard 60 passengers. The MMA F28s helped evacuate 1,250 people out of Darwin in four days. *On 17 January 1974, Fokker F-28-1000 VH-FKA operating Flight MV 492 (a Perth to Darwin “milk run” with 4 stops) overran the runway at Broome Airport, Western Australia. The weather was wet and the aircraft overran the runway threshold by 82 metres, crashing through a wire and picket fence before stopping with the nosewheel sunk in mud and 150 ml of water. There were no injuries and some minor damage to the aircraft nosewheel doors, a fuselage mounted landing light and the oxygen access panel.F.28-FKA-Broome-runway-overrun-bogged-17.1.74-GG-coll-KKK *On 26 September 1983, Fokker F28 VH-FKA took off from Perth Airport on a routine flight to the North West. As the aircraft banked left after takeoff on Runway 21, the main passenger door/airstairs suddenly opened. The air hostess sitting in the jump seat adjacent the door lost her shoes. The door had been closed but the lock bar had not been moved to the upright ‘lock’ position. Ground crew also failed to see the outside door release (aft of the door on the fuselage) was not in the correct horizontal position. The co-pilot also failed to see that the door ‘unlatched’ light (which was orange in colour) had remained on. This check formed part of the pre taxi checklist. However, bright sunlight glare through the starboard cockpit windows made it difficult to see that the light was on. The door fell open as the cabin pressure increased and as the aircraft climbed and banked left. The aircraft circled for two hours above Perth burning fuel before making a safe though spectacular landing.

He became famous for his participation in the Supreme Court cases Stenberg v. Carhart and Gonzales v. Carhart, both of which dealt with intact dilation and extraction (also known as \\"partial-birth abortion\\"). A former Republican, he was one of the four subjects of the 2013 documentary After Tiller. Biography Carhart trained as a physician in the U.S. Air Force, and retired from the force with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He is a graduate of Rutgers University,Class Directory and a 1973 graduate of Hahnemann University School of Medicine (now Drexel University College of Medicine). =Medical practice= After 21 years as a surgeon in the Air Force, Carhart opened a walk-in emergency clinic in Omaha in 1985. On September 6, 1991, the day of the passage of the Nebraska Parental Notification Law, arsonists targeted Carhart's farm, setting fire to his home and a 48-stall barn, along with two other buildings and numerous vehicles. The attack killed two family pets and 21 horses. The fire, which had started in seven different locations on Carhart's property, was never declared arson and no one was prosecuted. Carhart stated that he received a note the morning after the fire claiming responsibility and likening the deaths of his animals to the \\"murder of children\\". At the time of the fire, abortions had been a small part of Carhart's surgical practice; afterwards, determined not to \\"cede a victory to the antis\\", Carhart began performing abortions full- time. In February 2013, a 29-year-old woman who had been 33 weeks pregnant with a medically abnormal fetus died a day after a four-day abortion procedure at Carhart's clinic in Germantown. The medical examiner listed the causes of death as \\"amniotic fluid embolism following a medical termination of pregnancy\\", disseminated intravascular coagulation and fetal abnormalities. The Maryland Board of Physicians found that Carhart was not responsible for the death. The board’s letter followed an investigation by state health officials that reported there were \\"no deficiencies\\" in Carhart’s handling of the situation, and that the death could have happened during birth as well. In spite of this, right-to-life groups accused Dr. Carhart of \\"kill[ing the] woman\\" and \\"get[ting] away with murder\\". =Court cases= Carhart filed suit against the Nebraska Attorney General, Don Stenberg, because a Nebraska law banned a form of abortion, dilation and extraction (D&X;), which involves partially delivering a fetus from the uterus and is sometimes termed \\"partial- birth abortion\\". In Stenberg v. Carhart the United States Supreme Court struck down the Nebraska law with Sandra Day O'Connor providing the swing vote for the five-to-four decision because the law did not allow for the use of the procedure even when the mother's health would be put at greater risk by another abortion procedure. Carhart later filed suit against U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales seeking to strike down the 2003 Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a federal law that is similar to the state law struck down in Stenberg, but while the Court did not officially reverse Stenberg, it upheld the federal ban as not imposing an undue burden on women, the test established in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.Gonzales v. Carhart opinions (in PDF). O'Connor's successor, Samuel Alito, sided with the four Justices who dissented in Stenberg, creating a five-to-four majority.

The Loj clearing is at lower left. Henry Van Hoevenberg's original Adirondack Loj, that burned in 1903 The Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK) is a nonprofit organization founded in 1922. It has approximately 30,000 members. The ADK is dedicated to the protection and responsible recreational use of the New York State Forest Preserve, parks, wild lands, and waters; it conducts conservation, and natural history programs. There are 27 local chapters in New York and New Jersey. The club has worked to increase state holdings in the Adirondack Park and to protect the area from commercial development. History The idea of forming the ADK was conceived by Meade C. Dobson, an official of the New York State Association of Real Estate Boards and the Palisades Interstate Park Trail Conference, who felt there was need for a private organization that could help the State develop trails and shelters to make remote areas of the Adirondacks more accessible to hikers and backpackers. Encouraged by support from George D. Pratt, Conservation Commissioner of New York State, and William G. Howard, Superintendent of Forests, Dobson invited other like-minded individuals to an organizational meeting. The initial meeting, attended by 40 people, took place on December 5, 1921, in the log cabin atop the Abercrombie & Fitch sporting goods store in New York City. An organization committee was formed, including representatives of outing, recreational, educational, government, and business interests. The club's objectives were to develop and maintain hiking trails, to construct and maintain campsites and permanent camps, to publish trail maps and guidebooks, and to educate the public regarding the conservation of natural resources and prevention of forest fires. In its early years when there were few trails, ADK supplemented the work of the New York State Conservation Department by clearing and marking 140 miles of trails. One of the first trails constructed by club members was the 133-mile Northville- Placid Trail which traverses the Adirondacks in a north-south orientation. Gifford Pinchot, first chief of the U.S. Forest Service, was an early member, and Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were life members of the ADK. In an introduction to the club's 20th anniversary Annual Report in 1942, then president Roosevelt wrote \\"[This is] an appropriate time to emphasize the Club's initial statement of policy, adhered to and acted upon vigorously throughout the years, that 'the Adirondack Forest preserve belongs to the people of the State of New York' and that 'we believe in a continuing policy that shall give the widest and wisest use of the Forest to all.' \\" Activities The club maintains two lodges, the Adirondak Loj in North Elba and the Johns Brook Lodge in Keene Valley, which provide bunkrooms and private rooms, and communal meals as well as campsites. Johns Brook, at the foot of the Great Range, is accessible only by hiking, with the easiest route being a hike from Keene Valley. ADK offers extensive programming all across New York State all year around. Activities include hiking, biking, paddling, snowshoeing, skiing and much more.

In addition to medical and pharmaceutical sciences, he was also an adept in theological, philosophic and ethical sciences.Shams Ardekani, Mohammad Reza (Medical University of Tehran); Moatar, Fariborz (Medical University of Isfahan), A Research Conducted on the Life and Works of Hakim Sayyid Esmail Jurjani. He was a Persian physician and learned the rudiments of medicine in Kunya-Urgench, Old Urgench or Urganj of Uzbekistan. Jurjani was a pupil of Ibn Abi Sadiq and Ahmad ibn Farrokh. He arrived at the court in the Persian province of Khwarazm in the year 1110 when he was already a septuagenarian. There he became a court physician to the governor of the province, Khwarazm-Shah Qutb al-Din Muhammad I, who ruled from 1097 to 1127. It was to him that he dedicated his most comprehensive and influential work, the Persian-language compendium Zakhirah-i Khvarazm'Shahi. Jurjani continued as court physician to Khwarazm'Shah Qutb al-Din's son and successor, Ala al- Din Atsiz, until at some unspecified time he moved to the city of Merv, the capital of the rival Seljuq Sultan Sanjar (ruled 1118–1157), where he died nearly at 100 lunar years of age. Jurjani composed a number of important medical and philosophical treatises, in both Persian and Arabic, most of them written after he moved to Khwarazm at the age of 70 lunar years. Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm Al-Jurjani wrote the Persian medical encyclopedia, Thesaurus of the Shah of Khwarazm (also known as The Treasure of Khwarazm Shah), some time after 1110, when he moved to the northern Persian province of Khwarezm. Much of his work was dependent on Avicenna's The Canon of Medicine (c. 1025), along with al-Jurjani's own ideas not found in the Canon. The work is composed of ten volumes covering ten medical fields: anatomy, physiology, hygiene, diagnosis and prognosis, fevers, diseases particular to a part of the body, surgery, skin diseases, poisons and antidotes, and medicaments (both simple and compound).Life and Works of Hakim Seyed Ismail Jorjani by Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman, Majmua-e Maqalat Kangrah Buzargdasht Hakim Seyed Ismail Jorjani, Farhangistan Uloom Puzishki, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2000: 125–133 In endocrinology in particular, al-Jurjani was one of \\"the first to associate exophthalmos with goitre,\\" which was not repeated until Caleb Parry (1755–1822) in 1825, and later by Robert James Graves (1796–1853) and Carl von Basedow (1799–1854).

Aramis included the unique feature of non- mechanical platooning that allowed the small cars to run as virtual trains in areas of higher transit density. This would allow the system to maintain high throughput in busy areas, with the trains breaking up into individual cars and going their separate ways as they approached their destination. In spite of considerable development, the platooning system was never made to work properly, and the cars tended to bump and jar in testing. The project was eventually shut down in November 1987, its place taken by the conventional Véhicule Automatique Léger system developed through the same period.J. Edward Anderson, \\"Some Lessons from the History of Personal Rapid Transit (PRT)\\", read online on faculty.washington.edu Phase 0 of Aramis began in 1969. During Phase 0, the patent was processed, a test site was determined, and the Aramis development committee was created. Phase 1 started in 1974. During Phase 1, more test sites were researched, variable-reluctance motor was developed and Aramis' competition was eliminated. Phase 2a began in 1977. During Phase 2a, Aramis was simplified for economic reasons. Phase 3A started in 1978, and during phase 3A tests of the system's main components were run, and more site analyses took place at test locations. Phase 3B was the final phase for Aramis; it started in 1982. During the report for phase 3B, Aramis looked like it was in good shape; however, at the end of phase 3B Aramis was abandoned. Technical development was conducted by \\"Engins Matra\\" company, which then became Matra Transport (and later absorbed by Siemens under the same \\"Siemens Transportation Systems\\", now a part of Siemens mobility). The project was financed by the French agency DATAR (; English: Inter-ministerial Delegation for Territorial Planning and Regional Attractiveness). The project met with various failures, for both social and technological reasons. In Bruno Latour's book on the subject, Aramis, or the Love of Technology, the author explores the various shortcomings that led to the stillbirth of the project. The original intention for Aramis was to be an ideal urban transportation system based on private cars in constant motion and the elimination of unnecessary transfers. This new form of transportation was intended to be as secure and inexpensive as collective transportation. The proposed system had custom- designed motors, sensors, controls, digital electronics, software and a major installation (the \\"CET\\") in southern Paris. The demonstration of the technology in 1970 was a success. What set Aramis apart from other personal rapid transit projects were non-material couplings. Non-material couplings were linking elements that would allow each vehicle to be self-contained, while moving in unison. Unlike trains, individual Aramis were not physically attached. The 1972 prototype featured a piece of track 800–1000 meters long, a fixed station, a movable station that would have included a workshop, a control post, a reception building, a parking lot, and five full scale cars (two for passengers, three reserved for measuring instruments). Social concerns made the development of Aramis difficult; the safety of passengers was at risk because of the lack of security in private cars. Point-to-point travel for passengers, an essential feature of Personal Rapid Transit, was removed from the specifications around 1973 because of the extra cost of the turnouts.

Early career (1982–1995) Pitrelli attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the early 1980s (where keyboardist Derek Sherinian was his dorm roommate; they would later work together in the Alice Cooper band). While at Berklee, Al formed an original 1980s metal band with classmates that included Venom guitarist Mike Hickey. After dropping out of Berklee, Pitrelli worked as a session musician during his early days, and also taught guitar lessons in Manhattan, and in Bellmore, Long Island. His first major label gig was performing with Michael Bolton, helping him support his single \\"Fool's Game\\". Pitrelli said of the single, \\"This was when Michael Bolton was still trying to be Sammy Hagar and not Engelbert Humperdinck.\\" Al Pitrelli career history & bio. In the late 1980s/early 1990s, Pitrelli joined forces with bassist Randy Coven and drummer John Reilly to release two Shrapnel Records-type albums titled \\"Sammy Says Ouch\\" and \\"CPR\\". Pitrelli was Alice Cooper's guitarist and musical director from 1989 until 1991 on the Trashes The World tour. He then joined Dee Snider's band Widowmaker for two albums in the early/mid–1990s, and also briefly played with Stephen Pearcy (from the band Ratt) in a band called Vertex. Pitrelli also joined Asia, appearing on their albums Aqua (1992) and Aria (1994). He would go on to be featured on many New York sessions, including for Kathy Troccoli, Taylor Dayne, Randy Coven and Exposé. His songs have been covered by Y&T;, Lita Ford and Derek Sherinian. For a month he substituted in Blue Öyster Cult. Widowmaker (w/ Dee Snider) albums \\"Blood & Bullets\\" (1994) & \\"Standby For Pain\\" (1995) Savatage (1995–2000) Al joined Savatage in 1995, joining at the same time as Chris Caffery returned to the band; Caffery had previously been part of the band around the release of Gutter Ballet in 1989. Pitrelli played guitar on the albums Dead Winter Dead (1995) and The Wake of Magellan (1997), and performed some lead guitar work on Poets and Madmen (2001), despite being a member of Megadeth at the time. On that album, Pitrelli was responsible for the outro of \\"Stay with Me a While\\", the main solos of \\"Morphine Child\\" and \\"The Rumor\\", the first part of the main solo in \\"Commissar\\" and its outro.) Savatage Band FAQ, taken from www.savatage.com During his time with Savatage, he was asked by their producer Paul O'Neill if he was interested in joining his side project, the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Pitrelli agreed and has played a role in all of their albums to date. Trans Siberian Orchestra (1995–present) Pitrelli has been a core member of the group since their first album. As well as being the main lead guitarist, he is also the live musical director. TSO's 2007 tour program credits his \\"edgy playing and vast musical lexicon\\" with making him a perfect fit for the band's constant boundary-pushing progressive rock stylings. Pitrelli's leads are notable on \\"Tracers\\" and the instrumental \\"Toccatta – Carpimus Nocten\\",Sea of Tranquility, October 27, 2009 the latter being a piece he co-wrote. Both songs form part of the group's fifth rock opera, on their 2009 album Night Castle.Night Castle album credits. Megadeth (2000–02) Pitrelli was a member of Megadeth from 2000–02, replacing Marty Friedman. Megadeth bandleader Dave Mustaine asked him to join after hearing good reviews from their then- current drummer Jimmy DeGrasso, with whom Pitrelli played during his days with Alice Cooper in the early 1990s. Pitrelli joined the band after an impromptu \\"audition\\" in front of a live crowd in Vancouver on January 16, 2000. Two nights after Friedman played his last show with Megadeth, Pitrelli was asked to play fifteen minutes before the show and was shocked by the prospect as they never rehearsed. He was present during the recording of Rude Awakening, a live CD/DVD that was released in 2002. Pitrelli performed on their 2001 album The World Needs a Hero, which has the song \\"Promises\\" which was co-written by Pitrelli and he played most of the guitar solos. When Megadeth entered hiatus after Mustaine injured his arm, Pitrelli rejoined Savatage on April 9, 2002, but did not tour with the band. He also continued his work with TSO, which he's still a member of today. Recent work (2002–present) In 1998, Pitrelli was featured on the video game album Sonic Adventure Remix, where he played guitar on a remix of the game's theme song \\"Open Your Heart\\". Personal life Al Pitrelli is currently married to Nicole Pitrelli in which they have two children: Olivia and Layla. Al also has three sons Jesse, Jamie and Zak.

He served as Bishop of Wilmington from 1968 until his death in 1984. Biography Thomas Mardaga was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Thomas and Agnes (née Ryan) Mardaga. He received his early education at the parochial school of St. Ann Church in his native city. He attended St. Charles College in Catonsville before studying for the priesthood at St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore. He was ordained a priest by Archbishop Michael J. Curley on May 14, 1940. Mardaga then served as a curate at St. Paul Church in Baltimore until being transferred to the Basilica of the Assumption, where he later became rector. In addition to his pastoral work, he served as archdiocesan director of the Catholic Youth Organization and the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine, executive secretary of the Catholic Charities Fund, and a member of the archdiocesan board of consultors. He was named a domestic prelate in 1963. On December 9, 1966, Mardaga was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Baltimore and titular bishop of Mutugenna by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on January 25, 1967 from Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, with Bishops John Joyce Russell and Thomas Austin Murphy serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen. As an auxiliary bishop, he continued to serve as rector of the Basilica of the Assumption. Following the death of Bishop Michael William Hyle, Mardaga was named the sixth Bishop of Wilmington, Delaware, on March 9, 1968. His installation took place at St. Elizabeth Church in Wilmington on April 6 of that year. During his 16-year tenure, he continued the implementation of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, establishing a council for the laity and participating in ecumenical work. He also reorganized the diocesan curia and created a ministry for migrant workers. Mardaga died from cancer at St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington.

In addition, many states in the United States have either adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence, with or without local variations, or have revised their own evidence rules or codes to at least partially follow the federal rules. History The law of evidence governs the proof of facts and the inferences flowing from such facts during the trial of civil and criminal lawsuits. Before the twentieth century, evidence law was largely the product of decisional law. During the twentieth century, projects such as the California Evidence Code and the Uniform Rules of Evidence encouraged the codification of those common law evidence rules. In 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren appointed an advisory committee of fifteen to draft the new rules. The committee was composed of lawyers and legal scholars from across the country. The Federal Rules of Evidence began as rules proposed pursuant to a statutory grant of authority, the Rules Enabling Act, but were eventually enacted as statutory law. The United States Supreme Court circulated drafts of the FRE in 1969, 1971 and 1972, but Congress then exercised its power under the Rules Enabling Act to suspend implementation of the FRE until it could study them further. After a long delay blamed on the Watergate scandal, the FRE became federal law on January 2, 1975, when President Ford signed An Act to Establish Rules of Evidence for Certain Courts and Proceedings, , . The law was enacted only after Congress made a series of modifications to the proposed rules. Much of the debate on the Rules stemmed from concerns that came to lawmakers' attention due to the Watergate scandal, particularly questions of privilege.Christopher B. Mueller, Laird C. Kirkpatrick. Evidence (4th ed., 2009). Aspen Treatise Series. . Some of the most prominent congressional amendments when Congress adopted the rules included: * Prior Inconsistent Statement – Rule 801(d)(1)(A): Congress amended the proposed rule so that the \\"rule now requires that the prior inconsistent statement be given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition. The rule as adopted covers statements before a grand jury.\\" * Privileges – Rule 501: Although the original proposal included thirteen rules providing for various privileges, Congress struck all of them. To guide privileges in the federal courts, Congress adopted Rule 501. The rule specified that except as otherwise provided by Act of Congress or by other federal rules, privileges in the federal courts would be \\"governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the light of reason and experience\\". Rule 501 meant that the entire purpose of the FRE (to provide clarity and supersede prior case law) was defeated in the specific context of the law of privileges. Thus, to this day, attorneys practicing in U.S. federal courts must carefully research current case law to determine the contours of available privileges in the particular circuit and district in which their case is being heard. In contrast, the California Evidence Code, from which the original proposal had been drawn, had expressly codified all evidentiary privileges and then displaced the common law, so that any further privileges in the courts of that state would have to come from the California State Legislature. * Impeachment by Conviction – Rule 609(a): The rule specified when a party could use evidence of a prior conviction to impeach a witness. Congress reformed most of Rule 609(a), to specify when a court could exercise discretion to admit evidence of a conviction which was a felony, but that the court must admit the prior conviction if the crime was one involving \\"dishonesty or false statement\\". The Advisory Committee Notes still function as an important source of material used by courts to interpret the Rules. Even though the Federal Rules of Evidence are statutory, the Supreme Court is empowered to amend the Rules, subject to congressional disapproval. However, amendments creating, abolishing, or modifying privileges require affirmative approval by Congress under . Purpose In general, the purpose of rules of evidence is to regulate the evidence that the jury may use to reach a verdict. Historically, the rules of evidence reflected a marked distrust of jurors. The Federal Rules of Evidence strive to eliminate this distrust, and encourage admitting evidence in close cases. Even so, there are some rules that perpetuate the historical mistrust of jurors, expressly limiting the kind of evidence they may receive or the purpose for which they may consider it. At the same time, the Rules center on a few basic ideasrelevance, unfair surprise, efficiency, reliability, and overall fairness of the adversary process. The Rules grant trial judges broad discretion to admit evidence in the face of competing arguments from the parties. This ensures that the jury has a broad spectrum of evidence before it, but not so much evidence that is repetitive, inflammatory, or unnecessarily confusing. The Rules define relevance broadly and relax the common-law prohibitions on witnesses' competence to testify. Hearsay standards are similarly relaxed, as are the standards for authenticating written documents. At the same time, the judge retains power to exclude evidence that has too great a danger for unfair prejudice to a party due to its inflammatory, repetitive, or confusing nature or its propensity to waste the court's time. Structure There are 67 individually numbered rules, divided among 11 articles: # General Provisions # Judicial Notice # Presumptions in Civil Actions and Proceedings # Relevancy and Its Limits # Privileges # Witnesses # Opinions and Expert Testimony # Hearsay # Authentication and Identification # Contents of Writings, Recordings, and Photographs # Miscellaneous Rules The Rules embody some very common concepts, and lawyers frequently refer to those concepts by the rule number. The most important conceptthe balancing of relevance against other competing interestsis embodied in Rule 403. One of the most common competing interests is the danger of unfair prejudice. An example of otherwise relevant testimony being barred for the danger of unfair prejudice is as follows: A person is on trial for committing a crime. The defendant's alibi is that he was at a meeting of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan during the time the crime was committed. The defendant has numerous witnesses who can place him at this meeting. The relevant part of this testimony is that the defendant was at a place other than the scene of the crime at the time the crime was committed. On cross examination it is generally relevant to delve into specifics about any alleged alibi such as who was there, what type of meeting it was etc. to ensure the defendant is being truthful. However the relevance of what type of meeting the defendant was attending to weighing the credibility of the story in this example is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice as the majority of Americans would view the defendant's participation in the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan to be immoral and is therefore inadmissible. While the rules proscribe certain testimony from being admissible for one purpose, but it may be admissible for another. An example of this is Rule 404, specifically 404(b) as it pertains to specific instances of a person's conduct. While 404 generally prohibits use of prior acts and crimes to show that a defendant acted in accordance with those prior acts or crimes, 404(b) provides: Essentially testimony about an act a person has committed in the past is not admissible for the purposes of showing it is more likely that they committed the same act, however it could be admissible for another purpose, such as knowledge or lack of mistake. For example, in a DUI case, the prosecutor may not admit evidence of a prior instance of driving impaired to show that the defendant acted in conformity and drove impaired on the day he is charged with doing so. However such evidence may be admissible if the defense has argued the defendant had no knowledge driving impaired was a crime. Evidence of his prior arrest, conviction, or other circumstances surrounding his prior instance of impaired driving then becomes admissible to rebut the claim of \\"mistake.\\" The testimony is now being offered not for conformity but to demonstrate knowledge or lack of mistake. Other common-law concepts with previously amorphous limits have been more clearly delineated. This is especially true regarding hearsay evidence. Among scholars and in historical judicial decisions, four related definitions of \\"hearsay\\" emerged, and the various exceptions and exemptions flowed from the particular definition preferred by the scholar or court. The Federal Rules of Evidence settled on one of these four definitions and then fixed the various exceptions and exemptions in relation to the preferred definition of hearsay. On the other hand, the law of privileges remains a creature of federal common law under the Rules, rather than the subject of judicial interpretation of the text of the rule. Just as the Uniform Rules of Evidence had, the advisory committee draft of the rules that the Supreme Court formally transmitted to Congress codified nine evidentiary privilegesrequired reports, attorney- client, psychotherapist-patient, husband-wife, communications to clergymen, political vote, trade secrets, official secrets, and identity of informer. When debate over the privileges included in the proposed Rules threatened to delay adoption of the Rules in their entirety, Congress replaced the proposed codified privileges with what became Rule 501. The scope of the privileges under the Rules thus is the subject of federal common law, except in those situations where state law supplies the rule to be applied. Accordingly, the Supreme Court is ultimately responsible for determining which privileges exist. In the years since the adoption of the Rules, the Court has both expressly adopted a privilege, in Jaffee v. Redmond, , and expressly declined to adopt a privilege, in University of Pennsylvania v. EEOC, . When it comes to the FRE 106, under Adams, if a party seeks to enter into evidence additional parts of the writing or recording, the additional parts need not be \\"admissible\\" (i.e. comport with the other rules of evidence). Restyling On December 1, 2011, the restyled Federal Rules of Evidence became effective. Since the early 2000s, an effort had been underway to \\"restyle\\" the Federal Rules of Evidence as well as other federal court rules (e.g. the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure). According to a statement by the advisory committee which had drafted the restyled rules, the restyling was not intended to make substantive changes to the evidentiary rules, and was instead intended to be purely stylistic. On April 26, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court approved the restyled amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Under the Rules Enabling Act, the restyled amendments took effect.

Background In 1948 the Australian-American Association proposed \\"to establish a Memorial in Canberra in the form of a monument or statue, to perpetuate the services and sacrifices of the United States forces in Australia and to symbolise Australian-American comradeship in arms\\". After an appeal for finances by then Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Robert Menzies, the Australian people subscribed more than the eventual cost of £100,000, then a vast sum of money for such a public memorial, indicating the gratitude of the nation. Additional memorials were constructed in Brisbane and Adelaide that used the surplus funds. A committee, which included Richard Casey (then Minister for External Affairs and a former Australian Ambassador to the United States) and Sir Keith Murdoch, was formed to examine designs for the monument. Sydney architect Richard M. Ure won the design following a nationwide competition. Work commenced in December 1952 and took just over a year. Then Vice President, Richard Nixon, visited the site in the early stages of construction. It was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 February 1954. Description The memorial is a hollow, octagonal, tapered column with a steel framework sheeted with aluminium panels that were sandblasted to give the appearance of stone. Two murals feature at the base, one relating the story of American combat in the Pacific and the other a profile map of the United States in copper. The column is surrounded by a water-filled moat about 3m wide. Under the dedication is a bronze wreath, carved by Walter Langcake, where floral wreaths are often laid on official commemorations. The column is topped with a bronze sphere surmounted by a stylised figure of the American eagle by the distinguished sculptor, Paul Beadle. The Memorial's height is ; the eagle and sphere are together around high and weigh 3.5 tons. Location It was built at Russell Hill on the extended line of Kings Avenue, near one of the three nodes of the Parliamentary Triangle. Russell Offices has since been developed around the memorial, as the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence, with the immediate surrounds called Blamey Square after Field Marshal Sir Thomas Blamey. It underwent a major restoration in 2014, after which a new plaque at its base was unveiled. Gallery Image:PIC 9983 1-61 LOC Album1097-P. M.

Cabinentaxi systems could be operated in a variety of fashions depending on the need. It is most widely known as the first true personal rapid transit (PRT) system, where customers call up a small \\"car\\" on demand which then takes them directly to their destination without any stops along the way. The system could also be used in a group rapid transit (GRT) fashion, using larger cars with up to 18 passengers. In this case the vehicles would travel along a fixed route, stopping at any station that a passenger requested. Cabinentaxi could also mix the two modes on a single line, which allowed direct routing to high-density areas when traffic loads were low, saving the larger van-like vehicles for the high-demand periods. Cabinentaxi was in serious consideration for two deployments in the late 1970s; BMFT was in the process of funding a deployment in Hamburg while their U.S. counterpart, the Urban Mass Transit Authority (UMTA), selected it as a front-runner for a deployment in Detroit. Cabinentaxi's corporate partners decided to pull out of the Detroit competition to focus on the Hamburg development. When unrelated budget cuts drained the BMFT's coffers, the Hamburg project was also canceled, and the Cabintaxi Joint Venture gave up on the public transit field and withdrew the Cabintaxi technology from the market. The rights were purchased in 1985 by a small U.S. consortium, Cabintaxi Corporation, but no developments have followed. The only commercial use was a modified system, the Cabinlift, which operated as a horizontal elevator between buildings at the Schwalmstadt- Ziegenhain hospital in Germany until 2002. History =Background= In the early 1950s, urban planner Donn Fichter started work on a book that would eventually emerge in 1964 as Individualized Automatic Transit and the City.Donn Fichter, \\"Individualized Automatic Transit and the City\\", BH Sikes, 1964 Fitcher argued that the only way to solve the gridlock problems in cities being caused by increased car ownership was to use mass transit systems. Fichter argued that unless the systems operated more like a taxi service, arriving when called for and taking the passenger directly to their destination, people would not leave their cars to use it. Busses and metro systems are not personalized, they run on pre-planned routes and schedules, making stops along the way that do not serve each individual, only the group of riders as a whole. Fichter and other planners tapped into a zeitgeist that was being fuelled by rapid urban decay in the U.S. President Kennedy addressed congress in 1962 and stated that \\"To conserve and enhance values in existing urban areas is essential. But at least as important are steps to promote economic efficiency and livability in areas of future development. Our national welfare therefore requires the provision of good urban transportation, with the properly balanced use of private vehicles and modern mass transport to help shape as well as serve urban growth.\\"FTA, \\"The Beginnings of Federal Assistance for Public Transportation\\" Funding provided through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) led to a series of reports by a variety of aerospace firms (notably Aerospace Corporation), today known as the \\"HUD reports\\", that explored various concepts and provided strong support for the basic concepts. A follow-on bill later in the decade provided additional funding for development of several experimental systems, and created the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA). =Spectrum of designs= Other companies and government organizations soon joined these efforts, as it appeared PRT systems would soon be being deployed around the world. By the early 1970s there were at least a dozen development efforts in the U.S., a similar number in Europe and Japan, and two in Canada. The systems differed considerably in operating concept. On the \\"simple end\\" of the scale were vehicles that used a guideway to steer, and left most other operations to a centralized control centre with some form of automatic train control. These systems had fairly slow reaction times that demanded fairly long headways between the trains. Most conventional metros have headways around two minutes or more, these new systems were generally on the order of 30 seconds. To make these systems efficient at high demand levels they had to have fairly large capacities, on the order of 25 to 100 passengers, which places them in the group rapid transit, or GRT, end of the people mover spectrum. These sorts of systems can be simplified if high performance is not required; GRT systems are quite common at airports today. On the other end of the scale were the personal rapid transit systems, or PRTs. These systems abandoned centralized control for a simpler distributed solution based on set timings, speeds, or flocking behaviour. By placing the headway logic on the vehicles the reaction timing was dramatically improved, because they no longer had to communicate with a centralized system for traffic information or instructions. PRTs generally worked on headways of less than 10 seconds, which greatly increased the passenger density of the system as a whole. This allowed the vehicles to be much smaller and still retain the same system capacity as the larger GRTs, while offering the sort of personalized car-like operations that Individualized Automatic Transit envisioned. =Cabinentaxi= In 1969 Demag and MBB independently started projects studying PRT systems as a result of the HUD reports.J. Edward Anderson, \\"Some Lessons from the History of Personal Rapid Transit\\", Taxi2000, 4 August 1996 At the time, the Bundesministerium für Forschung und Technologie (BMFT) was involved in a wide variety of transport research, including a variety of maglev trains for high-speed service, several automated railway systems, as well as more mundane research in railway safety and signalling. Significant within the transportation development programs of the BMFT was the direct involvement of the VOV (German Association of Public Transit Operators), the Deutsche Bundesbahn (German Federal Railway) and their safety experts. This assured that when development was completed, the systems would meet German (and by extension international) public transit standards. When the BMFT learned of the separate efforts at Demag and MBB, they urged both companies to combine their efforts under a new joint operating company,Hesse and Bendix which became Cabinentaxi. BMFT provided 80% of the total funding, considerably less than their counterparts in the U.S., which completely funded by the UMTA. By this time the system had been well-defined, and was committed to true PRT point-to-point service. In order to avoid stops along the way, stations were \\"off-line\\", on separate guideways placed beside the main routes, allowing en-route cars to pass them by. The cars themselves would handle switching along a pre-defined route, which allowed them to be directed to an optimal path in a network of any complexity. Studies suggested a three-passenger car for the basic system, although in order to increase capacity they also had cars with seating for 6, 12 and 18 passengers. These larger cars would normally be planned to operate in GRT fashion in order to increase the overall capacity of the network in the early development stages, where small networks in dense areas would not be meaningful in a small vehicle PRT mode. The larger cars could also be connected front-to-back to form two- car trains, further increasing capacity for some simple applications. One problem with all elevated transportation system structures in general, is that the guideways (highways or transit) are widely considered to be an eyesore. In order to reduce the size of the guideways, Cabinentaxi took the uncommon approach of optionally allowing its cars to run on the top or bottom of a single track. The cars could not be switched from top to bottom, however. If this option was used, the guideways were supported on pillars that attached to the track from the side, rather than directly below. Cabinentaxi's guideway is noticeably smaller and thinner than conventional elevated systems, like the Vancouver SkyTrain. The track is approximately six feet wide, slightly smaller than a row of parking spots on the side of a city street. =Prototypes and testing= Testing of the motor and control systems started in 1972 on a 13-meter closed-loop track, running for 18 months. This was followed in August 1973 by a 150 meter test track and three 3-passenger vehicles installed near Hagen, Germany. The test track was expanded several times. By October 1974 it was 1136 meters long and featured two passenger stations with a closed-loop track, adding two additional vehicles for a total of five. By 1975 it had three stations and nine vehicles. The first 12-person vehicle was introduced that October. The final expansion was completed in 1976, bringing the total track to 1.9 km with six stations and twenty-four vehicles. In 1975, Raytheon Missile Systems examined the prototype system and decided to license it for deployment in the U.S., but a final agreement was never reached. Cabinentaxi technology logged over 400,000 vehicle-miles between 1975 and 1978 on the Hagen test track. In 1977 the system completed fleet operation endurance testing of 7500 continuous vehicle hours, extending that in 1978 to 10,000 continuous vehicle hours. These are the only PRT fleet endurance test of these magnitudes ever carried out. Headways were reduced throughout the period, vehicle separations started at under 3 seconds, reaching 1.9 seconds in later tests, about the same as cars on a highway. The basic operating speed was also increased during testing, from the original 30 km/h to 36 in the later tests, with options for even higher speeds in production versions. Late in the program a number of safety studies were carried out. Fire was a major concern of safety officials, but due to the simplicity of the vehicles, and a fire safety risk-reduction program it was demonstrated the possibility of fire was reduced to a non-issue. Other problems, like broken motors or a widespread power failure that demanded evacuation, were the primary areas of concern, but the solutions were found to lay in ground-based equipment and in specially equipped rescue cars that could operate on the guideway and access both levels. The final system plans required no external walkways. =Cabinlift= While work on the basic Cabinentaxi continued, a modified version known as Cabinlift was also developed. Originally designed for installations in healthcare facilities, Cabinlift was based on substantially similar technology as the basic Cabinentaxi. The Cabinlift cars were larger and taller, allowing easy walk-on access for passengers and bulky loads, notably wheeled hospital beds and gurneys. The cars could be built with the doors on the side, or on the ends. Unlike Cabinentaxi, passengers in Cabinlift could stand with some fold-down seats available. One Cabinlift system with two stations was installed at the Schwalmstadt-Ziegenhain hospital in 1975 and operative until 2002. A larger and more complex network was planned for the central hospital in Bremen, but funding fell through.Jerry Schneider (originally from Cabinentaxi), \\"Graphics from a Study for a Cabinlift Application at the Bremen Central Hospital Complex, Bremen, Germany\\", 5 December 2005 =Deployment projects= When the safety studies were completed the various levels of government signed off on the system and released it for commercial development. Several developments were already being studied by that point. One was an expansion of the original Hagen system, done as much as an example of the planning process as a serious proposal. This deployment envisioned a staged development starting with the 12-passenger cars in a network of about 40 stations covering the downtown core. Additional lines would then be added until it was fully expanded with 138 km of track and 182 stations covering the majority of the city and several surrounding suburbs and towns. The outlying tracks would primarily use the smaller cars.Hagen study Funding for this deployment was not forthcoming. A system was proposed for Hamburg, initially consisting of approximately 7.5 miles of over and under guideway with 11 stations and 50 vehicles. In 1977 Hamburger Hochbahn estimated the total costs for this initial installation to be $56,568,000, or $7.5 million per double lane mile (compare with a Canadian estimate from 1980 at $75 to $80 million per mile for underground subway lines). These were not the final system costs which would have only been determined after construction, and cost increases were already being experienced as the project neared the start of construction. The Hamburg development coincided with a request by the American government for increased defence spending by the NATO allies, which resulted in a funding cut to all other departments of the German government. BMFT withdrew funding for the Hamburg project with a statement that, among other things, the failure to pursue the export market and the mandated budget cuts led to its decision. Cabinentaxi, as Cabintaxi, was also one of the systems approved to contend for the UMTA's Downtown People Mover Program. It was recognized as the favorite system to win the Detroit People Mover project. For the Detroit project, the system's over-and-under beam was a major advantage as the city specified a single-beam system, and the over-and-under beam would provide bi-directional operation which the city wanted but could not otherwise get with its single beam restriction. The schedules for the Detroit People Mover Program and the Hamburg application appeared to conflict, so the consortium chose to withdraw from the US competition and concentrate on Hamburg. J. Edward Anderson, the well-known U.S. proponent of PRT systems, also selected Cabinentaxi for a proposed deployment in Indianapolis. After the initial $300,000 for the study ran out, no further money was forthcoming and the plans fell through.Boston University, \\"Will Taxi 2000 be the Rapid Transit of the Future?\\", Bostonia, Jan–Feb 1988 The developing firms found themselves without a market opportunity in Europe or the United States, and withdrew from the public transit field. Interest in the system in the U.S. lived on, and in 1985 a consortium was arranged to take over the design rights under Cabintaxi Corporation.Guyette No installations followed, however. Design =Vehicles= The final primary vehicle designs for the Cabinentaxi system were the \\"KK 3\\"(Klein Kabine 3), a three-passenger vehicle, and the \\"KK 12\\" (Klein Kabine 12), a twelve-passenger vehicle, both with a semi-automatic doors. They were designed with enough room between the seats for wheelchairs, prams or bicycles. The doors were semi-automatic, locking and unlocking under vehicle control, but slid open by the passengers. The vehicle bodies were made of aluminum over a steel chassis, riding on solid rubber wheels that engaged the guidance rails in the track.Hamburg study Cabinentaxi offered very high capacity utilization of its lines, up to 80% full before congestion would occur. Cabinentaxi also had a number of different car sizes, seating 6, 12 and 18 passengers. The larger cars could be formed into two-unit trains which could increase system capacity in small loop or shuttle operations, but the two-unit train had limited advantage in large network applications where short headways are effectively an electronic coupling. The \\"KK\\" series of vehicles, \\"KK 3, 6,12,18(all designed, but only the KK 3 and KK 12 were developed), were all of the same cross sectional area with only the length of the vehicle changed. With the same construction style in the body and undercarriages, these vehicle could share the same small vehicle guideway. =Motor and power supply= In order to provide fine control over vehicle spacing and reduce maintenance costs, the companies selected a linear motor (LIM) for the Cabinentaxi project. Linear motors were a major area of research since the 1960s when they were first introduced in the U.K. by Eric Laithwaite.Brian Bowers, \\"Obituary: Professor Eric Laithwaite\\", The Independent, 13 December 1997 As they have no moving parts, a LIM-powered vehicle would be more reliable than one using a conventional motor. Another advantage is that there is no contact between the motor and the track, so snow or rain will not affect its performance, which means a LIM vehicle does not require additional headspace in bad weather. Also, because the traction does not rely on friction, LIMs can climb much steeper grades.Shintaro Teraoka, \\"Adoption of Linear Motor Propulsion System for Subway\\" , Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau, 1998 On the downside, LIMs require a \\"reaction rail\\" for the motor to push against, which increases capital costs slightly. =Guideway= Cabinentaxi was designed to allow top or bottom running of the vehicles, or both on one track. =Guidance and control= Cabinentaxi's control system was decentralized, with three different control systems, each in command of one portion of the system's overall operation. The vehicle itself was responsible for maintaining separation from the vehicle in front of it, and automatically switching from guideway to guideway. Since the measurement and control of separation did not require communications with external systems, reaction times were greatly reduced and headways were much shorter than systems using a central computer to control spacing. There was a centralized control system used in Cabinentaxi, but it did not have direct control over the vehicles. This system was used to plan the most efficient route when a customer selected a destination and paid for it. The calculated route was then uploaded onto a magnetic stripe on the customer's fare card. The card was then inserted into a reader to call a car from the storage area or one passing by on the line, at which point the reader uploaded the route to the car's onboard computer. Once calculated the route was static, although the customer did have the option to stop at the very next station if they pressed a button in the car. A third system handled operations within the stations, which were \\"offline\\" from the main guideways. Stations had multiple berths for loading and unloading, as well as longer areas for acceleration and deceleration to collect vehicles as they switched on or off the main guideways. When a vehicle entered the station's off-ramp, it automatically slowed to a stop where the passengers would exit the car. The station computer would then direct it to a position in a storage ring to wait for the next customer. When it was called for the station would switch it back onto the main platform where the passengers would use their fare card to enter the vehicle. When a vehicle was loaded, the station computer watched the traffic on the adjacent mainline and looked for gaps in the vehicles passing by the station. When a suitable gap was seen, the station would calculate the time needed for the car to accelerate up to mainline speed, and then give it the go command at the right time so it would reach the switch onto the mainline right as the gap was reaching it. =Loading and system capacity= Key to the efficient operation of any PRT system is the queuing of free vehicles throughout the stations on the system. Increasing the number of idle vehicles reduces the passenger wait times, as well as reducing the need to move empty vehicles through the system in order to pick up passengers. However, this also requires additional vehicles, thereby increasing capital costs. Communications between the centralized computer and the station computers allowed cars to be switched from station to station in order to keep the stations supplied with free vehicles.

His grandson, M. Russell Ballard, also became an apostle. Birth and early life Ballard was born at Logan, Utah Territory, to Henry Ballard and Margaret McNeil. His father was a native of England and had immigrated to Utah in 1852 to gather with the Latter-day Saints. Henry Ballard had been aboard the Saluda when it exploded at Lexington, Missouri, and was injured in that incident. He later served under Porter Rockwell in the Nauvoo Legion when it made efforts to prevent the entry of Johnston's Army into Utah Territory. In 1858, Henry was the first settler of Logan, and he served as bishop of the Logan 2nd Ward from 1861 until 1900.Andrew Jenson, Latter-day Saint Biographical Encyclopedia, vol. 1, p. 418–19. Prior to Ballard's birth, his mother had an experience that led her to believe her son would be an apostle. In Ballard's patriarchal blessing, this was reaffirmed. Ballard attended Brigham Young College; he graduated in 1884. Career and early church service In June 1896, Ballard married Martha A. Jones. The following month he left with B. H. Roberts and George D. Pyper on a mission to the large cities of the eastern United States. He was later reassigned to the Northern States Mission. Ballard returned to Utah in December 1898. In 1899, Ballard organized the Logan Knitting Factory along with Joseph E. Cardon. In 1900, he became a counselor in the bishopric of the Logan 2nd Ward. Mission President Ballard served for several years as president of the Northwestern States Mission of the church. While serving in this capacity, he organized missionary work on some of the Native American reservations in Montana. Apostleship When new church president Heber J.

The system connects the three Morgantown campuses of West Virginia University (WVU) and the city's downtown area. Developed from the Alden staRRcar and built by a consortium led by Boeing Vertol, the driverless system was a government-funded experiment in PRT systems. Upon its opening in 1975 with three stations, it had a fitful start, being three years behind schedule and costing 3-4 times more than estimated. It was expanded in 1978 to its current five stations, two maintenance depots, and over 70 vehicles. Like all PRT systems, stations are built on sidings, which allows vehicles to bypass stations and permits express trips between any two station pairs. While the system achieved reliability upwards of 98% for most of its life, its reliability declined in the 2000sdipping to 90% by 2015and it gained a reputation for unreliability. In response, a renewal project was approved in 2012, which has so far replaced the vehicle control and propulsion systems, replaced parts of the power supply, and repaired other infrastructure. A new vehicle control system is due to be commissioned by 2018, and the vehicle fleet will also be replaced. History =Origins= Morgantown is a small city with about 30,000 permanent residents, with close to 140,000 in the metropolitan area. WVU adds 28,000 seasonal residents from August through May. As WVU expanded in the 1960s, geographic constraintsthe city is situated in a mountain valley along the Monongahela Riverforced WVU to build a second campus away in Evansdale. Free busing was offered to move students between the campuses, but all the roads led through the city center, creating gridlock more typical of a megacity. In the late 1960s, Samy Elias, who led WVU's industrial engineering department, learned of experiments with PRT in the U.S. after the HUD reports were published. A minor PRT craze was being set off by a combination of federal funding and estimates that showed a PRT system would be far less expensive to build and install than any other form of mass transit. Elias felt a PRT would be a perfect solution to the traffic problems in the city. Gathering support from WVU, the City of Morgantown, and West Virginia's congressional delegation, Elias arranged a $50,000 development grant from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA) for a comparative study of three PRT systems: the Monocab, Dashaveyor, and the Alden staRRcar. The Alden staRRcar was found to be the most suitable system for Morgantown. Political pressure by Senator Robert Byrd led Secretary John A. Volpe of the then-new United States Department of Transportation to propose that Morgantown be used as an experimental site for PRT development. President Richard Nixon had expressed strong support of the PRT concept, and Volpe was trying to arrange to have an experimental system well underway before the next presidential election, in November 1972. Examining the proposals, the UMTA decided that Alden was far too small to be able to handle the job, and arranged for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to take over as systems management role, signing a contract with them in December 1970. Boeing Vertol was selected to build the vehicles, Bendix Corporation supplied the control systems, and F.R. Harris Engineering would design and build the guideway, stations, and other facilities. =Construction= The original estimates for the system were $15-20 million. But having set a deadline based on political considerations, rather than technical, the system had to be rushed through to completion as soon as possible. JPL, used to running large engineering projects with a stepped approach, had to abandon the study stage and move the project directly to engineering tests. Numerous problems cropped up as a test system was set up at Boeing's plants, notably the requirement to heat the guideways to melt the snow that collected in the U-shaped guideways, resulting in costly changes to the design. By the time the original deadline passed, the system was already massively over-budget and nowhere near ready for buildout. Instead of a feather in Nixon's cap, the system became a political chess piece and was derided in the press as a white elephant. There were large cost overruns during the development of the system, and it was not until 1974 that the system had matured technically. Construction of the first guideway in Morgantown started that year, and was completed the next. The Phase I system began operations in 1975, with a final cost of $62 million, four times the estimate. It consisted of of guideway, 45 vehicles, 3 stations, and a maintenance/control facility. Service was interrupted during the 1978–1979 school year for a system expansion, dubbed Phase II, during which WVU provided bus service between the campuses. The system was extended from the \\"Engineering\\" station towards new stations at \\"Towers\\" (dormitories) and the WVU Medical Center/Mountaineer Field. Phase II cost $64 million, bringing the total for the entire system to $130 million. Upon its completion, the system had 71 vehicles, of guideway, and 5 stations. One existing station had also been expanded, and a second maintenance facility was added. Although the system's construction ran far over budget, it still proved to be what its designers had claimed: a reliable system of automated transit that was inexpensive to operate. It has offered on-time service rates far better than the bus services it replaced, and eliminated the gridlock that had locked up the city center. Moreover, no injuries were reported for the first 42 years of operation, until the first reported accident in November 2016. From July 2005 to June 2006, about 2.25 million rides were taken on the PRT. As of November 2007, the PRT transports about 16,000 riders per day. The record for most riders in a day is 31,280, set on 21 August 2006. In 2003, about 60% of costs were covered by the 50-cent fares. Morgantown's economy boomed in the 2000s and the city was noted for having the lowest municipal unemployment rate in the U.S. Mayor Ronald Justice said, \\"We're a small town with big traffic issues, and the PRT could be the reason we're able to continue our growth.\\" There are two proposals to extend the line from both ends: one would extend southward to the new commercial and shopping area being developed as part of a riverfront revitalization project, while a longer extension is being considered to the northwest to connect a new research park. If both extensions are completed, at an estimated $30–40 million a mile, the system would almost double in length. PRT guideway and station (background) =Accidents= On 30 November 2016, the system had its first reported accident when two PRT cars were involved in a crash between the Beechurst and Walnut stations. There were six passengers on board and two were treated for minor injuries. Service to Walnut station was suspended for several days while the incident was investigated. On 10 February 2020, two PRT passengers, and WVU students, were taken to Ruby Memorial Hospital for injuries due to a boulder striking a PRT car that dislodged from the nearby hillside. One student on the PRT was seriously injured and suffered multiple pelvic fractures. A driver, on nearby Mon Boulevard, was also taken to the hospital after their vehicle collided with another boulder that was part of the same disturbance. Description =Guideway= The guideway is a dedicated roadway for rubber-tired vehicles that allows close separation between vehicles. It is a network that connects all stations and the maintenance facility. The guideway is used mostly by the PRT vehicles except in an emergency where maintenance workers can drive a car up to tow a non-functioning PRT vehicle off the guideway. The guideway is a concrete structure with about half of its length elevated. It has three-phase 575 VAC, 60-Hz propulsion power rails on the sidewall that are equipped with electric heater for cold weather operations. Below the power rails is a steering rail that allows the guidewheel of PRT vehicles to be pressed against to steer along the guideway. Communication induction loops and guideway heating pipes are located on the road surface. =Vehicles= Interior of a PRT car Passive run~on run-off power collector at the front wheel The system has 73 vehicles that resemble small buses. They are long, high and wide. Weighing , they are powered by a motor that allows them to reach . The vehicles have automatic doors on both sides that open to the platform, and are accessible for people with mobility disabilities. The vehicles are designed for 20 passengers, with four seats arranged in a \\"U\\" on each end and four stanchions in the center of the vehicle for twelve standees. A yearly event called the PRT Cram takes place in which student organizations try to pack as many individuals as possible inside a modified PRT vehicle. The record of 97 was set in 2000. The cars are powered by three-phase 575-volt alternating current rectified to drive a direct current motor. Electric pickups are fixed on both sides of each car, which connect to electrified rails on one, or both, sides of the guideway. The wheels of the vehicles steer slightly toward whichever side is powered to ensure that they stay in firm electrical contact with the rails. Each car has four-wheel steering to help negotiate the tight turns in the PRT guideways, especially around stations. =Route layout= A PRT car in the Medical station A vehicle steers along the main guideway to bypass two vehicle stopped at a station The system connects the university's campuses via five stations (Walnut, Beechurst, Engineering, Towers, Medical) along a route. All stations are on sidings, which allows vehicles to bypass stations. The guideway consists of concrete pathways with magnetic induction loops that provide car location data. The system's concrete pathways have embedded pipes that circulate a glycol solution, which is heated at stations to help melt snow and ice prevalent in Morgantown's snowy winter climate. Most of the system (65%) is built on elevated bridges and viaducts, while the remainder is at or below ground level. The viaduct spans are approximately long, and there are two styles of viaduct, with those constructed in Phase I being noticeably heavier-duty than those built in Phase II. =Modes of operation= The system is fully automated and can operate in three modes: \\"demand\\", \\"schedule\\", and \\"circulation\\". In demand mode, which is used during off-peak hours, the system reacts dynamically to rider requests. After pressing the button to call a car, a timer starts. If the timer reaches a predetermined limit, typically 5 minutes, a vehicle is activated to service the request even if no other passengers have requested the same destination. Also, if the number of passengers waiting to travel to the same destination exceeds a predetermined limit, usually 15, a vehicle is immediately activated. In this mode the system operates as a true PRT. During peak hours, the system switches to schedule mode, which operates the cars on fixed routes of known demand. This lowers the waiting time for a car traveling to a given destination and is more efficient than demand mode. During low-demand periods, the system switches to circulation mode, operating a small number of vehicles that stop at every station, like a bus service. This reduces the number of vehicles traveling on the network. =Performance= In the 2006 fiscal year, the system broke down 259 times for a total of 65 hours and 42 minutes, out of a total of 3,640 hours and 15 minutes scheduled running time, which equates to about 98% availability. Of those 259 breakdowns, 159 were caused by vehicle- related problems. In 2007, the system received funding to improve efficiency by reducing this vehicle downtime. Since the system's completion in 1975, technology for PRTs has advanced considerably, but the control equipment for the Morgantown system changed very little. The control room is said to resemble a NASA mission control room from the 1970s, though the underlying electronics are more modern. , the system's cost per trip is $2.01, the third least expensive (after New York and Boston) for any fixed guideway system in the United States. =Operation hours= Morgantown PRT operates chiefly as transportation for WVU's students and, as such, runs primarily during class days. During the fall and spring semesters, it operates 6:30 am-10:15 pm weekdays and 9:30 am-5:00 pm on Saturdays. It is normally closed on Sundays. During the summer semester, it operates 6:30 am-6:15 pm weekdays and 9:30 am-5:00 pm on Saturdays, and is closed on Sundays. When major WVU eventsnotably football and men's basketball gamesare scheduled to end outside of normal operating hours, the system will run for at least an hour after the end of the event. The system is closed on holidays and during semester breaks. =Modernization= The old on-board vehicle computer system being replaced as part of the Phase 1 modernization project PRT vehicle propulsion system When it opened, the PRT was controlled by DEC PDP-11 computers installed in 1971. Due to difficulty in procuring replacement parts, these older computers were replaced in 1997-1998 with Intel Pentium computers. A 2010 study recommended renewal of the system given declining reliability caused by its age and the lack of access to replacement parts for key components, such as the vehicles and the control system. The report considered replacement of the PRT with buses but concluded they would be unsatisfactory given the extra traffic congestion and poor travel times that would result. By 2015 reliability had fallen to 90%. In 2012, the university Board of Governors approved $15 million as part of renewal and modernization project. The total cost is projected to be $100–$130 million. The three phase plan is to replace the control and propulsion systems in the current vehicles, installation of a new automatic train control system, upgrade the power supply, repairs to the infrastructure and finally replacement of all the vehicles. Part of the phase 1 work to upgrade the vehicles' control and propulsion system was completed by early 2014 and resulted in improved operations. On 29 April 2014, Thales Group was selected by WVU to install its SelTrac Communications-based train control (CBTC) system, as well as new systems for fare collection and passenger information. Upgrades occurred during the summer breaks in 2015 and 2017 while the system is normally closed. Replacement of the train control system will continue during the fall 2017 and spring 2018 semesters in preparation for full-scale testing and commissioning during the summer of 2018. For the vehicle replacement in phase 2, which has not commenced , the university has said it will look for vehicles that weigh , about one-third the for the current fleet. The $52.6 million phase II renovation of the PRT is still being completed. Over the winter break of the 2017-2018 academic year, 11 cars were converted to a new software. The updated cars have not been used during typical business hours as they are not compatible to the current system. In addition to receiving new software, Phase II also includes replacing electric boards and sensors on the guide ways and signs.

It debuted in 1992 with Sim Drive in Japan, followed by a worldwide debut in 1993 with Ridge Racer. The System 22 was designed by Namco with assistance from graphics & simulation company Evans & Sutherland. Graphical features include texture mapping, Gouraud shading, transparency effects, and depth cueing, thanks to the Evans & Sutherland 'TR3' chip/chipset, which stands for: Texture Mapping, Real-Time, Real-Visual, Rendering System. The main CPU provides a scene description to the TR3 graphics processing unit and a bank of DSP chips which perform 3D calculations.

It saw service with the armed forces of the Confederate States of America during the American Civil War of 1861–65 and the Army of the Government of National Defense during the Franco-Prussian War. History and design This unique sidearm was also known as the \\"Grape Shot Revolver.\\" It was developed in New Orleans in 1856 by Jean Alexandre Le Mat, whose manufacturing effort was backed by P. G. T. Beauregard, who became a general in the Confederate States Army. Fewer than 100 were made by John Krider of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1859, including the first 25 prototypes. It is estimated that 2,900 were produced in Liège, Belgium and Paris, France. The European-made pistols were shipped through Birmingham, England, where they were proofmarked. Approximately 900 revolvers were shipped to the Confederate States Army and 600 to the Confederate States Navy through Bermuda to avoid the Southern Naval Blockade. The distinguishing characteristic of LeMat's revolver is that its 9-shot cylinder revolves around a separate central barrel of larger caliber than the chambers in the cylinder proper. The central barrel is smooth-bore and can function as a short-barreled shotgun (hence the name \\"Grape Shot Revolver\\") with the shooter selecting whether to fire from the cylinder or the smooth-bore barrel by flipping a lever on the end of the hammer. Flipping the lever up caused the movable striker to fall upon the primer set directly under the hammer, discharging the lower barrel, while leaving it in the standard position would fire the chambers in the cylinder, much like any other revolver. LeMat originally chambered his pistol for .40 (or .42) caliber revolver bullets, with a .60 (20 gauge) smooth-bore barrel, and had a jointed ramrod (mounted on the right-hand side of the frame), which was used to load both barrels. Later, during the American Civil War, a lighter .35-caliber pistol with a .55 caliber (28-gauge) smooth bore barrel was produced, but as these were non-standard ammunition sizes (.36 or .44 caliber were most common for contemporary revolvers) LeMat owners had to cast their own bullets (as opposed to being issued them from general military stores). The final models of the LeMat were produced in .36 or .44 caliber in response to these criticisms, but too few of them managed to get past the Union blockade of the South during the Civil War to be of any real use. Civil War use LeMat hoped to market his adaptable revolver as a primary sidearm for dragoons and other mounted troops. He entered into a partnership with P. G. T. Beauregard (at that time a major in the U.S. Army) in April 1859 to market his handgun to the U.S. Army. Beauregard, besides being LeMat's cousin, was one of the first U.S. Army officers to resign and join the Confederacy. cap & ball model, used by Confederate States troops in the American Civil War When war broke out, LeMat received Confederate contracts for the production of five thousand revolvers, and plans were laid to manufacture the gun abroad and then import them into the Confederacy, which lacked the necessary facilities to produce the weapon locally. Confederate gun runners were able to slip shipments of the gun through the Union naval blockade and it is estimated that about 2,500 made it into Confederate service. In addition to General Beauregard and Colonel LeMat, LeMat's revolver was used by such famous Confederate officers as Major Generals Braxton Bragg, J. E. B. Stuart, Richard H. Anderson, and Captain Henry Wirz. Confederate Major General J. E. B. Stuart \\"was known to favor the LeMat revolver\\". General Beauregard's personal engraved LeMat, which he carried throughout the war, is preserved at the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia. The LeMat revolver was manufactured from 1856 to 1865, with approximately 2,900 being produced. The first models were manufactured by John Krider of Philadelphia, with the second model (the first overseas model) being produced by Charles Frederic Girard and Son of Paris. Quality concerns prompted LeMat to consider production at the Birmingham Small Arms Company in Birmingham, England, but production was never mounted there. LeMat revolvers from France were shipped to the Confederate States forces via the United Kingdom, and all firearms landed in the UK were (and still are) required to be proofed. The LeMats which found their way through the Union blockade were stamped with British proof marks from the Birmingham Proof House, leading to the misapprehension that the pistols were actually manufactured in the UK. A handful are known to have been made illegitimately in the UK by an unknown manufacturer, believed to be the London Armoury Company, but only two examples survive to the present day and it is doubtful any of the English-made LeMats ever saw service during the U.S. Civil War. The original revolver, constructed of blued steel with grips of checkered walnut, was not considered to be a very accurate weapon although it was deadly at close range. Civil War cavalrymen, particularly in the South, preferred to carry several pistols, as it was faster to draw another loaded weapon than it was to try to reload a cap and ball revolver in combat. After the introduction of cartridge-firing firearms, the LeMat system appeared in pinfire, but this version is exceedingly rare. A centerfire version in 12mm Perrin or 11mm Chamelot-Delvigne, with a 24 gauge shot barrel, was made in later years in Belgium. While having better sales than its pinfire relative, the centerfire LeMat also had no real commercial success due to the invention of the double-action system. With both weapons, loading was accomplished via a loading gate located at the 4 o'clock position for the cylinder, and by swinging the breech of the shot barrel up and left. Variants * Muzzle Loader – The first variant of the LeMat. * Pinfire Cartridge – Second variant, can be recognised by cylinder. * Centerfire – The centerfire variant came with a distinctive grip. * Carbine – A rare variant with extended barrels and a rifle type stock totalling 20\\" in length. * Baby LeMat - The rarest variant of the LeMat is a reduced size version with a 4 3/4\\" barrel and the revolver chambered in .32 caliber and the shotgun chambered in .41 bore. Only 100 were produced. Modern reproductions Modern reproduction of a LeMat cap and ball Revolver. 200px The Pietta company of Brescia, Italy has manufactured modern reproductions of the LeMat revolver since 1985. United States distributors include Navy Arms Company, Dixie Gunworks and Cabela's. Canadian distributors include Marstar Canada, among others.

The objects are described in the Pali Canon and summarized in the famous meditation treatise the Visuddhimagga. List of kasiṇa There are ten kasiṇa described in the Visuddhimagga, which are also mentioned in the Pali Tipitaka:A.v.36, A.v.46-60, M.ii.14; D.iii.268, 290; Nett.89, 112; Dhs.202; Ps.i.6, 95 # earth पठवी कसिण (Pali: paṭhavī kasiṇa, Sanskrit: pṛthivī kṛtsna) # water आपो कसिण (āpo kasiṇa, ap kṛtsna) # fire तेजो कसिण (tejo kasiṇa, tejas kṛtsna) # air, wind वायो कसिण (vāyo kasiṇa, vāyu kṛtsna) # blue, green नील कसिण (nīla kasiṇa, nīla kṛtsna) # yellow पीत कसिण (pīta kasiṇa, pīta kṛtsna) # red लोहित कसिण (lohita kasiṇa, lohita kṛtsna) # white ओदात कसिण (odāta kasiṇa, avadāta kṛtsna) # enclosed space, hole, aperture आकास कसिण (ākāsa kasiṇa, ākāśa kṛtsna) # consciousness विञ्ञाण कसिण (viññāṇa kasiṇa, vijñāna kṛtsna); in the Pali suttas and some other texts; bright light आलोक कसिण āloka kasiṇa according to later sources, such as Buddhaghosa's Visuddhimagga. The kasiṇa are typically described as a colored disk, with the particular color, properties, dimensions and medium often specified according to the type of kasiṇa. The earth kasiṇa, for instance, is a disk in a red-brown color formed by spreading earth or clay (or another medium producing similar color and texture) on a screen of canvas or another backing material. Concentration meditation method Kasiṇa meditation is one of the most common types of samatha meditation, intended to settle the mind of the practitioner and create a foundation for further practices of meditation. In kasiṇa meditation, a mental object (kasina) is used as the object of meditation, being used to keep the mind focused whenever attention drifts. The meditation treatise the Visuddhimagga is centered around kasina-meditation.Bhikkhu Thanissaro, Concentration and Discernment According to American scholar monk Thanissaro Bhikkhu, \\"[t]he text then tries to fit all other meditation methods into the mold of kasina practice, so that they too give rise to countersigns, but even by its own admission, breath meditation does not fit well into the mold.\\" He argues that by emphasizing kasina-meditation, the Visuddhimagga departs from the focus on dhyana in the Pali Canon. Thanissaro Bhikkhu states this indicates that what \\"jhana means in the commentaries is something quite different from what it means in the Canon.\\" Abilities According to scholars, the Visuddhimagga is one of the extremely rare texts within the enormous literatures of various forms of Jainism, Buddhism, and Hinduism to give explicit details about how spiritual masters were thought to actually manifest supernormal abilities. Abilities such as flying through the air, walking through solid obstructions, diving into the ground, walking on water and so forth are performed by changing one element, such as earth, into another element, such as air. The individual must master kasina meditation before this is possible. Dipa Ma, who trained via the Visuddhimagga, was said to demonstrate these abilities. Although practice with kasiṇas is associated with the Theravāda tradition, it appears to have been more widely known among various Buddhist schools in India at one time. Asanga makes reference to kasiṇas in the Samāhitabhūmi section of his Yogācārabhūmi.Buddhist Insight: Essays by Alex Wayman. Motilal Banarsidass: 1984 pg 76  Disciples of the Buddha  Uppalavanna, one of the Buddha's chief female disciples, famously attained arahantship using a fire (tejo) kasina as her object of meditation.

It is located near Rothwell, Oulton, Woodlesford, Mickletown and Allerton Bywater. The Leeds City Ward is called Kippax and Methley. It is within the triangle formed by Leeds, Castleford and Wakefield, and between the confluence of the River Aire and River Calder. The latter is crossed by Methley Bridge, the A639 road, () about a mile south-east of the village. Location and history Mining Memorial, Main Street Today, the village is often described in terms of the area around Church Lane, Main Street and Pinfold Lane. However, the buildings on these streets largely date from the 20th century – and this area does not represent the original geographical centre of the village. The original village was established near to Saint Oswald's Church, and in particular along Church Side. This is reflected in the 17th- and 18th-century buildings along Churchside and parts of Watergate.Leeds City Council (2008) Methley Church Side Conservation Area Appraisal & Management Plan The village has a history of coal mining. At one stage there were five mines in operation in the village – Savile Colliery, Methley Junction, Foxholes (Scholey Hill), Newmarket, and Newmarket Silkstone. The last pit (Saville Colliery) closed in the mid-1980s. Part of the village (the area south and west of the M62 motorway) was ceded to the City of Wakefield Metropolitan district council in the 1990s. This area, which includes the hamlets of Newmarket and Scholey Hill, was subject to a planning dispute regarding an industrial and leisure development as villagers feared increased traffic levels – particularly along the A642, B6135 (Newmarket Lane and Watergate), Park Lane and Churchside. Eric Pickles, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government approved the development on 21 June 2012. The new stadium for Wakefield Trinity Wildcats Rugby league club will form part of the development and should be completed by 2015. Methley was in the wapentake of Agbrigg in the West Riding of Yorkshire in 1086.Open Domesday Online: Methley Methley was surveyed by the Tudor cartographer, Christopher Saxton, author of the first atlas of England (1577). However, the map is now lost. Buildings =Methley Hall= Methley Hall was the former seat of the Earl of Mexborough. During the fourteenth century the de Waterton family married into the de Methley family and moved to Methley Hall, a large, imposing and solid castellated building, mostly spread over three storeys rising to four by the turreted entrance. An eighteenth century watercolour shows a great hall with a minstrels gallery and grand staircase, decorated and embossed ceiling with a full length oriel window. Young Richard Plantagenet, Richard of York, lived here from the ages of four to twelve, with Waterton's family until 1423 when national events changed things. Robert Waterton was the custodian of Richard II whilst constable of Pontefract Castle from 1399 and later gaoler of James I of Scotland. He was esquire to Henry Bolingbroke, the future Henry IV. The seat at Methley Hall was conferred in 1410 to Robert's brother John Waterton. The Hall, which featured in a 1907 edition of Country Life, was demolished in 1964, although the Mexborough Estate are still significant landowners in the district. Queen Mary (Mary of Teck), consort of H. M. King George V, visited the village in 1935 and stayed at the Hall as a guest of the Earl. Titus Salt leased Methley Hall from the Earl of Mexborough between 1856 and 1865 according to Salt's biographer Balgarnie.http://www.methley-village.com/html/titus_salt.html =Church= St Oswald's Church viewed from Church Side The parish church Saint Oswald's is a 14th and 15th century Grade I listed building which had a spire from the mid-18th century to 1937. The spire became unsafe and was dismantled. The Castleford-born artist Henry Moore was a frequent visitor to the church. Nikolaus Pevsner documented the church and Methley Hall as part of his Buildings of England series in the late 1950s. Alan Bennett visited the church in December 1998 as mentioned in his collection of writings Untold Stories (2005), a visit which was filmed as part of a special The South Bank Show charting the writer's early life.Alan Bennett (2006) Untold Stories (Faber & Faber) page 244 =\\"Fatty Cake\\" School House= Former school on Watergate The Old Pinder Green school house is a Grade II listed building dating from 1637 at the junction of Watergate and the main Leeds to Pontefract Road.British Listed Buildings Old Pinder Green School The school closed in 1881 and became a private residence, now known as the Fatty Cake School House.www.rightmove.co.uk 4-bedroom detached house for sale: Fatty Cake School House, Watergate, Methley, Leeds Railway Methley was once served by three railway stations: Methley North (closed 1957); Methley Junction (closed 1943); and Methley South (closed 1960). The original railway line through the village was built by the North Midland Railway in 1840 as part of the Derby to Leeds main line. This route now forms part of the Hallam (Leeds – Sheffield) and Pontefract Lines. The proposed route of the Birmingham to Leeds HS2 rail line passes to the west of the village between Scholey Hill, Clumpcliffe and Lemonroyd Lock, with the high-speed line curving west at that point to take trains into Leeds city centre via Woodlesford. The new line is scheduled to open in 2032. Second World War POW camp Methley was the site of a German POW camp during the Second World War. The camp was located on the north side of Park Lane near to The Lodge. The foundations of the POW huts are still visible on close inspection. POWs were used as agricultural labourers on the Mexborough Estate as many villagers had been recruited into the armed forces. The POWs were invited to perform Stille Nacht, Heilige Nacht (Silent Night) in German during a Christmas Eve service at St Oswald's Church – an event still remembered by some villagers. The BBC Inside Out programme (5 December 2011) reported that Artur Braun, one of the inmates of the POW camp, produced a large painting (size 8 ft x 8 ft) entitled 'Our Lady of the ruins' during the winter of 1944–45. It featured the Madonna with child in a ruined city surrounded by desperate people appealing to God for protection from war. The painting is believed to depict the artist's wife (as the Madonna) in the ruins of the city of Freiburg im Breisgau in Baden-Württemberg, (Germany) (the painting clearly shows Freiburg Munster in the background). Braun may have produced the painting after hearing of the death of his wife during an allied air raid on Freiburg im Breisgau (Braun's home town) during November 1944. For many years the painting was owned by a convent in Lancashire, then was sold at auction in 1997. Local points of interest The Yorkshire Imperial Band, formerly the Yorkshire Imperial Copperworks Band, used to rehearse in the village. The band, who have won the Champions of Great Britain title and three British Open titles, is one of the country's foremost brass bands and have produced recordings and performed concerts on the BBC. The composer Edward Elgar was friends with the former owner (Mr. Embleton) of 'The Cedars' – now a residential home – and often stayed in the village. Nick Hodgson, drummer of the Leeds band the Kaiser Chiefs, has family connections with the village. The band officially opened the new village primary school on 16 January 2006. Other notable residents of the village have included Rugby league players Brian Lockwood, Dean Mountain, Daryl Powell, Ben Crooks, Kelvin Skerrett, Joe Arundel and footballer Paul Rickers. . Each year the village holds a Scarecrow Festival, a competition in which residents take part. Methley Cricket Club won the Village Cup national cricket competition at Lord's, in 1998. Yorkshire player Matthew Waite, has represented Methley C.C. Methley United A.F.C. (formerly Methley Rangers F.C.) are the local football club. The original village football club, was Methley Perseverance F.C.. Methley Warriors A.R.L.F.C and Methley Royals R.L.F.C., are the village Rugby League teams.

The club is named after their neighborhood, which is named after Saint Raymond. Saint Raymond is also the patron saint of the neighborhood of São Raimundo. History In 1915, Risópolis Clube Recreativo was founded by Francisco Rebelo and Professor Assis. On November 18, 1918, the club changed its name to Risófoli Clube Recreativo. In December of the same year the club changed its name to São Raimundo Esporte Clube. In 1956, São Raimundo played for the first time in Campeonato Amazonense First Division. In 1961, the club won their first state championship. From 1999 to 2001, the club won three Copa Norte titles in a row. These were the club's first regional competition titles. In 1999, after finishing second in the Brazilian Série C, São Raimundo earned promotion to the Série B, the second division of Brazilian football. It stayed there until 2006, when São Raimundo were relegated to the Série C following a poor campaign in which the club finished 19th out of 20 clubs.

It is perhaps best known for the diacopic use of the word \\"bells.\\" The poem has four parts to it; each part becomes darker and darker as the poem progresses from \\"the jingling and the tinkling\\" of the bells in part 1 to the \\"moaning and the groaning\\" of the bells in part 4. Analysis This poem can be interpreted in many different ways, the most basic of which is simply a reflection of the sounds that bells can make, and the emotions evoked from that sound. For example, \\"From the bells bells bells bells/Bells bells bells!\\" brings to mind the clamoring of myriad church bells. Several deeper interpretations exist as well. One is that the poem is a representation of life from the nimbleness of youth to the pain of age. Growing despair is emphasized alongside the growing frenzy in the tone of the poem.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York City: Harper Perennial, 1991. p. 403 The sounds of the verses, specifically the repetitive \\"bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells, bells,\\" lie on a narrow line between sense and nonsense, causing a feeling of instability.Rosenheim, Shawn James. The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet. The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997. p. 125. Poe uses the word \\"tintinnabulation\\", apparently a coinage of his own, based on the Latin word for \\"bell\\", tintinnabulum.tintinnabulation, Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version, December 2011; accessed 09 January 2012. Earlier version first published in New English Dictionary, 1912. The series of \\"bells\\" echo the imagined sounds of the various bells, from the silver bells following the klip-klop of the horses, to the \\"dong, ding-dong\\" of the swinging golden and iron bells, to screeching \\"whee-aaah\\" of the brazen bells. The series are always four, followed by three, always beginning and ending on a stressed syllable. The meter changes to iambic in the lines with repeated \\"bells,\\" bringing the reader into their rhythm. Most of the poem is a more hurried trochaic tetrameter.Analysis: Form and Meter. The bells of which he writes are thought to be those he heard from Fordham University's bell tower, since Poe resided in the same neighborhood as that university. He also frequently strolled about Fordham's campus conversing with both the students and the Jesuits. Critical response Richard Wilbur characterized \\"The Bells\\" as \\"altogether a tour de force\\".Wibur, Richard, Poe The Laurel Poetry Series, (New York, 1959), p. 37. Critics have analyzed the musical or sound of the poem as opposed to its literary meaning. A. E. DuBois in \\"The Jazz Bells of Poe\\" places the emphasis on the musical quality of the poem which presages jazz and 20th century musical idioms.DuBois, A.E. \\"The Jazz Bells of Poe,\\" College English, II (December, 1940), 230-244. DuBois sees the poem as a dramatic song that is a precursor for Vachel Lindsay. DuBois makes comparisons to jazz music and places the poem in the style of musical and poetic \\"primativism\\" which was ahead of its time in the 1840s. F. O. Matthiessen rejected the repetitive sounds employed and musical tone as \\"a case of onomatopoeia pushed to a point where it would hardly be possible or desirable to go again\\".Matthiessen, F.O., Literary History of the United States, (New York, 1948), I, 339. Edward H. Davidson, however, praised its use of repetitive sounds: \\"It has been rightly praised for its experimental and effective onomatopoeia; its theme is probably nothing more profound than the four ages of man\\".Davidson, Edward H. Selected Writings of Edgar Allan Poe, (Boston, 1956), p. 498. Poe biographer Jeffrey Meyers noted that \\"The Bells\\" is often criticized for sounding mechanical and forced.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. (Cooper Square Press, 1992.), p. 223. Publication history Title page for publication of \\"The Bells\\" circa 1881. Poe is believed to have written \\"The Bells\\" in May 1848 and submitted it three times to Sartain's Union Magazine, a magazine co-owned by his friend John Sartain, until it was finally accepted.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 25. He was paid fifteen dollars for his work, though it was not published until after his death in the November 1849 issue. It was also published in Horace Greeley's the New York Daily Tribune newspaper on the front page of its October 17, 1849 issue as \\"Poe's Last Poem\\".The New-York Daily Tribune, Wednesday, October 17, 1849, \\"Poe's Last Poem\\", From the Union Magazine for November, front page. Inspiration for the poem is often granted to Marie Louise Shew, a woman who had helped care for Poe's wife Virginia as she lay dying. One day, as Shew was visiting Poe at his cottage in Fordham, New York, Poe needed to write a poem but had no inspiration. Shew allegedly heard ringing bells from afar and playfully suggested to start there, possibly even writing the first line of each stanza.E. A. Poe Society of Baltimore Adaptations Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943) composed a choral symphony The Bells, Op. 35, based on a Russian adaptation of the poem by Konstantin Balmont. The symphony follows classical sonata form: first movement, slow movement, scherzo, and finale, thus honoring the poem's four sections.AmericanSymphony.org (The work is sometimes performed in English, using not Poe's original, but a translation of Balmont's adaptation by Fanny S. Copeland.) The Scottish composer Hugh S. Roberton (1874–1947) published \\"Hear the Tolling of the Bells\\" (1909), \\"The Sledge Bells\\" (1909), and \\"Hear the Sledges with the Bells\\" (1919) based on Poe's poem.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001. p. 212. Josef Holbrooke composed his \\"The Bells, Prelude, Op. 50\\" on Poe's poem, and American folksinger Phil Ochs composed a tune to the poem recorded on his album All the News That's Fit to Sing. Eric Woolfson, musical partner to Alan Parsons in the Alan Parsons Project, has written two albums based on the writings of Poe. His second, Poe: More Tales of Mystery and Imagination includes a song entitled \\"The Bells\\", for which he set Poe's words to music. This album was also the basis for a musical stage production that was performed in England, Austria, and other European countries. Pink Floyd have referenced the poem in the last verse of their song \\"Time\\" on the album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). In 1993 Danish composer Poul Ruders wrote a piece \\"The Bells\\" for high soprano and ten instruments, using Poe's text in its entirety although in Dutch.The New Danes [Streaming Audio]. (n.d.). Bridge. Retrieved October 5, 2014, from Music Online: Classical Music Library. The piece was premiered in London, and has appeared on a CD from Bridge Records, New York.

He was a pupil of Avicenna. As he composed a popular commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates, he was known in some circles as \\"the second Hippocrates\\" (Buqrat al-thani).

On June 18, 1885, the Texarkana and Northern Railway, organized by William. L. Whitaker, a lumberman and railroad contractor in Texarkana, was chartered by the state of Texas, and built a ten-mile line from Texarkana north to Whitaker's timber lands along the Red River. On July 9, 1889, the charter was amended, changing the name to Texarkana and Fort Smith Railway, and granting authority to extend the line all the way to Fort Smith, Arkansas. By 1892, when the T&FS; had built another 16 miles north from the Red River to Wilton, Arkansas, the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad gained control of the railway and set about using the T&FS; as the Texas link in its planned route between Kansas City and the Gulf of Mexico. At that time, Article X of the Texas Constitution required all railroads operating in the state to be headquartered in Texas. By 1897, the T&FS; had extended its rails 85 miles from Wilton north to Mena, Arkansas, as well as 29 miles southward from Texarkana to the Arkansas-Louisiana border, where it joined KCP&G; rails leading to Shreveport. South of Shreveport, the T&FS; also constructed a line from the Louisiana-Texas border on the Sabine River southward to Beaumont and Port Arthur, Texas, a new city created as the marine terminus of the route. The entire KCP&G; route opened from Kansas City to the Gulf on November 1, 1897, with the T&FS; operating 105 miles of the main line in Arkansas and 79 miles in Texas. In the wake of a financial crisis, the KCP&G; was reorganized as the Kansas City Southern Railway on April 1, 1900. In 1934, in a landmark decision, the Supreme Court upheld an Interstate Commerce Commission ruling that overrode the Texas law requiring in-state railroad headquarters.Wikisource:Texas v.

The method has been described since as the ABE process, (Acetone Butanol Ethanol fermentation process), yielding 3 parts of acetone, 6 of butanol, and 1 of ethanol. Acetone was used in the important wartime task of casting cordite. The alcohols were used to produce vehicle fuels and synthetic rubber. Unlike yeast, which can digest only sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide, C. acetobutylicum and other Clostridia can digest whey, sugar, starch, cellulose and perhaps certain types of lignin, yielding butanol, propionic acid, ether, and glycerin. In genetic engineering In 2008, a strain of Escherichia coli was genetically engineered to synthesize butanol; the genes were derived from Clostridium acetobutylicum. In 2013, the first microbial production of short- chain alkanes was reported \\\\- which is a considerable step toward the production of gasoline.

Life and career Goodwin was born in 1794 in the community of Berwick, Massachusetts (which is today known as North Berwick, Maine). He became a merchant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire working in the counting house of Samuel Lord, becoming master and part owner of several ships, and eventually the owner of two railroads, two banks, and a textile factory. In 1827 he married Sarah Parker Rice. Their daughter Susan married admiral George Dewey. The Goodwin mansion has been preserved and is part of the Strawbery Banke Museum complex in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Goodwin was elected a State Representative, running as a Whig, in 1838, 1843, 1844, 1850, 1854, and 1856. In 1856 he ran, and lost, as the last Whig candidate for Governor of New Hampshire. He switched parties, becoming a Republican, and won his bid for governor in 1859, and again in 1860. He was a delegate at large from New Hampshire to the national conventions at which Henry Clay, Zachary Taylor, and Winfield Scott were nominated by the Whigs for the presidency, serving as vice-president of the first two bodies. During his tenure, the New Hampshire legislature did away with the Courts of Common Pleas, transferring their duties to the State Supreme Court. Goodwin supported a legislative resolution opposing the extension of slavery, and an anti- immigrant act aimed at the defining of police courts' powers to suppress \\"intemperance.\\" He also supported efforts to regulate railroads. Goodwin's business interests were heavily interlinked with raw materials, such as cotton, produced by slaves in the Southern States and elsewhere. In May 1861, as the Civil War began, Goodwin responded to the first calls for soldiers by borrowing funds against his own name to equip two regiments. The legislature affirmed the Governor's action when they came into session the following month. He died in Portsmouth. Honors Goodwin Park In 1888, zinc a monument to New Hampshire soldiers and sailors who served in the Civil War was dedicated in a new park. The park was named Goodwin Park in honor of Goodwin's service during the war. The park and statue were located across from the Goodwin family mansion on Islington Street. In 1963 the Goodwin Mansion, facing demolition, was relocated from Islington Street to Strawbery Banke for preservation. In 1970 the house was formally deeded to Strawbery Banke by the State of New Hampshire.

The institute's name comes from the Greek word eleutheros, meaning \\"freedom and equality.\\" The school admitted students without regard to ethnicity or gender, including freed and fugitive slaves. Its first classes began offering secondary school instruction on November 27, 1848. The school was renamed Eleutherian College in 1854, when it began offering college-level coursework. It is the second college in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains and the first in Indiana to provide interracial education. The restored three-story stone chapel and classroom building was constructed between 1853 and 1856 and presently serves as a local history museum. In the decade before the American Civil War, African-American students comprised approximately one quarter to one third of the institute's total enrollment, with its peak years between 1855 and 1861. At one time during this period its enrollment reached 150 students; however, attendance soon declined and no black students were enrolled at the school after 1861. During the Civil War the college's grounds were used for military training and its main building were used for meetings and concerts. The college closed in 1874, but the main building was used as a private high school and teachers' training school until 1887, when the Lancaster township trustees purchased the building for use as a public school, which closed in 1938. Historic Madison, a Jefferson County preservation organization, received the school as a gift in 1973 and sold it to its present owners in 1990. The new owners formed Historic Eleutherian College Inc., a non-profit group, in 1996. The main building has been restored to reflect an 1850s-era appearance. History Reverend Thomas Craven, a visiting Baptist minister who studied at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, is credited with proposing the idea for the school. He was also an abolitionist and an early advocate of an integrated educational system. Following his advice, several members of Neil's Creek Abolitionist Baptist Church established the Eleutherian Institute, its initial name, at Lancaster, Indiana, in 1848. Much of the initial organizing done by the extended Hoyt- Whipple family.Lyman Hoyt married Asenath Whipple Hoyt, the niece of William Whipple, who was a signer of the U.S. Declaration of Independence. Asenath's sister, Lucy Whipple Nelson, was a strong abolitionist and encouraged Lyman and Asenath to move to Lancaster, Indiana. Walter Hoyt, Lyman's brother, and their brother, Benajah, soon followed. The Hoyts became involved in the Neil's Creek Church. Lyman Hoyt also became a well-known \\"conductor\\" on the Underground Railroad, providing shelter and supplies to runaway slaves. From the 1830s to the 1860s the unincorporated community of Lancaster, about northwest of Madison in Jefferson County, Indiana, was known for its anti- slavery sentiment. Some members of the local community established the Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society in 1839 and the Neil's Creek Abolitionist Baptist Church in 1846. Neil's Creek was located about west of Lancaster, a major stop for fugitive slaves along the Underground Railroad route as they traveled north from Madison on the Ohio River to Indianapolis, Indiana. Several abolitionist families in the area, including some members of the school's board of trustees, were active participants in the Underground Railroad.Three of the college's trustees whose names were linked to the Underground Railroad were Samuel Tibbets, Lyman Hoyt, and James Nelson. See \\"Eleutherian College Classroom and Chapel Building, \\" in Aboard the Underground Railroad, National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. The community's abolitionist church and anti-slavery sentiments also made Lancaster a good place to establish an integrated school. Eleutherian Institute admitted students without regard to ethnicity or gender, including freed and fugitive slaves. and The institute's name comes from the Greek word eleutheros, meaning \\"freedom and equality\\". Its first classes began offering secondary school instruction on November 27, 1848, with fifteen students gathering in an old meetinghouse near Lancaster.Thompson, p. 125. Reverend John G. Craven, the son of Reverend Thomas Craven, served as the school's first teacher. John C. Thompson, Thomas Craven's son-in-law, served as a teacher for the first year, but he returned to Ohio when the school was unable to financially support two teachers. Reverend John Craven was principal of the school until 1861, then moved to Minnesota. James and Lucy Nelson maintained the school's dormitory in the days before the American Civil War.Thompson, pp. 111 and 113. Reverend Thomas Craven donated the land for the school's campus at Lancaster, where two new building were erected atop College Hill in the 1850s, a dormitory, circa 1854, and the stone chapel and classroom building, which was constructed between 1854 and 1856. A log cabin on the property once served as John Craven's home, but no longer exists. In addition to donating land, Reverend Thomas Craven also solicited funds to support the school and recruited students to increase its enrollment.Reverend Thomas Craven relocated to Lancaster in 1854, when construction began on the main classroom building. He died on August 21, 1860, and is buried in the College Hill cemetery at Lancaster. See Thomopson, pp. 110–12 and 126–28. Note: This includes And accompanying photographs. The institute was renamed Eleutherian College in 1854, when it began offering college-level coursework, making it the second colleg in the United States west of the Allegheny Mountains (Oberlin College was first) and the first in Indiana to provide interracial education. In the decade prior to the Civil War, African-American students comprised approximately one quarter to one third of its total enrollment, although enrollment of black students was never large. Some of its African-American students came from as far south as New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi, but most of them came from Kentucky. The school's peak years were 1855 to 1861. At one time during this period its enrollment reached 150 students.Thompson, pp. 113 and 116. Some sources indicate that by 1860 the college enrolled 200 students, including 50 African Americans, some of whom had come from the Deep South despite fugitive slave laws and an amendment to the state constitution prohibited African-American migration into the state. Overall enrollment declined to 112 students in 1857—58 and dropped to 109 students in 1859, including 18 African-American students, 10 of whom were born into slavery. In 1860, two hundred students were enrolled, 50 of them African- American. No black students were enrolled at the school after 1861.Thompson, pp. 119, 126, and 127. During the Civil War, some of the school's former students who enlisted in the 6th Indiana Infantry Regiment participated in the military training held on the Eleutherian College's grounds. In addition, the college's buildings were used for meetings and concerts during the war.Thompson, p. 117. After John Craven left the school in 1861, William Brand served as its principal until 1866,Thompson, p. 116. followed by several successors. The college closed in 1874; however, John Craven returned to the school in 1878 to help revive it as a private high school and teachers' training school. Craven stayed at the school until 1887. Lancaster township trustees purchased the main classroom and chapel building in 1888 for use as a public school. It finally closed in 1938, after the township schools were consolidated, and the building was eventually abandoned. Subsequent owners were unsuccessful in efforts to have the Indiana Department of Conservation convert the property to a state park. =Preservation and restoration= Restoration of the college's main building began in the 1960s. Historic Madison, a Jefferson County preservation organization, received the school as a gift in 1973, but sold it in 1990. The new owners formed Historic Eleutherian College Incorporated, a non-profit organization, in 1996. The chapel and classroom building has been restored to \\"an 1850s-era appearance.\\" Historic Eleutherian College operates the building as a local history museum. Description Reverend Thomas Craven donated the land for the school, which eventually included two new buildings erected on the College Hill property in the 1850s. The main building housed a chapel and classrooms; a second building served as a dormitory. Both buildings were constructed of rough-cut limestone from nearby quarries. The two-story dormitory, circa 1854, had fifteen rooms. The three-story main building, completed in 1856, included a chapel and seven more rooms. The main building measures by . Its classroom spaces were capable of accommodating 200 to 300 students. The dormitory/boardinghouse located near the main school building measures by .Thompson, p. 127. =Exterior= The main building was constructed between 1854 and 1856 in the Greek Revival style. The three-story building has a rectangular plan that includes a square bell tower (belfry) centered above a gable-fronted main entrance. The gable roof includes a triangular-shaped wood pediment above the third-floor windows. The building's windowsills, lintels, and corner quoins are finished limestone, which contrasts to the rough-hewn stone walls. The north (front) facade of the building has three bays wide with two wooden doors flanking a single, ground- floor window. East and west facades are identical, with four double-height windows below four more on the third level. The south (rear) facade has two windows at the third-floor level. =Interior= The main building has a small entryway leading to a two-story chapel that runs the length of the building. The chapel includes double-height windows and a balcony, which crosses the north side of the room. The chapel ceiling is covered in wood panels. Stairs at each end of the entry hall lead to the upper floors. The second story includes two classrooms above the entryway and five additional rooms on the third floor. Stairs in one of the third-floor rooms leads to an unfinished attic. A ladder in the attic leads to the belfry tower. The cast bell was manufactured by J.A. Kelley of Franklin Brass Bell Factory, Madison, Indiana. Recognition The restored main building (classroom and chapel), now a public museum, was listed on the National Register in 1993 and declared a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1997. The National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, also lists the building as a Network to Freedom Site. In 2004 the Indiana Historical Bureau installed a state historical marker at the college to honor its role as one of the earliest educational institutions in the state to enroll students of all ethnicities and genders. Notable alumni Among the school's most notable African- American students was Moses Broyles, who became pastor of the Second Baptist Church in Indianapolis and an organizer of the Indiana Association of Black Baptists Churches in 1858. Broyles was a slave from Kentucky who purchased his freedom as an adult.Thompson, p. 113. Notable female students included Sarah B. Hoyt, who also studied at Oberlin College. She became a teacher and later served as a high school principal at Newport, Kentucky. Rebecca J. Thompson, who completed studies at the Young Ladies Institute, which later became Shepardson College in Granville, Ohio, was chair of the mathematics department at Franklin College (Indiana) for thirty-eight years. She retired from Franklin College in 1910.Thompson, p. 119.

Historically, the region was populated by Sarmatians, Gepids, Huns, Avars and Slavs. The first written record of Novi Kneževac was made in the 9th century, mentioning under the name \\"Kneža\\". In the next century, it was mentioned as \\"Kanjiša\\". Until the arrival of the Ottomans, it was under the administration of Hungarian feudal landlords. In the 16th century, during the Ottoman administration, it was populated by Serbs, its name became known as \\"Turska Kanjiža\\" and there were already 30-40 houses in the settlement at the beginning of the 18th century In the 18th century, it became part of the Habsburg Monarchy, and in 1752, in the vicinity of Turska Kanjiža, a new settlement was built by Serbs coming from Pomorišje, who settled here after the Military Frontier had been abolished in that region.Dr Slobodan Ćurčić, Naselja Banata - geografske karakteristike, Novi Sad, 2004, page 209. The name of the newly built settlement in the neighborhood was Jozefovo or Jozefsdorf (later known as Obilićevo) and in 1945, the two settlements became one. In the 18th century, the economic and cultural life of Turska Kanjiža started thriving; Marko Servijski founded an association whose name was \\"Stipendarius Servijski\\" or \\"Platoneum\\", which was the largest stipendist foundation among Serbs and Cincars at that time. By this association, a regular allowance was allocated to the reformer of the Serbian language, Lukijan Mušicki. In 1885, a pontoon bridge was opened between Turska Kanjiža and Stara Kanjiža. In the 18th century, both settlements, Turska Kanjiža and Jozefovo were populated mainly by Serbs, however, 1910 census already recorded that the Hungarian speakers exceeded in number the Serbian ones in both settlements. As for the territory of present-day Novi Kneževac municipality, 1910 census recorded 18,513 inhabitants in the area, of which 9,295 (50.21%) spoke Serbian and 8,823 (47.66%) Hungarian (Note that this data is calculated on the present-day territory of Novi Kneževac municipality, not on the territory of historical municipality, which included a much larger territory than the modern one in 1910 and in which the Hungarian speakers were more numerous than the Serbian ones). In 1918, it became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). In 1922, the name \\"Nova Kanjiža\\" was officially adopted which was altered to \\"Novi Kneževac\\" in 1935 and in 1932, it was the site of the first football match illuminated by electric lanterns in Yugoslavia.Source: Stevan Kovačević, Gradovi Srbije u slici i reči, Beograd, 2010. Until 1981, the largest ethnic group in the town were Hungarians but with a different demographic trend. The proportion of Serbs increased, while the proportion of Hungarians fell, and in 1981 evinced by all the following censuses, Serbs became the most numerous ethnic group. Nonetheless, there has been a permanent ethnic Serb majority in the territory of present-day Novi Kneževac municipality for several centuries. Inhabited places The Novi Kneževac municipality includes the town of Novi Kneževac, which is situated along the river bank of Tisa, and eight villages. The villages are: *Banatsko Aranđelovo *Đala *Filić *Majdan (Hungarian: Magyarmajdány) *Podlokanj *Rabe (Hungarian: Rábé) *Siget *Srpski Krstur Note: The Hungarian names are also mentioned at those places where there is a Hungarian ethnic majority.

Apropos of the solar eclipse of 829, Habash gives us the first instance of a determination of time by an altitude (in this case, of the sun); a method which was generally adopted by Muslim astronomers. In 830, he seems to have introduced the notion of \\"shadow\\", umbra (versa), equivalent to our tangent in trigonometry, and he compiled a table of such shadows which seems to be the earliest of its kind.

Right: with fill flash Fill flash is a photographic technique used to brighten deep shadow areas, typically outdoors on sunny days, though the technique is useful any time the background is significantly brighter than the subject of the photograph, particularly in backlit subjects. To use fill flash, the aperture and shutter speed are adjusted to correctly expose the background, and the flash is fired to lighten the foreground. Most point and shoot cameras include a fill flash mode that forces the flash to fire, even in bright light. Depending on the distance to the subject, using the full power of the flash may greatly overexpose the subject especially at close range. Certain cameras allow the level of flash to be manually adjusted e.g. 1/3, 1/2, or 1/8 power, so that both the foreground and background are correctly exposed, or allow an automatic flash exposure compensation. Pros and cons of near-axis fill flash The advantage of using a fill flash located near the lens axis is \\"normalizing\\" exposure in situations like backlighting which exceed the ability of the camera to handle the contrast of the lighting. The disadvantage is the same one seen in indoor near-axis flash shots; a lack of directional modeling clues. Near-axis flash indoors and outdoors looks unnatural because natural light comes from overhead putting specular highlights higher on round surfaces like cheeks and creates downward and sideways shadow clues which, combined, help the brain interpret the 3D shape of objects in 2D photographs. More natural looking single flash results can be obtained by raising the flash vertically to create a more natural downward angle, but keeping it centered. This is usually preferable when photographing people because it hides most of the shadows, especially the very distracting nose shadow. In this case the shadow is mostly hidden down below the nose and not noticed. The reason for not moving a single flash off axis sideways rather than vertically is that any shadows the flash creates will be unfilled, dark and potentially unflattering if poorly placed on a subject's face. Bouncing a flash from a surface above the subject, such as a ceiling, creates the same downward modeling direction but isn't a strategy which can be used outdoors. When the flash is moved off-axis or bounced to create directional modeling its role changes from \\"fill\\" to that of \\"key\\" light. Overlapping flash on sunlit faces Faces oriented towards the sun at midday will usually have dark shadows in the eye sockets due to the steep downward angle of the sun and the preference of the subjects not to be blinded by the sun. When near-axis fill flash is added in that situation it hits the shaded eyes and sunlit face equally so the eyes will always remain darker than the face. What happens on a cause and effect level is the flash acts like fill and more key light where it overlaps. The eyes will seem brighter due to the addition of catchlight reflections from the flash but they will still look dull and lifeless. So while near axis fill works in the technical sense and works fine for general candid shooting it isn't the ideal strategy for a close-up portrait were the eyes are a more critical focal point. The more ideal strategy for portraits is open shade or backlit which allows the subject to raise their face and eyes into the skylight without squinting. Flash could make the shadows darker In sunny backlight the problem is more contrast than the camera can handle. But on an overcast day the problem is a lack of contrast. In overcast conditions adding flash will have the net effect of making the shadows darker. Even if the flash is near-axis fill flash it will fall off front-to-back more rapidly than the natural lighting and increase contrast. If moved off axis the flash becomes a \\"key\\" light and can be used to create a higher contrast directional lighting pattern on the face. The greater the amount of off-axis flash added, the darker the shadows will become after exposure is adjusted for normal looking highlights.

Matthew Scudder and the gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. Block was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America in 1994. Early life Lawrence Block was born June 24, 1938Rippetoe, Rita Elizabeth (July 23, 2004). Booze and the Private Eye: Alcohol in the Hard-Boiled Novel. McFarland & Company, p. 130. Archived at Google Books. Retrieved June 18, 2018. in Buffalo, New York, where he was raised. Block attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, but left before graduating. Career Block's earliest work, published pseudonymously in the 1950s, was mostly in the soft-porn mass market paperback industry, an apprenticeship he shared with fellow mystery author Donald E. Westlake. Block describes the early sex novels as a valuable experience, noting that despite the titillating content of the books (rather mild by later standards of adult fiction) he was expected to write fully developed novels with plausible plots, characters and conflicts. He further credits the softcore novels as a factor in his prolific output; writing 15 to 20 sex novels per year to support himself financially, Block was forced to learn to write in a manner that required little revision and editing of his first drafts.Block, Lawrence (1979). Writing the Novel: From Plot to Print, Writer's Digest Books His first novel was a lesbian fiction titled Strange Are The Ways of Love, written under the name Lesley Evans. In 2016, Block reissued this novel with a new title Shadows, under another of his pseudonyms, Jill Emerson. The first of his work to appear under his own name was the 1957 story \\"You Can't Lose,\\" for the crime/adventure magazine Manhunt. The first novel to be published under Block's name was Grifter's Game (1961). It started as an erotic novel but, as Block would later write, \\"I decided it might be a cut above what I’d been writing, so I wrote it as a crime novel with the hope it might work for Gold Medal.\\"Lawrence Block (2013), Afterward to Grifter's Game e-book; LawrenceBlock.com, accessed 13 Feb 2018 He has since published more than fifty novels and more than a hundred short stories, as well as a series of books for writers. Block has lived in New York City for decades, setting most of his fiction there, and has come to be very closely associated with the city. He is married to Lynne Block. He has three daughters, Amy Reichel, Jill Block and Alison Pouliot, from an earlier marriage. With Lynne, he spends much of his time traveling (the two have been to 135 countries), but continues to consider New York his home. He was a regular guest on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson (2005-2015), appearing in eight of Ferguson's ten seasons as host of the program. Considerable autobiographical information on the earlier phase of his life and career may be found scattered through Telling Lies for Fun and Profit (1981), a collection of his fiction columns from Writer's Digest. In 2005 he was honored with the Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award. Block is an alumnus of the Ragdale Foundation. =Recurring characters= Matthew Scudder Block's most famous creation, the ever-evolving Matthew Scudder, was introduced in 1976's The Sins of the Fathers as an alcoholic ex-cop working as an unlicensed private investigator in Hell's Kitchen. Originally published as paperbacks, the early novels are in many ways interchangeable; the second and third entries—In the Midst of Death (1976) and Time to Murder and Create (1977)—were written in the opposite order from their publication dates. 1982's 8 Million Ways to Die (filmed in 1986 by Hal Ashby, with unpopular results) breaks from that trend, concluding with Scudder introducing himself at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. The series was set to end on that note, but an idle promise Block had made to supply an editor friend with an original Scudder short resulted in \\"By the Dawn's Early Light\\", a story set during the character's drinking days, but told from the perspective of a recovering alcoholic. Block expanded on that with 1986's When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (named for a line in a song by folk singer Dave Van Ronk, a close friend), which proved not only one of the more literary entries, but also a favorite of the author and his fans. From then on, Scudder's circumstances rarely remain the same from one book to the next; 1990's A Ticket to the Boneyard, for example, reunites him with Elaine Mardell, a hooker from his days on the force, whom he marries several books later. Other fan favorites are 1991's taut, gruesome A Dance at the Slaughterhouse (winner of the Edgar Award for Best [mystery] Novel), and 1993's A Long Line of Dead Men, a tightly plotted puzzler featuring a rapidly dwindling fraternity known as the \\"Club of 31\\". A Walk Among the Tombstones, published in 1992, was made into a film, released in 2014, written and directed by Scott Frank, with Liam Neeson playing the lead role. The seventeenth entry, A Drop of the Hard Stuff was published in May, 2011. It has been suggested that Scudder's struggle with alcoholism is in part autobiographical; while Block has repeatedly refused to discuss the subject, citing AA's own tradition of anonymity, in a column he wrote for Writer's Digest, Block wrote that when he created Scudder, \\"I let him hang out in the same saloon where I spent a great deal of my own time. I was drinking pretty heavily around that time, and I made him a pretty heavy drinker, too. I drank whiskey, sometimes mixing it with coffee. So did Scudder.\\" Bernie Rhodenbarr Block's other major series, humorous and much lighter in tone, relates the misadventures of gentleman burglar Bernie Rhodenbarr. The series is rich in sophisticated, witty dialogue. Unlike Scudder, Rhodenbarr is ageless, remaining essentially the same from 1977's Burglars Can't Be Choosers, to the eleventh and most recent entry, 2013's The Burglar Who Counted the Spoons. The only significant advancements come in the third volume, The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling (1979, winner of the first annual Nero Award) which sees Bernie having used the spoils from his previous caper to buy a bookstore, and introduces Carolyn Kaiser, his lesbian \\"soulmate\\" and partner in crime. The plots run very much to form: Bernie breaks into a residence (usually on Manhattan's Upper East Side) and, through a series of implausible events, becomes involved in a murder investigation—often as the prime suspect. Not even an eleven-year hiatus (between 1983's The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian and 1994's The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams) would see that basic formula change. There is, however, a meta quality to the more recent entries: Bernie, the reluctant detective, is himself a bookseller and genre fan, and is apt to make references to Agatha Christie, E.W. Hornung (his cat is named \\"Raffles\\"), Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, Sue Grafton and John Sandford, among others. The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart (1995) exploits this to full effect: set during a Humphrey Bogart film festival, the story is itself inspired by many of the actor's most famous roles. The Burglar in the Library (1997) similarly imagines a meeting between Hammet and Chandler at a New England inn in the 1940s, casting a volume inscribed by Chandler to Hammett as its own Maltese Falcon. In The Burglar in the Rye, Bernie helps track down a writer clearly based on J.D. Salinger. The second novel, The Burglar in The Closet was filmed in 1987 as Burglar, with Whoopi Goldberg as Bernie (or Bernice). Evan Michael Tanner Besides Scudder and Rhodenbarr, Block has written eight novels about Evan Tanner, an adventurer and accidental revolutionary who, as a result of an injury sustained in the Korean War, cannot sleep. All but the last of these were published in the 1960s and early 1970s (beginning with 1966's The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep), while the most recent, 1998's Tanner on Ice, revived the character after nearly a thirty-year hiatus. Chip Harrison Chip Harrison, running on the twin engines of lust and curiosity, originally appeared in two funny, non-mystery novels which revolved around seventeen-year-old Chip's obsessive quest to lose his virginity: No Score and Chip Harrison Scores Again. Realizing the series didn't have much of a future once Chip reached his goal, Block puts Chip to work as an assistant to Leo Haig, an admirer of sleuth Nero Wolfe who models himself after his hero (e.g., Wolfe raises tropical flowers, Haig raises tropical fish). They appeared in two subsequent, decidedly tongue-in-cheek mystery novels: Make Out With Murder and The Topless Tulip Caper, and a handful of short stories. Keller Four episodic novels (Hit Man (1998), Hit List (2000), Hit Parade (2006) and Hit Me (2013)) as well as one full- length novel (Hit and Run (2008)) chronicle the life of Keller, a lonely, wistful hitman who originally appeared as a semi-regular feature in Playboy magazine in the 1990s. Most of the novels are fix-ups of related short stories; Hit and Run is the only Keller novel conceived of and written as a single story. In 2016, a new novella was published Keller's Fedora, in which Keller is persuaded to come out of retirement for one last job. Keller's full name is John Paul Keller (a fact mentioned in Hit Man), although he is rarely called anything but Keller in the series. The stories are rarely action- oriented or focused on the details of his crimes, instead being character studies of Keller's personality and the people he meets (e.g., Keller's being hired to kill a major league baseball designated hitter but postponing the act and following the team to away games so the hitter can reach the career milestone of 400 home runs). Originally based in New York City, after a disastrous hit gone wrong he later relocates to New Orleans where he lives under the name \\"Nicholas Edwards\\" and marries, has a child and works in construction. Keller receives assignments via a contact named Dot, who is originally based in White Plains. His assignments usually take him to different cities, where he often envisions himself retiring from the business, daydreaming about settling there, before finishing off the assignment and returning, his fantasies forgotten as a passing dream. Keller's unlikely pastime is stamp collecting, to which he is nearly obsessively devoted. He collects non-U.S. issues, prior to 1940, with a particular interest in stamps from Former colonies of the French Empire. Hit and Run was nominated for The CWA Gold Dagger at the 2009 Crime Thriller Awards. =Other works= Small Town (2003), Block's first non-series book in fifteen years, details a group of New Yorkers' varying responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Block has also written dozens of short stories over the years, and he is the only four-time winner of the Edgar Award for Best Short Story. The 2002 collection Enough Rope compiles stories, 84 in all, from earlier collections, such as Like a Lamb to Slaughter and Sometimes They Bite, along with new and previously uncollected stories. Block describes series character Martin H. Ehrengraf as a dapper little criminal defense lawyer whose clients all turn out to be innocent. Ehrengraf charges a mere $1 retainer fee and afterwards works on contingency; he gets paid a massive fee if and only if his clients are cleared of wrongdoing. When his clients are cleared, it's because Ehrengraf has committed misdeeds up to and including murder to exonerate his client and often frame another for the crimes. The first short story featuring Ehrengraf, “The Ehrengraf Defense,” was published in Ellery Queen’s Mystery Magazine in 1978. By 2003, twelve stories had been published and in 2012 Block completed an eleventh story, “The Ehrengraf Settlement.” All eleven were collected and published in an eVolume, Ehrengraf For The Defense (2012). In addition to writing the scripts for a handful of television episodes over the years—including, in 2005, two episodes of the ESPN series Tilt—Block co-wrote the screenplay for My Blueberry Nights, a 2007 film directed by Wong Kar-wai and starring Norah Jones.\\"A Hodge-Podge of Homicide\\" by OTTO PENZLER, The New York Sun, June 13, 2007, accessed June 13, 2007 Selected bibliography =Matthew Scudder novels= #The Sins of the Fathers (1976) #Time to Murder and Create (1976) #In the Midst of Death (1976) #A Stab in the Dark (1981) #Eight Million Ways to Die (1982) #When the Sacred Ginmill Closes (1986) #Out on the Cutting Edge (1989) #A Ticket to the Boneyard (1990) #A Dance at the Slaughterhouse (1991) #A Walk Among the Tombstones (1992) #The Devil Knows You're Dead (1993) #A Long Line of Dead Men (1994) #Even the Wicked (1997) #Everybody Dies (1998) #Hope to Die (2001) #All the Flowers Are Dying (2005) #A Drop of the Hard Stuff (2011) #The Night and the Music (2013) (A collection of Matthew Scudder short stories and novelettes, 11 in total) #A Time to Scatter Stones (2019) (Novella) =Bernie Rhodenbarr novels= #Burglars Can't Be Choosers (1977) #The Burglar in the Closet (1978) #The Burglar Who Liked to Quote Kipling (1979) #The Burglar Who Studied Spinoza (1980) #The Burglar Who Painted Like Mondrian (1983) #The Burglar Who Traded Ted Williams (1994) #The Burglar Who Thought He Was Bogart (1995) #The Burglar in the Library (1997) #The Burglar in the Rye (1999) #The Burglar on the Prowl (2004) #The Burglar Who Counted the Spoons (2013) There are also three Bernie Rhodenbarr short stories: \\"Like a Thief in the Night\\" (Cosmopolitan, May 1983), \\"The Burglar Who Dropped In On Elvis\\" (Playboy, April 1990), and \\"The Burglar Who Smelled Smoke\\" (Mary Higgins Clark Mystery Magazine, Summer/Fall 1997).

It consists of seven species: C. albertensis, C. ambulator, C. gigas, C. laramiensis, C. lindoei, C. natator, and C. tenuis.Matsumoto, R., & Evans, S. E. (2016). Morphology and function of the palatal dentition in Choristodera. Journal of anatomy, 228(3), 414-429. The name Champsosaurus is thought to come from χαμψαι [champsai] (said in an Ancient Greek source to be an Egyptian word for \\"crocodiles\\"), and σαύρος [sauros] (Greek for \\"lizard\\"). The largest species, C. gigas, grew to 3–3.5 m (10–12 ft) in length. Discovery Its fossils have been found in North America (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, New Mexico, Texas,Lehman, T.M., and Barnes, K., 2010, Champsosaurus (Diapsida: Choristodera) from the Paleocene of West Texas: paleoclimatic implications: Journal of Paleontology, v. 84, p. 341-345. Retrieved 20 September 2010. Colorado, and Wyoming) and Europe (Belgium and France), dating from the Upper Cretaceous to the mid Eocene. Champsosaurus remains have also been found in the Hell Creek Formation, although most of these remains consist of isolated, fragmented postcranial elements. Neonate sized Champsosaurus have been documented in the scientific literature.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

It probably swam with lateral body movements, pinning its limbs against its body to increase its streamline, just like crocodiles and the marine iguana. Behind the eyes, Champsosaurus's skull was very wide, where powerful jaw muscles were attached. Due to specializations in hip and limb anatomy, only females could come ashore to lay eggs, while males primarily lived in water.Yoshihiro Katsura, Fusion of sacrals and anatomy in Champsosaurus (Diapsida, Choristodera), doi:10.1080/08912960701374659 = Anatomy = A skeleton of Champsosaurus reveals a flattened skull in the dorsoventral region, implicating adaptions to aquatic life. The skeleton featured a well-developed, intact secondary palate. Additionally, Champsosaurus is thought to have had a relatively rigid ribcage given the presence of a complete post-cranial skeleton. Internal dermal bones (gastralia) function with this ribcage to regulate the volume of the pleural cavity, effectively controlling the animal's center of gravity for underwater motion. ERICKSON, B. R. (1985). ASPECTS OF SOME ANATOMICAL STRUCTURES OF CHAMPSOSAURUS (REPTILIA: EOSUCHIA). JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY, 5(2), 111-127. Champsosaurus, like many of its fellow neochoristoderes, features teeth with striated enamel of the tooth crown with enamel infolding at the base. Anterior teeth are typically sharper and more slender than posterior segments.  Ear bones  Endocast studies on Champsosaurus suggest that the ear bones were internal and located near the base of the skull. They are functionally most comparable to those of turtles and other aquatic reptiles, and seem more similar to those of archosauromorphs.https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/6208eb7f-08f0-42a9-9a09-6d96779836fb/etd_pdf/bf6cdd9410c74730ae7c6029e7acbc5d/dudgeon- theinternalcranialanatomyofchampsosauruslindoei.pdf  Sexual dimorphism  Previously, two species of Champsosaurus were identified from the Tullock formation in Montana, USA. Because of their nesting behavior on land, it is believed that female champsosaurs were better adapted to terrestrial life, and this is seen in limb morphology between males and females. Sacral fusion is featured in discovered specimens, with of without deformations alike.KATSURA, Y. (2004). SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN CHAMPSOSAURUS (DIAPSIDA, CHORISTODERA). LETHAIA, 37(3), 245-253. The existence of a non-deformational development of sacral fusion, coupled with the presence of more robust limb bones in some discovered individuals is thought to be a result of specific variation, in which said limbs belong to females. KATSURA, Y. (2007). FUSION OF SACRALS AND ANATOMY IN CHAMPSOSAURUS (DIAPSIDA, CHORISTODERA). HISTORICAL BIOLOGY, 19(3), 263-271.  Metabolism  Nasal conchae have in found in neochoristoderes, suggesting that they were capable of regulating their body temperature to some extent. This is particularly relevant given the presence on Champsosaurus in the High Arctic and other cold regions.https://curve.carleton.ca/system/files/etd/6208eb7f-08f0-42a9-9a09-6d96779836fb/etd_pdf/bf6cdd9410c74730ae7c6029e7acbc5d/dudgeon- theinternalcranialanatomyofchampsosauruslindoei.pdf Due to a Paleocene occurrence of these species, there was a southward shift over 10° latitude which following, decreased annual temperature. Since the Champsosaurus species were able to withstand areas of low temperatures and were shown to reach a latitudinal range even into the High Arctic region, this caused this species to greatly surpass its close relative, the crocodilian species, which became one of the instances for which distinguished the both.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 17, 1999. When Homer, Barney, Lenny, and Carl drunkenly vandalize Springfield Elementary School, it is blamed on the children of Springfield, prompting Chief Wiggum to impose a curfew. The children respond by setting up a pirate radio show in which they reveal the embarrassing secrets of Springfield's adults. The episode was written by Larry Doyle and directed by Mark Ervin. The concept behind the episode originates from show producer Mike Scully always wanting to do an episode where the children would be subject to a curfew. The episode received an 8.9 Nielsen rating, and mostly positive reviews from critics. Plot The Simpsons are at Springfield War Memorial Stadium, watching the Springfield Isotopes baseball game. After the first pitch, Homer becomes disappointed by the poor performance of the Isotopes and goes to wait in his car. The game picks up heavily as the Isotopes and the rival team are deadlocked into a final showdown. Six months later, he enters Moe's Tavern and is informed by Lenny and Carl that the Isotopes are in the playoffs, and have so far been playing well. Homer quickly joins in with the fans to support the Isotopes, who end up winning the pennant. To celebrate, Homer, Lenny, Carl, and Barney go on a drunken ranging rampage and accidentally vandalize Springfield Elementary School. The next morning, Homer discovers his now badly damaged car, making him oblivious that in reality he and his friends were responsible. Chief Wiggum blindly jumps to the conclusion that the vandalism at the school is the work of Bart and Lisa and their friends, who are all kids, and immediately enforces a curfew on all of Springfield's children, prohibiting them from being on the local streets and roads after dark. However, every child of Springfield is annoyed with not being allowed out after the sun has fallen down. The kids soon rally together to break curfew so they can see an 1950s drive-in horror movie which they saw advertised on television, called The Bloodening. While at the movie, the screening is suddenly stopped by Wiggum. As punishment for breaking curfew, the children must clean a police billboard with Wiggum on it. To get even with their parents and the other grownups, the mortified children set up a late night radio show called \\"We Know All Your Secrets\\", in which they expose the grownups's secrets all through Springfield, just like the villainous children in the movie. They are tracked down at the billboard by Professor Frink, resulting in a massive confrontation, in song form, between the kids and adults of Springfield. However, this in turn rouses the ire of Grampa and the other senior citizens trying to get some sleep. To get even with both groups, they take the measure of voting a brand new curfew, sending everyone under the age of seventy to their own homes during sunset. It is passed by a single vote, due to Homer refusing to cast a ballot, humiliating Marge in the process. Production Mike Scully wanted to do an episode where the children of Springfield would be subject to a curfew. He came up with the idea to do a Kids vs. Adults episode, where the children would be blamed for something the adults have done. The name of the baseball announcer, Denis Conroy, was used because that is the name of writer Larry Doyle's uncle. Dan Castellaneta ad libbed Homer singing \\"Hitler is a jerk, Mussolini....\\" It was added in to the episode only for the purpose of filling time. The Chief Wiggum billboard sketch was inspired by Beaver Cleaver getting stuck in a soup bowl billboard during the \\"In the Soup\\" episode of Leave It to Beaver. The music playing when the kids secretly leave their houses to see the movie was written by composer Alf Clausen. The episode's title is a reference to the movie Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken. The movie The Bloodening is a parody of the 1960 film Village of the Damned. The sequence showing the children taking the equipment to build their radio transmitter is a recreation of a sequence from the short comedy films Our Gang, featuring similar music and a dog, with Milhouse dressed like Our Gang character Alfalfa. The review Marge reads of Talk to the Hand - \\"The writing snaps, crackles and pops\\" - was how Variety reviewed the sitcom Just Shoot Me! when it first aired in 1997. The set of \\"Don't Go There\\" is similar to Central Perk on Friends. The musical argument between kids, adults and seniors is a parody of the song \\"Kids\\" from the musical Bye Bye Birdie. When Lisa is flipping through the radio channels, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Infamy Speech can be heard. In the Springfield Elementary School shower-room Homer, Barney, Lenny, and Carl sing a medley of Queen songs consisting of \\"We Are the Champions\\" and \\"We Will Rock You\\". When Cyndi Lauper sings \\"The Star- Spangled Banner\\" it is to the tune of her hit song \\"Girls Just Want to Have Fun\\". Reception \\"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\\" finished tied for 40th in the weekly ratings for the week of January 11–17, 1999 with a Nielsen rating of 8.9. The episode has met with mostly positive reviews. In his review of The Simpsons' tenth season, James Plath of Dvdtown.com noted \\"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\\" as \\"pretty decent\\". Peter Brown of If regards \\"Lard of the Dance\\", \\"Marge Simpson in: \\"Screaming Yellow Honkers\\"\\", \\"Wild Barts Can't Be Broken\\", and \\"Homer Simpson in: \\"Kidney Trouble\\"\\" as \\"some of the best episodes of the season\\". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that the episode was \\"a curious unmemorable episode with a good chunk in the middle. Neither the opening with The Isotopes nor the finale with the rather dire song help this one at all, and frankly, if it wasn't for the superb parody of Village of the Damned, and the kids' revenge by revealing their family's secrets, it'd sink without trace.\\" In 2007, Simon Crerar of The Times listed Lauper's performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show.

History The area of present-day Higashi-Matsushima was part of ancient Mutsu Province, and has been settled since at least the Jōmon period by the Emishi people. During the Nara period, the area came under the control of colonists from the Yamato dynasty based at nearby Tagajō. During the Sengoku period, the area was contested by various samurai clans before the area came under the control of the Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period. Following the Meiji restoration, the area was organized into Monō District, Miyagi Prefecture. The town of Yamoto was created on April 1, 1940 and the town of Naruse on May 3, 1955. The city of Higashi-Matsushima was created on April 1, 2005, when the towns of Naruse and Yamoto were merged. 2011 Earthquake disaster Houses inundated and collapsed by the tsunami in Nobiru, Higashimatsushima On March 11, 2011, Higashi-Matsushima was severely hit by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami resulting in at least 1,039 deaths,NOAA Data 2 April 2011 and the destruction of over 11,000 structures, or approximately two-thirds of the buildings in the city limits.

He was appointed a cardinal by Pope John Paul II, but died shortly before the consistory. Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger said in his funeral oration for von Balthasar that \\"he is right in what he teaches of the faith\\" and that he \\"points the way to the sources of living water.\\" With Ratzinger and Henri de Lubac, he founded the theological journal Communio. Over the course of his life, he authored eighty-five books, over five hundred articles and essays, and almost a hundred translations. He is known for his fifteen-volume trilogy on beauty (The Glory of the Lord), goodness (Theo- Drama), and truth (Theo-Logic). Biography = Early life = Franziskanerkirche (Franciscan Church) in Lucerne, Switzerland Balthasar was born in Lucerne, Switzerland, on 12 August 1905, to a noble family. His father, Oscar Ludwig Carl von Balthasar (1872–1946), was a church architect, and his mother, Gabrielle Pietzcker (d. 1929), helped found the Schweizerischer Katholischer Frauenbund (Swiss League of Catholic Women). Pietzcker was related to the beatified Hungarian bishop Blessed Vilmos Apor, who was shot by Soviet troops in 1945 for protecting women. Oscar and Gabrielle had three children. Hans Urs was the eldest. Their son Dieter would join the Swiss Guard. Their daughter Renée (1908–1986) became the superior general of the Franciscan Sisters of Sainte-Marie des Anges.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 8. Hans Urs would later describe his family as \\"straightforwardly Catholic.\\" He adds, \\"I grew up with a faith that was equally straightforward, untroubled by doubt. I can still remember the silent and very moving early Masses on my own in the choir of the Franciscan church in Lucerne and the ten-o'clock Mass in the Jesuit church, which I thought was stunningly beautiful.\\" As a child, Hans and his family spent much time at the hotel Pension Felsberg, which his grandmother managed. Here, he was regularly exposed to a \\"cosmopolitan\\" atmosphere where \\"trilingualism (German, French, English) [was] taken for granted,\\" as biographer Peter Henrici notes.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 8–9. Hans, who had absolute pitch, was immersed in classical music, particularly Schubert, Tchaikovsky, and Mahler, and this interest would continue through early adulthood. By his own account, he \\"spent endless hours on the piano\\".Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 36. While doing university studies in Vienna, he reportedly would play the piano four hands almost nightly with his roommate Rudolf Allers. Later, as a Jesuit chaplain, he would perform a transcription of Mozart's Don Giovanni from memory.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 16. = Education = Von Balthasar in his early twenties, during studies in Vienna Educated first by Benedictine monks at the abbey school of Engelberg in central Switzerland—during the time of the First World War—von Balthasar transferred to the more academically rigorous Stella Matutina, a preparatory school run by the Society of Jesus in Feldkirch, Austria, whose alumni include Arthur Conan Doyle and the Thomist cardinal Franz Ehrle. Aside from music, von Balthasar also took a strong interest in literature, later citing Dante and Goethe as key early influences.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 9. A year before graduation from Stella Matutina, he enrolled early at the University of Zurich to study German literature. After stints researching in Vienna and Berlin, he obtained his doctorate in 1928, with a dissertation on the theme of Eschatology in German and Germanophone thought, drawing heavily from Catholic theology.The doctorate was entitled \\"History of the Eschatological Problem in German Literature\\". It appeared, considerably rewritten, as Apokalypse der deutschen Seele, 3 vols, (Salzburg, 1937-9) Writing in the 1980s, he said of this latter work that \\"its fundamental impulse was the desire to reveal ... the ultimate religious attitude, often hidden, of the great figures of modern German literature. I wanted to let them, so to speak, 'make their confession'. The work was of insufficient maturity—most of the chapters ought to be rewritten—and yet some of it may still be valid.\\"Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 37. According to Henrici, submitting a dissertation of this nature to the \\"Liberal Protestant\\" University of Zurich was academically risky for a student at that time, but the faculty awarded von Balthasar his doctorate summa cum laude.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 10–11. = Society of Jesus = Though a practicing Catholic, with \\"untroubled faith\\" and \\"devotion to our Lady,\\" von Balthasar had remained largely uninterested in theology and spirituality until his university years. At the University of Vienna—where atheism was prevalent—he was influenced in his religious thinking by Professor Hans Eibl and, more decisively, his friend Rudolf Allers, a convert to Catholicism. While studying in Berlin, too, he heard lectures by the theologian Romano Guardini.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 10. In 1929, von Balthasar attended a retreat for students in Wyhlen, Germany, and sensed what he believed to be a sudden call to follow Jesus Christ: > Even today [in 1959], after thirty years, I could still find again the tree > on the lost path in the Black Forest, not far from Basel, under which I was > struck as if by lightning.... [I]t was neither theology nor the priesthood > that, at that moment, appeared in a flash before my mind; it was this alone: > You have nothing to choose; you are called. You will not serve; another will > use you. You have no plans to make; you are only a small little tile in a > mosaic that has long been ready. I needed only to \\"leave everything and > follow,\\" without making plans, without wishes or ideas: I needed only to > stand there and wait and see what I would be used for—and so it happened.von > Balthasar, Hans Urs. \\"Perché mi sono fatto sacerdote.\\" In Hans Urs von > Balthasar. Edited by Elio Guerriero. Milan: Edizioni Paoline, 1991. He understood this experience as having been mediated by the figure of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. Von Balthasar would later write of Loyola, \\"I did not choose him; he set me ablaze like a bolt of lightning.\\"von Balthasar, Hans Urs (1988). \\"Le sorgenti della vita.\\" In La realtà e la gloria: Articoli e interviste 1978–1988. Milan: EDIT. On November 18, 1929, von Balthasar entered the Society of Jesus in south Germany, not long after the death of his mother.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 12. At that time, Jesuit work and ministry was prohibited in Switzerland by constitutional law.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 14–15. Von Balthasar (second from left) with his sister, father, and brother After two years as a Jesuit novice, he studied philosophy at Pullach, near Munich, where he came into contact with Erich Przywara, who formed him in Scholasticism and whose work on the analogia entis impacted him, though he would later express some hesitation about certain aspects of his thought. In 1932, von Balthasar moved to Fourvière, the Jesuit school in Lyon, France, for four years of theological study. Here he encountered fellow Jesuits Henri Bouillard, Jean Daniélou, Gaston Fessard, and Henri de Lubac, figures later associated with the nouvelle théologie. De Lubac kindled the young student's interest in the Church Fathers, especially Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Maximus the Confessor. In Lyon, von Balthasar also encountered the work of French writers Charles Péguy, Georges Bernanos, and Paul Claudel. Von Balthasar was ordained a priest on July 26, 1936. As a motto on his ordination card, he used the phrase \\"Benedixit, fregit, deditque\\" [\\"He blessed it, broke it, and gave\\"], taken from the words of the institution of the Eucharist in the Gospel of Luke.Henrici, \\"A Sketch\\", p. 14. After finishing his theological studies in 1937, he went sent to Munich to work at the journal Stimmen der Zeit, where he remained until 1939. He completed his tertianship with Father Albert Steger in 1940. Von Balthasar (third from right) with the Studentische Schulungsgemeinschaft When given the choice between a professorship at the Gregorian University in Rome and a role as student chaplain in Basel, Switzerland, he chose the chaplaincy, preferring pastoral work to academia. Moving to Basel in 1940, von Balthasar edited the Europaische Reihe literary series for the Sammlung Klosterberg, translated French Resistance poetry, helped to produce plays (including a staging of his own translations of Bernanos' Dialogues of the Carmelites and Claudel's The Satin Slipper), published book-length studies on Maximus the Confessor and Saint Gregory of Nyssa, and regularly lectured to students. He established the Studentische Schulungsgemeinschaft in 1941, an institute for student formation that featured courses and conferences by Hugo Rahner, Martin Buber, Yves Congar, Gustav Siewerth, Henri de Lubac, and others. To the students, von Balthasar offered liturgies, sermons, retreats, and spiritual direction, with a particular emphasis on the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 15–16. According to Jacques Servais, \\"A good number of the young men eventually entered the Society of Jesus, while others decided to remain in the lay state, hoping to find a form of consecration to God in the world.\\" = Collaboration with Adrienne von Speyr = border During his first months in Basel, he met the physician Adrienne von Speyr through a mutual friend. A mother in her late thirties, and a somewhat prominent figure in Basel society, she was married to the historian Werner Kaegi, with two children from her first marriage to Emil Dürr, who had died suddenly in 1934. She was a Protestant, but interested in becoming Catholic. Von Balthasar began to offer her catechetical instruction and later said of this process, “In the instructions she understood everything immediately, as though she had only—and for how long!—waited to hear exactly what I was saying in order to affirm it.” Shortly following her reception into the Catholic Church on November 1, 1940—at a liturgy celebrated by von Balthasar—von Speyr began reporting intense experiences in prayer, including visions of Christ's Passion and encounters with various saints. In von Balthasar's words, \\"A veritable cataract of mystical graces poured over Adrienne in a seemingly chaotic storm that whirled her in all directions at once.\\"Von Balthasar, First Glance, p. 33. He began to accompany her as a spiritual director, in order to help evaluate the experiences. After he became convinced of the authenticity of von Speyr's mysticism, von Balthasar and von Speyr both began to believe that they had a shared theological mission.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 13–20. Between 1944 and 1960, von Speyr dictated to von Balthasar some sixty books of spiritual and Scriptural commentary. Given von Speyr's responsibilities as a mother and a practicing doctor, von Balthasar alone worked to arrange, edit, and publish the texts. In 1947, he founded a publishing house, Johannes Verlag, in Einsiedeln, Switzerland, where he began to print and distribute her works with ecclesiastical imprimatur.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 19. Some of von Speyr's works, namely those of a more explicitly mystical character, were not released until Pope John Paul II organized a Vatican symposium on her thought in 1985, almost twenty years after her death.Von Balthasar, First Glance, pp. 91–95.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 9. In an interview with Angelo Scola in 1986, von Balthasar gave a portrait of his relationship with the \\"extensive theology\\" of von Speyr: > All I attempted to do was gather it up and embed it in a space, such as the > theology of the Fathers, that of the Middle Ages and the modern age, with > which I was fairly familiar. My contribution consisted in providing a > comprehensive theological horizon, so that all that was new and valid in her > thought would not be watered down or falsified, but be given space to > unfold. With a mere textbook-theology one could not have captured Adrienne's > work; it required a knowledge of the great tradition to realize that her > original propositions in no way contradicted it.Von Balthasar, Test > Everything, p. 88. Von Speyr and von Balthasar also collaborated closely in the founding of the Johannesgemeinschaft (Community of Saint John), a Catholic institute of consecrated laypeople established in 1945, with a mission to work for the sanctification of the world from within the world.Von Balthasar, Our Task, p. 55. It became more widely known three years later when Balthasar produced a theology for secular institutes in his work Der Laie und der Ordenstand, the first book to be published by Johannes Verlag.Aidan Nichols, The word has been abroad: a guide through Balthasar's aesthetics, Introduction to Hans Urs von Balthasar 1, (1998), p. xviii. After a long discernment, von Balthasar would eventually leave the Society of Jesus to found this community, since his superiors did not believe it would be compatible with Jesuit life. He saw it as a \\"personal, special, and non-delegable task.\\" Von Speyr referred to the Johannesgemeinschaft metaphorically as a “Child” she shared with the priest—an analogy that has drawn some criticism but been defended by others.Miles, Obedience, pp. 11, 50–52. Von Speyr served as the superior of the women's branch of the community until her death. = Departure from the Jesuits = Beginning in 1945, the year in which he published Das Herz der Welt (Heart of the World), von Balthasar met a series of difficulties. He was scheduled to give a Christmas sermon on Swiss public radio, but this was cancelled at the last moment because of the ongoing national constitutional ban on Jesuit activity. The event caused some controversy. In June 1946, his father passed away, followed not long after by his godmother. In May 1946, Robert Rast, a Jesuit novice who had been his friend and collaborator in the Schulungsgemeinschaft, died of tuberculosis.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 19-20. That same year, his Jesuit superiors informed him that the Society of Jesus could not be answerable for the Community of Saint John, the secular institute he had begun to organize with Adrienne von Speyr.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 21. Feeling that he \\"was being called by God to certain definite tasks in the Church,\\" he made a thirty-day retreat at the request of Father General Jean- Baptiste Janssens, where the director confirmed that von Balthasar, while remaining a priest, should leave the Jesuit order to work with the Community of Saint John. Von Balthasar considered this a \\"very grave\\" step,Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 20–21. but in 1950, he officially departed from the Society of Jesus. He renewed his religious vows a few months later. Shortly before his exit from the Society, the University of Munich offered him a professorship, as a successor to Romano Guardini, but he declined.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 24. He remained without a ministerial role in the Church until, in 1956, he was incardinated into the Diocese of Chur as a diocesan priest. = Lectures, writing, and publishing (1950–1967) = The Glory of the Lord, vol. 1 (2nd English ed., Ignatius Press, 2009) Von Balthasar's exit from the Jesuits left him \\"literally on the street\\", as biographer Peter Henrici notes, and he took up lecture tours across Germany, which helped him provide for himself and fund the Johannes Verlag publishing house.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 23–24. He also continued giving retreats to young people. Between 1950 and 1956, he authored a number of books and articles, including Therese von Lisieux (Thérèse of Lisieux) (1950), Schleifung der Bastionen (Razing the Bastions) (1952), Das betrachtende Gebet (Prayer) (1955), and Die Gottesfrage des heutigen Menschen (The God Question and Modern Man) (1956), as well as monograph studies of Georges Bernanos, Karl Barth, and Reinhold Schneider. Much of his work during this period—written after the release of Pope Pius XII's apostolic constitution Provida Mater Ecclesia, which gave an ecclesiastical blessing to secular institutes—confronts the question of how Christian discipleship might be lived from within the world.Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 26–27. After he was welcomed into the Diocese of Chur, he settled in the city of Basel, hosted by his married friends Werner Kaegi and Adrienne von Speyr, in whose home he remained until 1967. During this period—although he was diagnosed with leukemia in 1958—von Balthasar wrote prolifically,Peter Henrici (1991), pp. 26. most notably the seven-volume work Herrlichkeit (The Glory of the Lord) (1961–1967), which was to serve as the first part of a theological trilogy on the three classical transcendentals of beauty, goodness, and truth. He also translated and edited for Johannes Verlag, with an emphasis on the writing of his collaborator von Speyr. Balthasar was not invited to take part in the Second Vatican Council, which took place during this time, but after the release of Herrlichkeit, his theological reputation would grow significantly. Adrienne von Speyr, who had been seriously ill since the mid-1950s, died on September 17, 1967, and Balthasar assumed responsibility for the Community of Saint John. = Later years: Communio and ecclesiastical honors = Moving to another house in Basel, Von Balthasar continued to write, edit, and translate extensively. In 1969, Pope Paul VI appointed him to the International Theological Commission. He worked as a theological secretary at the Second Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 1971, penning the synod document on priestly spirituality, and he also received the Romano Guardini Prize from the Catholic Academy of Bavaria.Peter Henrici (1991), p. 35. Pope John Paul II with Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger With Joseph Ratzinger and Henri de Lubac, he founded the international theological journal Communio in 1971, with collaboration from members of the Italian Communion and Liberation movement, including Angelo Scola. The journal was conceived as a more traditionally minded alternative to the progressive Concilium, and von Balthasar described its mission in terms of courage: \\"[T]his truth we believe in strips us bare. Like lambs among wolves. It is not a matter of bravado, but of Christian courage, to expose oneself to risk.\\" Karol Wojtyła became the editor of the Polish edition of the review. Later in the 1970s, he was given fellowships at the British Academy and the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, in addition to prizes for translation. In 1984 Pope John Paul II awarded him the first Paul VI International Prize for his contributions to theology. The following year saw an official Vatican symposium on the life and work of Adrienne von Speyr, which closed with a laudatory closing address by the pope. = Death = center From the low point of being banned from teaching as a result of his leaving the Society of Jesus,Leaving the Society meant that Balthasar was without a position, a pastorate, a place to live, or an income. Because he had left the Jesuit order, the Catholic Congregation for Seminaries and Universities had banned him from teaching. But he eventually found an ecclesiastical home under a sympathetic bishop and was able to live by a grueling schedule of lecture tours. \\"Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905-1988)\\" Radical Faith The Society of the Sacred Mission , retrieved 1 February 2009. von Balthasar's reputation had risen to the extent that Pope John Paul II named him to be a cardinal in 1988. He died, however, in his home in Basel on 26 June 1988, two days before the ceremony which would have formally granted him that position.On 29 May 1988 Pope John Paul II announced his intention to nominate von Balthasar as cardinal at the next consistory, held 28 June 1988; see Salvador Miranda, \\"Consistories for the creation of Cardinals: 20th Century (1903-2005),\\" retrieved 9 May 2013. One is not a cardinal until the Pope formally announces the new cardinal in a consistory with the existing members of the college of cardinals; see Code of Canon Law (1983), canon 351. He is buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Leodegar im Hof (Hofkirche) in Lucerne. Theology Along with Karl Rahner and Bernard Lonergan, Balthasar sought to offer a response to Western modernity, which posed a challenge to traditional Catholic thought. While Rahner offered a progressive, accommodating position on modernity and Lonergan worked out a philosophy of history that sought to critically appropriate modernity, Balthasar resisted the reductionism and human focus of modernity, wanting Christianity to be more challenging toward modern sensibilities.; Balthasar is very eclectic in his approach, sources, and interests and remains difficult to categorize. An example of his eclecticism was his long study and conversation with the influential Reformed Swiss theologian, Karl Barth, on whose work he wrote the first Catholic analysis and response. Although Balthasar's major points of analysis on Karl Barth's work have been disputed, his The Theology of Karl Barth: Exposition and Interpretation (1951) remains a classic work for its sensitivity and insight; Karl Barth himself agreed with its analysis of his own theological enterprise, calling it the best book on his own theology. A distinctive thought in Balthasar's work is that our first experience after birth is the face of love of our mothers, where the I encounters for the first time the Thou, and the Thou smiles in a relationship of love and sustenance. Writings and thought = Trilogy = Balthasar was better known for his sixteen-volume systematic theological \\"trilogy\\", published between 1961 and 1987, with a concluding Epilog (Epilogue). It is called a trilogy because it is divided into three parts: Herrlichkeit (The Glory of the Lord), Theodramatik (Theo-Drama), and Theologik (Theo-Logic). They follow the threefold self-description of Jesus in John (\\"I am the way, the truth, and the life\\") and therefore the transcendentals bonum, verum, and pulchrum (the good, the true, and the beautiful), although the trilogy begins with Herrlichkeit, a study of the pulchrum, the beautiful. Herrlichkeit (The Glory of the Lord)  Herrlichkeit is a seven-volume work on theological aesthetics. One of the most often quoted passages from the trilogy comes from the first volume, Schau der Gestalt (Seeing the Form): \\"Before the beautiful—no, not really before but within the beautiful—the whole person quivers. He not only 'finds' the beautiful moving; rather, he experiences himself as being moved and possessed by it.\\" #Schau der Gestalt (Seeing the Form) (1961) #Fächer der Stile: Klerikale Stile (Studies in Theological Style: Clerical Styles) (1962) #Fächer der Stile: Laikale Stile (Studies in Theological Style: Lay Styles) (1962) #Im Raum der Metaphysik: Altertum (The Realm of Metaphysics in Antiquity) (1965) #Im Raum der Metaphysik: Neuzeit (The Realm of Metaphysics in the Modern Age) (1965) #Theologie: Alter Bund (Theology: The Old Covenant) (1967) #Theologie: Neuer Bund (Theology: The New Covenant) (1967) Theodramatik (Theo-Drama)  Theodramatik is a five-volume work of \\"theological dramatic theory\\", examining the ethics and goodness in the action of God and in man's response, especially in the events of Good Friday, Holy Saturday, and Easter Sunday. Balthasar's soteriology, christology, and eschatology are here developed. #Prolegomena (Prolegomena) (1973) #Die Personen des Spiels: Der Mensch in Gott (Dramatis Personae: Man in God) (1976) #Die Personen des Spiels: Die Personen in Christus (Dramatis Personae: Persons in Christ) (1978) #Die Handlung (The Action) (1981) #Das Endspiel (The Last Act) (1983) Theologik (Theo-Logic)  Theologik is a three-volume work on \\"theological logical theory\\" describing the truth about the relation of the nature of Jesus Christ (christology) to reality itself (ontology, or the study of being). Volume 1, Wahrheit der Welt (Truth of the World), originally appeared as a standalone book in 1947, but was released with some revision in 1985 as the first part of Theologik. #Wahrheit der Welt (Truth of the World) (1985) #Wahrheit Gottes (Truth of God) (1985) #Der Geist der Wahrheit (The Spirit of Truth) (1987) = Apokalypse der deutschen Seele = Balthasar's first major work, the three- volume Apokalypse der deutschen Seele (1937–39) (Apocalypse of the German Soul), was an expansion of his doctoral dissertation and a study in German literature, theology, and philosophy. Published in Germany and Austria during the Third Reich, one scholar has argued that the work contains anti- Semitism.See \\"Chapter Seven: The anti-modern anti-Semitic complex\\" in Paul Silas Peterson, The Early Hans Urs von Balthasar: Historical Contexts and Intellectual Formation (2015). Von Balthasar later remarked on the Apokalypse, \\"The work was of insufficient maturity—most of the chapters ought to be rewritten—and yet some of it may still be valid.\\" = Other works = Balthasar also wrote of the lives of saints and Church fathers. Saints appear as an example of the lived Christian life throughout his writings. Instead of merely systematic analysis of theology, Balthasar described his theology as a \\"kneeling theology\\" deeply connected to contemplative prayer and as a \\"sitting theology\\" intensely connected to faith seeking understanding guided by the heart and mind of the Catholic Church. Balthasar was very concerned that his writings address spiritual and practical issues. He insisted that his theology never be divorced from the mystical experiences of his long-time friend and convert, the physician Adrienne von Speyr. Balthasar published varied works spanning many decades, fields of study (e.g., literature and literary analysis, lives of the saints, and the Church Fathers), and languages. Balthasar used the expression Casta Meretrix to argue that the term Whore of Babylon was acceptable in a certain tradition of the Church, in the writings of Rabanus Maurus for instance.Casta Meretrix: The Church as Harlot . At Balthasar's funeral, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, later to become Pope Benedict XVI, said, speaking of Balthasar's work in general: \\"What the pope intended to express by this mark of distinction [i.e., elevation to the cardinalate], and of honor, remains valid; no longer only private individuals but the Church itself, in its official responsibility, tells us that he is right in what he teaches of the faith.\\" =Debate on Hell, hope, and salvation= Saint Teresia Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein) In light of the 1987 book Was dürfen wir hoffen? [English title: Dare We Hope \\"That All Men Be Saved\\"?], a number of critics have accused von Balthasar of implicitly advocating universalism or apocatastasis, the teaching that all people will inherit eternal life, often associated with Origen.Oakes; Moss, eds. (2004). p. 261. Quotation: \\"Balthasar does not deny the possibility of salvation outside the boundaries of explicit Christianity - in fact he is probably more emphatic than Rahner in maintaining the legitimacy of Christian hope for universal salvation.\\" Many, however, reject this criticism as a misreading of the theologian's work.\\"It is curious indeed that a text so often characterized as advocating an easy 'universalism' in regard to salvation actually commences with a clear statement that all men stand under the divine judgment. Whatever else Hans Urs von Balthasar says in this book, the one thing he is quite clearly not saying is that we have certain knowledge that all people will be saved.\\" Barron, Robert (2014). Foreword to Dare We Hope \\"That All Men Be Saved\\"?. San Francisco: Ignatius Press. Von Balthasar himself denounces the doctrine of definite universal salvation and affirms the concrete possibility of being damned, while insisting on the Christian duty to hope charitably that each person will be saved: \\"Thomas Aquinas taught that 'one can hope for eternal life for the other as long as one is united with him through love,' and from which of our brothers would it be permissible to withhold this love?\\"Hans Urs von Balthasar (1988), p. 171. Quoting Summa Theologiae II-II, q. 17, a. 3. Ralph Martin and James O'Connor hold that von Balthasar's denial of universalism is incomplete, given his prominent use of a quote by Carmelite saint Edith Stein in his book-length essay Kleiner Diskurs über die Hölle (A Short Discourse on Hell, included in the English translation of Dare We Hope), which references an \\"infinitely improbable\\" resistance to grace. Stein writes: > All-merciful love can thus descend to everyone. We believe that it does so. > And now, can we assume that there are souls that remain perpetually closed > to such love? As a possibility in principle, this cannot be rejected. In > reality, it can become infinitely improbable—precisely through what > preparatory grace is capable of effecting in the soul. It can do no more > than knock at the door, and there are souls that already open themselves to > it upon hearing this unobtrusive call. Others allow it to go unheeded. Then > it can steal its way into souls and begin to spread itself out there more > and more.... If all the impulses opposed to the spirit have been expelled > from the soul, then any free decision against this has become infinitely > improbable.Stein, Edith (1962). Welt und Person. Freiburg. Quoted in Hans > Urs von Balthasar (1988), p. 175–76. Defending von Balthasar, Avery Cardinal Dulles interprets this passage as an \\"orthodox\\" expression of \\"hope\\" rather than a systematic soteriological doctrine. Other scholars have similarly recognized this distinction in the theologian's work more generally.Morwenna Ludlow (2000). Universal salvation: eschatology in the thought of Gregory of Nyssa p. 5. \\"Von Balthasar hopes for universal salvation and warns against asserting it outright (e.g. Mysterium Paschale, 177–8, 262–6; Dare We Hope . . ., 148–57, 236–54) Von Balthasar responded to allegations of heresy after the publication of Was dürfen wir hoffen? by asking, \\"How can anyone equate hoping with knowing? I hope that my friend will recover from his serious illness—do I therefore know this?\\"Hans Urs von Balthasar (1988), p. 131. The position has been described as the result of a sort of conflict among the theological virtues, since \\"Love believes all things, [but also] hopes all things\\" (1 Corinthians ), what for fides must be rejected, for spes must be accepted, in order to recover with the theology of hope what in 553 the dogmatic theology had condemned with the anathema of the fifth Ecumenical Council of Constantinople against the possibility of apocatastasis or universal salvation.Hans Urs von Balthasar (1988) Epilogue. Apokatastasis: Universal reconciliation (pp. 137ff.). As Alyssa Pitstick phrases it, universal salvation, if it happens, would be the result of the \\"utter abandonment the Son undergoes\\". In A Short Discourse on Hell, von Balthasar lists Erich Przywara, Henri de Lubac, Gaston Fessard, Maurice Blondel, Charles Péguy, Paul Claudel, Gabriel Marcel, Leon Bloy, Joseph Ratzinger, Walter Kasper, Romano Guardini, and Karl Rahner as Catholic thinkers who share his perspective on hope—\\"In summa: a company in which one can feel quite comfortable\\".Balthasar, Dare We Hope, p. 133. Theologians have also expressed concerns about von Balthasar's depictions of Holy Saturday and Christ's descent into Hell, particularly as outlined in the last volume of the book Theo-Drama. Others support von Balthasar's account, including Joseph Ratzinger, who called Theo-Drama a \\"profound analysis of the essence of Christian hope\\" and a \\"foundational contribution\\" to the theological field of Eschatology. This theme is also explored in von Balthasar's 1969 book Theologie der drei Tage (Mysterium Paschale). Reception Pope Benedict XVI has described von Balthasar and Henri de Lubac as the two theologians he appreciates the most. In a 2016 interview, he claimed he shared an \\"inward intention\\" and \\"vision\\" with Balthasar, remarking positively, \\"It is unbelievable what this person has written and done.\\" Balthasar's dramatic theory in Theo-Drama influenced the work of Raymund Schwager.The influence is reflected in some of Schwager's titles, i.e.: Jesus in the Drama of Salvation. Toward a Biblical Doctrine of Redemption (German: Jesus im Heilsdrama. Entwurf einer biblischen Erlösungslehre), New York: Crossroad 1999, and: Banished from Eden: Original Sin and Evolutionary Theory in the Drama of Salvation (Duits: Erbsünde und Heilsdrama: Im Kontext von Evolution, Gentechnik und Apokalyptik), Londen: Gracewing 2006. Balthasar's major writings have been translated into English, and the journal he co-founded with Henri de Lubac, Karl Lehmann, and Joseph Ratzinger, Communio, currently appears in twelve languages. In delivering his eulogy, Ratzinger, quoting de Lubac, called Balthasar, \\"perhaps the most cultured man of our time.\\" In March 2018, together with Adrienne von Speyr, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Chur formally opened their cause towards canonisation. Von Balthasar has also been highly influential in the work of Bishop Robert Barron, who has been an ardent advocate of von Balthasar's soteriology.

Medvei, The History of Clinical Endocrinology, p. 45. or Mesue, Masuya, Mesue Major, Msuya, and Mesuë the Elder was a Persian or Assyrian Nestorian Christian physician from the Academy of Gundishapur. According to The Canon of Medicine for Avicenna and 'Uyun al-Anba for the medieval Arabic historian Ibn Abi Usaybi'a, Masawaiyh's father was Assyrian and his mother was Slavic. Life Mesue Born in 777 CE as the son of a pharmacist and physician from Gundishapur, he came to Baghdad and studied under Jabril ibn Bukhtishu. He became director of a hospital in Baghdad, and was personal physician to four caliphs. He composed medical treatises on a number of topics, including ophthalmology, fevers, leprosy, headache, melancholia, dietetics, the testing of physicians, and medical aphorisms. One of Masawaiyh's treatises concerns aromatics, entitled, On Simple Aromatic Substances. It was reported that Ibn Masawayh regularly held an assembly of some sort, where he consulted with patients and discussed subjects with pupils. Ibn Masawayh apparently attracted considerable audiences, having acquired a reputation for repartee. He was also the teacher of Hunain ibn Ishaq. He translated various Greek medical works into Syriac, but wrote his own work in Arabic. Apes were supplied to him by the caliph al-Mu'tasim for dissection. Many anatomical and medical writings are credited to him, notably the \\"Disorder of the Eye\\" (Daghal al-'ain), which is the earliest Systematic treatise on ophthalmology extant in Arabic and the Aphorisms, the Latin translation of which was very popular in the Middle Ages.

He introduced the assembly line to the German automobile industry. His father, Adam Opel, had founded the family firm as a manufacturer of sewing machines, and later diversified into bicycle manufacturing. Wilhelm studied engineering at Technische Hochschule Darmstadt and received his doctorate in 1912 from the university. After Adam's death in 1895, control of the company passed to his wife and five sons. In 1898, Wilhelm and his brother Fritz brought Opel into the automobile industry with the purchase of the small Lutzmann automobile factory at Dessau. In 1917, Wilhelm and his brother Heinrich Opel were raised to the nobility of the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Their brother Carl was raised to the same rank the following year. Wilhelm had one son and one daughter, Fritz von Opel and Eleonore von Opel. 1933, Opel joined the Nazi Party and soon became an active supporter of it, making financial contributions to the SS and being awarded the title of Patron.

Biography  Opel-Mausoleum in Rüsselsheim. Adam Opel was born on 9 May 1837 to Wilhelm, a locksmith, and his wife in Rüsselsheim. Adam studied with his father until the age of 20, when he received his travel pass. The pass enabled him to be an apprentice locksmith in Belgium, in Liege, Brussels, and then Paris, where he arrived in mid-1858. While in Paris, he took an interest in an innovation—the sewing machine. In 1859, he went to work for a maker of sewing machines to get a closer look. Adam's younger brother, George, also came to Paris to absorb this new technology. In 1862, Adam returned to Rüsselsheim. Adam's uncle offered him an unused cow stall in Rüsselsheim to set up a workshop in which to build his own sewing machine. In 1863, George returned from France to help in the slow production of the machines. In April 1867, Adam was preparing to build a new two-story factory near the railroad station, when his father died. Adam attached a new home to his factory and married the daughter of a guest-house and brewery family, Sophie Scheller. Sophie brought with her a substantial dowry, which she invested in the Opel plant. Sophie convinced two of her sisters to invest as well, and a steam engine was purchased, helping to expand the firm. In 1870 a new sewing machine called “Sophia” was introduced, named after Opel's wife. In the 1880s, sewing machine production jumped ahead, with steady expansion of the plant, and by 1899 more than a half million machines had been made. The milestone of one million machines was reached in 1911, the same time a fire destroyed much of the plant. The Opel brothers decided to give up sewing machine production, which by this time was much more commodified, and thus commercially unrewarding, than when they had started in the business. Looking to move upmarket in their manufacturing efforts, they decided to try to produce the more profitable products of bicycles and automobiles. Adam and Sophia had five sons (Carl, Wilhelm, Heinrich, Friedrich, and Ludwig), who took wholeheartedly to wheels. Together with Sophie, who became main shareholder after the death of her husband, they would pilot the Opel enterprises down the automotive path. Bicycles came into the picture when Adam's curiosity was stirred by a high-wheeled bicycle he saw in Paris. Intrigued, he ordered a set of parts from England. After putting together the bike Adam tried it with disastrous results. He decided he'd have nothing further to do with those \\"bone breakers.\\" Two things changed his mind: he found them easy to sell, with a greater profit than he could earn with the sewing machines; and his sons begged him mercilessly for bicycles of their own. By 1886 the Opels had made a bicycle of their own, and the following year young Carl went to England to study the new industry and bring back samples of the latest designs. This led to serious production of cycles, including low- wheeled and three-wheeled types, by the end of 1887. The growing bands of enthusiasts for this new locomotion knew they could count on Opel for the newest and best ideas in cycling in Germany. Every one of the Opel brothers was an outstanding, prize-winning racer. Adam Opel never lived to see the automobiles built by the company he founded. He died in 1895. His will set up a new organization for the company, in which his widow Sophie held the primary interest and his two eldest sons had lesser shares. Their first crisis was a sudden deflation of the boom in bicycles in 1898, a collapse caused by the over-expansion among the many makers of cycles. They managed to carry on. New products were introduced that kept on the more than 1,500 employees, most of whom had grown up in the industry with Opel. The bicycle plant expanded, eventually becoming the largest in the mid-1920s, with a capacity of 4,000 cycles a day, with innovative equipment such as automatic painting and plating equipment in halls pressurized for ideal cleanliness. By the 1930s, times had changed. In a series of transactions between 1929 and 1931, the Opel family sold their business, Adam Opel AG, to General Motors Corporation, of which it became a subsidiary. In 1936, Opel sold its bicycle plant to NSU in Neckarsulm (which had started making bicycles at about the same time as Opel). Under the company's many different names, 2.5 million bikes had been produced in all.

When the film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides to learn more about Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor. Thomas Edison inspires Homer to begin inventing The family disapproves of his first few inventions, including a make-up shotgun, electric hammer, alarm that only stops beeping when something is wrong, and reclining chair with a built-in toilet, making Homer more depressed. However, they like one particular invention, a chair with two hinged legs on the back, making it impossible to tip over backwards. Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning he never told anyone of this invention. Homer and Bart travel to the Thomas Edison National Historical Park in West Orange, New Jersey, with his electric hammer to destroy the chair, but Homer notices a poster of Edison comparing himself to Leonardo da Vinci, much like how Homer compared himself to Edison. Feeling a renewed connection to Edison, he decides not to destroy the chair. Homer and Bart return to Springfield, unaware they left Homer's electric hammer at the museum. Later when the family watches the news on television, Kent Brockman announces that the chair and electric hammer have been discovered at the Edison Museum and are expected to generate millions for Edison's already wealthy heirs, to the ire of the family. Production \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" was written by John Swartzwelder, who had a deal with the producers of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although he was the one who wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. \\"Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy,\\" Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said \\"it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it.\\" Mark Kirkland was the director of \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\". He recalls that when he attended the table-read for the episode, the staff thought it was \\"hilarious\\" and they could tell it was \\"going to be a good one.\\" It was the last episode to be produced during the season nine production run and because it takes several months to complete the production of a single episode, it had to air as a hold-over in the upcoming tenth season. It was decided that \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" would be the premiere episode of season ten. As a result, the annual premiere party was held at the Museum of Science and Technology in Los Angeles – it was a tradition for the premiere party to be related to the premiere episode. Kirkland cites his assistant director Matthew Nastuk as a big influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because he had grown up in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To help make the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them. William Daniels guest starred as KITT, a character from Knight Rider, in the episodeThe episode features a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, after failing to cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: \\"Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ...\\"; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. Daniels' appearance in \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" was the first and only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that \\"when I told my son in New York that I was going to be on The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes.\\" Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" finished 25th in the ratings for the week of September 14–20, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 8.0, equivalent to approximately 7.95 million viewing households. It tied with Beverly Hills, 90210 and Home Improvement for the 25th place. The episode was the third highest-rated show (tied with Beverly Hills, 90210) on the Fox network that week, following Ally McBeal and Party of Five. \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" has received generally positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mail cited as a \\"superb\\" and \\"hilarious\\" episode, and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a terrific episode, full of wit and sly digs at our expectations of Homer's abilities. The fact that he invents things that other people find useful (and steal the credit for) is both amusing and a little sad. Poor Homer.\\" Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson commented that \\"though 'Wizard' borders on 'Homer’s wacky scheme' territory, his attempts to come up with something significant offer amusement. At no point does 'Wizard' threaten to become a particularly strong episode, but it entertains to a reasonable degree. I do like the 'Everything’s Okay Alarm' and the makeup gun, though.\\" Although \\"Lard of the Dance\\" aired as a teaser episode a month earlier, \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\" was the official season premiere of The Simpsons tenth season. Don Aucoin of The Boston Globe wrote that \\"It is gratifying to report that, based on the season premiere, The Simpsons promises to remain the most reliable half-hour of laughs on television.\\" Similarly, David Bianculli of The New York Daily News reported that \\"The Simpsons is one series that, year after year, remains fresh and funny and lively and surprising. Based on tonight's season premiere, that amazing streak is in no danger of ending.\\" Lauri Githens of The Buffalo News gave the episode a 5/5 rating, commenting that it shows that \\"This cynical, bleak yet somehow still hopeful comedy is nowhere near midlife crisis with Season No. 10. It's still fall-down funny. Thank God.\\" She cited Homer's line to Marge as he and Bart leave for the Edison Museum, \\"I'm-taking-Bart-over-state-lines-back-soon-I- have-your-wallet-bye!\\", as the best line of the episode. The Lexington Herald- Leaders Heather Svokos was not as pleased. She stated that \\"As always, the show is better written than most anything on TV, but for a 10th season premiere, it didn't blow me out of the water.\\" In addition, Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal gave the episode a C grade, calling it an \\"off episode\\". He commented that it \\"doesn't have the zing that most Simpsons episodes do.\\" Kloer did, however, enjoy Homer's inventions such as the hamburger earmuffs and the make-up gun, and Homer's line to Marge before he shoots her with it: \\"Try to keep your nostrils closed.\\" Marge's response after being shot, \\"Homer! You’ve got it set on whore!\\", was commended by The Gazette, DVD Verdict, and Ian Jane of DVD Talk, who called the scene the highlight of the episode. In his 2015 book The Simpsons and their Mathematical Secrets, British particle physicist Dr Simon Singh wrote that in the episode, Homer writes an equation on a chalkboard and “If you work it out, you get the mass of a Higgs boson that’s only a bit larger than the nano-mass of a Higgs boson actually is. It’s kind of amazing as Homer makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered.” He stated that the mathematical backgrounds of many of the show's writers made it the \\"most mathematical TV show on prime-time television in history\\", and it could \\"encourage and nourish\\" young people with an interest in mathematics.

She is thought by some, such as the Egyptologist Elizabeth Thomas, to be that of the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Hatshepsut. This identification has been advocated by Egyptologist Zahi Hawass. Layout Isometric, plan and elevation images of KV60 taken from a 3d model This small, uninscribed tomb is located approximately front of the entrance of the tomb of Mentuherkhepshef (KV19). It consists of a rough, steep, flight of stairs leading to a doorway blocked with large stones. A pair of niches are cut into the wall just inside the entrance. A straight passage that is about long descends to a low, roughly cut chamber which measures about high. A small side chamber branches off about halfway down the descending corridor. Discovery and investigation This tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1903 during excavations conducted by the Antiquities Service on behalf of Theodore M. Davis. The burial was found to have been ransacked in antiquity but still held two female mummies, one lying in the base of a coffin, and some mummified geese. Carter reclosed the tomb, only removing the geese. In 1906, Edward R. Ayrton reopened it while clearing KV19; he removed one mummy (KV60B) together with the coffin base to the Egyptian Museum. Since neither Carter nor Ayrton drew plans or maps indicating the location of the tomb, the whereabouts of the tomb became forgotten. In 1989, the tomb was rediscovered, reopened and properly excavated by a team led by Donald P. Ryan and Mark Papworth. They found the tomb corridor littered with assorted debris; in niches on either side of the door were piled various broken pieces of funerary equipment, including the face of a coffin, its golden surface and inlaid eyes having been adzed off in antiquity. A wedjat eye was painted in each niche. An unwrapped piece of mummified meat sat on the doorstep of the small side chamber. This chamber, which was not noted by Carter, contained the discarded wrappings of the leg, which may have looked like a small human mummy when wrapped, and the moved limestone blocking that originally sealed the room's entrance. The burial chamber was found to be relatively clean, but was scattered with fragments of a burial. A pile of mummified food offerings sat opposite the entrance, and in the centre of the floor, still lay the lone female mummy (KV60A). Following mapping and excavation, she was placed in a new wooden coffin, and left in the tomb, which was resealed with a new metal door. Mummies =KV60A= The KV60A mummy, thought to be that of Hatshepsut This mummy is reasonably preserved, with a height of , and aged 50–60 years old at the time of her death. She was obese in life, and suffered from poor health; many of her teeth are missing or badly decayed, and a single root from a molar is retained in the jaw. This tooth appears to have been abscessed and extracted just before death. Her poor oral health combined with her weight may indicate she had diabetes. Her brain was not removed. Her heart is preserved in her chest and her torso is filled with embalming packs. She was eviscerated through the pelvic floor instead of through an embalming incision, perhaps due to her weight. Her left arm is crossed over her chest while the right arm is at her side. The fingernails of her left hand are tinted red and outlined in black. She may have had cancer: a tumor destroyed part of her left hip, and spread to her lumbar vertebrae. Her cause of death is assumed to be due to the metastatic cancer, complications of diabetes, or an abscessed molar that was extracted shortly before her death. Elizabeth Thomas was the first to propose that this mummy was that of Hatshepsut, relocated to the tomb of her nurse by Thutmose III, as part of his campaign of official hostility towards her. Ryan and Papworth's 1989 excavation produced evidence both in favour of, and casting doubt on the suggestion. On the supporting side, the mummy proved to be that of a relatively elderly lady, with her left arm flexed in the pose thought to mark royal women of the 18th Dynasty. On the other hand, few inscribed or dateable materials were recovered, meaning that a date range could not be firmly established. The wooden coffin face had a notch, presumably to take a false beard despite the fact that the tomb contained only women, and Hatshepsut is known to have used a false beard. Ryan felt, at that time, that advocating for KV60A as the mummy of Hatshepsut would be \\"foolishly premature\\", instead suggesting she could be any of a number of royal women or nurses from the period. The identification of this mummy as Hatshepsut hinges on the contents of a wooden box inscribed with her cartouches discovered inside the cache DB320. When it was CT-scanned in 2007, it was found to contain a mummified liver and intestine, as well as a molar tooth that lacks one root. The tooth was found to match the size, shape, and density of the remaining molars, as well as lacking the same root that is still present in the jaw. However, doubt has been cast on the validity of this attribution; the tooth may have been misidentified, and the match has yet to be confirmed by DNA testing.Bickerstaffe, D., The Burial of Hatshepsut. The Heritage of Egypt, Issue 1 - January 2008, pp. 2-9.Marchant, J., (2013), The Shadow King: The Bizarre Afterlife of King Tut's Mummy, Da Capo Press, 2013, Chapter 13. A large resin-covered coffin fragment recovered from the burial chamber was found, when cleaned, to name a hitherto unknown temple singer called Ty. Ryan suggests in his retrospective that, given the concerns over the accuracy of the identification of KV60A as Hatshepsut, it may have been readily accepted that the tomb belonged to a royal nurse and a singer if Elizabeth Thomas had not suggested Hatshepsut as one of the occupants. =KV60B= This well-preserved mummy is about tall. She has long red hair remaining on her head. Her right arm at her side, and the left arm is placed across her torso; the left hand is closed. She was eviscerated through a V-shaped embalming incision. Traces of fine linen bandages remain, with the fingers individually wrapped. Robbers looking for valuables have torn away much of the bandaging, which is bundled at the bottom of the coffin. She was once thought by Hawass to be the mummy of Hatshepsut. The coffin base she was found lying in was inscribed with the name and title wr šdt nfrw nswt In, meaning the Great Royal Nurse, In. This personage has been widely identified with Sitre In, the royal nurse of Hatshepsut, who is known from her sandstone statue from Deir el Bahari.  References  Notes Further reading * Siliotti, A.

It serves passengers between state capital Melbourne and the regional city of Geelong. According to V/Line it carries more passengers than any other regional rail line in Australia.http://www.vline.com.au/community/home/howbusy.html History V/Line commuter services to Geelong once terminated at Geelong station, being extended to the existing South Geelong station in 1968, and to the newly rebuilt Marshall station in 2005. In February 1959 the line from North Geelong to Corio was duplicated.Corio Station Rail GeelongLara, Corio, North Shore Victorian Station Histories The line from Werribee to Little River was duplicated in October 1970. In June 1981, the line to Lara was duplicated and the platform at Lara converted into an island platform, while the Little River station got a second platform. Construction of Waurn Ponds railway station was completed in 2014 and opened on 12 October, extending Geelong line services to Waurn Ponds. There have been calls to electrify the line, but plans were put on hold by the State Government in 2002, with Diesel locomotives and railcars utilised instead. Train services between Melbourne and Geelong received a government funded upgrade under the Regional Fast Rail project between 2004 and 2005, with new high speed VLocity railcars manufactured by Bombardier in Dandenong entering service to Geelong in early 2006. Services Lara V/Line VLocity train near Little River N-class locomotive hauling N-class carriages near Lara V/Line train crossing the Barwon River in Geelong Services on the Geelong line operate to a variety of stopping patterns during the weekday peak, to a frequency of 6 to 36 minutes depending on the station.

During the weekends, services operate to a 40-minute frequency, stopping at all stations between Waurn Ponds and Deer Park, and express from Deer Park to Sunshine, then to Footscray, then to Southern Cross. However, some services are filled by Warrnambool line services, which operates to different stopping patterns. Almost all services are run using VLocity railcars, but some Sprinters and locomotive-hauled N-class carriages are also used. 70-year-old S-class carriages were used until 2010. Prior to the opening of the Regional Rail Link, services ran every 20 minutes during weekdays and hourly later at night, with more frequent services during peak. Services operated every 40 minutes on weekends. In December 2013, after the opening of the first section between Southern Cross and South Kensington, Geelong trains no longer stopped at North Melbourne. From 21 June 2015, Geelong trains commenced running via the Deer Park–West Werribee line, no longer using the original line via Werribee and Newport. Performance Trains on the Geelong – Melbourne corridor are chronically late. V/Line has failed to meet their punctuality targets since 2006. As of March 2010, trains had officially run late for 44 consecutive months on the Geelong line. The poor performance of V/Line has been well documented in the local Geelong press.

She was commissioned in early August 1813, named in honor of Captain James Lawrence who had died June 4, 1813, in a famous battle with HMS Shannon. Lawrence quickly began operations with a voyage to Detroit, Michigan in search of the opposing British squadron. During the 10 September 1813 Battle of Lake Erie, Lawrence served as flagship for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry until she was disabled by enemy fire. Perry then transferred to her sister ship, , from which he fought the battle to a successful conclusion. Perry then recaptured the Lawrence at the end of the battle when the British surrendered. In mid-1815, following the end of hostilities, Lawrence was sunk in Misery Bay on Presque Isle, Pennsylvania in order to preserve her hull. Her submerged hulk was sold in 1825 and, except for a brief examination in 1836, remained underwater for five more decades. In September 1875, her remains were raised, cut into sections and transported by rail to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she was exhibited during The U.S. Centennial International Exhibition of 1876.

In some jurisdictions probation and parole officers are involved in presenting reports on offenders and making sentencing recommendation to courts of law. Probation and parole officers in Australia Probation and parole officers in Australia serve an active role in recommending community based supervision to Magistrates/Judges. They also make recommendations to parole boards to determine whether a prisoner should be granted parole. Probation officers are expected to not only supervise an offender while he/she performs community service, but to also develop the community service plans themselves. Parole officers in Canada Parole officers in Canada play a critical role at both the institutional and community levels. Their primary function is to assess risk and manage the intervention process with offenders throughout their sentence. They are the first line of defense when administering the Correctional Service of Canada's obligations towards public safety. Once the offender has entered the federal correctional system, parole officers assess the needs of offenders, such as their programming needs, and the security risks they pose. Subsequently, offenders are matched with selected institutional services such as rehabilitation programs. This includes identifying the factors contributing to criminal behavior, developing intervention plans to address them, and helping offenders to undertake and complete those intervention plans. At the institutional level, parole officers make recommendations concerning offender transfers, temporary absences, and other forms of conditional release, including parole release as part of reintegrating offenders into society. Parole officers work as part of a team which includes the offender, correctional officer, community parole officer, psychologist, and programs officer. In the community, parole officers ensure public safety by making scheduled or unscheduled visits with offenders, and communicating with family, police, employers as well as other persons who may be assisting the offender. Other duties include writing progress reports and working with many community agencies to help secure stable housing, employment and income. Probation officers in England and Wales Probation Orders were introduced by the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, and the practice of placing offenders on probation was already routinely undertaken in the London Police Courts by voluntary organizations such as the London Police Court Mission later known as the Rainer Foundation, These earlier probation services provided the inspiration for similar ideas in the humane treatment and supervision of offenders throughout the British Empire and also in former colonies of Britain as missionaries and members of the British criminal justice system travelled the globe. In modern times the duties of probation officers in the U.K. are to supervise offenders released on licence from custody, and to supervise offenders given non-custodial supervisory sentences at court. The work involves focuses on the management of risk of serious harm associated with offenders; on sentence planning and the selection and delivery of a range of interventions aimed at reducing reoffending; and on supervising, and variously devising, delivering or subcontracting schemes by which offenders having \\"Community Payback\\" sentences can discharge their requirement to perform unpaid work. Probation officers are also charged with providing a variety of reports on offenders throughout their criminal justice lifecycle, such as pre- sentence reports making recommendations on interventions likely to reduce the likelihood of reoffending or of causing serious harm; pre-release reports making recommendations on licence conditions or other interventions necessary for offenders being considered for release on licence; and parole reports advising the Parole Board of the probation service view of the offender suitability for release. Such reports will typically provide assessments of the criminal, the nature of crimes and effect on victims, the criminogenic needs and risk of serious harm associated with the individual, and will normally be based in part on an Offender Assessment System analysis. Probation officers are also responsible for the provision of regular reports to courts of the progress of offenders on orders having drug testing requirements. Additionally, probation officers will supervise a Restorative Justice plan that provides the victim of a crime an opportunity to address the impact of the crime to the offenders. Probation officers are responsible for recalling offenders who have been released on licence and have breached their licence conditions, and to return offenders on community payback orders to court for re-sentencing in the event of breaches of the terms of the order. The English & Welsh system has two levels of officer, the Probation Officer, and the Probation Service Officer - the latter will normally have less training than the former, and will be limited to supervising offenders at low and medium risk of serious harm. Probation in Malta Malta has its very own Probation Services that form part of the Department of Correctional Services within the Ministry of Justice & Home Affairs. The Probation Services has been in existence since 1957 and the first ever Probation Order was granted in 1961. There is no Parole as yet in Malta, however earlier this year a bill introducing parole has been presented in parliament. The Maltese Probation Services gives services both at the pre-sentencing and post sentencing stages in accordance to the Probation Act (Chap. 446, Laws of Malta). Services include Probation Order, Suspended Sentence Supervision Order, Community service order, Combination Order, Provisional Order of Supervision, Pre Sentencing Report, & Social Inquiry Report. Probation in Thailand Probation in Thailand is currently under the auspices Department of Probation, Ministry of Justice, Thailand. It has been developed through various amendment and enactment of laws and regulation along with the advancement of knowledge within criminal justice and criminology sphere. The probation system was firstly introduced into Thailand in 1952 and applied to the Juvenile Detention Centre under the Juvenile and Family Court. In 1956, the use of probation was explicitly stipulated for the first time in the modern Criminal Code of Thailand as a condition of sentence or punishment in adult criminal cases. Probation was never formally invoked, however, until the Proceedings of Probation Act 1979 was enacted which was nearly twenty years later with the establishment of the first probation office, Central Probation Office, was also established correspondingly as a division within the Office of Judicial Affairs under the Criminal Court, Ministry of Justice. In 1992, the Central Probation Office was elevated to be part of the Department of Probation separated from the court with the main roles and responsibilities in adult probationers under suspension of sentence or punishment. Responsibility for juvenile probation was then transferred to the Department of Juvenile Observation and Protection and probation for parolees was transferred to the Department of Corrections under Ministry of Interior. The fragmentation of responsibilities led to the revision of agencies roles and responsibilities in 2001 when the Cabinet has issued a resolution to re-organise probation works and the Department of Probation was proposed to be the main agency in charge of pretrial, trial and posttrial probation only for adult offender, the aftercare service and drug rehabilitation for offenders to the Department. In 2016, further the promulgation of the Probation Act 2016 significantly ameliorates and consolidates roles and responsibilities of the Department and probation officers whilst offering better mechanism in order to support the essence of the implementation of non-custodial measure and rehabilitation of offenders. The work of drug addict rehabilitation is currently in the transition to the Ministry of Public Health. Probation and parole in the United States A probation and parole officer with the Missouri Department of Corrections interviews a drug-related offense probationer. In the United States, probation officers exist at the city, county, state, and federal levels, that is, wherever there is a court of competent jurisdiction. Since the abolishment of parole in the federal system in 1984, there are no longer any federal parole officers. However, there is a small and decreasing number of parolees still being supervised that were sentenced prior to 1984, including court-martialed military personnel; U.S. probation officers serve as parole officers for those cases. Generally, probation officers investigate an offender's personal and criminal history for the court prior to sentencing and then may supervise defendants who have been sentenced to probation but not to a term of incarceration (unless, of course, the conditions of probation are violated). They may also serve arrest warrants, but can perform any other function assigned by the court. On the other hand, parole officers supervise offenders that have served a prison term, but who have subsequently been paroled, or released from prison under supervision; this decision is made after the review and consideration of an inmate's case by a warden, parole board or other parole authority. Parolees are essentially serving the remainder of their prison sentence in the community. However, some jurisdictions are modifying or abolishing the practice of parole and giving post-release supervision obligations to a community corrections agent, often generically if imprecisely referred to as a probation officer. Other jurisdictions are expanding a parole officer's duties to include post- incarceration supervision under special sentencing, such as convictions requiring sex offender registration, civil commitments, and violent offenders. These cases involve persons who have completed their incarceration, but who must be supervised under the special sentence for three years, or even for life, as in the case with Community Supervision for Life sentencing for sex offenders. In some states, due to the heightened danger to the public, these cases are supervised by parole officers rather than probation officers since parole officers are more commonly trained in police academies and carry firearms. Probation and parole officers are required to possess excellent oral and written communication skills, a broad knowledge of the criminal justice system. This includes knowledge of the roles, relationships, and responsibilities that are distributed among the government agencies and outside organizations. Government agencies include the courts, the parole authority, the Bureau of Prisons or Department of Corrections, local jails, the prosecuting attorneys, and other police agencies. Outside organizations may include legal services, substance abuse counseling and social services agencies. Officers must understand applicable case law and sentencing guidelines (if applicable). Additionally, they must have an ability to work with an extremely diverse population of individuals, convicted of various crimes, and also work with a wide variety of government agencies and community organizations. Finally, they must accept the potential hazards of working closely with a criminal population. Most jurisdictions require officers to have a four-year bachelor's degree, and prefer a graduate degree for full consideration for probation officer positions on the federal level. Probation officers are usually issued a badge or some other form of credentials and, in some cases, may carry concealed weapons or pepper spray for self-protection. Parole officers, in many jurisdictions, are issued a badge, credentials, and firearm, and often have full police powers. Probation and parole officers in positions that have law enforcement power must attend a police academy as part of their training and certification, and are technically classified as peace officers. Typically, probation and parole officers do not wear uniforms, but dress in business or casual attire. The structure of probation agencies varies from state to state. Traditionally, probation agencies have a loosely based paramilitary command structure, and are usually headed by a chief probation officer or director. The chain-of-command usually flows to deputy chief or assistant director, then to supervisor or senior probation officer, then to the line probation officer. In some states however, probation departments are seconded under a county sheriff, and probation officers may be uniformed and integrated into the paramilitary structure of the agency. In both systems, some parole and probation officers supervise general caseloads with offenders who are convicted of a variety of offenses. Others officers, particularly in urban populations, may hold specialized caseload positions, and work with specific groups of offenders such as sex offenders, offenders sentenced to electronic monitoring (house arrest) or GPS monitoring, and cases with severe mental health, substance abuse and/or violent histories. In some states and localities, probation departments have a specialized officer position known as a surveillance officer or field supervision officer. These officers have full probation officer authority, are sometimes peace officers, with arrest authority, and are badged and occasionally armed.

He also played at county level in England at both soccer and hockey. At cricket—his primary sport—he played over four hundred first-class matches in a twenty-four-year career. The majority of these matches were for his county side, Somerset, whom he captained from 1894 to 1906. A. A. Thomson described him thus: \\"Sammy ... radiated such elemental force in hard hitting, fast bowling and electrical fielding that he might have been the forerunner of Sir Learie Constantine.\\"A. A. Thomson, Cricketers of My Time, 1967, p. 160. Having moved to England at the age of sixteen to complete his education, Woods became entrenched in English sport. Having already played cricket and rugby growing up in Australia, at Brighton College he began playing soccer, and while still at the college, represented Sussex at the sport. Woods was also part of a strong cricket team at the college; in the 23 matches he played for them, only two were lost. He made his first-class cricket debut shortly after leaving Brighton College, in August 1886, playing for GN Wyatt's XI against the touring Australians. Later in the same month he made his first appearance for Somerset, a second-class match against Warwickshire. At Cambridge University he achieved blues in both cricket and rugby. Woods played the first three of his six Test cricket matches during his first year at Cambridge, called up to the Australian squad to face England in 1888 after Sammy Jones contracted smallpox. During this early part of his career, Woods was considered among the finest bowlers in England, and was named as one of the 'Six Great Bowlers of the Year' (later to form the inaugural Wisden Cricketers of the Year) in 1889. He twice claimed in excess of a hundred first-class wickets in an English season, and averaged under twenty in five consecutive seasons from 1888. In an 1890 match for Cambridge University, Woods claimed all ten of the opposition's wickets in the second-innings. However, by the time he was selected as part of the England Test squad to tour South Africa in 1895–96, his bowling was beginning to lose its potency. Additionally curtailed by injuries, Woods claimed five wickets on the tour, thirty less than the leading wicket-taker George Lohmann. While his bowling worsened, his batting improved; in 133 first-class matches up to the end of 1894, Woods scored one century, while in his next 129 matches he passed a hundred on fourteen occasions. Primarily an aggressive batsman, Woods had fast footwork and was capable of powerful strokes all around the ground, though he favoured the square cut. His twelve-year Somerset captaincy is the longest at the county. He was an attacking captain, once observing: \\"Draws? They're only for bathing in.\\"\\"The story of Somerset\\" – Wisden article with much on Woods Retrieved 20 May 2011 He also served the club as secretary from 1920 to 1922. Growing up in Australia Samuel Moses James, or Sammy as he commonly came to be known, was born to John Woods and Margaret Ewing on 13 April 1867. His parents, both born and raised in Ireland, had emigrated to Australia in 1853 shortly after their wedding. At the time of their wedding, John Woods was described as a 'labourer', but by the birth of Samuel Woods, he was listed as a 'gentleman', having carried out various contracts in the development of Sydney, and served as the city's mayor for a term in 1865.Jiggens (1997), pp8–9. Sammy Woods was one of five boys all of whom were athletic, and at the age of ten he played a match for an under-16s team captained by one of his elder brothers. A boy short for the match, Sammy was enlisted; he scored a few runs in each innings and claimed three wickets, and was afterwards presented with a cap by his brother, which he later claimed to prize more than even his international caps. Woods was educated at Royston College and Sydney Grammar School, and while at Royston once claimed seven wickets in seven balls. One school season, he claimed seventy wickets at an average of five runs.Jiggens (1997), pp9–11. Woods often missed school to watch cricket, and recounts that on more than one occasion he \\"got a jolly good caning\\".Jiggens (1997), p13. On one such occasion when he was 14, during the English tour of Australia of 1881–82, after buying a couple of the England team drinks, he bowled at George Ulyett in the nets. He played a number of matches for the Manly cricket club, taking part in challenge matches which on occasion included famous cricketers of the day such as Fred Spofforth and Billy Murdoch.Jiggens (1997), pp12–14. Education in England =Brighton College= Sammy Woods When he was aged 16, Woods' father decided to send him and his younger brother, Harris, to complete their education in England. Both boys were sent to Silwood House in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, a preparatory school. While at the school, Woods played for the town cricket club, and by the end of the season he was seventh in the published batting averages, with a top-score of 42 not out. He joined Brighton College in August 1884, and after playing a couple of cricket matches, the weather turned and the football season began. For Woods, whose Australian upbringing had consisted of cricket in the summer and rugby in the winter, the realisation that 'soccer' was played at the school was one made with some dismay. After only a few weeks though, he was playing in goal for both the school and the Sussex county football team.Jiggens (1997), p19. His newly discovered prowess at soccer did not detract from his cricketing skills. The two summers in which Woods played for Brighton College were strong ones for the school, of the 23 matches they played, only 2 were lost. Alongside the Woods brothers were a number of other players who would go on to appear in county cricket; George Cotterill and George Wilson both played for Sussex, while Leslie Gay made one Test appearance for England in addition to representing Hampshire and Somerset. Woods topped the bowling averages in both his years at the school; in the first he claimed 59 wickets at an average just over eight, figures which he improved upon during his second year when he took 78 wickets at an average of 7.3. His college reports commented much more favourably on his sporting achievements than his academic ones, praising his batting, bowling and fielding alike.Jiggens (1997), pp19–20. The highlight of Woods' time at Brighton College was during a schools match against Lancing College. Playing away from home at the West Sussex school, Woods claimed 8 wickets for 17 in the first-innings, with all his victims being bowled, and followed this with 6 for 10 in the second-innings, five of the wickets bowled, and the other caught and bowled. On another occasion playing for the College's first eleven, Woods hit the stumps eight times in eight balls, but only claimed three wickets. After three successive no-balls hit, he bowled an opponent with the fourth ball (the first legal ball of the over), hit the leg stump without dislodging a bail with the fifth, took successive wickets with the sixth and seventh, and then once again hit the stumps without disturbing the bails with the eighth.Jiggens (1997), p20. This was not the only time on which Woods hit the stumps without removing the bails: in an interview a few years later, he recalls a match against Dulwich College in which he \\"[hit] the leg stump – and [hit] it hard – three times in one over, without knocking the bails off\\", each ball then went for four byes.Jiggens (1997), p21. During his time at the college, Woods developed a slower ball after watching George Lohmann bowling against Sussex. Woods claimed that after practising the delivery for hours, he took a wicket with the first one he ever bowled, dismissing GG Hearne caught and bowled in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Ground. Woods left Brighton College in 1886, aged 19, and shortly after, in August of the same year, he made his first-class cricket debut. Playing for GN Wyatt's XI against the touring Australians, Woods opened the bowling in both innings for the English side which was termed a 'South of England XI'. Woods made scores of 21 and 11 with the bat, and took 2/45 and 0/40 bowling. He claimed that he strained his side trying to bowl too fast, and would have done better otherwise.Jiggens (1997), pp21–22. =Somerset: Learning business habits= After completing his time at Brighton College, Woods moved to Bridgwater where a friend of his father's helped to find him a job as a bank clerk. Woods reflected in his reminiscences that his father wanted him to \\"learn business habits\\" before he went to university. He soon became a key figure in the town's sport, playing for both the cricket and rugby teams. His performances on the cricket field drew the attention of the county club, and late during the 1886 season, Woods made his first appearance for Somerset County Cricket Club. Somerset were not at the time a first-class county, and Woods travelled up to Edgbaston, Birmingham to play Warwickshire, who similarly lacked first-class status. He failed in both batting innings, collecting a pair, but claimed twelve wickets; 7/23 in the first-innings and 5/34 in the second. His performance was praised in the Somerset County Gazette and in the Sussex Daily News; the latter publication noting that many had \\"anticipated or hoped that he would ultimately render good service to Sussex.\\"Jiggens (1997), pp23–25. He continued to play for Somerset in 1887, generally batting as part of the lower order. He collected ten wickets against the Marylebone Cricket Club during this time. His work experience at the bank ended when an inspector noticed that the books were not balancing; which Woods was happy to explain was due to him taking a sovereign from time to time to buy stamps. After losing this job, he paid a surveyor to teach him the trade, but after an afternoon of the training, his teacher ran off with the money and soon committed suicide, bringing that to a halt.Jiggens (1997), pp25–26. Cambridge University =First year= The Gatehouse of Jesus College, Cambridge, where Woods spent four years. Woods entered Jesus College, Cambridge in 1888 and soon became a vibrant part of the social community. He joined port wine and oyster clubs, (known as Rhadegund and the Natives respectively) and played both cricket and rugby during his time at the university. He had also applied to Oxford University, who had turned him down, not realising his sporting abilities.Jiggens (1997), pp30–31. He made his debut for the university at Fenner's in May 1888, claiming his first five- wicket haul in first-class cricket when he bowled four members of CI Thornton's XI, and had another one caught. Despite his wickets, he was relatively expensive, and the visiting side beat Cambridge easily. A week later, Woods improved on his performance against a 'Gentlemen of England' side which was also captained by Thornton, and claimed seven wickets in the first innings and another five in the second innings, top-scoring with the bat for Cambridge in-between, to help the university to a six wicket victory. This match also saw Woods take the only first-class hat-trick of his career.Jiggens (1997), p33. He continued to bowl effectively for the university side, claiming another twelve wickets during a match against Yorkshire, nine of the twelve being bowled. He topped both the batting and the bowling averages for Cambridge during his first year, and gained his Blue in cricket, claiming six wickets in Oxford University's only innings of a match that was drawn, due to rain, with Cambridge the better of the two sides. In Geoffrey Bolton's History of the O.U.C.C., the author offers the opinion that the Cambridge side relied on the bowling of Woods, and although the rain initially softened the ground too much for his fast bowling, \\"when it had dried, he was irresistible.\\"Bolton (1962), p128. He also gained a Blue in rugby union, despite breaking his collarbone in an early game for the university. He also gained colours for Jesus College in both rugby and soccer.Jiggens (1997), p30–31. During his first year at Cambridge, Woods made his first appearances in the Gentlemen v Players fixture, representing the Gentlemen at both Lord's and The Oval in early July. In the first of the two matches, he claimed five wickets in each innings to help secure the Gentlemen a narrow five run victory. He collected another five wickets in the first innings of the match at The Oval, but could not prevent the Players achieving an innings victory, scoring a duck in the first innings and six runs in the second. =Test debut= During 1888, the sixth Australian team formed and travelled to England to contest three Tests and over 30 first-class matches. The squad was considered to be relatively weak, particularly in the batting, where only four players had any experience of English conditions. H.S Altham described them as leaving Australia \\"amid a chorus of gloomy prophecy\\". In his reminiscences, W. G. Grace expressed his disappointment at George Giffen and Harry Moses, who he rated as Australia's best players, not travelling with the team, and also noted that they missed the bowling of Fred Spofforth.Grace (1899), pp198–201. Sammy Jones, an all- rounder from Sydney, fell ill with smallpox early during the tour, and due to the Australians only having a thirteen-man squad, Woods was invited into the tourists squad.Jiggens (1997), p34. His debut for Australia was made just two days after the conclusion of the second of his appearances for the Gentlemen, and was in the first Test of the series. Woods scored 18 and 3 batting from number six, and claimed one wicket during the first innings; the only wicket taken by Australia that did not fall to either Charlie Turner or John Ferris during the match. The match was notable for having the lowest aggregate number of runs scored in a Test match; Australia scored 116 and 60, while England made 53 and 62, totalling 291 runs. The record stood until 1932 when South Africa and Australia totalled less, but remains the second lowest aggregate. Woods appeared against the Australians shortly thereafter, playing for 'Cambridge University Past and Present', but rejoined them for matches against Yorkshire and Surrey, the latter of which drew his best performance for the Australians, when he claimed four wickets, over a third of his total for the side. He claimed two wickets in each of the other two Test matches, but failed to reach double figures when batting in any innings. Australia lost both matches, granting England a 2–1 series victory. Grace observed that \\"neither with bat nor ball did Mr. S. M. J. Woods give promise of the sterling qualities of which he proved himself the possessor as years went on. Woods, in his reminiscences, only provides a paragraph on his time playing for the Australians, and concentrates mainly on the first-ball duck he made in the match at Old Trafford, Manchester.Woods (1925), pp 31–32. These three Test appearances for Australia were the only he made for his native country; he was invited to play for them again when they toured England in 1890, but had to decline due to injury.Jiggens (1997), p35. In 1889, Woods was named by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of the \\"Six Great Bowlers of the Year\\" due to his performances for Cambridge and Australia. His bowling is described in the piece as being \\"very fast right-hand, now and then sending in a good yorker.\\" =Second year= Gregor MacGregor while at Cambridge. In his second year at Cambridge, Woods continued his good bowling form from the previous season. He picked up five first innings wickets in his second match of the year, against the Marylebone Cricket Club, and in his next match a couple of day later, achieved his best bowling analysis in an innings to that point, claiming eight wickets against AJ Webbe's XI. He claimed another eleven wickets in the match against Yorkshire, taking five in the first innings and six in the second. Despite his wicket taking, Cambridge only won three of their seven first-class encounters in the run-up to facing Oxford, and the last of those came without Woods in the side. Nevertheless, they entered the fixture with better results than Oxford, who had lost six of their seven matches. Woods proved one of the deciding factors, claiming eleven wickets in the match, of which seven were bowled, and two were in combination with wicket-keeper Gregor MacGregor. Cambridge opening batsman Henry Mordaunt scored 127 in the match, and they secured an innings victory, requiring just two of the three allocated days. The partnership which MacGregor and Woods forged during their time at Cambridge was noted by Bolton, who commented that \\"the two most successful Cambridge bowlers, Steel and Woods, were partnered by their two greatest wicket-keepers, Alfred Lyttelton and MacGregor.\\"Bolton (1962), p127. The pair shared a room together at Jesus College for two years, and on the field MacGregor proved himself capable of standing up to the wicket against Woods' bowling. Teammate Digby Jephson described their partnership as having \\"machine-like precision ... the faster Sam bowled, the nearer the sticks stood Mac.\\"Jiggens (1997), pp38–39. After the conclusion of the university term, Woods played five further five-class fixtures, as well as a number of matches for Somerset. He performed well, but without much note in the two Gentlemen v Players fixtures in London, claiming three wickets in an innings twice, but both games resulted in victories for the Players. Four appearances for Somerset in August brought him more wickets, although the cricket was not first-class; he took five wickets in an innings three times, and totalled 33 wickets in the matches. He continued this wicket-taking form into his next two matches, both first-class, taking seven wickets in the second innings against I Zingari for the Gentlemen of England, aggregating eleven wickets in the match, and a few days later he claimed ten wickets in a match for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Yorkshire. He completed his second full season of first-class cricket with 74 wickets, at a bowling average of 16.74, roughly equivalent to his figure from the previous season. =Third year= Woods took on the captaincy of the university side during his third year, a role he had taken up twice before in 1889. In the first match of the season, he put in the best bowling display of his career; in his third annual match against CI Thornton's XI, Woods took five wickets in the first innings, and after his teammates had built a 62 run lead, he then proceeded to claim all ten of the opposition's wickets in the second innings, bowling seven of them. His figures of ten wickets for 69 runs were his career best in an innings. Woods was troubled by strains throughout the summer of 1890, and so despite playing as many matches as the previous season, he bowled over 30% fewer deliveries. When he did bowl, he was still effective, claiming 59 wickets at an average of 13.13, his best during an English season. In the matches leading up to the fixture against Oxford, Woods' Cambridge side won three, loss three and drew one of their seven games, and were considered to be a stronger side than their rivals.Bolton (1962), pp133–135. Rain prevented any play on the first day, and the soft conditions did not favour Woods' bowling. He picked up four wickets in each innings, but more significantly, Oxford were restricted to 42 in their first innings. Cambridge did not manage to score any quicker in their reply, but did bat for longer open up a lead of 55 runs. An improved display from Oxford in the second innings left Cambridge requiring 54 runs to win, which they reached with an hour of the match remaining. During 1890, Somerset played thirteen 'second-class' fixtures, and remained undefeated for the whole season.Foot (1986), pp26–28. Woods, due to his commitments at Cambridge and his injuries, only appeared in three of these matches. In the matches in which he did play, Woods made a significant impact: he claimed seven wickets in the first innings against Leicestershire, and in total in the three matches for the county, he took 24 wickets. In late August, playing for the Gentlemen of England against I Zingari at the Scarborough Festival, Woods claimed 12 wickets in the match, opening the bowling alongside W. G. Grace. =Fourth year= Woods and Stanley Jackson took the majority of wickets for Cambridge during the year, with Woods at his deadliest against Surrey in a two-day match in the middle of June. Though he bowled typically expensively, he claimed seven wickets in each innings, bowling nine men, helping Cambridge to a 19 run victory. He also top-scored with the bat for Cambridge in their second innings, hitting 27 runs. According to Bolton, Cambridge once again had a superior side in the University Match, but despite this strength, they very nearly lost the contest.Bolton (1962), pp136–139. Their strong batting line-up reached 210, which Bolton claims \\"could not be called a formidable score.\\" In Oxford's innings, Woods bowled at what is claimed to be the quickest of his career, collecting seven wickets. Oxford were all out for 108, and MacGregor, captaining Cambridge, enforced the follow on. Oxford batted better in their second innings, but Cambridge only required 90 runs to win to match. A combination of nerves and poor light resulted in Cambridge collapsing, and when MacGregor was dismissed, only two wickets remained with the scores level. Woods, who had not been ready to bat, ran to the wicket without pads or gloves, and hit the first ball he was delivered for a boundary to long- on.Jiggens (1997), p46–47. Woods led the Cambridge bowling averages in each of the four seasons that he played at the university, and in 28 first-class matches for the side he claimed 190 wickets at an average of 14.93, taking five wickets in an innings on 19 occasions, and ten wickets in a match seven times. In contrast to his sporting excellence, he struggled academically, and left Cambridge without a degree. County cricket =Entry into County Championship= Vanity Fair, 1892 After Somerset's achievements in the previous season, they were granted first-class status and admission to the County Championship in 1891.Foot (1986), p28. This resulted in Woods playing more first-class cricket than in any previous season. He continued to bowl well throughout the season, and finished as Somerset's leading wicket taker in the Championship in 1891, claiming 72 of his 134 wickets for the county. He took ten wickets, and scored a half-century in the match against Yorkshire at Park Avenue, Bradford, and in so doing reached 100 first-class wickets in a season for the first time. Later in the same month, Woods opened the Somerset bowling alongside Ted Tyler against Gloucestershire. The pair claimed five wickets each, bowling Somerset's local rivals out for 25 runs from just 14.2 overs. The total was the lowest score Gloucestershire had made in an innings to that point, and remains their third lowest total. Woods claimed a further three wickets in Gloucestershire's second innings, and Somerset completed an innings victory on day two of the match. Lord Hawke led the first of his cricketing tours following the conclusion of the 1891 English cricket season, taking a small party of English amateurs to play eight matches in North America. The first match of the trip was a first-class contest against the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, and the tourists lost by eight wickets. Woods blamed the defeat on being too soon after arriving, claiming the team \\"had hardly found our land-legs.\\"Woods (1925), p45. The loss was considered something of an embarrassment to English cricket, and prompted a number of letters to be written to Lord Hawke expressing dismay at the result. Wisden primarily attributed the loss to the poor performance of Woods,Jiggens (1997), p57. whose four wickets came at an expense of 124. He fared significantly better in the second match, having apparently found his 'land-legs'. He collected 15 wickets for 86 runs against the same opponents, and the visitors won by four wickets. A third, deciding, match was proposed between the two sides, but could not be fit into the schedule. The remainder of the matches on the tour were not first-class, and were rarely eleven-a-side contests. Woods collected numerous wickets during these matches, and made significant totals with the bat on a couple of occasions, scoring 92 against 'All New York', and 54 in the last match, against 'Eastern Ontario'. * Leading wicket-taker in 1892 =Captaincy= * Became captain in 1894 following resignation of Hewett. * Longest serving captain, staying in the role until 1906. =Tests for England in SA= * Three test appearances in 1896 for England during tour of SA. =Batting for Somerset= * Somerset's leading run-scorer in 1897 and 1899. Playing style =Bowling= In an appreciation included as a foreword to Woods' reminiscences, Pelham Warner described Woods as being \\"at that time one of the great fast bowlers of the world.\\"Pelham Warner in Woods (1925), pp1–4. Warner was referring to a match playing in 1890, when Woods was near the peak of his bowling. Warner was not the only one to rate Woods so highly, he was selected as one of the \\"Six Great Bowlers of the Year\\" by Wisden in 1889 for his performances in the previous season. He did not spend long at this peak though; he averaged below twenty in each of his first five full seasons, from 1888 until 1892, but did not manage the feat again during an English season. When he was at his best, C. B. Fry described Woods as \\"one of the best fast bowlers of all time\\". During his early years of first-class cricket, Woods focussed on bowling as quickly as possible, often sacrificing accuracy to achieve this. He soon developed into a more accurate and tactical bowler, including variety intentionally.Jiggens (1997), pp36–37. The slower ball that Woods developed after watching George Lohmann became a vital part of his attack, and Warner believed it was this ball, and his ability to disguise it, that was \\"what made him a really great bowler\\". Wisden praised his yorker, while he was also known to bowl occasional bouncers, and even a beamer, and though some claimed these were intentional, Warner insisted otherwise. Woods was described by Grace as having \\"a high action\\".Grace (1899), p397. During the mid-1890s, Woods lost some of his pace, most likely burnt out from bowling long spells at his quickest during his years at Cambridge University. Rugby career When Woods moved to Bridgwater in 1886 after completing his time at Brighton College, he almost immediately began playing for the town's rugby team.Jiggens (1997), p23. He described his first two seasons with the club as being wonderful, especially 1887, in which Bridgwater only lost one match, the last of the season against Exeter.Woods (1925), pp24–29. He began his time at the club as a three-quarters back, and was soon called into the Somerset side for their first tour of the north of England.Jiggens (1997), pp26–27. He recounts that during their match against Lancashire, he started at fullback, but after making a number of mistakes, moved to three-quarters. From this position he scored a dropped goal which helped to turn the match around, and thanks to two tries from his teammates, Somerset won. He selected to play for the South in 1888, and although England did not compete internationally that year due to disputes between the national boards, Woods was disappointed not to be chosen as part of the \\"imaginary XV\\". At Cambridge, he gained his Blue, competing in the Varsity Match in each of 1888, 1889 and 1900. Woods played over 30 times for Somerset, and captained the county between 1893 and 1896. Woods was often a guest of the Hancock family, and appeared a number of times for Wiveliscombe, for whom seven of the ten Hancock brothers also appeared. One of these brothers, Froude Hancock, played for Blackheath, travelling up to London and back each weekend to appear for them. Woods joined him on occasion, and soon became an irregular player, appearing for the side throughout the early 1890s. Around the same time, Woods became one of the founding members of the Barbarians, and served on the club's committee for some time.Jiggens (1997), pp64–65. His England debut came in 1890, appearing against Wales at Dewsbury. Woods was one of eight England debutants in the match, in which he played as a forward. Wales won the match by a single try. He played in both of England's other two 1890 Home Nations Championship matches, both of which were won by England, who shared the championship with Scotland. He played all three matches again in 1891. He captained England for the first time in 1892, leading his adopted country to a 7–0 victory over Ireland, kicking a goal. He captained them again in 1893, but took on the captaincy on a more permanent basis in 1895, taking charge of the team for all three Home Nations matches. He scored his only international try in England's opening match of the 1895 competition, during a 14–6 victory over Wales. England won the second match, against Ireland at Lansdowne Road, but lost the final match of the tournament against Scotland – England's only loss with Woods as captain. =Style of play= Playing as either a back or a forward, Woods was praised primarily for his dribbling, part of the game which he felt should be utilised more often, especially by the pack during a ruck, or following a scrum.Jiggens (1997), pp66–67. Woods was described by W. G. Grace as being \\"not a good scrimmager\\", but the England pack during his captaincy was considered one of the country's greatest for decades after. He was known for his strong tackling, described by an 1892 publication, Football, the Rugby Union Game, as \\"exceedingly severe\\", while Gilbert Jessop joked that an opponent may prefer to be hit by a motor- car than tackled by Woods in a close match. World War I Woods served initially as a temporary lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Fusiliers before transferring to the Devon Regiment in 1916. In 1917 he was transferred to the Labour Corps. He was forced to resign his commission on 14 March 1919 due to ill-health and was given the substantive rank of captain. Later life He remained a very popular and well-known figure in Somerset even after his cricket-playing days were long over. When he died, Taunton was in a state of mourning. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow wrote of him: \\"If you wanted to know Taunton, you walked round it with Sam Woods on a summer morning before the match. Sam was Somerset's godfather.\\"R.C.

His known mathematical works included his commentaries on Euclid's Elements, Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder and Menelaus' Sphaerica,* Roshdi Rashed and Athanase Papadopoulos, 2017 as well as two independent treatises. He unsuccessfully tried to solve a problem posed by Archimedes of cutting a sphere into two volumes of a given ratio, which was later solved by 10th century mathematician Abū Ja'far al-Khāzin. His only known surviving work on astronomy was on the calculation of azimuths. He was also known to make astronomical observations, and claimed his estimates of the start times of three consecutive lunar eclipses were accurate to within half an hour.  Biography  Historians know little of Al-Mahani's life due to lack of sources. He was born in Mahan, Persia (hence the Nisba Al-Mahani). He was active in the 9th century CE or 3rd century AH, lived in Baghdad c. 860 and died c. 880. From a reference in Ibn Yunus' Hakimite Tables, he was known to make astronomical observations between 853 and 866, allowing historians to estimate the time of his life and activities. Works =Mathematics= His works on mathematics covered the topics of geometry, arithmetic, and algebra. Some of his mathematical work might have been motivated by problems he encountered in astronomy. The 10th century catalogue Kitab al-Fihrist mentions al-Mahani's contributions in mathematics but not those in astronomy. He also worked on current mathematical problems at his time. He wrote commentaries on Greek mathematical works: Euclid's Elements, Archimedes' On the Sphere and Cylinder and Menelaus' Sphaerica. In his commentaries he added explanations, updated the language to use \\"modern\\" terms of his time, and reworked some of the proofs. He also wrote a standalone treatise Fi al-Nisba (\\"On Relationship\\") and another on the squaring of parabola. His commentaries on the Elements covered Books I, V, X and XII; only those on Book V and parts of those on book X and XII survive today. In the Book V commentary, he worked on ratio, proposing a theory on the definition of ratio based on continued fractions that was later discovered independently by Al-Nayrizi. In the Book X commentary, he worked on irrational numbers, including quadratic irrational numbers and cubic ones. He expanded Euclid's definition of magnitudes—which included only geometrical lines—by adding integers and fractions as rational magnitudes as well as square and cubic roots as irrational magnitudes. He called square roots \\"plane irrationalities\\" and cubic roots \\"solid irrationalities\\", and classified the sums or differences of these roots, as well as the results of the roots' additions or subtractions from rational magnitudes, also as irrational magnitudes. He then explained Book X using those rational and irrational magnitudes instead of geometric magnitudes like in the original. His commentaries of the Sphaerica covered book I and parts of book II, none of which survive today. His edition was later updated by Ahmad ibn Abi Said al-Harawi (10th century). Later, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) dismissed Al-Mahani and Al-Harawi's edition and wrote his own treatment of the Sphaerica, based on the works on Abu Nasr Mansur. Al-Tusi's edition became the most widely known edition of the Sphaerica in the Arabic-speaking world. Al- Mahani also attempted to solve a problem posed by Archimedes in On the Sphere and Cylinder, book II, chapter 4: how to divide a sphere by a plane into two volumes of a given ratio. His work led him to an equation, known as \\"Al- Mahani's equation\\" in the Muslim world: x^3 + c^2b = cx^2 . However, as documented later by Omar Khayyam, \\"after giving it lengthy meditation\\" he eventually failed to solve the problem. The problem was then considered unsolvable until 10th century Persian mathematician Abu Ja'far al-Khazin solved it using conic sections. =Astronomy= His astronomical observations of conjunctions as well as solar and lunar eclipses was cited in the zij (astronomical tables) of Ibn Yunus (c. 950 – 1009). Ibn Yunus quoted Al-Mahani as saying that he calculated their timings with an astrolabe. He claimed his estimates of the start times of three consecutive lunar eclipses were accurate to within half an hour. He also wrote a treatise, Maqala fi ma'rifat as-samt li-aiy sa'a aradta wa fi aiy maudi aradta (\\"On the Determination of the Azimuth for an Arbitrary Time and an Arbitrary Place\\"), his only known surviving work on astronomy. In it, he provided two graphical methods and an arithmetic one of calculating the azimuth—the angular measurement of a heavenly object's location. The arithmetic method corresponds to the cosine rule in spherical trigonometry, and was later used by Al-Battani (c. 858 – 929). He wrote another treatise, whose title, On the Latitude of the Stars, is known but its content is entirely lost. According to later astronomer Ibrahim ibn Sinan (908–946), Al-Mahani also wrote a treatise on calculating the ascendant using a solar clock.

He joined the Imperial German Navy as an officer cadet in 1917 and served on a heavy cruiser in World War I. Puttkamer enlisted during World War I on 2 July 1917 as a volunteer in the Imperial Navy's 'Seeoffizierslaufbahn regiment. In December 1917 Puttkamer served on the battleship Kaiserin. In the final months of the war, Puttkamer graduated at the Naval Academy Mürwik in a navigation course. He then took leave and joined the Freikorps. In September 1920 Puttkamer returned to the Naval Academy. He was commissioned as an officer in 1923.

In September 1926, Puttkamer became commander of the torpedo boat under Karl Dönitz, a position he held until October 1930, where he was promoted to lieutenant-commander of the torpedo boat . In 1933 graduated as a naval liaison officer from the Mürwik Naval Academy. Shortly after this, he served as naval adjutant to the General Staff until June 1935. In July 1935, he was transferred to the staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. Puttkamer served as Hitler's naval adjutant until June 1938, when he was transferred to active service. the hospital after the failed 20 July plot Immediately prior to the outbreak of World War II in Europe, he was the captain of a destroyer.

Puttkamer was injured on 20 July 1944 when the bomb exploded during the 20 July plot attempt to kill Hitler and was awarded the 20 July Wound Badge.  Hitler's final days  At the end of January 1945 a Pomeranian Volkssturm battalion was commanded by Baron von Puttkamer. This force was commanded by officers in their World War I uniforms and old service pistols with farmers without weapons, only armed with their Volkssturm armbands. After the unit was unable to reach the city of Schneidemuhl to obtain arms and when their train took Soviet tank fire, Puttkamer returned his men to their village and determined that they were not going to throw lives away and \\"put away the old uniform, which become dishonored 'under these Hitlers and Himmlers' \\". On 20 April 1945, Hitler told his staff: \\"The situation during the last few days has changed to such an extent that I am forced to reduce my staff.\\" On 20 April, Puttkamer, Dr. Theodor Morell, Dr. Hugo Blaschke, Albert Bormann, secretaries Johanna Wolf, Christa Schroeder and several others were ordered by Hitler to leave Berlin by aircraft for the Obersalzberg. The group flew out of Berlin on different flights by aircraft of the Fliegerstaffel des Führers over the following three days. Puttkamer's flight left Berlin on 21 April. Puttkamer was ordered to the Berghof to destroy Hitler's papers and personal belongings there. Therefore, Puttkamer was not with Hitler during his final few days in the Führerbunker.

It was a dead-end terminus, located on the site of the present law courts complex. In November 1876, the railway was extended south to Winchelsea, necessitating the relocation of the station to the west, and between 1877 and 1881, the current station building was constructed. The station building was upgraded in 1988, and included new passenger waiting areas and booking offices. Until the 1990s, there was a goods yard, including a large goods shed, located on the eastern side of the station.Geelong Railway Station Complex National Trust of Australia (Victoria) It is now the site of Geelong's law courts and police station. A locomotive depot remains to the north, and carriage stabling sidings are to the west.

It serves the southern Geelong suburb of South Geelong, opening on 1 November 1883.South Geelong VicsigSouth Geelong Station Rail Geelong History The railway line to Winchelsea opened on 25 November 1876. Prior to South Geelong, the site was used as a loading point for ballast and bluestone loading point for a construction contractor, building the Queenscliff line. A wooden station building was provided at opening. Opposite the station was a loop siding, longer than the platform, and behind the station was a dead end siding. Around 1887–1888, the siding was extended, and a goods shed provided. A list of signals, dated around 1899, showed South Geelong having two home signals and two starters. In March 1900, the Staff and Ticket, between the sections Geelong - Queenscliff Junction - Mount Moriac, was replaced by electric staff. However, the station appeared to retain a block post between the station and Geelong, apparently so that trains can wait at the station, instead of at Queenscliff Junction. On 5 August 1901, Queenscliff Junction was abolished, with a new parallel line built next to the old line, effectively making South Geelong the junction to Queenscliff. An interlocking frame was also provided around this time, with the station building partially rebuilt, to accommodate the frame. After this, the large Electric staff was now Geelong \\"D\\" signalbox - South Geelong - Mount Moriac, while the branch Staff and Ticket became South Geelong - Drysdale. Alterations to arrangements for the Geelong Showgrounds and the Geelong Racecourse took place a few years later. The Racecourse, which was served by a short railway branch from Connewarre, moved to its present site in 1907, as well as the Showgrounds. They were served by a new siding and station. In 1912, the platform was extended at its eastern end, to accommodate the increasing length of trains. Similar platform extensions occurred at most stations along the line during the same year. During this time, nearby Moorabool Street was grade separated to the current day rail over road. A temporary loop was provided to allow trains to operate during works, with this arrangement operating until February 1913. 1914 saw alterations in the goods yard. The former Bellerine Street level crossing was closed, and replaced by a pedestrian overpass (now removed). This enabled the yard to be enlarged, with two long sidings parallel to the main running line, in the down direction, with a connection for down trains at the end of the platform. These sidings were brought into use in December 1914. In 1921, the station became a depot for gravel from the Gherang pits, which was located on the short Wensleydale branch line. Other industries along the nearby Barwon River used South Geelong as a base to receive their supplies. Seven years later, on 20 June 1928, Geelong - South Geelong was converted to Miniature Electric Staff, with South Geelong - Racecourse - Moriac converted on 18 September of the same year. An automatic staff exchanger was provided around 1930. The crossing of trains was generally avoided due to a lack of appropriate crossing facilities. Only on special occasions, such as holiday periods, trains were timed to cross. For example; on 24 December 1927, the 10.20 Warrnambool passenger service, due at South Geelong at 12.03, was due to cross the 09.35 passenger train from Camperdown, due at 12.02, and had to \\"wait for P3\\", P3 being the Warrnambool service. The train was then to wait on the Queenscliff branch line, subject to Rule 15 of Appendix VII, of the Book of Rules and Regulations. Therefore, the train, which had to wait, stood at the up home signal. This also prevented South Geelong giving Drysdale an electric staff for trains to approach, while a train waited for a cross, or shunting trains onto the branch line, while another train was approaching. Eventually, on 1 June 1931, passenger trains ceased on the Queenscliff line, and a week later, the Miniature Electric Staff was abolished. Drysdale was abolished as a staff station, and Staff and Ticket was re-introduced between South Geelong and Queenscliff. Gates at the nearby Swanston Street level crossing were provided in 1914. In 1934, the gatekeeper was given control, via a ground frame, of two arms on \\"Post 3\\". The gatekeeper also controlled two arms above the bracket distant signal on \\"Post 5\\". This arrangement lasted until 1976, when flashing lights were provided. Boom barriers were provided in 2009.Swanston Street Rail Geelong The former State Electricity Commission (SECV) opened a briquette depot nearby in 1940. This led to two new siding into the depot. In March of the same year, the siding was extended by about 200 yards, with the staff-locked connection between the siding and the main line also extended. This provided beneficial for trains using the station to move traffic to football games at the nearby Kardinia Park, which is located nearby in Moorabool Street. Up to seven trains could've been held in the yard. On 29 September 1959, siding \\"A\\", directly opposite the station, was abolished. The run-round loop was re-instated in 1982. Commencing on 4 November 1968, local passenger services from Geelong were extended to South Geelong, with the car park established, built on part of the goods siding. Initially, one train each way was provided during morning and afternoon peaks, usually followed by an empty car movement. By 1979, the number of local services to and from South Geelong had increased to eight a day, in both directions. In 1982, siding \\"A\\" was re-instated, and extended across the Yarra Street level crossing. The down end crossover was moved about approximately 175 feet. The down home signal was also moved. The points from the platform to the goods siding, now rarely used, and no longer holding empty car trains, could now be Annett locked. The automatic staff exchanger was also removed during 1982. The former Queenscliff branch, which closed in 1976, was now effectively siding \\"B\\". The controls for the down and up home signals were removed, and distant signal, \\"Post 7\\", in siding \\"B\\", was reduced to a single distant arm. In October 1983, the original wooden station building was demolished, and was replaced by the present station building, which opened on 30 September 1984. Two years later, in February 1986, boom barriers replaced hand-operated gates at the Yarra Street level crossing. Further signaling alterations occurred in 1992. Today, South Geelong is staffed part-time,South Geelong V/Line and is serviced by a majority of InterCity Geelong services. The former railway branch line to Queenscliff is now occupied by the Bellarine Rail Trail as far as Drysdale, and the Bellarine Peninsula Railway, between Drysdale and Queenscliff. The former Geelong Racecourse station was located between South Geelong and Marshall stations. The last service to use the station was in 2005. In February 2011, the loop siding was disconnected from the main line, as part of a sleeper renewal program.Geelong Racecourse Rail Geelong Platforms & services South Geelong has one platform.

The brewery was owned by the brewer Henry Weinhard of the Weinhard family, who also made a line of soft drinks which survives to this day. The Blitz-Weinhard brand was among several regional Pacific Northwest beers which were staples in that market during the decades following the repeal of Prohibition until they began losing market share to the national brands in the 1960s and 1970s. Advertising campaign Weinhard's created a unique and noteworthy advertising campaign in the late 1970s and 1980s to position its brand. The campaign featured a fictitious brand of beer called \\"Schludwiller\\" beer. A series of popular television commercials depicted Schludwiller as a beer brewed by the \\"California-Eastern Brewing Co.\\" in California. In one of the ads, a \\"border patrolman\\" played by actor Dick Curtis asked Earl and Vern (the drivers of the Schludwiller Beer truck) \\"Well now…where you fellas going with all that beer?\\" Schludwiller came complete with its own motto in Latin: Quod Nesciunt Sibi Damno Non Erit (roughly: \\"What they don't know won't hurt them\\"). The Henry Weinhard's brand, repositioned as a quality microbrew, was able to regain and sustain its popularity. However, its favored status with beer-drinkers was not enough to save the original Portland brewery from eventual closure. Like many businesses in the United States at the time, the Blitz-Weinhard brewery succumbed to purchase and resale by a number of companies in the late 20th century, including Pabst Brewing Company and Miller Brewing Company and now MillerCoors, the U.S. business unit of Molson Coors Brewing Company. Brewery Henry Weinhard Henry Weinhard's brewery, 1888 In 1862, Henry Weinhard moved to Portland, Oregon and purchased an old brewery on the corner of NW First and Davis, before moving in 1864 to a facility occupying two full blocks at NW 12th and Burnside.Brewery Blocks - Portland Oregon Brewery History This Blitz-Weinhard brewery in Portland survived as a production facility under several ownership changes until 1999, when it was sold by the Stroh Brewery Company to the Miller Brewing Company, who closed it down in late August. The brewery was a fixture of an old industrial and warehouse district which, beginning in the 1990s, has become known as the Pearl District in downtown Portland, and its closure marked the beginning of a massive urban rejuvenation project. Following the closure of the Portland brewery in 1999, Henry Weinhard's was brewed at the Olympia brewery in Tumwater, Washington until that brewery too was closed in 2003.
