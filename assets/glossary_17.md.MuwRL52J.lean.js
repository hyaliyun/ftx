He served as Secretary of the Worcester Liberal Association,The Times, 16 November 1922 p6 was a political agent and canvasser in the town and became a member of Worcester Council.The Times, 22 August 1906 p4 Fairbairn first stood for Parliament at the December 1910 general election, when he contested his home constituency of Worcester. He was successful in decreasing the Unionist's majority but failed to get elected.The Times House of Commons, 1911; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p58 In all, Fairbairn fought Worcester eight times for the Liberals. In 1918, the sitting Conservative MP was endorsed by the Coalition government and presumably received the Coalition Coupon, increasing his majority over Fairbairn.The Times House of Commons, 1919; Politico’s Publishing, 2004 p42 At the 1922 general election, however, Fairbairn achieved his only Parliamentary success. Although he faced a new Conservative candidate rather than the established MP of many years, Fairbairn managed to turn a Unionist majority of 4,554 into a Liberal majority of 773.The Times, 16 November 1922 p6 His Conservative opponent, the Hon. Henry Lygon, a scion of a well-known Worcestershire family, had been seen as a strong candidate for his party but it was reported that the Tories had been overconfident and internally divided,The Times, 23 November 1923 p15 and they seem to have paid the price. In 1923, Fairbairn faced yet another new face for the Conservatives at Worcester, Australian-born Crawford Green. Despite the revival in the country that the Liberal Party achieved at this election, now re-united around the traditional Liberal policy of Free trade,Chris Cook, A Short History of the Liberal Party, 1900-1992; Macmillan, 1993 pp93-94 Green won the seat by a majority of 1,228 votes.The Times, 7 December 1923 p6 Fairbairn was certainly persistent in his desire to represent Worcester again for the Liberals. He contested the seat again at the 1924, 1929, 1931 and 1935 general elections. He finished in second place to the Conservatives each time, except for 1929 when Labour overtook him; but never came close to regaining his seat.F W S Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949; Political Reference Publications, Glasgow, 1949 p284 Death Fairbairn died on 14 October 1941 while holding the office of Mayor of Worcester Worcestershire Record Office, Report of the County Archivist, Vols 26-30; 1970 p2 and having been granted the Freedom of the City in July that year.Denise Mylechreest, A Singular Liberal, Richard Robert Fairbairn and Worcester Politics, 1899-1941; MA Thesis, University of Coventry, 2007 p180 One academic has argued that by maintaining second position in the polls for the party in the face of any Labour challenge, Fairbairn ensured that Liberalism remained alive in Worcester at a time when the party was seen as increasingly irrelevant elsewhere.Denise Mylechreest, A Singular Liberal,p1 References Category:1867 births Category:1941 deaths Category:UK MPs 1922–1923 Category:Liberal Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Mayors of places in Worcestershire Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Worcester Category:Councillors in Worcestershire ","title":"Richard Robert Fairbairn"},{"id":"27101313","text":"Jaroslav \\"Jerry\\" Toth (15 November 1928 – 31 March 1999) was a Canadian saxophonist, clarinetist, flutist, arranger, composer, and record producer.

Maurice Strakosch (probably 15 January 1825 – 9 October 1887) was an American musician and impresario of Czech origin.Maurice Strakosch: North American Theatre Online Biography Strakosch was born in Gross-Seelowitz (today Židlochovice), Moravia. He made his debut as a pianist at the age of 11 in Brno performing a piano concerto by Hummel. Because his parents weren't satisfied with his career choice, he ran away to Vienna at the age of twelve, where he studied under Simon Sechter. He also studied singing under Giuditta Pasta for some time. In 1843, he met tenor Salvatore Patti (1800–1869) at a music festival in Vicenza. Five years later, he was tour manager of Patti group in New York. These performances started his successful career as a manager in the United States and his long-standing friendship with the Patti family. In 1852, Strakosch married Patti's daughter Amalia Patti. He was also the first manager of the youngest and most successful daughter, Adelina Patti, from her debut in 1859 until her marriage in 1868. It is believed that Strakosch was her most important teacher. Besides the Pattis, he and his brother Max (born in Brunn, Moravia, 27 September 1835; died in New York City, 17 March 1892) worked as impresario with Teresa Parodi, Christine Nilsson, Marie Heilbronn, Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa, Carlotta Patti, Karl Formes, Pasquale Brignoli, Italo Campanini, Pauline Lucca, Thérèse Tietjens, Louis M. Gottschalk, Clara Louise Kellogg, Marie Roze and Marietta Alboni. Strakosch occasionally performed as a pianist, e.g. he played duet with Ole Bull during his tour in America. In 1857, his opera Giovanna of Naples (Regina Giovanna di Napoli) was performed in New York. His compositions for the piano were at one time very popular, and among them the music of one of Bayard Taylor's songs. In 1886, he published a memoir book Souvenirs d'un impresario (Souvenirs of an Impresario). Strakosch died in Paris in 1887.

Patrilineal descent is the traditional principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Felipe were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robert, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house. Felipe is a member of the Spanish House of Bourbon, a sub- branch of the House of Bourbon, itself originally a branch of the House of France, and thus of the House of Capet and of the Robertians and possibly a branch of the Merovingians, but this link may not be reliable. The line can be traced back more than 1,600 years and is one of the oldest in Europe.

With 64 people killed and some 230 seriously injured, it was the deadliest train accident in German history until the collision of two D-Trains in the Genthin rail disaster on 21 December 1939, which claimed 278 casualties. The Accident The accident site A drawing by a witness of the accident site and rescuers heading for the site The accident occurred on a railway line between Freiburg and Breisach that had been opened on 14 September 1871. The line had been lengthened across the river Rhine to Colmar in 1878. On 3 September, which was the Sunday after the \\"Day of Sedan\\", more than 2,000 people from Alsace (which belonged to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War) had come to Freiburg to spend a relaxing holiday in the neighboring town. At 8 p.m., the train was scheduled to return to Colmar. During the evening, an intense storm and rain had occurred in Freiburg, and the water had probably undermined the rails at the Mooswald Forest, west of Freiburg. Due to the rain, the train's departure was delayed, and when it finally was underway it was carrying some 1,200 persons in 28 wagons. The driver was probably speeding somewhat to make up for the lost time and the train was traveling as fast as 70 km/h. When the driver noticed a washaway and tried to brake without the help of a brakeman, the momentum of the pushing railroad cars forced 25 wooden railroad cars to derail into swampy terrain. Only three cars remained on the tracks. The first witness was the driver of a train from Breisach. He brought help to the scene and went back to his train station. From the rubble of the devastated train, the helpers dug out 64 people who had been killed. Several entire families had been killed. About 230 persons survived the accident but with serious injuries, and five later died from their injuries. Horse-drawn and manually pulled carts brought helpers to the site and took the injured to the nearby villages Hugstetten, Hochdorf and Lehen, and in the morning, the last dead and injured were recovered. Because the telegraphic cable line had been damaged, the Freiburg fire department arrived first at midnight at the accident site. The question of guilt Memorial cross In April 1883, the chief inspector of the railways, an engineer, the train driver, a car guard and a station assistant were indicted before the Grand Criminal Court of the Freiburg Regional Court. As the exact circumstances and pace of the train couldn't be determined due to conflicting testimonies (the speed control was yet to be developed, and since all the defendants claimed their innocence, all of the accused were freed after five days of negotiations. Aftermath The disaster sent the German empire into a period of mourning: flags were flown at half- mast and public events were cancelled. The victims were transferred to their home communities in Alsace and buried there. Five corpses were laid to rest in Freiburg. Trains, such as the one involved here (a Type X c, named \\"Kniebis\\"), were afterwards given anonymous numbers, as to try to avoid the creation of \\"unlucky\\" trains. The locomotive involved in the accident was damaged only slightly and was repaired. Many passengers, however, refused to board the cars and adjacent lanes, and many landowners refused the locomotive to pass over their territory. In 1885, a simple memorial cross was built near the site of the disaster. References * Wolf Middendorf: Eisenbahnunglück im Mooswald, in: Freiburger Almanach 25 (1974), S. 51–56.

It served as the terminus of the Brevik Line from 16 October 1895 to the station closed on 1 December 1982. The station building is designed by Paul Due in Romansque style, is preserved and has been listed as a cultural heritage site. There was a major political discussion if the station should be located at Strømtangen or Setretangen. Construction commenced in 1893 and opened on 15 October 1895. The station initially saw heavy intercity traffic as it served the coastal ferries onwards to Agder until 1927. The main traffic was however a commuter train service to Porsgrunn and Skien, which operated until 1 February 1964. All passenger transport ceased on 26 May 1968. The station building was renovated in the late 1980s and is now used for office space. History Proposals for a railway to Brevik were first put forward in 1875,Sørensen (1995): 9 but not until 4 July 1891 did Parliament pass legislation to build the line.Sørensen (1995): 10 With national funding secured, the political debate moved to the location of the station in Brevik. Locations at Setretangen and Strømtangen were proposed.Sørensen (1995): 11 Setretangen would give a station closer to the village center, while Strømtangen would give access to docks which had less ice during winter.Sørensen (1995): 13 A public meeting was called in January 1892 by the proponents of the former to secure public support. As the public seemed to support Strømtangen, the organizers never let the issue come to a vote. The issue was then discussed in the municipal council's executive board, where four against one members supported the Strømtangen alternative. The location was finally decided by the municipal council on 25 June 1892, when sixteen against four aldermen voted in favor of Strømtangen,Sørensen (1995): 12 and subsequently approved by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB). Leveling of the plateau commenced in 1893, costing 32,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). One house was expropriated to make way for a road to the station and a smith was expropriated on the station area. The small valley of Bjørndalen was filled in and the remains of an old fort were destroyed during the work.Sørensen (1995): 14 A two-story station building was erected, and a new dock for steamships was built lower down, to allow a shortest possible correspondence time between the train and the ships. A spur was built down to the docks, allowing freight trains to level with the ships. Six buildings had to be expropriated in Torsvik.Sørensen (1995): 14 The official opening took place on 15 October 1895, officiated by King Oscar II.Sørensen (1995): 29 The opening of the station shifted the center of Brevik closer to Strømtangen. While this previously had been a less develop part of the village, several merchants, hotels and restaurants were established in the vicinity of the station.Sørensen (1995): 41 The railway established a section of housing in the Strømstangen and Trosvik area for its employees. The arrival of the railway resulted in a courier service in Brevik.Sørensen (1995): 42 Originally it was part of the station master's wages to hold the privilege to operate a restaurant in the station, which he did until 1922, when it was subcontracted. Its revenue peaked at NOK 25,000 annually in 1925, but then declined significantly after the Kragerø Line opened in 1927.Sørensen (1995): 54 In 1920 the station had thirteen employees, consisting of a station master, two secretaries, four telegraphists, five station workers and one courier. In addition there were employees related to other divisions, such as track and rolling stock maintenance, engineers and conductors. The line past the station was converted from narrow gauge to standard gauge in 1921,Sørensen (1995): 71 and was electrified on 19 June 1949.Norwegian National Rail Administration (2009): 34 The station received a face-lift in the 1930s, at which time the restaurant was moved from the southern to the northern wing. It was moved back after renovations in 1954,Sørensen (1995): 55 which also saw the main entrance moved to the road side and the offices and ticket booths renovated. Water closets were installed.Sørensen (1995): 66 To shorten the distance to the ferry quay, a pedestrian path was built in the 1950s.Sørensen (1995): 64 Following the 1962 opening of the Brevik Bridge the railway saw a sharp decline in patronage as the bus service was rerouted, capturing more of the traffic. Thus NSB decided to terminate the commuter trains to Skien from 1 February 1964. The express trains followed suit and since 26 May 1968 there has only been freight trains on the line. Brevik Station remained in use until 1 February 1982.Sørensen (1995): 71 With the termination of passenger traffic in 1968, the ground floor became disused. It rented to Trosvik Verkstad, which at first used it for office space. Later it converted the southern part into a physician's office. From 1982 the upper story was also available and rented to the same company, until it went bankrupt in 1986. A series of renovations were carried out, which partially destroyed many dignified aspects of the building. Following the bankruptcy, the station building was sold to Nydalen Compagnie. As they did not use it, the building occupied by homeless, who scavenged the building for molding and similar which was used for firewood, rapidly dilapidating the building. Brevik Management bought the building in 1988, fixed it up and moved their head office there from December 1988.Sørensen (1995): 69 Also the outhouse, which had been disused since the 1960s, was restored. The renovation work was awarded Sparebankens Brevikspris in 1991.Sørensen (1995): 70 The station building and two outhouses were listed as cultural heritage sites in 1997.Hartmann (1997): 149 Facilities Brevik Station is located at the southern end of the Brevik Line, from Oslo. All the stations on the Brevik Line were designed by Architect Paul Due,Hartmann (1997): 60 and Brevik Station was his third brick station building.Hartmann (1997): 69 It is designed with in a Medieval style and dominated by Romanesque motives. As was common for the era, the station was built with a corresponding park.Sørensen (1995): 65 The upper story of the station building was used as a residence for the station master. The station acted as the central transport hub for Brevik. The Strømtangen area also served, until 1934, as a quay for ferries along the coast, and until 1962 for car ferries across the sound to Stathelle. The bus route to Skien also terminated there. Narvesen established a kiosk at the station, but by the 1950s the traffic had fallen sufficiently that it had to close. There was also a privately run restaurant in the station building and it served as a hub for a courier service. Service The Brevik Line had one express train per day which ran to Oslo. Originally connected via the Vestfold Line, it ran via the Bratsberg Line from 1923.Sørensen (1995): 38 The bulk of the services on the line was a commuter train which ran to Porsgrunn and Skien. Until the end of the 1940s the station had between ten and twelve daily round trips, but during the 1950s this increased to as high as nineteen, often running at a fixed hourly headway, following the introduction of electric trains.Aspenberg (1994): 156 During the late 1940s and 1950s there was correspondence with a bus to Arendal at Brevik. Brevik was the furthest along the South Coast that the railway reached at the time it opened, and remained in that position until the opening of the Kragerø Line in 1927. In that period the station acted as a transfer station between the train and steamships for the fastest transport along the coast. The ferry service, Brevikruta, commenced in 1896, and continued until 1934, although it struggled for the last seven years. Plans for a railway ferry service to Continental Europe were launched in 1912. By 1915 Frederikshavn had been settled on and it was argued that it would provide fastest service from Norway to Hamburg, Germany. Two ferries would be required, each using seven hours on a crossing and allowing for two return services per day. However the plans were never carried through.Sørensen (1995): 53 References =Bibliography=  * Category:Railway stations in Porsgrunn Category:Railway stations on the Brevik Line Category:Railway stations opened in 1895 Category:Railway stations closed in 1982 Category:Disused railway stations in Norway Category:1895 establishments in Norway Category:1982 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Brevik Station"},{"id":"27101899","text":"Fernwärme is the fourth studio album by the German solo artist Michael Rother.

The album was reissued on CD in 1994 with bonus tracks and having been remastered. The artwork for the album was designed by Rike with photography by Ann Weitz. Recording and music Rother recorded Fernwärme augmented with Jaki Liebezeit from Can on drums. Aside from Liebezeit, the entirety of the album was written and performed by Rother utilising guitar and electronic instrumentation. The studio album was Rother's first without long-time collaborator Conny Plank, with whom he'd worked with on almost every project he had been involved in. The album was the final collaboration between Rother and the drummer Liebezeit. Liebezeit had played on each of Rother's first four solo albums. Rother predominantly utilised drum machines (already apparent on Fernwärme) on his subsequent studio albums. Releases Fernwärme was first released on Polydor Records as an LP and Cassette in 1982. In some English speaking territories, the album was retitled Silver Streak, which is the English translation of track one, \\"Silberstreif\\" and released in 1986. In 1993, Rother secured the rights to his back catalogue and re-issued all of his solo albums with bonus tracks and remastered sound on his own label, Random Records. Fernwärme was re-released under Rother's new arrangement the following year in 1994. In 2000, Rother re-issued all of the albums again in partnership between Random Records and BSC Music. Expanded editions include the 1994-era tracks \\"Silencio\\", \\"Underwasserwolken\\" and \\"The Doppelgänger\\". The album has since been released in the US on Water Records and as a heavyweight 180 gram LP on the 4 Men With Beards imprint.

It was released in 1998, after the dissolution of her contract with Polygram/Vertigo. Her new label WEA decided to publish the album only in Europe. Overview Love Me in Black is the first album released by Doro after her split from the PolyGram/Vertigo label, which had published all her works since 1985. Her new label WEA left her ample freedom for the making of her new album and she worked on it for more than two years, splitting its production in two teams. The first team was formed by the successful American producers and musicians Jimmy Harry and Fred Maher, the second team by former members of the German industrial rock band Die Krupps Jürgen Engler and Chris Lietz, who had already collaborated on Doro’s previous album Machine II Machine and on the following EP of remixes. The result of this double approach to production is surprisingly homogeneous, combining a heavier guitar sound than in the previous albums with plenty of electronic vibes, samples and a large use of drum machines and sequencers. The usual mix of ballads and hard rock songs featured in any Doro album takes on Love Me in Black an industrial and almost experimental spin, which also involves the vocals of the German singer, charged with many effects and distortions. WEA did not consider the album appropriate for the US market and published it only in Germany, much to Doro’s chagrin. The song \\"Love Me in Black\\" was released in EP format and remains a staple in Doro’s live show. The song \\"Barracuda\\" is a cover of the Heart’s hit single from their album Little Queen of 1977. The album peaked at position No. 38 on the German Longplay chart.

His career, cut short by pneumonia, mostly produced lyric poetry with cosmopolitan characteristics, distinct preferences for neologisms and archaisms, and willing treatment of kitsch as a poetic subject. These subjects were explored in various poetic forms, ranging from the conventionalism of formes fixes, some of which were by then obsolete, to the rebellious adoption of free verse. His poetry earned posthumous critical attention and was ultimately collected in a 1972 edition, but sparked debates among literary historians about the author's contextual importance. The son of dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale and the half-brother of writer Mateiu Caragiale, Luca also became the son-in-law of communist militant Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea. It was with Alexandru's brother, philosopher Ionel Gherea, that Luca wrote his work of collaborative fiction and sole novel. Titled Nevinovățiile viclene (\\"The Cunning Naïvetés\\"), it created controversy with its portrayal of adolescent love. Here and in his various modernist poems, Caragiale made a point of questioning established perceptions of love and romance. Biography =Childhood and adolescence= Born into the Caragiale theatrical and literary family, of Greek-Romanian heritage, Luca was, through his mother Alexandrina, a descendant of the middle class Burelly family. Lucian Nastasă, Genealogia între știință, mitologie și monomanie, at the Romanian Academy's George Bariț Institute of History, Cluj-Napoca Z. Ornea, \\"Receptarea dramaturgiei lui Caragiale\\" , in România Literară, Issue 31/2001 A famed beauty and a prominent socialite, Alexandrina was the model of visual artist Constantin Jiquidi (whose drawing of her in national costume became the first Romanian-issued postcard). Gabriel Dimisianu, \\"Revelațiile cartofiliei\\", in România Literară, Issue 22/2002 According to genealogical investigations conducted by Luca's father, she was also of Greek descent. Luca was Ion Luca Caragiale's second son, after Mateiu (later celebrated as the author of Craii de Curtea-Veche novel), who was born from the dramatist's extra-conjugal affair with Maria Constantinescu. Ioana Pârvulescu, \\"În numele fiului\\" , in România Literară, Issue 10/2001Cioculescu, pp. 356sqq According to researcher Ioana Pârvulescu, while Mateiu felt permanently uneasy about his illegitimacy, Luca was \\"without doubt\\" his father's favorite, and, unlike his older brother, \\"effortlessly knew how to make himself loved.\\" Alexandrina Burelly later gave birth to Luca's younger sister, Ecaterina, who, in her old age, was to provide a written account of the tense relationship between Caragiale's two families.Cioculescu, pp. 367–368 Luca's childhood and adolescence, coinciding with his father's itinerant projects, was spent abroad: while Luca was still a young child, he was taken by his family on a trip to France, Switzerland, Austria–Hungary and Italy, and they all eventually settled in the German Empire's capital city, Berlin (1905).Călinescu, pp. 494–495 Both he and Ecaterina were \\"almost confined to their home\\" by Ion Luca, who had a maniacal fear of disease and accidents.Vartic, p. 4 Around 1909, with his father's consent, Luca was being tutored in scientific subjects by poet-philosopher Panait Cerna, who was being hosted by the Caragiales in the German Empire while completing his studies.Călinescu, p. 651 In the end, literary historian Șerban Cioculescu argues, the young man acquired \\"a vast, albeit unschooled, culture\\", added to his native \\"ease of improvisation\\" and \\"outstanding memory\\".Cioculescu, p. 383 Ion Luca took a direct approach to his adolescent son's education, and the two often debated on cultural subjects,Călinescu, p. 495 or on Luca's left-wing opinions, such as his support for the Social Democratic Party of Germany.Barbu Cioculescu, \\"În exil\\" , in România Literară, Issue 4/2002 Ion Luca and his youngest son traveled intensely throughout Northern Germany, spending time on the Baltic coast, and once making their way into Denmark. Before Ion Luca's 1912 death in Berlin, they also returned on brief visits to their homeland, vacationing in the Prahova Valley resort of Sinaia.Cioculescu, p. 384 =War years= Alexandrina, Ecaterina and Luca Caragiale spent two more years in Berlin, living on a Romanian state pension; in mid 1914, sensing that world War I was about to start, the family moved back to Romania, and Luca was forced to give on his plans to attend a French college. The young poet made his debut in print during Romania's period of neutrality. On 14 May 1916, his Triptic madrigalesc (\\"A Madrigalesque Triptych\\") was published by the literary magazine Flacăra. The avant-garde aspect of such texts outraged the Neoclassical author Duiliu Zamfirescu, whose comments nevertheless assented that Luca did not lack poetic talent. From 1916 to the time of his death, Caragiale also worked on a distinct set of poems, probably inspired by a fond recollection of his stays in Sinaia: Dintr-un oraș de munte. Meditații (\\"From a Mountain Town. Meditations\\").Cioculescu, pp. 384–385 After his marriage to Fany Gherea (tentatively dated to 1919), Luca cemented the links between the Caragiale and the descendants of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the Marxist theorist who had been his father's close friend.Călinescu, p. 710 Fany was Constantin's granddaughter. Her father was journalist Alexandru \\"Sașa\\" Gherea (later a founding figure of the clandestine Romanian Communist Party), and her mother a native of Bavaria.Călinescu, p. 710; Vartic, p. 4 Luca and Constantin's other son, Ionel, were working together on Nevinovățiile viclene, a novel. It was first published in the 1910s by the Iași-based literary review Viața Românească, and immediately sparked controversy for describing the sexual desires of the educated youth. The accusations of pornography, Pârvulescu notes, placed Viața Românească editor Garabet Ibrăileanu in a \\"delicate situation\\", but also enlisted a public defense of the text, written by Ion Luca's friend and collaborator Paul Zarifopol (whose statements, she notes, were \\"spiritual and persuading\\"). This collaborative text was also the last work of fiction ever authored by Ionel Gherea, who subsequently focused almost exclusively on his contribution to local philosophical debates. Once Romania joined the Entente side and its southern areas fell to the Central Powers, Luca spent time in Bucharest, the German-occupied former capital. This period saw his controversial involvement with the collaborationist administration, drafted from among Conservative Party dissidents. Beginning in late 1916, Luca was chief of staff for Virgil Arion, the puppet Minister of Culture. The diaries kept by Conservative politico Alexandru Marghiloman, who was himself close to the collaborationist lobby, claim that Luca was well liked by the German overseers: invited to the Athénée Palace festivities in honor of military governor August von Mackensen (October 1917), Luca is said to have caught negative attention from the German-appointed Police chief Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, who wondered why the presence of such \\"nippers\\" was required.Boia, p. 203 Marghiloman also recorded an incident of December 1917, during which Luca, as Arion's chief of staff, humiliated Tzigara-Samurcaș when he requested a Police presence at one of his Culture Ministry functions directly from his German commanders.Boia, pp. 203–204 In June 1918, Luca took the controversial decision of publicly rallying himself with the Central Powers supporters in Romania: probably instigated by the more politically minded Mateiu, Luca signed his name to an open letter which called on Conservative Party leader Petre P. Carp to take hold of a hypothetical Germanophile cabinet.Cioculescu, p. 369. See also Boia, p. 204; Vartic, p. 4 =Late activity= During the early interwar period, Luca Caragiale remained settled in Romania, and frequented its literary circles. He authored memoirs of his father's life, published in January 1920 by Ideea Europeană journal. Titled Amintiri despre Caragiale (\\"Memories of Caragiale\\"), they notably include details about Ion Luca's deep dislike for lyric poetry, as well as accounts of his aging father's leftist flirtations (from the outrage he felt at learning about the authorities' violence in quelling the 1907 peasants' revolt to his friendship with socialist activist Christian Rakovsky).Cioculescu, pp. 28, 70, 120–121 The same year, he published with Viața Româneascăs sister company a translation of Knut Hamsun's novel Pan.Sanda Tomescu Baciu, \\"Knut Hamsun: The Artist and the Wanderer\\", in Philologica, Issue 2/2010, p. 28; Vartic, p. 4 His other translation work covered Edgar Allan Poe, as well as the poetry of François Villon—he was Romania's first Villon translator, seconded only in the 1930s by Horia Stamatu.Octav Șuluțiu, \\"Cronica literară: Zoe Verbiceanu, Baladele lui François Villon\\", in Gândirea, Issues 3–4/1941, p. 195 By 1921, Luca was working to publish his new poetry as a volume, which was to be titled Jocul oglinzilor (\\"The Game of Mirrors\\").Vartic, p. 5 In late March of that year, he was one of the noted witnesses at a Romanian Academy public readings, which included the licentious poem Răsturnica (roughly, \\"She-tumbler\\"; from a răsturna, \\"to tumble\\"), written, but unsigned, by the avant-garde poet Ion Barbu. Florin Oprescu, \\"Intrarea prin oglindă\\", in Tomis, February 2005 In May, he also appeared as a witness for the birth of Ecaterina's son, Vlad Geblescu-Caragiale.Vartic, pp. 4–5 These were some of his final records of his activities. Described as a man of \\"sickly\\" constitution by literary historian Tudorel Urian, Tudorel Urian, \\"Nenea Iancu & sons\\", in România Literară, Issue 32/2003 Caragiale fell ill with influenza shortly afterward, and quickly developed a form of pneumonia that caused his death in June. Zarifopol witnessed his \\"insane agony\\" experienced by his young friend, who \\"broke a bottle over his head, tore out clumps of his own hair\\" in an attempt to quell his pain. Caragiale was buried in the his family plot at Bellu cemetery.Vartic, p. 8 Fany Gherea remarried, taking as her husband Radu Lipatti, who was a relative of pianist Dinu Lipatti; she moved to Switzerland, where she continued to play host to her Caragiale inlaws.Vartic, pp. 6–7 Luca was also survived by his sister, who, after several failed marriages, became the wife of bureaucrat Petre Logadi in or around 1933. Both she and her husband were arrested by the Romanian communist authorities in 1951–1952; in 1955, Luca's exiled nephew, Vlad, became an editor for the anticommunist station Radio Free Europe.Vartic, pp. 5–8 Luca's mother Alexandrina died in 1954, and shares his grave at Bellu. Some interest in her son's work resurfaced in the following decades. In 1969, Nevinovățiile viclene was republished by the state-run publishing house for the youth, Editura Tineretului. His lifelong poetic contributions were collected as Jocul oglinzilor by literary historian Barbu Cioculescu, upon Ecaterina's request, and published Jocul oglinzilor (Editura Minerva, 1972). Ecaterina died in Bucharest in 1987. Her son Vlad, who was also a published novelist, died at Busset in 2006, by which time he was the last surviving of Ion Luca's descendants.Vartic, pp. 9–11 Work =Symbolist and Parnassian poetry= Luca and Mateiu Caragiale's stylistic affiliation with Symbolism illustrated a secondary stage in the development of Romania's own Symbolist current. This ideological choice, literary historian George Călinescu notes, pitied Luca against his father, a noted adversary of first-generation Symbolists such as Alexandru Macedonski: \\"[Caragiale senior] disliked the Symbolists and he anguished Luki so badly, that the latter broke out crying and declared his father to be without understanding for 'real poetry'.\\" Critics offer differing perspectives on Caragiale's overall contribution. According to Călinescu, his lyrical texts were generally \\"verbose and dry\\", while his other works lacked \\"the art of a prose writer.\\" Ioana Pârvulescu also opines that, while Mateiu, whom his father credited with the least talent, was able to impose himself in Romanian literature, Luca's \\"vaguely Symbolist\\" poetry only displayed \\"the involuntary expressiveness that one finds in any first attempts.\\" The verdict is common among other authors: Barbu Cioculescu and Ion Vartic mainly see young \\"Luki\\" as a mimetic and histrionic artist. Laura Pavel, \\"Gratia interpretandi\\" , in România Literară, Issue 4/2004 For Șerban Cioculescu, the overall nature of young Caragiale's contribution was outstanding: \\"Luca Ion was in fact a virtuoso who tried his hand on all instruments and keyboards with the same dexterity, in search of not just a poetic fixation, but in one's own fixation among the chaos of one's time. Beyond the mirages that his unquestionable talent puts on display for us, one catches a glimpse of a dramatic process of consciousness.\\"Cioculescu, p. 388 A large part of Caragiale's contribution to poetry comprises bucolic poems, which Călinescu acknowledges for their \\"vibrant\\" depiction of wild landscapes. The methods of writing, Șerban Cioculescu notes, are those of \\"Parnassian perfection\\", akin in rigor and professionalism to the Neoclassical tendencies of Caragiale- father: in this stance, Caragiale favored \\"obsolete species\\" of poetry, or formes fixes, such as the ballade, the rondel and the villanelle.Cioculescu, pp. 383–384 One poem, titled Ars poetica (Latin for \\"The Poetic Art\\"), is described by the same critic as evidence of Caragiale's Parnassian affiliation, and, although written in imperfect Romanian (verses in line with \\"cadence\\", but not \\"in agreement\\" with Romanian grammar), similar to the purist approach of the nominally Symbolist author Mihai Codreanu. He also notes that the implicit aestheticism of this credo creates a natural link between Luca and Mateiu, opposing them both to their more practical father. The poem reads: This series of poems offers insight into Luca Caragiale's lyrical perspective on nature. According to Cioculescu, Dintr-un oraș de munte and other nature-themed poems show that Luca had inherited his father's feelings of despair in front of bad weather, that they both found autumn rains to be unbearable.Cioculescu, pp. 384–385, 386–387 The depressive state in such poems is enhanced by Caragiale's preference for antithesis, and in particular by his understanding of the universe as oppressive, deceptive and stagnant—according to Cioculescu, his \\"Weltanschauung is dominated by a genius that, when not malignant, is in any case perfidious, treacherous.\\"Cioculescu, p. 386 To the bareness of autumnal landscapes, Caragiale the younger opposed a universe dominated by floral ornamentation. According to Cioculescu, the poems reference \\"more than forty species\\" of flowers, ranging from rose, carnation, jasmine or lily to the rarely sung corydalis (Romanian: brebenel), basil (busuioc), honeysuckle (caprifoi), chamomile (mușețel) or white dittany (frăsinel).Cioculescu, p. 385 Luca turned the flower species into symbols of emotional or meditative states, often placing them in a direct relationship with capital-letter references to poetic ideals (Autumn, Love, Pathos, Death, Hopelessness etc.).Cioculescu, pp. 385–386 One such allegory, present in the series titled Alte stanțe (\\"Other Stanzas\\"), associated lost love, mourning and the scent of jasmine flowers: =Avant-garde tendencies= The second category of poems are generally urban-themed, opting in favor of modernist means in both subjects and vocabulary. Discussing young Caragiale's conflict with Zamfirescu, Șerban Cioculescu concluded: \\"Luca may have seemed like an avant-garde poet, one of those who cultivated free verse and willingly simulated prosaic writing, into filming the everyday, with methods such as images caught from various angles.\\" He added: \\"The poet is a lucid one, a modern one, who [...] demystifies, demythifies and desacralizes poetry's old themes.\\"Cioculescu, p. 387 Caragiale's generic interest was in adapting to poetry the elements of \\"bad taste\\" in popular culture, of kitsch aesthetics and the banal. A special connection between Caragiale and experimental literature was his ambition of modifying the standard Romanian lexis, through the introduction of neologisms or the recovery of obscure archaisms. Șerban Cioculescu argued that, by adopting this \\"twinned regime\\", Caragiale prolonged his stylistic connection with Parnassianism into the realm of avant-garde poetry, but did so at the risk of confusing his readers. The neologisms, some of which were described as \\"very curious\\" by the critic, include words that did not settle into the common language, such as perpetrat (\\"perpetrated\\") and sfinctic (\\"sphinx-like\\"); among the archaic words employed are some words found in Romanian Orthodox Church vocabulary—blagoslovenie (\\"blessing\\"), pogribanie (\\"funeral\\")—and obsolete titles such as virhovnic (\\"leader\\"). According to the Cioculescu, Luca shared Mateiu's love for antiquated things, but was in effect \\"more complex\\" stylistically than his brother. The speech characteristics were doubled by a recourse to theatrical attitudes, leading Barbu Cioculescu to speak of a stylistic approach reconnecting Luca's work to those of his forefathers, and especially to Ion Luca Caragiale's \\"mimetic\\" approach to comedy writing. Among such works, critics have found memorable his Triptic madrigalesc, which, according to Călinescu, helped introduce to local literature \\"the cosmopolitan sensation, so cultivated by Western poetry (Valery Larbaud, Blaise Cendrars)\\". Dedicated to an unknown young woman, it opened with the lines: This prosaic preoccupation, Călinescu notes, led Caragiale to depict the dust-covered mahala quarters, the passage of loaded trucks, and the clamor of boarding school girls walking down boulevards. Various works in this series also display their author's sympathy for the urban underclass, showing the beggars' losing battle with the natural elements, or unloved old women reduced to envying the happy couples they meet on the street.Cioculescu, pp. 386–387 In more or less allusive poems, included by Cioculescu among the \\"desacralizing\\" texts, Caragiale also tests the limits of propriety, and questions the sexual taboos of his generation, from schoolgirls fantasizing about being kept women, to the moral severity imposed on churchgoers and the impact of sexual inhibition on the subconscious.Cioculescu, pp. 387, 388 The poet's sensibility for such themes touched not just his choice of subjects, but also his appreciation of other poems. In a 1922 letter to critic Tudor Vianu, Ion Barbu recalled that Caragiale's enthusiasm for Răsturnica, which can be read as a grotesque but compassionate homage to a dead prostitute, far exceeded his own: in Barbu's definition, Răsturnica was \\"that smut which wrung tears from Luchi Caragiale\\".Ioana Em. Petrescu, \\"Modernism as 'Radical Traditionalism' in Ion Barbu's and Constantin Brancusi's Artistic Views\\", in Keith Hitchins (ed.), Romanian Studies. Vol. V, 1980-1985, p. 155. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1986. =Other writings= With Nevinovățiile viclene, Pârvulescu argues, the young Caragiale produced a \\"more interesting\\" work than his poems, but the text's nature made it impossible to delimit \\"what part is owed to which author.\\" The debates surrounding are deemed \\"ridiculous\\" by Pârvulescu, who notes that the two protagonists, 15-year-old Radu and 13-year-old Sanda, only manage to steal each other \\"the first kisses.\\" The eroticism is present, but, according to the same commentator, is also \\"diffused, kept in check at the level of suggestions\\", and comparable to the style of later novels by Ionel Teodoreanu. The children's discovery of love during a summer vacation intersects itself, and contrasts with, episodes in the mature relationship between an uncle and aunt. The underlying meditation about one's loss of innocence is also rendered by the book's two mottos. One is a quote from Immanuel Kant, suggesting that innocence is \\"hard to keep and easy to lose\\"; the other a \\"Spanish proverb\\": \\"The devil sits to the right side of the Cross.\\" Among Caragiale's other texts were several prose manuscripts brought to critical attention primarily for their titles, as listed by Călinescu: Isvodul vrajei (\\"The Catalog of Bewitching\\"), Chipurile sulemenite (\\"The Painted Faces\\"), Balada căpitanului (\\"The Captain's Ballad\\"). A more unusual text left by the poet is a self- portrait in prose. The piece drew the attention of writer and art historian Pavel Chihaia for being \\"of a sincerity that one can only hope to meet in the present\\", and for contrasting Mateiu's own \\"conceited\\" autobiographical texts. Pavel Chihaia, \\"Printre cărți și manuscrise\\", in Observator Cultural, Issue 339, September 2006 The text moves from issues related to Luca's physical appearance (\\"lifeless\\" eyes, \\"unpleasant and stupid\\" hair) to self-admitted moral weakness (the joy of being confronted with other people's defects, the \\"cowardice\\" which prompts him to \\"say things I do not mean\\" etc.).

He is one of the most respected accordionists in the world and is widely considered the greatest accordionist by fellow lăutari. Life and career Ionică Minune (whose real name is Ene Gheorghe) was born in Costeşti, Buzău County, Romania into a family of lăutari. The members of his family played different instruments and they used to be booked together as one taraf (band) at various events in the village. At the age of four, Ionică took his older brother accordion and played a waltz by ear without any kind of training. Since then he continued to play and practice, mostly for his own pleasure, as he didn't want to become a professional musician. As a teenager, Ionică dreamed to become a policeman, but, when his father became ill, he started to play professionally in order to help his family. He quickly became one of the most famous accordionists and before he turned twenty he played only with masters of the lăutareasca music. Since 1979, he also started to tour abroad in countries such as: Italy, France, Spain, Germany, Japan and Malaysia. In the early 1990s he moved to France where he became one of the most appreciated accordionists. There, besides lăutareasca music, he started to play jazz, manouche jazz, as well as other kinds of music. Despite living a good life (he received French citizenship and an apartment) he didn't feel very comfortable in France and returned to Romania in 2006. There, he started an accordion school together with the accordionist Constantin \\"Fulgerică\\" and the cimbalom player Cristinel Turturică (a former member of Taraf de Haïdouks). Throughout his career, besides many great lăutari, Ionică Minune played with many worldwide known artists such as Bobby McFerrin, Oscar Peterson, Michel Petrucciani, Richard Galliano, Marcel Azzola, Didier Lockwood and Florin Niculescu. Trivia * He was nicknamed Ionică Minune (meaning Johnny the Wonder) by the great cimbalom player Toni Iordache. Adrian Minune took his own stage name in the honor of Ionică Minune. * Ionică Minune is known to have a passion for high class suits, shoes, belts, watches, perfumes, etc. While on a tour in Japan he bought over two tons of these. * While in France, he played for many famous people such as presidents François Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac, prime-minister Lionel Jospin and football player Zinedine Zidane. * When he was four years, dictator Nicolae Ceauşescu, who was on a visit to Costeşti, hold Ionică in his arms, as he was the smallest player in the local orchestra. * He a friend of Youri Djorkaeff.

This patent application states in part: \\"The activities which an infant carries out in the first months of its life plays an important role in the infant's acquisition of basic motor skills and in its ability to recognize differences in the shapes, colors and sizes of various objects, as well as differences between musical tones and other sounds. It is only by experience that the infant learns how to properly manipulate its arms and legs and to understand the nature of what it sees and hears. An infant whose activities in this crucial period are restricted, may suffer from an arrested development which may interfere with his future progress. In order to stimulate an infant into activities that will advance its development during the earliest period of its life, it is known to provide for this purpose an activity center designed to induce the infant occupying the center to turn around, to raise its head, to move its arm and leg appendages and to engage in other beneficial activities.\\" The Tiny Love team includes psychologists, child development experts, quality assurance specialists, parent groups and babies themselves. These contributors participate at every stage of product development. Toys are developed beginning with the premise that \\"babies are intelligent, creative, and unbiased human beings with spontaneous and individual reactions.\\"Tiny Love website, \\"Product Development\\", accessed April 25, 2010. Research for new toy development includes: *An understanding of babies' unique perspective on the world *Long-term observation of babies in play situations *Studies and observations of babies' responses to various stimuli and environments *Professional knowledge of psychological and physiological theories on infancy *Parent focus groups *Analysis of market needs and trends Recall of wind chime toys On February 10, 2010, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Health Canada, in cooperation with the firm, initiated a voluntary recall of Tiny Love's wind chime toys, some of which are included in the company's popular \\"Gymini\\" product. The company had received five reports of babies pulling apart the wind chimes, exposing sharp metal rods. There was one report of a minor injury to a 24-month-old baby who punctured his cheek with the rods.U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, \\" Tiny Love Recalls Wind Chime Toys Due to Puncture and Laceration Hazards\\", press release, February 10, 2010 (accessed April 25, 2010).

At the time of its discontinuing being an active league, it was the largest known single-sport conference in the United States. The NECVA was a leading Division III men's volleyball conference, which comprised 43 universities and colleges stretching from New Hampshire to Virginia in its final season. The NECVA folded in 2011, after the NCAA announced it would begin organizing a Division III national championship in 2012.  History  Founded in 1995 as the Metro Conference, it became known as the NECVA in 1998. Albertus Magnus College, Daniel Webster College, Emerson College and St. Joseph's College (Brooklyn) joined the conference for the 2009 campaign. Elmira College and Penn State Behrend joined the conference in the 2010–11 season as members of the newly formed United Volleyball Conference. Official website of Elmira College Athletics department The league was divided into five smaller divisions: CUNYAC (8), GNAC (7), Metro (10), New England (8), and Western (9) with one associate member. Each week, schools from the five divisions nominated athletes and then voted for the divisional Player and Rookie of the Week awards. The conference sports information office then selected the NECVA Player and Rookie honors from each of these five divisional winners. The NECVA held an annual 16-team conference tournament called the NECVA Championship Tournament each April with the top two schools in each division and six at- large selections earning berths. The NECVA champion received an automatic bid to the Molten Division III Men's Invitational Volleyball Championship Tournament in April.

He is best remembered as the final member of Bonnie and Clyde's gang. His role in the gang has often been misattributed to teenage gang member W.D. Jones as both men were portrayed as composite character \\"C.W. Moss\\" in the film Bonnie and Clyde (1967). Biography Henry Methvin was born in Louisiana on April 8, 1912, to Ivan \\"Ivy\\" T. Methvin and Avie Stephens. He was serving a 10-year prison sentence at the Eastham prison farm in Huntsville, Texas when Bonnie and Clyde came to break out Raymond Hamilton on January 16, 1934; one guard was killed and another wounded in the jailbreak. In the confusion, Methvin and three other inmates took the opportunity to escape with Hamilton.Yadon, Laurence J. 200 Texas Outlaws and Lawmen, 1835-1935. Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican Publishing Company, 2008. (pg. 180) Though Hamilton initially ordered them to go back, Clyde welcomed the convicts and offered to let them join the gang. Though the three men chose to take their chances alone, Methvin accepted Clyde's offer to stay. He remained with the gang until their end five months later.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 195-196) A month after the breakout, Methvin joined Hamilton and Barrow in stealing guns and ammunition from a National Guard armory in Ranger, Texas, under the cover of darkness on February 19. Eight days later, the men used the weapons to steal $4,138 from a bank in Lancaster. Bonnie and Clyde agreed to drive Methvin to visit his father near Gibsland, Louisiana, on March 1. Methvin was present when, the following month, the gang shot and killed Texas state troopers E.B. Wheeler and H.D. Murphy on April 1, 1934. Conflicting reports from relatives and alleged eyewitnesses have implicated each of the four gang members. Barrow himself was inconsistent on who he believed was the shooter. He wrote to relatives blaming Methvin, who he claimed had misunderstood Barrow’s suggestion that they \\"take\\" the troopers, meaning to disarm and take them for a \\"joyride\\", and instead opened fire. In a later letter to authorities, however, Barrow named Hamilton as the killer. Regardless of Methvin's role, he was part of another of the gang's murder five days later. On April 6, their car became stuck in mud near Commerce, Oklahoma. While trying to get the car moving, they were surprised by two local officers out on patrol and fired at them. Constable Cal Campbell was killed, and Police Chief Percy Boyd was wounded. Boyd was then taken hostage by the gang and later released at Mangle Corner, near Fort Scott, Kansas. The next day, while eating at a cafe in Stillwater, they abruptly left when a patrolman passed by. Methvin and the gang remained on the run for the next few months. On April 30, Methvin took part in a Kansas bank robbery with the Barrow gang, joined by Joe Palmer, and they escaped with $2,800. On May 1, the gang was identified in a bank robbery in Sac City, Iowa, and two days later they took $700 from a bank in Everly. They then traveled south to meet relatives in Dallas on May 6, and then another family meeting with Methvin's father in Louisiana. On May 19, Methvin was sent into a diner to get sandwiches for the gang. While he was still at the counter, a police car passed the diner, and Clyde drove off, leaving Methvin behind. He hitchhiked to Ruston, where his parents were living at the time. According to most versions of the story, Methvin told his father that the gang had planned a spot for a rendezvous in the event that any of the gang were separated. Methvin was supposed to meet the gang on a deserted stretch of highway south of Arcadia. Ivan Methvin, then being harassed by lawmen in pursuit of his son and the rest of the gang, was alleged to have given this information to Louisiana sheriff Henderson Jordan, who then passed it on to Texas Ranger Frank Hamer. In exchange, Methvin was promised that his son would not get the death penalty for the murders of Troopers Wheeler and Murphy in Grapevine, Texas two months earlier. It is unclear whether Henry Methvin was aware of this arrangement. On May 23, 1934, Ivan Methvin parked his truck near the meeting spot and removed one of the wheels as if changing a flat tire. When Bonnie and Clyde stopped to assist Methvin, Hamer gave the signal and his 6-man posse fired, killing both of them. An alternate scenario in the 1990s, supposedly suppressed for over 60 years, claimed that Ivan Methvin had been forced to go along with the ambush. He was stopped by lawmen on the highway and tied to a tree while his truck was disabled in order to lure Bonnie and Clyde. Although Henry Methvin avoided the Grapevine murders, his arrangement did not preclude prosecution for the Oklahoma murder of Constable Campbell. While he was locked up in the county jail, he and another fellow prisoner tried to escape by overpowering the jailer. The plan was they would rush the jailer and the other person would stab the jailer to death with a large pocket knife they earlier concealed in their cell. The jailer, a Seneca Cayuga Native American man by the name of Tom Armstrong overpowered Methvin and the escape was foiled. Another inmate helped the jailer by securing the other prisoner until Armstrong was able to detain Methvin. Methvin spent the rest of his time in the hole until he stood trial and was found guilty of the officer's murder and sentenced to death on December 20, 1935. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment on September 18, 1936, and he was paroled on March 20, 1942. Methvin continued to remain in trouble with the law. In November 1945, he was jailed for fighting and carrying a shotgun. He was arrested again for attempted robbery and drunk driving near Shreveport, Louisiana eleven months later. On April 19, 1948, Methvin was intoxicated while attempting to cross a railroad track and was killed by an oncoming train. Although it has been speculated that his death was retribution for the deaths of Bonnie and Clyde, especially after the similar death of his father Ivan 16 months earlier, no evidence of foul play has ever been produced. In modern popular culture =Television= Garrett Kruithof portrayed Henry Methvin in the 2013 mini-series Bonnie & Clyde, which aired on Lifetime, the History Channel and A&E; on December 8 and 9, 2013. Jake Dashnaw portrayed Methvin in the 2019 Netflix film The Highwaymen. Additionally, W. Earl Brown portrayed his father, Ivan Methvin in the movie.

The city of Baie-Comeau, Quebec, is named after him, as well as this city's history museum building. He was born in Les Îlets-Jérémie (located in the municipality of Colombier), not far from Betsiamites on the North Shore of the Saint Lawrence River. He was the eldest of eleven children. His father, Antoine-Alexandre Comeau, was an employee of the Hudson's Bay Company. His mother, Mary Luce Hall-Bedard, was of Irish origin. Napoleon-Alexandre Comeau spent his childhood in the woods in Labrador, at North-West River and the Mingan Islands, along with the Innu and Inuit, who taught him to hunt, fish and navigate. As a teenager, he spoke fluent French, Montagnais, Naskapi and Inuktitut. In 1859 he was sent to an English school in Trois-Rivières, where he learned to read, write and speak English.  Life and career  In 1860, Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau joined his father in Trinity Bay. His father appointed him, at fourteen, \\"guardian of the Godbout River\\". This, one of the 116 salmon rivers in Quebec, is a fishing area, and was then the private property of William Agar Adamson. Comeau retained this position throughout his life. He completed his training through the library. With Ashini Montagnais hunters, he learns the hatch and deepens his knowledge of the fauna and flora. He worked for 15 years as a trapper. He married Marie Antoinette Labrie on June 14, 1871. In 1877 he was appointed postmaster at Godbout. He became the assistant coroner (even practicing medicine, he attended the births of more than 250 newborns), before becoming, in 1879, Superintendent of Fisheries for the Canadian government. In 1883, he became a telegraph operator in Godbout. In January 1886, following the rescue of his wife's brothers, Alfred and Francois Labrie on the Saint Lawrence River, during which he traveled 60 km on the ice, he and his brother Isaiah were decorated by the Canadian government. In 1888, his wife Antoinette died of cancer. Comeau, who had no children from his first marriage, remarried in 1889, marrying his wife's sister, Victoria Labrie, who gave him 12 children. He was invited by Dr. Stevenson and Dr. Ahearn to stay at the Jeffrey Hale Hospital in Quebec City, to his knowledge. Napoléon-Alexandre Comeau died on November 17, 1923, in Godbout, where a monument was dedicated to his memory in 1927, with the text: \\"Humble child of the North, he learned to read with authority in the great book of nature while serving his people and his country.\\" There is a copy of this monument in Charlesbourg. His house is called \\"Castle Comeau\\". In 1998, Canada Post issued a stamp to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth. Naturalist From 1882, Napoleon-Alexandre Comeau developed a friendship with naturalists Elliott Coues and Hart Merriam, of the Smithsonian Institution. Comeau gave them a list of birds beyond North Shore, which was published in the Bulletin of the Madison Nutall Ornithology Club in 1882, and in the journal The Auk, in July 1884 and provided them with bird specimens. He also took many photographs, most of which have been lost. That same year 1882, he became a member of the American Ornithological Union in New York before going to hunt buffalo in Wyoming with Baron Ernest de la Grange. On March 6, 1883, he delivered a lecture before the Geographical Society of Quebec, entitled \\"The physical geography of the northern part of the province of Quebec.\\" The same year he collaborated with the prestigious American magazine Forest and Stream. In 1914, he collaborated on a study by the Canadian government on fisheries in the Arctic and the tourism potential of the Hudson Bay. Five years later he helped found the Provancher Society of Natural History.

Adrian moved from Canada to Vienna, Austria in 1972 where he became known for creating experimental artworks using radio and communications technologies. His work The World in 24 Hours, which connected artists in different cities and continents through telephone lines and radio, is considered to be one of the first experiments in online culture. Adrian is considered to be a pioneer in the field of telecommunications art and media art. Life Adrian was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on February 22, 1935. He moved to Vienna in 1972. Work Adrian was an early user of telecommunications and electronics technologies for artistic purposes. One of his earliest telecommunications projects, in collaboration with Bill Bartlett, was a work that used the business computer network of the company I. P. Sharp Associates, which Adrian had learned about and gained access to through fellow artist Norman White. Called Interplay, the piece was a telecommunications event that linked a dozen cities in Canada, the US, Australia, Austria and Japan on April 1, 1979. Following Interplay, Bartlett and Adrian organized and implemented of one of the first electronic mail systems for artists in 1979/1980. This again used the I. P. Sharp Associates computer network, this time from its Vienna office. Adrian was instrumental in setting up the system ARTBOX (later renamed to ARTEX) in 1979 for mail and media artists to use to communicate between each other. In 1982, Adrian organized Die Welt in 24 Stunden (The World in 24 Hours), a telecommunications work that used telephone lines and slow-scan television to link sixteen cities on three continents together. The piece is widely cited as an early example of networked electronic art and online culture. It was commissioned by and presented at Ars Electronica Linz.

History Records show that there has been an inn on the site since the mid-17th century. The current red- brick building, however, is undated. The pub was the location for Courts leet and baron on behalf of Bucklebury manor, and was often part of the Chapel Row Fair. In 1790, the sons of George III attended a prize fight there between \\"Hooper\\", one of Lord Barrymore's men, and \\"Big Ben Brain\\". The bout lasted almost three-and-a-half hours and 180 rounds, and was eventually called a draw. =Name= The name comes from the blade bone of a mammoth that was killed by prehistoric hunters. The skeletal remains of the animal were found preserved in the silt of the Kennet Valley; the name \\"Bladebone\\" was used to refer to the pub by 1666. The bone is encased in copper and hangs from the front of the pub as the pub sign. The copper casing is regularly repaired, and the bone within has been found to be preserved in an excellent state. Ownership In 1922, the pub was bought by Strange's Brewery of Aldermaston for £3,500(equivalent to approximately £150,000 in 2008). The brewery already rented the pub - along with a portion of the Bucklebury estate - for £86 (£3,500 in 2008) per annum. The pub was later owned by Whitbread.

He studied medicine and did research in pharmacology. The Meyer-Overton hypothesis on the mode of action on general anaesthetics is partially named after him. He also discovered the importance of glucuronic acid as a reaction partner for drugs, and the mode of action of tetanus toxin on the body. Life Meyer was born in Insterburg, East Prussia (now Chernyakhovsk, Russia). He studied medicine in Königsberg, Leipzig, Berlin and again in Königsberg. After his promotion to Doctor of medicine in Königsberg he worked with Oswald Schmiedeberg, one of the founders of pharmacology as an independent scientific discipline, in Strasbourg. In 1881 he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia). Also in 1881, he married Doris née Boehm. Together they had three sons, Kurt Heinrich (1883–1952), Arthur Woldemar (1885–1933) and Friedrich Horst (1889–1894). Between 1884 and 1904 Meyer occupied the Chair of Pharmacology in Marburg where he worked with Emil Adolf von Behring and Otto Loewi, winner of the 1936 Nobel prize in physiology or medicine. In 1904, Meyer moved to Vienna, and Loewi joined him until he was appointed to the Chair of Pharmacology in Graz. Ernst Peter Pick joined the department in 1911. Pick would later succeed Meyer as Chair. During Meyer's time in Vienna, he worked with three scientists who would eventually win the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. George Hoyt Whipple won the award in 1934, Corneille Heymans won in 1938 and Carl Ferdinand Cori captured the Nobel prize in 1947. Meyer retired in 1924 and remained in Vienna. Meyer's later life was impacted by National Socialism. His second son, Arthur was a well-known surgeon in Berlin who was one of the first to successfully carry out surgical embolectomy in massive pulmonary embolism. On November 14, 1933, Arthur shot his wife and then committed suicide. Arthur's wife was Jewish, and allegations were made that he was also Jewish. In 1938, Meyer and Pick were expelled from the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina as \\"non-Aryan\\". After this, Pick emigrated to the United States.

He supervised the doctoral thesis of Edmond Henri Fischer, who with Edwin Gerhard Krebs won the Nobel prize in physiology and medicine in 1992. Horst Meyer (physicist), the son of Meyer's second son Arthur, was adopted by Kurt after Arthur's death. He grew up in Geneva, where he studied Physics at the University and in 1959 joined the Physics faculty of Duke University, in Durham, NC, where he became Emeritus professor in 2005. Scientific achievements Hans Horst Meyer Medal awarded by the Vienna Academy of Sciences Meyer is best remembered for three discoveries.Klaus Starke: A history of Naunyn-Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology. In: Naunyn- Schmiedeberg’s Archives of Pharmacology 1998; 358:1–109 With Schmiedeberg, he discovered glucuronic acid as the most important reaction partner of drugs (in his case, a metabolite of camphor).O. Schmiedeberg und Hans Meyer: Ueber Stoffwechselprodukte nach Campherfütterung. In: Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie 1879; 3:422–450 He also discovered a relationship between the lipophilicity of general anaesthetics and their potency. Meyer concluded that lipophilicity was the essential factor in the effectiveness of an anaesthetic. These findings were summarized in three papers in Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie by Meyer and his coworker Fritz Baum, published in 1899.Fritz Baum: Zur Theorie der Alkoholnarkose. Zweite Mittheilung. Ein physikalisch-chemischer Beitrag zur Theorie der Narcotica.

This correlation became known as the Meyer-Overton hypothesis. It has been called the most influential correlation in anaesthesiaNicholas P. Franks: General anaesthesia: from molecular targets to neuronal pathways of sleep and arousal. In: Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2008; 9:370–386 Meyer also discovered that tetanus toxin acts on the central nervous system and is transported there from the periphery via the motor neurons. This explains why the incubation time always takes several hours, and why therapy with antibodies is of limited value.Hans Meyer und Fred. Ransom: Untersuchungen über den Tetanus. In: Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie 1903; 49:369–416 Meyer and Rudolf Gottlieb wrote a major German pharmacology textbook that was published in nine editions between 1910 and 1936. he also played an important role in the development and implementation of drug regulation in Austria. Awards Meyer received many awards and honors over the course of his career, at many different levels. One of the highest honors he received was the founding of the 'Hans Meyer Medal' on his 70th birthday by the Vienna Academy of Sciences. This medal was to be awarded every fifth year for the most important pharmacological contribution published in German. A volume of the Archiv für experimentelle Pathologie und Pharmakologie, edited by Bernhard Naunyn, was also dedicated to Meyer on his 70th birthday.

Cases of poisoning from tin metal, its oxides, and its salts are \\"almost unknown\\"; on the other hand, certain organotin compounds are almost as toxic as cyanide.G. G. Graf \\"Tin, Tin Alloys, and Tin Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim Biology and toxicology Tin has no known natural biological role in living organisms. It is not easily absorbed by animals and humans. The low toxicity is relevant to the widespread use of tin in dinnerware and canned food. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been reported after ingesting canned food containing 200 mg/kg of tin. This observation led, for example, the Food Standards Agency in the UK to propose upper limits of 200 mg/kg. A study showed that 99.5% of the controlled food cans contain tin in an amount below that level. However, un-lacquered tin cans with food of a low pH, such as fruits and pickled vegetables, can contain elevated concentrations of tin. The toxic effects of tin compounds is based on the interference with the iron and copper metabolism. For example, it affects heme and cytochrome P450, and decreases their effectiveness. Organotin compounds can be very toxic. \\"Tri-n-alkyltins\\" are phytotoxic and, depending on the organic groups, can be powerful bactericides and fungicides. Other triorganotins are used as miticides and acaricides. Tributyltin (TBT) was extensively used in marine antifouling paints, until discontinued for leisure craft due to concerns over longer-term marine toxicity in high-traffic areas such as marinas with large numbers of static boats.

Hexavalent chromium and its compounds are toxic when inhaled or ingested. Trivalent chromium is a trace mineral that is essential to human nutrition. There is a hypothetical risk of genotoxicity in humans if large amounts of trivalent chromium were somehow able to enter living cells, but normal metabolism and cell function prevent this. Forms of chromium Hexavalent chromium and trivalent chromium are chromium ions—they have different numbers of electrons and, therefore, different properties. Trivalent chromium, or chromium(III), is the form of chromium that is essential to human health. Hexavalent chromium, or chromium(VI), is an unequivocally toxic form. =Hexavalent chromium= Hexavalent chromium, also called chromium(VI), is hemotoxic, genotoxic, and carcinogenic. When hexavalent chromium enters the bloodstream, it damages blood cells by causing oxidation reactions. This oxidative damage can lead to hemolysis and, ultimately, kidney and liver failure. Patients might be treated with dialysis. The median lethal dose of hexavalent chromium is 50–150 mg/kg. The World Health Organization recommends a maximum allowable concentration of 0.05 milligrams per litre of chromium(VI) in drinking water. In Europe, the use of hexavalent chromium is regulated by the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive. Hexavalent chromium can be found in some dyes and paints, as well as in some leather tanning products. Primer paint containing hexavalent chromium is widely used in aerospace and automobile refinishing applications. Metal workers (such as welders)—as well as people with a surgical implant made from cobalt-chromium alloy—may also be exposed to hexavalent chromium. Chromium concentrations in whole blood, plasma, serum, or urine may be measured to monitor for safety in exposed workers, to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims, or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage. In the U.S. state of California, an epidemic of hexavalent chromium exposure led to a class- action lawsuit in 1993: Anderson, et al. v. Pacific Gas and Electric. The Pacific Gas and Electric Company had dumped more than 1.4 billion litres (370 million gallons) of wastewater tainted with hexavalent chromium into the Mojave Desert. This contaminated the groundwater, and caused widespread illness among the people of Hinkley, California, a small community nearby. As of May 2017, the mandated environmental remediation measures are ongoing. Chromate Chromates (chromium salts) formed from hexavalent chromium are used to manufacture leather products, paints, cement, mortar, anti- corrosives, and other things. They are carcinogenic and allergenic. The carcinogenity of chromate dust has been documented since the late 19th century, when workers in a chromate dye company were found to exhibit high incidence of cancer. Chromate enters cells by means of the same transport mechanism that carries sulfate and phosphate ions into cells. Contact with products containing chromates can lead to allergic contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis, resulting in ulceration of the skin—a condition sometimes called chrome ulcers. Workers that have been exposed to strong chromate solutions in electroplating, tanning, and chrome-producing manufacturers may also develop chrome ulcers. Genotoxicity Hexavalent chromium is genotoxic: it damages genetic information in living cells, which results in DNA mutations, and possibly the formation of cancerous tumors. One hypothesis asserts that the genotoxicity is caused by free radicals such as hydroxyl radicals, produced by the reduction of chromium(VI) to chromium(III). Another proposed mechanism supposes that chromium binds to DNA at the end of the reduction to chromium(III). A third hypothesis proposes that two other forms of chromium—Chromium(IV) compounds, along with chromium(V) produced by redox reactions in the cell—bind to DNA. =Trivalent chromium= Trivalent chromium, or chromium(III), is an essential trace mineral in the human diet. In some nutritional supplements, chromium(III) occurs as chromium(III) picolinate (in which chromium is bound to picolinic acid) or chromium(III) nicotinate (in which chromium is bound to nicotinic acid). Nicotinic acid is also known as the B vitamin niacin. Chromium(III) is poorly absorbed in humans; most dietary chromium is excreted in the urine. The threshold for acute oral toxicity is 1900–3300 mg/kg. In rats, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and indometacin can increase chromium absorption. Ordinarily, cellular transport mechanisms in humans and some other animals limit the amount of chromium(III) that enters a cell. Hypothetically, if an excessive amount was able to enter a cell, free radical damage to DNA might result.

Sunday services are held in the church, with the hymns and invocation invoked in the Hawaiian language. Inception Upon arrival to the islands, American Missionaries usually held religious services out in the open; this was later superseded by the building of thatched grassed hales, and then lumber built structures, sometimes imported from New England. The utilization of local materials became more prevalent over time Ecenbarger, pg 5 - 9 In 1832, Queen Ka'ahumanu, an early convert into Christianity, visited Maui, and came to the site of the then new Ka'ahumanu Church, witnessing services being presided by Jonathan Smith Green. Upon seeing this, Queen Ka'ahumanu asked the Congregationalist mission to name the permanent church structure after her.Ecenbarger, pg 18Engebretson pg. 67Ferracane pg. 92Kepler pg. 1Pruitt pg. 70Speakman Jr. pg. 65 First, second, and third Buildings The first building used by Jonathan Smith Green for his services was nothing more than a simple shed; it was built on land owned by Kahale family granted under King Kamehameha III. In 1834, due to the ballooning congregation numbers (3000 worshipers was noted at one point) a second building was built, which was a thatched structure.Engebretson pg. 66 However, despite the large worship numbers, the actual permanent membership of the church was small; an 1834-1835 report noted eleven members of the church.

During the \\"Great Revival\\" between 1837–1840, the church membership ballooned to 487; the 1838-1839 year alone saw 200 new members into the church.

William Patterson Alexander was installed at the church in 1857 after pastor Daniel Conde was not liked by the congregation and a petition to have him removed was circulated. Alexander noted that a new church was needed, and advocated building a new one as early as 1866. It wasn't until 1872 that fund-raising efforts were undertaken by William Pulepule Kahale, the first Native Hawaiian Pastor in the church, to build a new structure. Current building The current structure, the fourth on the site, was built in 1876. It was built to honor Queen Ka'ahumanu's earlier request by Wailuku Sugar Company manager Edward Bailey. It is built in the New England simple style Gothic Architecture. The bell and three clock faces are from the Seth-Thomas clock works,Pohaku pg. 90 and brought over in 1884 around the Cape Horn.

It was the last work Michelangelo created while under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, who died shortly after its completion. Inspired by a classical relief created by Bertoldo di Giovanni, the marble sculpture depicts the mythic battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs. A popular subject of art in ancient Greece, the story was suggested to Michelangelo by the classical scholar and poet Poliziano. The sculpture is exhibited in the Casa Buonarroti in Florence, Italy. Battle of the Centaurs was a remarkable sculpture in several ways, presaging Michelangelo's future sculptural direction. Michelangelo had departed from the then current practices of working on a discrete plane to work multidimensionally. It was also the first sculpture Michelangelo created without the use of a bow drill and the first sculpture to reach such a state of completion with the marks of the subbia chisel left to stand as a final surface. Whether intentionally left unfinished or not, the work is significant in the tradition of \\"non finito\\" sculpting technique for that reason. Michelangelo regarded it as the best of his early works, and a visual reminder of why he should have focused his efforts on sculpture. Background Battle of the Nudes (c. 1470) Antonio del Pollaiolo Michelangelo, at 17, was working under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici when he crafted the Battle of the Centaurs, although the work was not commissioned but created for himself. The work reflected a then- current fashion for reproducing ancient themes. Specifically, Michelangelo was inspired by a relief that had been produced for de' Medici by Bertoldo di Giovanni, a work in bronze that hung in the Medici palace. Michelangelo chose to work in marble rather than the more expensive bronze to keep down costs. Bertoldo's work, The Equestrian Battle in the Ancient Manner—also known as Battle (with Hercules)—was a recreation of a damaged Roman battle sarcophagus and required liberal imagination to fill in the gaps left by the damaged original. Bertoldo took other liberties with his source material and seems to have himself been inspired by the Antonio del Pollaiolo engraving Battle of the Nudes. The young sculptor never finished the work. While a number of biographies have attributed this to the loss of power of the Medici family, contemporary Michelangelo biographer Eric Scigliano argues that Michelangelo had plenty of time to finish the sculpture if he had chosen to and points out that this was only the first of several \\"non finito\\" sculptures, preceding the Taddei Tondo and Pitti Tondo. He also notes that Michelangelo expressed no dissatisfaction with the work. Whether or not the sculpture was intentionally left incomplete, Michelangelo regarded this sculpture as the best of his early works. He kept it for the rest of his life, though he destroyed or abandoned many of his other pieces. He remarked to his biographer Ascanio Condivi that looking at it made him regret the time he had spent in pursuits other than sculpture.Scigliano (2005), 44. Subject and theme According to Condivi, the poet Poliziano suggested the specific subject to Michelangelo, and recounted the story to him. The battle depicted takes place between the Lapiths and the Centaurs at the wedding feast of Pirithous. Pirithous, king of the Lapith, had long clashed with the neighboring Centaurs. To mark his good intentions Pirithous invited the Centaurs to his wedding to Hippodamia, whose name (\\"Hippo,\\" Ιππο, literally translates as \\"horse\\"), and may suggest some connection to them.Scigliano (2005), 43. Some of the Centaurs, over-imbibed at the event, and when the bride was presented to greet the guests, she so aroused the intoxicated centaur Eurytion that he leapt up and attempted to carry her away. This led not only to an immediate clash, but to a year-long war, before the defeated Centaurs were expelled from Thessaly to the northwest. The myth was a popular subject for Greek sculpture and painting. The Greek sculptors of the school of Pheidias perceived the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs as symbolic of the great conflict between order and chaos and, more specifically, between the civilized Greeks and Persian \\"barbarians\\". Battles between Lapiths and Centaurs were depicted in the sculptured friezes on the Parthenon and on Zeus' temple at Olympia. Scigliano suggests that Michelangelo's Battle of the Centaurs also reflects the themes of \\"Greeks over barbarians\\" and \\"civilization over savagery\\", but in Michelangelo's work he sees, in addition. the triumph of \\"stone over flesh\\". He notes that in the work itself, Michelangelo depicts his combatants using rocks against one another, and suggests that the sculptor could not have missed the coincidence that the name of the human fighters—Lapith—reflects the Latin word for stone (lapis) and the Italian word for stone plaque (lapide). Composition and technique Battle of the Centaurs, detail. The fluidity of the twisting figure's limbs is a departure from earlier Italian Renaissance careful articulation. The relief consists of a mass of nude figures, writhing in combat, placed underneath a roughed out strip in which the artist's chisel marks remain visible. Architectural historian Howard Hibbard says that Michelangelo has obscured the centaurs, as most of the figures are represented from the waist up.Hibbard (1984), 24. One of the few identifiable centaurs is visible in the bottom center, his leg extending between the legs of the twisting figure above him. According to Hibbard, Michelangelo has also obscured a lone female figure in the piece, while Hippodamia can be seen among the figures in the center right. Battle of the Centaurs was an early turning point and a harbinger of Michelangelo's future, sculptural technique. Michelangelo biographers, Antonio Forcellino and Allan Cameron, say that Michelangelo's relief, while created in a classical tradition, departed significantly from the techniques established by masters such as Lorenzo Ghiberti and Donatello.Forcellino and Cameron (2009), 32. Rather than working on discrete, parallel planes as his predecessors had done, Michelangelo carved his figures dynamically, within \\"infinite\\" planes. Forcellino and Cameron describe this break with modern practice as Michelangelo's \\"own personal revolution\\", and they point specifically to the left of the relief where a twisting figure becomes \\"something of an artistic manifesto.\\"Forcellino and Cameron (2009), 32-33. Particularly striking is the composition of the figure's upper limbs, which deviate from the carefully articulated norms. Also remarkable, according to them, is the manner in which Michelangelo sculpted independently of his preparatory drawings, freeing him from the constraints of two-dimensional vision and allowing him to merge the figures fluidly and multi-dimensionally. Battle of the Centaurs was also the first sculpture for which Michelangelo eschewed the use of the bow drill. Finer details of the relief were probably achieved with the use of a toothed chisel called a gradina. The smooth figures of the foreground contrast strongly with the roughly-hewn background, created with a subbia chisel. A traditional sculptor's tool, the subbia produced punched marks that had never before been left as a final surface in a work completed to this degree. Georgia Illetschko insisted in 2004, these unfinished surfaces are \\"a conscious compositional element.\\", and not due to a lack of time. According to Scigliano, it was an important development in the non finito sculpting technique.

The lake is contained with a nature reserve and it is located about south-east of Perth, in the Shire of Narrogin, and east of the town of Narrogin, in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. The lake is listed by the Australian Government as a threatened ecological community under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Description The lake lies in the catchment of the upper Blackwood River at an altitude of above mean sea level. It is about in area and in diameter, has a maximum depth of , and is one of the last remaining inland freshwater lakes found in south-western Australia. It is one of a chain of wetlands occupying a palaeodrainage valley forming part of the northern Arthur River system. Most of it is covered with a woodland of water tolerant tree species, with a large open area on the eastern side. Many other Wheatbelt wetlands formerly supported a vegetation community and ecosystem similar to that of Toolibin, but clearing for agriculture has resulted in most such sites becoming saline with a concomitant loss of emergent vegetation. Toolibin is the only major lake in the catchment that has not become completely saline. Toolibin Lake lies in a low rainfall area of the Wheatbelt with an average annual rainfall of 400 mm, mainly falling in May–August, with annual evaporation of 1800 mm. It usually only holds water at certain times of year; sometimes drying out completely for several years; sometimes holding water for extended periods. =Ramsar site= Toolibin Lake is recognised as a wetland of international importance under the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, under which it was designated Ramsar Site 483 on 7 June 1990. The Ramsar site includes the entire area of the lake with some adjacent land on the northern, western and southern sides of the lake added in 2001 since the original site nomination, ensuring a buffer zone of at least 100 m width around most of the lake. Flora and fauna Freckled duck Red-tailed phascogale Toolibin is the only remaining example in Southwest Australia of a wetland with extensive living thickets of swamp sheoak and the paperbark Melaleuca strobophylla on the lake fringes and bed - one of the main wetland types in the region prior to agricultural development there. Flooded gum, acorn banksia and rock sheoak woodland occur on the higher ground and deep sands surrounding the lake. The vegetation includes submerged aquatic plants and sedges around the lake. The vegetation community provides habitat, now rare in the central wheatbelt, for woodland birds and other animals. Toolibin and its environs support more breeding waterbird species — up to 25, including the rare freckled duck, cormorants, egrets, night herons and spoonbills — than any other inland wetland in south-western Australia. It also supports a population of the threatened red-tailed phascogale. Conservation The main threats to Toolibin’s ecological community are salinisation and waterlogging due to clearing of the catchment for dry-land agriculture, particularly wool and cereal grain production; eutrophication caused by run-off containing agricultural fertilizers; invasive weeds changing the structure of the ecosystem and reducing natural vegetation available for food and shelter for animals; and grazing of regenerating seedlings by kangaroos, livestock and rabbits. Actions to recover the environmental values of the lake and its catchment include the reduction of recharge – including revegetation and the protection of remnant vegetation; changes in farming methods, such as contour farming and the use of perennial grasses for grazing; the management of surface water in the catchment to reduce waterlogging of farmland, to decrease the salinity of water entering the lake, and to decrease salt loading of the lake; and groundwater pumping to lower the water table beneath the lake.

The clash happened in Balballa near to the border with the Bahr al-Ghazal province. The identity of the other combatant is disputed with the SPLA claiming it to be the North Sudanese Sudan People's Armed Forces (SPAF) whilst the SPAF and tribal sources say that it was Rezeigat nomadic Arab tribesmen that were involved. A Rezeigat tribal leader has said that 58 tribesmen were killed in the clash and 85 were wounded. The governor of Bahr al-Ghazal has stated that both sides suffered casualties but no figures for SPLA losses are known. The attack came just before results of the April general election were due to be announced. North Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was expected to win the election, with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement retaining control over the semi-autonomous south of the country. Responsibility It is not known who instigated the attack. The SPLA claims that the attackers were uniformed members of the northern Sudan People's Armed Forces (SPAF) and used four landcruisers with mounted machine guns. The SPAF denies any involvement in this attack but stated that the SPLA had clashed with the Rezeigat nomadic Arab tribe, calling it a \\"clear violation\\" of the 2005 peace deal. A tribal spokesman confirmed to the Agence France Presse news agency that the Rezeigat had been involved in the clash with the SPLA whilst searching for new pastures for their cattle. The SPLA denied this stating that the Rezeigat were not equipped with landcruisers. The governor of nearby Bahr al-Ghazal province only confirmed a clash between the SPLA and \\"armed men\\" that caused casualties on both sides. The governor stated that he would meet with the Darfuri authorities to discuss the matter. Attack The attack occurred in Balballa, South Darfur and according to a tribal leader resulted in the deaths of at least 58 tribesmen and the wounding of 85 more. Reinforcements from both sides are reported to be heading to the area with SPLA forces said to be headed from Raja, Aweil and Wau. The Rezeigat were previously involved in a conflict with other nomadic tribes in 2009 that claimed the lives of 900 people. The SPLA is affiliated with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement which rules the semi-autonomous South Sudan region and was permitted to retain an army after a peace deal ended the Second Sudanese Civil War in 2005. The SPLA stated that another attack had been launched on its forces in the area on 25 April. This attack occurred in the Raja area and forced the SPLA force to retreat. Of the approximately 100 men in the area 47 had reported back with the remainder presumed to be still out in the field.

Named for James Wolcott, a businessman in the late 1820s to the mid 1840s, only the Wolcott House is original to the site. Built by James Wolcott and his wife, Mary Wells, the Wolcott House began as a log house and evolved into a 14-room Federal-style mansion between 1827 and 1836. The house is a blend of federal and classic architecture. In 1826, James Wolcott and his Mary moved to Maumee. They purchased 300 acres for $1.25 an acre in 1827 and began construction of their home. Wolcott built wharves and warehouses on the Maumee River and constructed two steamships to transport his merchandise. . James and Mary Wolcott had five sons and a daughter. The house passed through three generations to Wolcott's great-granddaughter, Rilla Hull, who was the last of the Wolcott line to reside in the \\"Mansion on the Maumee\\". Upon her death in 1957, Hull bequeathed her home for public use and benefit. St. Paul's Episcopal Church transferred the landmark to the City of Maumee for use as a historical museum.

He is known as a member and one of the founders of the Finnish metal band Amoral 1997–2017. In the beginning of 2018, he founded a new heavy metal band, Oceanhoarse. Musical career Ben Varon started playing guitar when he was 11–12 years old. He had been begging for an electric guitar for about a year, and finally got a Strat copy as a birthday present from his parents. The first few years went by without much progress: He did take a few lessons to get started, but did not really practice much at all. Varon tells in his bio, that it was only later when he understood, that if he wanted to go anywhere with his playing he should start to work on it. Varon is mostly self-taught, but he has taken some lessons over the years. First, when he got started to learn to tune the guitar and to form a power chord. Then, a few years later when he started actually to practice, he took lessons for a while at Pop & Jazz conservatory in Helsinki. Ben was taught also by the Finnish legend Roope Latvala around 2001 about scales and modes including some of Stone licks, in which he was very interested at that time. The biggest influence on Varon's music had been Slash, the guitarist of Guns N' Roses and Pantera's murdered guitarist Dimebag Darrell. Slash, with the pompous Use Your Illusion songs, blew Varon's mind up and was the reason for him to start to play guitar. A bit later on Varon got into Pantera, but Dime's playing affected him until now. Both the lead and rhythm work of Dime greatly inspired him. Some other sources of inspiration include Nuno Bettencourt, Roope Latvala, Randy Rhoads and Zakk Wylde. In 2012, Japanese Young Guitar Magazine published 10 pages of Amoral's notes with Varon demonstrating them. Varon was chosen at \\"Finnish Metal Awards\\" in 2009 6th, 2010 4th and 2011 5th best metal musician in Finland. Amoral 1997-2017 1997 at the age of 14 Varon started to play with Juhana Karlsson (drums), with whom he went to the same school. They started by jamming on a couple of Metallica songs. That was the first time Ben played together with another musician. They went jamming as often as possible. Silver Ots joined soon after. Amoral was founded 1997. Amoral played technical, progressive, melodic, hardrock oriented metal. The band's 4th album was an about-turn, replacing the dominance of quirky death metal with an exemplary display of riff-driven, heavy, yet melodic power groove and the occasional sing-along chorus. Amoral performed extensively in bars, clubs, festivals and other venues in Finland, Europe, Japan, China, Philippines and USA. The band split up in 2017 after 20 years together. Ben Varon has always been involved in the songwriting for Amoral's music. Whilst he contributed alongside Silver Ots on the first four albums, he took after the main responsibility of songwriting and was accompanied by the guitarist Masi Hukari on the fifth and sixth albums. The music and lyrics for Amoral's last album In Sequence Varon made mainly alone. In Amoral's first years Varon has contributed lyrics to a few songs for Amoral's music. After singer and main lyricists Niko Kalliojärvi's departure in 2008 Varon took over the main responsibility to write lyrics. Oceanhoarse 2018 - 2016, once Amoral's closing decision was made, Ben started with a new band from zero. After 2 years work with its music, in the beginning of 2018, the new heavy metal band Oceanhoarse was announced. Oceanhoarse has told they will not use any backgrounds or synthesizers in their upcoming music. The emphasis would be on live-oriented heavy metal. The other members beside Ben Varon are Tommy Tuovinen (MyGrain) in vocals, Jyri Helko (For The Imperium, Warmen) in bass and Oskari Niemi in drums. The debut single The Oceanhoarse was played first time on Radio Rock Jan 17 and the video was published Jan 18 2018. Alcyona Sky 2014- 2013, after ending Amoral's fifth album Fallen Leaves & Dead Sparrows, Varon went on composing the summer long material that didn't fit to Amoral's style, 90's rock and acoustic-driven sound of the 70's. 2014 he founded a new group Alcyona Sky to play this music. The other members beside guitarist Varon are Micko Hell (Denigrate, Million Dollar Beggars) in vocals, Rale Tiiainen (The Black League, The OHO, Ancara) in drums and Jyri Helko in bass. AS has released one album Alcyona Sky in April 2017. The band told after the album was released to leave it as a one-off project. The album can be listened on Spotify. Dimebag Beyond Forever, Grease Helmet, Tornado, Panorama From 2007, Varon played at Dimebag Beyond Forever tribute act. 2011 Varon performed at Tornado's album Amsterdamn, Hellsinki. Varon also plays in Andy McCoy's band Grease Helmet, which was created 2012. Grease Helmet released one album in 2012. 2017 Varon joined to a new musical project, to play guitar in Panorama. The first single of Panorama is Varon's handwrite.

He was a notorious conman and check forger in California during the early 20th century. Between 1913 and 1914, he passed out an estimated $40,000 in rubber checks and was also responsible for a series of train robberies against the Southern Pacific Railroad. It was partly due to his robberies that the railroad company first began arming its guards. Biography Born around 1879, little is known about Jean LaBanta's early life. In April 1911, he was convicted of grand larceny in San Benito County, California, and sentenced to 2 years imprisonment at San Quentin. He received an early parole in 1913 and was soon being investigated by authorities in several California counties for writing rubber checks. Placer County was the first to issue a warrant on LaBanta, then under his alias Clyde Kaufman, for forging $65 checks. Investigators would discover that LaBanta had passed out an estimated $40,000 in fraudulent checks.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 173-174) During this time, LaBanta also robbed several express trains belonging to the Southern Pacific Railroad. His first attempt occurred on October 14, 1913, when he donned a mask and boarded Southern Pacific Train No. 23 during a mail exchange at Burlingame. Reaching the express car, he put sacks on the heads of two guards at gunpoint and forced them to sit in a corner while the train continued on to San Francisco. LaBanta jumped off the train at some point, though the guards did not see him, and escaped with $100. Despite the small reward for a high-risk venture, LaBanta tried again a month later. On November 17, he snuck on board Southern Pacific Train No. 77 and again forced hoods on the clerks at gunpoint while he searched through the mail. After gathering another small score, he jumped off the train before pulling into Burlingame. As a result of the robberies, the Southern Pacific Railroad ordered that all express guards on the northern California runs would be armed. LaBanta moved to Los Angeles following Southern Pacific's announcement. He soon found an accomplice, Jean Dolly (aka \\"Jim Barry\\"), who had been recently paroled from San Quentin after serving 18 months for forgery. On January 10, 1914, the two men jumped on Southern Pacific Train No. 9, two minutes before its scheduled departure from Los Angeles at 10:15 am. They held up the mail car, unmasked this time, and stole $600 before jumping out shortly before the train's arrival in Burbank. The law eventually caught up to LaBanta and took him into custody at a San Francisco hotel on January 20, 1914. After a lengthy interrogation, LaBanta also confessed to the train robberies as well quietly bragging to investigators that he was the perpetrator of \\"much more classier crimes\\" than bouncing checks. Dolly was quickly arrested after being identified by mail clerks and was indicted with LaBanta by a federal grand jury on February 10. His accomplice pleaded guilty on March 6 and was sentenced to San Quintin for 5 years while LaBanta, who pleaded guilty the day after his indictment, was sentenced to 54 years. This was reduced to 25 when the judge made the sentences concurrent. LaBanta was paroled on September 24, 1926, and disappeared from public record thereafter. References Further reading *DeNevi, Don.

Chandler's single reached #12 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 10 Billboard R&B; hit, peaking at #8. It was also an RIAA Certified Million- Seller, the Gold Record being awarded in November 1970. It was Chandler's second-biggest chart hit single, his biggest being the million-selling #1, \\"Duke of Earl\\", in 1962. It was taken from his album, The Gene Chandler Situation. This version is noted for the instrumental quoting, by muted trumpets, of the song \\"A Tisket, A Tasket\\" heard during the Introduction as well as in the Coda section, before the repeated chorus takes place before the song's fade. The success of this, and other records he wrote, recorded and produced that year earned him The National Association of Television and Radio Announcers Producer of the Year Award in 1970, against other nominees that included Kenneth Gamble, Leon Huff and Norman Whitfield.

Methods used include roadside speed traps set up and operated by the police and automated roadside 'speed camera' systems, which may incorporate the use of an automatic number plate recognition system. Traditionally, police officers used stopwatches to measure the time taken for a vehicle to cover a known distance. More recently, radar guns and automated in-vehicle systems have come into use. A worldwide review of studies found that speed cameras led to a reduction of \\"11% to 44% for fatal and serious injury crashes\\". The UK Department for Transport estimated that cameras had led to a 22% reduction in personal injury collisions and 42% fewer people being killed or seriously injured at camera sites. The British Medical Journal recently reported that speed cameras were effective at reducing accidents and injuries in their vicinity and recommended wider deployment. An LSE study in 2017 found that \\"adding another 1,000 cameras to British roads could save up to 190 lives annually, reduce up to 1,130 collisions and mitigate 330 serious injuries.\\" History Traffic calming was built into the 1865 Locomotive Act in the UK, which set a speed limit of in towns and out of town, by requiring a man with a red flag to walk ahead of qualifying powered vehicles. The distance ahead of the pedestrian crew member was reduced to in 1878 and the vehicles were required to stop on the sight of a horse. The speed limit was effectively redundant as vehicle speeds could not exceed the speed at which a person could walk. By 1895 some drivers of early lightweight steam-powered autocars assumed that these would be legally classed as a horseless carriage and would therefore be exempt from the need for a preceding pedestrian. A test case was brought by motoring pioneer John Henry Knight, who was subsequently convicted of using a locomotive without a licence. The Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 lifted some of the restrictions introduced by the 1865 Act, notably raising the speed limit for \\"light locomotives\\" under 3 tonnes to . The speed limit was lifted again by the Motor Car Act 1903 to . A Royal Commission on motorcars in the UK reported in 1907 and raised concerns about the manner in which speed traps were being used to raise revenue in rural areas rather than being used to protect lives in towns. In parliamentary debates at the time it was observed that \\"Policemen are not stationed in the villages where there are people about who might be in danger, but are hidden in hedges or ditches by the side of the most open roads in the country\\" and were \\"manifestly absurd as a protection to the public, and they are used in many counties merely as a means of extracting money from the passing traveller in a way which reminds one of the highwaymen of the Middle Ages\\". In 1905 The Automobile Association was formed to help motorists avoid police speed traps. Chief Justice, Lord Alverston brought a test court case in 1910 ('Betts -v- Stevens') against an Automobile Association patrolman and a potentially speeding motorist—the judge ruled that where a patrolman signals to a speeding driver to slow down and thereby avoid a speed trap, that person would have committed the offence of \\"obstructing an officer in the course of his duty\\" under the Prevention of Crimes Amendment Act 1885.JA Coutts, 'Obstructing the Police' (1956) 19 MLR 411 Subsequently, the organisation developed a coded warning system which was used until the 1960s whereby a patrolman would always salute the driver of a passing car that displayed a visible AA badge unless there was a speed trap nearby, on the understanding that their officers could not be prosecuted for failing to salute.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/7141302/AA- ballots-on-first-strike-in-105-years.html Gatsometer BV, founded in 1958 by rally driver Maurice Gatsonides, produced the 'Gatsometer' which was described as \\"a revolutionary speed-measuring device\\". Developed initially for improving his race times, it was later marketed as police speed enforcement tool. Gatsometer claim to have developed the first radar for use with road traffic in 1971, but this claim is undermined by evidence that radar detectors were already for sale in 1967. Gatsometer BV produced the world's first mobile speed traffic camera in 1982. VASCAR was in use in North Carolina, New York and Indiana by February 1968. Methods Police officers in Bavaria checking speed with a tripod-mounted LIDAR speed gun. Speed limits were originally enforced by manually timing or \\"clocking\\" vehicles travelling through \\"speed traps\\" defined between two fixed landmarks along a roadway that were a known distance apart; the vehicle's average speed was then determined by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken to travel it. Setting up a speed trap that could provide legally satisfactory evidence was usually time-consuming and error-prone, as it relied on its human operators. =Average speed measurement= VASCAR is a device that semi-automates the timing and average speed calculation of the original manually operated \\"speed trap\\". An observer on the ground, in a vehicle or in the air simply presses a button as a vehicle passes two landmarks that are a known distance apart, typically several hundred metres. Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems that use a form of optical character recognition read the vehicle's licence or registration plate. A computer system reads vehicle registration plates at two or more fixed points along a road, usually hundreds of meters or even kilometers apart, then uses the known distance between them to calculate a vehicle's average speed. From the mean value theorem, we know that the vehicle's speed must equal its average speed at some time between the measurements. If the average speed exceeds the speed limit, then a penalty is automatically issued. Police in some countries like France have been known to prosecute drivers for speeding, using an average speed calculated from timestamps on toll road tickets. Speed enforcement using average speed measurement is expressly prohibited in California.CVC 40802 Speed Traps, CVC 40801 Speed Trap Prohibition =Instantaneous speed measurement= Automatic traffic speed measurement in Denmark Traffic Speed Interceptor - Vehicles with speed camera used by Bangalore Police, India Instantaneous speed cameras measure the speed at a single point. These may either be a semi-permanent fixture or be established on a temporary basis. A variety of technologies can be used: * Radar speed guns use a microwave signal that is directed at a vehicle; the Doppler effect is used to derive its speed. * LIDAR speed guns utilize the time of flight of laser pulses to make a series of timestamped measurements of a vehicle's distance from the laser; the data is then used to calculate the vehicle's speed. * Sensors embedded in the roadway in pairs, for example electromagnetic induction or Piezo-electric strips a set distance apart. * Infra-red light sensors located perpendicular to the road, e.g. TIRTL. =Pacing= Officers in some jurisdictions may also use pacing, particularly where a more convenient radar speed measuring device is not available—a police vehicle's speed is matched to that of a target vehicle, and the calibrated speedometer of the patrol car used to infer the other vehicle's speed. =Cameras= In recent years many jurisdictions began using cameras to record violators. These devices detect vehicles that are exceeding the speed limit and take photos of these vehicles' license plates. A ticket is then mailed out to the registered owner. =Other= Some jurisdictions such as Australia and Ohio, allow prosecutions based on a subjective speed assessment by a police officer. In the future there is the potential to track speed limit compliance via GPS black boxes for recidivist speeders identified in the Australian National Road Safety Strategy 2011 - 2020 section on Intelligent speed adaptation. Effectiveness =Speed cameras= *Aside from the issues of legality in some countries and states and of sometime opposition the effectiveness of speed cameras is very well documented. The introduction to The Effectiveness of Speed Cameras A review of evidence by Richard Allsop includes the following in the foreword by Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC (Royal Automobile Club). \\"While this report fully lays out the background to the introduction of speed cameras and the need for speed limits, its job is not to justify why the national limits are what they are; a review of speed limits to see whether they are soundly based is for another day. What it has done is to show that at camera sites, speeds have been reduced, and that as a result, collisions resulting in injuries have fallen. The government has said that a decision on whether speed cameras should be funded must be taken at a local level. With the current pressure on public funds, there will be – indeed there already are – those who say that what little money there is can be better spent. This report begs to differ. The devices are already there; they demonstrate value for money, yet are not significant revenue raisers for the Treasury; they are shown to save lives; and despite the headlines, most people accept the need for them. Speed cameras should never be the only weapon in the road safety armoury, but neither should they be absent from the battle.\\" *The 2010 Cochrane Review of speed cameras for the prevention of road traffic injuries and deaths reported that all 28 studies accepted by the authors found the effect of speed cameras to be a reduction in all crashes, injury crashes, and death or severe injury crashes. \\"Twenty eight studies measured the effect on crashes. All 28 studies found a lower number of crashes in the speed camera areas after implementation of the program. In the vicinity of camera sites, the reductions ranged from 8% to 49% for all crashes, with reductions for most studies in the 14% to 25% range. For injury crashes the decrease ranged between 8% to 50% and for crashes resulting in fatalities or serious injuries the reductions were in the range of 11% to 44%. Effects over wider areas showed reductions for all crashes ranging from 9% to 35%, with most studies reporting reductions in the 11% to 27% range. For crashes resulting in death or serious injury reductions ranged from 17% to 58%, with most studies reporting this result in the 30% to 40% reduction range. The studies of longer duration showed that these positive trends were either maintained or improved with time. Nevertheless, the authors conceded that the magnitude of the benefit from speed cameras \\"is currently not deducible\\" due to limitations in the methodological rigor of many of the 28 studies cited, and recommended that \\"more studies of a scientifically rigorous and homogenous nature are necessary, to provide the answer to the magnitude of effect.\\" *According to the 2003 NCHRP study on Red Light Running (RLR), \\"RLR automated enforcement can be an effective safety countermeasure....[I]t appears from the findings of several studies that, in general, RLR cameras can bring about a reduction in the more severe angle crashes with, at worst, a slight increase in less severe rear-end crashes. However it noted that \\"there is not enough empirical evidence based on proper experimental design procedures to state this conclusively.\\" * The 2010 report, \\"The Effectiveness of Speed Cameras A review of evidence\\", by Richard Allsop concludes \\"The findings of this review for the RAC Foundation, though reached independently, are essentially consistent with the Cochrane Review conclusions. They are also broadly consistent with the findings of a meta-analysis reported in the respected Handbook of Road Safety Measures, of 16 studies, not including the four-year evaluation report, of the effects of fixed cameras on numbers of collisions and casualties.\\" * A recent study conducted in Alabama reveals that Red Light Cameras (RLCs) seem to have a slight impact on the clearance lost time; the intersections equipped with RLCs are half a second less in use compared with those without cameras; and highway capacity manual estimates a shorter lost time and thus may overestimate the intersection's capacity. * In 2001 the Nottingham Safety Camera Pilot achieved \\"virtually complete compliance\\" on the major ring road into the city using average speed cameras, across all Nottinghamshire SPECS installations, KSI (Killed / Seriously Injured) figures have fallen by an average of 65%. * In 2003 Injury Prevention reported that speed cameras were effective at reducing accidents and injuries and recommended wider deployment. In February 2005 the British Medical Journal reported that speed cameras were an effective intervention in reducing road traffic collisions and related casualties, noting however that most studies to date did not have satisfactory control groups. In 2003 Northumbria Police's Acting Chief Inspector of motor patrols suggested that cameras didn't reduce casualties but did raise revenue – an official statement from the police force later re-iterated that speed cameras do reduce casualties. * In December 2005 the Department for Transport published a four-year report into Safety Camera Partnerships which concluded that there was a 22% reduction in personal injury collisions and 42% fewer people being killed or seriously injured following the installation of cameras. The Times reported that this research showed that the department had been previous exaggerating the safety benefits of speed cameras but that the results were still 'impressive'. * A report published by the RAC Foundation in 2010 estimated that an additional 800 more people a year could be killed or seriously injured on the UK's roads if all speed cameras were scrapped. A survey conducted by The Automobile Association in May 2010 indicated that speed cameras were supported by 75% of their members. * *The town of Swindon abandoned the use of fixed cameras in 2009, questioning their cost- effectiveness with the cameras being replaced by vehicle-activated warning signs and enforcement by police using mobile speed cameras: in the nine months following the switch-off there was a small reduction in accident rates which had changed slightly in similar periods before and after the switch off (Before: 1 fatal, 1 serious and 13 slight accidents. Afterwards: no fatalities, 2 serious and 12 slight accidents). The journalist George Monbiot claimed that the results were not statistically significant highlighting earlier findings across the whole of Wiltshire that there had been a 33% reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured generally and a 68% reduction at camera sites during the previous 3 years. In 2012, the town had the fewest accident rates per 1,000 registered vehicles: a result linked by the Local Authority Member for Council Transformation, Transport and Strategic Planning to the removal of speed cameras and resultant additional funding for road safety, alongside close working with the police. Evidence gathering UK fixed speed camera with road calibration markings While digital cameras can be used as the primary means of speed detection when combined with automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) average-speed camera systems, their use is more commonly restricted to evidence gathering where speeding offences are detected by various other types of sensors such as Doppler radar, piezo strips, infrared or laser devices. Photographs are typically time-stamped by a high resolution timing device so that a vehicle's speed can be checked manually after the fact if necessary using the secondary method of calculating its speed between a series of calibrated lines (known as \\"Dragon's Teeth\\") painted on the road surface. The change from analogue \\"wet film\\" to digital technology has revolutionised speed cameras, particularly their maintenance and the back-office processing required to issue penalty notices. Images from digital cameras can be uploaded in seconds to a remote office over a network link, while optical character recognition software can automate the \\"reading\\" of vehicle registration numbers. Types of camera include Gatso, Truvelo Combi and D-cam.  Avoidance and evasion  RADAR and LIDAR detector Some drivers use passive radar detectors or LIDAR detectors to detect police radar or LIDAR signals, with the intention of avoiding or evading prosecution by slowing down before entering an enforcement zone. The legal standing of these type of devices varies by jurisdiction. For example, they are legal in most of the United States, but not in most of Canada. Active devices might also be used—in this instance, radar or LIDAR signals are typically jammed with counter emissions. These devices are more frequently illegal than passive devices. Drivers may flash their lights to approaching drivers to warn them of a speed trap. The legal standing of this action also varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, it is common for motorists with Citizen's Band (CB) radios to report the location of speed traps over the CB radio to other motorists. In 2006, the UK Automobile Association controversially published a road map that included the location for thousands of speed cameras—the first time such information was available in printed form, although more accurate and frequently updated GPS-based information was freely available for some time before that. Mobile applications such as Njection, Trapster, and Waze provide mobile information to drivers on speed traps and traffic conditions. These applications rely on users to keep the databases current. In addition to mobile applications that might be considered evasion-centric, there are other similar mobile applications that are classified as Intelligent speed adaptation technologies that are considered too compliance centric and in Australia both National and State Road Safety Strategies encourage the adoption of such technologies. In Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, the location of speed traps are announced using the Highway location marker at regular intervals on major radio stations. Conversely, announcing the exact location of a speed trap is illegal in France.  Controversy  Groups such as the National Motorists Association define speed trap more narrowly as a place where \\"traffic enforcement is focused on extracting revenue from drivers instead of improving safety\\". When highway speed limits drop suddenly just as they enter a municipality which collects large amounts of revenue from traffic tickets, a safety hazard can be introduced, and efforts have been made in the U.S. to ban this practice. Some police forces have even been forced to disband as a result of overzealous enforcement. However, a meta-analysis of studies finds automated ticketing machines that enforce speed limits may have reduced the number of traffic injuries and deaths. Lottery Kevin Richardson proposed the idea of rewarding drivers travelling at or below the posted limit with a cash lottery, funded by the fines on speeding drivers. This was demonstrated in Stockholm, Sweden, in November 2010. Tolerances Speed limits may not be enforced for speeds close to the legal limit. In the United States, speeding enforcement tolerance is usually up to the discretion of the arresting officer. Some states (such as Pennsylvania and Florida) have official tolerances. As older vehicle construction regulations allowed a speedometer accuracy of +/- 10%, in the United Kingdom ACPO guidelines recommend a tolerance level of the speed limit \\"×10% +2 mph\\" (e.g., a maximum tolerance in a zone of 30 + (30 × 10% = 3) + 2 = 35 mph). In Germany, at least a 3 km/h tolerance (3% of measured speed when speeding over 100 km/h) in favor of the offender is always deducted. This tolerance can increase up to 20% depending on the method of measurement. Fines for speeding depend on how high above the speed limit the measured speed is and where the offense occurred. Speeding in built-up areas invariably carries higher fines than outside city limits. While fines for minor offenses tend to be moderate, speeds in excess of above the limit in built-up areas result in distinctly higher fines and points on the driver's license, and, depending on the speed at which the offender was clocked, may lead to a driving ban of at least one month. The state of Victoria in Australia allows for only a tolerance for mobile speed cameras and for fixed cameras on the basis that, although the increased risk is lower, there are very many more drivers involved, which creates a substantial risk across the road network. An alternative view is that police devices are accurate to 1 km/h, and that a 2–3 km/h tolerance is the minimum margin that police require to defeat any challenge in court regarding the accuracy of their speed measurement equipment. Speed tolerance in New South Wales was an election issue in 2011, following a move by the budget committee of the previous Labor state government to abolish the 3 km/h margin in order to increase revenue. In Mexico, the maximum speed limit is on urban freeways on other urban roads. However, fines are only given when speeding above , thus giving a tolerance. The Mexican highway patrol (Mexico City) and traffic law enforcement officers (Guadalajara) may enforce speed laws only when a car is speeding above reasonable speeds in regard of the amount of traffic. Maximum speed for all Mexican highways is . Speeding fines are given to those going and up to . Police may however place a squad car as a pace car so drivers behind cannot exceed ; this is common during Summer and Winter holiday season. Speed limit policy can affect enforcement. According to a 1994 report by the AASHTO, \\"experience has shown that speed limits set arbitrarily below the reasonable and prudent speed perceived by the public are difficult to enforce, produce noncompliance, encourage disrespect for the law, create unnecessary antagonism toward law enforcement officers, and divert traffic to lesser routes\\". A study of over 1000 drivers caught speeding in the U.S. and in Canada examined factors that predicted fines issued by police officers. In both countries, drivers were stopped for speeding on average 26 km/h (16 mph) over the speed limit and received fines of approximately US$144. As expected, drivers traveling at higher speeds over the limit received higher fines. What drivers said to the police also affected the amount of the fine. 46% percent of drivers in the study reported offering an excuse (e.g. \\"I didn't realize the speed I was driving\\"), which was the most common type of verbal response. Excuses, justifications, and denials did not reduce the amount of the fine. Almost 30% of drivers expressed remorse (e.g., \\"I'm sorry\\") and received a considerable reduction in fines. Offers of remorse were most effective at higher speeds over the limit. For example, American speeders who offered remorse for traveling at higher speeds over the limit (21 mph) received fines that were US$49 lower than drivers who were speeding the same amount, but did not offer an apology. Although this research indicated that apologies can be related to lower fines for speeding, most drivers who offered remorse were still punished to some degree. To maintain a relatively normal sample of speeders, a small percentage of drivers who reported extreme speeds (80 km/h (50 mph) or more over the limit) or very severe fines (US$500 or more) were excluded. Law enforcement approaches Local conditions, law and police practices mean that the tactics adopted to catch speeding motorists vary considerably. In some regions, police may adopt a more subtle approach, concealing themselves and their equipment as much as possible; other jurisdictions require highly visible policing, with cameras painted yellow, and camera operators not permitted to use approaches such as attaching the camera to what may appear to be a broken-down vehicle when enforcing speed limits. Authorities are not able to monitor every vehicle on every road—limited resources generally mean that enforcement needs to be targeted. A New Zealand study concluded that actual enforcement as well as the perceived chance of being caught both contributed to changes in drivers' behaviour. = Jurisdictional reciprocity = Many jurisdictions operate traffic violations reciprocity where non-resident drivers are treated like residents when they are stopped for a traffic offense that occurs in another jurisdiction. They also ensure that penalties such as demerit points and the ensuing increase in insurance premiums follow the driver home. The general principle of such interstate, inter-provincial, and/or international compacts is to guarantee the rule 'one license, one record.' Extrajudicial enforcement In 2001, Acme-Rent-a-Car in Connecticut controversially tried to use a contractual clause in the rental agreement to issue speeding fines to any of its customers that exceeded speed limits as detected by GPS tracking units its cars. The company actions were challenged and defeated in court. =Photo-enforcement employee deaths= Doug Georgianni, 51, was shot as he operated a photo radar van on a Phoenix freeway and later died at a hospital. =Reprisal attacks on equipment= Retribution attacks on photo enforcement equipment have become commonplace throughout the world. Regional issues =Australia= New South Wales In August 2005, in Sydney, Australia a speed camera photograph was challenged on the basis that an MD5 cryptographic hash function used to protect the digital photograph from tampering was not robust enough to guarantee that it had not been altered. Magistrate Lawrence Lawson demanded that the Roads and Traffic Authority (RTA) produce an expert witness who could prove the photographs were tamper-proof, but the RTA was unable to provide such evidence. The defendant was acquitted and awarded court costs. In June 2011, the New South Wales (NSW) government was reported to have raised million over the previous five years from speed cameras. The Roads Minister accused the previous Labor government of using speed cameras to raise revenue; the Auditor-General was therefore tasked with investigating all 141 fixed speed cameras in use throughout the state. Following the release of the report, 38 speed cameras, located primarily on highways, were switched off after the Auditor-General determined that they had no significant road safety benefit. The report found the majority of fixed speed cameras had a proven road safety benefit. The report also concluded that it was \\"too early\\" to conclude if mobile speed cameras affected road safety, although early results indicated drivers might be speeding less. To address public concerns, the RTA would now monitor the effectiveness of individual fixed speed cameras annually.Report finds speed cameras are an effective safety tool Media Release The Hon Duncan Gay MLC Minister for Roads and Ports 27 July 2011NSW Government switches off 38 speed cameras Caradvice 27 July 2011 (includes locations of cameras turned off) South Australia It is predicted that the South Australia (SA) government will raise million in the 2011–12 year from speed limit enforcement activities. They raised A$114 million in 2010–11. The SA government are resisting moves by their opposition to commission an inquiry into whether speed cameras are being used effectively and efficiently: to improve road safety, to raise revenue, or both. Victoria Gatso Mobile Speed Camera, used in Victoria, Australia. The camera is mounted on the passenger side dash, whilst the black box on the front is the radar unit. In 2004, in a Poltech fixed speed camera on Melbourne's Western Ring Road recorded a four-cylinder Datsun 120Y sedan travelling at 158 km/h, but testing found this vehicle only capable of 117 km/h. A Victorian state government inquiry found that maintenance and accuracy checks had not been done regularly. Victoria achieved record low road tolls in both 2008 and 2009. Newspaper reports credited a co- ordinated and well-funded campaign that focused on higher risk young drivers, more aggressive policing, increased police activity, drink driving, and in 2009, a 50% increase in the use of mobile speed cameras. After a growing number of complaints about incorrect and inappropriate fines, Victoria's Auditor-General plans to investigate whether speed cameras are being used primarily to raise revenue for the state government rather than to improve road safety. In June 2011, in Victoria, the road toll for the year so far was reported to be \\"significantly higher\\"\\" than it was for the same period of the previous year. The Victoria government forecasts that a revenue of million will be raised from fines levied on drivers breaking Victorian road rules, a large proportion being from speed limit enforcement, in 2011. =Canada= Speed limit enforcement cameras were a substantial election issue in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, and were abolished by Premiers Mike Harris in 1995 and Gordon Campbell in 2001. In February 2006, Edmonton, Alberta, erupted in scandal when it was alleged that two police officers accepted bribes from private contractors who received lucrative contracts to provide speed limit enforcement cameras. The officers and contractor involved now face criminal charges that remain before the courts. In September 2012, Edmonton police chief Rod Knecht proposed that \\"excessive speeders\\" should have their vehicles seized and impounded, after a rash of high speeding drivers were charged, many driving 50 - 100km/hr over the speed limit. =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom uses a variety of methods to enforce its road speed limits including average and instantaneous speed cameras, however eight counties are to switch off or remove cameras and a further two counties are considering such action. There has also been debate as to whether the use of such cameras in order to force a driver to confess to the crime of speeding is in violation of European basic human rights; however, in 2007 the European Court of Human Rights, in O’Halloran and Francis v United Kingdom, found there was no breach of article 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 in requiring the keepers of cars caught speeding on camera to provide the name of the driver, or to be subject to criminal penalty of an equivalent degree of severity if they failed to do so. The number of designated traffic officers fell from 15–20% of Police force strength in 1966 to seven per cent of force strength in 1998, and between 1999 and 2004 by 21%. It is an item of debate whether the reduction in traffic accidents per 100 million miles driven over this time has been due to robotic enforcement. In the seven-month period following speed cameras in Oxfordshire being switched off in August 2010, fatalities increased from 12 to 18, a figure not out of line with the variation in fatalities over a ten-year period. Plans had been made to switch the cameras back on by November 2010, on the basis of increased speeds at camera sites, which occurred in April 2011. Oxfordshire had followed the lead of Swindon, which encountered a decline in casualties, serious injuries, and fatalities. =United States= In the U.S. state of Ohio, the issue of whether a city has jurisdiction under the Ohio Constitution to issue citations based on speed cameras was heard by the Ohio Supreme Court on 18 September 2007, in the case of Kelly Mendenhall et al. v. The City of Akron et al. The court ruled in favor of Kelly Mendenhall. Patagonia, Arizona, has been cited on the National Motorists Association's speedtrap.org website as having one of the nation's most active speed traps. City police regularly conceal their patrol cars behind trees along Arizona Highway 82 where motorists enter the city's outskirts. The legal speed limit drops in a short space from 55 mph to 30 mph, leading to some drivers who are not alert to be caught. The minimum fine for exceeding the posted speed limit even by 1 mph is $146. Initially, Illinois used photo enforcement for construction zones only. There was legislation on the books to expand that throughout the state. However, Chicago has expanded its red light camera program and is planning to put speed cameras in school zones. Some suburbs (e.g. Alsip) already have cameras at various intersections. Some U.S. states that formerly allowed red-light enforcement cameras but not speed limit enforcement cameras ('photo radar'), have now approved, or are considering, the implementation of speed limit enforcement cameras. The Maryland legislature approved such a program in January 2006. In 2005, 2006, 2008 and 2009 the California legislature considered, but did not pass, bills to implement speed limit enforcement cameras. Tennessee legislators are also considering expanding their speed limit enforcement cameras after successes in Chattanooga such as generating $158,811 in revenue in the first three months. A 2007 study of speed cameras on the Arizona State Route 101 in Scottsdale found a 50% reduction in the total crash frequency, with injuries falling by 40% however rear-end collisions increased by 55%. As of late 2008, cameras were placed along all Phoenix area freeways capturing drivers doing speeds greater than 11 mph over the posted speed limit. Over 100 new cameras were expected to be up and running by 2009. As of 2009, speed cameras existed in 48 communities in the United States, including in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington, and Washington, D.C. In 2017, the National Safety Council graded states on road safety measures such as automated enforcement of speeding or red light cameras, interstate speed limits, and lower speed limits in school zones. In the United States, it is common for all installation, operation, and verification procedures to be carried out by private companies that in some States receive payment based on the number of infringements they issue, and often under no testing regime whatsoever,San Diego Court Ruling, 2001. however these units are required by law to take at least two pictures of each vehicle.US Department Of Transportation Federal Highway Administration – Traffic Enforcement Camera Regulations , 9 December th 2008. Opposition groups have formed in some locations where automated traffic enforcement has been used. In the US city of Scottsdale Arizona, an activist group CameraFraud was formed and staged sign- wave protests and petition drives to oppose the use of speed limit enforcement cameras ('photo radar'). In the 2008 elections in nearby Pinal County, Paul Babeau won an election for sheriff after making a campaign promise to eliminate speed cameras. It has been announced that Arizona will not renew its contract with Redflex, the company that operates the cameras. However, many towns in Arizona (e.g. Chandler, Mesa, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley, Superior) still have red light and/or speed cameras. Photo enforcement is illegal in the town of Gilbert, Arizona. Tempe, Arizona has removed all of their red light cameras. Baker, Louisiana still contracts with Redflex. This association is the subject of legislative action.http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2009/la-hb480.pdf = France = In France, the fixed speed cameras on motorways are announced with a sign about half to 2 km before: Pour votre sécurité, contrôles automatiques (For your safety, automatic controls) and marked in French motorway maps. On non- motorway roads, sometimes there is a sign however in other locations an electronic sign showing your speed may indicate a fixed speed camera further along the road. Average speed cameras now operate in some areas. = Switzerland = In Switzerland, it is strictly forbidden to announce speed controls. If the software of navigation equipment includes the locations of fixed speed cameras, the devices can be seized and destroyed. This also applies to mobile phones or handheld devices with the appropriate function. = Germany = In Germany, radar detectors are prohibited, however, current mobile controls are mentioned by some radio stations, which is not illegal. = Italy = In Italy, the fixed speed cameras on motorways and highways are announced with a sign no less than 250 meters before (no less than 150 meters on urban roads and no less than 80 meters on the other roads): Controllo elettronico della velocità, and marked in Italian road maps. = Netherlands = In the Netherlands, red light cameras are often combined with speed cameras in the same unit. =Spain and Portugal= In Spain and Portugal devices are used to detect drivers who drive too fast, and consequently traffic lights turn to red to stop the vehicle.http://www.racfoundation.org/assets/rac_foundation/content/downloadables/speed_limits- box_bayliss-aug2012.pdf See also *Speed limits by country References Category:Traffic law Category:Road safety Category:Law enforcement Category:Road traffic management Category:Traffic enforcement cameras Category:Road speed limit he:מכמונת מהירות ms:Perangkap laju ","title":"Speed limit enforcement"},{"id":"27104749","text":"Anna Fienberg is an Australian writer of young adult fiction and children's literature.

In both his creative and critical writing, he is concerned with contemporary multi-ethnic Hawaii society, particularly social relations between its residents of Native Hawaiian, Japanese, Caucasian, and Puerto Rican descent; the 1970s \\"Hawaiian Renaissance\\" movement and the disappearance of its legendary cultural icon George Helm of Protect Kaho'olawe Ohana (PKO); and the postmodern juxtaposition of popular artistic forms (the detective novel, cinema, crime fiction, rock music) with high literature. Shaped by genre fiction of the postwar period, his regional stories influenced that of Generation X/millennial authors such as Chris McKinney and Alexei Melnick, \\"urban Honolulu\\" novelists known for their gritty, realistic approaches to depicting crime, drugs, and lower-class life in the islands. Though he had authored earlier works of short fiction, Morales first came to notice on the Hawai\`i literary scene when he edited Ho\`i Ho\`i Hou: A Tribute to George Helm and Kimo Mitchell, for Bamboo Ridge Press (1984). During the post-Statehood period from the 1960s through the 1990s, in Hawai\`i publishing circles and English classes, \\"local\\" literature of the islands had been largely limited to, first, European American fiction and poetry by or about haole residents of Hawai\`i, and, later, \\"pidgin\\" (Hawai\`i Creole English) literature set in Hawai\`i, largely by or about Asian immigrants and their descendants. Morales, along with fellow writer-editors Richard Hamasaki and Dennis Kawaharada, were key figures in the \\"local literature\\" movement who actively promoted Native Hawaiian writing and storytelling in the late twentieth-century, publishing community. Morales wrote his first novel, When the Shark Bites (2002), over a six-year period. He drew from actual events in Hawaii social and political history—such as the suspicious vanishing of Helm and fellow Native Hawaiian activist Kimo Mitchell in the late 1970s, and the Hawaiian sovereignty movement which exploded by the 1990s—blending known, local figures into fictionalized characters within a multiple-perspective, mystery/crime genre story. Literary scholar Susan Najita found similarities in the book's thematic content with the writer's collection of short stories (The Speed of Darkness, 1988), calling the millennial novel \\"an extension of this earlier work in both its fictionalization of the events following Helm's disappearance and in Morales's deft interweaving of history, colonial resistance movements, popular culture, and native Hawaiian tradition.\\" When the Shark Bites is a modern-day detective story in which an indigenous Hawaiian doctoral student, Alika, investigates the mysterious disappearance of native Hawaiian activist Keoni in the late 1970s. Morales has said of the technique of combining regional history with mainstream genre fiction, \\"A novel is a way to bring in all the different worlds I know.\\" His second novel, For A Song (2016), blends noir, mystery, and detective-fiction genre tropes, against the backdrop of political scandal and police corruption in contemporary Honolulu. Morales' protagonist, the hard-boiled detective David \\"Kawika\\" Apana, is consulted by a Native Hawaiian, female activist and filmmaker, whose case sends him from urban Honolulu to the semi-rural windward and north coasts of O\`ahu island, into the shadier, complex layers of Hawaii society about which few know and fewer even dare speak. Morales has given public talks about how he uses local Hawaii, historical, archival, and news/journalistic research to breathe life into his characters. Morales won the prestigious Grand Prize of the Honolulu Magazine Fiction Contest twice. In 2004, he was selected for the \\"established writer\\" category of the Cades Award for Literature, one of two key literary honors offered by the Hawai'i Literary Arts Council.

It is Grade II* listed. St George's Church is the principal parish church, and is in the centre of Beckenham.St George's Parish Church Beckenham Website Originally medieval, it has been extensively rebuilt. It has a 13th-century timber lychgate that is said to be the oldest in England.Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2005, St George’s church History Lych gate The church was originally built in the twelfth century and survived as a humble medieval church until it was rebuilt between 1885 and 1887 as a “confident town church” by local architect W. Gibbs Bartleet in ragstone with ashlar dressing. The pinnacled southwest tower is the focal point of the High Street and was completed in 1902–1903. The church sustained damage in the Second World War as a result of two V-1 flying bombs, on 2 July and 27 July 1944. The modern stained glass was created between 1963–1966 by Thomas Freeth. Building The church is built in the Decorated style of the early 14th century. The most prominent feature is the tower, built in four stages with angle buttresses and terminating in an embattled parapet with pinnacles at the corners and also in the middle of each side. Across the West end of the nave is a narthex with a gabled head in the centre. In the west wall of the nave is a very large window filled with a circle of intricate flowing tracery. The nave has a clerestory with pairs of two light windows in each bay with flowing tracery while the lean-to aisles have three-light windows with varied Decorated tracery. The transepts have large windows with a transom: each has a different design in the tracery but in both cases based on a circle. At the east end the chancel has a low parapet pierced with trefoils, a five-sided apse and crocketed pinnacles at the angles of the apse. The roof over the nave has hammerbeams and that over the chancel is a keel shape. The oldest feature is a much-damaged square 12th- or 13th-century baptismal font. It had originally been in the old church (taken out c1801 and returned 1876). The font in use today is a conventional octagonal Victorian one. In the apse of the Lady chapel is a piscina with credence shelf that also came from the previous church. Extensive amounts of the Victorian pewing and stalls remain. The pulpit is polygonal, has open sides and stands on a stone base of 1906. There is Victorian stained glass in a number of windows, notably the large west window and that in the south wall of the south transept. Much was lost in World War II and extensive replacement took place from c1960. The artist was Thomas Freeth, an art teacher at Beckenham Art School. His first work was the west window in the former baptistry and his designs fill the apse windows and thirteen other windows throughout the church. The numerous monuments, many of outstanding quality by monumental masons such as Thomas Adye, John Hickey, John Flaxman, Sir Frances Chantrey, Henry Weekes and Gaffin, were transferred from the old church to the new, as was the church plate. William, Lord Auckland has his memorial within the church and was buried in the churchyard, which features a number of good eighteenth-century gravestones.John Newman. West Kent and the Weald.

Biography Born at Newport, in County Mayo, eight miles from Castlebar, Arthur was educated at Horton College, and at the age of twenty was sent to Goobbee, in Southern India, where he was engaged for several years in missionary work in the Mysore.The Irish Nation: its history and its biography, Volume 4 (1876), p. 557-58. While there his progress in the Canarese language is said to have been remarkable; but being threatened with blindness, he was obliged to return to Europe, and was employed for three years in advocating with much ability the Indian missionary work of the Wesleyan Society. He acted in his ministerial capacity in Paris from 1846 to 1849; then for seventeen years he filled the post of secretary to the Methodist Missionary Society. In 1867 he was elected Principal of the Methodist College Belfast, and continued to fill that office until 1871, when he resigned, but still maintained his connection with the Conference as honorary missionary secretary. In 1866-67 he was President of the Wesleyan Conference. Arthur was best known as the author of numerous pamphlets and books including: * A Mission to the Mysore, with Scenes and Facts Illustrative of India, its People, and its Religion (1847) * The Successful Merchant— Sketches of the Life of Mr Samuel Budgett (1852) ** This was a bestseller: in the UK a 43rd edition was published in 1878 by William Mullan and Son. ** In the US, editions included: Swormstedt & Poe, Cincinnati (1856), Carlton & Phillips, New York (1853) and D. Appleton, New York (1857).ABE Books Accessed 4 June 2009 ** It was also translated into Welsh * The Tongue of Fire, or true Power of Christianity (1856) * Italy in Transition: Public Scenes and Private Opinions in the Spring of 1860, illustrated by Official Documents from the Papal Archives of the Revolted Legations (1860) His lecture on Systematic Beneficence gave the first impetus to that movement; and his own practice was referred to as a living example of it. His intimate knowledge of India and its people made his counsel valuable to statesmen; and it was widely acknowledged that he was a power outside his own Church, and an aggressive proponent of Christianity. Arthur suffered various infirmities throughout his life, but lived to the age of 83, dying in Cannes, France.Nolan B. Harmon, The Encyclopedia of World Methodism, Volume One (1974), p. 145-146.

A., & Cromroy, H. L. (2012). Tropical Fowl Mite, Ornithonyssus bursa (Berlese)(Arachnida: Acari: Macronyssidae). University of Florida. Fact Sheet EENY-297. It is most often a parasite of birds, but also has been found to bite humans and two species of mammals. It usually lives in birds' feathers, but for laying its eggs, it more often uses their nests rather than their feathers. Tropical fowl mites undergo five stages during their development: egg, larva, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. During the last two stages, they suck blood from their host for food. They are often diurnal, whereas northern fowl mites are nocturnal in nature. Synonyms O. bursa has been described under the following synonyms, which are no longer used: * Leiognathus bursa Berlese (1888) * Liponyssus bursa Hirst (1916) * Ornithonyssus bursa Sambon (1928) Description O. bursa has four pairs of legs, three of which are located on the sternal plate. Towards its posterior end, its body narrows slightly. These two features distinguish it from another member of the genus, Ornithonyssus sylviarum, whose posterior end narrows considerably and which possesses only two pairs of legs on its sternal plate. Effects on humans O. bursa can move from birds' nests into human homes. It also infests domestic fowl and can spread to humans handling fowl.

Her debut album was released in the US and Europe on the label Cumbancha and in Brazil by Oi Música in May 2010. Biography Maita was born in São Paulo, Brazil on April 27, 1982, into a musical family. Her father, Amado Maita, was a composer and musician and her mother, Myriam Taubkin, is a singer and music producer. Her name derives from a song by the bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim, whom her parents also named her two sisters after. The samba was present in Luisa's early days because of the experiences of her father in Bixiga, a working-class neighborhood in São Paulo famous for its culture, food, and music. As a child at home, Maita started singing samba, bossa nova, and her father's compositions, and at the age of seven began recording jingles. In 2001, Maita founded her first band, Urbanda, with Morris Picciotto, but eventually left to pursue a solo career. Maita sang in a 2009 promotional video directed by Fernando Meirelles for the 2016 Olympics bid, wrote two songs for Virginia Rosa's album Samba a Dois (2006), and wrote \\"Beleza\\" with Rodrigo Campos for Mariana Aydar's second album, which was one of the best songs of 2009 according to Rolling Stone Brazil magazine. In 2010, Maita released her first solo album, Lero-Lero on Cumbancha. She says the title means \\"an informal conversation\\". Maita wrote a number of the songs, with others arranged by string expert Paulo Lepetit and bassist Rodrigo Campos, who both perform on the album. Cumbancha also released a remixed version of Lero-Lero in the same year, entitled Maita Remixed. In November 2010, Maita made her first North America tour. During the tour, she appeared on NPR's Tiny Desk Concert and KCWR's Morning Becomes Eclectic show. In Brazil, the album appeared in lists of the best albums of 2010, including in the magazines Veja and Rolling Stone Brasil. In July 2011, Maita received the award for Best New Artist in the twenty-second edition of the Brazilian Music Award, and went on her first European tour, playing in festivals such as Nuits du Sud in France and Musicas do Mundo in Portugal. The 2014 coming-of-age film Boyhood, directed by Richard Linklater, featured two of Maita's songs, including \\"Lero-Lero\\". Maita's second solo album, Fio da Memória, or \\"threads of memory\\", was released by Cumbancha in 2016.  Genre and influences  Lero-Lero combines influences from alternative pop, downtempo electronica, MPB (música popular brasileira), samba, and bossa nova all on an acoustic base. The overall sound of her album Fio da Memória was inspired by the bustle of the city in São Paulo. Maita cites Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, Michael Jackson, Sade, Kid Cudi, and Nana Vasconcelos as inspirations for her music. As a child, her parents introduced her to João Gilberto, Nana Caymmi, Vinicius de Moraes, Milton Nascimento, Edu Lobo, and Baden Powell. Some of the rhythms in her album are drawn from the Afro-Brazilian martial art capoeira.

Curtis for manipulating the Mathieu groups, binary Golay code and Leech lattice. Description The Miracle Octad Generator is a 4x6 array of combinations describing any point in 24-dimensional space. It preserves all of the symmetries and maximal subgroups of the Mathieu group M24, namely the monad group, duad group, triad group, octad group, octern group, sextet group, trio group and duum group. It can therefore be used to study all of these symmetries. Golay code Another use for the Miracle Octad Generator is to quickly verify codewords of the binary Golay code. Each element of the Miracle Octad Generator can store either a '1' or a '0', usually displayed as an asterisk and blank space, respectively. Each column and the top row have a property known as the count, which is the number of asterisks in that particular line. One of the criteria for a set of 24 coordinates to be a codeword in the binary Golay code is for all seven counts to be of the same parity. The other restriction is that the scores of each column form a word in the hexacode. The score of a column can be either 0, 1, ω, or ω-bar, depending on its contents. The score of a column is evaluated by the following rules: * If a column contains exactly one asterisk, it has a score of 0 if it resides in the top row, 1 if it is in the second row, ω for the third row, and ω-bar for the bottom row. * Simultaneously complementing every bit in a column does not affect its score. * Complementing the bit in the top row does not affect its score, either. A codeword can be derived from just its top row and score, which proves that there are exactly 4096 codewords in the binary Golay code. MiniMOG John Horton Conway developed a 4 × 3 array known as the MiniMOG. The MiniMOG provides the same function for the Mathieu group M12 and ternary Golay code as the Miracle Octad Generator does for M24 and binary Golay code, respectively. Instead of using a quaternary hexacode, the MiniMOG uses a ternary tetracode.

The Stanley Theater first opened in 1927, but due to its location in the outskirts of Newark, it ran second-run to the circuit's downtown Branford Theater. By the early 1970s, the Stanley Theater was no longer profitable and got sold to an Italian-American cultural organization that turned it into a social hall called Casa Italiana.

This can result in water loss from the affected area and cause the whitening and drying of the skin which may result in cracking, secondary infection and chemical irritant contact dermatitis. Cause Prolonged defatting of the skin can lead to dermatitis. Here the hands and wrists of a worker display chronic dermatitis resulting from long term exposure to kerosene. Defatting is caused by the exposure of human skin to a chemical substance, including alcohols, detergents, chemical solvents and motor oil. Aliphatic compounds (commonly found in kerosene) cause defatting action, with lower-boiling point aliphatics having the greatest defatting action and therefore the most potential to cause dermatitis. Aromatic compounds, such as styrene, also have a defatting capacity. Prevention  Defatting can be prevented by wearing appropriate protective clothing such as gloves, lab coats and aprons when working regularly with defatting agents. Prolonged skin contact or chronic defatting of the skin increases the possibility for developing irritant contact dermatitis and has the potential to worsen pre-existing skin conditions. Patients with chronic dermatitis are advised to use non-irritating soaps and dishwashing liquids sparingly and to choose those with a neutral pH and minimal defatting capability.

Speakers from a number of countries discussed race relations and how to improve them. The congress, with 2,100 attendees, was organised by prominent humanists of that era; it was conceived of a result of comments in 1906 by Felix Adler and primarily executed by Gustav Spiller, a leader in the British Ethical Union (now Humanists UK). Philip Stanhope was president of the congress, and William Pember Reeves chaired its executive committee. Mission The call for the congress included these remarks: > To discuss, in the light of science and modern conscience, the general > relations subsisting between the peoples of the West and those of the East, > between the so-called \\"white\\" and the so-called \\"colored\\" peoples, with a > view to encouraging between them a fuller understanding, the most friendly > feelings, and the heartier co-operation.… The interchange of material and > other wealth between the races of mankind has of late years assumed such > dimensions that the old attitude of distrust and aloofness is giving way to > a genuine desire for a closer acquaintanceship. Out of this interesting > situation has sprang the idea of holding a Congress where the > representatives of the different races might meet each other face to face, > and might, in friendly rivalry, further the cause of mutual trust and > respect between the Occident and Orient, between the so-called \\"white\\" > peoples and the so-called \\"colored\\" peoples. =Work= More than 50 countries and 20 governments sent representatives, resulting in 58 papers which were categorized into five groups: * Fundamental considerations * Conditions of progress * Problems of interracial economics and peaceful contact between civilizations * Conscience in relation to racial questions * Suggestions for promoting interracial relations Resolutions resulting from the congress were: * To urge that the establishment of harmonious relations between the divisions of mankind is a prerequisite to any attempt to diminish warfare and extend the practice of arbitration. * To recommend to individuals of different races contacting one another courteous and respectful conduct and the study of customs and civilizations of other peoples. All civilizations have much to teach, and should be respected for their deep, historic roots. * To emphasize that differences in civilization do not connote either inferiority or superiority. * To study the physical and social effects of race-blending, and what promotes (or hinders) it. * To request governments to compile statistics on the subject, and discourage hasty and crude generalizations. * To point out the absurdity of the belief prevalent among peoples of the world that their customs, their civilization, andtheir physique are superior to those of other peoples, and to deprecate the looseness with which the term \\"race\\" is employed. * To urge the importance of providing in all lands a universal, efficient system of education – physical, intellectual, and moral – as a principal means of promoting cordial relations among all divisions of mankind. * To respect (or endeavor to assimilate or change) the economic, hygienic, educational and moral standards of immigrants rather that to seeing them as indefensible or fixed. * To collect records of experiments showing the humane uplift of relatively backward people, and to urge the universal application of such methods. Participants Principal delegates at the first Universal Races Congress, 1911 Felix Adler was the delegate from the United States National Bureau of Education, as it was then known. Anthropologist Franz Boas, an outspoken opponent of racism, spoke on ‘’The Instability of Human Types’’, which questioned the very notion of race and racial purity. British anthropologist and ethnologist Alfred Cort Haddon wrote a paper for the journal Science about the congress. Bengali humanist philosopher Brajendra Nath Seal, a proponent of Brahmo Samaj who worked in comparative religion, delivered an address entitled \\"Race Origin\\" introducing the concept of group divergence as it relates to human evolutionary genetics and the effects of reproductive isolation.The Evolution of the D2\\\\- Statistic of Mahalanobis by Somesh Dasguta, published in Indian J. Pure Appl. Math., 26(6) : 485–501, June 1995. Writer, physician and reformer Charles Eastman, a Santee Sioux and Anglo-American who was active in politics and Native American rights, represented the American Indian at the congress. Sarah J. Garnet accompanied her sister Susan McKinney Steward, who delivered her paper (\\"Colored American Women\\") to the congress. The pioneering physician Frances Hoggan spoke. W. E. B. Du Bois observed that the congress could clarify the state of scientific knowledge about the meaning of \\"race\\" and presented his paper, \\"The Negro Race in the United States of America\\".\\"Partial Speech by Du Bois\\", Anonymous. 1911. \\"The First Universal Race Congress in London, England.\\" The American Missionary, vol. 45, no. 9 (September): 323–324. Mary White Ovington, co-founder of the NAACP, was in attendance and Mojola Agbebi, an advocate of self-governance for African churches, delivered a paper. William Sanders Scarborough was the delegate from Wilberforce University, the first African-American-owned college in the United States. The head of the Bahá'í Faith, \`Abdu'l-Bahá, was invited to speak; he sent representatives, a letter and presentations by a number of Bahá'ís.Immediately before \`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West, the entire Star of the West, vol. 2, no. 9, the main serial magazine covering the religion in the West at the time, was devoted to presentations by leading Bahá'ís at the congress. Other religious speakers included Thomas William Rhys Davids, Genchi Kato and Alfred Caldecott. Attendees who did not speak at the Congress also included some present and future social reformers. Among them were Hull House founder Jane Addams, psychologist John Dewey, author H.G. Wells, and a man listed as a “barrister-at-law” in Johannasburg, South Africa, Mohandas Gandhi. After the congress, Dusé Mohamed Ali founded the African Times and Orient Review in London. Its first issue proclaimed that \\"the recent Universal Races Congress, convened in the Metropolis of the Anglo-Saxon world, clearly demonstrated that there was ample need for a Pan-Oriental, Pan-African journal in the seat of the British Empire\\".

The sculpture was probably commissioned for the Baptistery of Florence. The piece was received with astonishment for its unprecedented realism. It is now in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence. The wood used by Donatello is that of White poplar. Iconography Though the \\"Penitent Magdalene\\" was the usual depiction for the many single figures of Mary Magdalene in art, Donatello's gaunt, emaciated figure differs greatly from most depictions, which show a beautiful young woman in nearly perfect health. The Magdalene Penitent is famous for the detailed and very realistic carvings on the statue. Medieval hagiography in the Western church had conflated the figure of Mary Magdalene, already conflated with Mary of Bethany and the unnamed sinner in the Anointing of Jesus, with that of Saint Mary of Egypt. She was a popular figure in the Eastern Churches, who had been a prostitute before spending thirty years repenting in the desert. Donatello's depiction is similar to, and very probably influenced by, Eastern Orthodox icons of Mary of Egypt, which show a similar emaciated figure. He thus ignored the Western legends by which Mary was daily fed by angels in the desert. History Documentation about the work is scarce. The earliest mentioning of the Penitent Magdalene dates from 1500 and mentions that the statue is being placed back in the Baptistery in Florence against the southwest wall. Since then, the statue has been moved a few times: in 1688 it was replaced by the baptismal font and put in storage, in 1735 it was moved back to the Baptistery against the southeast wall and in 1912 it was put back against the southwest wall. Today, being moved after restoration, it can be seen in the Sala della Maddalena in the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence. The Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari mentions the work in his Vite: > \\"In the same baptistery, opposite this tomb, a statue from Donatello's own > hand can be seen, a wooden Saint Mary Magdalene in Penitence which is very > beautiful and well executed, for she has wasted away by fasting and > abstinence to such an extent that every part of her body reflects a perfect > and complete understanding of human anatomy.\\" Donatello executed the work when he was more than sixty years old, after he had spent a decade in Padua. The dating has been established indirectly, based on a 1455 copy from Neri di Bicci's workshop now in the Museum of the Collegiate of Empoli. In 1500 the work was in the city's baptistery. According to an Italian historian, it was seen by Charles VIII of France in the 1480s, when he was camped with his army near Florence. The work was damaged by the 1966 flood of the Arno River, and the restoration process revealed some of the statue's original polychrome and gilding. Sources Janson, H.W.

These behaviors can harm organizations or people in organizations including employees and clients, customers, or patients. It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors. For instance, an employee who is high on trait anger (tendency to experience anger) is more likely to respond to a stressful incident at work (e.g., being treated rudely by a supervisor) with CWB. Some researchers use the CWB term to subsume related constructs that are distinct. Workplace deviance is behavior at work that violates norms for appropriate behavior. Retaliation consists of harmful behaviors done by employees to get back at someone who has treated them unfairly. Workplace revenge are behaviors by employees intended to hurt another person who has done something harmful to them.Bies, R. J., Tripp, T. M., & Kramer, R. M. (1997). At the breaking point: Cognitive and social dynamics of revenge in organizations. In R. A. Giacalone & J. Greenberg (Eds.), Antisocial behavior in organizations. (pp. 18-36). Thousand Oaks, CA, US: Sage Publications, Inc. Workplace aggression consists of harmful acts that harm others in organizations.Neuman, J. H., & Baron, R. A. (1997). Aggression in the workplace. In R. A. Giacalone & J. Greenberg (Eds.), Antisocial behavior in organizations. (pp. 37-67). Thousand Oaks, CA, US: Sage Publications, Inc. Dimensional models Several typologies of CWB exist. Using the term deviance (behavior that violates accepted norms), Robinson and Bennett created a four-class typology of CWBs, dividing them into the following dimensions: *production deviance, involving behaviors like leaving early, intentionally working slowly, or taking long breaks; *property deviance, involving sabotage of equipment, theft of property, and taking kickbacks; *political deviance, involving showing favoritism, revenge, gossiping, or blaming others; *personal aggression, involving harassment, verbal abuse, and endangerment Bennett and Robinson (2000) created a scale to assess person-directed versus organization-directed deviance. Bennett, R. J., & Robinson, S. L. (2000). Development of a measure of workplace deviance. Journal of Applied Psychology, 85, 349-360. A five dimension typology of CWB, and a scale to assess them. *abuse against others *production deviance *sabotage *theft *withdrawal An 11-dimension typology of CWB *theft of property *destruction of property *misuse of information *misuse of time and resources *unsafe behavior *poor attendance *poor quality of work *alcohol use *drug use *inappropriate verbal action *inappropriate physical action A two- dimensional model of CWBs distinguished by organizational versus person target has gained considerable acceptance. Additional dimensions have been proposed for research purposes, including a legal v. illegal dimension, a hostile v. instrumental aggression dimension, and a task-related v. a non-task-related dimension. CWBs that violate criminal law may have different antecedents than milder forms of CWBs. Similarly, instrumental aggression (i.e., aggression with a deliberate goal in mind) may have different antecedents than those CWBs caused by anger. Dimensions =Absenteeism= Absenteeism is typically measured by time lost (number of days absent) measures and frequency (number of absence episodes) measures. It is weakly linked to affective predictors such as job satisfaction and commitment. Absences fit into two types of categories. Excused absences are those due to personal or family illness; unexcused absences include an employee who does not come to work in order to do another preferred activity or neglects to call in to a supervisor. Absence can be linked to job dissatisfaction. Major determinants of employee absence include employee affect, demographic characteristics, organizational absence culture, and organization absence policies. Absence due to non-work obligations is related to external features of a job with respect to dissatisfaction with role conflict, role ambiguity, and feelings of tension. Absences due to stress and illness are related to internal and external features of the job, fatigue and gender. Research has found that women are more likely to be absent than men, and that the absence-control policies and culture of an organization will predict absenteeism. =Abuse against others= Physical acts of aggression by members of an organization, committed in organizational settings are considered as workplace violence. While most researchers examine overall workplace aggression, there is a line of research that separates workplace aggression according to its targets, whether interpersonal or organizational. In this model of workplace aggression, trait anger and interpersonal conflict have been found to be significant predictors of interpersonal aggression, while interpersonal conflict, situational constraints, and organizational constraints have been found to be predictors of organizational aggression. Other factors significantly linked to aggression are sex and trait anger, with men and individuals with higher levels of trait anger showing more aggressive behaviors. =Bullying= Workplace bullying consists of progressive and systematic mistreatment of one employee by another. It may include verbal abuse, gossiping, social exclusion, or the spreading of rumors. The terms \\"bullying\\" and \\"mobbing\\" are sometimes used interchangeably, but \\"bullying\\" is more often used to refer to lower levels of antisocial behavior that do not include workgroup participation. The costs of bullying include losses in productivity, higher absenteeism, higher turnover rates, and legal fees when the victims of bullying sue the organization. Reported incidence of bullying is ambiguous with rates being reported from under 3% to over 37% depending on the method used to gather incidence statistics. The strongest factor predicting bullying behavior seems to be exposure to incidents of bullying. This suggests that bullying is a cascading problem that needs to be curtailed in its earliest stages. In addition to exposure to incidents of bullying, being male also seems to increase the likelihood that one will engage in bullying behavior. It is proposed that the human resources function can provide guidance in the mitigation of bullying behavior by taking an active role in identifying and stopping the behaviors. =Cyber loafing= Cyber loafing can be defined as surfing the web in any form of non-job- related tasks performed by the employee. Cyber loafing has emerged as more and more people use computers at work. One survey showed that 64% of US workers use the internet for personal tasks at work.The Straits Times. (2000). Cyberslackers at work. The Straits Times 28: 4 April. It has been suggested that cyber-loafing is responsible for a 30–40% decrease in employee productivity and was estimated to have cost US businesses $5.3 billion in 1999. =Incivility= Workplace incivility is disrespectful and rude behavior in violation of workplace norms for respect.\\" The effects of incivility include increased competitiveness, increases in sadistic behavior, and inattentiveness. A study of cyber incivility showed that higher levels of incivility are associated with lower job satisfaction, lower organizational commitment, and higher turnover rates. Two factors that seem to be associated with becoming a victim of incivility are low levels of agreeableness and high levels of neuroticism. The affective events theory suggests that individuals who experience more incidents of incivility may be more sensitive to these behaviors and therefore more likely to report them. =Knowledge hiding, knowledge hoarding, and knowledge sabotage= Counterproductive knowledge behavior refers to employees’ actions impeding organizational knowledge flows. Examples include knowledge hiding defined as the intentional attempts of employees to conceal their knowledge when their colleagues request it, knowledge hoarding which is the accumulation of knowledge by employees while concealing the fact that they possess this knowledge, and knowledge sabotage which is an incident when an employee (i.e., the saboteur) intentionally provides wrong knowledge (information, advice, a document, or a recommendation) to another employee (the target). =Lateness= Lateness is described as arriving at work later or leaving earlier than required. Problems associated with lateness include compromised organizational efficiency. Tardy and late employees responsible for critical tasks can negatively affect organizational production. Other workers may experience psychological effects of the tardy employee including morale and motivational problems as they attempt to \\"pick up the slack.\\"Cascio, W. (1987). \\"Costing human resources: The financial impact of behavior in organizations\\" (2nd ed.). Boston: Kent. Other employees may begin to imitate the example set by the behavior of tardy employees. Lateness costs US business more than $3 billion annually.DeLonzor, D. (2006). Cope creatively with the punctually challenged. HR Update. Retrieved 27 January 2007, from http://www.uaf.edu/uafhr/hr_update/Feb_06HRUpdate.pdf =Production deviance= Production deviance is ineffective job performance that is done on purpose, such as doing tasks incorrectly or withholding of effort. Such behaviors can be seen in disciplinary actions and safety violations. =Sabotage= Employee sabotage are behaviors that can \\"damage or disrupt the organization's production, damaging property, the destruction of relationships, or the harming of employees or customers.\\" Research has shown that often acts of sabotage or acts of retaliation are motivated by perceptions of organizational injustice and performed with the intention of causing harm to the target.Greenberg, J. (1996, April). \\"What motivates employee theft? An experimental test of two explanations\\". Paper presented at the 11th annual meeting of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology, San Diego, CA.  Service  Service sabotage originated from counter-productive behavior literature. Lloyd C. Harris and Emmanuel Ogbonna from Cardiff University drew from employee deviance and dysfunctional behaviors studies to conceptualize service sabotage as a disturbing phenomenon in the work place. Service sabotage refer to organizational member behaviors that are intentionally designed negatively to affect service. Empirical evidence suggested that more than 90% employees accept that service sabotage is an everyday occurrence in their organization. =Sexual harassment= Sexual harassment is defined as \\"unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical contact when (a) submission to the conduct by the employee is either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment, (b) submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting the individual and/or (c) such conduct [that] has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with work performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment.\\" (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 1980) =Substance abuse= Substance abuse by employees at work is a problem that can have an effect on work attendance, performance, and safety and can lead to other injuries outside of work and health problems. =Theft= Employee theft is defined as employees taking things not belonging to them from an organization. Employee theft is estimated to account for billions of dollars of loss globally each year, with employees accounting for more theft than customers.Hollinger, R. C., Dabney, D. A., Lee, G., Hayes, R., Hunter, J., & Cummings, M. (1996). 1996 national retail security survey final report. Gainesville: University of Florida. This may include large embezzlements or the pilfering of pencils and paperclips, but the losses in the aggregate are substantial. At least one study suggests that 45% of companies experience financial fraud, with average losses of $1.7 million. Factors such as conscientiousness have been shown to be negatively related to theft behaviors. Many organizations use integrity tests during the initial screening process for new employees in an effort to eliminate those considered most likely to commit theft. Causes of employee theft include characteristics of the individual and environmental conditions such as frustrating and unfair working conditions. =Turnover= Turnover is when employees leave the organization, either voluntarily (quitting) or involuntarily (being fired or laid off). Research on voluntary employee job turnover has attempted to understand the causes of individual decisions to leave an organization. It has been found that lower performance, lack of reward contingencies for performance, and better external job opportunities are the main causes. Other variables related to turnover are conditions in the external job market and the availability of other job opportunities, and length of employee tenure. Turnover can be optimal as when a poorly performing employee decides to leave an organization, or dysfunctional when the high turnover rates increase the costs associated with recruitment and training of new employees, or if good employees consistently decide to leave. Avoidable turnover is when the organization could have prevented it and unavoidable turnover is when the employee's decision to leave could not be prevented. The satisfaction–turnover relationship is affected by alternative job prospects. If an employee accepts an unsolicited job offer, job dissatisfaction was less predictive of turnover because the employee more likely left in response to “pull” (the lure of the other job) than “push” (the unattractiveness of the current job). Similarly, job dissatisfaction is more likely to translate into turnover when other employment opportunities are plentiful. =Withdrawal= Employee withdrawal consists of behaviors such as absence, lateness, and ultimately job turnover. Absence and lateness has attracted research as they disrupt organizational production, deliveries and services. Unsatisfied employees withdraw in order to avoid work tasks or pain, and remove themselves from their jobs.Hanisch, K. A. (1995). Organizational withdrawal. In N. N. Nicholson (Ed.), Blackwell Encyclopedic Dictionary of Organizational Behavior (p. 604). London: Blackwell. Withdrawal behavior may be explained as employee retaliation against inequity in the work setting.Martocchio, J. J. and D. A. Harrison. (1993). \\"To Be There or Not To Be There? Questions, Theories and Methods in Absenteeism Research.\\" Pp. 259-328, in Research in Personnel and Human Resources Management (Vol. 11) edited by G. R. Ferris. Greenwich, CT: JAI Press. Withdrawal may also be part of a progressive model and relate to job dissatisfaction, job involvement, and organizational commitment.Herzberg, F, Mausner, B., Peterson, R., & Capwell, D. (1957). \\"Job attitudes: Review of research and opinion\\". Pittsburgh: Psychological Services.  Notable behavior exclusions  CWBs are \\"active and volitional acts engaged in by individuals, as opposed to accidental or unintentional actions.\\" CWBs, therefore do not include acts that lack volition, such as the inability to successfully complete a task. Nor do CWBs include involvement in an accident, although purposeful avoidance of the safety rules that may have led to the accident would represent a CWB. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2002) estimates the cost of accidents to organizations to be $145 million annually. Most research on this topic has attempted to evaluate characteristics of the workplace environment that lead to accidents and determination of ways to avoid accidents. There has also been some research on the characteristics of accident-prone employees that has found they are typically younger, more distractible, and less socially adjusted than other employees. Recent research has shown that an organization's safety climate has been associated with lower accident involvement, compliance with safety procedures, and increased proactive safety behaviors. Another set of behaviors that do not fit easily into the accepted definition of CWBs, are those described as unethical pro- organizational behaviors (UPBs). UPBs represent illegitimate means intended to further the legitimate interests of an organization. UPBs are not necessarily intended to harm the organization, although the UPBs may result in adverse consequences to the organization, such as a loss of trust and goodwill, or in criminal charges against the organization. In law enforcement, UPBs are exhibited in a form of misconduct called noble cause corruption. Noble cause corruption occurs when a police officer violates the law or ethical rules in order to reduce crime or the fear of crime. An example of this is testilying, in which a police officer commits perjury to obtain the conviction of a defendant. UPBs have not received the same attention from researchers that CWBs have received.  Organizational citizenship behavior  Counterproductive work behavior and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), which consists of behaviors that help organizations but go beyond required tasks, have been studied together and are generally found to be related in that individuals who do one are unlikely to do the other.  Current research topics and trends  By definition, counterproductive work behaviors are voluntary acts that are detrimental to an organization. They have important implications for the well-being of an organization. Theft alone is estimated to cause worldwide losses in the billions of dollars each year. These estimated losses do not include losses from other sources, nor do they consider the fact that many losses attributable to CWBs go undetected. The consequences of CWBs and their persistence in the workplace have led to increased attention being given to the study of such behaviors. Current trends in industrial organizational psychology suggest a continuing increase in the study of CWBs. Research into CWBs appears to fall into three broad categories: (1) classification of CWBs; (2) predicting counterproductive behaviors; and (3) furthering the theoretical framework of CWBs. A review of peer reviewed journals following this article shows the broad interest in CWBs. A brief list of noted journals includes The International Journal of Selection and Assessment, The Journal of Applied Psychology, Computers in Human Behavior, Personality and Individual Differences, Occupational Health Psychology, Human Resource Management Review, Military Justice, Criminal Justice Ethics, European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, and International Journal of Nursing Studies. The variety of journals reporting in the area of CWBs reflects the breadth of the topic and the global interest in studying these behaviors. Researchers use many sources in attempting to measure CWBs. These include potentially subjective measures such as self-reports, peer reports, and supervisor reports. More objective methods for assessing CWBs include disciplinary records, absentee records, and job performance statistics. Each of these methods present potential problems in the measurement of CWBs. For example, self-reports always have the potential for bias with individuals trying to cast themselves in a good light. Self-reports may also cause problems for researchers when they measure what an incumbent 'can-do' and what an incumbent 'will-do.' Peer and supervisor reports can suffer from personal bias, but they also suffer from lack of knowledge of the private behaviors of the job incumbent whose behavior is being studied. Archival records suffer from lack of information about the private behaviors of incumbents, providing instead information about instances where incumbents are caught engaging in CWBs. Some researchers have proposed a differential detection hypothesis which predicts that there will be discrepancies between reports of detected CWBs and other reports of CWBs. The lack of accurate measures for CWBs jeopardizes the ability of researchers to find the relationships between CWB and other factors they are evaluating. The primary criticism of research in CWBs has been that too much of the research relies on a single-source method of measurement relying primarily on self-reports of counterproductive work behavior. Several studies have therefore attempted to compare self-reports with other forms of evidence about CWBs. These studies seek to determine whether different forms of evidence converge, or effectively measure the same behaviors. Convergence has been established between self- reports and peer and supervisor reports for interpersonal CWBs but not organizational CWBs. This finding is significant because it promotes the ability of researchers to use multiple sources of evidence in evaluating CWBs. Correlates, predictors, moderators and mediators =Affect= Affect or emotion at work, especially the experience of negative emotions like anger or anxiety, predict the likelihood of counterproductive work behaviors occurring. Affective personality traits, the tendency for individuals to experience emotions, can also predict CWB. For example, employees with high negative affectivity, the tendency to experience negative emotions, typically display more counterproductive work behaviors than those with positive affectivity, the tendency to experience positive emotions. =Age= Age appears to be an important factor in predicting CWBs. While age does not appear to be strongly related to core task performance, creativity, or performance in training, it does appear to be positively related to organizational citizenship behaviors and negatively related to CWBs. Older employees seem to exhibit less aggression, tardiness, substance abuse, and voluntary absenteeism (although sickness related absenteeism is somewhat higher than younger employees). Some researchers argue that the lower rate of CWBs may be due to better self- regulation and self-control. =Cognitive ability= Research into the relationship between cognitive ability and CWBs is contradictory. When CWBs are operationalized as disciplinary records of detected CWBs, a strong negative relationship between cognitive ability has been found. This relationship did not hold, however, when cognitive ability was operationalized as educational attainment. A longitudinal study of adolescents through young adulthood found that, among those individuals who exhibited conduct disorders as youths, high levels of cognitive ability were associated with higher levels of CWBs, a positive relationship. Other research has found that general mental ability is largely unrelated to self-reports of CWBs including theft (although a weak link to incidents of lateness was detected). In the same study, grade point average showed a stronger relationship to CWBs. Contradictions in the findings may be explained in the differential effects between measures of cognitive ability and self-reported versus detected incidents of CWBs. =Emotional intelligence= Emotional intelligence (EI) has been defined as the ability to identify and manage emotional information in oneself and others and focus energy on required behaviors. The factors making up EI include: * appraisal and expression of emotion in self * appraisal and recognition of emotions in others * regulation of emotions, and * use of emotions. To the extent that EI includes the ability to manage emotions, it can be expected that it will have an influence on CWBs similar to that found for self-control. Research in this area is limited, however, one study looking for the moderating effects of EI on the relationships between distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice failed to find a significant moderating effect in any of these relationships. =Interpersonal conflict= Interpersonal conflict in the workplace can also lead to counterproductive work behaviors. Interpersonal conflict with the supervisor can lead to counterproductive work behaviors such as defiance, undermining, and colluding with coworkers to engage in deviant behavior. Interpersonal conflict with peers can lead to counterproductive work behaviors such as harassment, bullying, and physical altercations. =Organizational constraints= Organizational constraints, the extent to which conditions at work interfere with job tasks, has been shown to relate to CWB so that jobs with high constraints have employees who engage in CWB. Not only do constraints lead to CWB, but CWB can lead to constraints. Employees who engage in CWB can find that constraints increase over time. =Organizational justice= Organizational justice or fairness perceptions have been shown to influence the display of counterproductive work behaviors. Distributive justice, procedural justice, and interactional justice have all been shown to include both counterproductive work behaviors aimed at individuals, such as political deviance and personal aggression; and counterproductive work behaviors aimed at the organization, such as production slowdown and property deviance. Overall perceptions of unfairness may particularly elicit interpersonal counterproductive work behaviors such as political deviance and personal aggressions. Interpersonal justice and informational justice may also predict counterproductive work behaviors aimed at the supervisor, such as neglecting to follow supervisory instructions, acting rudely toward one's supervisor, spreading unconfirmed rumors about a supervisor, intentionally doing something to get one's supervisor in trouble, and encouraging coworkers to get back at one's supervisor. =Personality= Personality is a predictor of an employee's proclivity toward counterproductive work behaviors. With regard to the Big Five personality traits: conscientiousness, agreeableness, extroversion and openness to experience all predict counterproductive behaviors. When an employee is low in conscientiousness, counterproductive work behaviors related to the organization are more likely to occur. Employees who are low in agreeableness will exhibit counterproductive work behaviors related to interpersonal deviant behaviors. Furthermore, in terms of greater specificity, for employees low in conscientiousness, sabotage and withdrawal are more likely to occur. For employees low in extraversion, theft is likely to occur. Finally, for employees high in openness to experience, production deviance is likely to occur. Narcissisism Employees with narcissistic personalities tend to exhibit more counterproductive work behaviors, especially when the workplace is stressful. Psychopathy According to Boddy, because of abusive supervision by corporate psychopaths, large amounts of anti-corporate feeling will be generated among the employees of the organisations that corporate psychopaths work in. This should result in high levels of counterproductive behaviour as employees give vent to their anger with the corporation, which they perceive to be acting through its corporate psychopathic managers in a way that is eminently unfair to them.. Self- control Self-control has been evaluated as a significant explanation of CWBs. Like, conscientiousness, self-control, or internal control, is seen as a stable individual difference that tends to inhibit deviant behaviors. The identification of self-control as a factor in deviant behaviors flows from work in criminology, where self-control is seen as the strength of one's ability to avoid short-term gain for long-term costs. Using multiple regression analysis, one study compared the effects of 25 characteristics (including self-control, justicial factors, equity factors, positive affect, levels of autonomy, and a variety of other individual characteristics) on CWBs. The study showed that self-control was the best predictor of CWBs and that most of the other factors had negligible predictive value. Cognitive ability and age were among the remaining factors that showed some effect. These additional findings are consistent with research that tends to show older employees exercise a greater level of self-control. Target personality One line of research in CWBs looks not at the instigators of CWBs, but the victims' provocative target behavior, or the behaviors of the victims of CWBs, which are seen as potential mediating factors in the frequency and intensity of CWBs originated against them. This line of research suggests that low levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness, and high levels of neuroticism, in the victims of CWBs may lead to more incidents of CWBs, like incivility. The affective events theory has been used to explain that some individuals report being the victim of incivility more often because they are more sensitive to it than other workers.  Peer reporting  Normative behavior within organizations tends to discourage workers from reporting the observed CWBs of their peers, although this tendency can be reduced when a group is punished for the CWBs of individual members. There are three factors that seem to be most influential on peer reporting of CWBs: the emotional closeness between the person exhibiting the CWBs and the person observing the CWBs; the severity of the misconduct observed, and the presence of witness. Peers are more likely to report the CWBs of colleagues when the conduct is severe, or when there are other witnesses present, and less likely to report CWBs when they are emotionally close to the person committing the CWBs. A key problem in the use of peer reports of CWBs instead of self-reports of CWBs is that peer reports only capture observed behaviors and are not able to identify CWBs committed secretly.  Managing strategies A substantial body of research has demonstrated that stable characteristics of individuals are associated with the likelihood of CWBs. Some examples of stable characteristics that have been demonstrated to have relationships with CWBs include conscientiousness and agreeability, motivation avoidance, cognitive ability, and self-control. To the extent that these stable conditions predict CWBs, reduction of CWBs in an organization can begin at the recruitment and selection phase of new employees. Integrity screening is one common form of screening used by organizations as is cognitive ability screening. Personality testing is also common in screening out individuals who may have a higher incidence of CWBs. Work samples have been found to be a more effective screening tool than integrity testing alone, but integrity testing and cognitive testing together are even better screening tools. While the use of screening instruments may be an imperfect decision-making tool, the question often facing the recruitment officer is not whether the instrument is perfect, but whether, relative to other available screening tools, the screening tool is functional. However, organizations must do more than screen employees in order to successfully manage CWBs. Substantial research has demonstrated that CWBs arise out of situational factors that occur in the day-to-day operations of an organization, including organizational constraints, lack of rewards, illegitimate tasks, interpersonal conflicts, and lack of organizational justice. Research has shown that individuals who are treated unfairly are more likely to engage in CWBs. One major step that organizations can take to reduce the impetus for CWBs is therefore to enhance organizational justice. Maintaining communications and feedback, allowing participation of employees, and supervisory training are other suggestions for mitigating CWBs. Organizations must also pay close attention to employees for signs and sources of interpersonal conflicts so that they can be identified and tended to as necessary. Combating CWBs comes with some costs, including the costs of selection, monitoring, and implementing preventive measures to reduce triggers for CWBs. Before undertaking costly measures to reduce CWBs, it may be worthwhile for an organization to identify the costs of CWBs. If the cost- benefit analysis does not show a savings, then the organization must decide whether the battle against CWBs is worth fighting. There is at least one set of researchers that suggest that production deviance (withholding effort) and withdrawal can be a benefit to employees by allowing them to relieve tension in certain circumstances.

Rosario de Santa Fe, Argentina, 1901; d. Dorchester, England, 23 September 1978) was a British merchant seaman, Royal Navy officer, police officer, and author of over 100 books, including memoirs and books for children.Douglas V. Duff, Collecting Books and Magazines, accessed 25 April 2010.'Deaths', The Times, Tuesday, 26 September 1978; pg. 26; Issue 60416; col B. Douglas V. Duff Douglas was the eldest son of Arthur Joseph Duff, then British Consul in Rosario, and Florence Valder. Duff served in the Merchant Navy during World War I, and survived being torpedoed on two occasions. He later rescued White Russian refugees from the Black Sea, spent time as an apprentice monk, served as a 'Black and Tan' during the counter- insurgency in Ireland, and joined the Palestine Police. After further naval service in World War II, he became a successful broadcaster. Service in the Great War In 1914 Duff entered the naval training college HMS Conway aged 13 and served in the Merchant Navy in World War I. He served first on the freighter Thracia, and saw action using its deck gun against a German U-boat which was subsequently sunk by a French destroyer.Sword for Hire. The Saga of a Modern Free-Companion. John Murray, London. 1934. pp. 15-17 On 26 March 1917, the ship carrying a cargo of 4,000 tons of iron ore was sunk by a German U-boat. Midshipman Duff, aged 16, was the only survivor of a crew of 37.Sword for Hire. The Saga of a Modern Free-Companion. John Murray, London. 1934. pp. 17-24 Seventeen months later he was a member of the crew of the passenger ship Flavia carrying American nurses and Serbian cavalrymen serving in the American army. It was also torpedoed and sunk. Only one passenger was drowned but several hundred horses were lost. Duff had to kill several horses with his revolver in order to stop them swamping his lifeboat.Sword. p.29 Duff served on a third ship carrying American troops across the Atlantic which was wracked with Spanish flu that killed dozens of its passengers. Duff suffered a broken leg as a result of a U-boat attack. After the Armistice Duff took part in the rescue of White Russian refugees from the Black Sea and was appalled by the sight of destitute Russian noblewomen trading sexual favours with the crew in exchange for food and accommodation in their bunks. He referred to his experiences during this period as 'indescribable'. =Period in monastery= Whilst alone in the water following the sinking of the Thracia he promised to himself he would become a monk if he survived the ordeal. Following the end of World War I he entered a monastery near Spalding, Lincolnshire, as Brother Lawrence. However he became increasingly disillusioned by monastic life due to personality clashes with the senior monks and his revulsion at their brutal treatment of the novices.Sword.pp. 35,41,47 Service in the \\"Black and Tans\\" After two years in the monastery Duff left to serve as an auxiliary policeman in the famous counter-terrorism force the \\"Black and Tans\\" during the Irish War of Independence of 1920 to 1921. On enlistment Duff lied about his military background claiming to have served in the Rifle Brigade in order to spare himself an extended period of police training in depot. He was quickly involved in combat against the Irish Republican Army (IRA), and shot his way out of two ambushes, resulting in the deaths of a pair of insurgents who had attacked his unit with grenades. He later took part in a huge firefight involving up to an estimated hundred insurgents and police officers. The ambushers were driven off by the police using a machine gun-equipped armored car. Whilst off duty he claims to have confronted a man he suspected of being IRA leader Michael Collins in a Dublin street. The man indicated he was correct in his suspicions but alleged that several men lounging nearby were his armed bodyguards who would kill Duff if he attempted to take him prisoner. Not carrying his sidearm whilst off duty, Duff allowed the man to depart and reported his encounter to Dublin Castle intelligence.Sword. pp.79-80 By 1921 Duff was employed using his maritime training to lead small boat raids against groups of fugitive IRA members who had sought sanctuary in remote coastal villages inaccessible by road. At the time of the eventual truce Duff was relieving a small force of Royal Marines who were besieged in a lighthouse. Duff was horrified by the terms of the ceasefire as he considered the rebellion practically crushed and referred to the London government as a 'junta' for agreeing to it. In his autobiography Duff writes proudly of his police colleagues referring to them as 'some of the finest sons of Empire' and was ardent in his support for reprisals against the IRA and their supporters. Palestine Duff joined what was to become the Palestine Police Force in 1922. Morale was low amongst the many recruits who were veterans from World War I and the conflicts in Ireland and Russia. On the voyage from Britain to Palestine Duff became involved in a quasi-mutiny over pay and conditions aboard their transport ship. He reminded his commanding officer that many of the cadet constables possessed their own private weapons obtained during their wartime service and that he was perfectly capable of taking command of the vessel if need be. The newly formed gendarmerie was based at Sarafand. From Sarafand Duff was stationed in Nazareth before being moved to Haifa where he became a member of the Palestine Port Police. Their main task was intercepting smugglers of tobacco (Lattakia) and hashish. Duff commanded patrol boats on security duties and on one occasion went undercover in Beirut to entrap a drug smuggling ring. They also supervised the arrival of Zionist immigrants whose quarantine camp, beside the Kishon River, was harsh and many of the occupants contracted malaria.Sword,pp.103,109,119,123,132 He describes Haifa in 1923 as being like the \\"Wild West\\", \\"Many Englishmen lived openly with native women, some foolish enough to marry them.\\"Sword, 123 In 1926 he was promoted to Inspector based at the Police HQ on Mount Scopus. He had responsibility for policing Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The most important events of the year were Christmas Eve and Easter which involved the Eastern Orthodox Sabt an-Nur, (Day of Holy Fire) and the an-Nabi Musa Muslim celebrations.Sword. pp.157,188-98, 201-11 He was in Jerusalem on 11 July 1927 when Palestine was shaken by a severe earthquake that killed 150 people in the district. He describes the sound of people screaming coming from the Old City. He was sent to Jericho to assist with rescue attempts and then to Nablus to retrieve the dead.Sword. pp.219-217 He was at the centre of what became known as the Western Wall controversy in 1928, when following an order from the Chief Commissioner, Mr Keith Roach, his men removed a screen that worshippers had put up against the Wailing Wall.Horne, Edward (2003). A Job Well Done: A History of the Palestine Police Force, 1920-1948. Book Guild. . pp.80,124-129. During the inquiry into his actions he was transferred, as commander, to Megiddo Prison. His staff consisted of one Jewish deputy officer and 45 Arab policemen in charge of 500 convicts. He was in Meggido when the 1929 pogroms broke out and assisted the kibbutz of Mishmar Ha'Emek which came under attack from local Bedouin. It was at this time he first contracted malaria. From Megiddo he moved to the command of Acre Prison. In 1931 Duff became commander of Tulkarm district which was rife with feuds, highway robberies and attacks on Jewish colonies. According to his account he retired the following year due to severe recurrences of malaria.Sword. pp. 278,281, 289,296,333 Other sources say he was dismissed for the ill treatment of prisoners and that his name was the source of the slang expression \\"to duff up\\" someone.The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 9th Edition.Journal of Palestine Studies, VOL.

Set in spring 1937 he gives an account of a man-hunt with dogs across the Carmel hills which ended with the fugitive being shot dead and the houses he was seen running away from being blown up by the British Royal Engineers.Palestine Unveiled. Blackie & Son Ltd, Glasgow. 1938. pp.52-59 Travel of all civilian traffic around Galilee was in convoys led by British armoured cars. In Acre and Nablus he was advised not to enter the town alone. He was searched by the army at a checkpoint on the road from Bireh to Jerusalem. He had to wait for an army escort to take him round the city walls from the Damascus Gate to the Jaffa Gate. At night in the Old City there was the regular sound of gunfire. During the day the streets were patrolled by the army. He was only able to visit Bethlehem by joining and Army patrol which took him to Hebron and Beersheba returning via Bayt Jibrin. In Jerusalem he witnessed a bomb being thrown at a Jewish bus. The book is dominated by his spiritual journey which reaches its climax in the Holy Sepulchre.Unveiled. pp.239-42 Semi-retirement and writing career In 1932 Duff married nurse Janet Wallace, who had reputedly fended off an attack on her Nazareth hospital using only a broom. Plagued by recurring bouts of malaria, Duff left the police and set up home in Dorset, where he took up a career in journalism, drawing on his own experiences to write adventure stories for boys. In 1940 Peter Darington - seaman detective - appeared. There was also Harding of the Palestine Police (1941) and Bill Beringer - detective - (1949) who appeared in a long running series, as did Adam Macadam - Naval cadet - (1957). =Service in World War II= On the outbreak of the Second World War Duff joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), and served in Dover. He would later serve in the Middle East, including a period on the Staff of Admiral Cunningham and commanding blockade runners breaking the siege of Tobruk. In March 1941 he was awarded a Mention in Dispatches (MID) for his service aboard HM Yacht Eskimo off the Libyan coast, and eventually commanded patrol ship , netting the Suez Canalhttp://www.collectingbooksandmagazines.com/duff.html. In 1943 he returned to the UK, where he joined the Irregular Warfare Department of the Admiralty based in Teignmouth. He was demobilised in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant commander. =Post World War II career= Duff's first wife, Janet, died in 1960 and he later married Eveline Rowston, another nurse. He continued writing for the rest of his life and became a popular broadcaster on radio and television, and a regular panellist on the long running television show What's My Line?. He died in Dorchester in 1978 and was survived by his daughters Jean and Elizabeth. Books Duff produced nearly 100 books in his lifetime, sometimes writing under pseudonyms, including Douglas Stanhope, Leslie Savage and Peter Wickloe. His books were invariably based on his own life story and were normally a combination of nautical adventures and police/detective work featuring heroes such as Peter Harrington, Bill Berenger, Jack Harding and the Sea Whelps. In later years he would branch off into science fiction stories such as 'The Sky Pirates', 'The Man From Outer Space' and 'The Nuclear Castle'. He contributed to 'The Boys Own Paper' and 'The Wide World' magazine as well as historical works such as 'Nine Famous Stories of Sieges and Escapes' and 'The Story of the Merchant Navy' and non fiction such as 'Ships of the World'. He also produced three volumes of autobiography, Sword for Hire 1934, May the Winds Blow 1948 and Bailing with a Tea Spoon 1953. *Sword for Hire: The Saga of a Modern Free-Companion, John Murray, London, 1934 *Palestine Picture, Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1936 *Palestine Unveiled, Blackie & Son Ltd, Glasgow, 1938 =References= =Bibliography= * Horne, Edward, A Job Well Done: A History of the Palestine Police Force, 1920-1948.

He often performed with stage partner, Phatchance (aka Chance Waters) and later became his manager. Girgis co-founded a record label, I Forgot Sorry! in 2010 and then a management company, Be Like Children, in 2013.  Early life and education  Luke George Girgis was born on 20 August 1987 in Melbourne, his parents were second generation Egyptian migrants who raised him in Sydney's Sutherland Shire as a member of the Australian Coptic Orthodox church. As Coptic Soldier, he later recalled his first live band \\"A Year 12 rock band in the school hall when I was in Year 5. – Can’t remember their name...\\", from that performance he learnt \\"That no matter how bad your music is, you can always make a crowd laugh. Haha.\\" He attended St Patrick's College; he obtained a degree in Rehabilitation Counselling at the University of Sydney before completing a degree in Theology at Charles Sturt University.  Hip hop artist  Coptic Soldier was signed to Nurcha Records in 2005 before its closure in 2009. He remembered, in 2008, that he was \\"first introduced to hip hop by the likes of US bigwigs Eminem and Tupac, but has since drawn inspiration from artists closer to home.\\" His performance name acknowledges his heritage in the Coptic Christian faith and his \\"fighting for what you believe in.\\" He released his debut mix tape, False Start, on that label in 2006. InTheMix's Xpose described his work: \\"While this release isn't in the upper echelon of those currently coming out in this country, it definitely impressed me. Potential wise Coptic Soldier has a lot to offer, he is an emcee you want to hear more from as he speaks what is on many of our minds.\\" As from 2007 he ran an artist management company, The Girgis Circus, which catered for his fellow artists, including Phatchance aka Chance Waters. In 2010 Coptic Soldier teamed up with Sydney soul vocalist Miriam Waks and independently released an extended play, The Sound of Wings, which was produced by K21, an Adelaide-based hip hop artist. As a solo artist he independently distributed a release, The Past Three Years. He described it as \\"a street release that really reflects my life in the last three years... I write basically whatever is on my mind. Most recently I have been in huge reflection about my growth and fortune, so all the music I seem to be writing at the moment shows just that.\\" In March 2010 he joined Phatchance for a national tour, Inkstains, which saw the pair co-headline nine dates across Australia. He also provided management for other hip hop artists Mind over Matter and Elgen & Johnny Utah; and for a pop music artist, HR King. Also in that year he co-founded an independent record label, I Forget, Sorry!, together with Phatchance and Mind over Matter, to cater for the artists' releases. He explained his plans to Birdie of Beat magazine, \\"The biggest focus will be this acoustic tour for now but we do have a couple of other big things that we’ll work on after that. Chance is going to work on his album, which I’m excited about – that will hopefully be late this year or early next year. Then I'm going to be doing my album late next year too. For me the acoustic EP is a sequel to my debut EP [The Sound Of Wings] with Miriam Waks and a guy from Adelaide called K21 who won the Hilltop Hoods initiative.\\" During 2011 Coptic Soldier and Phatchance undertook a combined Hey Where's Your DJ tour, which Chris Singh of The AU Review caught, \\"When one thinks of live hip-hop, the usual picture in their head is that of at least one emcee rapping to the beats dropped by at least one DJ – a format often criticised by those outside of hip-hop. Every so often, a hip-hop act comes along and replaces the DJ with a backing band, not only giving their concert much more musical credibility, but allowing for more creative live interpretations of each of their songs... [the pair] decided to start experimenting with instrumental interpretations of their fine Aussie hip-hop tracks, national interest in these two emcees skyrocketed and their resulting acoustic EPs were met with more success than they hoped for.\\" In May of that year the pair appeared on Hip Hop Show on youth radio, Triple J; they were interviewed by the host, Hau Latukefu, who also played their tracks, \\"No More Waiting\\" (by Coptic Soldier featuring Phatchance) and \\"Liquid Company\\" (by Coptic Soldier, live in the studio). As Waters' manager, in 2012, he negotiated for that artist's album, Infinity, to appear on Shock Records. In May 2012 Coptic Soldier was performing solo shows through New South Wales to Coffs Harbour.  After Coptic Soldier  In 2013 Coptic Soldier worked under his name, Luke Girgis, to negotiate a deal for Waters with Island Records Australia, a subsidiary of the Universal Music Group. Due to Waters' tracks being listed in the 2012 Triple J Hottest 100, that artist also signed a publishing contract with Universal Music Publishing. In that year Girgis established an independent management company, Be Like Children, with the mission statement to be \\"always artist first\\". In 2014 Girgis was given funds from The Seed Arts Music Grant to attend a management workshop. He formed a performance duo, Run to Damascus, with Jon Reichardt to release a single, \\"Hide & Seek\\", via I Forget, Sorry! The track was mixed and executive produced by Waters. Also that year he and his business partner, Matt Cannings, became co-managers of Sydney- based pop rock act, Little Sea, and signed them to a deal with Sony Music Australia. They debuted at number 1 on the Australian iTunes music chart, before touring Australia as main support for international stars 5 Seconds of Summer. From 2014 to late 2016 he was the A&R; and label director for Shock Records. In 2015 Girgis oversaw the release of Little Sea's EP, With You Without You, featuring the single, \\"Change for Love\\", which peaked in the ARIA Singles Chart top 40. Early in 2017, after leaving Shock Records, he established Seventh Street Media with the acquisition of the privately owned music publications, Tone Deaf, The Brag and J Play.  Personal life  Girgis lives in Sydney with his wife Christine and their child. He is an active Christian and provided his opinion on the Australian same-sex marriage postal survey conducted in 2017.

Built about 1720, it is believed to be the oldest standing house in the town. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 1, 1979. Description and history The Sarah Whitman Hooker House is located in southern West Hartford, on the south side of New Britain Avenue (Connecticut Route 71), just east of its junction with South Main Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with two interior chimneys and a centered entrance. It is set at the busy southeast corner of New Britain Avenue and South Main Street. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows and framed by a molded surround. The house was built c. 1720, and originally had a central chimney. It was built by John Seymour in what was one of the first areas of Hartford' West Parish to be settled. It underwent a major renovation in the early 19th century, at which time that chimney was removed, and the attic and rear leanto spaces were rebuilt. The interior suffered fire damage in 1935, but this has since been restored. In addition to its age, the house is notable locally for its role in the American Revolutionary War, when the house was owned by Thomas Hart Hooker, a descendant of Hartford's founder Thomas Hooker, and his wife Sarah Whitman Hooker.

Description and history The Spanish House is located in a residential area of eastern West Hartford, on the northwest side of a bend in Fernwood Road east of Steele Road. It is a U-shaped 1-1/2 story structure, with the legs running north-south and enclosing a courtyard that is open at the southern end. The walls are masonry finished in stucco, and the roof is red tile. Wrought iron elements accent the exterior, and portions of the interior have painted landscapes and abstract patterns executed by N. Ross Parke, a Hartford artist. A two-car garage, integral to the structure, projects north from the eastern leg of the U, and is accessed via a semicircular drive on the east side of the property. The house was designed by the Hartford architect Lester Scheide in consultation with his patron, Grace M. Spear Lincoln, a Hartford native who had lived in Spain. The Spanish architectural style exhibited by the house is unique to the period for central Connecticut. The house was built in 1928, Fernwood Road having been platted for development in 1925. Interior floor tiles and fountains were imported from Spain. The entire history of the house's design and construction is documented through sketches, plans, and bills.

Marko Car (; 30 August 1859 – 1 December 1953) was a Serbian writer, politician and activist from the Bay of Kotor. He was a polyglot and an aesthetic essayist, writing numerous poems, novels, narratives, essays, and travel reports. During his lifetime, he wrote for many newspapers and magazines.  Biography  Marko Car was born in 1859 in the town of Herceg-Novi in the Bay of Kotor, then a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia province of the Austrian Empire. He received his basic education in the local Italian popular school, after which he moved to Kotor and finished the classical gymnasium. Then he moved to the province's capital of Zadar in 1879, entering political life by joining the Serb People's Party (Dalmatia) of Sava Bjelanović (whose biography he later wrote and published in Dubrovnik's Serb Press in 1911) which fought for the defense of national interests of the Serb people in the wake of the Croatian nationalistic movement. He worked in the Dalmatian Diet from 1884 to 1918. His friends and colleagues were Luko Zore, Antun Fabris, Pero Budmani, Medo Pucić, Niko Pucić, Ivan Stojanović, and other members of the Serb-Catholic circle. He was the editor of the Zadar magazine called Vuk (The Wolf), one of the most influential periodicals, that was being published in 1884. Though short-lived, Vuk provoked and stimulated numerous debates among Croatian, Italian and Serbian intellectuals in Dalmatia on the literary, artistic and social life of the time. Jovan Dučić in his 1898 article on Serbian writers, hailed Marko Car's travel writing, insisting on the possibility of a synthesis between the two types of travel writing dominant in the nineteenth century, the romantic travelogue marked by one's personality, and the scientific, positivist travelogue. When the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was created, Car moved to the new monarchy's capital of Belgrade in 1919. The mid-war period he had spent working for the Yugoslavian Ministry of Education as the Inspector of the Artist division until retirement in 1921. Car is the founder of the Society of Serbian Writers in Belgrade, being its first President. He then received his membership in the Serbian Royal Academy, later known as the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts, and also membership in the Matica srpska in Novi Sad. He was also for one time a President of the Serbian Literary Community. After the April war and the Nazi occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1941, he fled to Italy across Zadar. After the war ended and the Communist Partisans won in 1945, he returned to Belgrade where he spent the rest of his life. He became famous as a writer for his work in 1883 entitled Za kišljive dnevi (During the Rainy Days). He worked for the Matica srpska in Dubrovnik in 1910, the year he published \\"Naše Primorije,\\" printed by the Serbian Dubrovnik Printing Press. He died on 1 December 1953 in the Yugoslav and Serbian capital of Belgrade, in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. His remains were moved to Montenegro to the countryside of his birth and he was buried in the Savina Monastery, according to his own wishes. He was a polyglot, translating from Italian and French into Serbo-Croatian. This is evident with Serbian writers (Marko Car, Lujo Vojnović, Matija Ban, Stjepan Mitrov Ljubiša and others, born and raised in nineteenth century Dalmatia or Montenegro) who were well acquainted with the Italian language and Italian literature. Car collaborated closely with Svetomir Nikolajević.  Religious and national beliefs  Although born a Roman Catholic Christian, he converted before death to Eastern Orthodoxy, claiming that that was the only way to save the Catholic-Serb community from extinction and avoid assimilation into Croats, which he had claimed was occurring in the Bocca. His movement didn't have significant impact outside his native Dalmatian coastland, but in there a significant number of Catholics converted to Orthodox Christians considering it a confirmation of their Serbian national identity and affiliation.  Legacy  A street in Herceg Novi's Old City bears his name in his honor. In it is also a bust raised in his honor by sculptor Petar Palavicini (also spelled Palaviccini) not long after Car's death.  Quotes  Marko Car on Boka kotorska, in the \\"Niz rodno Primorje\\" (Slike i utisci s Jadrana, Mostar, 1899): (And so, in addition to all the noble qualities that are already in our blood, our people are being educated in another Serb, some peculiar physical and psychological form, which separates him from the rest of his brothers and which he must have in those brothers. It is surprising ... Many suspect the Serbian blood of Boka. But this melancholy wondering does not last long, as soon as each of them gushes with a gnarly native who originates from Kosovo and includes in his yarns Strahinja Ban and Marko Kraljević ... The main town in Boka Kotorska by its old designation and official design is the town of Kotor. But it is a moral capital, not to mention Herceg-Novi. I do not discount the value of Kotor and the rest of Boka with this, but, of course. The new is where it gets the best itch and where the alien has so far been the least embedded.)

Background Aper Aku was born in 1938 in Ikyobo, Ushongo Local Government Area, Benue State. He was of Tiv origin. He had his primary education at Aku Primary School between 1943-1947 and from 1948 to 1951, he attended the Senior Primary School, Mkar.http://www.aperaku.org/ He had his senior secondary education at Government College, Keffi from 1952 to 1957, and then studied at Nigeria College of Arts and Science (later Ahmadu Bello University) from 1958 to 1961. He studied for a degree at Fourah Bay University, Sierra Leone (1961–1964). He became a teacher in 1964 at William Bristow Secondary School, Gboko, and later taught at Bauchi Provincial Secondary School and Government Secondary School, Gombe. He attended Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria (1965–1966) for a post- graduate Course in Education. In 1968 he joined the Federal Government and worked with External Aid for Education and the Federal Ministry of Establishment. He was Principal of the Federal Training Centre, Kaduna (1970–1972) and a member of the Governing Council of the University of Ibadan (1972–1976). In May 1974 and again in August 1974 Aku wrote to Joseph Dechi Gomwalk, Governor of Benue-Plateau State, accusing him of nepotism and financial wrongdoings, and filed affidavits to this effect. General Yakubu Gowon dismissed the allegations at the time and ordered Aku's detention. However, a probe initiated by Gowon's successor Murtala Mohammed vindicated Aku, saying that the allegations were true. Political career Aper Aku was appointed as Chairman of Kwande Local Government Council in 1977 by Abdullahi Shelleng, Benue state governor. He presided over a hostile council because the councillors belonged to different factions; some councillors where loyal to Joseph Tarka, Akus mentor and some were loyal to Paul Unongo, a leader of another political camp. However, his administration was perceived as honest and effective.Jibo, M. (1993). Tiv politics since 1959. Katsina Ala, Benue State: Mandate International Limited. P. 66-67 Aku resigned as chairman of the local council in 1978 and subsequently entered the Benue State primary race for governor under the banner of the National Party of Nigeria (NPN). He won the NPN primary over challengers such as Isaac Shaahu and George Atedze. In 1979, he went on to become the elected Governor of Benue State and was re- elected in 1983. Aku faced severe problems as governor in a state with a long history of neglect, particularly in the southern area which was inhabited by minority groups. However, the state has fertile land and plentiful rainfall, with great agricultural potential. Aku encouraged mass agricultural production, and during his tenure the state produced bumper harvests of local crops such as yams, cassava, soya beans, cowpea, maize, guinea corn, millet, groundnut, banana, mangoes and oranges. The Government established a number of industries to produce fertilizer and process agricultural products, located close to the areas where the produce was grown. Aku launched commercial enterprises such as the Benue Brewery, Benro Packaging, Benue Bottling Company, Lobi Bank, Ber-Agbum Fish Farm, Ikogen Cattle Ranch, Taraku Vegetable Processing Industry and Benue International Hotel in Makurdi. He initiated the Makurdi International Market and planned to establish a flour mill in Makurdi. Aku also built a state of the art State Secretariat He cancelled work on a large medical centre at Apir and instead began construction of seven cottage hospitals in different locations. He established two Teachers Colleges at Oju and Makurdi and the University of Technology in Makurdi. He embarked on an ambitious program to expand the number of Secondary Schools. He built roads in Makurdi township and provided the street lights, awarded the contract for the Art Council Complex and started work on the Makurdi stadium. Last years On 31 December 1983 General Muhammadu Buhari took power in a coup, and replaced the civilian governors with military officers. When Aku was removed from office the state's finances were severely overdrawn. Many of the projects he had begun were later abandoned by the later military governors, and agricultural production plunged. The elaborate water supply schemes that Aku had initiated was abandoned, and the infrastructure that had been built was not maintained. To this day, the Late Governor Aper Aku is regarded as the best governor to ever govern Benue State. Professor David Iornem once referred to him as a visionary leader ahead of his time. Buhari jailed Aku and most of the other Governors, setting up military tribunals to investigate their conduct while in office. Aku's health was broken by the harsh conditions in jail, and he died in 1988 shortly after being released. Aku left two wives and four children. At a 2008 press conference to mark the anniversary of his death, the People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader in the state noted that 70% of important projects in Benue State today were started or completed during the four years of the Aku administration.

Built about 1764, it is one of the town's few surviving 18th-century buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on September 10, 1986. Description and history The Whitman House is located north of West Hartford center, on the east side of North Main Street, a short way south of its junction with Clifford Lane. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a large central chimney, gabled roof, and clapboarded exterior on a brownstone foundation. A rear leanto section gives it a saltbox appearance. The main facade is six bays wide, with asymmetrical window placement. The main entrance is off-center, and is a wide two-leaf entry flanked by fluted pilasters and topped by a corniced entablature. The interior retains a number of original period features, includes raised paneling and wainscoting. The original five-bay section of the house was built c. 1764 by John Whitman, Jr., possibly on the site of an older 17th-century house. Whitman was a prominent landowner who was involved in petitions to separate West Hartford from Hartford, and was the brother of Sarah Whitman Hooker, whose house also still stands. The house was widened about 1813, and underwent a major architect-led rehabilitation in 1913. A prominent early 20th-century resident was Frederick Duffy, a dairy farmer who introduced milking machines and the storage of grain in silos to the area.

The last major train robbery in the United States, the two have been referred to as \\"the last of America's classic train robbers\\". Though they were not professional criminals, their unhealthy fixation with the American Wild West prompted them to rob the train which resulted in the intentional wounding of one passenger and the accidental death of another. History Henry Loftus (or Lorenz) was born and raised in Manitowoc, Wisconsin to German immigrant Conrad Lorenz. As a bored teenager living in a small town, Loftus developed an interest in dime novels and the American Old West. This interest eventually evolved into what his family later called a \\"Wild West complex\\" though they humored him hoping he would outgrow it. Loftus was still living at home when he committed his first arrest for burglary. The local town judge sympathized with the young man, suspended his sentence and released him on probation.Newton, Michael. The Encyclopedia of Robberies, Heists, and Capers. New York: Facts On File Inc., 2002. (pg. 179-180) Shortly afterwards, Loftus' father moved the family to Chicago where he opened a shoe store in 1936. Loftus stayed for only a few months and, after living in Brooklyn, New York for a time, announced that he was going west \\"to seek fame and fortune in the wide open spaces\\". His companion on this journey was Harry Donaldson (or Dwyer), a young Canadian he had recently befriended, who had a similar interest in the Wild West and its outlaws in particular. A year later, they booked a train on the Santa Fe Railroad to El Paso, Texas. Upon their arrival, they were disappointed to see that El Paso had long since left behind its frontier past and had become a modern city with paved streets and automobiles much like they left behind in Chicago. While in El Paso, they purchased cowboy outfits, including chaps and Ten-gallon hats, and soon found themselves a source of amusement to the local residents. Loftus and Donaldson eventually decided to leave the city by purchasing two horses and heading westward hoping to find something left of the American frontier.\\"Youth's, Held In Slaying, Find Story Books Were Wrong\\". Pittsburgh Press. 13 December 1937. After two days on the trail, they arrived at Deming, New Mexico. Confronted with the fact that the frontier no longer existed in the American Southwest, the two formed a plan to rob a train. Selling their horses, they used the money to buy old fashioned six-shooters with hand-tooled holsters and the rest for train tickets back to El Paso. On November 24, 1937, Loftus and Donaldson were travelling as passengers on the Southern Pacific Railroad's westbound Apache Limited out of El Paso. About an hour into the trip, Loftus sat up from their seat and drew his pistol on conductor W.M. Holloway. Holloway later recalled that he \\"thought [Loftus] was drunk. I didn't think it was a holdup. I was afraid that gun was going off when the amateur's hands started shaking\\". Regardless, Loftus covered the conductor while Donaldson moved through the passengers collecting several men's watches but no cash. Growing frustrated and nervous, a male passenger made a sudden move causing Donaldson to panic and shot the man in the hip. When Loftus went back to help his partner, he was tackled by an off-duty brakeman, W.L. Smith, who was travelling as a passenger. Loftus and Smith began wrestling on the floor when the gun suddenly went off killing Smith. At this point, the 20 passengers attacked both men \\"punching and kicking them in a frenzy\\". One witness said \\"If it hadn't been that we had women passengers on the coach, these robbers would have been beaten to death\\".

Sarasota Herald. 21 Dec 1937. Concerns arose that the two were unfit for trial as then District Attorney Martin Threet had to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. His father and sister travelled from Chicago to see Loftus, who read passages from the Bible given to him by his father, and his sister Margaret told the press that Loftus \\"does not seem to grasp the meaning of the charges against him\\". Neither had funds to help Loftus but said they would return for the trial if they were able. Donaldson's mother, a Mrs. Joseph Thibault, traveled all the way from Concession, Nova Scotia after using his last 95 cents to telegraph her. Facing the death penalty, they pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and were sentenced to serve 50–75 years imprisonment in February 1938.\\"Train Robbers Sentenced; Two Youths Get 50 to 75 Years for Death in Hold-Up\\". New York Times. 21 Feb 1938. Both men were charged and swiftly convicted of robbery and murder, however the circumstances of the crime received national attention. It was the last major train robbery in the United States, the two being referred to as \\"the last of America's classic train robbers\\", and officially ended the Old West-style train robbery started by the Reno Brothers 70 years before.

On 5 December 1987 the ship caught fire off the coast of Galicia, Spain. 23 of the 31 crew died, including the captain. The ship grounded off Cape Finisterre and broke up. Fire and wreck Cason was en route from Rotterdam to Shanghai with a cargo of various chemicals loaded at Hamburg, Rotterdam and Antwerp. The ship was owned by a Hong Kong company and registered in Panama. Of the 31 crew, the captain and chief engineer were from Hong Kong and the remainder Chinese. Shortly before dawn on 5 December 1987 an explosion occurred 23 miles off the Spanish coast at Cape Finisterre, setting the ship on fire. The captain broadcast an SOS about an hour later, and those crew not caught by the flames jumped into the sea to escape. All but eight died, including the captain and one woman. The ship grounded on rocks 150 metres (450 feet) offshore, still burning, and broke up. Initial reports were that the deaths were mainly from drowning and hypothermia; the local hospital later reported that one drowned but the remainder died of carbon monoxide poisoning. Survivors said that the lifeboat mechanism failed to work, as a result of which many crew members jumped into the water wearing lifejackets. The initial explosion was said to have been caused by the cargo shifting in heavy seas. Rescue operation and aftermath The Finisterre Red Cross launch and helicopters from the local air rescue service, the Spanish Navy, and Madrid were all involved in recovering bodies and searching for survivors. In addition British, Italian, and Danish ships rescued some survivors. One crew member who remained missing until the search was suspended at nightfall was found dead the next day. The weather remained stormy, complicating efforts to tow the ship; in the evening it ran aground on Punta do Rostro, an offshore shoal. The bottom of the ship was holed such that it was not feasible to refloat it. Because of the presumed risk of further explosion, tugboats and cranes were then ordered to remain clear. After it was determined that the cargo included inflammable gas, inflammable liquids and a poison, three tugboats and two specialised cranes on floating platforms were assembled to attempt recovery and precise identification of the cargo. Cargo recovery began on the afternoon of 9 December, with drums of ortho-cresol and formaldehyde, but the weather became stormy again, stopping the work and causing more drums containing sodium to break and catch fire, some of them after being washed overboard. No evacuation of residents of the coastal area was initially ordered, but hundreds left, especially after the weather worsened, and after further explosions in the hold beginning on 10 December caused a toxic cloud,According to Madiedo, the former Director General of the Spanish Merchant Marine, there was no toxic cloud: thousands fled and school buses were provided as transportation. Ultimately 15,000 or 20,000 people evacuated. The cargo included approximately 5,000 barrels, other containers, and bags containing inflammable substances (xylene, butanol, butyl acrylate, cyclohexanone, and sodium—contact of the sodium with water was the cause of the fire), toxins (aniline oil, diphenylmethane di-isocyanate, o-cresol, and dibutyl phthalate), and corrosives (phosphoric acid and phthalic anhydride).For a full list, see Madiedo, p. 306; see also The inflammable liquids comprised at least 2,000 barrels stored in four of the five hold compartments. The nature of the cargo was initially unclear, but the Spanish newspaper El País identified it as \\"several tons of a sodium compound, 110 tons of aniline oil, 6 tons of ethanol (grain alcohol) and 10 tons of an inflammable liquid of Grade 9 (maximum) danger\\", and the governor of A Coruña, Andres Moreno Aguilar, confirmed the list as accurate. There were rumours of nuclear material.Madiedo, \\"fabulaciones\\". Recovery of the dangerous substances that had not been swept into the sea by waves was completed on 12 December, after a deck was removed to access the deep tank where the aniline was stored. There were three injuries and one case of mild aniline poisoning among the salvage workers.Madiedo, p. 309. A large portion of the cargo was not recovered; what was, was taken to the Alúmina-Aluminio plant in San Cibrao, causing alarm among the workers. It was the worst sea disaster in the region since the Norwegian tanker ran aground near Vigo in 1970, also killing 23 crew members, and was studied in 2014 by the Polytechnic University of Catalonia as one of the worst chemical disasters of the 20th century in Spain. The accident demonstrated the need for adequate packing of sodium when being shipped, and also the inadvisability of using trade names for chemicals, which led to confusion. An anchor from Cason has been preserved on the quay at Fisterra with a memorial plaque.

The discovery of these breaches in 2010 by the NRL resulted in it stripping the Storm of all honours achieved as a team between 2006 and 2010. This included the 2007 and 2009 premierships and 2006, 2007 and 2008 minor premierships. Melbourne also had its 2010 World Club Challenge title revoked, more than one year since the initial penalties were first announced. Investigation Following claims by a whistleblower that the club was keeping a second set of books, the NRL conducted an investigation in late 2009 and early 2010. After initially denying the claims, Storm officials confessed on 22 April 2010 that the club had committed serious and systematic breaches of the salary cap for the last five years by running a well-organized dual contract and bookkeeping system which left the NRL ignorant of $3.78 million in payments made to players outside of the salary cap, including $303,000 in 2006, $459,000 in 2007, $957,000 in 2008, $1.021 million in 2009 and $1.04 million in 2010. As a club's compliance with the NRL salary cap is supported by statutory declarations, the club's owners requested that fraud and perjury charges be laid against those responsible and stated that any person who knew of the breach would be expelled from the club. The Victorian Fraud Squad began preliminary investigations on 23 April, and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission also made preliminary investigations and indicated an interest in investigating breaches of the Corporations Act. Storm executives had arranged for inflated invoices to be submitted to hide the payments to players. This involved submitting invoices of up to $20,000 above the real value of the services rendered with this amount paid directly to players by the third party suppliers, although there was no suggestion that the suppliers were involved in submitting the inflated invoices. As a result, NRL Chief Executive David Gallop stripped the Melbourne Storm of their 2007 and 2009 premierships and their 2006, 2007 and 2008 minor premierships, fined them an Australian sporting record $1,689,000 ($1.1 million in NRL prize money which was re-distributed equally between the remaining 15 clubs, $89,000 in prize money from the World Club Challenge which was re-distributed to the Leeds Rhinos, and the maximum of $500,000 for breaching the salary cap), deducted all eight premiership points they had already received in the 2010 season and barred them from receiving any more premiership points (including points automatically awarded for a bye during the season) for the rest of the 2010 season. The Storm initially accepted this decision without question but later appealed the loss of their two premierships and premiership points for the 2010 season. The court action was later dropped with the Storm paying the NRL's legal costs.Storm legal action collapses The Storm were also ordered to cut their payroll by $1,012,500 to meet the 2011 salary cap by 31 December 2010;NRL Fixtures – NRL Draw – NRL.com Storm ordered to cut over $1m from payroll failure to do so would have resulted in the club being suspended from the 2011 NRL season. On 23 April the NRL seized a secret dossier hidden in the home of acting chief executive Matt Hanson. The dossier contains letters of offer to three of the Storm's star players (Greg Inglis, Billy Slater, and Cameron Smith) and another unnamed player guaranteeing illegal payments in the form of goods from third parties. For one player with a $400,000 contract lodged with the NRL, the letter of offer was valued at $950,000, and contained a $20,000 gift voucher for a national retailer and a $30,000 boat. Other offers included a new car for a player's partner and $30,000 in home renovations. The offers together amounted to $700,000 of which the four players had already received $400,000. While Waldron had signed all the letters of offer only Inglis and Slater had signed theirs, albeit the letters were written in a way that the players may not have realised the extra payments were outside the cap. Suspects Former CEO Brian Waldron, suspended chief executive officer and former chief financial officer Matt Hanson and current chief financial officer Paul Gregory are alleged to have been the main culprits behind the breaches. Former chief financial officer Cameron Vale, who is now with the Australian Baseball League (ABL), was said to have been the whistleblower on the situation, a claim he denies. On 23 April 2010 Brian Waldron resigned from his position of chief executive of the Melbourne Rebels rugby union club after just six weeks of taking over the expansion team entering the new Super Rugby competition. The AFL investigated, and cleared, the St Kilda Football Club's players' payments during Waldron's three-year time at the club alongside now-former Storm CEO Matt Hanson. Reaction The news was referred to by The Age newspaper as \\"The biggest scandal in Australian sports history\\". Club supporters had mixed reactions and feelings towards the situation as the club was left with \\"dishonour and shame\\". No club had ever been stripped of a competition title in 102 years of professional rugby league in Australia. One fan dumped his jerseys and other memorabilia at the team's Carlton headquarters on hearing about the incident, while others simply broke into tears. There was a general feeling that former CEO Brian Waldron was to blame for the entire scandal and not the players. Then-Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who is the club's number one female ticket holder, said that supporters would be shocked and saddened, but hoped that they would stand by the club as it rebuilt. Storm chairman Dr. Rob Moodie apologised to the fans, many of whom publicly removed their Storm colours and dumped them in disgust. Several sponsors, most notably ME Bank, Hostplus and Skins immediately withdrew support from the club while Harvey Norman, Jayco, Suzuki and KooGa continued their support, with their logos featuring prominently in a hastily reconfigured jersey. In contrast to those sponsors who distanced themselves, Jayco and Suzuki increased their existing support to compensate for the losses of other sponsors. Betting agencies received an \\"old fashioned betting sting\\" as some punters found out about the salary cap allegations before they became common knowledge. At the time, the Storm were inside the top four of the NRL ladder with four wins and two losses, $4.20 favourites to win the title and $251 to win the wooden spoon. TAB Sportsbet has claimed it will be due to pay out at least $500,000 before betting was suspended. Melbourne sports industry experts John Poulakakis (Chief commercial officer, Melbourne F.C.) and Martin Hirons (Melbourne sport business consultant) were reported in The Age, saying it could take little more than four weeks to two months to recover the $2 million it is believed to have already lost in sponsorship. By 30 April the Age was reporting a surge in club membership of 700 over the five days since the scandal erupted, with members who had previously revoked their memberships contacting the club to have them reinstated. Aftermath The matter was referred to ASIC and the Victoria Police on 15 July.Storm salary cap rort report handed to police The matter was also referred to the Australian Tax Office and the Victorian State Revenue Office the next day. Despite having to play out the remainder of season for no points, Melbourne remained competitive in 2010, and continued to win games, finishing with a record of 14 wins (ten of which came after the salary cap breach was revealed) and 10 losses. Had they been allowed to play for points, they would have finished equal 5th. Their final game of the 2010 home and away season was a 34-4 win over the Newcastle Knights. On 6 May 2011 the Victoria Police concluded its fraud investigation into the matter saying that \\"It can no longer expend further resources on this matter\\" and that \\"No fraud has been committed\\".http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/melbourne-storm-executives-wont- be-charged-with-fraud-related-offences/story-e6frf9if-1226051106194 On 11 May 2011, the National Rugby League released its report on the breaches. The report did not detail any new breaches or any new penalties, however, it was recommended that Melbourne's 2010 World Club challenge be revoked. It also confirmed the guilty parties and vindicated all players and coaches.http://www.nrl.com/final-report-storm-salary-cap- investigation/tabid/10874/newsid/62723/default.aspx Melbourne remained successful in the years following the discovery of the breach.

In 2017 they again finished on top of the ladder, but this time went onto to win its third legitimate premiership, defeating the North Queensland Cowboys by 34-6 in the Grand Final. Also in 2017, Melbourne held a gala dinner for the 10 year reunion of the 2007 premiership side who were stripped of the title. Coach Craig Bellamy spoke to the media saying \\"They can say what they like and erase what they like, but they are not going to erase these guys memories of what they did in 2007\\".https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/melbourne-storm-coach-craig-bellamy- stands-firm-over-2007-grand-final- result-20170728-gxko7m.htmlhttps://wwos.nine.com.au/2017/07/28/16/35/tony- jones-melbourne-storm-mark-10-years-since-2007-nrl-grand-final-win In 2018, they won their third World Cup challenge title, again beating Leeds Rhinos. In 2016, the Parramatta Eels were also caught breaching the salary cap. It was revealed in March that third-party payments had been made by several companies to several players, which is strictly prohibited in the NRL. The main point of difference between the two episodes was the manner of the punishment: while the Melbourne Storm were not allowed to play for points for the remainder of the season, the Parramatta Eels were permitted to play for points as soon as they fell back in line with the cap. It was acknowledged that this change was made due to the demoralising nature of the Storm punishment, including fans having to witness a team running out week after week with nothing to play for. In 2018, the team the Storm beat in the 2007 grand final, the Manly Sea Eagles, were caught breaching the salary cap over a period of years in 2018. The Eagles were fined $750,000, but had no points deducted.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-26/nrl-fines-manly-sea- eagles-750000-for-salary-cap-breaches/9587044 In July 2018, Melbourne player Billy Slater spoke to the media about his possible retirement, and midway through the discussion said \\"I've been fortunate to play in many grand finals. I've won four and that won't determine whether I go on next year\\". Slater's statement, while accurate, does not reflect the fact that two of the premierships he won were later stripped by the NRL.https://www.smh.com.au/sport/nrl/billy-slater-says-decision-still-up-in- the-air-about-retirement-20180724-p4ztbz.html In March 2019, Melbourne player Cameron Smith called for a new investigation to be conducted with the potential for both the 2007 and 2009 stripped premierships to be reinstated. Smith was upset at the fact that the Cronulla Sharks were allowed to keep their 2016 premiership despite being over the salary cap between 2013 and 2017 to a total of $700,000. Even though the amount that Cronulla were over the cap was a lot less than the Melbourne salary cap breaches which was $3.7 million, Smith felt that Melbourne had been hard done by. In the week that followed, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg ruled out the possibility of the 2007 and 2009 stripped premierships being reinstated. On 1 August 2019, Cameron Smith spoke to Matthew Johns in an interview about the club's stripped premierships and how Smith said those premierships victories were still considered valid to him. Smith said to Johns \\"You’ve got different opinions ... they are ours, We’ve still got the memories, we’ve all got the rings, I get it, people will say ‘how can you think like that?’ but that's just the way it is\\".

He bequeathed a large part of his estate to the founding of Donaldson's Hospital. Early life Donaldson was born near the Mercat CrossEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1773 in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1751. His father, Alexander Donaldson (1727–1794), was the founding publisher of the Edinburgh Advertiser, but was perhaps better known as a bookseller and litigant, most notably Donaldson v Beckett, during the era known as the Battle of the booksellers. His mother was Anna Marshall, a merchant's daughter. He had younger brothers, but all died young. His paternal grandparents were James Donaldson (died 1754), a textile manufacturer, and Treasurer of Edinburgh; and Elizabeth Weir (died 1768). He had an uncle, John Donaldson, a London bookseller and partner of his father who was also an appellant in Donaldson v Beckett. Career At age 22, Donaldson became the second publisher of the Tory biweekly newspaper the Edinburgh Advertiser, the paper having been turned over to him by his father. His printing house was located at Castlehill. His apprentices and apprentice compositors included William Wilson, James Campbell, William Begg, Robert Miller, and James Thomson. In 1820, Donaldson sold the paper to Claud Muirhead, son of James Muirhead, the paper's principal manager and superintendent. Donaldson was a member of the Edinburgh Bookseller's Society. In 1782, like his father, he became a Burgess and Guild Brother of Edinburgh.

Donaldson died at Broughton Hall in 1830. Shortly after his death, Broughton Hall's attached garden was converted into zoological gardens. He bequeathed £220,000 of his estate for the foundation of Donaldson's Hospital to maintain and educate poor children, with a preference for those named Donaldson or Marshall.

Colin McCool, who played alongside Biddulph on the Somerset side of the late 1950s, was not complimentary about Biddulph's abilities as an opening bowler in his ghosted book Cricket is a Game (1960), though Biddulph took a total of 162 wickets over the 1959 and 1960 seasons. Cricket career Having played for the Somerset second eleven in 1954, Biddulph made his first-class debut in two matches during the 1955 season, taking three wickets in his first match against Worcestershire. There were seven first-class matches in 1956 and three in 1957. In the match against Derbyshire at Derby in 1956, he took five wickets for 46 runs in Derbyshire's first innings, finishing the innings off with a spell of five for 8 with the second new ball. Biddulph gained a more regular place in the first team in 1958 as the deputy for regular fast-medium bowler Bryan Lobb, playing in almost half the matches as Somerset finished third in the County Championship, the county's highest position since 1892. In his first match of the season, against Kent at Dartford, he took six second-innings wickets for 64 runs, his best career performance to that date. He improved that performance later in the season in the home match against Worcestershire at Taunton, when he and Bill Alley took all the wickets as Worcestershire were dismissed for 68; Biddulph's share was six for 34. Lobb retired from regular first-class cricket at the end of the 1958 season to become a teacher, and Biddulph stepped up in 1959 to be Somerset's regular opening bowler, usually forming a not-much-more- than-medium-paced opening attack with Alley or Ken Palmer. He took 79 wickets at an average of 24.35 and was awarded his county cap. He took five or more wickets in an innings four times and improved his own personal best with six for 30 in the match against the Combined Services at Taunton, and these were the best figures of his entire career. His figures for the 1960 season were similar: 83 wickets at an average of 27.28. In its review of Somerset's 1960 season, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that lack of a match winning fast bowler was the main cause for the team's poor performance: \\"Biddulph, Palmer, and Alley bowled accurately enough, but their medium-fast deliveries lacked penetrative power,\\" it wrote. In the 1961 season, Palmer's bowling became much more successful, but Biddulph, by contrast, lost form. He dropped out of the first team halfway through the season and at the end the season, he was not re-engaged. In an article after Biddulph's death, the cricket author Stephen Chalke wrote: \\"[His] moment on the stage had passed... Ken Biddulph quickly realized when his contract was not renewed in 1961. 'The sports shop in Taunton had a cut-out of me in the window, bowling. And the next time I walked past, it had gone.'\\" After Somerset Biddulph went into League cricket on leaving Somerset and was a regular in Durham's Minor Counties side from 1962 until 1969, reappearing in four matches during 1972. In this period, he played five List A matches for Durham in the Gillette Cup competition. Biddulph joined the staff at Wycliffe College in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire as the Cricket and Squash professional in 1985. He retired at the age of 60 in 1992,Wycliffe Star, July 1992 but he was active in cricket coaching in the West Country almost up to his death.

Macari's Ltd, who also own the Sola Sound Brand, and who have built and sold the pedals since 1965 now own the Tone Bender trademark. Intellectual Property Office - Tone Bender trademark Korg used to own Tone Bender trademarks in the 1990s. United States Patent and Trademark Office - Tone Bender United States Patent and Trademark Office - Tone Bender Germanium Charged Fuzz  Sola Sound Tone Bender MKI  The first incarnation of the Tone Bender was a three transistor circuit based on the Gibson Maestro Fuzz-Tone. Pedal Porn - A little History Gary Hurst, a technician, began selling these in mid-1965. By September he was selling them through the Macari brothers' Musical Exchange shops.Beat Instrumental No.29; September 1965 Early incarnations were housed in wooden enclosures. Later on folded steel enclosures were used.  Sola Sound Tone Bender (\\"MK1.5\\")  This version of the Tone Bender is a two transistor circuit, upon which the better known Arbiter Fuzz Face and Italian-made Vox Tone Bender are based. It is essentially a negative feedback amplifier. Although this was de facto a second version, no version number was used on its case. To differentiate it from the MKI and MKII, it is known as the \\"MK1.5\\" today. This successor of the original Tone Bender was available, at the latest, by February 1966. The electronics are contained in a sand-cast aluminum enclosure, with sheet metal (steel) base plate. It was also available in different guises as Sola Sound made OEM products or prototypes for other companies such as Rotosound. Another variant was the elusive Rangemaster Fuzzbug. Little is known about this unit. As Dallas Musical Ltd. had a 'Rangemaster' brand of products at the time, it is likely it had been made for that company. The Arbiter Fuzz Face, which was released later in 1966, is a clone of an early variant of the Tone Bender MK1.5, that featured a 500k volume pot instead of the more common 100k, providing a fuller low end. The bias point was slightly adjusted to make it less susceptible to temperature changes.  Sola Sound Tone Bender Professional MKII  The MKII Tone Bender is a three transistor circuit based on the MKI.V version, but with an additional amplifier gain stage. Sola Sound produced the circuit for Vox, Marshall and RotoSound as well. These units were named Vox Tone Bender Professional MKII, Marshall Supa Fuzz, RotoSound Fuzz Box. Vox Tone Bender Professional MKII Marshall Supa Fuzz RotoSound Fuzz Box There also was a version of the short lived Rangemaster Fuzzbug containing this circuit. Other variants may exist. The Sola Sound and Vox version used the same sturdy, sand cast metal enclosure designed by Hurst as the MK1.5 version. In fact, most Sola Sound branded MKIIs were probably leftover stock of MK1.5s with the circuit modified to MKII specs and a \\"Professional MKII\\" silkscreen added, presumably to differentiate them from the earlier version. These MK1.5 conversions can be identified by their smaller circuit board. Only few Sola Sound branded units with a large circuit board exist. It seems the last of them were rebranded from Sola Sound to Vox. After that point only Vox branded Tone Bender Professional MKIIs seem to have been produced. By November 1966 the pedal was being advertised in Beat Instrumental magazine, marketed as a \\"Gary Hurst Design\\".Beat Instrumental, November 1966 The circuit remained in production until early 1968. Marshall continued producing a slightly different looking version of the Supa Fuzz until at least 1972. Most units used Mullard OC75 or Impex S31T transistors. Shortly before production ended a batch of pedals using Mullard OC81D audio driver transistors had been made. Most of these are branded Vox Tone Bender Professional MKII, but Rotosound Fuzz Boxes and Marshall Supa Fuzzes from that era do exist. After being out of production for over 40 years, the Sola Sound Tone Bender Professional MKII is available again from Macari's since 2009 as part of their Vintage Series of pedals. It is being made by D*A*M Pedals, South Yorkshire.  Sola Sound Tone Bender MKIII, IV, Tone-Bender Fuzz  The Sola Sound Tone Bender MKIII, and later Tone Bender MKIV, featured a tone control. It's a three transistor circuit with a germanium diode, that came in several different enclosures and is closely related to the Burns Baldwin Buzzaround. It was available under different names and brands. Most MKIII Tone Benders are branded as Vox. The Sola Sound version is scarce. The Park Fuzz Sound and Rotosound Fuzz Box were also available with this circuit. By 1969 the same circuit was sold in a smaller updated case as the Sola Sound Tone Bender MKIV. The larger MKIII version was sold concurrently. The Carlsbro Fuzz and Park Fuzz Sound were available in the MKIV enclosure as well. By 1971 the MKIV's graphics were updated, marketing the device as the \\"Tone-Bender Fuzz\\" from that point onwards. By the mid-70's it was also available in another different enclosure, branded as the CSL Super Fuzz. The circuit was discontinued around 1976 and reintroduced in 2012, once again with MKIV graphics. A short lived version of the MKIII with only two controls, containing a circuit with four silicon transistors exists. It probably predates the more common germanium version.  Colorsound Supa Tonebender  The Supa Tone Bender is a four transistor circuit, based on the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff π. File:Sola_Sound_Colorsound_Supa_Tonebender%2C_from_1974.pngA 1974 Colorsound Supa Tonebender File:Sola_Sound_Colorsound_Supa_Tonebender%2C_1974%2C_internals.pngThe innards of a Colorsound Supa Tonebender, made MAY 30 1974  Colorsound Jumbo Tone Bender  The Jumbo Tone Bender is a three transistor circuit based on the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff π. Sola Sound made this pedal under various names, in various enclosures and for various distributors. It can be found in a narrow Colorsound enclosure with the same graphics as the late germanium Tone Benders, a wide Colorsound enclosure, using Jumbo Tone Bender graphics, in Vox MKIII Tone Bender enclosures, in a different narrow enclosure rebranded as B&M; (Champion) Fuzz, B&M; Fuzz Unit, CMI Fuzz Unit, G.B. Fuzz, G.B. Fuzz Unit or Pro Traffic Fuzz Unit or in a smaller enclosure labeled as the Eurotec Black Box Fuzz Module. It was also part of the Colorsound Supa Wah-Fuzz-Swell. The current \\"thin case\\" Tone Bender is using this circuit.  Vox Tone Bender  The Vox Tone Bender (model no. V828 in Vox's 1966 US price list) is based on the same circuit topology as the MK1.5 version. It was made for Thomas Organ Co. by the Jen company in Italy. This circuit uses different component values and transistor types making it different in tone and behavior. It used a PCB instead of the UK built MK1.5 which used strip board. Different transistor and capacitor setups have been used over the years. Earlier variants are fuller sounding, while later ones are rather bright and cutting. It is assumed that these were initially made for the US market, while the Sola Sound made units were distributed in the UK and Europe. JEN used the enclosures and circuit boards to make Fuzz for other companies such as Elka, Gretch and Luxor. They also released it under their own name of JEN and used the enclosure for a range of other effects.

The Centre originated in a fund established by the Catholic Church (the Irish Priests Committee) to provide support for young Irish emigrants in London, and many of its staff in the early years were priests and other members of the Church. With Ireland suffering from recession at the time, and Britain in need of workers in a number of industries and services, tens of thousands crossed the Irish Sea in search of opportunities. The Centre itself opened in 1955, providing accommodation (serving as a hostel in its early years), employment support and a starting point to those arriving. The Camden Square location was chosen for its proximity to Euston Station, where Irish people disembarked their trains from Holyhead Ferry Port. The London Irish Centre soon became a hub of Irish social activity, with dinners, dances and social functions. At the core of the Centre's focus remains \\"providing assistance to Irish expatriates in London, whether they have been there for decades or have just arrived\\". The welfare service remains the largest for Irish people outside Ireland. The Centre also provides a number of cultural activities to a wider membership, including music and language classes and concerts, as well as conferences and other discussion events hosted in Camden Square. In addition to this site the Centre also has offices in West Kensington and Kilburn. In its history the Centre has hosted visits from Presidents of Ireland Mary Robinson (in 1993) and Michael D. Higgins (in 2012), as well as other political figures from Ireland and Britain.

Background  Bi Xian was born in 802, during the reign of Emperor Dezong. His family was originally from Yun Prefecture (鄆州, in modern Tai'an, Shandong) and originally claimed ancestry from Ji Gao (), a son of King Wen of Zhou, who was created the Lord of Bi, although his traceable ancestry only went back to his fifth-generation ancestor, Bi Jing (), who served as a prefectural prefect during Tang Dynasty. Bi Xian's grandfather Bi Jun () served as a prefectural secretary general, while his father Bi Yun () served as a musical scholar in the ministry of worship.New Book of Tang, vol. 75 . Bi Xian lost his father early in life, and was poor in his childhood. However, he was said to be diligent, and he studied by burning wood and reading by the fire. After he was grown, he was well-studied in the Confucian classics and the histories, but was particularly capable in writing poetry.  During Emperors Wenzong's and Wuzong's reigns  Bi Xian passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class in the middle of the Taihe era (827-835) of Emperor Dezong's great-great-grandson Emperor Wenzong, and he later passed a special imperial examination for those who made good rulings. Thereafter, when the official Du Cong served as the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan), Du invited Bi to serve as an assistant.As Du served as the military governor of Zhongwu from 834 to about 838, Bi's service at Zhongwu must be during that period as well. See Old Book of Tang, vols. 17, part 2, 147. When Du later served as the director of finances, Bi served as a traveling reviewer under him.As Du served as the director of finances from about 838 to sometime early in the 840s, Bi's service at that directory must be during that period as well. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. Later, when Du served as the military governor of Huainan Circuit (淮南, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), he continued to serve on Du's staff.As Du served as the military governor of Huainan from sometime in the early 840s to 844, Bi's service at Huainan must be during that period as well. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. When Du was recalled to the capital Chang'an to serve as chancellor in 844 by then-reigning Emperor Wuzong (Emperor Wenzong's younger brother), Bi returned to Chang'an as well and was made an imperial censor, initially with the title of Jiancha Yushi (), then as Shi Yushi (). At that time, however, another chancellor, Li Deyu, was the leading figure at court, and Li did not get along with Du.New Book of Tang, vol. 183. In 845, Du was therefore sent out of Chang'an to serve as the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (東川, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan).Old Book of Tang, vol. 147. Because Du had offended Li, his former subordinates largely did not dare to send Du off, but Bi did. Li, hearing this, was displeased, and sent Bi out of the capital to serve as the prefect of Ci Prefecture (磁州, in modern Handan, Hebei).  During Emperor Xuānzong's reign  After Emperor Wuzong died in 846 and was succeeded by his uncle Emperor Xuānzong, Li Deyu lost power, and many of those whom Li had demoted were promoted.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248. Bi Xian was thereafter made Hubu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of census (戶部, Hubu), with his office at the eastern capital Luoyang. He was then recalled to Chang'an to serve as Jiabu Yuanwailang (), a low-level official at the ministry of defense (兵部, Bingbu) in charge of imperial messengers' horses and wagons, and then as Cangbu Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of census in charge of imperial money and food storages.New Book of Tang, vol. 46. During those times, the Jiabu and Cangbu assignments were not considered honored assignments, and officials who were from prominent clans would be displeased if assigned to them, but Bi accepted them happily and respectfully, impressing the chancellors who assigned him. He was thereafter made Zhifang Langzhong (), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense in charge of military maps, as well as supervisory censor (侍御史知雜, Shi Yushi Zhiza). He was soon made an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) and Zhongshu Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). As of 852, Emperor Xuānzong had to deal with frequent Dangxiang incursions on the northwest borders, and he was hoping to find a suitable military governor (Jiedushi) for Binning Circuit (邠寧, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), but could not find one. On one occasion, when he discussed with Bi what proper border policies should be, Bi discussed the history and listed a number of suggestions that he had. Emperor Xuānzong was impressed, compared him to the prominent Zhao generals Lian Po and Li Mu, and asked him whether he would be willing to accept the Binning assignment. Bi agreed cheerfully. Emperor Xuānzong, in order to increase his prominence before sending him out on assignment, first made him the deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang), then made him the military governor of Binning. Later that year, he reported that the Dangxiang troubling Binning had all been pacified. That allowed Binning's headquarters, which had been temporarily moved from Bin Prefecture () to Ning Prefecture (寧州, in modern Qingyang, Gansu) due to the Dangxiang incursions, to be returned to Bin Prefecture in spring 855.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. It was said that while at Binning, Bi encouraged the soldiers to tend the fields and grow crops for the military food supplies, allowing them to be supplied adequately at a reduced cost to the imperial treasury. He was later transferred to Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) and then Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). As Hedong was on the border, Bi established 70 watch posts to defend against attacks. However, while it was said that Emperor Xuānzong had previously promised him that he would be recalled to serve as chancellor, then-lead chancellor Linghu Tao was fearful of him, and therefore he was never recalled during that timespan.  During Emperor Yizong's reign  Emperor Xuānzong died in 859 and was succeeded by his son Emperor Yizong. Thereafter, Bi Xian was transferred to Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), and yet later recalled to Chang'an to serve as the minister of census (戶部尚書, Hubu Shangshu) as well as the director of finances. In 860, Emperor Yizong made him the minister of rites (禮部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and gave him the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250. As chancellor, he was said to be a capable administrator and talented in his writing. He served as a chancellor until 863, when he resigned his chancellor post, ostensibly due to illness, but was said to have actually resigned because he was unhappy that his chancellor colleagues did not uphold the law properly. He was thereafter made the minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu). He was thereafter made the military governor of Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), and died two months later, in early 864.

Haenigsen had been doing a strip about a teenage boy, Our Bill (1939-1963), when he launched Penny as a Sunday strip on June 27, 1943. A daily strip debuted September 3, 1945. The prolific cartoonist Bill Hoest was Haenigsen's assistant on Penny. After an injury from a 1965 traffic accident kept Haenigsen away from the drawing board, Hoest took over most of the work, although Haenigsen still supervised and signed each Penny strip. In 1968, Hoest left to start his own strip, The Lockhorns, for the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. Haenigsen chose to end Penny in 1970 and retired.

By country =Germany= In Germany, during World War II, IBM engaged in business practices which have been the source of controversy. Much attention focuses on the role of IBM's German subsidiary, known as Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen Gesellschaft, or Dehomag. Topics in this regard include *documenting operations by Dehomag which allowed the Nazis to better organize their war effort, and in particular the Holocaust and use of Nazi concentration camps; *comparing these efforts to operations by other IBM subsidiaries which aided other nations' war efforts; *and ultimately, assessing the degree to which IBM should be held culpable for atrocities which were made possible by its actions. *the selection methods as developed and used had the purpose to select and kill civil people. =United States= In the United States IBM was, at the request of the government, the subcontractor for the Japanese internment camps' punched card project: IBM equipment was used for cryptography by US Army and Navy organisations, Arlington Hall and OP-20-G and similar Allied organisations using Hollerith punched cards (Central Bureau and the Far East Combined Bureau). The company developed and built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator which was used to perform computations for the Manhattan project. Critics of IBM's actions during World War II A 2001 book by Edwin Black, entitled IBM and the Holocaust, reached the conclusion that IBM's commercial activities in Germany during World War II make it morally complicit in the Holocaust. An updated 2002 paperback edition of the book included new evidence of the connection between IBM's United States headquarters, which controlled a Polish subsidiary, and the Nazis. Oliver Burkeman wrote for The Guardian, \\"The paperback provides the first evidence that the company's dealings with the Nazis were controlled from its New York headquarters throughout the second world war.\\" In February 2001, an Alien Tort Claims Act claim was filed in U.S. federal court on behalf of concentration camp survivors against IBM. The suit accused IBM of allegedly providing the punched card technology that facilitated the Holocaust, and for covering up German IBM subsidiary Dehomag's activities. In April 2001, the lawsuit was dropped after lawyers feared the suit would slow down payments from a German Holocaust fund for Holocaust survivors who had suffered under Nazi persecution. IBM's German division had paid $3 million into the fund, while making it clear they were not admitting liability. In 2004, the human rights organization Gypsy International Recognition and Compensation Action (GIRCA) filed suit against IBM in Switzerland. The case was dismissed in 2006, as the statute of limitations had expired. =Responses to critics= In an \\"IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit\\", IBM responded in February 2001 that: Richard Bernstein, writing for The New York Times Book Review in 2001, pointed out that \\"many American companies did what I.B.M. did. ... What then makes I.B.M. different?\\" He states that Black's case in his book IBM and the Holocaust \\"is long and heavily documented, and yet he does not demonstrate that bears some unique or decisive responsibility for the evil that was done.\\" IBM quoted this claim in a March 2002 \\"Addendum to IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit,\\" after the publication of Black's revised paperback edition: See also * IBM and the Holocaust * German re-armament * List of International subsidiaries of IBM References World War II Category:Intelligence of World War II Category:Science and technology during World War II Category:Companies involved in the Holocaust ","title":"IBM during World War II"},{"id":"27106044","title":"List of Canadian number-one albums of 1968"},{"id":"27106064","text":"P. minuta may refer to: * Plethodontohyla minuta, a frog species endemic to Madagascar * Pseudis minuta, a frog species found in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay See also * Minuta ","title":"P. minuta"},{"id":"27106067","text":"Gisela Trowe (5 September 1922, in Dortmund – 5 April 2010, in Hamburg) was a German actress and voice actress.

Palazzo Aragona Gonzaga (also known as Palazzo Negroni or Palazzo Galitzin,Palazzo Galitzin: Touring Club Italiano, Roma e dintorni, 1965:216; Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Galitzin (1772–1821), was Russian ambassador to Rome; his son, Theodore Alexandrovich Galitzin (died 1848), lived here ((National Gallery, Washington): Pietro Perugino, Crucifixion triptych, provenance ).) is a 16th-century palace in Rome, Italy; it was once the residence of Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga. Today, its late Renaissance street facade bears plaques commemorating two of its residents, Saint Aloysius Gonzaga and the poet Torquato Tasso. The building is sited at the junction of the via della Scrofa and piazza Nicosia, adjacent to the Collegio Clementino. It was originally built in the late Renaissance style, but was given Baroque embellishments in the mid-18th century.  Architecture  Plaque commemorating Torquato Tasso's residency. Plaque commemorating Saint Aloysius's stay in the building. The ground plan of the building is irregular in order to fully occupy its street corner location. At first glance it appears to be rectangular, but closer inspection reveals that it is in fact an irregular pentagon. The palace comprises five floors above a semi-basement. Its style is broadly based on Palazzo Farnese; the lower floors exemplifying the architecture of the late Renaissance found in Rome and in villas throughout the Latium. The principal facade comprises five bays. The ground floor is pierced centrally by the entrance to a porte cochere leading to an internal courtyard. The corners of the irregular building are accentuated by quoining, while shallow pilasters divide the five bays from the first floor upwards. Externally, the ground floor shows banded rustication (very similar to that found in the Roman Palazzo Vidoni Caffarelli, built in 1515 and attributed to Raphael), while the floors above are of rendered ochre ashlar. In the custom of the time, the ground floor was designed for occupation by only horses, servants and domestic offices. Here on the first floor, the piano nobile, were the principal rooms. As in most Renaissance palazzi, the upper floors are reached by a broad stone staircase rising from the cloisterlike inner courtyard, this negated the need for the upper floor's noble occupants to ever visit the menial ground floor rooms. The piano nobile contains an enfilade of principal reception rooms; the importance of these rooms is denoted on the exterior by the large size of the windows and their alternating segmental and pointed pediments. View by Giuseppe Vasi of the Piazza Nicosia in 1748. The obtuse corner of the building (‘’pictured below’’), with its fountain, is to the left. The obtuse facade and its fountain The second floor is aesthetically divided from the first by a double band and it is quite possible that all above this band is a later addition. If this were the case, then the palace would have originally followed the simple two-storey design, which so appealed to Raphael.Raphael not only lived himself in such a two- storey house (designed by Bramante), but also designed the Palazzo Vidoni Caffarelli, Rome, and the Palazzo Pandolfini, Florence, in the same manner. The early architectural history of the building is poorly documented. What is known is that in 1701, architect Carlo Francesco Bizzaccheri added the top floor.Mallory, p41 However, the architect was either not working in his usual style or it has been subsequently altered, for the uppermost floor appears of no more architectural merit than those added to many other palazzi during the 18th and 19th centuries.Mallory, p41. opines that this floor is totally without merits and also ascribes this view to Charles Percier in his Palais, maisons et autres edifices modernes dessinés à Rome (Paris, 1798); the better known Palazzo Vidoni Caffarelli has a near identical upper floor. Copplestone, p245. It may be that Bizzaccheri's work was altered; circa 1746 the building was acquired by the newly ennobled Negroni family who sometime between acquiring ownership and 1759 modernised the principal facade, creating its present-day appearance.The approximate date of the work has been calculated from various sources by Mallory, p41 This work included the Baroque pediments of the second floor windows and the pediments of the mezzanine floor. The latter were decorated with sheaths and arrows from the Negroni coat of arms, while the central pediment of the piano nobile was given extra prominence by the addition of a Negro's head in bas relief, the armorial crest of the Negroni. The edifice is built around a central courtyard, which contains one of the palace's two fountains. The court fountain depicts the Virgin Mary; this is not contemporary with the building, Pulvers, p. 705 and it was probably replacing an existing fountain during the Galitzin era of the later 19th century. The second fountain is on the external corner of the palace which tapers to the confluence of via dells Scrofa and piazza Nicosia. This is a more simple utilitarian tough fountain for the use of animals and people on the street. The ready supply of water to the building came from the re-opened the Acqua Vergine aqueduct, which had been restored in 1453. Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga  Occupancy  The building was most notably the residence of Cardinal Scipione Gonzaga, a scion of the Gonzaga family, who had ruled Mantua in Northern Italy from 1328. However, it is not for his piety or noble connections that the cardinal is chiefly remembered, but for his friendship and patronage of the troubled poet Torquato Tasso and his support, against other family members, for his cousin Saint Aloysius Gonzaga. Saint Aloysius stayed in the building from 20 November 1585 before renouncing his worldly possessions and rank and joining the Society of Jesus. To both Gonzaga and Tasso, the Cardinal's residence was a refuge in time of trouble. Following the cardinal's death in 1593, the building changed ownership, and thus its name, several times. Passing through the hands of the Casate and Astalli o Staglia families, before being acquired by the Negroni and undergoing renovations and alteration. Following the Negroni it passed to the Vecchiarelli family.Monumenti Roma In the 19th century, it became the residence of Prince Theodore Alexandrovich Galitzin, the son of Prince Alexander Mikhailovich Galitzin (1772–1821), Russian Ambassador to Rome. Today, much of the building is sub-divided into offices and apartments. It is not open to the public.  Notes   Sources Copplestone, Trewin (1963). World Architecture.

She has served as head of the theoretical track at the Department of Film and Television, at Tel Aviv University, and currently heads the Department of Culture and Production at Sapir College. Biography Nurith Gertz was born in Jerusalem and attended the Hebrew Gymnasium and the Kanot Agricultural School. In 1969 she received a B.A. in Literature and Political Science from the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, and in 1973 an M.A. in Poetics and Comparative Literature from Tel Aviv University. She received a doctorate from Tel Aviv University in 1979; her dissertation engaged with the topic ‘Generation Shift in Literary History: The Generation of the Sixties in Hebrew-Narrative Prose’, supervised by Prof. Benjamin Hrushovski (Harshav). Nurith Gertz joined the faculty of The Open University of Israel in the early 1980s. In the 1990s, she shifted her research focus to film, and was appointed Full Professor in 2001. At that period, she also taught at Tel Aviv University’s Department of Film, and from 2003 to 2009 was the university’s Head of Theoretical Film Studies. Since 2008, she has served as head of the Culture and Production department at Sapir College’s B.A. programme. She was a Visiting Assistant Professor at U.C. Berkeley in 1984, and in 1989-1990 as well as 2001, was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Yale University, in Judaic Studies, Cinema Studies and Comparative Literature. In 1996 and 2004 she was visiting professor at the Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania and in 2006, she gave a course on the history of Palestinian cinema at the Cinema Department of the Paris 8 University, Paris. Grants and awards Nurith Gertz has been awarded several research grants and literature awards, among them grants in 2003 and 2008 from the Israeli Science Foundation; in 2006 from The Minerva Center for Human Rights; and in 2005-2006 from the Israeli Palestinian Science Organization for a joint research with producer and director George Khleifi. She won the Brenner Prize for Literature in 2009 for her book Unrepentant (Al Da’at atzmo: Arba’ah pirkei haim shel Amos Kenan), and in 2010 received the Israeli Book Publishers’ Association Gold Award (2010). In the same year she was also nominated for the Sapir Prize for Literature. The book joined the list of the Ten Books of the Decade, a list drawn up by the Yediot Aharonot newspaper, and was named one of the five books of the decade by \\"Galei Tzahal\\" Radio. Research Nurith Gertz’s chief research spheres are Hebrew literature, Israeli and Palestinian film, Israeli culture and society, as well as private and collective trauma and memory. Among her books: Amos Oz: Monograph was published in 1980, and is grounded on her masters thesis. It describes the works of Amos Oz at that time, and provides an extensive discussion of changes unfolding in Israeli culture and on the map of Hebrew literature. Hirbet Hiza’a and The Morning After, published in 1983, draws on her doctoral dissertation and deals with the changing norms in literary writing in the 1960s. Captive of a Dream: National Myths in Israeli Culture was published in Hebrew in 1995 and in English in 2000. Received with accolades, the book offers a multidisciplinary analysis of literature, leaders’ speeches, critiques in the press and cinema. It lays bare the roots of myths on which Israel culture was structured. Gertz shows in this book that the various media have shared traits, similar plots and narratives that recur and reproduce themselves in each era, with inherent myths that clash and debate with each other. A different chorus: Holocaust Survivors, Aliens and Others in Israeli Cinema and Literature was published in 2004. It engages with the charged encounter between Holocaust survivors and Israelis, and the gradual changes that evolved in their reciprocal relations. Using historical, cinematic, and literary sources, Gertz examines how Israeli society shaped its identity through the image of ‘others’, the marginalized ‘aliens’ as well as those who - in a long and painful process - were finally accepted. Through the case study of Holocaust survivors, the book presents the ways in which Israeli society finally acknowledged alien memories and spaces as being part of its own history. Space and Memory in Palestinian Cinema, written together with George Khleifi, was published in Hebrew in 2006 and in English in 2008. The book explores the history of Palestinian film, with emphasis on the four founding filmmakers – Michel Khleifi, Rashid Masharawi, Ali Nassar, and Elia Suleiman. It looks at the connections between cinematic creation, trauma and repressed memory through social and political developments. A major theme in the book is the issue of continuity that Palestinian film tries to disclose – between the ostensibly lost time and the tribulations of the present. Gertz and Khleifi maintain that Palestinian cinema attempts to create continuity of the Palestinian historical memory while striving to work through the traumatic event of 1948. Fiction Not From Here (El Ma Shenamog, co-authored with Dvorah Gertz) was published in 1997. This documentary-fictional work, explores the biography of Dvorah Gertz, Nurith Gert'z mother, from Warsaw to Italy, then immigration to a kibbutz in Israel where she met Aharon Gertz. The broad historical canvas that weaves together events and dreams, is built on and streamlined in her second documentary-fictional work Unrepentant (Al Da’at atzmo: Arba'a pirkei haim shel Amos Kenan). Unrepentant (Al Da’at atzmo: Arba’ah pirkei haim shel Amos Kenan) was published in Hebrew in 2008 and is Gertz’s second documentary- fictional work. As in her previous book in this genre, she integrates realistic documentation of historical events with an affectionate work of fiction that enters its protagonist’s consciousness, memories and dreams. The book describes four periods in the life of Amos Kenan, author, sculptor, and poet, who was Nurith Gertz’s life partner. It opens with Kenan’s childhood, with the mental decline of his father Yakov Levine, a member of the Labour Battalion (Gdud HaAvodah) who lived according to the Zionist dream and the dream of the Socialist revolution – but ended as a victim of both. The following chapter tracks Kenan’s joining the Lehi underground (Stern Group) before and during 1948 war. It describes moments in which dreams and longings handed down from father to son clash with the reality of war. The next chapter follows Kenan's life during the first decade of the state of Israel, and his disillusionment that finally leads to his arrest for attempting to assassinate Israeli Transportation Minister David-Zvi Pinkas. The final chapter depicts Kenan’s life in Paris and follows his love-story with the author Christiane Rochefort, that ultimately became destructive. ‘Unrepentant’ was immensely acclaimed both by critics and readers and became a best-seller. Nurith Gertz is a prolific researcher in the fields of Israeli and Palestinian film and literature, and her prose which combines historical documentary and fantasy, created an innovative style in Hebrew literature. She has two daughters, journalist Shlomzion Kenan, and poet and songwriter Rona Kenan.

He qualified as an architect in 1900; but in 1895 had already visited Egypt and assisted Somers Clarke with his book on the temple of Amenhotep III. From 1902 to 1903 Richmond served in the Royal Engineers on construction works for the British army of occupation in Egypt. In 1904 he was appointed architect in the Ministry of Works, and rose to be Director of the Department of Towns and State buildings, serving in that capacity until 1911, when he returned to private practice in Britain. In 1906 he married Margaret Muriel Lubbock.E. T. Richmond Papers, Durham University Library, Archives and Special Collections . During the First World War Richmond worked for the War Office from 1914–16, joining up at first in the Ambulance Corps. After suffering an injury to his hand from a grenade, he was appointed Architect to the War Graves Service, France, 1917–18. After the War he was recruited as Consulting Architect to the Haram ash-Sharif, Jerusalem, 1918–20, and afterwards as Assistant Civil Secretary (Political), Government of Palestine, 1920–24 - a post from which he resigned in protest against the pro-Zionist policy of the British Government. In 1926 Richmond was converted to Roman Catholic Christianity; and thereafter his Christian faith played a greater part in his life and writings. From 1927 to 1937 Richmond served as Director of Antiquities for the Government of Palestine.Wasserstein, 1991, pp. 240–241. Afterwards he returned to Britain and settled in Gloucestershire, where he continued to write and take an interest in Palestine affairs. He died aged 80 in 1955.

It is based on the game two four jacks,Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett pg. 291 Oxford University Press (1996) using a custom deck of cards written in both English and Czech. The game has seven levels, each level adding new functionality. The sole aim of Flaps is to discard all of the cards in one's hand; the first player to play his final card, and ergo have no cards left, wins the game. Object FLAPS is played with a custom deck of playing cards. Each player at his turn may play any card from his hand that matches the suit or the rank of the card previously played; for example, if the previous card was a seven of clubs, the next player may put down any seven card, or any club card, from his hand. Should the player not have any card available to play or not wish to go, he must pick up one card. Game Rules Players are initially dealt seven cards. The remainder of the deck is placed face down and serve as a \\"pool\\" or drawing stack. At the beginning of the game the topmost card from the \\"pool\\" is revealed and play begins. The first to play (generally, the player on the dealer's left) should select from his or her hand a card that matches either, the suit or the rank of the open card (the card that is \\"top\\"); for example, on a 10 of spades, only a spade card or a 10 may be played. If a player is not able to place a card or doesn't want to lay a card, he takes a card from the drawing stack. If the drawing stack is empty or nearly so, the playing stack or discard pile (except for the topmost card) is inverted and placed face down beneath the remaining drawing stack, preserving the order of the cards previously played. When a FLAP card is laid, anyone can lay FLAPS cards in any order, so long as they interleave (i.e. take turns) with the other players. When the Flapping is finished, play continues in the same direction, following suit or number as normal. =Level 1 Cards= FLAPS Level 1 cards are as follows: *ACE, ACE'N'END and ACE'N'LAY: There are three ACEs; no ACE of Diamonds. There are two ACE'N'ENDs; one Diamonds, one Spades. There are four ACE'N'LAYs one of each suit. Players can lay any type of ACE on any suit and on any type of ACE. If they lay an ACE they can choose the suit to be played. As an ACE is easy to lay, it would be easy to finish on - so players can't finish on it. If it is laid as a last card then player must call a suit First and pick up from the drawing stack Second. An ACE'N'END works the same way as an ACE except players can finish on it. If players lay an ACE'N'LAY (ANY RED CARD) they can choose the suit to be played as either Diamonds or Hearts and then lay a Diamond, Heart or any type of ACE (including any ACE'N'LAY). If players lay an ACE'N'LAY (ANY BLACK CARD) they can choose the suit to be played as either Clubs or Spades and then lay a Club, Spade or any type of ACE (including any ACE'N'LAY). If players do not have another playable card or just don't want to go, they must call the suit First and pick up Second. As it would be easy to finish using an ACE'N'LAY, it can't be used as last or penultimate card. *2s, 3s, 7s and 9s: There are eight 2s, eight 3s, eight 7s and eight 9s; two of each suit. The 2s and 3s can be considered as 'attacking' cards, while 7s and 9s are 'defensive'. Penalties arising from played 2s and 3s are cumulative in the direction of play. If a player lays a 2, then the next player must pick up 2 cards from the drawing stack unless that player has one of the following and wants to lay it: Any other 2. That means the next player must pick up four (2 + 2) cards, or lay a 3, 7 or 9 of the same suit or any other 2. A 3 of the same suit. That means the next player must pick up five (2 + 3) cards, or lay a 2, 7 or 9 of the same suit or any other 3. A 7 of the same suit. The direction of play is reversed. That means the player who laid the 2 must pick up those cards from the drawing stack, or lay a 2, 3 or 9 of the same suit or any other 7. A seven only reverses direction of play when preceded by a 2, 3 or 7. A 9 of the same suit. That means that the effect of the cards is cancelled and the next player just follows suit or number as normal. No one has to pick up any cards this time. The same rules apply to 3 - pick up three cards etc. Players can choose to pick up the sum of penalty cards laid, even if they could pass them on (2 or 3), reverse them (7) or stop them (9). *4 - FLAPS and MF - MEGA-FLAP: There are sixteen FLAPS cards; four of each suit. There is only one MEGA-FLAP card, in the suit of hearts. If a player lays a 4 - FLAPS, the normal rules of next player to go are abandoned temporarily and any player can lay a FLAP card, although no one has to. No player can lay a FLAP on their own previously laid FLAP - it's a bit like taking turns. After all Flapping has apparently ceased, the next player must ask \\"any more Flapping ?\\" and then lay, following suit or number as normal. The direction of play is the same as before, with suit and number determined by the last FLAP card laid. The next player can also lay a FLAP, even if his FLAP was the last laid in the previous Flapping; that would be a new start of Flapping. There is one way of laying up to three FLAPS, without waiting for other players to interleave and that is by using the MEGA-FLAP card. When a player lays the MEGA-FLAP card, they can then lay up to three more FLAPS, one at a time, whether or not other players are able to interleave their own FLAP cards. *8s: There are eight 8s; two of each suit. If a player lays an eight, the next player must miss a go (and knock on the table) or lay another 8. Players can choose to 'knock' or go as they please, they do not have to lay an 8 if they have one. *10s and Qs - HOOFERS-DOOFERS: There are eight 10s; two of each suit. There are four HOOFERS-DOOFERS Queens; one of each suit. The 10s can be considered as 'attacking' cards, while HOOFERS-DOOFERS are 'defensive'. If a player lays a 10 they can choose any other player to pick up one penalty card from the drawing stack. That is, unless the player chosen has a HOOFERS- DOOFERS card of any suit and wants to lay it. Then it is their turn to choose a player to pick up the penalty card. Thus, the penalty arising from a played 10 is singular, while HOOFERS-DOOFERS can be used to redirect the penalty to another player. The penalty effect of a played 10 persists until a targeted player is unable to play a HOOFERS-DOOFERS. After the scuffle is over, play resumes as normal, in the same direction as before, with suit and number determined by last card laid. *JACKS, UP-JACKS and ACE-JACKS: There are four JACKS; one of each suit. There are three UP-JACKS; UP-JACKS of Hearts is missing. There are two ACE-JACKS and they are suit-less. If a player lays a JACK, the direction of play is reversed. If there are only two players, this naturally makes no difference. If a player lays an UP-JACKS, the direction of play is reversed and all players, except the player who laid the card, must pick up one card. An ACE-JACK can be laid on any suit. If a player lays an ACE-JACK, the direction of play is reversed and they can choose the suit to be played. The reason this card is called an ACE-JACK is because it has the function of a JACK and an ACE (see ACE). As an ACE-JACK is easy to lay, it can't be used as a last card. Players can lay a JACK or UP-JACKS of any suit on an ACE-JACK. *5s, QUEENS and KINGS: There are eight fives; two of each suit. There are four Kings; one of each suit. There are four Queens; one of each suit. These cards are boring because they don't do anything. =Endgame= As soon as a player plays their last card, so long as the card is eligible as a last card, they win the game. If the last card is a card that cannot be finished on, they must take another card from the drawing stack. =Last Card rule= When a player lays their second-to-last card they must say \\"Last Card\\". This gives the other players time to collaborate and find a way to stop that last card being laid; conspiracy between players when another player is low on cards is positively encouraged. If someone forgets to say \\"Last Card\\" before the next player lays a card, then that forgetful player must take another card from the drawing stack as soon as their error is discovered. Variations =Original FLAPS Game= The original FLAPS game published in 1994 was in English only. Additional Levels =Level 2 Cards= FLAPS Level 2 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1. The cards are as follows: *K - TRUMPS: There are four TRUMPS cards; one of each suit. If a player lays a TRUMPS card, a separate game is started. The initiating player must declare which suit will be TRUMPS; a card of the suit which is TRUMPS will beat the same card of any other suit. Each player, starting with the player to the left of the player initiating the TRUMPS game, lays a card, face down on the table, not on the upturned pack. When all players have completed this step, the cards are turned face up, in the same sequence. The player who lays the lowest-scoring card must pick up all the cards laid as part of the Trumps game. It is important to note that it is not necessary to win a game of TRUMPS, it is only desirable to not lose. If any player is on last card when a game of TRUMPS is initiated, the act of laying that last card does not constitute a win until the game of TRUMPS has finished and that player did not lose. If that last card is ineligible for finishing, such as an Ace, then that player must take another card from the drawing stack unless the player loses the TRUMPS game. The highest value card in TRUMPS is OL' MAID 1, then OL' MAIDs 2, 3 and 4. Next highest is the King of the chosen TRUMPS suit, down to the Ace of the chosen TRUMPS suit. Next highest is the King of any of the other suits that are not TRUMPS. ACE-JACKS are lowest of the low. If two or more cards laid in a game of TRUMPS are the same, the players with those cards must cut the drawing stack to determine the holder of the higher value card. The suit declared as TRUMPS still applies OL' MAIDS are still high. The player who cuts the lowest value card must pick up all cards laid as part of the TRUMPS game. *OL' MAID: There are four OL' MAIDs, numbered 1 to 4. During normal play, Ol' MAIDs can only be laid on the following cards; JACK, UP-JACKS, ACE-JACK, QUEEN, HOOFERS- DOOFERS, KING (but not TRUMPS). The only reason the OL' MAIDS are numbered is to determine which is highest in a TRUMPS game. The rest of the time they are a mixed-blessing. On one hand, players need an OL' MAID to give them a chance of not losing TRUMPS. On the other hand, they cannot finish using an OL' MAID as last card and it can be difficult to get rid of. OL' MAIDS cannot be laid on OL' MAIDS. Players cannot play an Ace'N'Lay ANY BLACK CARD and then an OL' MAID, even if an OL' MAID is a black card. The reason players cannot lay an OL' MAID on TRUMPS is to stop players from getting rid of the OL' MAID that they just received by losing a TRUMPS game. If a player lays an OL' MAID as their last card, they must pick up another card from the drawing stack. =Level 3 Cards= FLAPS Level 3 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 and 2 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1 and 2. The cards are as follows: *0 - QUACK: The QUACK card is suitless and is the only 0 in the pack. The card can only be laid when a player is attacked with a 2, 3 or 7 of any suit, thus enabling that player to 'duck' and pass on the sum of the penalty cards laid. The reason the card is a 0, is that it does not add to the sum like a 2 or a 3 but otherwise works in the same way. Players can finish on a QUACK, but only if they are under attack by a 2, 3 or 7. QUACK is scored lower than an ACE-JACK in a game of TRUMPS. *4 - STOP THAT FLAPPING: The STOP THAT FLAPPING card can be laid like any other 4 - FLAPS card, except that it stops all flapping. The same rules of interleaving apply, so players cannot lay STOP THAT FLAPPING on their own FLAPS unless it is part of a MEGA-FLAP sequence. If someone else lays the MEGA-FLAP card, laying STOP THAT FLAPPING reduces the number of FLAPS that can follow the MEGA-FLAP card to two. To have any effect in a MEGA-FLAP sequence, STOP THAT FLAPPING must therefore be laid before the third FLAPS is laid in the sequence. It is permissible for one player to lay MEGA-FLAP, FLAPS, FLAPS, STOP THAT FLAPPING. *5 - DUMP THOSE FIVES: The DUMP THOSE FIVES card is similar to the MEGA-FLAP card, in that up to three more 5s can follow. Players cannot finish by laying DUMP THOSE FIVES, 5, 5, 5 but can of course go down to last card that way. If players do play their last card in a DUMP THOSE FIVES sequence, they must take another card from the drawing stack. The last 5 laid in the sequence is the active card. *6 - SIX OF THE BEST: The SIX OF THE BEST card is a challenge to experienced FLAPS players. This is the only six in the pack, it doesn't have any special properties and is harder to lay than other cards. If a player lays this as their last card then they score a double win. *King 'N' Lay: The King 'N' Lay card works a bit like an Ace 'N' Lay card only it is much more restrictive. This card is a King of Clubs and can only be laid on a King, a Club or an Ace with Clubs called. When laid, the only cards that can follow are Kings, Clubs, OL' MAIDS and Aces. Players cannot finish by laying King 'N' Lay as their last-but-one card. =Level 4 Cards= FLAPS Level 4 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 - 3 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1 - 3. The cards are as follows: *K - SPOOF: There are two SPOOF cards; in the suits of clubs and spades. If a player lays a SPOOF card, a separate game is started (similar to TRUMPS) which players should aim to not lose. Each player lays a card face down, not on the upturned pack. Then, each player, starting with the one to the left of the player who initiated the SPOOF game, calls a number that they think is the total score of all cards laid in the SPOOF game. All OL' MAIDs score 20 in SPOOF. Aces and Ace-Jacks score 1. Picture cards (JACK, QUEEN, KING) score 10, all other cards score their face-value. For example, if there are four players, the total score could be a maximum of 80 (four OL'MAIDS) or a minimum of 3 (three Aces and a QUACK). So, if the first person says 33, the next person should say 32 or 34. Saying 35 would leave 34 open for the next player and that would make them safe even if the total was exactly 35. Players then turn over the cards laid in the SPOOF game. The person who chose a score furthest from the actual score picks up all the cards laid in the SPOOF game. If any player is on last card when a game of SPOOF is called, the act of laying that last card does not constitute a win until the game of SPOOF has finished and that player did not lose. If the last card is a card ineligible for finishing, such as an Ace, then that player must pick another card from the drawing stack unless they lose the SPOOF game. *LOW OL' MAID: There are two LOW OL' MAIDs. LOW OL' MAIDs and regular OL' MAIDs can only be laid on the following cards; JACK, UP-JACKS, ACE-JACK, QUEEN, HOOFERS-DOOFERS, KING (but not TRUMPS or SPOOF). The reason players cannot lay an OL' MAID on TRUMPS or SPOOF is to stop players from getting rid of any penalty OL' MAID that they just received during a TRUMPS or SPOOF game. The only good thing about a LOW OL' MAID is that it has such a high value in SPOOF and makes it easier for players to call higher or lower than the player before them. Apart from that, players cannot finish on a LOW OL' MAID and it is difficult to get rid of. LOW OL' MAIDS cannot be laid on LOW OL' MAIDS or OL'MAIDS. =Level 5 Cards= FLAPS Level 5 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 - 4 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1 - 4. The cards are as follows: *5 -LOSE A SECRET: Each player chooses a card from the hand of the player to their left and (without looking) places it face down next to the drawing stack. This small pile of cards is called the Solve the Mystery Pile. If a player lays LOSE A SECRET as their last but one card, they must pick up another card from the drawing stack after their last card is put into the Solve the Mystery Pile. *5 -PICK A SECRET: The player chooses a card from their own hand and places it face down on the Solve the Mystery Pile. If a player lays PICK A SECRET as their last but one card, they must pick up another card from the drawing stack after they put their last card into the Solve the Mystery Pile. *5 -START GUESSING - DO NOT LOOK: The player takes a card from the top of the drawing stack, doesn't look at it and places it face down on the Solve the Mystery Pile. *5 - START GUESSING - LOOK: The player takes a card from the top of the drawing stack, looks at it and places it face down on the Solve the Mystery Pile. *5 - SHARE A SECRET: The player takes a card from the hand of a player of their choice, looks at the card and places it face down on the Solve the Mystery Pile. *5 - SOLVE THE MYSTERY: The player must pick up the Solve the Mystery Pile. There are two SOLVE THE MYSTERY cards. =Level 6 Cards= FLAPS Level 6 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 - 5 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1 - 5. The cards are as follows: *1 - DOWN: The player takes a card from the pack, looks at it and then places it face-down in front of any player. If that player already has a 1-DOWN card in front of them, this new card should go on top. There are eight 1-DOWN cards. *1 - RIGHT: Each player moves any 1-DOWN cards in front of them so that they are in front of the player on their right. There are two 1-RIGHT cards. *1 - LEFT: Each player moves any 1-DOWN cards in front of them so that they are in front of the player on their left. There are two 1-LEFT cards. *1 - OVER: The player turns over any 1-DOWN card that is face-down in front of any player. This doesn't have to be the card at the top of a 1-DOWN pile. Leave the card face-up. There is one 1-OVER card. *1 - LOOK: The player can look at any 1-DOWN card that is face-down in front of any player. This doesn't have to be the card at the top of a 1-DOWN pile. The card is then put back, face-down, on top of the 1-DOWN pile from whence it came. If there are no 1-DOWN cards, the player can look at any one card from the hand of any player. There is one 1-LOOK card. *1 - SWAP: The player can Swap any card in their own hand with a 1-down card of any player. This doesn't have to be the card at the top of a 1-DOWN pile and can also be a face-up card. There is one 1-SWAP card. *1 - UP: The player can hoose any player to pick up the uppermost 1-DOWN card in front of them. There are four 1 - UP cards. =Level 7 Cards= FLAPS Level 7 cards are shuffled into the Level 1 - 6 pack when players agree they have mastered Level 1 - 6. The cards are as follows: *FULL MONTY: The player needs to have at least three cards remaining in their hand to use the FULL MONTY card, otherwise it has no effect. The player lays three of their cards face down, then chooses another player to indicate, but not take, a card. The initiating player then reveals one of the other two cards. The selected player can then take their original choice or the other face-down card. Only the player who started FULL MONTY and the other selected player know what card was taken.

The main vector for T. parva is the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Theiler found that East Coast fever was not the same as redwater, but caused by a different protozoan.  Life cycle  Sporozoites from the tick secrete into the feeding site of the animal. Sporozoites enter lymphoblasts to form a schizont. There is a clonal expansion of schizonts and then multiply by merging to form merozoites. The merozoites go into erythrocytes and invade the cells and are now in the piroplasm stage. When a tick ingests the piroplasms, the parasites undergo syngamy in the gut and can move to hemolymph. The motile kinetes can infect the salivary glands. From this, sporogony occurs to create sporozoites to continue the life cycle.  Signs and symptoms  Theileria parva causes East Coast fever which results from infected lymphocytes. East Coast fever has symptoms of anorexia, fever, enlarged lymph nodes which can cause lymphadenopathy. Less common symptoms include diarrhea and nasal discharge. A disorder called \\"turning sickness\\" can occur and is when the parasites in cells block the blood vessels in the brain and causes brain damage. This disease usually results in death but is very uncommon.  Diagnosis  Xenodiagnosis can be used to confirm the tick vectors but is not used routinely. Blood smears can be performed to detect Theileria but can be hard to differentiate from other species. Serological assays, including indirect fluorescent antibody test, IFAT, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, ELISA, are being used in research. For IFAT test, schizont or piroplasms are used from infected animals to identify transforming parasites. This method is economically friendly but is hard to differentiate between Theileria parva and other close species. ELISA is able to detect more specific antigens. Molecular assays such as PCR are continuing on the rise to be used but require more specialized equipment.  Treatment and control  Parvaquone and buparvaquone are used for the early stages of the disease and are very effective. As the disease progress, treatment is much harder to control and parvaquone and buparvaquone are less effective. Immunization for Theileria parva is available and consist of strains of Theileria from infected ticks with oxytetracycline, a type of antibiotic. This inhibits the parasite to develop. It is recommended to immunize cattle approximately 3-4 weeks before turning cattle out on to infected pasture.  Genomics  Theileria parva has four chromosomes and a plastome. In 2005 the sequencing of its genome was announced. T. parva has genes that allow it to attach to white blood cell (leukocyte) membranes, enter the cells and take them over. It then activates the host cells' mitotic pathway, and multiplies along with the host cells. When the genome of Babesia bovis, another protozoan parasite that infects red blood cells (erythrocytes) and causes Babesiosis (Redwater) in cattle, was sequenced in 2007 their genomes were found to be remarkably similar.  Future outlook  Research is being done to create a more effective vaccine for Theileria parva. Approximately 70% of cattle provided with the immunization were protected in a laboratory study. Research is being done to create a vaccine with a mixture of many antigens from sporozoite and schizont stage to increase immunity.

Twenty-two were built between the years 1937–1957. They were numbered 1000–1021. In the thirties there was a need for faster and heavier express trains in Finland, and the Hv1–Hv3 classes were not powerful enough to fill the need. Lokomo Oy in Tampere built first two prototypes, and after successful trials 20 more were built. Most of the locomotives were fitted with Wagner-type smoke deflectors, but the last two, which were equipped with roller bearings, had Witte-type deflectors. The nickname of the locomotive was meaning approximately \\"(respected) Grandpa Pekka\\", after the President of Finland Pehr Evind Svinhufvud. The Hr1 was built for coal firing, but during the coal shortage after the war in 1945, birch wood was used as fuel. Larger chimneys needed for extinguishing wood sparks were temporarily fitted. The Hr1s were the most important express steam locomotive and could justifiably be called the \\"flagships\\" of VR until 1963, when diesel locomotives started to replace steam. Their use ended officially in 1971, but two roller bearing Hr1s were returned for a short use in spring 1974. One engine, 1005, was a participant on the worst peacetime railroad accident in Finland, kuurila accident, in 1957. The engine is preserved at Haapamäki.

Facts Equitable Life (est 1762) issued ‘with profits’ life assurance policies, which are a way of saving for retirement. If policy holders took benefits as a taxable annuity (i.e. with a payment annually), then they got tax exemptions on the premiums (and bonuses at the end of the year). They could choose to have their annuity at a \\"guaranteed annual rate\\" (\\"GAR\\") that would be fixed, or a \\"current annuity rate\\" (\\"CAR\\") that would fluctuate according to the market. The choice did not affect the premium. From 1993 the current annuity fell below the guaranteed one. Article 65 of the Equitable Life's Articles of Association said the directors could, at their discretion, vary bonuses and the company had relied on this since its foundation. The directors of Equitable Life decided they would reduce the level of terminal bonuses for GAR policyholders, from the higher figure shown on the GAR policyholders' annual bonus notices, to a lower figure (if necessary to zero) so as to equalise the benefits so far as possible i.e. the policy proceeds with the higher terminal bonus times the CAR rate equalled the policy proceeds with lower terminal bonus times the GAR rate (the Differential Terminal Bonus Policy - DTBP). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns, submitted each year to the regulatory authorities (the Department of Trade and Industry - DTI) had set out this practice since the 1993 (when the current annuity rate first fell below the guaranteed annuity rate). The Equitable's Annual Regulatory Returns had been scrutinized each year by the regulatory authorities and nothing adverse had been said by the regulatory authorities about the Equitable's Differential Terminal Bonus Policy (which had been introduced in 1993). In 1998, because the GAR policyholders received a lower terminal bonus than they expected (they expected the higher terminal bonus and, in addition, the GAR rate) certain GAR policyholders complained. Mr Hyman was a representative policyholder. At no point, however, were the GAR policyholders ever paid less per annum (and nor was there ever any intention by the directors of Equitable Life to pay them less) than their guaranteed fund (i.e. excluding the non-contractual terminal bonus) times guaranteed annuity rate. Judgment The House of Lords unanimously agreed that there was an implied term in the Articles of Association such that the directors of Equitable Life could not exercise their discretion in the way they had because it defeated the reasonable expectations of the GAR policyholders as exemplified by Equitable having quoted the higher terminal bonus on each GAR policyholders' annual bonus notice (no other life office had quoted terminal bonus in its annual bonus notices to policyholders as terminal bonus can only be determined at policy maturity because of the volatility of financial markets). Although there was no express term in Equitable Life's constitution that constrained the discretion of the directors, it was necessary to imply such a term to uphold the policyholders' reasonable expectations. Lord Steyn gave the leading judgment.[2002] 1 AC 408, 459 Lord Cooke added that the discretion could be struck down, no matter how broadly it was drafted, in the same way as happens in administrative law (Padfield v Minister of Agriculture) and private law (Howard Smith Ltd v Ampol Ltd). The result of the discretion would not be consistent with the purpose of the policy. Lords Slynn, Hoffmann and Hobhouse concurred with both. £1.5b of annuities needed to be paid in full. Significance Equitable Life almost collapsed after the case, because it was unable to meet its additional liability to GAR policyholders, and had to sell assets and close to new business. It triggered an explosion of litigation and bitter recrimination among policyholders, directors, auditors, regulators and the government.

Under the firm’s disability insurance scheme, so long as he was an employee he was entitled to benefits while totally unable to work. He tendered his resignation in terms suggested by Faithful Ltd. Unfortunately that terminated his right to benefits. The scheme insurer stopped payments after one year. Was there an ‘implied term of any contract of employment that the employer will take reasonable care for the economic well being of his employee'? Judgment Dyson LJ, for terms implied in law one should not ‘focus on the elusive concept of necessity’ which is ‘somewhat protean’ but should ‘recognise that, to some extent at least, the existence and scope of standardised implied terms raise questions of reasonableness, fairness and the balancing of competing policy considerations.’ But it was inappropriate to imply such a broad term, and ‘such an implied term would impose an unfair and unreasonable burden on employers.’ Their interests conflict with employees so it is unreasonable for employers ‘to have regard to the employee’s financial circumstances when he takes lawful business decisions which may affect the employee’s economic welfare.’ The employer does not need to ‘act as his employee’s financial adviser.’ So there were ‘no obvious policy reasons to impose on an employer the general duty to protect his employee’s economic well-being.’?

After graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1823, Crosman served at various army posts in the Midwestern United States during the 1820s and 1830s. He was among the first army officers to propose the establishment of a U.S. Camel Corps to better transport supplies. As an officer in the Quartermaster Corps, he played a notable role in the Second Seminole War, the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. During the Civil War, he rose to the rank of brevet major general and held a number of important posts in the Quartermaster Corps, most notably as quartermaster of the Schuylkill Arsenal in Philadelphia, the army's largest supply depot of that era. Early career Born in Taunton, Massachusetts in 1799 to George Crosman and Amelia Keith Crosman, George H. Crosman enrolled in the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1819.Bowen, 907–908. After his graduation, he was commissioned second lieutenant in the 6th United States Infantry.

As a line officer, he was detailed several times for various quartermaster duties, including during the Second Seminole War, until he was transferred from the Infantry to the Quartermaster Department in 1838. Crosman was among the first officers in the U.S. Army to advocate the military use of camels for transportation of supplies. In 1836, he submitted an extensive study on the subject to his superiors, proposing a U.S. Camel Corps. Subsequently, camels were successfully used in several minor army expeditions in the desert regions of the Southwestern United States in the 1840s and 1850s. By the time of the Civil War, however, the concept of a Camel Corps had been abandoned.Field and Hook, 5. During the Mexican–American War, Captain Crosman served as an assistant quartermaster. Although his duties did not typically require him to be in the line of fire, he was nonetheless awarded the brevet rank of major during the Battle of Palo Alto \\"for gallant and meritorious service\\" when the supply train of which he was in charge came under attack. Civil War service During the 1850s, Crosman remained in the Quartermaster Corps. In the months leading up to the Civil War, he was stationed in Utah and held the rank of lieutenant colonel.Eicher, 192. With the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, Crosman was appointed Chief Quartermaster of the Department of Pennsylvania. During the summer of 1861, this military department encompassed all army installations and military personnel stationed in Pennsylvania, Delaware and Maryland. In this capacity, Crosman was in charge of distributing food and supplies across three states.Heidler, 587. After the Department of Pennsylvania was merged with the Department of the Potomac in August 1861, Crosman served as quartermaster for units in the field, most notably as quartermaster for the V Corps and later the II Corps in the spring and summer of 1862. Crosman coordinated supplies to these units, consisting of thousands of soldiers, during their involvement in the Peninsular Campaign and the Northern Virginia Campaign. In September 1862, Crosman was transferred to Philadelphia and served as quartermaster of the Philadelphia Quartermaster Depot, also known as the Schuylkill Arsenal, which was the chief supply depot for the U.S. Department of War.Heidler, 1584. Crosman served at this post for almost two years until August 1864. From September 20, 1864 to March 10, 1866, he was tasked with compiling a \\"Manual for the Quartermaster Department.\\"http://www.cclibraries.com/local_history/MexicanWar/crosmangh.htm He was promoted to colonel in the Regular Army in February 1863. On June 30, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Crosman for the award of the honorary grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S.A., (Regular Army), to rank from March 13, 1865, for faithful and meritorious services during the war,Hunt, Roger D. and Brown, Jack R.

However, on August 27, 1866, he was appointed Chief Quartermaster, Department of the East. Headquartered in Philadelphia, Crosman oversaw sale of surplus military property until August, 1867.[Philadelphia] \\"Evening Telegraph\\", May 5, 1866 (page 3, col. 5) through August 19, 1867 (page 7, col. 6) all at http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov After his final retirement he lived with his wife, Hannah Blair Foster Crosman, in Philadelphia.1880 U.S. Census He died on May 28, 1882 in Philadelphia.

The monument is in a small triangular downtown park, bounded by Division Avenue and Monroe Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History Plans for the monument were made, and fundraising started, before the end of the American Civil War. However, the effort languished until 1884, when the upcoming Seventeenth Annual Reunion of the Society of the Army of the Cumberland generated renewed interest. More funds were raised, and the Detroit Bronze Company, a subsidiary of the Monumental Bronze Company of Bridgeport, Connecticut, was hired to create the statuary. The monument was dedicated on September 17, 1885, during the Reunion. The dedication was attended by Governor Russell A. Alger and General Philip H. Sheridan, among others. The monument was restored in 2003, and again in 2014. Description The Kent County Civil War Monument is a thirty-four foot high monumental fountain, standing in the center of a sixteen-foot diameter basin. The monument itself has a seven-foot high base, three square upper sections above, with a Union soldier at parade rest at the top. The monument contains substantial detail, including eagles, flags, and military devices and equipment, as well as the names and dates of various Civil War battles. Detail also include portraits of Abraham Lincoln, Ulysses S. Grant, James Garfield, and Admiral David Farragut; a bas relief panel entitled \\"Woman's Mission of Mercy,\\" showing a woman helping a wounded soldier; quotations from Lincoln, Grant, Garfield, and Andrew Jackson; and plaques with the Michigan state seal and Grand Army of the Republic insignia. As was typical of many such monuments, the memorial was cast in zinc.

It was intended for entry into the 1912 British Military Aeroplane Competition, but was wrecked in a crash before the start of the competition. Design and development In December 1911 the British War Office announced a competition for a Military aeroplane capable of carrying a pilot and observer for the recently established Royal Flying Corps. First prize was £4,000, with the War Office having the option to purchase any of the prize winning machines.Bruce 1982, p.1.Flight 23 December 1911, p. 1109. Rear view of the Cody IV, showing the tail surfaces The American showman and aviation pioneer Samuel Cody, who had developed a system of man-carrying kites from 1901, built his first aircraft, the British Army Aeroplane No 1 at the Army Balloon Factory at Farnborough in 1908, making its first flight, recognised as the first powered controlled flight in the United Kingdom on 16 October 1908.Jarrett 1999, pp. 8–9. In order to compete for the prize money offered by the War Office, Cody decided to design and build a new monoplane, while also entering his existing biplane that had finished fourth in the 1911 Daily Mail Circuit of Britain Air Race.Bruce 1982, p. 15.Jarrett 1999, p. 15. Cody's previous designs were pusher canard biplanes, but the new aircraft was a tractor high-winged monoplane powered by a single 120 hp (89 kW) Austro- Daimler engine which had been fitted to an Etrich Taube which had crashed during the 1911 Circuit of Britain, which Cody had purchased after the race. It had a deep fuselage that accommodated the crew of two side-by-side. The tail arrangement was unusual, with two elevators and two rudders carried on four bamboo booms that led back from the fuselage, the all moving tail surfaces forming a box shape. Fabric was stretched between the tail booms giving a cruciform shape as seen in cross-section. Lateral control was by means of wing warping, and the aircraft was fitted with a nosewheel undercarriage.Flight 29 June 1912, pp. 581–582. Operational history The monoplane made its maiden flight on 21 June 1912, but on 8 July a cow ran into the path of the aircraft during landing. The resulting crash badly damaged the aircraft and killed the cow, although Cody was not badly injured. As the Circuit of Britain aircraft had already been wrecked in a crash, Cody used the engine from the monoplane together with what parts he could salvage from the biplane to construct a new aircraft, the Cody V biplane, which won the Military Aeroplane Competition.Bruce 1982, pp. 198–200.

Unlike his 1892 play The Weavers, Hauptmann focuses on the story's psychological rather than social dimensions.Jelavich (1984, 455). As with his 1902 play Rose Bernd, the play charts the demise of an ordinary man who falls victim to circumstances beyond his control.Jelavich (1984, 455) and Worrall (1996, 114). As with many of Hauptmann's dramas, it ends with the main character's suicide.Hartnoll (1983, 377). Plot Malchen Henschel is feeling sickly and feels she may die. She bandies words with Hanne, a gruff servant. Her husband enters, discussing his business as a drayman, carting goods from one place to another. Mrs. Henschel is jealous when she learns that her husband was kind enough to get Hanne's apron for her. If she dies, what would happen to Gustel, her baby daughter? Says Malchen: \\"One thing I tell you now- If I dies, Gustel dies along with me! I'll take her with me! I'll strangle her before I'd leave her to a damned wench like that!\\" and has Wilhelm promise not to marry Hanne after her death. Since the death of Mrs Henschel, Hanne is worried about what people say of her relations with the widower. Henschel reflects on Hanne: \\"The girl's a good girl. She's a bit young for an old fellow like me, but she c'n work enough for four men. An' she's taken very kindly to Gustel; no mother could do more'n she. An' the girl's got a head on her, that's sure, better'n mine.\\" Siebenhaar, proprietor of a hotel, encourages him to forget his vow to the dead wife. Now married to Henschel, Hanne is stunned on learning that he has brought with him her daughter, born out of wedlock, from the grips of her irresponsible and drunken father, though she denies that the girl is hers. The death of Gustel may be compensated by the arrival of Berthel. In the tap room of Wermelskirch's public house, several men grumble about the changes in Henschel's character since his second marriage, blaming Hanne. Says Walther, the horse-dealer: \\"Very well, I s'pose you're noticin' it all yourself. Formerly, you had nothin' but friends. Nowadays nobody comes to you no more; an' even if they did want to come they stay away on account o' your wife.\\" Hauffe, turned out of his job because of her, suggests that Gustel may have been poisoned by Hanne. Speaking of George, a waiter, Walther comments to Henschel: \\"Your wife an' he—they c'n compete with each other makin' a fool o' you!\\" Henschel challenges his wife: \\"He says that you deceive me before my face an' behind my back!\\" Says Hanne: \\"What? What? What? What?\\", to which Henschel responds: \\"That's what he says! Is he goin' to dare to say that? An' that ... my wife ...\\", after which Hanne says: \\"Me? Lies! Damned lies!\\", throwing her apron over her face and rushing out. Henschel is more and more despondent. In discussing his marriage woes with Siebenhaar, Henschel reminds him of his broken vow: \\"You know well enough!- I broke it an' when I did that, I was lost. I wa done for. The game was up.- An' you see: now she can't find no rest.\\" Husband and wife retire for the night. Says Henschel: \\"Let it be. To-morrow is another day. Everythin' changes, as Siebenhaar says. To-morrow, maybe, everythin'll look different.\\" But when Siebenhaar looks in at his silent figure in the bed, he tells Hanne that her husband is dead. History of the play Hauptmann began writing the play in 1897 and completed it the following year, when it was also first published.Jelavich (1984, 462). It received its première in Berlin, opening at the Deutsches Theater on 5 November 1898. The seminal theatre practitioner Konstantin Stanislavski directed a Russian-language production of the play as part of the second season of the Moscow Art Theatre.Benedetti (1999, 92, 386). Stanislavski worked on his production plan for the play during a holiday in March 1899 and rehearsals began in April; his score included the off-stage noises of striking billiard balls, coins clinking, and a banal waltz.Benedetti (1999, 92) and Worrall (1996, 115). The production opened on 1899.Benedetti (1999, 386) and Worrall (1996, 114). V. L. Yuren'yeva wrote of it: > The people are really alive . . . There is very little make-up and no > 'theatricality' whatsoever. They eat real sausage for breakfast, slice > cheese with holes in it from a square block. The housemaids smell of freshly > starched aprons and the rustle of their skirts can be heard about the stage. > The actors literally ignore the audience, acting for and between themselves. > They are swallowed up by their own feelings, weigh and absorb the eye > contact of their fellow actors.Quoted by Worrall (1996, 115). There were at least two other productions of the play in Russia that year—one at the private Korsch Theatre (which opened on 31 August 1899) and another at the Maly (which opened on 2 September 1899).Benedetti (1991, 51) and Worrall (1996, 114).

The hospital is located at Banawe Avenue corner Maria Clara Street, Santa Mesa Heights, Quezon City. History The Orthopedic Center was originally organized in Mandaluyong, Rizal by the American Army in 1945 as the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit (PCAU) No. 1, to take care of civilian casualties during the liberation of Manila and its suburbs. After it was turned over to the Philippine government, its functions were redirected to look after accident victims and orthopedic cases. Its name was later changed to Mandaluyong Emergency Hospital then, to National Orthopedic Hospital and Rehabilitation Medical Center. In 1963, the hospital was relocated to Quezon City. Its authorized bed capacity was increased from 200 to 500 then to 700. The hospital through the Hospital Chief, Benjamin V. Tamesis, MD, pioneered the introduction of Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy courses in the Philippines. Both courses were later absorbed by the University of the Philippines and was placed under the College of Medicine, then later became the School of Allied Medical Professions, now known as College of Allied Medical Professions. In 1982, it was renamed National Orthopedic Hospital- Rehabilitation Medical Center (NOH-RMC), and again to Philippine Orthopedic Center in 1989, by virtue of Batas Pambansa No. 301 and Republic Act 6786, respectively.

Based on the 2005 feature film of the same name, it revolves around a family dealing with normal family situations plus adapting to a new family setup after a divorced mother remarries. Ice Cube, Ali LeRoi, Matt Alvarez, Vince Totino, and Joe Roth served as the show's executive producers. Premise The series takes place in a continuity different from that of the films Are We There Yet? and Are We Done Yet?, and centers on the blended Kingston-Persons of Seattle facing the challenges of everyday life in a new blended family. Nick Persons (Terry Crews) and Suzanne Kingston-Persons (Essence Atkins) have been married for 6 months and former athlete Nick has sold his sports-memorabilia shop and taken a job in information technology. He is still trying to figure out his role in the family and bond with Suzanne's two children: Lindsey, who's forever texting on her cell phone, and Kevin, who's usually seen playing video games or playing with his best friend Troy. The kids' father is Suzanne's ex-husband Frank Kingston, who has a new wife and son. Suzanne herself has a very hectic schedule as a party planner. Nick's mother (Telma Hopkins) is not happy about her son's recent marriage or her new role as a grandmother and has a hard time getting along with her new daughter-in-law. The series draws its humor from everyday family situations. Though sharing the title and characters from the original film, the story is more similar to the storyline of its sequel, Are We Done Yet? as opposed to Are We There Yet?. Episodes Cast =Main= * Terry Crews replaces Ice Cube as Nick Persons, Suzanne's husband and Lindsey and Kevin's stepfather. New to marriage and fatherhood, Nick is an ex-athlete who works in technology. The only child of an eccentric mother, he possesses solid family values and a strong work ethic. Nick used to own a sports-memorabilia store, but he recently sold the business to his best friend Martin and got a job as a sports reporter at KAWT. Nick later becomes a part- owner in Martin's sports-themed bar/restaurant. * Essence Atkins replaces Nia Long as Suzanne Kingston-Persons, Nick's wife, Lindsey and Kevin's mother, and Terrence's sister. Suzanne is a modern woman with a career and love for her family. As a newlywed mother of two, she's trying to juggle family and career, while also trying to have a little fun. Suzanne is a successful event planner, known for her creative edge and attention to detail. She also has a childish wit. * Coy Stewart replaces Philip Daniel Bolden as Kevin Kingston-Persons, Suzanne's son, Nick's stepson, and Lindsey's younger brother. He is an avid soccer fan and can regularly be found watching his favorite player on TV. He also has a great interest in technology and computers. Smarter than his 10-year-old friends, Kevin is as precocious as he is lovable. He also has asthma, which was first seen in the 2005 film adaption. He loves to find his way around the rules and really wants to be the center of attention. Kevin is 10 in season one and turns 13 in season three. * Teala Dunn replaces Aleisha Allen as Lindsey Kingston-Persons, Suzanne's daughter, Nick's stepdaughter, and Kevin's older sister. At 15, Lindsey is a typical teen girl, who loves spending time with her friends and is attached to her cellphone. She has a strong bond with her parents and little brother, but she would prefer to hang out with friends instead of family. Lindsey often gets in trouble and she and Kevin often blackmail each other. * Christian Finnegan replaces Jay Mohr as Martin aka Marty, Nick's best friend who now owns a sports-themed bar/restaurant. Martin is a lovable rogue who is single and dating. Quick dialogue from an episode implies that he may have once had a relationship with Suzanne's friend Gigi. He enjoys life and his friends, and helps Nick with any problems with Suzanne. * Keesha Sharp as Gigi, Suzanne's assistant and best girlfriend. Always ready for a good time, she frequently jets to the hottest parties in and out of town. She convinces Suzanne to not blame Nick so much. * Telma Hopkins as Marilyn Persons (recurring, season 1; main, seasons 2–3), Nick's mother, Suzanne's mother-in-law, and the kids' stepgrandmother. She is constantly on the go and not available for babysitting. She's not thrilled about being any kind of grandmother and she isn't crazy about her new daughter-in-law, but Nick is her only child, so she has to adjust to his new life as a husband and father. =Recurring= 280px * Ice Cube as Terrence, Suzanne's paramilitary brother, Nick's brother-in-law, and the kids' uncle. Because he works for a Covert Government Agency, he is very secretive. He is protective of his only sister and uses every opportunity to remind Nick that he better be good to her, even by threatening to kill him. One of his running gags is when he points and says, \\"What's that?\\" and the person he's talking to will look away and will look back to see him disappear and hear the door slam. Ice Cube originally portrayed Nick in the films though he didn't reprise his role as Nick. * Charlie Murphy as Frank Kingston, Suzanne's ex-husband, Kevin and Lindsey's father, Terrence's former brother-in-law and Nick's rival. Frank neglected Kevin and Lindsey and is seen throughout the show trying to reconcile with the family, but Suzanne and Nick don't trust him. * Michael Hall D'Addario as Troy, Kevin's best friend. Troy is a huge fan of African American culture. He knows a lot for his age and is known to be very smart, although he possesses mostly street smarts. A gag of his is how he sometimes lies to his mother: Jackie, about his whereabouts, only so that he can scheme with Kevin. * Annie Q. as Kelly, Lindsey's best friend. * Jacqueline Mazarella as Jackie, Troy's mother. * Sherrod Small as Malcolm, Nick's friend. * Joe D'Onofrio as Staten Island Mike, Nick's friend. * Darrell Hammond as Brick Street (season 3), a KAWT anchor. Production and development The show is loosely based on the 2005 film of the same name and its 2007 sequel, released by Revolution Studios; however, the roles of Nick Persons, Suzanne Kingston, her two children, and Nick's friend Martin were recast for the series. The only cast member from the films to appear is the show's executive producer, Ice Cube, though he appears in a recurring role as Terrence, Suzanne's brother and the kids' uncle. Although the series is appropriate for all ages, it is not as family-oriented as the films. TBS greenlit the series in June 2009 for a 10 episode order, with the option to extend the episode order to 90 episodes.Are We There Yet' heads to TV Unlike most sitcoms, the production of Are We There Yet? runs on a schedule which allows three episodes to be filmed over the course of a one-week period.New TBS sitcom 'Are We There Yet?' triples filming pace.

It has an area of 18.2 hectares. The reserve was established in 2006. The land is privately owned but managed by Halland County Council. Skärte consists of two hills, covered with oak forest. Between the hills there is a ravine. In the ravine runs a stream, Stenån, which also passes through the nearby Gässlösa. In the ravine there are various vascular plants, such as Remote Sedge, Marsh Hawksbeard, Ostrich fern, Wood Stitchwort, Whorled Solomon's-seal, and Kidneywort. The old oak trees in the reserve are covered with lichens. Old maps show that Skärte was not covered with forest in the 17th century, but was probably pasture. However, there were large areas of contiguous woodland just a few miles away. In the 19th century, Skärte began to be covered with forest, and in the early 20th century the area was almost entirely wooded, with the exception of two small fields.

History  Beckedorf station, now a café The line was built by the Celle-Soltau, Celle-Munster Light Railway Company (Kleinbahn Celle-Soltau, Celle-Munster GmbH). It was intended as a branch of the Celle–Soltau railway that had been opened in 1902 as far as Bergen. On 23 April 1910 the latter was extended from Bergen to Soltau and at the same time the line from Beckedorf to Munster was opened. In the beginning it was a line that opened up and served the rural communities. As Germany re- armed prior to the Second World War several sidings to military bases (Poitzen, Munster) were built and, as a result, traffic grew appreciably. From 1940 the line was no longer treated as a light railway (Kleinbahn), but as a railway for public transport, as was expressed in the name of the new firm, the Celle-Soltau, Celle-Munster Railway (Eisenbahn Celle-Soltau, Celle- Munster).  Traffic  Passenger volumes climbed steadily to begin with and the branch contributed significantly to numbers on the Celle–Soltau line. As a result of military trains the numbers during the First and Second World Wars rose markedly. At least three to four pairs of trains ran daily between Celle and Munster, and there were additional trains between Beckedorf and Munster that had connexions in Beckedorf to Celle. Towards the end, railbuses dominated the passenger services, sometimes supplemented by a trailer. From 31 May 1965 Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) services began running to Munster and the OHE station was closed as a consequence. From 1967 buses replaced some of the trains. Passenger services were withdrawn during the 1970s: on 30 May 1970 between Hermannsburg and Munster and the rest between Beckedorf (Celle) and Hermannsburg on 31 May 1976. Freight trains mostly carried agricultural produce and even the transportation of logs played a role. Military traffic to the various sidings of military installations was also important. After World War II still more military facilities were added and tank-loading ramps were built at several stations. The railway played as special part during the Berlin Blockade in 1948/49 because RAF Fassberg was one of the start points for the airlift. Huge quantities of freight had to be dispatched daily and the airfield were supplied by goods trains including coal trains. Today goods trains only run on request.

One of the most tragic episodes in the history of Kendall County happened in 1862 after Texas joined the Confederacy. The Confederacy considered the free thinkers of Sisterdale and like communities to be a threat. A number of Kendall County Germans became conscientious objectors to the military draft. Confederate authorities reacted by imposing martial law on central Texas. 61 conscientious objectors attempted to flee to Mexico. Confederate irregular James Duff Texas State Historical Association and his Duff's Partisan Rangers pursued them. At the Nueces River, 34 were killed, and some executed after being taken prisoner. In 1866, Kendall County erected the Treue der Union Monument (\\"Loyalty to the Union\\") monument Texas Escapes – Blueprints For Travel, LLC.

Harrogate and District NHS Foundation Trust was rated 'Double Excellent' by the Care Quality Commission for the year 2008-2009. This score covers a range of areas including safety of patients, cleanliness and waiting times. The trust received an 'Excellent' rating in the Patient Environmental Action Team (PEAT) assessment undertaken in 2010. It was named by the Health Service Journal as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 2911 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4%. 72% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 65% recommended it as a place to work. In March 2015 the trust awarded a three-year contract to Comensura, based in Luton, a labour supply management specialist, for the supply of medical locums, hoping to reduce the £2.8 million spent on medical agency staff in 2013/14. In 2017 the trust established a subsidiary company, Harrogate Healthcare Facilities Management Ltd, to which 300 estates and facilities staff were transferred. The intention was to achieve VAT benefits, as well as pay bill savings, by recruiting new staff on less expensive non-NHS contracts. VAT benefits arise because NHS trusts can only claim VAT back on a small subset of goods and services they buy. The Value Added Tax Act 1994 provides a mechanism through which NHS trusts can qualify for refunds on contracted out services.

It stars Leonor Watling and Luis Tosar. The plot follows the pregnant wife of a renowned Freudian psychiatrist who enlists the help of her admiring brother-in-law to uncover the elaborate mystery of why her husband ran away from home. The more she digs for the truth about her husband, the more she discovers the unexpected lies surrounding her brother-in-law, her father, her sister, and herself. Plot In 1913 Barcelona, Alma, who is nine-months pregnant, returns home one day to find her husband, Leon, an eminent psychiatrist, about to flee their home and his practice. He has come back from a session with Dr. Freud in Vienna that has left him distraught. Left to have her baby alone, the witty and beautiful Alma enlists the help of her sister's husband – also a psychiatrist - the dispassionate, repressed Salvador, to help her solve the mystery of Leon's sudden departure. Ignoring his better judgment, Salvador agrees to help her, even though he sees it could be trouble for him with his prim, frigid wife, Olivia, Alma's sister. There is a sibling rivalry between Alma and Olivia that is shared by their husbands. Olivia is jealous of her feminist sister as the favorite of their father, Dr. Mira, the pompous chief of staff in the hospital where both Leon and Salvador have their practice. Helping her father, Alma serves as translator in a lecture by Dr. Alois Alzheimer – who is unable to remember anything. The beautiful Alma is as free-spirited as Salvador is uptight. Helping her, Salvador quickly runs into trouble. After an accidental self-hypnosis, he confesses that he is deeply in love with Alma, and that he married her sister, the ostensibly sexually inhibited Olivia, only to be near her. Still under hypnosis, traumatized by comments made by his wife regarding the size of his member, he exposes himself in a public place and his father-in-law fires him from his job. A trail of clues initially indicates that Leon's disappearance may be connected to the concealment of embarrassing revelations about the sex life of the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII. Hints also led them to the back room of a barn that serves as a hide-out for making pornographic films. They also visit a deranged woman in a mad-house, a cross-dressing club and a high-class bordello, led all the while by clues contained in Leon's thesis: a detailed journal of his psychoanalytic sessions with four women he is treating for “hysteria”: a psychotic woman who tried to murder her husband; an actress with a persecution complex; a woman with a serious crisis concerning her sexual identity; and a stranger who has discovered a terrible secret about her past. Salvador and Alma's investigation reveals a series of outrageous secrets. These include that Olivia has been living a secret life, going to a transvestite club. She has a lesbian lover and plans to leave her husband. Alma's alcoholic housekeeper, the unsympathetic Senora Mingarro, turns out to be Leo's biological mother, the result of a torrid affair with Dr. Mira, which makes Alma and Leon's marriage an incestuous union. The sudden reappearance of Leon only complicates things further. Eventually they all attend a distinguished gathering in honor of Dr. Freud, who has come to Barcelona to discourse on his new book, “Totem and Taboo.” Since Leon attributes all of his problems to Dr. Freud's theories on sexuality, he plans to kill him. However, the fall of a big chandelier aborts the assassination attempt. Leon and Dr. Mira die as a result of the accident with the chandelier. Olivia leaves for Paris where she wants to have a freer life with her lesbian lover. Alma gives birth to a baby boy. She realizes that she has fallen in love with Salvador and they become a happy couple.

He was arrested in 1984 and incarcerated on multiple counts of corruption, extortion, tax evasion, smuggling and possession of illegal weapons and cocaine trade kickbacks. Biography Durazo was born in the northern border state of Sonora and moved to the capital at a young age. He studied business and worked in the central bank for four years starting in 1944. In 1948, he switched careers to that of traffic inspector, moving on to becoming an agent of the Federal Security Directorate (DFS). At the end of the 1960s, he became a member of the infamous 'White Brigade', a right wing paramilitary police force made up to crush the student movements of 1968 and eradicate the threat of communists and communism in general in Mexico. In 1976, Durazo's childhood friend, José López Portillo, was nominated as the presidential candidate for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Durazo became López Portillo's personal security chief, and was rewarded with command of the Mexico City police when Portillo won the election, even though, eleven months earlier, Durazo had been indicted by a U.S. grand jury on narcotics charges. Durazo had a reputation for placing loyalty to his friends above all else. Once in the job, he reported directly to the president, bypassing the Mexico City mayor. Chief of police Durazo converted the police into a racketeering empireAlan Riding in Distant Neighbours, his book about 1980s Mexico. Although he earned less than $1,000 a month, he acquired two palatial homes, a collection of vintage automobiles and properties in Canada and the U.S. Durazo amassed a fortune in illicit wealth from the bribes paid by every cop in the city, the cocaine trade and kickbacks on the purchase of police equipment. Durazo was also known for his egomaniacal ways. He asked President Lopez Portillo to make him a five star Army Division General even though Durazo never served in the military. It was granted, and he proudly wore the five star insignia, ignoring the fact that Mexican Division Generals only wear four. When his personal convoy was on the move, roads were blocked to speed his commute. Mexico's inhabitants were mostly unaware of the methods Durazo's detectives used to keep crime under control until the Tula massacre, in which the bodies of 12 Colombians, alleged to be bank robbers, were found in the Tula River with signs that they had been tortured and executed; questions began to be asked. Arrest and death When an order of apprehension was issued for his arrest, Durazo escaped Mexico and reportedly, hid in several countries. Durazo was arrested in Costa Rica in 1984 by the FBI as he stepped off a private jet. He was held temporarily in U.S.A. and extradited to Mexico in 1986, where he was tried and incarcerated on multiple counts of corruption, extortion and cocaine trade kickbacks. Because of his ill health, Durazo was granted a $3M pesos bail on March 1992 and he was released, having completed only 6 years of his 16 year-sentence. Durazo died on August 5, 2000 at the age of 76. His Mexico City palace has been opened as a corruption museum and has become a popular attraction. His palatial house in Zihuatanejo built to resemble the Parthenon has been offered to the Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero by the government.Milenio: Ofrecen El Partenón de Durazo a la UAG References Category:People from Sonora Category:People from Mexico City Category:Chiefs of police Category:Mexican police officers convicted of crimes Category:Police officers convicted of drug trafficking Category:Police officers convicted of corruption Category:Police officers convicted of racketeering Category:2000 deaths Category:1924 births ","title":"Arturo Durazo Moreno"},{"id":"27107050","text":"__NOTOC__ Location of Cape Girardeau County in Missouri This is a list of the National Register of Historic Places listings in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri.

The highway runs between US 13 south of Fruitland and US 13 and US 50 on the north side of Salisbury. US 13 Business is a four-lane highway with divided and undivided sections that provides access to Salisbury University, downtown Salisbury, where the highway intersects US 50 Business, and Fruitland, where the highway meets MD 513. US 13 Business was constructed as a new alignment of US 13 in several steps in the 1930s and early 1940s. The section of the highway through Salisbury was originally constructed with four lanes, while the portion of the highway through Fruitland and at the northern end was expanded to a divided highway in the first half of the 1950s. US 13 Business was designated when US 13 was moved to the Salisbury Bypass upon its completion in 1981. Route description View south along US 13 Bus. at Livingston Street in Salisbury US 13 Business begins at a partial interchange with US 13, which continues south as Ocean Highway and heads north as the Salisbury Bypass. There is no access from southbound US 13 Business to northbound US 13 or from southbound US 13 to northbound US 13 Business. US 13 Business heads north as Fruitland Boulevard, a four-lane divided highway that parallels the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision track on the west past farms and scattered residences. Upon entering the city of Fruitland, the business route intersects Camden Avenue, which is an old alignment of US 13. After crossing Division Street, US 13 Business enters an industrial area and crosses Main Street. The highway continues north and intersects MD 513 (Cedar Lane) in a commercial area before leaving Fruitland by traversing Tonytank Pond. US 13 Business's name changes to Salisbury Boulevard and leaves the immediate vicinity of the railroad track as the highway passes through the campus of Salisbury University. At the northern edge of the campus, the business route meets College Avenue and reduces to a five-lane undivided highway with center turn lane. After passing through a commercial strip, US 13 Business performs an S-curve to the east and crosses Division Street right after the highway again begins to closely parallel the Delmarva Subdivision railroad track. The business route crosses the South Prong of the Wicomico River and intersects Main Street, the old alignment of US 50. US 13 Business passes West Church Street and the combined intersection of Broad Street and East Church Street on either side of the overpass of US 50 Business. East Church Street, which is one-way eastbound, connects traffic from eastbound US 50 Business to US 13 Business, while Broad Street, which is one-way westbound, is used to access westbound US 50 Business from US 13 Business. US 13 Business intersects Isabella Street and passes historic Union Station before crossing the Delmarva Central Railroad's Mardela Industrial Track line. The business route intersects Naylor Street, which provides access to US 13's original alignment, Division Street, before the highway temporarily expands to a divided highway to cross over the Delmarva Subdivision line on a bridge. US 13 Business crosses Peggy Branch and passes through a commercial area, heading northwest of the WBOC-TV studios, before expanding to a divided highway again immediately before its northern terminus at the Salisbury Bypass adjacent to The Centre at Salisbury shopping mall. US 50 follows both directions of the Salisbury Bypass, while US 13 heads south on the bypass and north on Salisbury Boulevard. There is no access between northbound US 13 Business and westbound US 50. US 13 Business is a part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial for its entire length. History The original north-south highway through Fruitland and Salisbury followed Allen Road north from Allen on Wicomico County's border with Somerset County to near the present intersection of Division Street and Camden Avenue on the west side of Fruitland. Division Street continued east to pass through the center of Fruitland before heading north to Salisbury, while Camden Avenue bypassed Fruitland to the west and headed directly toward Salisbury. The two roads reunited in downtown Salisbury just south of Main Street. Division Street continued north out of Salisbury toward Delmar. When the Maryland State Roads Commission (SRC) designated a state road system in 1909, the highway between Allen and Salisbury using Camden Avenue was designated a state road. The state road was completed from the southern limit of Salisbury to Main Street in Fruitland in 1912 and from there to Allen in 1913. The highway between Salisbury and Delmar was completed by 1921. US 13 was assigned to these state roads from Allen to Delmar in 1927. The first upgrade to US 13 in the Salisbury-Fruitland area occurred in 1930 when Division Street north of downtown Salisbury was placed on an overpass over the New York, Philadelphia, and Norfolk Railroad. In addition, an section of straight highway mostly paralleling the railroad tracks between Princess Anne and Camden Avenue west of Fruitland opened in 1933. The bypassed highway, which crossed the railroad tracks twice, was designated MD 529. The first portion of the first Salisbury Bypass, now named Salisbury Boulevard, was completed in 1938 between College Avenue and Main Street in Salisbury. The second segment, between the present intersection of US 13 Business and Camden Avenue south of Fruitland and College Avenue, was completed in 1939. Upon completion of the first two sections, US 13 was moved to the bypass and Camden Avenue was designated MD 663. The third and final section, from Main Street to Zion Road on the north side of Salisbury, was completed by 1942. After US 13 moved to the new highway, Division Street north of Main Street was designated MD 475. In 1951, a second bridge over the railroad was completed in north Salisbury and US 13 north of Zion Road was relocated and expanded to a divided highway. US 13 from the Somerset County line to College Avenue in Salisbury was also dualized between 1954 and 1956. The next major upgrade to US 13 was the construction of the Salisbury Bypass beginning from the northern end around 1973. The Salisbury Bypass was completed south to MD 12, including the interchange with US 50, in 1975. The US 13 portion of the bypass was completed in 1981; US 13 Business was assigned to the bypassed highway through Fruitland and Salisbury by 1983. The interchange at the northern end of US 13's part of the Salisbury Bypass had several ramps added during the extension of the bypass west to US 50 between 2000 and 2002.

On \\"Draguation Day\\", the women strut their stuff on the runway, perform their designated song and dance routine, and get graded by the judges on the DPA. The student with the highest DPA wins and is presented with a diploma and feather boa from her drag professor, performing the show's theme song. =Season 2 (2011)= When season 2 was green lit, an open casting call for women in the southern California area was announced through Facebook. Filming began in January 2011 and changes were made for the new season. The \\"top draguates\\" now win prizes, which includes a cash prize of around US$3,166.17. The former extra credit has been eliminated and have been replaced with \\"Lady Lessons\\", taught personally by Lady Bunny. The ladies attend a dance class taught by new Deans of Dance and then proceed to the newly renovated drag lab, where the women work with their drag professors on their new image. A new segment, called \\"Drag Tips\\" presented by a Drag professor revealing a few drag queen secrets. Another segment, \\"A Word from RuPaul\\", shows RuPaul at his desk giving a deadpan delivery of a single amusing word. The next day, \\"Draguation Day\\", has each professor introducing their student to friends and family. The ladies strut on the runway and perform for the audience. Students no longer receive letter grades but instead are sent backstage to the green room as the judges deliberate and decide on a winner. RuPaul is present, but does not influence the vote nor take part in it. RuPaul announces the winner and the winner's professor gives her her diploma and a feather boa in the university's colors of purple and orange. =Season 3 (2012)= Season 3 of RuPaul's Drag U began airing in June 2012 on the logo network. Season 3 featured returning professors as well as newcomers from seasons three and four of RuPaul's Drag Race. In the third season of Drag U, RuPaul's segment \\"A Word from RuPaul\\" was altered to include definitions of the word. \\"Drag Tips\\" continued, featuring a new professor each week, and Lady Bunny continued to host \\"Lady Lessons\\".

It is owned by Branson Visitors TV, LLC, a company jointly owned by Gray Television, owner of KYTV in nearby Springfield, and Market Branson. History The original construction permit to construct a low-power station on channel 17 in Branson was issued on March 3, 1993 and issued the call sign K17DL; on May 16, 1994, original owner Lorianne Crook-Owens sold the station to GEP, Inc. On July 26, 1999, K17DL, along with K05JQ (channel 5, now defunct) and Springfield-based K15CZ (channel 15, now KSPR-LD), was sold to Miller Family Broadcasting. By this point, channel 17 had come on the air through a series of special temporary authority grants and was simulcasting UPN programming with K15CZ; the station was fully licensed on January 14, 2002. Miller sold K17DL and K15CZ to Schurz Communications, owner of KYTV, on March 14, 2002. After UPN and The WB closed down to form The CW in 2006, K17DL and K15CZ affiliated with the new network. On May 20, 2009, Schurz sold a 49.9-percent interest in K17DL to Market Branson for $250,000; following the sale, the station dropped CW programming (moving to LD2) and began carrying tourist information. The station also converted to digital television and began broadcasting in high definition; consequently, the call sign was modified to K17DL-D on May 29, 2009.

Fr. Moses Orshio Adasu (12 June 1945 - 20 November 2005) became governor of Benue State, Nigeria on 2 January 1992, elected on the Social Democratic Party (SDP) platform. He left office after the military coup in November 1993 in which General Sani Abacha came to power. Background Adasu was born on 12 June 1945 at Mbaamena, near Awajir in Shangev-Tiev District of Konshisha Local Government Area of Benue State. He studied at St. James Junior Seminary Keffi (1966–1968).

Other projects that he started included BENCO roof tile, and the K/Ala fruit juice company, but he was not able to achieve a great deal during his short period in office. Adasu said that politics is not a dirty game, but those who are in it for selfish reasons make it dirty. He said \\"I am in politics to baptise politics and make it pure\\". He was removed from office when General Sani Abacha came to power in November 1993, replaced by Group Captain Joshua Obademi.

The buildings were listed for their architecture and their role in Knoxville's late-19th and early-20th century wholesaling industry. The district's original 1973 listing included the warehouses on the north side of West Jackson Avenue (i.e., 103, 121-123, 125-127, and 129-131) and Sullivan's Saloon (100 East Jackson). In 1975, the district was extended to include the John H. Daniel building (120-122 West Jackson) and the American Clothing Company building (124 West Jackson). During the 1980s, the north side of West Jackson Avenue's 100-block, along with Sullivan's Saloon and 120-122 West Jackson, were included in the Historic American Buildings Survey.Susan McCown, Historic American Buildings Survey Historical and Descriptive Data Form for Jackson Avenue Warehouse District (TN-212), 3 February 1986. The Jackson Avenue Warehouses represent Knoxville's thriving turn-of-the-century wholesaling sector. Most of the buildings along the north side of West Jackson were built circa 1890--1910, with loading docks facing the tracks and elaborate Romanesque storefronts facing Jackson Avenue. Rural merchants would travel to Knoxville via railroad from across East Tennessee to purchase goods and supplies for general stores and other businesses. Sullivan's Saloon, built in 1888 by Irish-born innkeeper Patrick Sullivan (1840-1925), is one of the few remaining late-19th century saloon buildings in Knoxville. In 1985, all of the buildings in the Jackson Avenue Warehouse District, along with the remaining historic buildings along West Jackson (all the way to Broadway), the Southern Terminal complex, the 100 blocks of East Jackson, North and South Central, and South Gay, the White Lily factory on Depot, and parts of State and Vine were listed on the Register as the Southern Terminal and Warehouse Historic District.

Until around 1800, when expansion of Devizes turned it into a suburb, Wick was a village. The area is in the south of Devizes and lies west off the A360, which passes from Devizes to Salisbury. History There was a Roman settlement at Wick apparently from the 2nd to the 4th century, around the area once occupied by Pans Lane Halt. There are also faint indications of another settlement on the green, and a cemetery on the site of Southbroom junior school. Wick is first mentioned in 1249 and is called 'the Weke' in 1542. In 1736–7 the settlement consisted of Upper Wick and Wick but in 1759 Upper Wick no longer existed. In 1773 Wick was renamed Devizes Wick, to distinguish it from Potterne Wick, further to the south. In 1795–6 the hamlet contained between 30 and 33 assessable houses. Wick was later known for its dairy industry, none of which exists today. Until its closure in 1964, Pans Lane Halt on the Devizes Branch Line served Roundway Hospital, a mental hospital which closed in 1995. The former hospital was converted for housing and Green Lane Hospital was built on part of its site. Today Today Wick is an entirely residential area, including a school and hospital. The original housing was built around the 1900s and most of the new housing was developed in the 1950s and 1960s. The newest housing development in the Drews Pond area was built in 2007. There is little room for any more housing due to the awkward geography that situates Wick on the edge of Devizes hill. It is roughly 1 mile from the centre of town. Most of the land surrounding Wick is woodland and arable. To the south of Wick is Drews Pond Forest, a popular place for walking.

Career Antonio Giménez-Rico obtained a law degree from the university of Valladolid.Torres, Diccionario del cine Español, p. 231 He also studied journalism and piano and worked on radio. He directed the film club at the university of Burgos and went to write movie criticism for the film magazine, Cinestudio.D’Lugo, Guide to the Cinema of Spain, p. 164 He began his apprenticeship in film productions in 1963, working as an assistant director in films directed by Vittorio Cottafavi and Eugenio Martín, among others. In 1966 he made his debut as a director with the children's film, Mañana de Domingo, (Sunday Morning), which was followed by a number of comedies like El Hueso 1968 and El Cronicón (1969). The failure of ¿Es usted mi padre? (Are you my father ?) (1970), led him to find employment on television. In 1970, Giménez-Rico began working extensively in state television for a period of years during which he directed the crime TV series Plinio (1972), about the character created by the writer Francisco García Pavón. He returned to motion pictures in 1976 with Retrato de Familia, (Family Portrait), an adaptation of Miguel Delibes novel, Mi idolatrado hijo Sisi, (My Beloved Son Sisi) dealing with members of a provincial family during the civil war, the film is widely considered as Giménez-Rico best work. It enabled him to make Al fin solos pero... (At last alone, but... 1977), which critics and audiences found disappointing. The little success he achieved with his next film Del Amor y de la muerte 1977 made him come back to work on television. He later made the highly acclaimed documentary film Vestida de Azul (Dressed in Blue) 1983, which combines a series of interviews with transsexuals with dramatized fictional scenes. On television Giménez-Rico directed the series Pagina de Sucesos (1985). This was followed two years later with El disputado voto del señor Cayo (The disputed Vote for Mr Cayo) (1986), which dealt with life in a Castillian village during the post Franco election of 1977. Another film adapted from a novel by Miguel Delibes. His following films failed to achieve critical or commercial success like his 1987 film Jarrapellejos, which was entered into the 38th Berlin International Film Festival.

He made the anti militaristic comedy Soldadito Español (Spanish Soldier boy) (1988), co scripted with Rafael Azcona, Cuatro Estaciones;(Four Seasons) 1991 and Tres Palabras (Three Words) (1993). These films failed to impress critics or audiences. In 1999 he was a member of the jury at the 21st Moscow International Film Festival.

The ruins are in the middle of the Lalmai hills ridge, and these are of a 7th-century Paharpur-style Buddhist Bihar with 115 cells for monks. It operated through the 12th century. Excavations have revealed many archaeological artifacts dated to between the 7th and 12th centuries. Most of them are kept in the Moinamoti Museum now.History of Ancient Bengal, First published 1971, Reprint 2005. Etymology Originally, the monastery was called Bhavadev Bihar after the king, but today the Shalban name comes from a grove of Shal (shorea robusta) trees.http://bdheritage.info History Introduction of Shalban Vihara in both English and Bengali language Before 1200 years ago the King Bhava Deva, the fourth ruler of the Early-Deva dynasty built that place on 168 square meters of ground. It was the royal palace for the early Buddhist students. This site, previously called Shalban Rajar Bari, came out after archaeological excavation as a Buddhist monastery and hence termed as Salban vihara from the terracotta seals and copper plates discovered. Its original name is supposed to have been Bhava Deva Mahavihara after the 4th king of the early Deva dynasty which ruled this region from the mid-7th to mid-8th centuries AD. It was built in or on the outskirts of Devaparvata, the Samatata capital bordering the Lalambi forest.Husain, A.B.M; Mainamati.Devaparvata; PP.41. Geography About eight kilometres west of Comilla town, lies a range of low hills known as the Mainamati-Lalmai range which is dotted with more than 50 ancient Buddhist settlements dating from the 8th to the 12th centuries. Almost at middle is the Salvan Vihara of 115 cells built around a spacious courtyard with a cruciform temple in the centre. About 5 kilometres north of Shalvan Vihara is Kutila Mura, which is a picturesque relic of a unique Buddhist establishment.http://www.yogsutra.com/historical.htm Importance This was once a self-contained Buddhist monastery where, monks lived, studied and prayed. It was the royal palace for the early Buddhist students. Students from various places come here for their meditation and religious learning. During their study period the students stay in the dormitory/cells around the temple. It's such a quiet place inside a barren forest and one of the greatest tourist spots in Bangladesh. Exploration and excavation Shalban Vihara View of Shalban Vihara, Mainamati, Comilla Deep diggings have revealed four repair and rebuilding phases in the monastery, the earliest corresponding to period III of the cruciform central shrine. No monastery remains corresponding to period I and II (7th century AD) has yet been found. Some scanty and ill-defined remains below the present structure may suggest their existence, probably of smaller size. During the next two phases (period IV and V: 9th–10th centuries AD) new floors and thresholds were built on top of earlier remains. Two interesting features observed inside the cells, fireplaces and ornamental brick-pedestals, were not included in the original plan. Though there was a community kitchen and dining establishment, many of the resident monks (probably sramanas: lay-students) preferred to cook their meals individually inside their cells. The pedestals certainly served the purpose of private cult worship. Discoveries made during explorations and excavations suggests that this establishment may probably have some provision for accommodating poorer lay students (sramanas) from neighbouring settlements with cheaper arrangements for cooking their own food with materials brought from home, an age-old practice still in vogue in certain parts of rural Bengal .Husain, A.B.M; Mainamati.Devaparvata; p. 34. Excavations at Shalban Vihara have also exposed a number of subsidiary structures including a community dining establishment, a small oblong, a pillared and a square shrine with exquisitely moulded plinth, two oblong chapels and a number of small votive stupas inside, and an interesting medium-sized shrine with a small sanctum connected by a long narrow passage and enclosed by a solid and massive brick structure, a columned terrace and colonnades just outside the monastery quadrangle.Husain, A.B.M; Mainamati.Devaparvata; pp. 39. Architecture Central of Shalban vihara The large square monastery of 550-foot sides with 115 monastic cells, a dominant central shrine and a number of subsidiary shrines. Stupas and chapels, provides access through its monumental gateway on the north. While the central shrine revealed six building phases and the monastery four. The 1st and 2nd phases of the central shrine remains buried under the ruins of the 3rd, 4th and 5th periods but the remains of the 6th phase have been removed from the top. The cruciform central shrine of third built with the monastery as a single complex. =Staircases= In the middle of each wing, the monastery verandah is provided with a shallow projection to serve as the base for a flight of steps leading down to the brick-paved courtyard, the arrangement in the front side being larger and more elaborate. Compared to them, the arrangement in each corner of the monastery is a grand affair. Here, occupying a pair of cells, a solidly built broad and massive staircase leads to the roof or an upper floor. Such elaborate arrangements coupled with the evidence of a strong roof naturally suggest the existence of an upper storey. =Chapels= The central cell in each wing is larger, stronger and more elaborate with certain special features such as small pedestals and platforms with decorative mouldings, larger niches, etc. By analogy to similar arrangements in Nalanda and Paharpur monasteries, they certainly represent subsidiary chapels or shrines. =Niches= Each of the cells were originally provided with three excellently built corbelled niches in the inner walls, the one in the back wall being larger. Objects recovered in and around them strongly indicate that these were primarily intended for keeping votive images, oil lamps and reading and writing materials. =The central shrine= The shrine at Shalban Vihara is actually not but six different structures built successively on the same spot in different periods and on different plans. They provide interesting evidence of the evolution and gradual transforming of the traditional Buddhist stupa architecture into that of the Hindu temple. The remains of the first two periods are hidden below the cruciform shrine of period III which was built with the monastery as a single complex. It is an exceedingly interesting piece of architecture resembling in ground plan a Greek cross, 51.8m long with chapels built in the projecting arms. Its basement walls are embellished with a string course of delightfully sculptured terracotta plaques set within parallel bands of ornamental bricks. This shrine bearing a striking resemblance with that of Paharpur represents a fully developed and finished example of the 7th- to 8th-century Buddhist temple architecture of Bengal. Since the Mainamati monuments are unquestionably earlier in date by about a century, and as there are a number of early and intermediary stages of development in this evolutionary process clearly traceable in Mainamati. Mainamati supplied prototypes of cruciform shrines not only for Paharpur and Vikramashila in eastern India but also for the subsequent Buddhist architectural development in Burma, Indonesia and Indochina. The next two periods (IV and V) witnessed an interesting further transformation and development in the plan of the central shrine, the cruciform shape being replaced by an oblong one. Now fully open, spacious and functional, it is much nearer to a Hindu temple. In these structural changes may lie the primary reason for discontinuing the earlier Buddhist tradition of the delightful terracotta decorations in the early Muslim architecture of Bengal, though in a somewhat different form. The main interest in these evolved shrines shifted from the outer walls around the circumambulatory path to the inner chambers with space enough for images, sculptures and architectural decorations, and specially to the principal cult images consecrated in them.Husain, A.B.M; Mainamati.Devaparvata; pp. 34–38. Materials found Newly discovered well in Shalban Vihara The finds from excavations at Shalban Vihara have been very rich and valuable which include seven copper-plate inscriptions, about 350 golds and a large number of sculptural specimens in stone, bronze and terracotta, and innumerable terracotta sculptured plaques found both in situ and otherwise.Husain, A.B.M; Mainamati.Devaparvata; p. 39.

The rebels overthrew the official Venetian authorities and attempted to create an independent state, declaring Crete a republic under the protection of Saint Titus (Άγιος Τίτος): the \\"Republic of Saint Titus\\". Crete under Venice Crete had been under Venetian rule since 1211, having been sold to Venice by Boniface of Montferrat at the time of the Fourth Crusade. Owing to its central location along the trade routes, its size and its products, Crete had a strategic importance for the Venetian rule in the Eastern Mediterranean. Occupied Crete was divided into fiefs and a colony known as the \\"Kingdom of Candia\\" () had been established, having as capital the city of Candia (present-day Heraklion). The land was distributed to Venetian colonists (both nobles and citizens) on the condition that they paid taxes, manned Venetian warships and defended the possession in the name of the motherland. The Venetians ruled Crete primarily for their own interest, driving Cretans to forced labour or conscripting them for the wars of the Republic. Since 1207 and including that of Saint Titus, Crete saw fourteen rebellions against Venetian rule. Saint Titus rebellion was the first in which the Latin colonists were actively involved. The revolt Venice demanded its colonies make large contributions to its food supply and the maintenance of its large fleets. On 8 August 1363, Latin feudatories in Candia were informed that a new tax, aimed to support the maintenance of the city's port, was to be imposed on them by the Venetian Senate. As the tax was viewed more beneficial to the Venetian merchants rather than to the land owners, there was strong objection among the feudatories. The news quickly reached the ears of Leonardo Dandolo, the duke of Candia (the colony's governor). After being informed about the feudatories' attitude, Dandolo summoned before him twenty of them and insisted that they conform to the Senate's order. Later in the day, around seventy of the feudatories gathered in the church of St. Titus, the island's patron saint. They decided to send three representatives to the duke, asking that the tax be suspended until a delegation had appealed to Doge Lorenzo Celsi and the Senate in Venice. Dandolo, however, refused to negotiate and ordered the new tax to be proclaimed to the assembled feudatories, asking them to consent on penalty of death and confiscation of property. The following day, disobedient feudatories stormed the ducal palace and arrested Dandolo and his counselors. Within a week, the revolt spread to the rest of the island and the commanders (rectors) of the main cities were substituted by men loyal to the insurgents. Marco Gradenigo the Elder () was appointed governor and rector of the whole island. The figure of St. Titus was selected as the emblem of the newly established Commune of Crete. Greeks were admitted to the Grand Council and the Council of Feudatories, and restrictions concerning the ordination of Greek priests were abolished. The revolt of St. Titus was not the first attempt to dispute the Venetian dominion in Crete. Riots fomented by Greek nobles trying to regain their past privileges were frequent, but these did not have the character of a \\"national\\" uprising. However, the revolt of 1363 was unique in that it was initiated by the colonists themselves, who later allied with the Greeks of the island. Being a state colony, Crete featured a fiscal administration imposed over both the Latin and the indigenous population, thus creating the potential of a sympathy and later an alliance between the colonists and those being colonized. This was emphasized further by the fact that at the time of the revolt, settlers had been living in Crete for two or three generations and an acculturation process had made the local culture more familiar to them than that of their homeland Venice. Venetian reaction News about the revolt reached Venice in early September. Crete being one of its major overseas possessions, the Senate considered the revolt to be a serious threat to its security, comparable to that posed by Genoa, its traditional enemy. Such was the concern on the issue that the authority for dealing with it passed from the Senate to the more powerful College. The first reaction of Venice was to attempt a reconciliation and send a delegation to Candia, expressing the hope that the colonists would again become faithful to the Republic of Venice. After the failure of this attempt, Venice proceeded to organize an army to suppress the revolt. Requests for help were sent to Pope Urban V, the doge of Genoa, Joan I of Naples, Peter I of Cyprus, Louis I of Hungary, John V Palaeologus and the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes. Most responded positively, expressing their support and issuing decrees that instructed their subjects to refrain from making any contact or providing any aid to the insurgents on Crete. The Venetian government assigned the leadership of the army it was assembling to the Veronese condottiero Luchino dal Verme. Illustration of a joust in the Piazza San Marco celebrating the recovery of Candia by Giuseppe Lorenzo Gatteri, 1863. In anticipation of the Venetian army, the insurgents had begun to argue on the best way to proceed. Eventually, they settled for sending a delegation to Genoa, asking for assistance and offering it control of Crete. However, the Genoese kept their promise of neutrality and refused to intervene, forcing the delegation to depart Genoa empty-handed. The Venetian expeditionary fleet sailed from Venice on April 10, carrying foot soldiers, cavalry, mine sapper, and siege engineers. On 7 May 1364, and before the delegation to Genoa had returned to Candia, the Venetian forces invaded Crete, landing on the beach of Palaiokastro. Anchoring the fleet in Fraskia, they marched east towards Candia and, facing little resistance, they succeeded in re-capturing the city on May 10. Marco Gradenigo the Elder and two of his counselors were executed, while most of the rebel leaders fled to the mountains. Having secured Candia, Venetian forces took punitive actions to discourage a future revolt. Rewards for the capture of the fugitive insurgents were announced, those having participated in the revolt were banished from living in any Venetian territory and their properties were confiscated. News of the victory reached Venice in June 1364 and was greeted with prolonged celebrations in the Piazza San Marco, which as poet Petrarch described in a letter, included mock battles, banquets, games, races and jousts. After the revolt, a new official, the Capitaneus, was appointed in Crete with the duty of protecting the Venetian dominion against any internal or foreign enemy. Rebellion of the Callergis The recapture of the principal cities did not signal the pacification of Crete. Despite the fact that the Latin leadership of the revolt had fallen apart, several feudatories were still hiding in the mountains and a significant portion of the Greek nobility, supported by Greek peasants, continued to harass the Venetian forces and settlers. The strongest resistance was instigated by the Greek Callergis noble family, who resided in the western part of the island. They carried the insignia of the Byzantine Emperor of Constantinople and proclaimed that their struggle was for the Orthodox faith and for freedom from Latin rule. Soon, the entire western part of Crete was in the hands of the insurgents, forcing the Venetian authorities to mount yet another major campaign against them. At the Doge's request, the Pope declared the war against the insurgents a crusade, promising remission of sins to those offering to fight in or support the war in Crete. The insurgents however managed to extend their domination further east, gaining control of most the countryside. Eventually, it was only in 1368 and after several attempts that the resistance was shattered and the Venetian rule was consolidated over the entire island.

Childhood Jory is a child of Hollywood character actors as his father Victor Jory played Jonas Wilkerson, the scheming overseer in the 1939 film Gone with the Wind. Jory received his Actor's Equity card as a young child. Work He was at the forefront of the regional theater movement of the 1960s, which began with the opening of the Guthrie Theater in 1963, showing that not all theater talent was centralized in New York City and Los Angeles. Jory served as artistic director of the Long Wharf Theatre from 1965 to 1966; his contract was terminated once the fledgling theater hit rough financial waters. In 1969, he took over the helm of Actors Theatre of Louisville, a small regional theater just five years old. Under his leadership, it became one of the top theaters in the country. Jory's major accomplishment was the foundation and cultivation of the annual Humana Festival of New American Plays in Louisville, beginning in 1976. It has since produced a number of outstanding plays including The Gin Game (1978), Crimes of the Heart (1981), Cementville (1991) and Dinner with Friends (1998), not to mention almost everything Jane Martin has ever written. In 2017, Jory began teaching at the UCLA Department of Theater as a Visiting Professor. Retirement and honours Jory retired from Actors Theatre in 2000. That fall, he joined the faculty at the University of Washington School of Drama as Professor of Acting and Directing. Also, in 2000, Jory was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame. He is the President's Chair of the Performing Arts Department at Santa Fe University of Art and Design. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Utah, the University of Louisville, and Bellarmine University. Asked if Jane Martin's identity will be revealed after her death, Jory has stated with a laugh, \\"That's a press conference no one will come to.

The film was promoted with an NBC radio series of the same title. Production After unsuccessfully attempting to interest the main Hollywood motion picture companies to finance his trips to make a series of shorts, Buck approached Amedee Van Beuren whose studio only made cartoons and live action short subjects released through RKO Studios. Van Beuren agreed to Buck's conditions that he finance all expenses of Buck's expedition, pay Buck with a share of the profits and not view any of the footage sent back until Buck was present, as Buck was unsure of how the images would actually look on film. Van Beuren kept his word and when viewing the footage they both realised they had enough film of high quality to make a feature film. Photography In Bring ‘Em Back Alive, unlike in most other jungle pictures of the time, director Clyde E. Elliott kept the camera in the background. Neither the camera nor the cameramen are visible in any of the scenes. The result is an infinitely clearer conception of the clashes between tigers, pythons and crocodiles than had been achieved in previous films.Mordaunt Hall. \\"Frank Buck's Exciting Adventures in Trapping Jungle Beasts\\", New York Times. June 18, 1932, pg 9. The movie was a huge hit, Elliott's (and Frank Buck's) most successful and popular film. Animals photographed Left to right: Cameramen Nicholas Cavaliere, cinematographer Carl Berger, director Clyde E. Elliott, and star Frank Buck ready to leave for the far east to film Bring 'Em Back Alive Among the scenes in the film: *A fight between a tiger and a black leopard, which, according to Buck, begins as a thrilling battle and winds up as a streetcorner brawl. However, the black leopard does get itself killed by a python. *Buck adopts a honey bear and a baby elephant, which is fed coconut milk. *An impressive struggle between a huge python and a crocodile, during which the crocodile's back is broken. *The climactic fight, the longest and fiercest of all, is that between the python and a tiger. The tiger closes his great jaws on the python, but the snake succeeds in saving himself, and as the fight goes on the reptile coils itself around the tiger until the cat is panting for breath. Finally, with a supreme effort the tiger frees itself and slinks off. The python is afterward caught by Buck and so is the tiger. The packing of the python gives the moviegoer a good idea of Buck's nerve, for he grabs the python's head and shoves the reptile into a wooden box. Behind the camera Scenes in the jungle were photographed from blinds erected whenever possible against the wind to prevent the human scent from blowing toward the animals. Elephants, Buck reported, are especially dangerous in that respect. Their sight is undeveloped, but their sense of smell is hypersensitive. Nick Cavaliere, one of the cameramen, had an encounter with the python who is one of the film's unwitting stars. The huge reptile was being photographed from a short distance when suddenly it shot forward, aiming at the film boxes, which lay under the camera tripod. The camera crew fled and the python began to encircle the boxes, probably suspecting them of producing the whirring noise which came from the electric motor of the camera. Cavaliere took a long stick and snapped off the motor, and the python lost interest, released its grip on the boxes and glided away.BRING 'EM BACK ALIVE review, New York Times, June 12, 1932. The wild animals did a good deal of their fighting where there was enough light to photograph them, but some of the fiercest bouts continued in the jungle growth where it was not possible to take a picture. Often Buck, Director Elliott and the cameramen had to run for their lives, the animals being much too close for comfort.Mordaunt Hall. \\"A top notch jungle production\\". New York Times. June 26, 1932. Reception New York premiere of Bring 'Em Back Alive The film earned to its distributor, RKO, an estimated profit of $155,000. \\"I shall never forget the premiere of the picture,\\" Buck later recalled about the New York opening. \\"The R.K.O. officials had decided it was so good that they would give it a tremendous ballyhoo, take a private theatre (the Mayfair on Times Square) and do the job in Hollywood style. On the day of the opening there was a line of people four deep and a block long, fighting to get into the theatre. On the big marquee were full-sized papier-mâché elephants and tigers that actually moved and waved their trunks and snapped their jaws. I made personal appearances, and for the first time people saw the face of the man who had brought to zoos and menageries of America the animals they had marveled at for so many years.\\"Frank Buck, All In A Lifetime. Robert M. McBride. New York: 1941, p. 207 Radio series Bring 'Em Back Alive was also the title of a radio series that aired on NBC October 30–December 18, 1932, as promotion for the feature film. Buck described his adventures to sponsor Alfred Carlton Gilbert, manufacturer of the Erector Set, during the 15-minute program. Bring 'Em Back Alive was revived on the NBC Blue Network and NBC Red Network July 16–November 16, 1934.

She is known mainly for introducing to Czech literature Modernist techniques employed by English-language writers such as Laurence Sterne, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf.  Life  Milada Součková was born into a wealthy family in Prague. She studied at the prestigious Minerva High School together with Milena Jesenská. From 1918 she studied science at Charles University in Prague, graduating in 1923 with a thesis on plant life. In 1923–24 she attended the University of Lausanne and met her future husband, the painter Zdenek Rykr. She wrote for several newspapers and journals, met the Russian linguist Roman Jacobson, and in 1936 became a member of the Prague Linguistic Circle. In 1940 her husband committed suicide to avoid falling into the hands of the Gestapo, and Součková left Prague to live in the countryside. During the occupation, she collaborated with writer Vladislav Vančura on his monumental work Obrazy z dějin národa českého (Pictures From the History of the Czech Nation) until Vančura was arrested by the Gestapo. In 1945, after World War II, she was appointed cultural attaché at the Czechoslovak Embassy in Washington. In protest of the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948, she remained in the United States as an emigrée. Jacobson helped her to enter an academic career in Czech studies, serving between 1950 and 1962 at Harvard University, then at the University of Chicago, and from 1970 to 1973 at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1959, she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for the study of Slavic literature. For the rest of her life, she worked as a librarian at Harvard's Widener Library. In 1986, after her death, Harvard College established the Milada Součkova Bequest, \\"for the purchase and use of Czech and Slovak books for the Harvard University Library known as Widener Library.\\" In 2016, director Andrea Culková released H*art On, a documentary about the lives of Součková and her husband, Zdenek Rykr. In the film, Součková is portrayed by Czech musical artist Sonja Vectomov.Jægtnes, H.

Work  The first literary experiments of Milada Součková were influenced by James Joyce and surrealism. Most of her prose work is stream of consciousness, imaginative, but sober. In her best works she experiments with language, but describes mostly the common daily life. In the US, she wrote mostly poetry in Czech and theoretical works in English. At home, she was unable to publish her literary work, either under the Nazis or under the Communists. Her last novel, Neznámý člověk (1962), was published in exile. Her collected works in Czech were issued in 11 volumes, from 1995 to 1997 by ERM (První písmena and Amor a Psyché), then from 1997 to 2010 by Prostor (all the rest). In 2010, Prostor received a Magnesia Litera for Publishing Achievement, in recognition of the importance of publishing Součková's work. = Novels = * První písmena (First Letters), 1934 * Amor a psyché (Amor and Psyche), 1937 * Odkaz (The Legacy), 1940 * Zakladatelé (The Founders), 1940 * Bel canto, 1944 * Hlava umělce (The Artist's Head), 1944 * Neznámý člověk (The Unknown Person), 1962; Der unbekannte Mensch (German translation; Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, 1999) = Poetry = * Gradus ad Parnassum (Steps to Parnassus), 1957 * Pastorální suita (Pastoral Suite), 1962 * Sešity Josephiny Rykrové (The Notebooks of Josephina Rykrová), 1981 = Literary history = * A Literature in Crisis: Czech Literature 1938–1950 (New York: Mid-European Studies Center, National Committee for a Free Europe, 1954) * The Czech Romantics (The Hague: Mouton & Co., 1958) * The Parnassian Jaroslav Vrchlický (The Hague: Mouton & Co., 1964) * A Literary Satellite: Czechoslovak-Russian Literary Relations (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970) * Baroque in Bohemia (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1980) References External links *Entry in Slovník české literatury (in Czech) *Entry in Intetrnetový slovníků spisovatelů (in Czech) *Collected works at Prostor editions (in Czech)  Bibliography  *Suda, Kristián: Eine unbekannte Autorin.

Malosky's 1980 team compiled a perfect 10–0 record, which was part of a 20-game winning streak, which \\"at the time was the longest in all of college football.\\" Malosky was forced to retire due to health concerns. Malosky had never missed a game, practice, or teaching assignment in 40 years. However, in May 1998, he suffered a mild stroke. He recovered from the stroke sufficiently to attend practices and games in the fall of 1998, but he realized that he \\"couldn't run the ship the way he had in the past.\\" At the time of his retirement, he was the winningest coach in NCAA Division II football history and ranked 11th among all college football coaches in all divisions.

It also charged three others living in the U.S., as well as four outside the U.S. These included Al-Arian's long-time top USF/WISE associate Ramadan Abdullah Shallah, who had been designated a Specially Designated Terrorist by the U.S. in 1995, and was accused of being Secretary General of the PIJ. The PIJ was identified as an international terrorist organization, with cells throughout the world, that supports jihad and martyrdom, responsible for the deaths of among others Americans Alisa Flatow (20 years old) and Shoshana Ben-Yishai (16 years old). In 1995 the PIJ, Syrian-based and largely financed by Iran, had been designated a \\"Specially Designated Terrorist\\" by the U.S., and in 1997 it had been designated a \\"foreign terrorist organization\\". A 50-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Tampa charged the defendants under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) with operating a racketeering enterprise from 1984 that engaged in violent activities, as well as: conspiracy within the U.S. to kill and maim persons abroad, conspiracy to provide material support and resources to PIJ, conspiracy to violate emergency economic sanctions, engaging in various acts of interstate extortion, perjury, obstruction of justice, and immigration fraud. The indictment alleged a ten- year conspiracy to support PIJ worldwide, help solve internal PIJ disputes and financial problems, help disseminate PIJ claims it was responsible for terrorist attacks in Israel, and raise funds within the U.S. for \\"violent jihad.\\" It alleged numerous PIJ-associated terrorist acts, resulting in the murders of over 100 people in Israel and the Occupied Territories. It claimed that PIJ, ICP, and WISE operated together as an illegal enterprise. It also alleged that the defendants used USF, where some of them were teachers or students, as cover and as a means to bring other PIJ members into the U.S., purportedly for academic meetings and conferences. Attorney General John Ashcroft Attorney General John Ashcroft said that Al-Arian and his co- defendants played: > a substantial role in international terrorism. They are 'material > supporters' of foreign terrorist organizations. They finance ... and assist > acts of terror. Our message to them is clear: We make no distinction between > those who carry out terrorist attacks, and those who knowingly finance, > manage, or supervise terrorist organizations. Al-Arian told reporters: \\"it's all about politics\\", and his attorney labeled the indictment a \\"work of fiction.\\" The indictment was later expanded into a 53-count superseding indictment in September 2004. It charged Al-Arian with: 1) conspiracy to commit racketeering; 2) conspiracy to murder or maim persons outside the U.S.; 3) conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization (the PIJ); 4) conspiracy to make and receive contributions of funds, goods, and services for the benefit of Specially Designated Terrorists (the PIJ); 5) use of the mail or any facility in interstate or foreign commerce to promote unlawful activity; 6) providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization; 7) money laundering; 8) attempt to procure naturalization unlawfully; and 9) obstruction of justice. Trial Al-Arian was tried with co-defendants Ghassan Ballut, Hatim Fariz, and Sameeh Hammoudeh in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida in Tampa, beginning on June 6, 2005. At trial, FBI agent Kerry Myers testified that the PIJ had planned an attack inside the U.S., but that all information about the plot was classified and he could not discuss it. Under cross-examination, Myers admitted that the PIJ had never carried out an attack outside Israel and the \\"occupied territories.\\" Myers also testified that during its 10-year investigation of the defendants, the FBI intercepted 472,239 telephone calls on 18 tapped lines. However, none involved any discussion of an attack against the U.S. or reflected advance knowledge of attacks in the Middle East. Furthermore, some of the conversations occurred before PIJ was designated a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1995.MegLaughlin, In his plea deal, what did Sami Al-Arian admit to?, St. Petersburg Times, April 23, 2006. The five-month trial featured 80 witnesses and 400 transcripts of intercepted phone conversations and faxes. At the end of the prosecution's case, Al-Arian's attorneys rested without offering a defense, and the trial concluded on November 14, 2005. On December 6, 2005, after 13 days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Al-Arian on 8 of 17 counts. It deadlocked on the 9 other counts, with 10-2 favoring acquittal. The jury deadlocked on what the prosecutors described as three of the most important four conspiracy charges against Al-Arian, including the charge of conspiracy to provide services to the PIJ. A co-defendant also was acquitted on some charges and faced deadlocks on others, and two co-defendants were acquitted of all charges. U.S. Justice Department officials said they were considering whether to retry Al-Arian and co-defendant Hatem Fariz on the jury deadlock charges, one of which carried a life sentence.Meg Laughlin, Jennifer Liberto and Justin George, 8 times, Al-Arian hears 'Not guilty', St. Petersburg Times, December 7, 2005. Jurors had mixed reactions. One who voted for acquittal said, \\"They have so little on [Al-Arian] that I'm disappointed. Most of us think he gave in because he was so sick of being in jail.\\" But one of the few jurors who believed Al-Arian was guilty on nine counts, causing a mistrial, said: > Like another person on the jury, I was convinced Mr. Al-Arian was still > working with the PIJ after it was illegal. He was a very smart man and knew > how not to be obvious. For me, the absence of evidence didn't mean there was > no evidence. For me, it suggested a coverup, which he admitted to, in the > plea agreement. Guilty plea, pursuant to plea agreement On February 28, 2006, Al-Arian signed a plea agreement in which he agreed to plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to contribute services to or for the benefit of the PIJ, a Specially Designated Terrorist organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. In return, the U.S. Attorney: a) agreed to dismiss the other eight remaining charges in the superseding indictment; b) agreed not to charge Al-Arian with any other crimes known to the government at the time of the execution of the agreement; c) agreed not to enter any recommendation as to the imposition or amount of a fine; d) agreed with Al-Arian that an appropriate sentence would be 46–57 months in prison; and e) covenanted that if no adverse information were received suggesting such a recommendation to be unwarranted, the U.S. would recommend that Al-Arian receive a sentence \\"at the low end of the applicable guideline range, as calculated by the Court\\". In the agreement, Al- Arian said that he was pleading guilty because he was \\"in fact\\" guilty.

At the plea agreement hearing, U.S. Magistrate Thomas B. McCoun said, \\" if you're satisfied you're guilty or you believe it's in your best interest to plead guilty ... let me know that.\\" Al-Arian replied, \\"I believe it's in my best interest to enter a plea.\\" The district court judge asked Al-Arian whether he had been promised anything else by anyone to induce his guilty plea, and he said that he had not. The plea agreement was unsealed and accepted by Judge James S. Moody on April 17, 2006. The count carried a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine, and three years of supervised release. Al-Arian remained in custody pending his sentencing and deportation. The deal came after 11 years of Federal Bureau of Investigation investigations, wiretaps and searches, and three and a half years of trial preparation, time Al-Arian spent in jail, most of it in solitary confinement.Meg Laughlin,Plea deal overcame the discord, St. Petersburg Times, April 24, 2006.

Homeland Security agent David Kane described alleged ties between Al-Arian and IIIT in an affidavit that was unsealed in 2003, saying that IIIT was once the largest contributor to a PIJ group run by Al-Arian.

He appealed the Virginia District Court decision to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower court's ruling.

It pointed out that the plea agreement did not contain any mention of whether Al-Arian would be compelled to testify in front of a grand jury in the future. It also noted that the agreement said it reflected all promises and agreements between Al-Arian and the government, and that this accorded with Al-Arian's statement, when questioned by the trial court judge, that there were no promises or inducements made to him other than those reflected in the written agreement. Furthermore, the court observed that the plea agreement only spoke to the issue of the government prosecuting Al-Arian for crimes known to the office at the time of the agreement, but did not immunize Al-Arian from future subpoenas. The court therefore held the plea agreement to be clear, unambiguous, and to not grant Al-Arian immunity from the grand jury subpoena.

The controversy concerned remarks made by Hussain in 2004, criticizing procedural issues in the U.S. terror prosecution of Sami Al-Arian. He \\"drew sharp criticism from conservatives for calling the prosecution of some terror suspects 'politically motivated,' a comment both Hussain and The White House denied.\\" The Council on Foreign Relations stated that, \\"The controversy led to a larger question of whether the United States should engage the Organization of Islamic Conference diplomatically.\\" In 2004, while a student at Yale, Hussain attended a Muslim Students Association conference in Chicago and participated in a panel discussion on civil rights. Laila Al-Arian, a daughter of Sami Al-Arian, was also on the panel. During the discussion, Hussain made critical statements about the US terror prosecution of Sami Al-Arian and other terrorism suspects, such as Chaplain James Yee and Brandon Mayfield.[20] According to recordings obtained by Politico in 2010, Hussain referred to the cases as examples of \\"politically motivated prosecutions.\\" [20] He was careful to say that he was not offering an opinion on whether Al-Arian was guilty of the charges that he was a top leader of the U.S. branch of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, a \\"specially designated terrorist\\" organization.[20][21] In 2006, Al-Arian pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to help the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, was sentenced to 57 months in prison (in other words, time served), and agreed to be deported following his prison term.[21][22] Opinions differ on whether the recording shows that Hussain using the term \\"prosecutions,\\" or \\"persecutions,\\" and whether he said that the prosecutions were \\"used to squash political dissent,\\" quotations from a 2004 story that Hussain denied making.[23] After the controversy over the statements, Press Secretary Robert Gibbs expressed continued White House confidence in Hussain, noting, \\"This is an individual that has written extensively on why some have used religious devices like the Qur'an to justify this [terrorism] and why that is absolutely wrong. And has garnered support from both the left and the right so we obviously have confidence.\\" Originally, journalist Shannon Bream of Fox News reported that The White House attributed the \\"controversial remarks defending al-Arian\\" to Laila al-Arian. Later, Jake Tapper, the Senior White House Correspondent for ABC News, reported that the \\"controversy was all the more confusing because the remarks were reported in the WRMEA in 2004, but the editor, Delinda Hanley, later removed the comments from the Web site, though she didn't recall why. In an email to Politico, Delinda C. Hanley, editor of the WRMEA, wrote that \\"Laila Al-Arian said the things attributed to Rashad Hussain, and an intern who attended the event and wrote up the article made an error, which was corrected on our Web site by deleting the two quotes in their entirety.\\" Later, in the April 2010 edition of WRMEA, Hanley wrote: > Four or five years after the above item was published, this writer received > a phone call or a phone message, I honestly can't remember, on a date I > can't recall—we get so many calls I'm lucky if I can remember a conversation > a week later!—saying Hussain had been misquoted in Kandil's article.

In The Washington Post article titled Rashad Hussain, a Muslim and new U.S. envoy, is bridge between two worlds, Hussain is quoted as saying that his \\"extensive writings on this topic make it clear that I condemn terrorism unequivocally in all its forms. I'd be happy to put that against one sentence from 2004 that I believe was taken out of context.\\" In his May 11, 2010 interview with Asharq Al-Awsat, Hussain was asked, \\"During your studies in law college in University of Yale you have criticize Sami Al-Aryan's trial and you have considered it represents a kind of politically motivated prosecution. Do you think that the courts in U.S. still suffer from identification of terrorism with the Muslims?\\" Hussain responded, \\"You know in that case that I said very clearly on the panel that I wasn't commenting on any of the specific allegations on him but I was making a comment about the process that was used in that case.\\"  References  External links *Links to 2006-2007 trial coverage from the St. Petersburg Times Category:Terrorism in the United States ","title":"Sami Al-Arian indictments and trial"},{"id":"27107758","text":"Transport and Communications Ministry building Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Lithuania is the main institution in Lithuania, which coordinates the work of road, rail, air, water, transport, postal and electronic communications sector and implements the strategy and politics of state government.
